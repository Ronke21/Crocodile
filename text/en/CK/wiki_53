<text>Polillo, officially the Municipality of Polillo (), is a municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 31,908 people.

==Etymology==
Padre Morga wrote that &quot;Polillo&quot; originated from the Chinese word &quot;Pulilu,&quot; which means a beautiful island with plenty of food. It was home to a native barangay-state also known as Pulilu, recorded as such in Chinese chronicles. The island was mentioned as being politically connected to the nation of Sandao, itself a vassal state to the nation of Ma-i. Due to language difficulties, a Spanish friar by the name Padre Domingo eventually changed the name from Pu Li Lu to Polillo.

==History==
===Pre-Spanish period===
Trade relations between the natives of the Polillo Islands and Chinese merchants existed long before the Spanish conquerors came to the archipelago. Trade was a conglomeration of Malay-Hindu-Chinese-Tagalog.

===Spanish colonization and early settlement===
When Juan de Salcedo, a Spanish conqueror, came to Polillo in 1567, he saw a central government fully organized through the Balangay, with a datu who had a direct supervision and control over all the natives. The inhabitants lived in nipa huts.

In 1571, the Spaniards took hold of the islands of Pu Li Lu. Through the leadership of Padre Domingo, a Spanish friar, a chapel was built, where the old Spanish church was later constructed. After one and a half years, the people, through forced labor built a concrete wall to protect the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Pu Li Lu from moro pirate invaders. Watchtowers called &quot;castillos&quot; were erected in the four corners of the pueblo.

The church was constructed in 1577. Boulders, gravel and sand were mixed with lime produced out of seashells and coral stones. Padre Domingo instigated the planting of sugar cane in San Isidro, San Antonio and San Francisco. Production of molasses was put into full swing.

===Foundation===
Spanish conquistadores were assigned to the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Pu Li Lu to promote church construction. The church tower was constructed with priority, so that in 1587, in the early summer of May, two huge bronze bells rang atop. Due to language problems, Padre Domingo changed the name from Pu Li Lu to Polillo.

However, there is inconsistency regarding Polillo&#x27;s foundation, with some sources and the municipal government claiming it was established as a town in 1587 when the church bells were first rung, while others indicate that it was formally founded as an independent town in 1635 by Franciscan missionaries.

In 1609, Polillo was part of the encomienda of Don Francisco Morante de Nueva. Initially, it served as a &quot;visita&quot; of Binangonan de Lampon (now Infanta). In 1635, Polillo was officially separated from Binangonan de Lampon and established as an independent town by Franciscan missionaries, with Fray Jose S. de Bernardino appointed as its first leader. In 1658, the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects, who managed it until 1703, after which the Franciscan missionaries resumed administration. Polillo served as the seat of government under Spanish rule for the Polillo Islands, with the present-day towns of Burdeos, Panukulan, Patnanungan, and Jomalig once being part of Polillo as barrios.

===World War II===
In 1942, the occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Polillo.

In 1945, the liberation by the Philippine Commonwealth troops of the 5th and 52nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army landed in Polillo we fought the battles against the Japanese forces in the Battle of Polillo Island during World War II.

===Contemporary history===
On June 18, 1961, the barrios such as Bucal, Casuguran, Gango, and Talisoy on Jomalig Island were separated from Polillo to become a separate municipal district named Jumalig (Jomalig) by virtue of Republic Act No. 3372.

In 1987, three weeks before the April 18 coup attempt against the national government, cadres of the New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) attacked the Philippine Constabulary detachment in Polillo Island. 

In recent years, government-funded infrastructures were built and private investments in hotel, resorts, services and utilities increased.

On March 26, 2021, two NPA members surrendered to government forces in Barangay Salipsip. On February 21, 2022, the Armed Forces of the Philippines fought an armed encounter with the New People&#x27;s Army in Barangay Binitbitinan. The NPA eventually withdrew.

==Geography==

<doc id="1134049" wikidata="Q28653" url="?curid=1134049" title="Mendicant orders">
<text>Mendicant orders are primarily certain Catholic religious orders that have vowed for their male members a lifestyle of poverty, traveling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to less wealthy individuals. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model, which prescribed living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. The members of these orders are not called monks but friars. 

The term &quot;&quot; is also used with reference to some non-Christian religions to denote holy persons committed to an ascetic lifestyle, which may include members of religious orders and individual holy persons.

== Active orders ==
The Second Council of Lyon (1274) recognised four main mendicant orders, created in the first half of the 13th century:
* Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (Carmelites) first historical recorded in 1155 and their reform branch, the Discalced Carmelites (established in the 16th century)
* Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans) founded 1209
* Order of Preachers (Dominicans) founded 1216
* Order of Saint Augustine (Augustinians) founded in 1244
Other mendicant orders recognized by the Holy See today are the

* Order of the Most Blessed Trinity (Trinitarians) sometimes called the Red Friars, founded 1193
* Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy (Mercedarians) founded 1218 and after a reform Discalced Mercedarians.
* Order of Servants of Mary (Servites) founded 1233 by the Seven Holy Men of Florence, Italy. The order was suppressed by the Second Council of Lyon on the basis of the restrictions in the decree &quot;Ne nimium&quot; of 1215; the suppression was not fully enforced and was subsequently overturned by Pope Benedict XI in his Bull, &quot;Dum levamus&quot;, of 11 February 1304.
* Order of Minims (hermits of St. Francis of Paola) founded 1436.
* Other Franciscan orders:
** Order of Friars Minor Conventual
** Order of Friars Minor Capuchin
* Hospitaller Order of the Brothers of Saint John of God founded in 1572 by John of God.
* Order of the Poor Clerics Secular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools (Piarists) founded in 1617 by Joseph Calasanz.
* Order of Bethlehemite Brothers, founded in Guatemala in 1653 and suppressed in 1820. They were refounded in 1984.

Like the monastic orders, many of the mendicant orders (especially the larger ones) underwent splits and reform efforts, forming offshoots (permanent or otherwise) some of which are mentioned in the lists given above.

==Former orders==
Former mendicant orders that are now extinct:
* Ambrosians or &quot;Fratres sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot;, existed before 1378, suppressed by Pope Innocent X in 1650.
* Fraticelli of Monte Malbe, founded at Monte Malbe near Perugia, Italy, in the 14th century; by the end of the century they had dispersed.
* Hospitallers of San Hipólito (Saint Hippolytus) or Brothers of Charity of de San Hipólito were founded in Mexico and approved by Rome as a mendicant order in 1700. In the 18th century they were absorbed by the Brothers Hospitaller of Saint John of God.
* Jesuati, or &quot;Clerici apostolici Sancti Hieronymim,&quot; Apostolic clerics of Jerome, founded in 1360, suppressed by Pope Clement IX in 1668.
* Saccati or &quot;Friars of the Sack&quot; &quot;(Fratres Saccati)&quot;, known also variously as Brothers of Penitence and perhaps identical with the &quot;Boni homines&quot;, &quot;Bonshommes&quot; or &quot;Bones-homes&quot;, whose history is obscure.
* Crutched Friars or &quot;Fratres Cruciferi&quot; (cross-bearing friars) or Crossed Friars, Crouched Friars or Croziers, named after the staff they carried which was surmounted by a crucifix, existed by 1100, suppressed by Pope Alexander VII in 1656.
* Scalzetti, founded in the 18th century, suppressed by Pope Pius XI in 1935.
Orders no longer mendicant:
* Jesuits or Society of Jesus, founded in 1540, and for a time considered a mendicant order, before being classed instead as an Order of Clerics Regular.
Orders considered heretical by the Catholic Church:
* Dulcinians

Jitish Kallat was born in 1974 in Mumbai, India. In 1996 he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting from the Sir JJ School of Art in Mumbai.

==Career==
Having received his BFA in painting in 1996, Kallat had his debut solo exhibition titled &quot;PTO&quot; at Chemould Prescott Road. His large-format paintings and drawings already had in them the themes that would recur throughout his work until today. With the self at the centre of an unfolding narrative, these paintings were connected to ideas of time, death, cycles of life, references to the celestial, and familial ancestry. It was only in the next three or four years that an image of the city, otherwise seen at the margins of his paintings, began to take centre stage. In those days Kallat referred to the city street as his university, often carrying within it pointers to the perennial themes of life that have remained a subtext to his work that have taken form in diverse media. &quot;Other indigenous painters before him had flirted with international styles such as Pop (most notably Jyothi Bhatt and Bhupen Khakhar ) and the mix and match of Postmodernism (namely Gulammohammed Sheikh and Atul Dodiya), but no one had turned the textures and surfaces of urban India into the fracture of painting quite so successfully,&quot; noted artist, gallerist, and co-director of Nature Morte, Peter Nagy in an essay titled &quot;Jitish Kallat: 21st Century Boy&quot;. &quot;Parts of Kallat&#x27;s canvases appear as if they had been left outdoors during the monsoon season, other sections seem blistered and scorched by the unrelenting sun. The works usually appear much older than they actually are, aged as soon as they are born, not unlike all manner of objects and people through the subcontinent. The distressed and tortured surfaces create a field in which to submerge images while the images themselves are processed and mutilated in a variety of ways. All of which combine to create works that both participate intimately with the artist&#x27;s mise en scene and comment upon the unique idiosyncrasies of his home. Degradation, bastardisation, the destruction and retrieval of culture and history became Kallat&#x27;s subjects through the astute handling of both subject matter and technique.&quot;

Kallat’s work has also developed in response to museum collections in the case of projects such as &quot;Field Notes, (Tomorrow was here yesterday) (2011)&quot; at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai, for which he was shortlisted for The Skoda Prize in 2012, or &quot;Circa,&quot; at the Ian Potter Museum in Melbourne. Both these projects had several of his recurring preoccupations find their form and structure in conversation with the museum viewed both as an infrastructure of signs but equally a field of stimuli and meaning.

Often works which begin with a private narrative or an autobiographical impulse might be materialized in a form where the self remains invisible within the space of the artwork and could often be traced back by observing several bodies of work alongside each other. The theme of time, for instance, could be rendered as date in works such as &quot;Public Notice 3&quot;, where two historical moments are overlaid like a palimpsest or in works such as &quot;Epilogue&quot;, every moon that his father saw in his lifetime becomes a labyrinth of fullness and emptiness with the image of the moon morphing with the form of a meal.

Kallat is known for working with a variety of media, including painting, large-scale sculpture installations, photography, and video art. He employs a bold and vivid visual language that references both Asian and European artistic traditions, along with popular advertising imagery that fuels urban consumerism. Kallat regularly exploits images and materials chanced upon around Mumbai&#x27;s sprawling metropolis, affording his works an inherent spontaneity and a handcrafted aesthetic. He unites these various media through themes that endure within Kallat&#x27;s work, such as the relationship between the individual and the masses. He references his own personal experiences and those of Mumbai&#x27;s other inhabitants. His work speaks of both the self and the collective, fluctuating between intimacy and monumentality, and characterized by contrasting themes of pain, hope and survival.

Kallat&#x27;s paintings address the problem of painting in an age dominated by mass media, writes art dealer and collector, Amrita Jhaveri, in &quot;A Guide to 101 Modern &amp; Contemporary Indian Artists&quot;. &quot;Using images from newspapers and magazines, advertising billboards, wallpaper and graffiti, his works are richly layered and replete with metaphor. Kallat has reinvented the painted surface to mimic the appearance of a television still or a computer monitor, complete with its surface striations and auras.&quot;

==Work==

Much of Kallat’s work has been based on his encounters with the multi-sensory environment of Bombay/Mumbai, as well as the economic, political and historical events that have contributed to its making, wrote art historian Chaitanya Sambrani. &quot;His practice as painter has frequently highlighted a concern he shares with the founders of Indian modernism in visual and literary art. Kallat has couched his references to the “underdog” in a hyper-pop language in order to signal the ironies that attend the lives of migrant workers and menial labourers in India’s megacities: people met on “second class” train compartments, people whose labour continues to keep afloat the nation’s aspirations. In his installation and video practice, he has often revisited archival texts and museum displays with a view to probing the production and dissemination of knowledge.&quot;

In her essay, &quot;The Mumbai Syndrome,&quot; Patricia Ellis vouches for Kallat&#x27;s engagement with painting as a subversively radical activity. &quot;His approach has little to do with representation, abstraction, or formalism, but rather a total mimesis of concept,&quot; His paintings are &quot;not localised images constrained within borders, complications of space and perception, or even platitudes of self-defined invention. They&#x27;re conceived as liminal gaps: peripheral mediations, metaphysical platforms of interconnection.&quot;

Public Notice

For the first in what would be termed as his Public Notice series, Kallat revisited the famous speech made by Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru before the stroke of midnight on 14 August 1947, to commemorate India&#x27;s Independence against the British. Often recalled as the &quot;Tryst with Destiny&quot; speech, the historic address spoke of India&#x27;s awakening into freedom after centuries of colonialism. Kallat hand-rendered the iconic text using rubber adhesive on five large acrylic mirrors before setting them aflame, thereby incinerating the words and producing mangled reflections that changed in relation to the viewer&#x27;s position against the burnt glass. The 2003 piece was a political statement Kallat was making against the carnage of the Godhra Riots in February 2002. &quot;The words are cremated... much as the content of the speech itself was distorted by the way the nation has conducted itself in the last six decades,&quot; Kallat has said about the work.

Public Notice 2

Created in 2007, Kallat&#x27;s &quot;Public Notice 2&quot; is a large-scale display of letters formed out of 4,479 pieces of fibreglass bones installed on shelves against a background of saturated turmeric yellow reproducing the 1000-word speech given by Mahatma Gandhi on 11 March 1930 at the Sabarmati Ashram by the banks of the River Sabarmati in Ahmedabad a day before he along with 78 of his followers began the historic Dandi March to protest against the British-imposed tax on salt during which the virtues of Non-Violence were repeatedly insisted on by Gandhi. &quot;The act of rehearsing a text from modern history and meditating on its relevance today is charged with a revisionary historicism: Kallat simultaneously places the text within its particular historical moment and reinvigorates it for present purposes,&quot; art historian Chaitanya Sambrani wrote in an essay titled &quot;Of Bones and Salt: Jitish Kallat&#x27;s Public Notice 2&quot;. &quot;The first activity, that of historical situation, locates the text securely in the past; the second asks us to reconsider it so as to glean an insight into present exigences and possibilities for the future.&quot; The work, according to Sambrani, represents &quot;evidence of the past, scientifically gathered, enumerated, classified and sorted into significant units.&quot;

Public Notice 3

In 2010 the artist installed his large-scale site-specific LED installation, &quot;Public Notice 3&quot;, at the Art Institute of Chicago. This installation was Kallat&#x27;s first major exhibition at a US institution. The artwork links two disparate yet connected historical events, the First World Parliaments of Religions, held in September 1893, and the much later terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, in September 2001. Kallat&#x27;s 2004 piece &quot;Detergent&quot; could be seen as the prototype for &quot;Public Notice 3&quot;, a text-based work in which Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s speech was rendered in the same way as in &quot;Public Notice&quot;. According to Madhuvanti Ghose, &quot;Finally, Kallat&#x27;s &quot;Detergent&quot; came &#x27;home&#x27; when as &quot;Public Notice 3&quot; it opened on September 11, 2010, at the Art Institute of Chicago. Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s evocative words calling for universal toleration and the end of bigotry and religious fanaticism were presented on the Woman&#x27;s Board Grand Staircase, a space approximating the stages of the two temporary halls in which he originally spoke: the Hall of Columbus, where his opening address had been delivered; and the Hall of Washington-an area now largely occupied by the museum&#x27;s Ryerson Library-where Vivekananda spoke on other occasions during the World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions.&quot;

<text>Sleepy Township was an indie pop band which was formed in Perth, Western Australia in 1994 as a side project by Guy Blackman (guitar, electric organ, vocals), Mia Schoen (Molasses) (guitar, electric organ, vocals), and Paul Williams (Molasses) (drums, vocals). The band moved to Melbourne the following year, with Chris Gorman replacing Williams. Alison Bolger (ex-Clag) joined the group on bass in 1998. The group released two full-length albums, &quot;Set Sail&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Deep Water&quot; in 2001, together with several EPs, for Australian indie label Chapter Music among others. The group broke up in March 2002, although they reformed six months later for a single performance to release, &quot;All These Records&quot;, a compilation album, consisting of the band&#x27;s singles and rarities. As Bolger was away overseas, bass duties were performed by Mindy Mapp (ex-Little Ugly Girls, Fur and Flesh Vs. Venom). The group reformed briefly in 2009 for two shows.

Since breaking up in 2002, all members have been active as writers and performers in other groups that either co-existed during Sleepy Township&#x27;s lifetime or were formed shortly after their demise. Blackman is a solo artist, was a member of Minimum Chips and runs the Chapter Music record label. Bolger was a member of Panel of Judges and psych-rock quintet Beaches, while Gorman and Schoen perform as part of New Estate.

<doc id="1134069" wikidata="Q469807" url="?curid=1134069" title="Eugène Maës">
<text>Eugène Maës (15 September 1890 – 30 March 1945) was a French footballer who played as a forward for Patronage Olier, Red Star, and the France national team between 1905 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, scoring 15 international goals in just 11 caps. He is widely regarded as the first great French center-forward, being nicknamed &quot;Tête d&#x27;Or&quot; for his unrivaled heading game.

==Early life==
Eugène Maës was born in Belle Époque Paris on 15 September 1890, and he began playing football in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris with his friends in 1902, aged 12.

==Career==
===Patronage Olier===
In 1905, the 15-year-old Maës joined the &quot;Patronage Olier&quot;, one of the many Catholic clubs affiliated with the FGSPF, where he already held the position of centre forward. He played a crucial role in helping Olier win the FGSPF Football Championship in 1908, beating &quot;Cadets de Bretagne&quot; 8–0 in the final held in Rennes on 26 April. This victory allowed the club to compete in the second edition of the Trophée de France in 1908, then the most prestigious Cup in France, where the 17-year-old Maës scored his side&#x27;s third and final goal in a 3–0 win over the Parisian champion of the FCAF, &quot;SM de Puteaux&quot;, in the final on 3 May. Maës helped Olier win both titles again in 1910, beating &quot;Bons Gars Bordeaux&quot; 11–0 in the FGSPF final held in Bordeaux, and beating CA Vitry 2–0 in the Trophée de France final on 29 May, with Maës scoring the opening goal in the latter.

===Red Star===

Aided by his height of 1.80 meters tall, he was particularly renowned for his heading game and surprising leap, thanks to which he scored many goals, thus earning the nickname &quot;Tête d&#x27;Or&quot; (golden head). He was also particularly known for having made a specialty of scoring goals with the &quot;goalkeeper charge&quot;, the action of jostling the goalkeeper to prevent him from having the ball, which was tolerated by the rules of the time. His goalscoring prowess eventually drew the attention of Jules Rimet&#x27;s Red Star, a newly ambitious club that had recently founded the Ligue de Football Association (LFA) and which was about to open a new stadium in Saint-Ouen, so they signed him in 1910, aged only 19, to assure goals to the team.

Maës quickly became one of the most important players of the great Red Star team of the early 1910s, which included the likes of René Fenouillère, Pierre Chayriguès, and the captain Lucien Gamblin. They were runner-ups in the LFA Football Championship in 1911, but then won it in 1912. In the subsequent &quot;Trophée de France&quot; in 1912, he lost the final to , during which Maës scored his team&#x27;s only goal in a 1–3 loss. This meant that he managed to score in each of the three finals of the &quot;Trophée de France&quot; that he had played. The club took advantage of their 1912 LFA victory to meet the greatest European teams of the time, including a narrow defeat (2–1) at home against the English professionals Tottenham in 1913. During the four seasons preceding the war, Maës scored goals in the , the highest level of the time.

==International career==
In December 1910, shortly after being transferred from the Patronage Olier to the wealthy Red Star, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI) offered the 20-year-old Maës his first selections for the French national team, making his debut in a friendly match against Hungary on 1 January 1911, and playing his second match against England in the inauguration of the Saint-Ouen stadium (currently known as Stade Bauer), both of which ending in 0–3 losses.

In his third cap on 9 April 1911, Maës scored his first goal for France, netting a brace in a 2–2 draw with Italy, each time through the &quot;goalkeeper charge&quot;, even when the latter had blocked the ball. This was the start of a 7-game goalscoring streak for France: a goal against Switzerland in Geneva (another charge on the goalkeeper) and Belgium in Brussels (rebound), and then a goal in Saint-Ouen against both Belgium (with a header) and Switzerland on 18 February 1912. After this match, he was described by the daily newspaper L&#x27;Auto (the ancestor of L&#x27;Equipe) as &quot;the best center-forward on the continent&quot;. With his 4th goal in Brussels, Maës became France&#x27;s all-time top scorer, breaking the previous record of three goals held by André François.

In the next match against Italy in Turin on 17 March 1912, Maës obtained a very late military leave, so he only arrived on site on the day of the match, at 5 A.M., but a sleepless night had not disturbed him since he managed to score a hat-trick to help France achieve its first-ever victory over the Italians (4–3). He scored his goals with a long shot, a header, and then the winner in the 66th minute, in which he &quot;snatched&quot; the ball from the hands of the Italian goalkeeper, Vittorio Faroppa, who was accused of being responsible for the defeat by the Italian newspapers, which headlined &quot;the Faroppa disaster&quot;. It took 82 years for France to defeat Italy in Italy again, doing so in 1994. He was a reserve team member at the 1912 Summer Olympics but did not appear on the field.

In the rematch against Italy in Saint-Ouen, France won again (1–0), and once again thanks to Maës, who scored the only goal of the match; his 7th straight match with a goal for France. In March against Switzerland, Maës, his former teammates Chayriguès and Alfred Gindrat, plus Maurice Bigué and Henri Bard, threatened to boycott the match if they did not get a bonus, so they were therefore temporarily sidelined and returned in April against a weak Luxembourg, against which he scored 5 goals in an 8–0 victory (including two headers), a French record that remains unbroken and that was only matched by Thadée Cisowski against Belgium in 1956. This was his last match for France; the midfielders Jean Ducret, Louis Mesnier, and Gaston Barreau were the ones who played the most with Maës.

A young prodigy of the Lost Generation, Maës was the first true goalscorer of the French national team. If not for his combat injury during the War, which obliged him to retire from professional football, Maës could certainly have been one of the best players in the history of the French national team. During his short international career of just two years, he scored 15 goals in just 11 caps, resulting in a ratio of 1.36 goals per game, which is the second-best ratio for a player with at least 5 matches for France, only behind Just Fontaine with 1.43; furthermore, neither Maës nor Fontaine took any penalty kicks. He remained the highest scorer in France&#x27;s history for nearly 17 years, from April 1911 until it was broken by Paul Nicolas in February 1928.

==Later career==
Like so many of his teammates, Maës was mobilized during the First World War, fighting in Belgium, where he was pierced by a bullet in the chest at the very beginning of the conflict, on 29 August 1914. Despite this, he kept eating and smoking as if nothing had happened, which led his coach Roland Richard to state &quot;What will I have left with such a tough lad who never quits!&quot;. While convalescing in Caen, he met his future wife, Yvonne Bertheaux. He returned to the front with the rank of corporal in April 1915, distinguished himself during the Second Battle of Artois, and received the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot;. However, 17 French internationals died during the War. During his leaves, he continued playing, and the sports press praised his military exploits. 

On his return from the battlefields, Maës still played for Red Star in the 1918–19 season. Demobilized in August 1919, he settled in Caen, where he played at the Stade Malherbe from the resumption of competitions in 1919 and until 1930, when he retired at the age of 40. During his time there, he helped the club win seven Normandy Championships, including six in a row between 1920 and 1925, and a seventh in 1928. Through his experience, he quickly established himself as the team captain, which at the time had the duty of dictating the tactics to be followed and making up the line-ups since the figure of coach as we know it today did not yet exist.

In 1933, the retired Maës received the gold medal from the French Football Federation (FFF).

==Later life==
While playing at Stade Malherbe, Maës, who was a good swimmer and practiced diving, took over the management of the Berteaux swimming school on the banks of the Orne in 1920, before replacing his father-in-law as its owner in 1924 and enventually renaming it &quot;le Lido&quot;. He modernized its infrastructure and created sporting events, such as the &quot;Traversée de Caen à la nage&quot; or the &quot;Régates de la Société nautique de Caen&quot;. In 1928, he also transformed the school into a dance hall very popular with the people of Caen. A lifeguard and then swimming instructor, Maës taught thousands of Caen residents about the pleasures of the water from 1919 to 1940.

During the Second World War, he was one of those rare sportsmen who resisted by continuing to train young Caen residents in swimming, rescue, and first aid.

==Death==
His swimming school was opposite the Château de la Motte, which was the local headquarters of the Gestapo, run by , so Maës often rubbed shoulders with Gestapo personalities on the banks of the Orne, including Heyns&#x27; mistress, Marie-Clotilde de Combiens, also known as the &quot;Black Angel of the Gestapo&quot; because she did not hesitate to denounce several people to the Nazis. No longer able to stand her attitude, Maës, who always had a &quot;strong personality&quot;, declared his feelings to her, so she denounced him to the Gestapo for anti-German and Gaullist remarks, which led to his arrest in Caen on 21 June.

Deported to the Royallieu-Compiègne internment camp on 17 September, he was then transferred to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Ellrich, where he died on 30 March 1945, at the age of 54.

==Legacy==
Throughout his life, Maës was distinguished on several occasions: he received the gold and silver medals of Physical Education, the silver medal of the Association of Swimming Teachers of France, and the gold medal of the .

A street in the city of Caen near the Stade de Venoix was named after him on 29 October 1954. Following restructuring work, the Caen nautical stadium was also named after him in May 2014.

<doc id="1134074" wikidata="Q93655" url="?curid=1134074" title="The Humans (video game)">
<text>The Humans is a puzzle-platform video game developed by Imagitec Design in Dewsbury, England and originally published by Mirage Technologies for the Amiga in May 1992. It was later ported to other home computers and consoles. The goal of the game varies per level but usually revolves around bringing at least one of the player-controlled humans to the designated end area marked by a colored tile. Doing this requires players taking advantage of the tribe&#x27;s ability to build a ladder and use tools such as spears, torches, wheels, ropes and a witch doctor in later levels.

&quot;The Humans&quot; was conceived by Rodney Humble during his time working with Imagitec Design as a project for the Atari Lynx spawning a trilogy based upon the human evolution inspired by Psygnosis″ 1991 game &quot;Lemmings&quot;, creating and drawing his ideas before transferring the design work to Imagitec programmers in developing them further, serving as the first game to be published by MicroProse offshoot Mirage, while Atari Corporation liked the title and commissioned two additional conversions for their platforms.

&quot;The Humans&quot; was very well received by video game magazines and garnered praise for the originality, presentation and audio upon its initial Amiga launch. Other versions of the game have been met with a more mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike. It was followed by three sequels: &quot;The Humans: Insult to Injury&quot; in 1992, &quot;Humans 3: Evolution - Lost in Time&quot; in 1995, and &quot;The Humans: Meet the Ancestors!&quot; in 2009.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;The Humans&quot; is a puzzle game similar to &quot;Lemmings&quot; whose objective is to manipulate the given number of humans, taking advantage of abilities and tools to achieve the level&#x27;s goal, usually consisting of finding a certain tool, killing a certain number of dinosaurs or bringing at least one human to the end point, marked by a conspicuous colored tile. Each level is independent of the next, each with its own tools, goal, and set number of humans allowed per level. The only things that carry from level to level are the total number of humans in the player&#x27;s tribe and the player&#x27;s total score.

The player controls one human at a time, and may switch between any human at any time. In order to complete a level, it is often necessary to use certain tools or abilities, such as stacking to reach a high ledge. For instance, the spear, a tool obtained in the first level of the game, may be thrown across gaps to other humans, used to jump chasms, thrown to kill dinosaurs or other enemies, or brandished to hold off dinosaurs temporarily. Certain levels also feature NPCs like the pterodactylus that can be ridden in order to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, that cannot be controlled, but can be used to the player&#x27;s advantage. Several forms of enemy appear and can range from dinosaurs that eat a human if he is unarmed and within its walking range to spear-wielding members of enemy tribes.

There can be up to eight controllable humans in a level, though some levels only allow as few as three. Though there is a preset number of humans allowed per level, there is no limit to how many humans are in the player&#x27;s tribe. If a human dies, he is replaced by one from the tribe as long as there are humans there to replace him. During the course of the game, the player is given chances to rescue other humans and add them to their tribe. If there are fewer humans in the player&#x27;s tribe than the minimum required number for any given level, the game is over. Each level, however, has a password that can be used to jump to that particular level from the beginning of the game.

== Development ==

&quot;The Humans&quot; was the creation of former Imagitec Design designer Rodney Humble during his time working at the company in Dewsbury who, inspired by Psygnosis″ &quot;Lemmings&quot; and its puzzle elements, created and drew his ideas on storyboards before transferring his work to the Imagitec programmers, developing them further into a trilogy based upon human evolution. Coding on the project started in December 1991, with &quot;Suspicious Cargo&quot; programmer David Lincoln being responsible for the Amiga version, although design work originally started on the Atari Lynx under the working titles &quot;Dino Dudes&quot; and &quot;Dino World&quot;. Atari Corporation reportedly liked the game and commissioned Imagitec with two additional conversions for their Atari Falcon and Atari Jaguar platforms respectively.

&quot;The Humans&quot;″ creation process was overseen by co-producers Martin Hooley and Simon Golding, the latter of which oversaw all versions of the game. Golding stated that the production was inspired by &quot;Lemmings&quot; instead of being &quot;a rip-off&quot; but focusing towards &quot;bigger graphics&quot;, a cartoon-esque feeling reminiscent of short films like &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, more varied levels, among other features. Lincoln employed Cross Products″ SNASM programming tool to write the code on an editor using a PC before porting it to Amiga for testing. Video game artists Andrew Gilmour and Michael Hanrahan drew the pixel art, while composers Barry Leitch and Ian Howe were responsible for the soundtrack. Other members at Imagitec were also involved in the title&#x27;s production across every subsequent version released.

== Release ==
&quot;The Humans&quot; was first launched in Europe for the Amiga in May 1992 by MicroProse offshoot Mirage Technologies, serving as their first title to be published, shortly after &quot;Lemmings&quot; was released hoping to capitalize the popularity of this style of game. GameTek and Mirage later published the PC version in June 1992 in North America and Europe. Other known commercial ports of the game include: Amiga CD32, Atari Jaguar, Atari Lynx, Atari Falcon, Game Boy, Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The Genesis version differs slightly from the other versions of this game in that the levels are in a different order than in the Amiga and PC versions. In addition, the Genesis version requires the player to choose between hearing sound effects or a music track, unlike the PC and Amiga versions, which utilize both simultaneously. A Nintendo Switch port featuring three versions of the game (SNES and Game Boy initially, with the Genesis version unlocked once you complete either of the initial games, even if using a password to start on the last level) was released by Piko Interactive and QUByte Interactive on February 3rd, 2022. The Jaguar version was included as part of the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One.

=== Cancelled ports ===
Ports of &quot;The Humans&quot; for both Game Gear and NEC PC-9801 were under development by Imagitec Design, although the latter never materialized. The Game Gear version was reviewed by &quot;Sega Pro&quot; magazine in their May 1993 issue, obtaining a 75 out of 100 score, but ultimately went unreleased for unknown reasons.

== Reception ==
The Amiga and PC versions of &quot;The Humans&quot; received excellent reviews, while those of versions ported to other consoles were more lukewarm. Ashley Cotter-Cairn, of &quot;Amiga Mania&quot;, gave the Amiga version an overall score of 93% and ranked it number 1 claiming that &quot;&quot;The Humans&quot; has everything: great graphics, including a variety of backdrops, some neat sound...(she&#x27;s) pleased to say that those long months at the keyboard were worth every second&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called the PC version of &quot;The Humans&quot; &quot;delightful&quot;. While stating that the VGA graphics&#x27; limited color palette resembled those of a console game more than a computer&#x27;s, it liked the soundtrack and documentation. The magazine concluded that while &quot;not quite the calibre of &quot;Lemmings&quot; ... In all, much pleasure is to be had&quot;.

Reviewing the Genesis version, the four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s twist on the &quot;Lemmings&quot; formula and the high level of challenge in the later levels. However, all but one of the reviewers complained that the game&#x27;s slow pace is aggravating, especially since a single mistake can force the player to restart an entire level.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said of the Jaguar version that &quot;the graphics are pretty good and the control is adequate. An OK game&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; was more critical, commenting that the backgrounds are more detailed and colorful than in the Genesis version but that the game is still graphically subpar given the Jaguar&#x27;s capabilities. They also criticized the stiff controls and lack of multiplayer modes, but still rated it as one of the better Jaguar games to date due to the &quot;brain-twisting&quot; gameplay. The Jaguar version has sold nearly 19,000 copies since its release as of 1 April 1995, though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime.

== Legacy ==
Following the success of &quot;The Humans&quot;, a sequel titled &quot;The Humans: Insult to Injury&quot; was launched in 1992 as both a stand-alone release or as an expansion pack. In 1993, the two games were combined and released for both Amiga CD32 and PC under the name &quot;Humans 1 and 2&quot;. In 1995, a third entry in the series titled &quot;Humans 3: Evolution - Lost in Time&quot; was released, keeping to the original game idea but differs from the original entry in storyline, gameplay style, and level continuity. Between 1994 and 2001, the trademarks for the Atari Jaguar version were abandoned and cancelled respectively. About a decade after GameTek declared bankruptcy, Deep Silver released a fourth entry for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS under the name &quot;The Humans: Meet the Ancestors!&quot;, retaining the same general gameplay style but improved the graphics and added more interactive objects and enemies.

<doc id="1134088" wikidata="Q28414" url="?curid=1134088" title="Lestek">
<text>Lestek (also Leszek, Lestko) was the second duke of Polans, and son of Siemowit, born c. 870–880, mentioned in the oldest Polish chronicle, &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; by Gallus Anonymus. The dukes of Polans were the foundation of the Piast dynasty, the first historical ruling dynasty of Poland.

Initially, no-one doubted the historicity of Lestek. In the second half of the nineteenth century, however, his existence began to be questioned. The issue was basically settled thanks to an article written by Henryk Łowmiański, in which he came out in favor of the credibility of Gallus Anonymus&#x27;s account, and thus in favor of the historicity of the three direct predecessors to Mieszko I. This view is dominant in the Polish historiography.

The origin of his name is not known, but it can be derived from the old Polish word &quot;lście&quot; which means &quot;crafty&quot;. It is believed this is a diminutive of the Slavic name &quot;Lścimir&quot; or &quot;Lścisław&quot;. The number and existence of Lestek&#x27;s wives or consorts are unknown. A theory by Stanisław Zakrzewski claims Lestek (or Lestko) could have been married to a Moravian princess. Another theory (inferred from the descriptions of a Belgian chronicler from the 14th century) is that a Saxon princess could have been Lestek&#x27;s wife and that they had a son, Ewraker, later the bishop of Liège. Lestko&#x27;s son, Siemomysł, was the next ruler of the Polish state.

<text>The 93rd United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1973, to January 3, 1975, during the last 18 months of Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency, and the first 6 months of Gerald Ford&#x27;s. This Congress was the first (and, to date, only) Congress with more than two Senate presidents (in this case, three). After the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Gerald Ford was appointed under the authority of the newly ratified Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Ford became president the next year and Nelson Rockefeller was appointed in his place. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1970 United States census. Both chambers had a Democratic majority.

<text>Extensible Name Service (XNS) is an open protocol for universal addressing and automated data exchange. It is an XML-based digital identity architecture.

==History==
The development of XML in 1998 led to the XNS project, and the establishment of an international non-profit governance organization, XNS Public Trust Organization (XNSORG), in early 2000. 

In 2002, the XNS specifications were contributed by XNSORG to OASIS, where they became part of the XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier) and XDI (XRI Data Interchange) Technical Committees. Together these two standards, XRI and XDI, form the basis for the formation of the Dataweb.

XNSORG has since evolved into XDI.ORG, and now offers community-based XRI/XDI infrastructure.

<text>Hell Divers is a 1932 American pre-Code black-and-white film from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starring Wallace Beery and Clark Gable as a pair of competing chief petty officers in early naval aviation. The film, made with the cooperation of the United States Navy, features considerable footage of flight operations aboard the Navy&#x27;s second aircraft carrier, the , including dramatic shots of takeoffs and landings filmed from the Curtiss F8C-4 Helldiver dive bombers after which the movie was named.

Nine months before &quot;Hell Divers&quot; was released, Gable had appeared in a supporting role in another Beery film, &quot;The Secret Six&quot;, in April 1931. For Gable, &quot;Hell Divers&quot; was not a pleasant experience since he was again billed beneath Beery, an actor he personally disliked. In 1935, Gable was billed over Beery in the lavish epic &quot;China Seas&quot;, one of only four films during the sound era in which Beery did not receive top billing. Other actors appearing include Conrad Nagel, Dorothy Jordan, Marjorie Rambeau, and Marie Prevost. An uncredited Robert Young appears near the end of the film in a speaking role as Graham, a pilot.

==Plot==
Leading Chief Petty Officer &quot;Windy&quot; Riker is a veteran aerial gunner of a Navy Helldiver dive bomber and the leading chief of Fighting Squadron One, about to go to Panama aboard the aircraft carrier. He loses his five-year title of &quot;champion machine gunner&quot; after young C.P.O. Steve Nelson joins the squadron. Windy, notorious for using his fists to enforce discipline, is charged by local police with wrecking a Turkish bath. Windy is saved from arrest, however, when Lieutenant Commander Jack Griffin, skipper of the squadron, intervenes on his behalf. Griffin and his second-in-command, Lieutenant &quot;Duke&quot; Johnson, agree that Nelson is the best candidate to replace Windy as he ponders retirement.

The chiefs engage in friendly rivalry until the squadron practices a new dive-bombing technique and Steve becomes a hero, saving the base from being accidentally bombed by climbing out on the wing of his dive bomber to hold in place a bomb that failed to release. Feelings turn bitter when Steve contradicts Windy&#x27;s explanation of the accident and Windy punches him in resentment. Windy is dressed down by Duke when the officer sees the punch. When Steve&#x27;s sweetheart, Ann Mitchell, visits him, he proposes marriage to her, but Windy uses a practical joke to get even with Steve. Unaware that Ann is Steve&#x27;s fiancée and not simply a girl he is trying to impress, Windy bribes an old acquaintance, Lulu, to pretend to be Steve&#x27;s outraged lover. Ann leaves upset and will not listen to Steve&#x27;s denials.

Griffin loses an arm following a mid-air collision at night. The accident occurs when the aircraft are returning from delivering the admiral to his flagship the &quot;Saratoga&quot; before the squadron embarks. Griffin is retired and replaced in command of Fighting One by Duke Johnson. Windy becomes Johnson&#x27;s gunner when the squadron flies to the ship. During a bombing exercise off Panama, Windy misplaces his code book and delays the takeoff of the squadron. As punishment, he is assigned to supervise a work party when the ship docks, missing liberty and keeping him from seeing Mame Kelsey (Rambeau), the woman in Panama he wants to settle down with after retirement.

Steve, who knows Mame, encounters her on the dock and shares her carriage, but Windy hears about it and sneaks into town. Mame tries to convince Steve to patch up his differences with Windy, then promotes peace between them when Windy shows up at her hotel. Having a drink together in the bar, however, Windy starts a brawl. Steve tries to help him avoid the local police but Windy is thrown in jail. As the &quot;Saratoga&quot; passes through the Panama Canal, Mame bails Windy out of jail and he catches up to it by stealing a boat. For his transgressions, the captain of the &quot;Saratoga&quot; reduces Windy one rate from chief. Windy is disciplined at &quot;Captain&#x27;s Mast&quot; and reduced to Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate 1st Class for leaving his post without authorization, absent without leave, and missing ship. Steve reluctantly becomes leading chief.

During a mock battle, Steve&#x27;s aircraft crashes near a rocky island, killing the pilot and leaving Steve with a broken leg. Duke and Windy land to rescue Steve, but Duke suffers a head injury and Windy has to save both. They have only a radio receiver and cannot be found in the fog. Steve and Windy become friends while waiting for rescue. Windy writes Ann a note confessing what he did with Lulu. After four days, Duke&#x27;s condition worsens, Steve develops blood poisoning, and they hear on the radio that the &quot;Saratoga&quot; is leaving. Windy tries to save them by flying them out in Duke&#x27;s dive bomber, with Duke in the rear cockpit and Steve riding on the wing. Despite the fog, they find the aircraft carrier, but crash on landing and Windy is fatally injured. By his last request, Windy is buried at sea as a missing man formation flies overhead.

==Cast==
==Production==

Based loosely on the earlier war epic, &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1926), &quot;Lt. Comdr. Frank Wead, U.S.N. (Ret.)&quot; is credited for the film&#x27;s story. Wead was himself later portrayed by John Wayne in John Ford&#x27;s movie biography &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot;, in which footage of &quot;Hell Divers&quot; appears. Ford regular Jack Pennick has a small role in both, appearing uncredited in &quot;Hell Divers&quot; as a recruit sailor.

Principal aerial photography under the helm of cinematographer Charles A. Marshall took place in 1931 at North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego, California. The aircraft used in the film were the Curtiss F8C-4 variant, the first production variant to bear the nickname &quot;Helldiver&quot;. A total of 25 F8C-4 aircraft were transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps shortly after the release of &quot;Hell Divers&quot;. The production received full cooperation from the US Navy Department, not only featuring the song (uncredited but considered the unofficial song of the US Navy), &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1906) (written by Charles A. Zimmerman, lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles and R. Lovell) in the opening credits but also a dedication to the naval aviators who made the film possible.

While a small number of miniatures stood in for the real aircraft, as well in a mock battle by airships attacking the &quot;Saratoga&quot;, the majority of the aerial scenes directed by Marshall, featured the actual Helldivers of VF-1B. Real events were woven into the film; footage of the historic 1928 landing of the airship USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; aboard the carrier was also incorporated into the story. In addition to sequences filmed aboard the &quot;Saratoga&quot; at sea and in the Panama Canal, &quot;Hell Divers&quot; was filmed at the NAS North Island, as one of the first of a series of naval epics filmed there.

==Release==
&quot;Hell Divers&quot; had a sneak preview in San Bernardino on October 29, 1931, but was not released until January 16, 1932.

==Reception==
&quot;Hell Divers&quot; was received well both critically and with audiences. Reviews focused on the exciting aerial sequences. Mordaunt Hall, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, effused over the &quot;magnificently photographed production, one that includes naval air stunts and impressive &#x27;landing&#x27; feats&quot;, while dismissing the plot as &quot;inconsequential&quot;. Much later reviews note the &quot;boisterous&quot; interplay between notorious scene-stealer Beery and Gable; while, for aircraft enthusiasts, the film is considered an aviation classic.

===Box-office===
According to MGM records, &quot;Hell Divers&quot; earned $1,244,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $917,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $458,000.

<text>Siemomysł or Ziemomysł (died ) was the third duke of the Polans and the father of Poland&#x27;s first Christian ruler, Mieszko I. A member of the Piast dynasty, he was listed by Gallus Anonymous in his &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; as the son of Lestek, the second known duke of the Polans. According to Gallus&#x27; account and historical research, Siemomysł has been credited with leaving the lands of the Polans, Goplans and Masovians to his son Mieszko I, who further expanded them during his reign.

==Details==
Siemomysł&#x27;s birth year and birthplace remain unknown. According to the chronicles, he was the son of a prince named Lestek who presumably ruled as Duke of Polans. In older sources, Siemomysł features under the name Ziemomysł. 

He supposedly ruled from around 930, though some historians believe that it could have been from 950. Earlier theories by Adam Naruszewicz proposed that Siemomysł&#x27;s reign could have begun as early as 913. However, this view is not accepted by contemporary historians. 

It is believed that Siemomysł united the lands of the Western Polans, the Goplans, and the Masovians. It is possible that his father, Lestek, was the first to begin this process of unification in order to establish a centralised state what would later become the Duchy of Poland in 966 AD. 

The name of Siemomysł&#x27;s wife (or wives) is also a matter of debate. There is a theory that the daughter of Włodzisław, prince of the Lendians tribe, could have been Siemomysł&#x27;s wife, but there is no historical evidence to support this. Formerly, it was thought that his wife was named Gorka, but Oswald Balzer refuted this view in 1895. Mieszko and Czcibor were his known sons. 

According to modern Polish historian Henryk Łowmiański, Siemomysł aided the Ukrani uprising against the Germans in 954 AD.

Siemomysł died sometime between 950 and 960, though the latter is more probable according to 19th-century and 20th-century sources. His burial place is unknown.

<text>David Kenneth Ritz Van Ronk (June 30, 1936 – February 10, 2002) was an American folk singer. An important figure in the American folk music revival and New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village scene in the 1960s, he was nicknamed the &quot;Mayor of MacDougal Street&quot;.

Van Ronk&#x27;s work ranged from old English ballads to blues, gospel, rock, New Orleans jazz, and swing. He was also known for performing instrumental ragtime guitar music, especially his transcription of &quot;St. Louis Tickle&quot; and Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;. Van Ronk was a widely admired avuncular figure in the Village, presiding over the coffeehouse folk culture and acting as a friend to many up-and-coming artists by inspiring, assisting, and promoting them. Folk performers he befriended include Jim and Jean, Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Patrick Sky, Phil Ochs, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, and Joni Mitchell. Dylan recorded Van Ronk&#x27;s arrangement of the traditional song &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; on his first album which The Animals would later cover and which would become a chart-topping rock single for them in 1964, helping inaugurate the folk rock movement.

Van Ronk received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in December 1997.

==Life and career==
Van Ronk was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a family that was &quot;mostly Irish, despite the Dutch &#x27;Van&#x27; name&quot;. He moved from Brooklyn to Queens around 1945 and began attending Holy Child Jesus Catholic School, whose students were mainly of Irish descent. He had been performing in a barbershop quartet since 1949, but left before finishing high school spending time in the Merchant Marine.

His first professional gigs were playing tenor banjola, a wooden bodied combination of mandola and banjo, with various traditional jazz bands around New York City, of which he later observed: &quot;We wanted to play traditional jazz in the worst way ... and we did!&quot; But the trad jazz revival had already passed its prime, and Van Ronk turned to performing the blues he had stumbled across while shopping for jazz 78s by artists like the Reverend Gary Davis, Furry Lewis and Mississippi John Hurt.

By about 1958, he was firmly committed to the folk-blues style, accompanying himself with his own acoustic guitar. He performed blues, jazz and folk music, occasionally writing his own songs but generally arranging the work of earlier artists and his folk revival peers.

He became noted both for his large physical stature and for his expansive charisma which bespoke an intellectual, cultured gentleman of diverse talents. Among his many interests were cooking, science fiction (he was active for some time in science fiction fandom, referring to it as &quot;mind rot&quot;, contributing to fanzines), world history, and politics. During the 1960s he supported radical left-wing political causes and was, at various times, a member of the Libertarian League and the Young Socialist League, at that time the youth wing of the &quot;Shachtmanite&quot; Independent Socialist League. In 1964, he was part of a group expelled from the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party which would eventually go on to become the American Committee for the Fourth International (ACFI, later renamed the Workers League). 

In 1974, he appeared at &quot;An Evening For Salvador Allende&quot;, a concert organized by Phil Ochs, alongside such other performers as his old friend Bob Dylan, to protest the overthrow of the democratic socialist government of Chile and to aid refugees from the U.S.-backed military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. After Ochs&#x27;s suicide in 1976, Van Ronk joined the many performers who played at his memorial concert in the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden, playing his bluesy version of the traditional folk ballad &quot;He Was A Friend Of Mine&quot;. Although Van Ronk was less politically active in later years, he remained committed to anarchist and socialist ideals and was a dues-paying member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) almost until his death. According to former wife and manager Terri Thal, Van Ronk &quot;insisted that he was a Trotskyist until he died.&quot;

Van Ronk was among 13 people arrested at the Stonewall Inn June 28, 1969, the night of the Stonewall Riots, which is widely credited as the spark of the contemporary gay rights movement. He had been dining at a neighboring restaurant and joined the riot against the police occupation of the club and was dragged from the crowd into the building by police deputy inspector Seymour Pine. The police slapped and punched Van Ronk to the point of near unconsciousness, handcuffed him to a radiator near the doorway, and decided to charge him for assault. Recalling the expanding riot, Van Ronk said, &quot;There were more people out there [outside the building] when I came out than when I went in. Things were still flying through the air, cacophony—I mean, just screaming and yelling, sirens, strobe lights, the whole spaghetti.&quot; The next day, he was arrested and later released on his own recognizance for having thrown a heavy object at a police officer. City records show he was charged with felony assault in the second degree and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of harassment, classified in 1969 as a violation under PL 240.25.

In 2000, he performed at Blind Willie&#x27;s in Atlanta, speaking fondly of his impending return to Greenwich Village. He reminisced over tunes like &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon&quot;, a song teasing a worn-out lover, which he ruefully remarked had seemed humorous to him back in 1962.

He continued to perform for four decades and gave his last concert just a few months before his death.

==Personal==

Van Ronk was married to Terri Thal in the 1960s, lived for many years with Joanne Grace, then married Andrea Vuocolo, with whom he spent the rest of his life.

On February 10, 2002, Van Ronk died in a New York hospital of cardiopulmonary failure while undergoing postoperative treatment for colon cancer. He died before completing work on his memoirs, which were finished by his collaborator, Elijah Wald, and published in 2005 as &quot;The Mayor Of MacDougal Street&quot;.

==Influences==
Van Ronk&#x27;s guitar work, for which he credits Tom Paley as fingerpicking teacher, is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision. Revealing similarities to Mississippi John Hurt&#x27;s, Van Ronk&#x27;s main influence was the Reverend Gary Davis, who conceived the guitar as &quot;a piano around his neck.&quot; Van Ronk took this pianistic approach and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington.

Van Ronk was among the first to adapt traditional jazz and ragtime to the solo acoustic guitar with arrangements of such ragtime staples as &quot;St. Louis Tickle&quot;, &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, &quot;The Pearls&quot; and &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;. Van Ronk brought the blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, while introducing the folk music world to the complex harmonies of Kurt Weill with his many Brecht and Weill interpretations. A traditional revivalist who moved with the times, Van Ronk brought old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell and Leonard Cohen. Dylan says of his impact:

Van Ronk gave guitar lessons in Greenwich Village, including to Christine Lavin, David Massengill, Terre Roche and Suzzy Roche. He influenced his protégé Danny Kalb and the Blues Project.

Van Ronk once said, &quot;Painting is all about space, and music is all about time.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Coen brothers film &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; follows a folk singer similar to Van Ronk, and incorporates anecdotes based on Van Ronk&#x27;s life. He is mentioned in David Bowie&#x27;s 2013 song ‘(You Will) Set the World on Fire&#x27; on &quot;The Next Day&quot; and was mentioned among the dead musicians and recording artists in the song &quot;Mirror Door&quot; by the Who in 2006 on the album &quot;Endless Wire&quot;.

In 2004, a section of Sheridan Square, where Barrow Street meets Washington Place, was renamed Dave Van Ronk Street in his memory. Van Ronk was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously by the World Folk Music Association in 2004.

Joni Mitchell said that Van Ronk&#x27;s rendition of her song &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; (which he called &quot;Clouds&quot;) was her favorite version of the song.

Van Ronk was portrayed by Joe Tippett in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

==Personal characteristics==
Van Ronk refused for many years to fly and never learned to drive (he took trains or buses or, when possible, recruited a girlfriend or young musician as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village for any extended period of time (having stayed in California for a short time in the 1960s). Van Ronk&#x27;s trademark stoneware jug of Tullamore Dew was frequently seen on stage next to him in his early days.

Critic Robert Shelton described Van Ronk as &quot;the musical mayor of MacDougal Street&quot; -

...&quot;a tall, garrulous, hairy man of three quarters, or, more accurately, three fifths Irish descent. Topped by light brownish hair and a leonine beard which he smoothed down several times a minute, he resembled an unmade bed strewn with books, record jackets, pipes, empty whiskey bottles, lines from obscure poets, finger picks, and broken guitar strings. He was [Dylan]&#x27;s first New York guru. Van Ronk was a walking museum of the blues. Through an early interest in jazz, he had gravitated toward black music—its jazz pole, its jug-band and ragtime center, its blues bedrock... His manner was rough and testy, disguising a warm, sensitive core.&quot;

<text>Ryan Cochrane (born August 8, 1983) is an American former professional soccer player.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Cochrane attended La Salle High School near Portland, Oregon and played three years of college soccer at Santa Clara University, from 2001 to 2003. In his final year, Cochrane was named a second-team All American, and was a Hermann Trophy semifinalist.

===Professional===
Following his junior season, Cochrane signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer, and entered the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected 5th overall by San Jose Earthquakes. In his first year, Cochrane finished the year with 18 starts and 1459 minutes. Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, he moved to Houston for the 2006 season.

After the 2007 season, Cochrane returned to San Jose to play for a newly formed 2008 expansion side, also named Earthquakes. Houston accommodated his request and left him exposed in the November 2007 MLS Expansion Draft where San Jose made him the first selection. He scored the deciding goal in the 90th minute for San Jose Earthquakes on August 3, 2008, against Los Angeles Galaxy in a match that would end 3-2 for San Jose.

Less than two years after leaving Houston, Cochrane was traded back to Dynamo on August 14, 2009, in exchange for an international roster slot through the 2010 season.

After the 2010 MLS season Houston declined Cochrane&#x27;s contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010, Cochrane was selected by New England Revolution in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.

Cochrane spent the 2011 season with New England. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Cochrane was not selected in the draft and became a free agent. On February 2, 2012, Cochrane signed with the expansion San Antonio Scorpions of the North American Soccer League.

After one season with San Antonio, Cochrane announced his retirement on December 28, 2012.

<text>Antonio José Colorado Laguna (born September 8, 1939) is an American lawyer and politician from New York. He served as Secretary of State of Puerto Rico and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico for the administration of Rafael Hernández Colón.

==Biography==

Colorado attended elementary and high school in Puerto Rico. In 1962, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Boston University and three years later graduated from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law with a &quot;Juris Doctor&quot;. In 1966, he earned a master of Laws from the Harvard Law School and was admitted to the Puerto Rican bar. He is a member of Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity.

From 1966 to 1968 he served as legal tax adviser to the Puerto Rico Economic Development Administration, and from 1968 to 1969 he served as the executive assistant to the economic development administrator of Puerto Rico. He began a law practice in 1969, and became a member of the Puerto Rico Tax Reform Commission Subcommittee in 1973.

In the late 1970s, in addition to his law practice, he lectured at both the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras and the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. In 1985, then Governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernández Colón, appointed Colorado to the post of administrator of economic development. From 1990 to 1992 he served as Secretary of State for Puerto Rico.

In 1992, Colorado was appointed Resident Commissioner to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Jaime B. Fuster, who was appointed associate justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. In the United States House of Representatives Colorado tried to address problems faced by Puerto Ricans, such as crime and drug abuse, and requested additional medicaid support for the Island.

He was unsuccessful in his 1992 bid for election and returned to San Juan, Puerto Rico. He currently serves as Executive Director of the Local Redevelopment Authority for the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, a facility that was abandoned by the United States Navy after naval shelling practices ended in nearby Vieques, Puerto Rico.

<text>Elmhurst University is a private university in Elmhurst, Illinois. It has a tradition of service-oriented learning and an affiliation with the United Church of Christ. The university changed its name from Elmhurst College on July 1, 2020.

== History ==

=== From proseminary to university ===
In 1871, Jennie and Thomas Barbour Bryan gave land in Elmhurst to the German Evangelical Synod of the Northwest. This land was given for the purpose of establishing a school to prepare young men for the theological seminary and to train teachers for parochial schools, and was named the Elmhurst Proseminary. The first students, who were all male, studied Latin, Greek, English, German, music, history, geography, mathematics, science, and religion. All classes were taught in German. It wasn&#x27;t until 1917 that the catalog was published in English. In 1919, the name was changed to the Elmhurst Academy and Junior College, and the expanded curriculum included courses in public speaking, physical education, economics, psychology, and the history of education. In 1924, the school was renamed Elmhurst College and became a four-year college for men. The college seal was designed in the 1920s by Robert Leonhardt, first registrar of the college, who also served as coach of the football team. Women first enrolled in 1930, and four years later, the college was accredited. The college began its graduate programs in 1998, and in 2012 the School for Professional Studies (SPS) was established to offer a wide range of online programs, including undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees and certificate programs. On June 15, 2019, the Elmhurst College Board of Trustees approved a name change to Elmhurst University, which took place July 1, 2020.
The campus is in Elmhurst, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. It is a certified Level 2 Arboretum and a member of Tree Campus USA, with more than 950 different species from around the globe.

=== Academic buildings and facilities ===
* The Frick Center houses lounges, a dining hall, E.C. Grille, Frick Center Café, the Game Room, the Spirit Shop (where university apparel and memorabilia is sold), the Central Printing and Mail Room, conference rooms, the university radio station WRSE-FM (88.7mHz) as well as The Niebuhr Center for Engagement and Reflection, whose stated mission is to provide engaging experiences and meaningful reflection for the community to cultivate a sense of purpose in life. The offices of the Student Government Association, Union Board, the Elms Yearbook, Student Affairs and Student Activities are also in the Frick Center. Built in 1964 and formerly known as the College Union Building, it was renamed in 1994 to honor the university&#x27;s eleventh president, Dr. Ivan E. Frick and his wife Ruth Hudson Frick. The Frick Center also houses the Blume Board Room, named in honor of former board of trustees member and graduate Allen C. Blume (1955) and his wife Phyllis, as well as the Brune Patio, named in honor of graduate and benefactor Joan Brune (1951) as a gift to the university from her husband, graduate and benefactor Lester H. Brune (1948).
* The Barbara A. Kieft Accelerator ArtSpace houses a 750,000-volt Cockcroft-Walton particle accelerator. Originally built by Dr. Sam Allison, professor of physics at University of Chicago, it was moved to Elmhurst in the late 1960s and became operational in 1973. The accelerator was deactivated when the building began its new life as an art exhibition space in 2004.
* The A.C. Buehler Library, named in honor of the former president of the Victor Comptometer Corporation and board of trustees member, is home to over 237,000 volumes and a highly regarded collection of Chicago Imagists art. It opened in 1971 and was renovated in 1993 and again in 2002, due to a donation from the estate of graduate Gladys (1940) and Ray Robinson. The library now has almost a hundred computers for general use and thousands of audio-visual materials. The library is also home for the Learning Center (tutoring and study skills assistance for students), the Center for Professional Excellence, which provides career guidance, resume assistance, internships, networking, mentoring and job shadowing opportunities for all students, as well as the Rudolf G. Schade Archives and Special Collections and the Honors Program student lounge.
* Daniels Hall, renamed in 2008 in honor of former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and current Elmhurst University faculty member Lee A. Daniels, is home to the computer laboratories, the departments of Mathematics, Computer Science and Information Systems, World Languages, Literatures &amp; Cultures, Intercultural Studies, and Geography and Geosciences. It opened in 1988 as the Computer Science and Technology Center. Daniels Hall is also home to the Graduate Admission office, as well as general classrooms, the Gretsch Recording Studio.
* Constructed in 1911 as a dormitory and named for the fourth president, Daniel Irion, Irion Hall now houses the Music department. The building&#x27;s 120-seat Buik Recital Hall (named in honor of The Buik family, including former board of trustees member Donald W. Buik and his wife Betty, as well as the John J. Roche family) is used for concerts, recitals and lectures. Buik was renovated in 2013 due to a donation from graduate and benefactor Lori Julian (2008). Irion Hall housed the college&#x27;s first official library from 1912 to 1922. The building was fully renovated in 1979 and has its own recording studio as well as a choir room, rehearsal hall, percussion room, listening room, two music classrooms, extensive music libraries and individual practice rooms.
* Kranz Forum is the site of a statue of Reinhold Niebuhr, a preeminent 20th-century theologian and 1910 graduate of the Elmhurst Proseminary, and the former site of Kranz Hall, constructed in 1873 and the first building on campus. The Niebuhr statue was sculpted by Robert Berks and has Niebuhr&#x27;s Serenity Prayer etched on it in two places. Kranz Hall was razed in 1981, and Kranz Forum dedicated in 1982. The plaque noting the location of Kranz Hall is mounted on a base built with stone blocks salvaged from the original building.
* Memorial Hall houses the Deicke Center for Nursing Education. Formerly Memorial Library, the building was named in honor of the 900 young men of the Evangelical Synod who lost their lives in World War I. The original dedication plaques for those lost are still located in the main lobby, which remains as it was when the building opened in 1922. Memorial Library was renovated for its current use and renamed Memorial Hall when Buehler Library opened in 1971. In 2014, the Nursing Simulation Laboratory moved out of Memorial Hall and into its new facility at Elmhurst Memorial Hospital in a collaboration between the two institutions.
* Built in 1878 as a dormitory, Old Main (also known as Hauptgebaude) is the oldest building on campus. It houses the departments of Art, Urban Studies, History, Religious Studies, Sociology &amp; Criminal Justice, and Political Science, as well as art studios (including individual spaces for student artists) and general classrooms. Old Main is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was renovated in 1920 after a major fire, and again in 1976 and 1995. At one time or another, Old Main housed the science labs, the college cafeteria, a pipe organ, and a Fumatorium (smoking room) where students in the early 1900s smoked, talked and played chess. Along with Irion Hall, Old Main even served as the university library (in an unofficial capacity) before Memorial Library was built.
* Mill Theater was acquired by the university in the early 1960s. Before becoming the primary theatrical space for the college, the single story building functioned as the molding mill for the Hammerschmidt lumber operations. (Legend has it that David Payne, Theater Technical Director who died in an accident in 1968, haunts the theater and Scene Shop.) The theater itself is a thrust space with seating for 180. With the donations from alumni, improvements were made in 2010 which included a new lighting system, sound system, ventilation, and stage. The summer of 2012 saw a renovation of the lobby, doubling its size, and included the addition of a new box office, public restrooms and renovated theater seating, due to alumna Meredith Wallenberg Morrison&#x27;s (1972) donation through The Wollenberg Foundation. A &quot;black box&quot; style theater like those found in many cities and towns, Mill Theater gives students hands-on experience with all aspects of theater operations, including the opportunity to direct as well as have their own original stage plays workshopped and possibly premiered.
* The Science Center, dedicated in 1966 and renamed the Arthur J. Schaible Science Center in 1994 in honor of an accomplished graduate (1929) and benefactor, houses the Biology, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Psychology, and Physics departments, as well as general classrooms and 120-seat lecture room Illinois Hall. It also houses the Bates Observatory, which has a 14&quot; computer-controlled Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope and is named in honor of benefactors Alben F. Bates, an Elmhurst attorney, and board of trustees member Joy P. Rasin. Renovation was completed on the physics labs in 2014, the two main biology labs were renovated in 2015, and in 2016, two chemistry labs were renovated.
* Goebel Hall, which opened in 1928 as the university gymnasium, was renovated in 1978 and again in 1989, when it was converted into an administration building and renamed in honor of the university&#x27;s third president, Peter Goebel. Offices for Academic Affairs, Advising, Student Financial Services, and Registration and Records can be found there. The lower-level houses the Football locker rooms and offices. 
* The Physical Education Center opened in 1983, and was renamed R.A. Faganel Hall in 2000 in honor of graduate Robert A. Faganel (1952). Faganel Hall houses the Kinesiology Department, athletic coaching offices, two basketball courts (competition and practice), two racquetball courts, a dance studio, training rooms, equipment rooms and team locker rooms. The Tyrrell Fitness Center was added on the west side of the building in 2001 and provides weight training and physical fitness facilities for students, faculty and staff. The center is named in honor of former board of trustees chairperson and graduate Tom Tyrrell (1967) and his wife Diane Tyrrell, who donated the funds for its construction. 
* Hammerschmidt Memorial Chapel, dedicated in 1959 and named in honor of benefactor Louis Hammerschmidt and family, serves as both a place of worship and for public lectures, musical events and other assemblies. The building served as a temporary library in 1993 when the A.C. Buehler library was being renovated, then underwent its own renovation and reopened 1994. It houses the English and Philosophy departments as well as general classrooms. The chapel has two pipe organs, a Moller Opus on the stage in the main auditorium and a smaller pipe organ in the Prayer Chapel. The main auditorium seats about 1,000.
* Lehmann Hall opened in 1951 as a senior men&#x27;s dormitory, and is named after the university&#x27;s seventh president, Timothy Lehmann. In 1982, it was remodeled and houses the Office of the President as well as Communication and Public Affairs, Development and Alumni Relations, Office of Campus Security, and academic departments Communication Arts and Sciences, Economics, and Business.
* Jean Koplin Memorial Hall (formerly Circle Hall, dedicated in 2004) houses the Admission Office, as well as the Speech Clinic, the Communication Sciences &amp; Disorders department, the Education department, and general classrooms. 
* The Lester Brune Tennis Courts, built in 2003, are named in honor of graduate and benefactor Lester H. Brune (1948) as a gift to the university from his wife, graduate and benefactor Joan Brune (1951).

=== Social justice history ===
In 1943–44, Elmhurst University admitted four new students from California—American citizens of Japanese descent, or Nisei—at a time when more than 110,000 people of Japanese descent had been sent to 10 government &quot;relocation centers&quot; in desolate regions of the American West. Elmhurst was one of a number of colleges and universities that attempted to right the wrong of the relocation camps by opening its doors to Japanese-American students during World War II. (The U.S. government agreed that the Nisei could enroll in participating schools, provided that they passed an FBI background check.) The Student Refugee Committee, a new campus organization, and President Timothy Lehmann paved the way for the students to enroll—over the vocal opposition of a small group of local residents, including members of the American Legion. The &quot;Elmhurst Press&quot; ran a front-page editorial with the headline, &quot;No Room For Jap Students in this Town&quot;. However, support for the Nisei on campus was &quot;practically 100 percent&quot;, President Lehmann noted at the time.

In the summer of 1966, the university brought Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the podium of Hammerschmidt Memorial Chapel during Dr. King&#x27;s historic, yearlong effort to racially desegregate city and suburban neighborhoods in the Chicago area. The university later established an annual Martin Luther King Jr. Guestship, which examines issues and ideas related to Dr. King&#x27;s work.

The university has fourteen Social Action and Service Groups for students to join, among them Habitat for Humanity, Best Buddies, Active Minds, the Global Poverty Club, Relay For Life, Autism Speaks, Students Assisting Animal Shelters, the Greenjays (sustainability club), Alpha Phi Omega and others.

In 2011, the university decided to include an optional question about prospective students’ sexual orientation and gender identity in its admission application in order to better serve all Elmhurst University students.

==Academics==
Elmhurst University offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees.

==Student life==
===Athletics===
Elmhurst athletic teams are the Bluejays. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) for most of their sports since the 1967–68 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1946–47 to 1959–60, while in women&#x27;s bowling, a sport with a single NCAA championship open to members of all three NCAA divisions, the school had been a member of the Division II Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association until after the 2018–19 season, but has since become a charter member of the Central Intercollegiate Bowling Conference (CIBC), a new Division III bowling league. The Bluejays previously competed in the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) from 1925–26 to 1940–41. Their previous nickname was the Pirates.

Fraternities and sororities do not have houses on or off campus. There are also 23 honor and recognition societies.

===Traditions===
The hash bell is a large hand bell rung at Elmhurst ceremonies as a reminder of the long history of the institution. This is the bell that kept the school on schedule in its early years, and generations of alumni have recalled fondly the loud clanging that woke students in the morning, assembled them for classes and activities, and then called them from their chores to dinner in the evening. One of the earliest Elmhurst catalogs declares: &quot;Life in the institution is regulated entirely by the stroke of the bell.&quot; Why it came to be called &quot;the hash bell&quot; remains a mystery.

The Victory Bell is a large bell located in the corner of Langhorst Field which is rung by every member of the football team after every home victory. The bell was originally located in the Old Main bell tower and moved to Langhorst Field in a new stone tower as a gift from the class of 1964.

A wood stage in the game room (located in the Bluejays&#x27; Roost in the lower level of the Frick Center) is where occasional open mic sessions for students are held, including poetry slams, improv comedy, literary readings, and musical performances, some of which are sometimes impromptu.

The Elmhurst University Jazz Festival is one of the oldest jazz festivals in the nation. It has brought hundreds of high school and college jazz bands from throughout the country and dozens of notable judges and performers such as Dizzy Gillespie, Doc Severinsen, Bobby Shew, Dee Dee Bridgewater, the Count Basie Orchestra, Maynard Ferguson, Clark Terry, Cannonball Adderley, Diane Schuur, Marian McPartland, Frank Mantooth and many others to the stage at Hammerschmidt Chapel.

Student, faculty and staff signatures and dates can be seen inside the clock tower in Old Main, some dating back to the founding years of the university&#x27;s history. It has remained a rare occasion when students are allowed access, and it is a coveted prize to be able to add your own name.

The university was given the original nativity scene from the movie &quot;Home Alone&quot;, which is displayed each year during the holiday season.

<text>The Norbert O. Schedler Honors College is an interdisciplinary program at the University of Central Arkansas. One of the first Honors Colleges (in contrast to numerous honors programs) in the country, the Schedler Honors College leads to the receipt of a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies. Successful completion of the minor requires a senior thesis or a supplemental senior project such as a performance, exhibit, or other creative work.

==History==
The college was founded in 1982 by professor of philosophy Dr. Norbert Schedler and was one of the first Honors Colleges in the United States. The first class in the spring of 1982 was composed of 60 students with an average ACT score of 26.8 and a very tight budget.
==Graduation requirements==
The Interdisciplinary Studies Minor is satisfied by the completion of a two-tiered system of courses. The first tier of Honors courses makes up the Honors Program. These four courses are considered the core classes and the credit from these classes is applied to the students&#x27; general education requirements.

The typical sequence of class in the first tier is
*Honors Core I
*Honors Core II
*Honors Core III
*Honors Core IV

During a student&#x27;s year, the student must complete a sophomore lecture on a subject of their choice and meet certain GPA requirements in order to continue into the Honors college, the second tier of Honors course work. The 15 credit hours in the second tier satisfy the requirements for an Interdisciplinary Studies Minor. In satisfying the minor requirements, students develop their own curriculum by selecting from a variety of course offerings.

For completion of the minor the minimum the student must complete:
*2 Junior Seminars
*1 Senior Seminar
*1 Oxford Tutorial
*1 Honors Thesis
Upper level seminar courses are offered in subjects such as religion, gender studies, constitutional law, ecology, storytelling, the history of science and technology, and social movements.

==Co-curricular activities==
The Schedler Honors College offers a number of activities that supplement their standard course load they call these co-curricular events. These include Hightables, a series of lectures given by visiting academics; Soapboxes, a series of discussion groups led by Honors students or faculty; a weekly meditation group; and a Foreign Film Series. These events are usually an hour to two hours in length and happen regularly throughout the semester.

The Schedler Honors College also hosts two special events on a bi-annual basis. The first of these is called Issues in the Public Square. It is a weeklong series of lectures and discussion groups concentrating on a single theme. Events are led by students, faculty, and visiting academics. The second of these special events is called Challenge Week; this event falls on alternating years from Issues in the Public Square. Historically Challenge Week was a weeklong event but in recent years it has been expanded to two weeks to accommodate the increased number of speakers that are invited. Each Challenge Week concentrates on a theme, recent topics include ecology, intelligent design, and the cultural conflict in America. A number of guest speakers are invited for each Challenge Week, these lecturers are expert in their field and are the core of the events schedule. Hightables, Soapboxes, and roundtable discussions on related topics supplement these speakers. Past guest lecturers have included George McGovern, Ralph Nader, Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, Manning Marable, Neil Gaiman, Chuck Klosterman and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

<doc id="1134140" wikidata="Q257335" url="?curid=1134140" title="Darlene Conley">
<text>Darlene Conley (July 18, 1934 – January 14, 2007) was an American actress. Conley&#x27;s career spanned fifty years, but she was best known for her performances in daytime television, and in particular, for her portrayal of larger-than-life fashion industrialist Sally Spectra on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Conley played the role from 1989 until her death eighteen years later. Darlene&#x27;s character Sally is the only soap opera character to be displayed at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s wax figures galleries in Amsterdam and Las Vegas.

== Life and career ==
Conley, an Irish American, was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Melba (née Manthey) and Raymond Conley. She began her acting career at age 15 when she was cast in the touring production of the Broadway play &quot;The Heiress&quot;. After graduating from high school, she appeared in several stage productions, including &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;Night of the Iguana&quot;. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Conley was employed with the traveling theater group the Chicago Uptown Circuit Players and Playwrights Company and on Broadway with the Helen Hayes Repertory Theater. 

In 1963, Conley landed a bit part in the movie &quot;The Birds&quot;, which was followed by similar small roles in movies like &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;. On television, Conley appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and guest-starred on prime time shows including &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. She also appeared in the first episode of the fifth season of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; as a prison warden. Conley appeared on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in 1981, in the episode entitled &quot;A Wiser Heart.&quot;

=== Daytime television ===
Conley&#x27;s performance as Rose DeVille on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; followed, with Conley playing many small roles on other soaps for most of the 1980s. She was the tough but basically decent prison warden Edith Hopkins on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1983 during Liz Chandler&#x27;s incarceration for Marie Horton&#x27;s shooting. As Trixie on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1984 to 1988, she was an old hooker pal of Ruby&#x27;s who worked at Kelly&#x27;s. Her role as Rose De Ville on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; inspired William J. Bell to cast her as flamboyant fashion maven Sally Spectra on his newer serial, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. She earned two Outstanding Supporting Actress Daytime Emmy and six Soap Opera Digest Awards nominations for her role.

She was friends with several actors who appeared on &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, including Fabio, who has appeared on the show several times, usually under the guise of celebrating Sally&#x27;s birthday. She was also friends with Phyllis Diller, who also appeared on the show as Sally&#x27;s friend, Gladys Pope.

=== Illness and death ===
Conley became ill in 2004 due to a fall that broke several bones. She recovered from the fall and returned to work (although she was usually seated during her scenes). Reports surfaced in the media in the fall of 2006 that Conley had surgery and received treatment for stomach cancer. Conley died on January 14, 2007. &quot;B&amp;B&quot; featured a tribute to Conley; John McCook presented the tribute, which featured her memorable moments on the show.

Sally Spectra is still a character on &quot;B&amp;B&quot;. Sally&#x27;s absence has been explained by having her son CJ tell his father, Clarke (and viewers), that Sally had taken a permanent vacation in St. Tropez. Head writer Brad Bell said that Sally is &quot;bigger than life&quot; and will live on forever. 

In late 2007, Sally decided to sell her fashion house. Nick Marone and Jackie Marone bought Spectra and ran the company; in a later story in 2017, the show revisited many of the storylines of Sally Spectra to introduce a new younger character, also named Sally, who is the niece of the original Sally Spectra. The younger Spectra relaunched the house of Spectra fashion line. In addition, the show brought back the character of CJ to appear in several episodes.

<doc id="1134142" wikidata="Q5869268" url="?curid=1134142" title="History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">
<text>The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was generally perceived as covering that of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party from which it evolved. In 1912, the party formally split, and the predecessor to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union became a distinct entity. Its history since then can roughly be divided into the following periods:
* the early years of the Bolshevik Party in secrecy and exile
* the period of the October Revolution of 1917
* consolidation of the party as the governing force of the Soviet Union
* the Great Purge of the 1930s
* the Khrushchev and Brezhnev periods (1956–1982)
* the Gorbachev era of reform (1985–1991), which eventually led to the break-up of the party in 1991. The history of the regional and republican branches of the party does however differ from the all-Russian and all-Union party on several points.

== Nomenclature ==
With its lineal predecessors and soi-disant heirs, the party used various names in succession:
* 1898 – 1912: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party – RSDLP ()
* 1912 – 8 March 1918: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) ()
* 8 March 1918 – 31 December 1925: Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) ()
* 31 December 1925 – 14 October 1952: All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) ()
* 14 October 1952 – 6 November 1991: Communist Party of the Soviet Union ()
* 6 November 1991–: various, including Communist Party of the Russian Federation ()

== Formation of RSDLP(b) ==

In January 1912, the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP convened a 6th All-Russian Party Conference in Prague, in the absence of their Menshevik adversaries. Over twenty Party organizations were represented. In the eyes of the Bolsheviks the conference had, therefore, the significance of a regular Party congress.

In the statement of the conference which announced that the shattered central apparatus of the Party had been restored and a new Central Committee set up is the following statement: &quot;Not only have the banner of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, its program and its revolutionary traditions survived, but so has its organization, which persecution may have undermined and weakened, but could never utterly destroy.&quot; Moreover, the conference declared the Mensheviks expelled from the party. Thus the RSDLP effectively split, with the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks constituting separate political parties (Both groups would continue to use the name &quot;RSDLP&quot;. The Bolshevik party added &quot;bolshevik&quot; to their name to differentiate themselves from the Mensheviks.)

In its resolution on the reports presented by the local organizations, the conference noted that &quot;energetic work is being conducted everywhere among the Social-Democratic workers with the object of strengthening the local illegal Social-Democratic organizations and groups&quot;. The conference noted that the most important rule of Bolshevik tactics in periods of retreat - to combine illegal work with legal work within the various legally existing workers&#x27; societies and unions - was being observed in all the localities.

The Prague Conference elected a Bolshevik Central Committee of the Party, consisting of:

* Vladimir Lenin
* Joseph Stalin
* Sergo Ordzhonikidze
* Yakov Sverdlov
* Suren Spandaryan
* Filipp Goloshchyokin
* Others

Stalin and Sverdlov won election to the Central Committee despite their non-attendance at the conference, as they were in exile at the time. The elected alternate members of the Central Committee included Mikhail Kalinin.

For the direction of revolutionary work in Russia a practical center (the Russian Bureau of the C.C.) was set up, with Stalin at its head and including Y. Sverdlov, Spandaryan, S. Ordzhonikidze, M. Kalinin and Goloshchekin.

Writing to Maxim Gorky at the beginning of 1912, on the results of the Prague Conference, Lenin said:

At last we have succeeded, in spite of the Liquidator scum, in restoring the Party and its Central Committee. I hope you will rejoice with us over the fact.

Speaking of the significance of the Prague Conference, Stalin said:

This conference was of the utmost importance in the history of our Party, for it drew a boundary line between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks and amalgamated the Bolshevik organizations all over the country into a united Bolshevik Party.

In the summer of 1912, Lenin moved from Paris to Galicia in order to be nearer to Russia, and there he presided over two conferences of members of the Central Committee and leading Party workers, one of which took place in Kraków at the end of 1912, and the other in Poronino, a small town near Kraków, in the autumn of 1913. These conferences adopted decisions on questions relating to the working-class movement including the rise in the revolutionary movement, the Party tasks in connection with the strikes, the strengthening of the illegal organizations, the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, the Party press, and the labor insurance campaign.

== Emergence of &quot;Pravda&quot; ==

An important instrument used by the Bolshevik Party to strengthen its organizations and to spread its influence among the masses was the Bolshevik daily newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; (Truth), published in St. Petersburg. It was founded, according to Lenin&#x27;s instructions, on the initiative of Stalin, Olminsky and Poletayev. Pravda was intended as a legal, mass working-class paper founded simultaneously with the new rise of the revolutionary movement. Its first issue appeared on .

Previous to the appearance of Pravda, the Bolsheviks already had a weekly newspaper called &quot;Zvezda&quot;, intended for advanced workers. Zvezda had played an important part at the time of the Lena events. It printed a number of political articles by Lenin and Stalin. But the Party felt that with the revolutionary upsurge, a weekly newspaper no longer met the requirements of the Bolshevik Party. According to the analysis of the Party leadership, a daily mass political newspaper designed for the broadest sections of the workers was needed. Thus &quot;Pravda&quot; was founded.

The tsarist government suppressed Pravda eight times in the space of two and a half years; but each time, with the support of the workers, it reappeared under a new but similar name, e.g., &quot;Za Pravdu&quot; (For Truth), &quot;Put Pravdy&quot; (Path of Truth), &quot;Trudovaya Pravda&quot; (Labour Truth), etc..

Whilst the average circulation of Pravda was 40,000 copies per day, the circulation of &quot;Luch&quot; (&quot;Ray&quot;), the Menshevik daily, did not exceed 15,000 or 16,000.

In Moscow, the party launched &quot;Nash Put&quot; as a workers newspaper in September 1913. It was banned after just a few editions were published.

== Work in the Duma ==
Another legally functioning central organ of the Party was the Bolshevik group in the Fourth State Duma. In 1912 the government decreed elections to the Fourth Duma. The RSDLP(b) decided to participate in the elections. The RSDLP(b) acted independently, under its own slogans, in the Duma elections, simultaneously attacking both the government parties and the liberal bourgeoisie (Constitutional-Democrats). The slogans of the Bolsheviks in the election campaign were a democratic republic, an 8-hour day and the confiscation of the landed estates.

The elections to the Fourth Duma were held in the autumn of 1912. At the beginning of October, the government, dissatisfied with the course of the elections in St. Petersburg, tried to encroach on the electoral rights of the workers in a number of the large factories. In reply, the St. Petersburg Committee of the RSDLP(b), on Stalin&#x27;s proposal, called upon the workers of the large factories to declare a one-day strike.

Placed in a difficult position, the government was forced to yield, and the workers were able at their meetings to elect whom they wanted. The vast majority of the workers voted for the &#x27;Mandate (Nakaz) of the Workingmen of St. Petersburg to Their Labour Deputy&#x27; to their delegates and the deputy, which had been drawn up by Stalin. The Mandate declared that the future actions of the people should take the form of a struggle on two fronts—against the tsarist government and against the liberal bourgeoisie. In the end, RSDLP(b) candidate Badayev was elected to the Duma by the workers of St. Petersburg.

The workers voted in the elections to the Duma separately from other sections of the population (this was known as the worker curia). Of the nine deputies elected from the worker curia, six were members of the RSDLP(b): Badayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, Samoilov, Shagov and Malinovsky (the latter subsequently turned out to be an agentprovocateur). The Bolshevik deputies were elected from the big industrial centres, in which not less than four-fifths of the working class were concentrated. After the election, the RSDLP(b) formed a joint Social-Democratic Duma group together with the Mensheviks (who had seven seats). In October 1913, after a series of controversies with the Mensheviks, the RSDLP(b) Duma members, on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, withdrew from the joint Social-Democratic group and formed an independent Bolshevik Duma group.

In the Duma, the Bolsheviks introduced a bill providing for an 8-hour working day. It was voted down, but had a significant agitational value for the Bolsheviks.

== Outbreak of World War I ==
In July 1914 the Tsarist government called for general mobilization. Russia entered into war with the German Empire. The First World War had begun.

The RSDLP(b) denounced the war as imperialist. Moreover, the party denounced the European Social Democratic parties, who supported the war efforts of their respective countries, as &#x27;social-chauvinists&#x27;. From the very outbreak of the war Lenin began to muster forces for the creation of a new International, the Third International. In the manifesto against the war it issued in November 1914, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party already called for the formation of the Third International in place of the Second International.

In February 1915, a conference of Socialists of the Entente countries was held in London. The RSDLP(b) delegate Maxim Litvinov, on Lenin&#x27;s instructions, spoke at this conference demanding that the Socialists should resign from the national governments of Belgium and France, completely break with the imperialists and refuse to collaborate with them. He demanded that all Socialists should wage a determined struggle against their imperialist governments and condemn the voting of war credits. But no voice in support of Litvinov was raised at this conference.

At the beginning of September 1915 the first conference of internationalists was held in Zimmerwald. Lenin called this conference the &#x27;first step&#x27; in the development of an international movement against the war. At this conference Lenin formed the Zimmerwald Left group. But Lenin felt that within the Zimmerwald Left group only the RSDLP(b) had taken a correct and thoroughly consistent stand against the war.

The Zimmerwald Left group published a magazine in German called the &quot;Vorbote&quot; (Herald), to which Lenin contributed articles. In 1916 the internationalists succeeded in convening a second conference in the Swiss village of Kienthal. It is known as the Second Zimmerwald Conference. By this time groups of internationalists had been formed in nearly every European country and the cleavage between the internationalist elements and the &#x27;social-chauvinists&#x27; had become more sharply defined.

The manifesto drawn up by the Kienthal Conference was the result of an agreement between various conflicting groups; it was an advance on the Zimmerwald Manifesto. But like the Zimmerwald Conference, the Kienthal Conference did not accept the basic principles of the Bolshevik policy, namely, the conversion of the imperialist war into a civil war, the defeat of one&#x27;s own imperialist government in the war, and the formation of the Third International. Nevertheless, the Kienthal Conference helped to crystallize the internationalist elements of whom the Communist Third International was subsequently formed.

At the beginning of the war, in spite of persecution by the police, the Bolshevik members of the Duma– Badayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, Samoilov and Shagov– visited a number of organizations and addressed them on the policy of the Bolsheviks towards the war and revolution. In November 1914 a conference of the Bolshevik group in the State Duma was convened to discuss policy towards the war. On the third day of the conference all present were arrested. The court sentenced the Bolshevik members of the State Duma to forfeiture of civil rights and banishment to Eastern Siberia. The tsarist government charged them with high treason.

At this point Lev Kamenev deviated from the party line. He declared in the court that he did not agree with the party on the question of the war, and to prove this he requested that the Menshevik Jordansky be summoned as witness.

The Bolsheviks campaigned against the War Industry Committees set up to serve the needs of war, and advocated boycott of the elections of &#x27;Workers Groups&#x27; of the committee.

The Bolsheviks also developed extensive activities in the army and navy. The party formed nuclei in the army and navy, at the front and in the rear, and distributed leaflets calling for a fight against the war. In Kronstadt, the Bolsheviks formed a &#x27;Central Collective of the Kronstadt Military Organization&#x27; which had close connections with the Petrograd Committee of the Party. A military organization of the Petrograd Party Committee was set up for work among the garrison.

In August 1916, the chief of the Petrograd Okhrana reported that &#x27;in the Kronstadt Collective, things are very well organized, conspiratorially, and its members are all taciturn and cautious people. This Collective also has representatives on shore.&#x27;

At the front, the party agitated for fraternization between the soldiers of the warring armies, claiming that the world bourgeoisie was the enemy, and that the war could be ended only by converting the imperialist war into a civil war and turning one&#x27;s weapons against one&#x27;s own bourgeoisie and its government. Cases of refusal of army units to take the offensive became more and more frequent. There were already such instances in 1915, and even more in 1916.

Particularly extensive were the activities of the Bolsheviks in the armies on the Northern Front, in the Baltic provinces. At the beginning of 1917 General Nikolai Ruzsky, Commander of the Army on the Northern Front, informed Headquarters that the Bolsheviks had developed intense revolutionary activities on that front.

== Bolsheviks during the 1917 Revolutions ==
=== February Revolution ===

The year 1917 was inaugurated by the strike of . In the course of this strike demonstrations were held in Petrograd, Moscow, Baku and Nizhni Novgorod. In Moscow about one-third of the workers took part in the strike of January 22. A demonstration of two thousand persons on Tverskoi Boulevard was dispersed by mounted police. A demonstration on the Vyborg Chaussée in Petrograd was joined by soldiers. &quot;The idea of a general strike,&quot; the Petrograd police reported, &quot;is daily gaining new followers and is becoming as popular as it was in 1905.&quot;

On , a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in Petrograd. On the workers of most of the big factories were on strike. On International Women&#x27;s Day, , at the call of the Petrograd Bolshevik Committee, working women came out in the streets to demonstrate against starvation, war and tsardom. The Petrograd workers supported the demonstration of the working women by a citywide strike movement. The political strike began to grow into a general political demonstration against the tsarist system.

On the demonstration was resumed with even greater vigour. About 200,000 workers were already on strike. On large sections of working-class Petrograd had joined the revolutionary movement. The political strikes in the districts merged into a general political strike of the whole city. Demonstrations and clashes with the police took place everywhere. Slogans were raised like &quot;Down with the tsar!&quot;, &quot;Down with the war!&quot;, &quot;We want bread!&quot;

On the morning of the political strike and demonstration began to assume the character of an uprising. The workers disarmed police and gendarmes and armed themselves. Nevertheless, the clashes with the police ended with the shooting down of a demonstration on Znamenskaya Square. General Sergey Semyonovich Khabalov, Commander of the Petrograd Military District, announced that the workers must return to work by , otherwise they would be sent to the front. On the tsar gave orders to General Khabalov: &quot;I command
you to put a stop to the disorders in the capital not later than tomorrow.&quot; But &quot;to put a stop&quot; to the revolution was no longer possible.

On the 4th Company of the Reserve Battalion of the Pavlovsky Regiment opened fire, not on the workers, however, but on squads of mounted police who were engaged in a skirmish with the workers. A most energetic and persistent drive was made to win over the troops, especially by the working women, who addressed themselves directly to the soldiers, fraternized with them and called upon them to help the people to overthrow the tsarist autocracy. The practical work of the Bolshevik Party at that time was directed by the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party which had its quarters in Petrograd and was headed by Vyacheslav Molotov. On February 26 (March 11) the Bureau of the Central Committee issued a manifesto calling for the continuation of the armed struggle against tsardom and the formation of a Provisional Revolutionary Government.

On the troops in Petrograd refused to fire on the workers and began to line up with the people in revolt. The number of soldiers who had joined the revolt by the morning of March 12 was still no more than 10,000, but by the evening it already exceeded 60,000.

The workers and soldiers who had risen in revolt began to arrest tsarist ministers and generals and to free revolutionaries from jail. The released political prisoners joined the revolutionary struggle. In the streets, shots were still being exchanged with police and gendarmes posted with machine guns in the attics of houses. But the troops rapidly went over to the side of the workers, and this decided the fate of the Tsarist autocracy. When the news of the victory of the revolution in Petrograd spread to other towns and to the front, the workers and soldiers everywhere began to depose the tsarist officials.

On , the liberal members of the Fourth State Duma, as the result of a backstairs agreement with the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders, set up a Provisional Committee of the State Duma, headed by Mikhail Rodzyanko, the President of the Duma, a landlord and a monarchist. And a few days later, the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders of the executive committee of the Soviet of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies, acting secretly from the Bolsheviks, came to an agreement to form a new Provisional Government of Russia, headed by Prince Georgy Lvov. The Provisional Government included Pavel Milyukov, the head of the Constitutional-Democrats, Alexander Guchkov, the head of the Octobrists and the Socialist-Revolutionary Alexander Kerensky amongst others. The Bolsheviks condemned the new provisional government as &#x27;imperialist&#x27;.

In the new political atmosphere after the Revolution, the party resumed publishing of legal journals. It resumed the publication of its legal periodicals. &quot;Pravda&quot; appeared in Petrograd five days after the February Revolution, and &quot;Sotsial-Demokrat&quot; in Moscow a few days later.

=== Return of Lenin ===
On April 3 (16), 1917, after a long period of exile, Lenin returned to Russia. On his arrival he presented his &#x27;April Theses&#x27; to the party, formulating the political line for socialist revolution. Lenin proposed to replace the parliamentary republic by a Soviet republic as the most suitable form of political organization of society in the period of transition from capitalism
to Socialism. Furthermore, Lenin suggested discarding the term &#x27;Social Democrat&#x27; and replacing it with &#x27;Communist&#x27;. He also repeated the call for a new, Third International. The Theses were presented at a party meeting in Petrograd, and subsequently at a meeting of both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in the same city.

On April 14 a Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks was held. The conference approved Lenin&#x27;s theses and made them the basis of its work. Within a short while the local organizations of the Party had also approved Lenin&#x27;s theses. Opponents of Lenin&#x27;s included Kamenev, Rykov and Pyatakov.

=== April manifestation ===

On April 20 the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b) called upon the masses to protest against the &#x27;imperialist policy&#x27; of the Provisional Government. On April 20–21 (May 3–4), 1917, not less than 100,000 workers and soldiers took part in a demonstration. Their banners bore the demands: &quot;Publish the secret treaties!&quot;, &quot;Down with the war!&quot;, &quot;All power to the Soviets!&quot;. The workers and soldiers marched from the outskirts of the city to the centre, where the Provisional Government was sitting. On the Nevsky Prospect and other places clashes with groups of bourgeois took place.

The more outspoken counter-revolutionaries, like General Lavr Kornilov, demanded that fire be opened on the demonstrators, and even gave orders to that effect. But the troops refused to carry out the orders.

During the demonstration, a small group of members of the Petrograd Party Committee (Bagdatyev and others) issued a slogan demanding the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. The Central Committee of the party sharply condemned the conduct this grouping as adventurists, considering this slogan untimely and incorrect, a slogan that hampered the Party in its efforts to win over a majority in the Soviets and ran counter to the party line of a peaceful development of the revolution.

=== 7th party conference ===
On April 24, 1917, the Seventh (April) Conference of the RSDLP(b) assembled. For the first time in the existence of the Party a Bolshevik Conference met openly. In the history of the Party this conference holds a place of importance equal to that of a Party Congress.

The All-Russian April Conference showed that the Party was growing by leaps and bounds. The conference was attended by 133 delegates with vote and by 18 with voice but no vote. They represented 80,000 organized members of the Party. The conference discussed and laid down the Party line on all basic questions of the war and revolution: the current situation, the war, the Provisional Government, the Soviets, the agrarian question, the national question, etc.

In his report, Lenin elaborated the principles he had already set forth in the April Theses. The task of the Party was to effect the transition from the first stage of the revolution, &quot;which placed the power in the hands of the bourgeoisie . . . to the second stage, which must place the power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest strata of the peasantry&quot; (Lenin). The course the Party should take was to prepare for the Socialist revolution. The immediate task of the Party was set forth by Lenin in the slogan: &quot;All power to the Soviets!&quot;

The slogan, &quot;All power to the Soviets!&quot; meant that it was necessary to put an end to the dual power, that is, the division of power between the Provisional Government and the Soviets, to transfer the whole power to the Soviets, and to drive the representatives of the landlords and capitalists out of the organs of government.

The conference resolved that the party should agitate towards the people that the Provisional Government represented the landlords and the bourgeoisie, as well as denouncing the policy of cooperation of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.

The April Conference also discussed the agrarian and national questions. In connection with Lenin&#x27;s report on the agrarian question, the
conference adopted a resolution calling for the confiscation of the landed estates, which were to be placed at the disposal of the peasant committees, and for the nationalization of all the land.

Regarding the national question, Lenin and Stalin declared that the party must support the national liberation movements of oppressed peoples against imperialism. Consequently, the party advocated the right of nations to self-determination even to the point of secession and formation of independent states.

Lev Kamenev and Alexei Rykov opposed Lenin at the Conference. Echoing the Mensheviks, they asserted that Russia was not ripe for a Socialist revolution, and that only a bourgeois republic was possible in Russia. They recommended the Party and the working class to confine themselves to &#x27;controlling&#x27; the Provisional Government.

Zinoviev, too, opposed Lenin at the conference; it was on the question whether the Bolshevik Party should remain within the Zimmerwald alliance, or break with it and form a new International. Lenin insisted that as the years of war had shown, while this alliance carried on propaganda for peace, it did not actually break with the bourgeois partisans of the war. Lenin therefore called for immediate withdrawal from this alliance and on the formation of a new, Communist International. Zinoviev proposed that the Party should have remained within the Zimmerwald alliance. Lenin condemned Zinoviev&#x27;s proposal and called his tactics &#x27;archopportunist and pernicious.&#x27;

=== Work in the Soviets ===

On the basis of the decisions of the April Conference, the Party developed extensive activities in order to win over the masses, and to train and organize them for battle. The Party line in that period was to win a majority in the Soviets, by &#x27;explaining the Bolshevik policy and exposing the compromising policy of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, to isolate these parties from the masses&#x27;.

In addition to the work in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks carried on extensive activities in the trade unions and in the factory committees. Particularly extensive was the work of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Army. Military organizations began to arise everywhere. The Bolsheviks worked at the front and in the rear to organize the soldiers and sailors. A particularly important part in making the soldiers active revolutionaries was played at the front by the Bolshevik newspaper, &quot;Okopnaya Pravda&quot; (Trench Truth).

A Petrograd Conference of Factory Committees was held from May 30 to June 3, 1917. At this conference three-quarters of the delegates already supported the Bolsheviks. Almost the entire Petrograd proletariat supported the Bolshevik slogan—&quot;All power to the Soviets!&quot;

On June 3 (16), 1917, the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets met. The Bolsheviks were still in the minority in the Soviets; they had a little over 100 delegates at this congress, compared with 700 or 800 Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and others. At the First Congress of Soviets, the Bolsheviks insistently stressed the consequences of compromise with the bourgeoisie and exposed the imperialist character of the war. Lenin made a speech at the congress in which he declared that &#x27;only a government of Soviets could give bread to the working people, land to the peasants, secure peace and lead the country out of chaos&#x27;.

A mass campaign was being conducted at that time in the working-class districts of Petrograd for the organization of a demonstration and for the presentation of demands to the Congress of Soviets. However, the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet decided to call a demonstration for June 18 (July 1). The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries expected that the demonstration would take place under anti-Bolshevik slogans. The Bolshevik Party began energetic preparations for this demonstration. Stalin wrote in Pravda that &quot;...it is our task to make sure that the demonstration in Petrograd on June 18 takes place under our revolutionary slogans.&quot; In the rally the Bolshevik slogans prevailed over Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary ones.

=== July Days ===

In early July, widespread discontent in St. Petersburg led to militant demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Following news of a failed offensive at the front, on July 3 (16) spontaneous demonstrations started in the Vyborg District of Petrograd. They continued all day. The separate demonstrations grew into a huge general armed demonstration demanding the transfer of power to the Soviets. The party was opposed to armed action at that time, for it considered that the revolutionary crisis had not yet matured, that the army and the provinces were not yet prepared to support an uprising in the capital, and that an isolated and premature rising might only make it easier for the counter-revolutionaries to crush the vanguard of the revolution. But when it became obviously impossible to keep the masses from demonstrating, the party resolved to participate in the demonstration. Hundreds of thousands of men and women marched to the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets, where they demanded that the Soviets take
the power into their own hands, break with the bourgeoisie, and pursue an active peace policy. Notwithstanding the pacific character of the demonstration, units—detachments of officers and cadets were brought out against it. Many were killed in the skirmishes.

The ensuing crackdown resulted in the Kerensky government ordering the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership on July 19. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote &quot;State and Revolution&quot;, which outlined his ideas for a socialist government.

=== 6th Party Congress ===
The Sixth Congress of the RSDLP(b) sat in Petrograd from July 26 to August 3 (August 8–16), 1917, in semi-legal conditions. It was attended by 157 delegates voting and 110 delegates with voice but no vote, from 240,000 Party members. Lenin guided the congress from underground. He kept in touch with Petrograd through Bolsheviks assigned by the Central Committee who visited him at Razliv. Lenin&#x27;s theses &quot;The Political Situation&quot;, the article &quot;On Slogans&quot; and other items formed the basis for congress resolutions. While at Razliv, Lenin took part in drafting the most important resolutions of the congress. The congress unanimously elected Lenin its honorary chairman.

The items on the congress agenda were:

(1) Report by the Organising Bureau;
(2) Report by the C.C. R.S.D.L.P.(B.);
(3) Reports from Local Organisations;
(4) Current Situation: (a) The War and the International Situation; (b) The Political and Economic Situation;
(5) Revision of the Programme;
(6) The Organisational Question;
(7) Elections to the Constituent Assembly;
(8) The International;
(9) Unification of the Party;
(10) The Trade Union Movement;
(11) Elections;
(12) Miscellaneous.

The congress also discussed the question whether Lenin should appear in court.

The congress heard the political report of the Central Committee and the report on the political situation, both of which were presented by Stalin on behalf of the Central Committee. The resolution on the political situation was based on Lenin&#x27;s guiding recommendations. It appraised the political situation in the country following the July events, and set out the Party&#x27;s political line at the new stage of the revolution. The congress declared that the peaceful development of the revolution was over and that power in the country had virtually passed into the hands of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. In keeping with Lenin&#x27;s recommendations, it temporarily withdrew the slogan &quot;All Power to the Soviets&quot;, because just then the Soviets, led by the Mensheviks and S.R.s, were an appendage to the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. This withdrawal did not imply renunciation of the Soviets as the political form of proletarian dictatorship. The congress advanced the slogan of fighting for the complete abolition of the dictatorship of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie and for the proletariat winning power in alliance with the peasant poor, through an armed uprising.

The congress rejected the proposals put forward by Preohrazhensky, who contended that the socialist revolution could not win in Russia and that Russia could not take the socialist road unless a proletarian revolution was accomplished in the West. The congress also rebuffed Bukharin, who opposed the Party&#x27;s course for the socialist revolution, saying that the peasants formed a bloc with the bourgeoisie and would refuse to follow the working class.

The congress decisions laid special emphasis on Lenin&#x27;s thesis of the alliance of the proletariat and the peasant poor as the paramount condition for the victory of the socialist revolution. &quot;It is only the revolutionary proletariat,&quot; said the resolution &quot;The Political Situation&quot;, &quot;that can accomplish this task—a task set by the new upswing-provided it is supported by the peasant poor&quot;

The question whether Lenin should appear in court was one of the first items discussed by the congress. Stalin, who touched on it in replying to the debate on the Central Committee&#x27;s political activity, declared in favour of Lenin appearing in court, on the understanding that Lenin&#x27;s personal safety would be guaranteed and the trial conducted on democratic lines. Stalin moved a resolution to that effect.

It is not clear at the moment,&quot; he said, &quot;who is in power. There is no guarantee that if they [Lenin and Zinoviev] are arrested they will not be subjected to brute force. Things will be different if the trial is held on democratic lines and it is guaranteed that they will not be torn to pieces. When we asked the Central Executive Committee about this, they replied: &#x27;We do not know what may happen.&#x27; So long as the situation is not clear and a covert struggle is going on between the nominal and the real authority, there is no point in the comrades appearing before the authorities. If, however, power is wielded by an authority which can safeguard our comrades against violence and is fair-dealing at least to some extent ... they shall appear.

V. Volodarsky, I. Bezrabotny (D. Z. Manuilsky) and M. Lashevich spoke in favour of Lenin appearing in court (provided his safety was guaranteed, the trial was public and representatives of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets attended it), and moved a resolution in that sense.

Grigory Ordzhonikidze countered Stalin&#x27;s position that a bourgeious court could give fair trial to a revolutionary leader of the working class. He stressed that Lenin must under no circumstances be delivered into the hands of the investigators. Felix Dzerzhinsky, Mykola Skrypnik and others spoke against Lenin appearing in court. &quot;We must say clearly and explicitly,&quot; said Dzerzhinsky, &quot;that those comrades who advised Lenin not to allow himself to be arrested did well. We must make clear to all comrades that we do not trust the Provisional Government and the bourgeoisie and will not deliver Lenin until justice triumphs, that is, until that disgraceful trial is called off.&quot;

After much debate, the Sixth Party Congress unanimously passed a resolution against Lenin appearing in court, expressed its &quot;emphatic protest against the outrageous persecution of revolutionary proletarian leaders by the public prosecutor, spies and police&quot;, and sent Lenin a message of greeting.

Yakov Sverdlov reported on the Central Committee&#x27;s organising activity. He pointed out that in the three months that had passed since the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference the Party membership had trebled, increasing from 80,000 to 240,000, and the number of Party organisations had grown from 78 to 162. The congress heard nineteen reports from local organisations. The speakers stressed the vast amount of work being carried on by local organisations and the steadily growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the working people.

The congress discussed and approved the Party&#x27;s economic platform, which envisaged nationalisation and centralisation of the banks, nationalisation of large-scale industry, confiscation of the landed estates and nationalisation of all the lands in the country, establishment of workers&#x27; control over production and distribution, organisation of proper exchange between town and country, and other revolutionary measures.

The congress adopted the new Party Rules. The first clause of the Rules, dealing with membership, was supplemented with the stipulation that Party members should submit to all Party decisions. The new provision was introduced that persons seeking admission should present recommendations from two Party members and that their admission should be subject to approval by the general meeting of the organisation concerned. The Rules stressed that all Party organisations should be based on the principles of democratic centralism. Party congresses were to be convened once a year and plenary meetings of the Central Committee, not less than once in two months.

The congress reaffirmed the decision of the Seventh Conference of the RSDLP(b) on the need to revise the Party Programme in the sense indicated by the conference. It found it necessary to call a congress before long for the express purpose of adopting a new Programme, and instructed the Central Committee and all Party organisations to begin discussing a revision of the Party Programme, preparatory to the congress.

The congress resolution &quot;Youth Leagues&quot; said it was a pressing task to contribute to the formation of socialist class organisations of young workers, and obliged Party organisations to devote the greatest attention to this task. In discussing the item &quot;The Trade Union Movement&quot;, the congress criticised the theory of trade union neutrality and pointed out that the trade unions had a vital interest in carrying the revolution through to a victorious end and that they could accomplish the tasks facing Russia&#x27;s working class provided they remained militant class organisations recognising the political leadership of the Bolshevik Party.

The congress made all its decisions subordinate to the chief objective, which was to train the working class and the peasant poor for an armed uprising to bring about the victory of the socialist revolution. In a manifesto addressed to all working people, all workers, soldiers and peasants of Russia, it called on them to gather strength and prepare, under the banners of the Bolshevik Party, for the decisive battle with the bourgeoisie.

Among those the congress elected to the Central Committee were V. I. Lenin, Y. A. Berzin, A. S. Bubnov, F. E. Dzerzhinsky, A. M. Kollontai, V. P. Milyutin, M. K. Muranov, V. P. Nogin, F. A. Sergeyev (Artyom), S. G. Shahumyan, J. V. Stalin, Y. M. Sverdlov and M. S. Uritsky.

At the congress the Inter-District Organisation of United Social-Democrats, a Menshevik dissident group to which Leon Trotsky belonged, joined the party. At the time of the merger the Inter-District Organisation of United Social-Democrats had 4000 members across Russia.

=== Dual power and debates of political action ===

The repression against the Bolsheviks ceased when the Kerensky government was threatened by a rebellion led by General Kornilov, and offered arms to those who would defend St. Petersburg against Kornilov. The Bolsheviks enlisted a 25,000 strong militia to defend St. Petersburg from attack, and reached out to Kornilov&#x27;s troops, urging them not to attack. The troops stood down and the rebellion fizzled. Kornilov was taken into custody. However, the Bolsheviks did not return their arms, and Kerensky succeeded only in strengthening the Bolshevik position.

During this period, the situation of dual power endured. While the legislature and provisional government were controlled by Kerensky in coalition with the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; soviets were increasingly under the control of the Bolsheviks, who now had what amounted to their own private army. Factories, mills and military units held new elections and sent to the Soviets representatives of the RSDLP(b) in place of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. On August 31, the day following the victory over Kornilov, the Petrograd Soviet endorsed the Bolshevik policy. The old Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary Presidium of the Petrograd Soviet, headed by Nikolay Chkheidze, resigned, thus clearing the way for the Bolsheviks. On September 5, the Moscow Soviet of Workers&#x27; Deputies went over to the Bolsheviks. The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik Presidium of the Moscow Soviet also resigned and left the way clear for the Bolsheviks. Encouraged by the expansion of the influence within the Soviets the party, through its representatives with the Soviets, was able to call for a Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in the second half of October 1917.

=== Insurrection vs. Parliamentarism ===
The RSDLP(b) Central Committee spent September and October 1917 debating whether they should use parliamentary methods or whether they should seize power by force. With Lenin in hiding in Finland, the parliamentary line– advocated by Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and Rykov against Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky– at first prevailed. The Bolsheviks participated in the quasiparliamentary bodies convened by the Provisional Government, the All-Russian Democratic Conference and the smaller, more permanent Pre-Parliament.

Lenin sent numerous letters to the Central Committee and to St. Petersburg party activists urging them to abandon the parliamentary path and overthrow the Provisional Government by means of an insurrection. In his articles and letters Lenin outlined a detailed plan for the uprising showing how the army units, the navy and the Red Guards would be used, what key positions in Petrograd would be seized in order to ensure the success of the uprising, and so forth.

On October 7, Lenin secretly arrived in Petrograd from Finland. On the same day the balance of power within the Central Committee shifted in favor of the insurrection in early October, resulting in the party delegation withdrawing from the Pre-Parliament.

On October 10 the meeting of the Central Committee of the Party took place at which it was decided to launch the armed uprising within the next few days. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Party, drafted by Lenin, stated:

Two members of the Central Committee, Zinoviev and Kamenev, spoke and voted against this decision. Although at this meeting Trotsky did not vote against the resolution directly, he moved an amendment proposing that the uprising should not be started before the Second Congress of Soviets met.

=== Preparing for the insurrection ===
The Central Committee of the party sent its representatives to the Donetz Basin, the Urals, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, the South-Western Front and other places to organize the uprising. Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Feliks Dzerzhinsky, Sergo Ordjonikidze, Sergei Kirov, Lazar Kaganovich, Valerian Kuibyshev, Mikhail Frunze, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky and others were specially assigned by the party to direct the uprising in the provinces. Andrei Zhdanov carried on the work among the armed forces in Shadrinsk, in the Urals. Nikolai Yezhov made preparations for an uprising of the soldiers on the Western Front, in Byelorussia. The representatives of the Central Committee acquainted the leading members of the Bolshevik organizations in the provinces with the plan of the uprising and mobilized them in
readiness to support the uprising in Petrograd.

On the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, a Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet was set up. This body became the legally functioning headquarters of the uprising.

On October 16 an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Party was held. This meeting elected a Party Centre, headed by Stalin, to direct the uprising. This Party Centre was the leading core of the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and had practical direction of the whole uprising.

At the meeting of the Central Committee Zinoviev and Kamenev again opposed the uprising. Meeting with a rebuff, they came out openly in the press against the uprising, against the Party. On October 18 the Menshevik newspaper, &quot;Novaya Zhizn&quot;, printed a statement by Kamenev and Zinoviev declaring that the Bolsheviks were making preparations for an uprising, and that they (Kamenev and Zinoviev) considered it an adventurous gamble. Lenin wrote in this connection: &quot;Kamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed the decision of the Central Committee of their Party on the armed uprising to Rodzyanko and Kerensky.&quot; Lenin put before the Central Committee the question of Zinoviev&#x27;s and Kamenev&#x27;s expulsion from the party for breaching party discipline, having disclosed the secret plans for an armed insurrection.

On October 21 the party sent commissars of the Revolutionary Military Committee to all revolutionary army units. Throughout the remaining days before the uprising energetic preparations for action were made in the army units and in the mills and factories. Precise instructions were also issued to the warships &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Zarya Svobody&quot;. Wary of a preemptive counterattack of the Kerensky government, the Central Committee of the party decided to initiate the uprising before the appointed time, and set its date for the day before the opening of the Second Congress of Soviets.

=== Insurrection in Petrograd ===
===Onset===

Kerensky began his attack on the early morning of October 24 (November 6) by ordering the suppression of the central organ of the party, &quot;Rabochy Put&quot; (Workers&#x27; Path), and the dispatch of armoured cars to its editorial premises and to the printing plant of the Bolsheviks. By 10 am, however, on the instructions of Stalin, Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers pressed back the armoured cars and placed a reinforced guard over the printing plant and the &quot;Rabochy Put&quot; editorial offices. Towards 11 am Rabochy Put came out with a call for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Simultaneously, on the instructions of the Party Centre of the uprising, detachments of revolutionary soldiers and Red Guards were rushed to the Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. Thus the uprising had begun.

On the night of October 24 Lenin arrived at the Smolny Institute and assumed personal direction of the uprising. During that night revolutionary units of the army and detachments of the Red Guard kept arriving at the Smolny. The Bolsheviks directed them to the centre of the capital, to surround the Winter Palace, where the Provisional Government had entrenched itself.

On October 25 (November 7), Red Guards and revolutionary troops occupied the railway stations, post office, telegraph office, the Ministries and the State Bank. The Pre-parliament was declared dissolved. The Smolny, the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and of the Bolshevik Central Committee, became the headquarters of the revolution, from which fighting orders emanated. The uprising also included the navy forces. The cruise ship &quot;Aurora&quot; turned its guns on the Winter Palace.

On October 25 (November 7) the Bolsheviks issued a manifesto &#x27;To the Citizens of Russia&#x27; announcing that the Provisional Government had been deposed and that state power had passed into the hands of the Soviets. The Provisional Government had taken refuge in the Winter Palace under the protection of cadets and shock battalions. On the night of October 25 the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace by storm and arrested the Provisional Government. At this point Petrograd was under the authority of the Bolshevik Party.

=== Second Congress of Soviets ===

The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened in the Smolny at 10:45 pm on October 25 (November 7), 1917, when the uprising in Petrograd was already in motion and the power in the capital had &quot;de facto&quot; passed into the hands of the Petrograd Soviet. The Bolsheviks secured an overwhelming majority at the congress. The Mensheviks, Bundists and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries left the congress, announcing that they refused to take any part in its labours. In a statement which was read at the Congress of Soviets they referred to the ongoing uprising as a &#x27;military plot&#x27;. The congress then condemned the position of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The congress proclaimed that all power had passed to the Soviets:

On the night of October 26 (November 8) the Second Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree on Peace. The congress called upon the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice for a period of not less than three months to permit negotiations for peace to put an end to the ongoing World War.

While addressing itself to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent countries, the congress at the same time appealed to &#x27;the class-conscious workers of the three most advanced nations of mankind and the largest states participating in the present war, namely, Great Britain, France and Germany.&#x27; It called upon these workers to help &#x27;to bring to a successful conclusion the cause of peace, and at the same time the cause of the emancipation of the toiling and exploited masses of the population from all forms of slavery and all forms of exploitation.&#x27;

That same night the Second Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree on Land, which proclaimed that &#x27;Landed proprietorship is abolished forthwith without compensation.&#x27; The basis adopted for this agrarian law was a Mandate (Nakaz) of the peasantry, compiled from 242 mandates of peasants of various localities. In accordance with this Mandate private ownership of land was to be abolished forever and replaced by public, or state ownership of the land. The lands of the landlords, of the tsar&#x27;s family and of the monasteries were to be turned over to all the toilers. By this decree the peasantry received over 400,000,000 acres (1,600,000 km2) of land that had formerly belonged to the landlords, the bourgeoisie, the tsar&#x27;s family, the monasteries and the churches. Moreover, the peasants were released from paying rent to the landlords, which had amounted to about 500,000,000 gold rubles annually.

All mineral resources (oil, coal, ores, etc.), forests and waters were declared to be the property of the people.

Lastly, Congress established a new government called the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (&quot;Sovnarkom&quot;). Lenin became the Chairman of the new government, literally Premier, Trotsky became the first People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and other Bolshevik leaders took over other government ministries, which were known as &quot;commissariats&quot; until 1946.

=== Spread of the revolution ===
Soon the news of the uprising in Petrograd reached the other parts of the empire. For several days in Moscow the street were the scenes of street battles between Bolsheviks and opponents of the revolution.

=== Attempts of counter-revolution ===
The now deposed Kerensky attempted to retake Petrograd. On November 10, 1917, Kerensky, who during the uprising had fled from Petrograd to the Northern Front, mustered several Cossack units and dispatched them against Petrograd under the command of General Pyotr Krasnov. On November 11, 1917, an organization calling itself the Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland and the Revolution headed by Socialist-Revolutionaries, raised a mutiny of cadets in Petrograd. But the mutiny was suppressed by sailors and Red Guards without in evening of the same day, and on November 13 General Krasnov was routed near the Pulkovskiye Heights. Lenin personally directed the suppression of the anti-Soviet mutiny.

In Moghilev, at the General Headquarters of the Army, General Nikolay Dukhonin, the Commander-in-Chief, also attempted a mutiny. When the Soviet Government instructed him to start immediate negotiations for an armistice with the German Command, he refused to obey. Thereupon Dukhonin was dismissed by order of the Soviet Government. The General Headquarters was broken up and Dukhonin himself was killed by the soldiers, who had risen against him.

=== Debates of the line of the party ===
One sector of the party leadership, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov, Shlyapnikov and others, differed with Lenin over the political line of the party. They called for the formation of an &#x27;all-Socialist government&#x27;, which to include Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. On November 15, 1917, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party adopted a resolution rejecting agreement with these parties, and proclaiming &#x27;Kamenev and Zinoviev&#x27; strikebreakers of the revolution. On November 17, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Milyutin, disagreeing with the policy of the Party, announced their resignation from the Central Committee.

That same day, November 17, Nogin, in his own name and in the names of Rykov, V. Milyutin, Teodorovich, A. Shlyapnikov, D. Ryazanov, Yurenev and Larin, members of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, announced their disagreement with the policy of the Central Committee of the Party and their resignation from the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. The Central Committee of the party branded them as &#x27;deserters&#x27; from the revolution and &#x27;accomplices of the bourgeoisie&#x27;.

=== Relation to the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries ===

The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had a significant influence in the countryside, initially sided with the Bolsheviks. The Congress of Peasant
Soviets which took place in November 1917 endorsed the Soviet Government. An agreement was reached between the RSDLP(b) and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and several of the Left SR leaders were given posts in the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Kolegayev, Spiridonova, Proshyan and Steinberg). However, this agreement lasted only until the signing of the Peace of Brest-Litovsk and the formation of the Poor Peasants Committees, when a deep cleavage took place among the peasantry. At this point the Left SRs sided with the more affluent peasants and initiated a revolt against Soviet power. The revolt was suppressed by the Soviet Government.

=== Brest-Litovsk peace ===

However, Russia was still at war with the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. In the view of the Bolsheviks, the war had to be ended in order to consolidate Soviet power. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic called upon &#x27;all the belligerent peoples and their governments to start immediate negotiations for a just, democratic peace&#x27;. But the former allies of Russia—the United Kingdom and France—refused to accept the proposal of the Soviet Government. In view of this refusal, the Soviet Government decided to start negotiations with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The negotiations began on December 3 in Brest-Litovsk. On December 5 an armistice was signed.

Large sectors of the Russian political spectrum, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to the Whiteguards, opposed the negotiation policy of the Soviet Government. Moreover, a sector within the party had their doubts about the line of negotiations. Trotsky on one hand and the &#x27;Left Communists&#x27; (led by Bukharin, a grouping also including Radek and Pyatakov) argued that the war should have been continued.

On February 10, 1918, the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk were broken off. Although Lenin and Stalin had argued that peace be signed, Trotsky, who was chairman of the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, won the vote at the party&#x27;s executive committee on 22 January 1918 and on 10 February 1918 promulgated his &quot;no peace, no war&quot; policy: the Soviet negotiators left the negotiations in the hope that pro-peace factions in the German Reichstag would ensure that Germany did not resume the conflict. Fighting resumed, and the German forces made rapid advances into Russian territory.

At this juncture the RSDLP(b) and the Soviet Government issued the call– &#x27;The Socialist fatherland is in danger!&#x27;, urging the working class to join the Red Army.

On February 18, 1918, the Central Committee of the party approved Lenin&#x27;s proposal to send a telegram to the German government offering to conclude an immediate peace. However, the German offensive was maintained for a few days. The German government expressed its willingness to sign peace on February 22.

Within the party, the debates continued. Bukharin and Trotsky, Lenin declared, &quot;actually helped the German imperialists and hindered the growth and development of the revolution in Germany&quot;. On February 23, the Central Committee decided to accept the terms of the German Command and to sign the peace treaty. Large territories, including Estonia, Latvia and Poland, were passed over to German control, and Ukraine was converted into a separate state under German dominance. Moreover, the Soviet Government undertook to pay an indemnity to the Germans.

The Moscow Regional Bureau of the party, of which the &#x27;Left Communists&#x27; (Bukharin, Ossinsky, Yakovleva, Stukov and Mantsev) had temporarily seized control, passed a resolution of no-confidence in the Central Committee. The bureau declared that it considered &#x27;a split in the Party in the very near future scarcely avoidable.&#x27; Moreover, the resolution declared that &#x27;In the interests of the international revolution, we consider it expedient to consent to the possible loss of the Soviet power, which has now become purely formal.&#x27; Lenin branded this decision as &#x27;strange and monstrous.&#x27;

Later official Soviet history stated that this move on behalf of Trotsky, Bukharin and their followers had been part of a conspiracy to break the Brest-Litovsk agreement and to overthrow Lenin.

=== 7th Party Congress ===

The debate on the peace question was a major issue at the 7th party congress, inaugurated on March 6, 1918. This was the first congress held after the party had taken power. It was attended by 46 delegates with vote and 58 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 145,000 Party members. Actually, the membership of the Party at that time was not less than 270,000. The discrepancy was because, owing to the urgency with which the congress met, a large number of the organizations were unable to send delegates in time; and the organizations in the territories then occupied by the Germans were unable to send delegates at all.

Reporting at this congress on the Brest-Litovsk Peace, Lenin said that &#x27;...the severe crisis which our Party is now experiencing, owing to the formation of a Left opposition within it, is one of the gravest crises the Russian revolution has experienced.&#x27;

The resolution submitted by Lenin on the subject of the Brest-Litovsk Peace was adopted by 30 votes against 12, with 4 abstentions. On the day following the adoption of this resolution, Lenin wrote an article entitled &#x27;A Distressful Peace&#x27;, in which he said:

In its resolution, the congress declared that further military attacks on the Soviet Republic were inevitable, and that therefore the congress considered it the fundamental task of the Party to adopt the most resolute measures to organize the Red Army and to introduce universal military training.

Moreover, the congress decided to change the name of the party to Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks), in order to differentiate it from the Mensheviks and other remaining factions originating from the RSDLP.

At the congress a special commission, which included Lenin and Stalin, was elected to draw up a new Party program, Lenin&#x27;s draft program having been accepted as a basis.

=== Invasion, Civil War and War Communism ===

The Soviet Republic soon found itself under military attack, both from a large number of foreign states as well as domestic opposition, the so-called Whites. In response to the military threats against the Soviet Republic the RCP(b) proclaimed the country an armed camp and placed its economic, cultural and political life on a war footing. The Soviet Government announced that &#x27;the Socialist fatherland is in danger&#x27; and called mobilization into the Red Army. Lenin issued the slogan, &#x27;All for the front!&#x27;. About half the membership of the party and of the Young Communist League went to the front. In the propaganda of the party it was a war for the fatherland, a war against the foreign invaders and against the revolts of the exploiting classes whom the revolution had overthrown. The Council of Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Defence, organized by Lenin, directed the work of supplying the front with reinforcements, food, clothing and arms.

At this juncture the Socialist-Revolutionaries, began assassinating leading party members. They killed Uritsky and Volodarsky, and had made an attempt on the life of Lenin. Following this, the &#x27;Red terror&#x27; was unleashed upon them and throughout Russia the Socialist-Revolutionaries were crushed.

The party took active part in the military affairs, through the Political Commissars within the Red Army. The Political Commissats were responsible for political and ideological training with the army units.

Faced with a situation of extreme material hardships, the Soviet Government introduced the policies of War Communism. It took under its control the middle-sized and small industries, in addition to large-scale industry, so as to accumulate goods for the supply of the army and the agricultural population. It introduced a state monopoly of the grain trade, prohibited private trading in grain and established the surplus-appropriation system, under which all surplus produce in the hands of the peasants was to be registered and acquired by the state at fixed prices, so as to accumulate stores of grain for the provisioning of the army and the workers. Lastly, it introduced universal labour service for all classes. In the viewpoint of the party, the principle of &#x27;He who does not work, neither shall he eat&#x27; was put into practice.

=== Defeat of Germany ===
The First World War ended with the defeat of Germany and the overthrow of the German government. The Soviet Government now annulled its commitment to the Brest-Litovsk agreement and initiated a military and political struggle to reclaim Estonia, Latvia, Byelorussia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Transcaucasia.

=== Foundation of the Third International ===

Ever since the break with the Second International, the Bolsheviks had argued for the creation of a new Third, Communist International. In the new situation in Europe, with Soviet rule established in Russia and revolutionary uprisings taking place in Germany, Austria and Hungary, and with the traditional Social Democracy divided in many countries, a constitutive congress of the Communist International was held in March 1919. The RCP(b) was one of the founding parties of the new international, and its headquarters were in Moscow.

=== 8th Party Congress ===

The Eighth Congress of RCP(b) was held in March 1919. It assembled in the midst war. The congress was attended by 301 delegates with vote, representing 313,766 members of the Party, and 102 delegates with voice but no vote. In his inaugural speech, Lenin paid homage to the memory of Y. M. Sverdlov, who had died on the eve of the congress.

The congress adopted a new Party Program. This program included a description of capitalism and imperialism, and compared two systems of state– the bourgeois-democratic system and the Soviet system. It specified the specific tasks of the Party in the struggle for socialism: completion of the expropriation of the bourgeoisie; administration of the economic life of the country in accordance with a single socialist plan; participation of the trade unions in the organization of the national economy; socialist labour discipline; utilization of bourgeois experts in the economic field under the control of Soviet bodies; gradual and systematic enlistment of the middle peasantry in the work of socialist construction.

The congress adopted Lenin&#x27;s proposal to include in the program in addition to a definition of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism, the description of industrial capitalism and simple commodity production contained in the old program adopted at the Second Party Congress (of the RSDLP). Lenin considered it essential that the program should take account of the complexity of the economic system and note the existence of diverse economic formations in the country, including small commodity production, as represented by the middle peasants.

Bukharin, however, proposed that the clauses dealing with capitalism, small commodity production, the economy of the middle peasantry, should have been left out of the program.

Bukharin and Pyatakov differed with Lenin on the national question. Bukharin and Pyatakov argued against the inclusion in the program of a clause on the right of nations to self-determination; claiming that the slogan that would hinder the victory of the proletarian revolution and the union of the proletarians of different nationalities. Lenin refuted the standpoints of Bukharin and Pyatakov.

An important place in the deliberations of the Eighth Congress was devoted to policy towards the middle peasants. The Decree on the Land had resulted in a steady growth in the number of middle peasants, who now comprised the majority of the peasant population. In the analysis of the party, the attitude and conduct of the middle peasantry was of momentous importance for the fate of the Civil War and Socialist construction. The analysis stipulated that the outcome of the Civil War would largely depended on which way the middle peasantry would swing, which group would win its allegiance.

The new policy towards the middle peasant proclaimed by Lenin at the Eighth Congress required that the proletariat should rely on the poor peasant, maintain a stable alliance with the middle peasant and fight against the &#x27;kulak&#x27; (rich peasant). The policy of the party before the Eighth Congress was in general one of neutralizing the middle peasant. This meant that the Party strove to prevent the middle peasant from siding with the kulak and with the bourgeoisie in general. But now this was not enough. The Eighth Congress passed from a policy of neutralization of the middle peasantry to a policy of stable alliance with them for the purpose of the struggle against the Whites and foreign intervention.

The problems connected with the building up of the Red Army held a special place in the deliberations of the congress, where the so-called &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27; appeared in the field. This &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27; comprised a number of former members of the now shattered group of &#x27;Left Communists&#x27;; but it also included some party cadres who had never participated in any oppositional activity, but were dissatisfied with the way Trotsky was conducting the affairs of the army. The &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27; was hostile to Trotsky on the grounds that he relied on military experts of the old tsarist army, enemies in the eyes of the &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27;.

Lenin and Stalin condemned the &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27;, because it defended the survival of the guerrilla mode of operations and resisted the creation of a regular Red Army, the utilization of the military experts of the old army and the establishment of strict military discipline. In his response to the &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27;, Stalin said:

A Military Commission was set up at the congress. The motivation behind this decision was to strengthen the Red Army and to bring it still closer to the party.

The congress further discussed party and Soviet affairs and the guiding role of the party in the Soviets. During the debate on the latter question the congress repudiated the view of the Sapronov-Ossinsky group which held that the Party should not guide the work of the Soviets.

Lastly, in view of the huge influx of new members into the Party, the congress outlined measures to improve the social composition of the party and decided to conduct a re-registration of its members. This initiated the first purge of the Party ranks.

On March 25, 1919, the Central Committee elected by the 8th congress appointed a Politburo consisting of Kamenev, N. Krestinsky, Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky, and with Bukharin, Zinovyev and Kalinin as candidate members.

=== 9th Party Congress ===

The 9th Party Congress met at the end of March 1920. It was attended by 554 delegates with vote, representing 611,978 Party members, and 162 delegates with voice but no vote. The congress defined the immediate tasks of the country in the sphere of transportation and industry. It particularly stressed the necessity of the trade unions taking part in the building up of the economic life.

Special attention was devoted by the congress to a single economic plan for the restoration, in the first place, of the railways, the fuel industry and the iron and steel industry. The major item in this plan was a project for the electrification of the country, which Lenin advanced as &#x27;a great program for the next ten or twenty years&#x27;. This formed the basis of the plan of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia (GOELRO).

The congress rejected the views of a group which called itself the Group of Democratic Centralism and was opposed to one-man management and the undivided responsibility of industrial directors. It advocated unrestricted &#x27;group management&#x27; under which nobody would be personally responsible for the administration of industry. The chief figures in this group were Sapronov, Ossinsky and Y. Smirnov. They were supported at the congress by Rykov and Tomsky.

=== In Baku ===
On February 20, 1920, the local cell of the party in Baku merged with the Hummat Party, the Adalat Party and the Ahrar Party of Iran, forming the Communist Party of Azerbaijan.

=== Merger of the Party of Revolutionary Communism ===
In 1920, after the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern had decided that there should be only one communist party in every country, the Party of Revolutionary Communism dissolved itself, and its members joined the RCP(b).

== Tenth Party Congress ==
The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the Tenth Party Congress of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the &quot;Workers&#x27; Opposition&quot;, and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party.

In 1922 the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) (EKP) merged into the &quot;Yevsektsiya&quot;, the Jewish section of the party. This was one of two Poalei Zion (left zionists) groupings active in Russia at the time. The other, the Jewish Communist Labour Party (Poalei Zion), was prohibited in 1928.

== Stalin&#x27;s rise to power ==

The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. On Lenin&#x27;s motion, Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party in April 1922.

The next month Lenin suffered his first stroke and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deteriorated. Lenin&#x27;s role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the Politburo ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924.

As a result of Lenin&#x27;s illness, the position of general secretary became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin&#x27;s power grew. Following Lenin&#x27;s third stroke a troika made up of Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block Trotsky from taking power . Lenin, however, had become increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of Lenin&#x27;s Testament and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus.

Zinoviev and Bukharin became concerned about Stalin&#x27;s increasing power and proposed that the Orgburo which Stalin, but no other members of the Politburo, be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin&#x27;s role as general secretary. Stalin reacted furiously and the Orgburo was retained but Bukharin, Trotsky and Zinoviev were added to the body.

Due to growing political differences with Trotsky and his Left Opposition in the fall of 1923, the troika of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev reunited. At the Twelfth Party Congress in 1923, Trotsky failed to use Lenin&#x27;s Testament as a tool against Stalin for fear of endangering the stability of the party.

Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the Central Committee but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin&#x27;s objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament.

Meanwhile, the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of People&#x27;s Commissar of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay &quot;Lessons of October&quot; which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin&#x27;s plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of permanent revolution which contradicted Stalin&#x27;s position that socialism could be built in one country, Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky&#x27;s theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned.

With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin&#x27;s power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with Bukharin and his allies on the right of the party who supported the New Economic Policy and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at the Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of Lenin&#x27;s Testament which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky&#x27;s previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like Molotov, Voroshilov and Mikhail Kalinin. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as &quot;leader&quot; for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.

Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev formed a United Opposition against the policies of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence as a result of the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults and humiliations and in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself.

Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky&#x27;s criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new general line favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a Right Opposition.

At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin&#x27;s new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin&#x27;s Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commissariats Stalin&#x27;s control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.

== Purge of the Old Bolsheviks ==

In the 1930s other senior Communists, many of whom had been Stalin&#x27;s allies were removed and many of them were executed or died in mysterious circumstances, including Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, Alexei Rykov and Nikolai Bukharin. Joseph Stalin instigated a series of purges against senior members of the party, culminating in the Great Purge of 1935 to 1938, with the key processes known as Moscow Trials.

There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin&#x27;s struggle for power. At the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) (February 1934) Sergei Kirov only received three negative votes in the election to the Politburo showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to Molotov&#x27;s memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of General Secretary against Stalin.

Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 &quot;Congress of Victors&quot;, 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police. Of 139 members of the Central Committee, 98 were arrested.

Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov&#x27;s murder. Zinoviev and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to show trials before being executed. The &quot;investigation&quot; continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into labor camps. Stalin claimed that Kirov&#x27;s assassin, Leonid Nikolaev, was part of a larger conspiracy led by Zinoviev, Kamenev and ultimately Leon Trotsky against the Soviet government.

Additional triggers for the purge may have been the refusal by the Politburo in 1932 to approve the execution of M. N. Riutin, an Old Bolshevik who had distributed a 200-page pamphlet calling for the removal of Stalin and their refusal in 1933 to approve the execution of A.P. Smirnov, who had been a party member since 1896 and had also been found to be agitating for Stalin&#x27;s removal.

The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti-Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin&#x27;s mind with Kirov&#x27;s growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy&#x27;s power over the party and the state.

The Moscow Trials lasted until 1938 and were used to blame various former oppositionists (as well as numerous supporters of Stalin who were considered suspect for some reason or another) with the failure of Stalin&#x27;s Five Year Plan to meet its goals as well as other problems in the Soviet Union. Numerous Bolsheviks including Bukharin, Radek, Rykov and Rakovsky were accused of plotting to overthrow Stalin or even conspiring with Hitler against the USSR and were tried and executed.

The Great Purge saw the removal of 850,000 members from the Party, or 36% of its membership, between 1936 and 1938. Many of these individuals were executed or perished in prison camps. &quot;Old Bolsheviks&quot; who had been members of the Party in 1917 were especially targeted.

At the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) held in 1939, only 2% of the delegates had also been delegates to the last congress held in 1934.

== Stalinism ==
The labor camps were expanded into the infamous Gulag system under Stalin in his war against so-called &quot;class enemies&quot;. Stalin also undertook massive resettlements of Kulaks, similarly to the Tsarist penal system of &quot;ssylka&quot; (resettlement in remote areas) which had been established to deal with political dissidents and common criminals without executing them.

As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a cult of personality. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision.

At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov and Mikoyan removed from the Politburo and diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium (plus eleven candidates) that was twice the old Politburo&#x27;s size. However, an informal Bureau of the Presidium, comparable to the old Politburo, was established in order to make decision-making more manageable. This bureau consisted of Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Maksim Saburov, and Mikhail Pervukhin, with future decision-making limited in practice to the first four or five of these.

== After Stalin ==

Stalin&#x27;s death on March 5, 1953, unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. Molotov had been widely thought to be Stalin&#x27;s obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin&#x27;s final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin&#x27;s death). The struggle for succession became a contest between Lavrentiy Beria (the feared leader of the NKVD), Georgy Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev.

At the meeting of the Presidium&#x27;s inner bureau held immediately after Stalin&#x27;s death, Beria proposed Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 – the new Presidium had exactly the same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and Mikoyan were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the position of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party Secretariat on March 14, 1953, in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov&#x27;s assumption of both leadership roles.

Despite Beria&#x27;s history as Stalin&#x27;s most ruthless subordinates, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin&#x27;s death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the Doctors&#x27; plot as a &quot;fraud&quot; but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the gulags (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of Russification and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the Socialist Unity Party regime of Walter Ulbricht in East Germany to slow down the &quot;construction of socialism&quot; and institute liberal economic and political reforms.

The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. Khrushchev was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria&#x27;s initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria&#x27;s urging the East German government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet Armed Forces troops (see Uprising of 1953 in East Germany).

The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabilising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective putsch against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin&#x27;s death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khrushchev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium.

With Beria, Malenkov&#x27;s ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanoeuver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khrushchev won the support of Bulganin to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government.

The 20th Congress of the CPSU held in 1956 marked the party&#x27;s formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev gave his famous &quot;Secret Speech&quot; denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of destalinisation which saw an end to the personality cult which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khrushchev but Georgy Zhukov the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev&#x27;s demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called Anti-Party Group from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary.

The execution of Beria also brought the NKVD and its successor, the KGB under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria&#x27;s arrest and execution brought an end to much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in Gulags that had marked the Stalin era.

Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials.

Khrushchev&#x27;s prestige was severely damaged as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the Central Committee due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came to a halt under the new General Secretary, Leonid Brezhnev who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with Nikolai Podgorny to oust Khrushchev and then outmanoeuvering Nikolai Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of Lavrentiy Beria in 1953. When Georgy Malenkov, Molotov, Kaganovich and other members of the so-called Anti-Party Group were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against Khrushchev they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to Mongolia in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khrushchev himself was deposed in 1964.

Though initially, the USSR was again under a collective leadership, this time with Brezhnev as General Secretary, Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium and Alexei Kosygin as Premier of the Soviet Union. Brezhnev was able to consolidate power to become the leading figure, but he was never able to gather as much powers as Stalin and Khrushchev had done previously. At the 23rd Congress of the CPSU held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to pursue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry (&quot;see&quot; Kosygin reform), Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev&#x27;s policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982. The aging Soviet leadership led to its being described as a gerontocracy. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a personality cult around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

== Gorbachev ==

Mikhail Gorbachev became the party&#x27;s general secretary in 1985 following an interregnum after the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 when the party was led first by Yuri Andropov and then by Konstantin Chernenko. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was &quot;the&quot; leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984, and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise stopgap candidate as Gorbachev – Andropov&#x27;s protege – lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko&#x27;s death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.

Gorbachev instituted policies of glasnost, perestroika, and acceleration. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the Russian Revolution, perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particularly the economic organisation of the country, while acceleration meant faster development of the economy. This period of liberalisation ultimately ended in the dissolution of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe.

At the 27th Congress of the CPSU in 1986, Boris Yeltsin became a candidate member of the Politburo and offended party members in a speech that attacked the hidden privileges of the party elite.

At the 1988 Party Conference Gorbachev launched reforms to reduce the party&#x27;s control over the government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships. While Gorbachev was able to receive approval for his reforms from the party, the membership of the CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant to Gorbachev&#x27;s policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservatism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies.

== End of Communist rule ==

In 1989 Gorbachev allowed other political associations (de facto political parties) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its vanguard status. The Communist Party&#x27;s power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created post of President of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was elected to this post, which allowed him to remain head of state. From this point onward, Gorbachev&#x27;s real power came from the presidency, though he remained general secretary.

By the time of the 28th Congress of the CPSU in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society, the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united.

The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the August Coup in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the &quot;New Union Treaty&quot; was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the &quot;State Emergency Committee&quot; seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Vice President Gennady Yanayev was named acting president. The committee&#x27;s eight members included Yanayev, KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, Internal Affairs Minister Boris Pugo, Defense Minister Dmitriy Yazov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov. The coup failed because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of Boris Yeltsin, who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. The KGB was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations.

The coup destroyed the CPSU politically. By nearly all accounts, the coup proved that the party was beyond reform. For all intents and purposes, Communist rule in the Soviet Union ended on August 24. That day, Gorbachev dissolved the Central Committee, resigned as general secretary and ordered all party units in the government dissolved. Vladimir Ivashko was chosen as acting general secretary later that day. However, actual political power lay in the positions of President of the Soviet Union (held by Gorbachev) and President of the Russian SFSR (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29, when the Supreme Soviet suspended all party activities on Soviet territory.

On November 6, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all CPSU activities on Russian territory and confiscating all party property in Russia. On November 30, 1992; the Russian Constitutional Court not only upheld this decree, but barred the CPSU from ever being refounded. It accepted Yeltsin&#x27;s argument that the CPSU was not a true party, but a criminal organisation that had ruled the Soviet Union as a dictatorship in violation of the Soviet Constitution.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia. Besides CPRF was founded during the Gorbachev era, several years before CPSU was abolished and was seen as a &quot;Russian-nationalist&quot; counterpart to CPSU.

In other republics, communists established the Armenian Communist Party, Communist Party of Azerbaijan, Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan, Communist Party of Ukraine, Party of Communists of Belarus, Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Communist Party of Tajikistan. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (SKP-KPSS). The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova currently holds 32 seats in the Parliament of Moldova as of the 2021 parliamentary election, while Party of Communists of Belarus currently holds 11 seats in the Belarusian House of Representatives as of the 2019 parliamentary election.

In Turkmenistan, the local party apparatus led by Saparmurat Niyazov was converted into the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, which remains the ruling party of the country under Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.

In Uzbekistan, Uzbek First Secretary Islam Karimov converted the CPSU branch into the People&#x27;s Democratic Party, which ruled the country until Karimov formed the Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party in 1996.

In Georgia, the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the Communist Party of Georgia (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the United Communist Party of Georgia (SEKP).

In Estonia, the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the Estonian Democratic Labour Party (EDTP), which later merged into the Estonian United Left Party. A minority regrouped into the Communist Party of Estonia.

In Lithuania, the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. Branch of &quot;progressive&quot; communists led by Algirdas Brazauskas converted into the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, established in 1992. It later merged into the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in 2001. In Latvia, communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the Latvian Social Democratic Party. The remnants of CPSU became the Union of Communists of Latvia, which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the Socialist Party of Latvia, which holds one seat in the Saeima after the 2018 parliamentary election.

<text>The Polillo Islands is a group of about 27 islands in the Philippine Sea lying about to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. It is separated from the mainland Luzon Island by the Polillo Strait and forms the northern side of Lamon Bay. The islands are part of the province of Quezon in the Calabarzon region of the Philippines. The combined land area of all the islands is about 875 square kilometers making Polillo islands even larger than the island city-state of Singapore.

==Major islands==

The three major islands are:

*Polillo Island 
*Patnanungan Island 
*Jomalig Island 

These islands comprise the towns of Polillo, Patnanungan, Jomalig, Panukulan and Burdeos.

The biggest Polillo Island is divided into three municipalities of Polillo, Burdeos, and Panukulan. 

Burdeos Bay lies in between the islands of Patnanungan and Polillo

Polillo also includes the privately-owned resort island of Balesin, located further south in the middle of Lamon Bay.

*Polillo (southern part of Polillo Island, including Balesin Island)
*Burdeos (northeastern part of Polillo Island, including smaller islands like Palasan, Kalotkot, and Kalongkooan)
*Panukulan (northwestern part of Polillo Island)
*Patnanungan (middle island)
*Jomalig (easternmost island)

<doc id="1134149" wikidata="Q1503219" url="?curid=1134149" title="Geology of the Death Valley area">
<text>The exposed geology of the Death Valley area presents a diverse and complex set of at least 23 formations of sedimentary units, two major gaps in the geologic record called unconformities, and at least one distinct set of related formations geologists call a group. The oldest rocks in the area that now includes Death Valley National Park are extensively metamorphosed by intense heat and pressure and are at least 1700 million years old. These rocks were intruded by a mass of granite 1400 Ma (million years ago) and later uplifted and exposed to nearly 500 million years of erosion.

Marine deposition occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, forming thick sequences of conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear parts of the supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed on the edges of these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate at the base of the submerged precipice, entombing the region&#x27;s first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.

The passive margin switched to active margin in the early-to-mid Mesozoic when the Farallon Plate under the Pacific Ocean started to dive below the North American Plate, initiating a subduction zone; volcanoes and uplifting mountains were produced as a result. Erosion over many millions of years formed a relatively featureless plain. Stretching of the crust under western North America started around 16 Ma and is thought to be caused by upwelling from the subducted spreading-zone of the Farallon Plate. This process continues into the present and is thought to be responsible for producing the Basin and Range province. By 2 to 3 million years ago this province had spread to the Death Valley area, ripping it apart and giving birth to Death Valley, Panamint Valley and surrounding ranges. These valleys partially filled with sediment and, during colder periods during the current ice age, with lakes. Lake Manly was the largest of these lakes; it filled Death Valley during each glacial period from 240,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago. By 10,500 years ago these lakes were increasingly cut off from glacial melt from the Sierra Nevada, starving them of water and concentrating salts and minerals. The desert environment seen today developed after these lakes dried up.

== Early sedimentation ==
=== Proterozoic complex ===
Little is known about the history of the oldest exposed rocks in the area due to extensive metamorphism. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and igneous rocks with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.

A mass of granite now in the Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite are also in the complex (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep underground and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and was the result of a failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.

Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian basement rocks were uplifted and a nearly 500-million-year-long gap in the geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists do not know what happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.

=== Pahrump Group ===
The Pahrump Group of formations were deposited from 1200 to 800 mya in the Amargosa aulacogen. This was after uplift-associated erosion removed whatever rocks covered the Proterozoic Complex. Pahrump is composed of, from oldest to youngest:
* Crystal Spring Formation,
* Beck Spring Dolomite,
* Kingston Peak Formation.
Outcrops of this group can be seen in a highly metamorphosed belt that extends from the Panamint Mountains to the eastern part of the Kingston Range, including an area near the Ashford Mill site.

Uplift eventually exposed the crystalline complex to erosion. Arkose conglomerate and mudstone of the lower Crystal Spring Formation were formed from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa aulacogen slowly subsided; thick sequences of lime-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called stromatolites were then laid down. Dolomite and limestone resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the algal mat, forming siltstone and sandstone. Laterally extensive diabase sills of molten rock later intruded above and below the carbonate rock layers; commercial grade talc was formed from thermal decay of carbonate rock at its contact with the lowest sill, which covers hundreds of square miles (many hundreds of km2). Today the formation is thick.

The Death Valley region once again rose above sea level, resulting in erosion. The Amargosa aulacogen then slowly sank beneath the seas; a sequence of carbonate banks that were topped by algal mats of stromatolites were laid on top of its eroded surface. Eventually these sediments and fossils became the Beck Spring Formation, which is thick.

Another round of uplift exposed the Beck Spring rocks and the underlying Crystal Spring to erosion; subsequent faster subsidence of the Amargosa aulacogen broke these formations into islands in later Proterozoic time. The resulting large sequence of thick conglomerate beds of pebbles and boulders in a sandy and muddy matrix that blanketed basins between higher areas is known as the Kingston Peak Formation. This formation is prominent near Wildrose, Harrisburg Flats, and Butte Valley and is thick.

Part of the Kingston Peak resembles glacial till by being poorly sorted and other parts have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a fine-grained matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world at that time was affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows.

A new rift opened that started to break apart the supercontinent Rodinia, of which North America was then a part. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States, with coastal lowlands and a wide, shallow shelf but no volcanoes, lay to the east near where Las Vegas now resides.

The first formation to be deposited in this setting was the Noonday Dolomite, which was formed from an algal mat-covered carbonate bank. Today it is up to thick and is a pale yellowish-gray cliff-former. The area subsided as the continental crust thinned and the new ocean widened; the carbonate bank soon became covered by thin beds of silt and layers of lime-rich ooze. These sediments in time hardened to become the siltstone and limestone of the Ibex Formation. A good outcrop of both the Noonday and overlying Ibex formations can be seen just east of the Ashford Mill Site.

An angular unconformity truncates progressively older (lower) parts of the underlying Pahrump Group starting in the southern part of the area and moving north. At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.

== Passive margin formed ==

As the incipient ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, it broke the continental crust in two and a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the two halves of the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate at the base of the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.

Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. They are, from oldest to youngest:
* Johnnie Formation (varicolored shaly),
* Stirling Quartzite,
* Wood Canyon Formation, and the
* Zabriskie Quartzite.
Together the Stirling, Wood Canyon, and Zabriskie units are about thick and are made of well-cemented sandstones and conglomerates. They also contain the region&#x27;s first known fossils of complex life: Ediacara fauna, trilobites, archaeocyathas, and primitive echinoderm burrows have been found in the Wood Canyon Formation. The very earliest animals are exceedingly rare, occurring well west of Death Valley in lime-rich offshore muds contemporary to the Stirling Quartzite. Good outcrops of these formations are exposed on the north face of Tucki Mountain in the northern Panamint Mountains.

The side road to Aguereberry Point successively traverses the shaly Johnnie Formation, the white Stirling Quartzite, and dark quartzites of the Wood Canyon Formation; at the Point itself is the great light-colored band of Zabriskie Quartzite dipping away toward Death Valley. Prominent outcrops are located between Death Valley Buttes and Daylight Pass, in upper Echo Canyon, and just west of Mare Spring in Titus Canyon. Before tilting to their present orientation, these four formations were a continuous pile of mud and sand deep that accumulated slowly on the nearshore ocean bottom.

== A carbonate shelf forms ==
A carbonate shelf started to develop over the sandy mudflats early in Paleozoic time. Sediment accumulated on the new but slowly subsiding continental shelf all through the Paleozoic and into the Early Mesozoic. Erosion had so subdued nearby parts of the continent that rivers ran clear, no longer supplying abundant sand and silt to the continental shelf. At the time, the Death Valley area was within ten or twenty degrees of the Paleozoic equator. So the combination of a warm sunlit climate and clear mud-free waters promoted prolific production of biotic (from life) carbonates. Thick beds of carbonate-rich sediments were periodically interrupted by periods of emergence, forming the (in order of deposition);
* Carrara Formation,
* Bonanza King Formation,
* Nopah Formation, and the
* Pogonip Group.
These sediments were lithified into limestone and dolomite after they were buried and compacted by yet more sediment. Thickest of these units is the dolomitic Bonanza King Formation, which forms the dark and light banded lower slopes of Pyramid Peak and the gorges of Titus and Grotto Canyons.

An intervening period occurred in the Late Ordovician (about 450 Ma) when a sheet of quartz-rich sand blanketed a large part of the continent after the above-mentioned units were laid down. The sand later hardened into sandstone and later still metamorphosed into the thick Eureka Quartzite. This great white band of Ordovician rock stands out on the summit of Pyramid Peak, near the Racetrack, and high on the east shoulder of Tucki Mountain. No American source is known for the Eureka sand, which once blanketed a belt from California to Alberta. It may have been swept southward by longshore currents from an eroding sandstone terrain in Canada.

Deposition of carbonate sediments resumed and continued into the Triassic. Four formations were deposited during this time (from oldest to youngest);
* Ely Springs Dolomite,
* Hidden Valley Dolomite,
* Lost Burro Formation, and the
* Tin Mountain Limestone.
The other period of interruption occurred between 350 and 250 Ma when sporadic pulses of mud swept southward into the Death Valley region during the erosion of highlands in north-central Nevada.

Although details of geography varied during this immense interval of time, a north-northeasterly trending coastline generally ran from Arizona up through Utah. A marine carbonate platform only tens of feet deep but more than wide stretched westward to a fringing rim of offshore reefs. Lime-rich mud and sand eroded by storm waves from the reefs and the platform collected on the quieter ocean floor at depths of or so. The Death Valley area&#x27;s carbonates appear to represent all three environments (down-slope basin, reef, and back-reef platform) owing to movement through time of the reef-line itself.

All told, these eight formations and one group are thick and are buried below much of the Cottonwood, Funeral, Grapevine, and Panamint ranges. Good outcrops can be seen in the southern Funeral Mountains outside the park and in Butte Valley within park borders. The Eureka Quartzite appears as a relatively thin, nearly white band with the grayish Pogonip Group below and the almost black Ely Springs Dolomite above. All strata are often vertically displaced by normal faulting.

== Change to active margin and uplift ==
The western edge of the North American continent was later pushed against the oceanic plate under the adjacent ocean. An area of great compression called a subduction zone was formed in the early-to-mid Mesozoic, which replaced the quiet, sea-covered continental margin with erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains. A chain of volcanoes pushed through the continental crust parallel to the deep trench, fed by magma rising from the subducting oceanic plate as it entered the Earth&#x27;s hot interior. Thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) of lavas erupted, pushing the ocean over to the west.

Compressive forces built up along the entire length of the broad continental shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably producing the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.
The plutons in the park are Jurassic and Cretaceous aged and are located toward the park&#x27;s western margin where they can be seen from unimproved roads. One of these relatively small granitic plutons was emplaced 67–87 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable precious metal deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of Skidoo. In the Death Valley area these solidified blobs of magma are located under much of the Owlshead Mountains and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak in the southern part of the Funeral Mountains.

A long period of uplift and erosion was concurrent with and followed the above events, producing a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.

== Development of a plain ==
After 150 million years of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust faulting had run their course, the early part of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 65–30 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was formed from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.

Large volcanic eruptions, originating near the Nevada Test Site, covered the Death Valley area and much of Nevada in thick sequences of silica-rich ash 27 million years ago. The ash has a rhyolitic composition, which is the volcanic equivalent of the plutonic rock granite; it covered what would later become the Grapevine Mountains in of ash. This ash filled in valleys and depressions; by 20 million years ago, the region from the Death Valley area across Nevada was a volcanic plain.

== Extension produces the Basin and Range ==

Starting around 16 Ma in Miocene time and continuing into the present, a large part of the North American Plate in the region has been under extension by literally being pulled apart. Debate still surrounds the cause of this crustal stretching, but an increasingly popular idea among geologists called the slab gap hypothesis states that the spreading zone of the subducted Farallon Plate is pushing the continent apart. Whatever the cause, the result has been the formation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years. Geologists call this region the Basin and Range Province.

Extensional forces causes rock at depth to stretch like silly putty and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called grabens; small mountain ranges known as horsts run parallel to each other on either side of the graben. Normally the number of horsts and grabens is limited, but in the Basin and Range region there are dozens of horst/graben structures, each roughly north–south trending. A succession of these extend from immediately east of the Sierra Nevada, through almost all of Nevada, and into western Utah and southern Idaho. The crust in the Death Valley region between Lake Mead and the southern Sierra Nevada has been extended by as much as .
The Furnace Creek Fault system, located in what is now the northern part of Death Valley, started to move about 14 Ma and the Southern Death Valley Fault system likely began to move by 12 million years ago. Both fault systems move with a right-lateral, or dextral, offset along strike-slip faults. With such faults, the opposite side of the fault appears to be moving right when facing the fault from either side. Both fault systems run parallel to and at the base of the ranges. Very often the same faults move laterally and vertically, simultaneously making them strike-slip &quot;and&quot; normal (i.e. oblique-slip). These two systems are also offset from each other; the area between the offset is thus put under enormous oblique tension, which intensifies subsidence there; Furnace Creek Basin opened in this area and the rest of Death Valley followed in stages. One of the last stages was the formation of Badwater Basin, which occurred by about 4 Ma. Data from gravimeters show that Death Valley&#x27;s bedrock floor tilts down toward the east and is deepest under Badwater Basin; there is of fill under Badwater. By about 2 Ma Death Valley, Panamint Valley and their associated ranges were formed.

Much of the extra local stretching in Death Valley that is responsible for its lower depth and wider valley floor is caused by &quot;left&quot; lateral strike-slip movement along the Garlock Fault south of the park (the Garlock Fault separates the Sierra Nevada range from the Mojave Desert). This particular fault is pulling the Panamint Range westward, causing the Death Valley graben to slip downward along the Furnace Creek Fault system at the foot of the Black Mountains. The rocks that would become the Panamint Range may have been stacked on top of the rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Under this interpretation, as the Black Mountains began to rise, the Panamint/Cottonwood Mountains slid westward off of them along low-angle normal faults, and starting around 6 Ma, the Cottonwood Mountains slid northwest off the top of the Panamint Range. There is also some evidence that the Grapevine Mountains may have slid off the Funeral Mountains. Another interpretation of the evidence is that the Black and Panamint Mountains were once side by side and were pulled apart along normal faults. These normal faults, in this view, are steep near the surface but become low angle at depth; the mountain blocks rotated as they slid to produce the tilted mountains seen today.

Total movement of the Pamamint block between the Garlock and Furnace Creek Faults is to the northwest, giving birth to Death Valley in the process. A few of the 20 to 25 degree-sloped surfaces along which this mass of of rock slipped, are exposed in Death Valley. These features are called &quot;turtlebacks&quot; due to their turtle shell-like appearance.

== Volcanism and valley-fill sedimentation ==
Igneous activity associated with the extension occurred from 12 to 4 Ma. Both intrusive (plutonic/solidified underground) and extrusive (volcanic/solidified above ground) igneous rocks were produced. Basaltic magma followed fault lines to the surface and erupted as cinder cones and lava flows. Some volcanic rocks were re-worked by hydrothermal systems to form colorful rocks and concentrated mineral formations, such as boron-rich minerals like borax; a Pliocene-aged example is the -thick Artist Drive Formation. Gold and silver ores were also concentrated by mineralizing fluids from igneous intrusions. Other times, heat from magma migrating close to the surface would superheat overlaying groundwater until it exploded, not unlike an exploding pressure-cooker, forming blowout craters and tuff rings. One example of such a feature is the roughly 2000-year-old and deep Ubehebe Crater (photo) in the northern part of the park; nearby smaller craters may be less than 200 to 300 years old.

Sediment filled the subsiding Furnace Creek Basin as the area was pulled apart by Basin and Range extension. The resulting -thick Furnace Creek Formation is made of lakebed sediments that consist of saline muds, gravels from nearby mountains and ash from the then-active Black Mountain volcanic field. Boron, which is abundant in this formation, is dissolved by ground water and flows out onto the northern end of the Death Valley playa. Today this formation is most-prominently exposed in the badlands at Zabriskie Point. Additional subsidence of the Furnace Creek Basin was filled by the four-million-year-old Funeral Formation, which consists of of conglomerates, sand, mud and volcanic material. Another smaller basin to the south was filled by the Copper Canyon Formation around the same time. Footprints and fossils of camels, horses, and mammoths are in all three of these Pliocene formations.

About 2–3 Ma, in the Pleistocene, continental ice sheets expanded from the polar regions of the globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).
Lake Manly was the lake that filled Death Valley during each glacial period from at least 240,000 years ago to as late as 10,500 years ago; the lake typically dried up during each interglacial period, such as the current one. Lake Manly was the last in a chain of lakes that were fed by the Amargosa and Mojave Rivers, and possibly also the Owens River; it was also the lowest point in the Great Basin drainage system. At its height during the Last glacial period some 22,000 years ago, water filled Lake Manly to form a body of water that may have been deep and long. Much smaller lakes filled parts of Death Valley during interglacials; the largest of these was deep and lasted from 5000 to 2000 years ago. Panamint Lake filled Panamint Valley to a maximum depth of ; when it was full, Panamint Lake overflowed into Lake Manly somewhere around the southern end of the Panamint Mountains.

Lake Manly and its sister lakes started to dry up about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes disappeared and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.

Stream gradients increased on flanking mountain ranges as they were uplifted. These swifter moving streams are dry most of the year but have nevertheless cut true river valleys, canyons, and gorges that face Death and Panamint valleys. In this arid environment, alluvial fans form at the mouth of these streams. Very large alluvial fans merged to form continuous alluvial slopes called &quot;bajadas&quot; along the Panamint Range. The faster uplift along the Black Mountains formed much smaller alluvial fans because older fans are buried under playa sediments before they can grow too large. Slot canyons are often found at the mouths of the streams that feed the fans, and the slot canyons in turn are topped by V-shaped gorges. This forms what looks like a wineglass shape to some people, thus giving them their names, &quot;wineglass canyons&quot;.

==Formation of the Walker Lane==

The Quaternary tectonics of the Death Valley area show the increasing impact of right-lateral strike-slip faulting. Death Valley itself is currently an active pull-apart basin developed between the Northern and Southern Death Valley Faults, with mainly normal faulting along the Black Mountains Fault zone between these two major strike-slip fault zones. These faults form part of a broader zone of faulting that extends between the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada just across the border into Nevada, part of the southern Walker Lane (also described as the northern part of the Eastern California Shear Zone). The Walker Lane currently accommodates a significant part of the plate boundary motion between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate and it has been proposed that this proportion will increase over time, with this zone eventually becoming the site of the plate boundary, accompanied by abandonment of the San Andreas Fault. However, there are currently no right-lateral strike-slip faults that pass through the Garlock Fault at the southern end of this zone, suggesting that this change will not occur for several million of years at the earliest.

According to GPS data, the southern part of the Walker Lane accommodates 9–12 mm per year of right lateral shear. Only about half of this amount can be explained by movement on the main fault zones, with the remainder being distributed on smaller, less well-defined structures. There have been no historical earthquakes in the Death Valley area, but major earthquakes have occurred on other faults within the southern Walker Lane, such as the M7.4 1872 Owens Valley earthquake on the Owens Valley Fault and the M7.1 mainshock of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes, which was a result of movement on previously unmapped NW-SE trending right lateral strike-slip fault strands, close to the Little Lake and Airport Lake faults. Holocene ruptures have been identified on most of the major faults in the area.

<text>Filippo de Lurano (also Luprano, or Lorano) (c. 1475 – after 1520) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance. He was one of the most prolific composers of frottola after Marchetto Cara and Bartolomeo Tromboncino.

==Biography==
Of his early life, almost nothing is known: the few sources we have range from attributing his birthplace to the Istrian peninsula to Lurano, which at the time was under the diocese of Cremona, to Cremona itself. He appears in the records of Cividale del Friuli&#x27;s Cathedral, near Udine, as a cleric. De Lurano spent time in Rome in the first decade of the 16th century, but the exact years are not known; he wrote music for a wedding of the niece of Pope Julius II in 1508. From 1512 to 1515 he was employed as &quot;maestro de cappella&quot; of Cividale Cathedral, and shortly afterwards moved to Aquileia, where he may have died.

==Works==
Most of his music is in the light secular form of the frottola, an ancestor of the madrigal. 35 of his frottole survive, along with two motets and a lauda. Stylistically they are typical of the time: homophonic texture predominates, with brief imitative passages at phrase beginnings; the melodies are memorable and easily singable. 
One of his frottola was evidently the favorite song of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, according to a manuscript source of the time.

<doc id="1134154" wikidata="Q510181" url="?curid=1134154" title="In the Realm of the Senses">
<text>In the Realm of the Senses (, Japanese: , &quot;Ai no Korīda&quot;, &quot;Bullfight of Love&quot;) is a 1976 erotic art film written and directed by Nagisa Ōshima. It is a fictionalised and sexually explicit treatment of a 1936 murder committed by Sada Abe. An international coproduction of France and Japan, the film generated great controversy at the time of its release. The film had the involvement of pink film luminary Kōji Wakamatsu as co-screenwriter and assistant producer. While intended for mainstream wide release, the film contains scenes of unsimulated sexual activity between the actors (Eiko Matsuda and Tatsuya Fuji, among others).

==Plot==
In 1936 Tokyo, Sada Abe is a former prostitute who now works as a maid in a hotel. The hotel&#x27;s owner, Kichizo Ishida, initiates an intense affair that consists of sexual experiments and various self-indulgences. Ishida leaves his wife to pursue his affair with Sada. Sada becomes increasingly possessive and jealous of Ishida, and Ishida more eager to please her. Their mutual obsession escalates until Ishida finds that she is most excited by strangling him during lovemaking, and he is killed in this fashion. Sada then severs his penis. While she is shown next to him naked, it is mentioned that she will walk around with his organ for four days before being arrested while smiling radiantly. Words written with blood can be read on his chest: &quot;Sada Kichi the two of us forever.&quot;

== Themes ==
The film explores themes of sexual obsession, power dynamics, and the blurred lines between violence and love, representing extreme consequences of resistance to social repression.

==Cast==
==Title==
The film was released under the title of &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; in the U.S. and the U.K., and under &quot;L&#x27;Empire des sens&quot; (&quot;Empire of the Senses&quot;) in France. The French title was taken from Roland Barthes&#x27;s book about Japan, &quot;L&#x27;Empire des signes&quot; (&quot;Empire of Signs&quot;, 1970).

The original Japanese title &quot;Ai no Korīda&quot; was later reimagined as the title of the 1979 funk song &quot;Ai No Corrida&quot;, originally recorded by Chaz Jankel and later brought to success by Quincy Jones in 1981.

==Censorship==
Strict censorship laws in Japan would not have allowed the film to be made according to Ōshima&#x27;s vision. This obstruction was bypassed by officially listing the production as a French enterprise, and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for processing and editing. At its premiere in Japan, the film&#x27;s sexual activity was optically censored using reframing and blurring. A book with stills and script notes from the film was published by San’ichishobo, and in 1976 the Japanese government brought obscenity charges against Ōshima and San’ichishobo. Ōshima testified in the trial and said. &quot;Nothing that is expressed is obscene. What is obscene is what is hidden.&quot; Ōshima and the publisher were found not guilty in 1979; the government appealed and the Tokyo High Court upheld the verdict in 1982.

In the United States, the film was initially banned upon its premiere at the 1976 New York Film Festival but was later screened uncut, and a similar fate awaited the film when it was released in West Germany. It was also banned because of a scene in which Kichi pushes an egg into Sada&#x27;s vagina, forcing her to push it out before Kichi eats the egg. The film was not available on home video until 1990, although it was sometimes seen uncut in film clubs.

At the time, the only European country in which the film was banned was Belgium. The ban was lifted in 1994, and Belgium has not censored a film of any kind since.

At the time of its initial screening at the 1976 London Film Festival, the British Board of Film Censors recommended that it be shown under private cinema club conditions to avoid the need for heavy cuts, but only after the Obscene Publications Act had been extended to films in 1977 to avoid potential legal problems. The film opened at the Gate Cinema Club in 1978. It was given an official countrywide cinema release in 1991, though the video release was delayed until 2000 when it was passed with an &quot;18&quot; certificate (suitable for adults only). All of the adult sexual activity was left intact, but a shot in which Sada yanks the penis of a prepubescent boy after he misbehaves was reframed, zooming in so that only the reaction of the boy was shown. In Australia, the film was originally banned, but a censored version was made available in 1977. In 2000, it finally became available in its complete version. The graphic sexual content of the production also caused it to be banned in Israel in 1987.

The film is available in uncut form in France, Germany, the United States (as part of The Criterion Collection), the Netherlands, Belgium and several other territories.

In Canada, when originally submitted to the provincial film boards in the 1970s, the film was rejected in all jurisdictions except Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia. It was not until 1991 that individual provinces approved the film and gave it a . However, in the Maritimes, the film was rejected again as the policies followed in the 1970s were still enforced.

In Brazil, the film was banned during the military dictatorship due to its explicit sex scenes. The ban was lifted in 1980.

Due to its sexual themes and explicit scenes, the film was the cause of great controversy in Portugal in 1991 after it aired on RTP. Some deemed it inappropriate even for the watershed slot, while others appreciated its airing. The film aired again on RTP2, almost unnoticed.

==Box office==
In France, the film sold 1,730,874 tickets, grossing approximately ($5,203,732). In Germany, where it was released in 1978, the film sold 693,628 tickets, grossing approximately ($2,446,050). Combined, the film sold 2,424,502 tickets and grossed approximately in France and Germany.

== Critical reception ==
On the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Boxoffice&quot; wrote: &quot;Oshima has handled some delicate themes in his past films and it is obvious here that he is attempting to make a bold statement, but what could have been a breakthrough in presenting explicit sex within a serious context quickly deteriorates into a very dull film.&quot;

In a 2009 retrospective review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw gave the film 5/5 stars, writing: &quot;This uncompromising film has not dated one iota, perhaps because films that are really about sex are still such a rarity, despite the supposed sexiness of everything that surrounds us. ... Oshima&#x27;s film widens and deepens the sensual realm.&quot;

In 2012 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; wrote: &quot;Thirty-six years on, &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; is still startlingly confrontational, the unambiguously unsimulated sex scenes staged with an acute awareness of their participants&#x27; inner psychology in a way that conventional porn doesn&#x27;t just omit but actively shuns. At a time (the mid-1930s) when Japanese foreign policy was becoming aggressively externalised, the lovers Sada and Kichi try to achieve both total privacy and perfect sexual fusion, constantly under the scrutiny of numerous onscreen voyeurs and, even when ostensibly closeted away from prying eyes, the film&#x27;s own audience. In a way that Bishop Berkeley would undoubtedly recognise, the private is permanently public.&quot;

&quot;Empire&quot; wrote: &quot;Argued by some to be a serious exploration of the connection between death and eroticism, and by others to be a particularly repellent piece of pornography, &quot;Ai No Corrida&quot; is an undeniably powerful, stylish and impressive piece of work.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 86% based on 36 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.7 out of 10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Sexual taboos are broken and boundaries crossed &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;, a fearlessly provocative psychosexual tale.&quot;

<doc id="1134155" wikidata="Q645574" url="?curid=1134155" title="The Misfits (1961 film)">
<text>The Misfits is a 1961 American contemporary Western film directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, who adapted his own 1957 short story. It stars Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, and Montgomery Clift, alongside Thelma Ritter and Eli Wallach. The plot centers on a newly divorced woman (Monroe), and her relationships with a friendly landlady (Ritter), an old-school cowboy (Gable), his tow-truck driving and plane-flying best friend (Wallach), and their rodeo-riding, bronc-busting friend (Clift). &quot;The Misfits&quot; was the last completed film for both Gable (who died three months before the premiere) and Monroe (who died a year after its release).

&quot;The Misfits&quot; was released by United Artists on February 1, 1961. It was a commercial failure, but received critical acclaim for its script and performances. Its reputation has enhanced over the years, and many critics now consider it to be a masterpiece and one of the best films of the 1960s. The film also gave name to the punk band Misfits formed in 1977.

==Plot==
In Reno, Nevada, 30-year-old Roslyn Tabor files for a quickie six-week residency divorce from her inattentive husband, Raymond. Afterward, Roslyn&#x27;s landlady Isabelle takes her to a cocktail lounge at Harrah&#x27;s for drinks. They meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord Langland, and his tow truck driver best friend, Guido. The friendly Guido tells Roslyn and Isabelle about his unfinished house in the country. Later that day, the group goes to the unfinished house Guido has built for his late wife. After drinking and dancing, Roslyn has had too much to drink, so Gaylord drives her home to Reno.

Eventually, Roslyn and Gaylord move into Guido&#x27;s half-finished house and work on it. One day, Gaylord tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his children, whom he has not seen for years. Later, he discovers rabbits have been eating the lettuce in the garden they have planted. Gay wants to kill the rabbits with his shotgun, an idea that Roslyn opposes.

When Guido and Isabelle show up, Guido suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They go to a local rodeo in Dayton to hire a third man. They run into Perce Howland, a cowboy friend of Gaylord&#x27;s, who wants to compete in the rodeo. Gaylord offers to pay the broke Perce&#x27;s $10 entry fee if he will help round up mustangs the next day. Guido, Perce, Roslyn and Gaylord go to a bar and nearly get into a fistfight when a drunk spanks Roslyn&#x27;s bottom.

At the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap. Perce is thrown by a bucking horse, and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, but he insists on riding a bull he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, sustaining a head injury.

Later, he passes out in a Dayton back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to. He tells her how his mother changed after his father died, giving his stepfather the ranch Perce&#x27;s father wanted to leave to Perce. A drunken Gaylord then fetches Roslyn, telling her that he wants her to meet his kids, claiming he unexpectedly ran into them. When Gaylord discovers his children have already left Dayton, he causes a public scene.

Later on, during the drive home, a drunken Guido asks if Roslyn has left Gaylord and offers to take his place. Back at Guido&#x27;s house, Guido attempts to finish the patio he started. Later, Gaylord asks Roslyn if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue.

The next day, Gaylord, Guido and Perce go after the mustangs, with Roslyn reluctantly tagging along. Roslyn becomes upset when she learns that they will be slaughtered for dog food. Gaylord tells Roslyn that he did things for her that he never did for any other woman, such as making the house a home and planting the garden. After they catch a stallion and four mares, Roslyn begs Gaylord to release the horses. He considers it, but when she offers to pay him $200, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would release them if she would leave Gaylord for him. She rebuffs him. Perce asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight. Perce frees the stallion anyway. After Gaylord chases down and subdues it by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. As they are driving away in Gaylord&#x27;s truck, Roslyn tells Gaylord that she will leave the next day. He stops the truck to pick up his dog and watches her joyfully untethering him. They realize that they still love each other and drive off into the night.

==Cast==
==Production==

The making of &quot;The Misfits&quot; was troublesome on several accounts, not the least of which was the sometimes 100 °F (38 °C) heat of the northern Nevada desert and the breakdown of Monroe&#x27;s marriage to writer Arthur Miller. Miller revised the script throughout the shoot as the concepts of the film developed.

Meanwhile, with her marriage to Arthur Miller troubled, Marilyn Monroe was drinking too much after work and using prescription drugs. According to Huston in a 1981 retrospective interview, he felt &quot;absolutely certain that she was doomed,&quot; a conclusion he reached while working on the film: &quot;There was evidence right before me almost every day. She was incapable of rescuing herself or of being rescued by anyone else. And it sometimes affected her work. We had to stop the picture while she went to a hospital for two weeks.&quot; Huston shut down production in August 1960 when Monroe went to a hospital for relaxation and depression treatment. Some close-ups after her hospital discharge were shot using limited soft focus. Monroe was nearly always an hour late to the set, sometimes not showing up at all. Monroe spent her nights learning newly written lines with her drama coach Paula Strasberg. Monroe&#x27;s confidant and masseur, Ralph Roberts, was cast as an ambulance attendant in the film&#x27;s rodeo scene. The other actors and Huston did not complain to Monroe about her lateness—they knew they needed her to finish the movie. Gable reminisced with &quot;The Making of the Misfits&quot; author James Goode saying, &quot;Long ago, if an actor was late, they were fired.&quot;

Clark Gable insisted on doing some of his own stunts, but not the scene of being dragged across the dry lake bed at more than . Director John Huston said after Gable&#x27;s death he would never have allowed Gable to do the more dangerous mustang stunts.

Veteran B-movie Western actor Rex Bell, who had been married to Clara Bow, made his final film appearance in a brief cameo as an amusing elderly cowboy. Bell was lieutenant governor of Nevada at the time.

Thomas B. Allen was assigned to create drawings of &quot;The Misfits&quot; as the film was made. Magnum Photos had numerous staff photographers, including Ernst Haas, Inge Morath, and Eve Arnold assigned to document the making of &quot;The Misfits&quot;. Inge Morath later married Arthur Miller, Monroe&#x27;s former husband, a year after the film was released.

During production, the cast&#x27;s principals stayed at the now imploded Mapes Hotel in Reno. Film locations included the Washoe County Court House on Virginia Street, and Quail Canyon, near Pyramid Lake. The bar scene wherein Monroe plays paddle ball and the rodeo scenes were filmed in Dayton, Nevada, east of Carson City. For the final three weeks of shooting, Miller and Monroe moved to the nearby Holiday Hotel and Casino, now the Renaissance Hotel, on Center Street in Reno. The Renaissance Hotel no longer has a casino. The climax of the film takes place during wrangling scenes on a Nevada dry lake twelve miles east of Dayton, near Stagecoach. The area today is known as &quot;Misfits Flat&quot;.

Filming was completed on November 4, 1960, twelve days before Clark Gable&#x27;s death, and &quot;The Misfits&quot; was released on February 1, 1961, on what would have been Gable&#x27;s 60th birthday.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Misfits&quot; failed to meet expectations at the box office and has been historically referred to as a &quot;box office disaster&quot; of its day. Despite being shot in black and white, the final cost was about $4 million, which was the estimated budget. The film grossed $4,100,000 in its initial USA release.

===Critical reception===

Despite on-set difficulties, Gable, Monroe, Clift and Wallach delivered performances that modern critics consider superb. Many critics regard Gable&#x27;s performance as his finest, and Gable, after seeing the rough cuts, agreed. Monroe received the 1961 Golden Globe Award as &quot;World Film Favorite&quot; in March 1962, five months before her death. Huston was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film. In 2005, the film was nominated by the American Film Institute in the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores list.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 31 critics have given &quot;The Misfits&quot; a positive review, with an average rating of 8.1/10. In later years, the film came to be described as a cult classic. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film is one of the films that &quot;marked a turning point in the cinema, influencing directors, actors, and audiences.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Gable suffered a heart attack two days after filming ended and died ten days later on November 16, 1960. Monroe and Clift attended the premiere in New York in February 1961, while Arthur Miller attended with his two children. Monroe later said that she hated the film and her performance in it. Within a year and a half, she was dead of an apparent drug overdose. &quot;The Misfits&quot; was the last completed film for both Monroe and Gable, her childhood screen idol. In her last interview, Monroe, who never knew her father, said she often fantasized that Gable was her father. Montgomery Clift died five years later, and made only three more movies.

The documentary &quot;The Legend of Marilyn Monroe&quot; (1966) includes footage shot while &quot;The Misfits&quot; was being made. Miller&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Timebends&quot; (1987) described the making of the film. The 2001 PBS documentary &quot;Making The Misfits&quot; did the same. Primary sources such as &quot;The Making of the Misfits&quot; by James Goode, &quot;Conversations with Marilyn&quot; by W.J. Weatherby, and Miller&#x27;s account, particularly his assertion that &quot;The Misfits&quot; script was a &quot;valentine&quot; for Monroe, inspired the docu-drama play &quot;Misfits&quot; by Alex Finlayson, which was commissioned by director Greg Hersov. &quot;Misfits&quot; premiered at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, UK in 1996, directed by Hersov and starring Lisa Eichhorn as Marilyn Monroe.

Arthur Miller&#x27;s last play &quot;Finishing the Picture&quot; (2004), although fiction, was based on the events involved in the making of &quot;The Misfits&quot;.

===Discovered scene===
In August 2018, an unreleased nude scene where Marilyn Monroe exposes herself while making love with Clark Gable&#x27;s character, and which was thought to have been lost, was discovered.

==Home media==
&quot;The Misfits&quot; was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on May 8, 2012 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and on May 10, 2011 on Blu-ray.

<text>The University of Central Arkansas (Central Arkansas or UCA) is a public university in Conway, Arkansas, United States. Founded in 1907, the university is one of the oldest in the state. As the state&#x27;s only normal school at the time, UCA has historically been the primary source of teachers in Arkansas. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. 

The university comprises five colleges, five residential colleges and one commuter college. UCA has about 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the state. The university maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of approximately 17 to 1. Over 150 undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs are offered at the university. UCA occupies over 120 buildings within its .

==History==

The Arkansas State Legislature created the Arkansas State Normal School, now known as the University of Central Arkansas, in 1907 by passage of Act 317 on May 14. The purpose of The Arkansas State Normal School was to properly train students to become professional teachers and centralize teacher training. Classes began September 21, 1908, with nine academic departments, one building on , 107 students and seven faculty members. Two faculty members taught in two departments and President Doyne taught pedagogy and Latin.

In 1925, Arkansas State Normal School became Arkansas State Teachers College. The name change more accurately reflected the primary focus of instruction and mission of the institution.

By 1967, the mission of Arkansas State Teachers College had changed. Though teacher training was still an important part of the school&#x27;s mission, other fields began to expand in liberal arts studies and in the emerging field of health care. To recognize the institution&#x27;s existing academic diversity another name change was in order. In January 1967, Arkansas State Teachers College became the State College of Arkansas.

President Silas Snow, who championed the name change in 1967, organized State College of Arkansas along university lines in preparation for still yet another name change. State College of Arkansas grew rapidly and offered an ever-widening range of degree programs. By January 1975, Snow&#x27;s efforts were realized as the State Department of Higher Education recommended State College of Arkansas be known as The University of Central Arkansas, or UCA.

Retention for full-time, first-time undergraduates increased from 72.4 percent from fall 2014 to 72.9 percent from fall 2015. Graduate student enrollment is 1,872, while last year the number was 1,867 and the number of transfer students increased to 775 compared to 618 last year.

==Traditions==
===Colors===
The colors for UCA were decided the first year and according to an article in the November 24, 1908, edition of the Log Cabin Democrat, were said to be purple and silver. President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray.

===Mascot===
The UCA athletic teams first had a mascot in 1920. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920, the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, the teams were called the &quot;Bears&quot; in print until April 7, 1921. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas&#x27; nickname was the &quot;Bear State&quot;. The women&#x27;s teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006.

===Main Hall===
UCA&#x27;s Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas. After the building was built it served a dual role as the administration building and as a classroom building. It continued to serve as the administration building until the 1960s. On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the National Register of Historic Places.

===World War II Marker===
UCA&#x27;s World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003. The memorial contains the names and branch of service of forty-six UCA alumni who were killed during World War II. The memorial is seen as a permanent reminder of those UCA alumni who lost their lives during the conflict.

===2008 shooting===
On Sunday, October 26, 2008, a shooting took place on the UCA campus shortly after 9:00pm CDT. Two students were fatally shot. A third person, a non-student visiting the campus, was shot in the leg and treated at the nearby Conway Regional Medical Center. UCA Police Department arrested four suspects in the shooting. All four subsequently pleaded guilty.

===Senior Legacy Walk Brick Campaign===
The Senior Walk is located in the courtyard in front of the Student Center. Each year, graduates will have the opportunity to purchase bricks as part of their class year. For $100, graduates can purchase a brick that will be inscribed with his/her name or the name of a graduate that a purchaser wants to honor.

<text>Posterization or posterisation of an image is the conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, causing abrupt changes from one tone to another. This was originally done with photographic processes to create posters. It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing, and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of color quantization. Posterization is often the first step in vectorization (tracing) of an image.

==Cause==
The effect may be created deliberately, or happen accidentally. For artistic effect, most image editing programs provide a posterization feature, or photographic processes may be used. 

Unwanted posterization, also known as banding, may occur when the color depth, sometimes called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color — hence the name. When discussing fixed pixel displays, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring. Additionally, compression in image formats such as JPEG can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an optical illusion, called the Mach band illusion, in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with dithering.

== Photographic process ==
Posterization is a process in photograph development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing posterization from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.

== Applications ==
Typically, posterization is used for tracing contour lines and vectorizing photo-realistic images. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and advances to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increase, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases.

A visual artist, faced with line art that has been damaged through JPEG compression, may consider posterizing the image as a first step to remove artifacts on the edges of the image.

==Posterizing time ==
Temporal posterization is the visual effect of reducing the number of frames of video, while not reducing the total time it takes the video to play. This compares to regular posterization, where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not. The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light, but without the contrast of bright and dark. Unlike a pulldown, the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the persistence of vision that video and motion pictures normally depend on). An animated GIF often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate.

More formally, this is downsampling in the time dimension, as it is reducing the resolution (precision of the &quot;input&quot;), not the bit rate (precision of the &quot;output,&quot; as in posterization).

The resulting stop-go motion is a temporal form of jaggies; formally, a form of aliasing. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use temporal anti-aliasing, which yields motion blur.

Compare with time stretching, which &quot;adds&quot; frames.

<doc id="1134177" wikidata="Q3146458" url="?curid=1134177" title="I-number">
<text>i-numbers are a type of Internet identifier designed to solve the problem of how any web resource can have a persistent identity that never changes even when the web resource moves or changes its human-friendly name. For example, if a web page has an i-number, and links to that page use the i-number, then those links will not break even if the page is renamed, the website containing the page is completely reorganized, or the page is moved to another website.

Conceptually, an i-number is similar to an IP address, except i-numbers operate at a much higher level of abstraction in Internet addressing architecture. The other key difference is that i-numbers are persistent, i.e., once they are assigned to a resource, they are never reassigned. By contrast, IP addresses are constantly reassigned, e.g., your computer may have a different IP address every time it connects to the Internet.

Technically, an i-number is one form of an extensible resource identifier (XRI) — an abstract structured identifier standard developed at the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards for sharing resources and data across domains and applications. The other form is called an i-name.

The i-number form of an XRI is designed to serve as an address that does not need to change no matter how often the location of a resource on (or off) the Internet changes. XRIs accomplish this by adding a third layer of abstract addressing over the existing layers: IP numbering (first layer) and DNS naming (second layer). The notion of a third layer for persistent addressing is not new — Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and other persistent identifier architectures have been developed for this purpose. However, the XRI layer is the first architecture that combines a uniform syntax and resolution protocol for both persistent and reassignable identifiers.

At the XRI addressing layer, most resources will have &quot;both&quot; i-names and i-numbers. These different XRIs that all point to the same resource are called &quot;synonyms&quot;. I-name synonyms make it easy for humans to discover and address the resource, while i-number synonyms make it easy for machines to maintain a persistent identity for the resource. For example, if a company changes its name, it may register a new i-name and sell its old i-name to another company, however, its i-number can remain the same — and links to the company that use its i-number won&#x27;t break.

Furthermore, all of these forms of XRI &quot;synonyms&quot; can be resolved using the same http- or https-based resolution protocol. The results of XRI resolution are an XML document called an XRDS (Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence). XRDS documents are the basis for the Yadis identity service discovery protocol that is now part of OpenID.

XRIs are also backwards compatible with the DNS and IP addressing systems, so it is possible for domain names and IP addresses to be used as i-names (or, in rare cases, as i-numbers). Like DNS names, XRIs can also be delegated, i.e., nested multiple levels deep, just like the directory names on a local computer file system. For example, a company can register a top-level (global) i-name and i-number for itself, and then assign second- or lower-level (community) i-names and i-numbers to its divisions, employees, etc.

== Examples ==
The following examples conform to the i-number specifications published in the XDI.org Global Services Specifications. Note that they do not include the &quot;&#x27;xri://&quot; prefix as this is optional with absolute XRIs.

<doc id="1134183" wikidata="Q16240762" url="?curid=1134183" title="Arrow Development">
<text>Arrow Development was an amusement park ride and roller coaster design and manufacturing company, incorporated in California on November 16, 1945, and based in Mountain View. It was founded by Angus &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, Karl Bacon, William Hardiman and Edgar Morgan. Originally located at 243 Moffett Boulevard, it moved to a larger facility at 1555 Plymouth Street after Walt Disney Productions purchased one third of the business in 1960. Arrow also had offices at 820 Huff Avenue.

By 1956, then secretary Bill Hardiman and Angus Anderson, then vice president, had sold their interests in Arrow to Wharton graduate Walter Schulze, who then became Arrow&#x27;s secretary-treasurer and vice president. Schulze and his wife had provided accounting services for several small companies in the Bay Area, including Duro-Bond Bearing, which is where he likely heard of Arrow. Schulze left Arrow after its sale to Rio Grande Industries. In 1979, Arrow listed over a dozen types of rides in their catalog, including 15 corkscrews, five looping coasters, 12 runaway mine trains, 43 flume rides, and 77 automotive rides, for a total of more than 200 rides installed at nearly 100 locations around the world.

Huss Trading Corporation purchased Arrow Development in 1981, but the combined Arrow-Huss went bankrupt in 1984. The similarly named Arrow Dynamics, eventual successor to Arrow Development, was incorporated in Delaware on January 10, 1986 by Ron Toomer, Otis Hughes, David Klomp, Ray Crandall and Brent Meikle.

==History==
===The early years (1945–1953)===

Andy, Bill, Ed and Karl met while working at the Hendy Iron Works in Sunnyvale, CA. The Hendy company had a contract with the US Navy to build torpedo launchers and marine steam engines. By 1942, Hendy was building hundreds of marine engines for Liberty ships. The number of employees increased to over 11,500 to meet demand. In June 1943, the union began enforcing a four-month ban on overtime, during which all machinists were to quit work after eight hours and refuse to work on Sundays. Hendy responded by announcing that all machinists who refused to work overtime would be discharged. Both Karl and Ed would recall later that being told to be on the picket line motivated them to start their own company.

Neither Bacon nor Morgan saw active duty in the military, although Ed and his younger brother Eugene enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Ed was given a deferment based on his employment at Hendy. Eugene was killed in action in the South Pacific on December 16, 1944, while serving with the 868th Bombardment Squadron, flying special radar equipped B-24 Liberators designed for secret night bombing and escort missions.

During the early years, Arrow Development sold used machine tools and made replacement parts for trucks, which were scarce after the war. Their first big job was building test run-in furnaces for the US Navy. They also performed machining and assembly work for Luscombe, Hewlett-Packard in the 1950s, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the 1960s. Arrow helped the NASA Ames Research Center develop 25 balloon-suspended capsules for high altitude research with monkeys, in preparation for the Mercury Program.

Morgan, Bacon, and Schulze are credited with building the carousel originally installed at Alum Rock Park in 1947.  By 1950, Arrow Development was known locally for its manufacture of carousels and other small amusement rides.

===Contributions to Disneyland and Walt Disney World===
Ed Morgan read a newspaper article about Disneyland and wrote to Disney about a small stern wheel paddle boat named “Lil’ Belle”, which Arrow had built in 1952. Disney wasn’t interested in the boat, but became interested in the vehicles that Arrow was creating for other amusement parks. Imagineer Bruce Bushman gave Ed Morgan a sketch of the &quot;Mr. Toad&quot; vehicle, and a prototype body was quickly fabricated. Morgan would later recall that Arrow landed their contract with Disney through the recommendation of Stanford Research Institute which did the site and population density research for Disneyland. Walt and Roy Disney had consulted with Harrison Price of SRI’s Los Angeles office on a proposal to build Disneyland in Burbank, California.

Between 1953 and 1971 Arrow would be instrumental in designing and developing over a dozen ride systems and vehicles for Disney and were awarded multiple patents for their designs. Six of the opening day rides at Disneyland were built by Arrow; Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White&#x27;s Scary Adventures.
Arrow went on to design and build vehicles and track systems for the Midget Autopia and Motorboat Cruise (1957), Alice in Wonderland (1958), the Matterhorn Bobsleds (1959), Flying Saucers (1961) and the Mark VI redesign of Autopia cars (1963). The tram cars which carried guests from the parking lot to the park&#x27;s entrance at Disneyland and Disney World were another Arrow Product. They also designed and built the ride systems for It&#x27;s a Small World (1964/66), Pirates of the Caribbean, Adventure Through Inner Space (1967), and the Haunted Mansion (1969). Arrow has also been credited for improving the guidance system for the Submarine Voyage (1959) and prototyping a four-track version of Space Mountain for Walt Disney World in Orlando.

Dana Morgan, the son of co-founder Ed Morgan, recalled that Arrow was involved in fourteen of the Walt Disney World attractions, including Dumbo the Flying Elephant and Peter Pan, Pirates of the Caribbean, the parking lot trams, Sky Buckets and the Prince Charming Carousel. The last ride system Arrow may have worked on for Walt Disney World would have been Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened November 15, 1980, two months before the merger with HUSS Maschinenfabrik which formed Arrow-Huss.

===Non-Disney rides===
The 1947 carousel at Alum Rock was later moved to the Happy Hollow Park &amp; Zoo in 1964, where it still operates as the King Neptune&#x27;s Carousel. Karl and Ed also set up a separate company called Easbey which won a contract with the city of Oakland, California, to install rides at the Children&#x27;s Fairyland at Lake Merritt, which was built in 1950. The Flecto Carousel was built by Arrow in 1950, although it was not installed at Fairyland until 2002.

In 1955, Arrow built a demonstration children&#x27;s park called Playtown, next to Palo Alto&#x27;s Town and Country Village Shopping Center, where they demonstrated new rides including a miniature train, boat, &quot;Arrow-plane,&quot; and carousel. They also had a demonstration park across the bay near San Leandro and another in Los Altos.

On August 21, 1960, a tragic accident occurred at Playtown involving the son of Frank Freidel, a visiting professor at Stanford, known for his extensive biography of Franklin Roosevelt. While Frank&#x27;s wife Madeleine was buying tickets for the miniature train ride, their year old son Phillip wandered off, sat down on the tracks and was hit by the train, suffering massive head and leg injuries. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. Playtown closed soon after.
Arrow developed the Mystery Island Banana Train ride for Pacific Ocean Park, which was one of the opening-day rides in 1958. Arrow also developed an extensive Alice in Wonderland ride for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which opened in 1961. For the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, Arrow created the &quot;Space Whirl&quot;, a teacup ride which simulated the feeling of being launched into space.

For Freedomland U.S.A., located in New York City from 1960 to 1964, Arrow created four dark rides (Earthquake, Buccaneer, Tornado and Mine Cave), Spin-A-Top (similar to Disneyland&#x27;s Mad Tea Party), horse-drawn street cars, antique cars (known as Horseless Carriage) and freeway cars for the Satellite City Turnpike. Arrow&#x27;s contributions to the park are documented in &quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot; published by Theme Park Press (2019). Arrow also created the Danny the Dragon train ride (two trains) for Freedomland and Happy Hollow (1961), the Cave Train and vintage auto rides for the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Adventureland (New York), teacup (&quot;snowball&quot;) and bobsled rides for Santa&#x27;s Village in Scotts Valley, CA, Frontier Village&#x27;s Antique Car Ride, the Timber Mountain Log and Hat Dance (&quot;Sombrero&quot;) rides at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, a suspended monorail and electric boat ride for the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys, CA and Florida and an omnimover type ride for Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate World Great American Chocolate Tour.

Arrow reinvented and improved on the flume ride which had been popular in the early 1900s. The first modern log flume ride being El Aserradero at Six Flags Over Texas which opened in 1963. The Runaway Mine Train (1966), designed by Ron Toomer, was both the first mine train roller coaster and the first roller coaster with an underwater tunnel. Arrow&#x27;s second mine train ride opened at Six Flags over Georgia in 1967, followed by another at Cedar Point in 1969. Arrow Development would build 22 flume rides between 1970 and 1975. Toomer was promoted to Manager of Engineering at Arrow Development in 1971.

Arrow&#x27;s 1979 brochure listed 32 roller coasters, 12 Runaway Mine Trains, 43 Flume rides, 5 &quot;Space Whirl&quot; rides, 4 Rub-a-Dubs, 7 Dark Rides, 20 Special Systems, 49 Antique Car and 28 Sports Car ride installations. Arrow&#x27;s 1979 product brochure also listed eight Merry-Go-Rounds, mostly installed in California, ranging from in diameter.

===Post Disney era transition into Arrow Dynamics and S&amp;S Arrow===
When Disney opened Central Shops in 1971, Dick Nunis, then Executive VP, told Arrow, “I have to admit that we could not have done this without you. But it’s over now. We built this big facility and we’re going to do everything ourselves.” Dana Morgan recalled, “They made it very clear that it was a new era—that they now had all this in-house capability built up, and they would now do everything themselves.”

In 1972, Bacon, Morgan and Schulze decided to sell Arrow Development to Rio Grande Industries. Rio Grande had plans to build several theme parks, in addition to owning a coaster-building company. Carl and Ed acted as consultants to RGI for a few years. Walter Schultz sold all his RGI stock and retired shortly after the acquisition. All of the projects that were submitted during that time were rejected by RGI management, although they were often developed later by other companies. Ron Toomer stated that &quot;building roller coasters really didn&#x27;t fit into Rio Grande&#x27;s scheme of things&quot;. In 1977, Arrow opened a manufacturing facility in the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah. By 1980, they were no longer operating in Mountain View.

On November 22, 1981, Huss Trading Corporation bought Arrow Development from RGI. The new company registered in Utah as Arrow-Huss, with design and administrative offices in Scott&#x27;s Valley, CA. Edgar Morgan&#x27;s son Dana, was President, Robert Peers was a Director and Secretary and Peter Joyce was Vice President and Treasurer. Arrow-Huss registered with the State of California as a Foreign Stock business on January 12, 1981, but its status as a valid company was eventually forfeited. Dana Morgan would be reported as President of Arrow Huss in 1982. Morgan left Arrow-Huss and started Morgan Manufacturing in 1983, nominally to build carousels, although their first contract was for a roller coaster. In 1984, Arrow-Huss&#x27; officers were reported as Bernard Peer Zwickau, President; Boyd Draeger Vice President; Robert Peers, Secretary; Gail E. Dyreng, Comptroller. Klaus Huss, Dr. Urs. Affolter and Robert Peers were reported as Directors. In 1985, Robert Larsen was the Director of Finance.

Arrow-Huss filed for bankruptcy late in November 1984, two weeks after Ron Toomer had relocated his family to Utah. Thirteen of the company’s American officers, including Toomer, negotiated a buyout. Late in 1985 the takeover was approved by the court. By that time none of the original founders of Arrow Development had any financial or managerial interest in the company. On January 10, 1986, Arrow Dynamics was incorporated in Delaware, with offices in Clearfield, Utah, and Norm Scott as President. Scott would die unexpectedly on July 1 of that same year.

Around this time (mid-80&#x27;s) Arrow partnered with Vekoma, a Dutch manufacturer of farming and mining equipment, in an effort to have a dealer in the European market. Initially, Arrow built ride vehicles and the more complex track sections in Utah and shipped them to Holland. Over a period of several months Arrow taught Vekoma to build all types of track sections for their European customers. Vekoma then began competing directly with Arrow in the United States.

On January 6, 1986, restated articles of incorporation, changing the name of Arrow Huss to Arrow Dynamics, Inc. were filed in Delaware. On March 10, 1987, Ron Toomer, Otis S. Hughes and Brent H. Meikle would file an application for certification of authority for Arrow Dynamics, Inc., also in Delaware.

On May 27, 1987, Toomer, Hughes and Meikle would draft articles of incorporation for Arrow Dynamics as a Utah corporation. Issued stock was valued at $12 million. On June 27, 1987, Arrow Dynamics, Inc. (Utah) and Arrow Dynamics, Inc. (Delaware) would merge, with the Delaware corporation surviving. On February 22, 1988, Arrow Dynamics, Inc. would be dissolved as a Delaware corporation. The April 11, 1988, notice also states that the former name of Arrow Dynamics was Arrow Huss, Inc. In a 1988 interview, Toomer would state that although Arrow Huss had been profitable, Huss &quot;just kept taking money out of it&quot;.

Ron Toomer served as President of Arrow Dynamics until 1993. In 1994, he brought in $3.5 million in international funding and was promoted to chairman. Allan Harris was brought in as president about 1995 and was CEO in 1998. Toomer would act as a Consulting Director until his retirement in 1998. Arrow Dynamics&#x27; authority to operate in Utah would be revoked in October 1999 for failure to file their annual report, but be reinstated in November. Toomer retired in 2000.

Arrow Dynamics declared bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, owing more than $2.2 million to its 20 largest unsecured creditors. As part of its reorganization plan, Arrow agreed that it would no longer build its own rides. The court set a $2.25 million minimum price for the purchase of all of Arrow Dynamics assets. On February 8, 2002, the Cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City was lit. The steel tower supporting the cauldron was designed by Arrow Dynamics.

In 2002, S&amp;S Power was looking for opportunities to expand their business, citing acquisitions as the best method to do so. In October, S&amp;S founded S&amp;S Arrow, a limited liability company which purchased the assets of the bankrupt Arrow Dynamics. Despite the name and work of S&amp;S Arrow, legally it was not a successor to Arrow Dynamics.

In November 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co. Ltd, acquired controlling interest in S&amp;S and renamed itself S&amp;S Sansei Technologies. Sansei obtained all the remaining Arrow assets and intellectual property. On a related note; Sansei provides Disney with Omnimover ride systems for the Buzz Lightyear attractions and Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure attractions.

==Arrow Development Properties==

The building at 243 Moffett in Mountain View, which was built in 1946 by the founders, was still standing in December 2013 and the site of an automotive body shop.

The 820 Huff address appears on documents created by Arrow for the Walt Disney Company. It is roughly two blocks north of 1555 Plymouth.

1555 Plymouth was occupied by Arrow Development from April 1960 until November 1980. During that time, the property was one parcel with the address of 1555 Plymouth Street.

South Bay Construction and Development Company (SBCDC) purchased the site in November 1982 and subdivided it into three parcels: 1555, 1615, and 1625 Plymouth Street. SBCDC constructed the building currently at 1555 Plymouth Street in 1983, which was used as storage for Norcal Tech, Inc. The property was sold to Sierra Greens in June 1985 and leased to Silicon Graphics, Inc.

1615 Plymouth - Interaction Chemical leased the 1615 Plymouth Street parcel from SBCDC beginning in December 1982. Interaction Chemical purchased the parcel in May 1983. In 1992, the assets of Interaction Chemical were purchased by Interaction Chromatography, who moved out of the building in May 1992. Fusion Medical Technologies began occupying the property in 1994.

1625 Plymouth - The property was also leased to Norcal from November 1982 to November 1989 and Symtron (who purchased Norcal) from November 1989 to November 1997. During this time, Norcal and Symtron manufactured printed circuit boards at the site. In November 1997, Sanmina Corporation acquired Symtron and subsequently purchased the property two years later in 1999.

On June 25, 2013, Broadreach Capital Partners announced that it had acquired the site comprising 1615 and 1625 Plymouth, where it planned to develop, own and manage a state-of-the-art office project. Broadreach secured $150 million in financing and broke ground on the site in 2018. As of February 2020 the new building is 100% leased and occupied by Google.

<text>The Bukidnon woodcock (Scolopax bukidnonensis), or Philippine woodcock is a medium-sized wader. It was only described as new to science as recently as 2001, although the initial specimens had been collected on Luzon in the 1960s, these were originally misidentified as Eurasian woodcock specimens. It was not until the bird was heard calling in 1993, and new specimens obtained on Mindanao in 1995, that it was realised that the species was new. It is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.

==Description and taxonomy==
The Bukidnon woodcock is rich reddish-brown above, finely barred and vermiculated with black and broadly barred with blackish markings across the crown, the underparts are paler and buffer. The eye is placed high and far back on the head, and the beak is long with a flexible tip to extract worms and other invertebrates from the soil.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Believed to feed at night or at dusk in areas with thick moss and foliage where it possibly feeds on worms and other invertebrates

These birds fly in a wide circuit over the forest, giving a loud, metallic, rattling `pip-pip-pip-pip-pip` interspersed by very quiet grunts.

Little is known about the bird in the wild. It is described as having a &quot;roding&quot; display flight in January to March just before dawn, like other birds of the genus. Nest has been recorded in February and September with 2 eggs.

== Habitat and conservation ==
This species is restricted to mountain forests (over 1000 meters above sea level) on the islands of Mindanao (four mountaintops) and Luzon (center and north) in the Philippines. Its habitat is extremely remote and rugged, and is unsuitable for either logging or agriculture.

The Bukidnon woodcock has a large range and it is relatively common within that range. Its population size has not been quantified but the IUCN has listed it as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;, believing that any decline in population is too slow as to justify placing the bird in a more threatened category. As it occurs in rugged and inaccessible mountains, this has allowed a large portion of its habitat to remain intact. However, there it is still affected by habitat loss through deforestation, mining, land conversion and slash-and-burn - just not to the same extent as lowland forest.

<text>The social web is a set of social relations that link people through the World Wide Web. The social web encompasses how websites and software are designed and developed in order to support and foster social interaction. These online social interactions form the basis of much online activity including online shopping, education, gaming and social networking services. The social aspect of Web 2.0 communication has been to facilitate interaction between people with similar tastes. These tastes vary depending on who the target audience is, and what they are looking for. For individuals working in the public relation department, the job is consistently changing and the impact is coming from the social web. The influence held by the social network is large and ever changing.

As people&#x27;s activities on the Web and communication increase, information about their social relationships become more available. Social networking services such as Facebook enable people and organizations to contact each other with persistent human-friendly names. Today hundreds of millions of Internet users are using thousands of social websites to stay connected with their friends, discover new &quot;friends&quot;, and to share user-created content, such as photos, videos, social bookmarks, and blogs, even through mobile platform support for cell phones. By the second quarter in 2017, Facebook reported 1.86 billion members, and, in 2008, MySpace occupied 100 million users and YouTube had more than 100 million videos and 2.9 million user channels, and these numbers are consistently growing. The social Web is quickly reinventing itself, moving beyond simple web applications that connect individuals to live an entirely new way of life.

==History==

Like the telephone, the Internet was not created as a communication tool to interact socially, but evolved to become a part of everyday life. However, social interaction has been facilitated by the web for nearly the entire duration of its existence, as indicated by the continuing success of social software, which at its core centers around connecting individuals virtually with others whom they already have relationships with in the physical world. Email dates from the 1960s, and was one of the first social applications to connect multiple individuals through a network, enabling social interaction by allowing users to send messages to one or more people. This application, which some have argued may be the most successful social software ever, was actually used to help build the Internet. The web got its start as a large but simple Bulletin Board System (BBS) that allowed users to exchange software, information, news, data, and other messages with one another. Ward Christensen invented the first public BBS in the late 1970s, and another (named &quot;The WELL&quot;) in the late 80&#x27;s and early &#x27;90s arose as a popular online community. The Usenet, a global discussion system similar to a BBS that enabled users to post public messages, was conceived in 1979; the system found tremendous popularity in the 1980s as individuals posted news and articles to categories called &quot;newsgroups&quot;. By the late 1990s, personal web sites that allowed individuals to share information about their private lives with others were increasingly widespread. On this fertile period of the web&#x27;s development, its creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote that:

The term &quot;social Web&quot; was coined by Howard Rheingold for this network in 1996; Rheingold was quoted in an article for &quot;Time&quot; on his website &quot;Electric Minds&quot;, described as a &quot;virtual community center&quot; that listed online communities for users interested in socializing through the Web, saying that &quot;The idea is that we will lead the transformation of the Web into a social Web&quot;.

The social Web developed in three stages from the beginning of the &#x27;90s up to the present day, transforming from simple one-way communication web pages to a network of truly social applications. During the &quot;one-way conversation&quot; era of online applications in the mid &#x27;90s, most of the nearly 18,000 web pages in existence were &quot;read only&quot;, or &quot;static web sites&quot; with information flowing exclusively from the person or organization that ran the site; although the web was used socially at this time, communication was difficult, achieved only through individuals reacting to each other&#x27;s posts on one web page by responding to them on their own personal web page. In the mid &#x27;90s, Amazon and other pioneers made great progress in advancing online social interaction by discovering how to link databases to their web sites in order to store information as well as to display it; in concert with other innovations, this led to the rise of read-write web applications, allowing for a &quot;two-way conversation&quot; between users and the individual or organization running the site. As these web applications became more sophisticated, people became more comfortable using and interacting with them, bandwidth increased, and access to the Internet became more prevalent, causing designers to begin implementing new features that allowed users to communicate not only with a site&#x27;s publishers, but with others who visited that site as well. Despite being a small step forward technologically, it was a huge step socially, enabling group interaction for the first time, and it has been claimed that this social exchange between many individuals is what separates a web application from a &quot;social Web&quot; application.

The first social networking services, including Classmates.com (1995) and SixDegrees.com (1997), were introduced prior to social media sites. It has been argued that the transition towards social media sites began after the world&#x27;s first online interactive diary community Open Diary was founded on December 19, 1998; currently still online after ten years, it has hosted over five million digital diaries. Open Diary successfully brought online diary writers together into one community as an early social networking service, and it was during this time that the term &quot;weblog&quot; was coined (later to be shortened to the ubiquitous &quot;blog&quot; after one blogger jokingly turned weblog into the sentence &quot;we blog&quot;). Some claim that this marked the beginning of the current era of social media, with &quot;social media&quot; being a term that entered into both common usage and prominence as high-speed Internet became increasingly available, growing in popularity as a concept and leading to the rise of social networking services such as Myspace (2003) and Facebook (2004). It has been argued that this trend towards social media &quot;can be seen as an evolution back to the Internet&#x27;s roots, since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it was initially created for: a platform to facilitate information exchange between users.&quot;

==Evolution==
The social web is a way of life: many people visit social networking services at least once per day, and in 2008 the average amount of time per visit to MySpace hovered around twenty-six minutes (the length of a sitcom). Furthermore, the astoundingly rapid growth of the social Web since the &#x27;90s is not projected to slow down anytime soon: with less than 20% of the world&#x27;s population using the Internet, the social Web is felt by some to still be in its infancy. The line between social networking and social media is becoming increasingly blurred as sites such as Facebook and Twitter further incorporate photo, video, and other functionalities typical of social media sites into users&#x27; public profiles, just as social media sites have been integrating features characteristic of social networking services into their own online frameworks. One notable change that has been brought about by the merging of social networking/media is the transformation of social web applications into egocentric software that put people at the center of applications. Although there had been discussion about a sense of community on the web prior to these innovations, modern social web software makes a wider set of social interactions available to the user, such as &quot;friending&quot; and &quot;following&quot; individuals, even sending them virtual gifts or kisses. Social Web applications are typically built using object oriented programming, utilizing combinations of several programming languages, such as Ruby, PHP, Python, ASP.NET and/or Java. Often APIs are utilized to tie non-social websites to social websites, one example being Campusfood.com.

===Blogs and wikis===

Both blogs and Wikis are prime examples of collaboration through the Internet, a feature of the group interaction that characterizes the social Web. Blogs are used as BBS for the 21st century on which people can post discussions, whereas Wikis are constructed and edited by anyone who is granted access to them. Members of both are able to see the recent discussions and changes made, although for many blogs and Wikis such as Wikipedia this is true even for non-members. Blogs and Wikis allow users to share information and educate one another, and these social interaction are focused on content and meaning. Blogs and Wikis are used by both those writing them and those who reference them as resources. Blogs allow members to share ideas and other members to comment on those ideas, while Wikis facilitate group collaboration: both of these tools open a gateway of communication in which social interaction allows the web to develop. These sites are used by teachers and students alike to accomplish the goal of sharing education, and working in a community with other scholars enables the users to see different interpretations of similar subjects as well as to share resources that might not be available to them otherwise.

===Mobile connectivity support===
Most social networking services offer mobile apps and internet phone connectivity. Popular social web sites such Facebook Mobile, Orkut, Twitter, and YouTube have led the way for other sites to enable their users to post and share new content with others, update their statuses and receive their friends&#x27; updates and uploaded content via mobile platforms.The central aim for both sites offering these mobile services and for those who use them is for the user to maintain contact with their friends online at all times; it allows them to update their profiles and to communicate with each other even when they are away from a computer. It is predicted that this trend will continue in the future, not as other sites follow suit to offer similar services, but as they are extended to other mobile devices that social web users will carry with them in years to come. Social web mobile applications can also allow for augmented reality gaming and experiences; examples of such include SCVGR and Layar.

===Social features added to non-social sites===

Web sites that are not built around social interaction nevertheless add features that enable discussion and collaboration out of an interest in expanding their user bases—a trend that is projected to continue in the coming years. As early as 1995 electronic retailer Amazon had implemented such features, especially the customer review, to great success; Joshua Porter, author of &quot;Designing for the Social Web,&quot; writes:

These customer reviews contribute valuable information that individuals seek out, and are written by users for free simply out of a desire to share their experiences with a product or service with others; the quality and value of each review is further determined by other users, who rate them based upon whether or not they found the feedback helpful, &quot;weeding out the bad (by pushing them to the bottom [of the page]).&quot;

Non-retailer, special interest websites have also implemented social web features to broaden their appeal: one example is Allrecipes.com, a community of 10 million cooks that share ideas and recipes with one another. In addition to exchanging recipes with others through the website, users are able to rate and post reviews of recipes they have tried, and to provide suggestions as to how to improve or alter them; according to the website, &quot;The ratings/reviews...are a valuable resource to our community because they show how the members and their families feel about a recipe. Does the recipe get raves—or does it never get made again? Your opinion counts&quot;. This feedback is used to evaluate and classify recipes based upon how successfully they passed through the site&#x27;s &quot;editorial process&quot; and to what extent they were approved by site members, potentially resulting in receiving &quot;Kitchen approved&quot; status that is comparable to Wikipedia&#x27;s &quot;good article&quot; nomination process. The site has also augmented its services by including social features such as user blogs and connecting with other social networking/media sites like Facebook to expand its presence on the social Web. The recipes found on this website become part of the social web as other members rank them, comment and provide feedback as to why the recipe was good or bad, or to share ways in which they would change it.

The integration of &quot;social&quot; features has also begun to extend into non-Web media forms including print and broadcast. Increasingly prevalent mobile devices have offered a platform for media companies to create hybridised media forms which draw upon the social web, such as the Fango mobile app offered by Australian partnership Yahoo!7 which combines traditional TV programming with live online discussions and existing social networking channels.

===Social art===

Artists use the social Web to share their art, be it visual art on sites like deviantART, video art on YouTube, musical art on YouTube or iTunes, or physical art, such as posting and selling crafted items on Craigslist. Artists choose to post their art online so that they can gain critiques on their work, as well as just have the satisfaction of knowing others can experience and enjoy their work. With this social web generation, students spend more time using social tools like computers, video games, video cameras and cell phones. These tools allow the art to be shared easily, and aid in the discussion.

===Collaborative efforts facilitated by the social web===

====Crowdsourcing====
Crowdsourcing has become one of the ways in which the social Web can be used collaborative efforts, particularly in the last few years, with the dawn of the semantic web and Web 2.0. Modern web applications have the capabilities for crowdsourcing techniques, and consequently the term is now used exclusively for web-based activity. Examples include sites such as SurveyMonkey.com and SurveyU.com; for example, SurveyMonkey enables users to administer surveys to a list of contacts they manage, then collect and analyze response data using basic tools provided on the website itself and finally export these results once they are finished.

Crowdsourcing is used by researchers in order to emulate a traditional focus group, but in a less expensive and less intimate atmosphere.
Due to the nature of the social Web, people feel more open to express what their thoughts are on the topic of discussion without feeling as though they will be as heavy scrutinized by the rest of the group when compared to a traditional setting. The Internet serves as a screen, helping to evoke the purest feedback from the participants in the group, as it removes much of a mob mentality.

Facebook has also been a mode in which crowdsourcing can occur, as users typically ask a question in their status message hoping those that see it on his or her news feed will answer the question, or users may opt to use the poll option now available to obtain information from those within their friends network.

====Community-based software projects====

Through the use of the social Web, many software developers opt to participate in community-based open-source software projects, as well as hacking projects for proprietary software, kernel (computing) modifications, and freeware ports of games and software. Linux iterations are perfect examples of how effective and efficient this sort of collaboration can be. Google&#x27;s Android operating system is another example, as many coders work on modifying existing hardware kernels and ROMs to create customized forms of a released Android version. These collaborative efforts for Android take place typically through xda-developers and androidforums.com.

===Mobile application development===

Most of the modern mobile applications, and indeed even browser applications, come from released software development kits to developers. The developers create their applications and share them with users via &quot;app markets&quot;. Users can comment on their experiences with the applications, allowing all users to view the comments of others, and thus have a greater understanding of what is to be expected from the application. Typically there is also a rating a system in addition to comments.

Mobile social Web applications are built using various APIs. These APIs allow for the interaction and interconnection of data on one social database, be it Facebook, Twitter, or Google Account, thus creating a literal web of data connections. These applications then add to the user experience specific to the application itself. Examples include TweetDeck and Blogger.

==From the social web to real life==

The way in which individuals share intimate details, and perform tasks such as dating, shopping, and applying for jobs is very different from in previous generations. Now, one&#x27;s preferences, opinions, and activities are routinely shared with a group of friends with whom they may or may not ever meet were it not for the social web.

Many social websites use online social interaction to create a bridge to real life interaction. Relationships are formed between individuals via the internet and then become more personal through other forms of communication. An example of this type of interaction is found on eBay: with more than 94 million active users globally, eBay is the world&#x27;s largest online marketplace, where anyone can buy and sell practically anything. This website allows individuals to sell items and other to bid on these items. At the end of the auction, the buyer pays the seller; the buyer then sends the purchased product to the winner of the auction. The relationship begins on the internet, but extends into real life interaction. Ways in eBay facilitates this interaction include Skype, a leading online communications service that enables people to communicate through voice or video online for free. eBay Inc. acquired Skype in 2005 and significantly expanded its customer base to more than 480 million registered users in nearly every country on earth. The result of all eBay transactions is a seller providing the buyer with a product, most commonly via mail: web interaction ending in a real world exchange.

The relationship that is formed with eBay users is similar to the users of Craigslist. Users place items that they want to sell on the website, and other users that are looking to purchase these items contact the seller. Craigslist is used to bring together individuals and organizations and connect them to the resources, tools, technology and ideas they need to effectively engage in community building and see the impact of their actions. This is done via email or over the telephone. The buyer and the seller form a meeting in which goods are exchanged for money. Without this type of website, the buyer would not know that the product was available by the seller. This type of website allows members of a physical community to network with the other members of their community to exchange goods and services.

The transaction from web to real life is seen on a macro scale most recently on dating websites, which are used to search and match other users. These websites allow members with a common interest, to find others with this same interest. Academics who have studied the industry believe that it and other forms of electronic communication such as e-mail and social networks are starting to have a significant effect on the ways in which people find love. Users are able to interact with one another and find if they have common interests. Many sites have been developed that target many different interest groups, and relationships form and develop using the internet. If the users decide that they share a mutual bond, they are able to interact via the telephone, and eventually in person. The relationship begins on the internet, but can lead to real life dating and eventually even marriage.

<text>Time/Life (subtitled (Song for the Whales and Other Beings)) is an album by Charlie Haden&#x27;s Liberation Music Orchestra arranged by composer and pianist Carla Bley and released on the Impulse! label in 2016. It features two tracks from Haden&#x27;s final live performance with the Orchestra along with additional studio recordings completed after his death.

== Reception ==
Allmusic awarded the album 4½ stars and said it was &quot;an atmospheric, elegiac album inspired by Haden&#x27;s longstanding love and concern for the environment&quot; and noted &quot;What is also particularly compelling about &quot;Time/Life&quot; is how well the live recordings blend with the studio tracks. Much of this is due to Bley, whose arranging and spare, harmonic piano skills bridge the recordings and help elevate the album to one of the best in the LMO&#x27;s catalog&quot;. They also selected it as one of their Favorite Jazz Albums of 2016. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Fordham observed &quot;These five pieces (with Haden playing on two, and his bass deputy Steve Swallow on the others) include the classic Miles Davis/Bill Evans ballad &quot;Blue in Green&quot; – featuring a typically spare and throbbing Haden solo and gorgeous tenor sax playing from Tony Malaby and Chris Cheek – and Carla Bley’s slow-burn throwback to earlier Liberation Music days in the march-time snare-drum beat of the title track&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s Dave Gelly said &quot;the orchestra’s unrestrained sound suggests the luxuriance of nature. The first solo of the whole set is taken by Haden himself, his dark, woody tone quite unmistakable. It may have been his last&quot;. Cormac Larkin of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said &quot;It opens and closes with live recordings – among the last made before Haden’s death in 2014 – including a luminous version of Miles Davis’s Blue in Green. The rest of this powerful, emotionally charged album was recorded by his grieving fellow musicians the day after Haden’s memorial service in New York, and is a fitting farewell to a great and courageous musician&quot;.

On September 15, 2010, Mullan was traded along with a fourth-round pick in the 2013 MLS SuperDraft (later converted to a pick in the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft) to the Colorado Rapids in exchange for Colin Clark and allocation money.

On April 22, 2011, The Rapids were facing Seattle Sounders FC. In the third minute, Mullan had the ball taken off him by Sounders winger Steve Zakuani. Mullan, who felt he had been fouled by Sounders defender Tyson Wahl on the play, got up frustrated and chased Zakuani down. Mullan went in with a hard and reckless tackle, breaking the tibia and fibula in Zakuani&#x27;s right leg. Mullan was shown a red card, while Zakuani was stretchered off and was rushed to the hospital. After the game Mullan was quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for Steve. It was never my intention to injure him in the least. It was a tackle that I&#x27;ve done hundreds of times, and I&#x27;d probably do it again.&quot; Seattle coach Sigi Schmid, who had coached Mullan with the Los Angeles Galaxy, defended Mullan in the post game interview, saying the injury was never Mullan&#x27;s intent. Mullan issued a formal apology on April 27, saying &quot;It is with regret that my tackle resulted in the injury of Steve and I am deeply sorry to Steve and all those impacted by his injury.&quot; Mullan took time off of practice and sought counselling over the incident. On April 28, it was announced that Mullan would be given a nine-game suspension, on top of the automatic one-game suspension for the red card, as well as a fine. The 10-game suspension is the longest in league history for an on-field tackle, however some fans and media felt the suspension was too short. The Rapids originally wanted to appeal the suspension, but Mullan refused to appeal. He returned from the suspension on June 26, playing 67 minutes in a 4–1 loss to the Columbus Crew. On August 5, Mullan scored his first goal for the Rapids, helping them to a 2–0 win against Columbus.

In the first round of the playoffs, Mullan had an assist to give the Rapids a 1–0 win over Columbus.

Mullan also made three appearances and scored one goal during the group stage of the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League. Mullan signed a multi-year contract extension with Colorado on December 5, 2011.

Mullan recorded his first assist of the 2012 season on April 1, helping Colorado get a 2–0 win against the Chicago Fire. On April 14, 2012, the Rapids lost 1–0 at the Seattle Sounders. It was Mullan&#x27;s first game in Seattle since he had injured Steve Zakuani in 2011 and Sounders fans booed him every time he touched the ball. On May 6, Mullan had two assists as the Rapids beat FC Dallas 2–0. He scored his first goal of the season on June 20 in a 2–1 loss to the Earthquakes. On July 7, Mullan and the Rapids visited the Sounders, losing 2–1. During the game, Zakuani made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute. After the match Mullan and Zakuani swapped jerseys and hugged each other. Zakuani said after the game &quot;I forgave him a long time ago, but I think it is good for the public to see, for closure.&quot; On August 4, Mullan played in his 300th MLS regular season game as the Rapids beat Real Salt Lake 1–0. He underwent knee surgery on October 18, causing him to miss the final two games of the regular season. Mullan ended the season with 2 goals and 7 assists from 28 regular appearances. He had been dealing with pain in his knee throughout the season and with the Rapids already eliminated from the playoffs, Colorado and Mullan went ahead with the surgery. It was the first time Mullan had missed out on the playoffs during his MLS career.
At the start of the 2013 season, Rapids coach Óscar Pareja converted Mullan to a left-back. He played there for the first four games of the season before being switched to a right-back. Mullan did not appear during the final three months of the season, partly due to injuries, but also because Pareja preferred different players in that position. Mullan made 16 appearances and had 2 assists during the regular season, helping the Rapids qualify for the playoffs. However he would not appear during their one playoff game. On December 10, the Rapids declined Mullan&#x27;s contract option for the 2014 season.

On January 14, 2014, Mullan signed a new contract with the Rapids. He had his right knee scoped during the offseason. Mullan retired from professional soccer at the end of the 2014 MLS season.

He made his first start for the U.S. on March 9, 2005, in a 3–0 win over Colombia in a friendly. In March 2007, he earned the 3rd and 4th caps of his career, coming on as a substitute in friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala.

== Personal life ==
Mullan was born in Mineola, New York, to Bob and Jackie Mullan, but his family moved to Littleton, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, when he was young. Mullan and his two brothers grew up playing as hockey goalkeepers, but Mullan decided to focus on soccer. Mullan began dating his wife Kersten while in high school, although they attended different high schools. She originally attended the University of North Carolina-Asheville to play soccer, but she transferred to Creighton University to be closer to Mullan. They got married in 2001 and together they have two sons. Following his retirement from pro soccer, Mullan became a nurse.

<doc id="1134198" wikidata="Q935292" url="?curid=1134198" title="Neo-Dada">
<text>Neo-Dada was a movement with audio, visual and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier Dada artwork. It sought to close the gap between art and daily life, and was a combination of playfulness, iconoclasm, and appropriation. In the United States the term was popularized by Barbara Rose in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, particularly in Japan and in Europe, serving as the foundation of Fluxus, Pop Art and Nouveau réalisme.

Neo-Dada has been exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and absurdist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of Abstract Expressionism and, taking a lead from the practice of Marcel Duchamp and Kurt Schwitters, denied traditional concepts of aesthetics.

==Trends==
Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as Robert Motherwell&#x27;s &quot;The Dada Painters and Poets&quot; (1951) and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed. However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against bourgeois aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.

Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, Piero Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;Consacrazione dell&#x27;arte dell&#x27;uovo sodo&quot; (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist&#x27;s personal creation and art as commodity.
An allied approach is found in the creation of collage and assemblage, as in the junk sculptures of the American Richard Stankiewicz, whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters&#x27; practice. These objects are &quot;so treated that they become less discarded than found, &quot;objets trouvés&quot;.&quot; Jean Tinguely&#x27;s fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing &quot;Homage to New York&quot; (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical.

Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Robert Rauschenberg labeled as &quot;combines&quot; such works as &quot;Bed&quot; (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. Arman labeled as &quot;accumulations&quot; his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as &quot;poubelles&quot; the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. Daniel Spoerri created &quot;snare pictures&quot; (&quot;tableaux piège&quot;), of which the earliest was &quot;Kichka&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.

==Poems==
In the Netherlands the poets associated with the &#x27;magazine for texts&#x27;, &quot;Barbarber&quot; (1958–71), particularly J. Bernlef and K. Schippers, extended the concept of the readymade into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet. Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine &quot;Gard Sivik&quot; and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager, Hans Verhagen and the artist Armando. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that &quot;the poet&#x27;s role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non-poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers.&quot;

The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914–94), the theorist of the Dutch Nul group of artists, to which Armando also belonged: &quot;Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero.&quot; This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau Réaliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism.

The beginnings of Concrete Poetry and text montage in the Wiener Gruppe have also been referred back to the example of Raoul Hausmann&#x27;s letter poems. Such techniques may also owe something to H.N. Werkman&#x27;s typographical experiments in the Netherlands which had first been put on display in the Stedelijk Museum in 1945.

<doc id="1134201" wikidata="Q439501" url="?curid=1134201" title="Old City Hall (Toronto)">
<text>The Old City Hall is a Romanesque-style civic building and former court house in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the home of the Toronto City Council from 1899 to 1966 and a provincial court house until 2023, and remains one of the city&#x27;s most prominent structures.

The building is located at the corner of Queen and Bay Streets, across Bay Street from Nathan Phillips Square and the present City Hall in Downtown Toronto. The heritage landmark has a distinctive clock tower which heads the length of Bay Street from Front Street to Queen Street as a terminating vista. Old City Hall was designated a National Historic Site in 1984.

==History==
Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall was one of the largest buildings in Toronto and the largest civic building in North America upon completion in 1899. It was the burgeoning city&#x27;s third city hall. It housed Toronto&#x27;s municipal government and courts for York County and Toronto, taking over from the Adelaide Street Court House. York County offices were also located in Old City Hall from 1900 to 1953. With the establishment of Metropolitan Toronto, the county seat and court moved to Newmarket, Ontario (and to the Old Newmarket Town Hall and Courthouse).

Designed by prominent Toronto architect Edward James Lennox, the building took more than a decade to build and cost more than $2.5 million (equals close to 53 million today). Work on the building began in 1889 and was built on the site of old York buildings including the Lennox hotel. It was constructed of sandstone from the Credit River valley, grey stone from the Orangeville, Ontario area, and brown stone from New Brunswick. Angry councillors, due to cost overruns and construction delays, refused E.J. Lennox a plaque proclaiming him as architect for the completed building in 1899. Not to be denied, Lennox had stonemasons &quot;sign&quot; his name in corbels beneath the upper floor eaves around the entire building: &quot;EJ LENNOX ARCHITECT AD 1898&quot;.

Lennox designed an annex, called Manning Chambers after former mayor Alexander Manning, at the northwest corner of Bay and Queen Street. Completed in 1900, the five-storey building was later demolished to make way for the current Toronto City Hall. 

Planners proposed a public plaza at the south entrance of the city hall called &quot;Victoria Square&quot;. The space was to be an urban square with diagonal walkways meeting at a central statue of Queen Victoria, its proposed namesake. The plan was never executed and a smaller space was allocated in front of the building by Queen Street. The City Beautiful movement influenced Toronto planning as well in the early 20th century, and a plan was formulated for a grand thoroughfare from Queen Street at City Hall to Front Street that would have been called &quot;Federal Avenue&quot;. It, too, was never built, though the City Beautiful movement did influence the urban design principles of nearby University Avenue.

At the foot of the steps on Queen Street is the Cenotaph, erected in 1925 to honour Torontonians who died in World War I fighting for Canada, and later also in honour of Torontonians who died in the Second World War, the Korean War, and Canadian peacekeeping operations during Remembrance Day ceremonies every November 11.

Four gargoyles were part of the Clock Tower during the 1899 construction, but were removed due to the effects of the weather on the sandstone carvings in 1938. In 2002, bronze casts of the gargoyles were reinstalled. The replicas are not duplicates as the original designs were lost. The gargoyles are similar to those on the Peace Tower in Ottawa. Two grotesques and antique lampposts at the base of the grand staircase inside were removed in 1947 and sold. They were reclaimed by the City and reinstalled in the 1980s.

Despite its size, Old City Hall proved inadequate for Toronto&#x27;s growing municipal government within a couple of decades of completion. Under Mayor Nathan Phillips, Toronto City Council launched an international design competition for a new city hall and public square across Bay Street and completed a striking Modernist city hall and public square in 1965. Soon after in the 1960s, plans were made to start construction of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The original plans called for Old City Hall to be demolished and replaced by a retail complex, and a number of skyscrapers around a large plaza, leaving only the cenotaph (or in one plan, the clock tower) in the front. Public outcry forced authorities to abandon these plans, and the Eaton Centre was constructed around the landmark civic building and the Church of the Holy Trinity (which was also slated for demolition). Old City Hall then became a dedicated courthouse.

===Future===
The building was leased for several decades by the provincial government and used as a court house for the Ontario Court of Justice. The City of Toronto served notice on the province that its lease at Old City Hall would not be renewed past December 31, 2016. In 2023, most court rooms and services moved to a new purpose-built courthouse at 10 Armoury Street, leaving eight municipally-run provincial offence courts which are scheduled to relocate from Old City Hall to St. Lawrence Market North in April 2025.

The city spent $77 million on renovations completed in 2005 to restore the exterior and the 103.6-metre-high clock tower. Over the next two years, the city spent an additional $7.2-million on interior repairs completed in 2012. There was speculation that the building would house a museum for the city of Toronto.

On September 21, 2015, the City of Toronto released an internal study that recommended leasing parts of the Old City Hall to retail tenants. However, in early October, the city said it would allow courts to remain until December 31, 2021, while the new 10 Armoury Street courthouse was constructed. This was extended until 2023 due to construction delays. In lieu of converting the structure into retail space, the Government Management Committee voted to study housing a city museum in the historic structure.

Toronto City Council voted in 2018 to advance plans for a city museum at the site but little progress has been made as of 2024 and staff estimate $190 million of work will be required before a new occupant can move into the building.

The provincial government is reportedly considering using the building as a temporary home for the Ontario Legislative Assembly once Queen&#x27;s Park closes in 2026 for extensive renovations.

==Architecture==
Old City Hall can be described as an enormous square quad with a courtyard in the middle. Situated at the front elevation, its clock tower was placed off centre to provide a terminating vista for Bay Street. In spite of this seeming asymmetry, the balance of the design is still existent throughout. Ultimately, even though the clock tower was off centre, balance was achieved through the repetition of the subtle details of measure and pattern. For example, to the right side of the main entrance a narrow circular tower rises 21.4 meters from grade. It is cut precisely in half by the roof line; it extends above the roof line by 10.7 meters and is also 10.7 meters from the roof line to the base of the main tower. Further on, the east and west pavilions, although quite different in their designs, are very similar in shape. The double-storied oriel of the east tower is exaggerated to counter the weight of the double tower of the west pavilion. The subtle balance is able to stand out at the main entrance of the building and prevent it from being overshadowed by the clock tower. The exterior rock-face wall was built in a series of courses, in variable sizes separated by carved bands. Grouped columns are repeatedly used to accent the windows.

===Romanesque Revival style===
Old City Hall was designed by architect E. J. Lennox in a variation of Romanesque Revival architecture known as Richardsonian Romanesque. Developed by Henry Hobson Richardson, this variation highlights bulk and massiveness as well as different sculptural features. The Romanesque style originated in Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries and had characteristics such as square towers, asymmetrical massing, stone carvings, round arches, and heavy stonework. During the mid-1800s, this style was revitalized in Western architecture. H.H. Richardson contributed dormers, circular towers with conical roofs, and the use of different-coloured stone for the revival style that bears his name. Carvings of humans and animals were also part of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Lennox was interested in and was influenced by Richardson&#x27;s work and travelled to the United States while he was planning his design for Toronto&#x27;s third city hall in the late 19th century.

These influences can be seen at Old City Hall with many of its many arches and towers. Also, the use of different-coloured stone contributes towards the Romanesque style of design. The exterior and interiors of Old City Hall are crafted with great detail. On the clock tower, four stone gargoyles were placed near the top of the tower. Near the building&#x27;s entrance, there are several grotesque faces carved in stone. Lennox included his own likeness next to the other carved faces which, tradition has it, represent city councillors. Lennox&#x27;s own face is identified as one of the caricatures by his handlebar moustache.

The entire building has ornamentation derived from ancient Roman art. There are structural decorations used by the different colours of stone. The stone carvers did not complete work until a year after opening day, as there were many decorative pieces. The stonework on the entrance was restored in 1999.

Made primarily of sandstone, Old City Hall features a two-tone façade. One tone is made of light brown-grey sandstone from the former Beaumont Quarries (now known as Dorchester Sandstone Quarries located in Westmorland County, New Brunswick). This tone is accented with darker reddish-brown sandstone known as Sackville Sandstone (also located in the Westmorland County of New Brunswick). The transportation of the stone employed the use of over 1,360 rail-car loads, equivalent to a nine-mile-long (14.5 km) train, to bring the material to the site. In addition to the stone, 8,354 barrels of cement were used to hold everything together.

What is interesting about the sandstone is not just the variations in colour, but also the textural characteristics of the stone. Observation of the building&#x27;s profile shows it is cut stone with a rock-faced texture application. Despite the roughness of the sandstone, it is not perceived to be jagged, but rather heavily weathered. The raw state of the sandstone reinforces the natural state of the material and greatly heightens the overall sense of mass that the building exhibits. The scale of the stone pieces greatly contributes to the sense of mass as well, conveying the sense that the building was literally carved from the rock and placed where it currently resides.

The building bears a resemblance to the city hall buildings in Cincinnati and Minneapolis.

===Interior===
Within the three large oak doorways of the main entrance are steps leading to a two-storey main hall. In the arcade upon entering the building from the main entrance on Queen Street, there are murals designed by George Agnew Reid detailing Toronto&#x27;s pioneers and angels related to their experiences. On the far left is a mural of Mackenzie, Allan, Macdonnel, Ryerson and Scadding depicting farmers and workers. The spandrel portion of this arcade has four angels painted on it. The first is discovery saying “hail to the pioneers,” the second is fame, saying “to their names and deeds,” the third is fortune which says “remembered and forgotten,” lastly is adventure saying “we honour here.” On the right side of the arcade is another mural depicting Galinee, Simcoe, Tecumseh, Brock, Osgoode, Baldwin, Laura Secord and Strachan depicting pioneers.

Together these murals depict early history of Toronto with the angels representing the four achievements by these pioneers. Directly opposite are a grand staircase and an extraordinary stained-glass window designed by Robert McCausland, the renowned Toronto stained-glass artist. The monumental window entitled &quot;The Union of Commerce and Industry&quot;, depicts civic progress and the &quot;upbuilding&quot; of Toronto. It is organized in three arches and features 12 life-sized figures amidst scenes of the city&#x27;s waterfront and a depiction of Toronto&#x27;s second city hall on Front Street East. A marble war memorial is positioned below the window, dedicated to victims of the Second World War. Also in the vicinity is the 4.5 m-wide (15 ft.) divided stairway, leading to a landing branching east and west to what used to be the county and city divisions of the building. Stucco pillars were shaped by Italian craftsmen. Surviving original interior includes detailing in wood, plaster, iron, bronze and marble, including a mosaic floor laid by Jacomo Bespirt and family, columns with plaster capitals, faux-marble finishes, woodwork, wrought-iron grotesques and gas lamp standards, and door knobs bearing the city&#x27;s old coat of arms.
The main hall in its day was said to be the city&#x27;s grandest indoor space, amazing visitors. Today, exhibit cabinets that display a collection of photographs and artifacts are found on the main floor of the entrance lobby. Also, when court is not in session, the former Council Chamber, with its spectator gallery above and late 19th-century ambiance, is open to the public.

===Clock tower===
Old City Hall features a large, 103.6 metre-tall (340 ft) clock tower that is a terminating vista for Bay Street south of Queen Street West and is also prominently visible from Queen Street and Nathan Phillips Square. The clock tower was the tallest structure in Canada for 18 years from 1899 until 1917. The clock was made in Croydon, England by Gillett &amp; Johnston, for many years, A.G. Abernethy, clockmaker on Yonge Street was in charge with repairing and maintaining the clock. Four garnished stone gargoyles sat at the upper corners of the clock tower; these ornaments were removed due to the effects of the weather on the sandstone carvings in 1938, but bronze casts of the gargoyles were reinstalled in 2002.

The clock functioned manually until the 1950s when it was automated. In 1992, the clock was stopped for the first time in more than a century to perform maintenance and repairs. The maintenance consisted of painting the metallic components of the clock: its bronze, brass, iron and steel. The room, at the top of the tower, enclosed on four sides by timepieces, houses the glass box in which the clock&#x27;s mechanism sits. The room is accessible by stairs only; there are 280 steps to climb. The elevator that was built with the structure was taken out in the 1920s. The clock&#x27;s face measures in diameter.
===Bells===
The clock room houses three large bells, two small quarter bells that strike every quarter hour and a bourdon bell which strikes every hour, the bourdon alone weighs 5443 kilograms. There is one small and unofficial inscription just below the coat of arms on the bell, which reads “J.K.Oct.18, 1900”. The bourdon also rarely rings for special events like the Bells of Peace program in 2014, which commemorates 100 years since the end of the First World War.

==Appearances in cultural works==
Artist William Armstrong painted a watercolour painting of Old City Hall prior to its completion. The building features prominently in the novel &quot;Old City Hall&quot;, by Robert Rotenberg. For the 2009 Luminato arts festival, artist Kurt Perschke brought &quot;Redball Project&quot; to Toronto and temporarily installed a giant red ball in locations around Toronto&#x27;s downtown core, including inside the central arch of the main entrance to Old City Hall.

In terms of popular culture, the building is sometimes used to film movies and television shows, such as &quot;This is Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, &quot;Street Legal&quot;, &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Pictures&quot;. Interiors of the space can be seen in the trial scenes near the end of the 1999 film &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot;.

Old City Hall appears in the 1981 children&#x27;s book &quot;Jonathan Cleaned Up — Then He Heard a Sound&quot; (or &quot;Blackberry Subway Jam&quot;) by Robert Munsch and illustrated by Michael Martchenko. However in the 1984 animated adaptation produced by the National Film Board, the location is Toronto&#x27;s new city hall instead.

<doc id="1134211" wikidata="Q2893699" url="?curid=1134211" title="Canadian International Air Show">
<text>The Canadian International Air Show (CIAS) is an annual air show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The show is an aeronautical display of military, government and civilian aircraft, primarily from Canada and the United States. The show takes place along Toronto&#x27;s waterfront for three days during the Canadian Labour Day weekend. The show began in 1946 and has been held at Exhibition Place since 1949.

==History==
Toronto was the site of numerous air shows as the city developed into a centre of air transportation and aircraft manufacturing in the early twentieth century. The Canadian International Air Show began in 1946 when the National Aeronautical Association of Canada attracted overflow crowds to a show at de Havilland Canada manufacturing plant at Downsview Airport. The show became an annual event. The air show moved to Exhibition Place in 1949. In 1956, the air show became affiliated with the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE).

==Present==
The official CIAS takes place over the Canadian Labour Day Weekend, which coincides with the closing weekend of the CNE. The start time for the show is scheduled for 12:00 pm with the show ending at approximately 3:00 pm each afternoon. The CIAS practice session is usually held on the day before the official CIAS, taking place between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm

The show is performed over Lake Ontario directly south of Exhibition Place. It can be best viewed from Exhibition Place or Ontario Place, although the show is visible from any other lakefront site, especially Marilyn Bell Park or Coronation Park. Performers fly in from Pearson, as well as the island airport on nearby Toronto Islands. Admission to the air show is free; however, viewing from Exhibition Place requires paid admission to the CNE.

There is no static display of aircraft. A photo tour at Pearson had been introduced in 1993 and a full static display in 1996. Although a success, the display was cancelled by the time of the 1998 air show.

In 2020, both the air show and that summer&#x27;s Canadian National Exhibition were cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the air show took place, even though the CNE was cancelled.

===Local opposition===
The airshow is unpopular with some nearby residents who object to the noise created by the jet fighters participating in the show and others who object to the military participation. It has been noted that the noise of the jet fighter demonstrations specifically is similar to that experienced by persons in active war zones. In 2016, a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; columnist noted, &quot;that in a city with a large population of refugee newcomers and people who have experienced the trauma of war it is insulting, invasive, and violent&quot;. Since 2012, during the airshow weekend, the Wikipedia article about the show has been repeatedly vandalized as a form of protest against the airshow, a phenomenon noted by the local Toronto media.

In 2021, Toronto City Councillor Joe Cressy called for an end to the air show and in 2023, Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow wrote air show organizers a letter saying: &quot;“Millions of Torontonians chose to take root in this City as a place of hope. A place of refuge. For many residents, the tremendous noise generated by high-powered jets flying overhead brings back unwanted memories of the violence and war they fled to call Toronto home.”

According to the City of Toronto, the air show &quot;complies with all regulations, including those published by Transport Canada relating to noise.&quot;

==Performers==

The air show is typically a mix of Canadian and United States military aircraft, private aerobatic performers and civilian aircraft flypasts. The air show is often used by the Government of Canada to display new aircraft in the use of the government, such as search and rescue aircraft. On occasion, the air show has displayed unique civilian aircraft, such as the Concorde, and military aircraft of other nations. Flypasts have often included heritage military aircraft. The air show has included demonstrations of parachuting, aerial fire fighting and search and rescue missions.

Regular performers include the Snowbirds, other Canadian Armed Forces aircraft, the United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Navy (USN). Past performers have included the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association, Vintage Wings of Canada, as well as private aerobatics teams, and commercial airlines.

* September 2, 1966: United States Navy Blue Angels pilot Lt. Cmdr. Dick Oliver was killed when he crashed his F-11 Tiger into a breakwater at the Toronto Island Airport. The airplane was travelling west-to-east across the exhibition waterfront, lost altitude and crashed. Debris injured two bystanders at the Island airport.
* September 5, 1976: A De Havilland DH-83C Fox Moth spun into Lake Ontario. The aircraft came to rest approximately 50–75 feet (15–23 m) from spectators on the shoreline in approximately of water. The pilot, Garth Martin, directed rescuers to a passenger, George Benedik, who was submerged in the wreck. Toronto Harbour Police (THP) Leading Hand (L/H) Robert Riekstins dove into the water three times before extracting Benedik from the wreck. Benedik was unconscious and without a pulse when loaded into a rescue boat. Rescuers successfully revived Benedik with external heart massage and mouth to nose artificial resuscitation (due to facial injuries). L/H Riekstins was later presented the Toronto Harbour Police Commissioners&#x27; Award of Merit medal for &quot;heroism and dedication to duty&quot;.
* September 2, 1977: A Fairey Firefly crashed after attempting to pull up after a manoeuvre. The pilot, Allen Ness, who was a founding member of the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, stalled the aircraft and was killed.

At approximately 100 feet (30 m) the sling hook failed and the moose fell to the ground approximately 200 feet (60 m) from the departure point, just off of airport property. Although Bruce suffered minor damage he was able to perform his duties at the air show.
* September 4, 2000: En route to aerial display, Canadian Forces Snowbird Demonstration Team (431 Squadron) departed Toronto Pearson International Airport as a formation. Approximately 3 nautical miles (NM; 5.6 km) east of the airport an emergency was declared, the formation turned south and climbed to approximately 3,500 feet (1067 m). Approximately, 6 NM (11.1 km) south of the airport Snowbird 4 requested a landing. Snowbird 4&#x27;s tail had collided in mid-air with Snowbird 1&#x27;s left wing leading edge and belly smoke tank.

<text>The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair (RAWF), also known as The Royal, is an annual agricultural fair that is held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the first two weeks of November. It was inaugurated in 1922 in the Coliseum, on the grounds of Exhibition Place. It has since been expanded to also take up the Enercare Centre and remains an important exhibit for livestock breeders. Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, was the fair&#x27;s royal patron. Members of the Canadian Royal Family have also been guests of honour at the fair. It is the largest indoor agricultural fair in the world.

==History==
Following the First World War, a group of farmers led by W. A. Dryden, from Brooklin, Ontario, sought to create a national agricultural exhibition, partly to set national standards for the judging of domestic animals. Together, they formed the Agricultural Winter Fair Association of Canada and quickly received, in 1920, permission from King George V for use of the prefix &quot;royal&quot;.

In 1920, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a new livestock arena on the Toronto Exhibition Grounds to house the new fair and other uses. Plans called for the first mounting of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair to take place in 1921, but this was delayed when a heating system for the new arena could not be installed in time. The first show thus opened on 22 November 1922, drawing to its livestock competitions 17,000 entries from several provinces and the United States. The fair then, save for the years when Canada was embroiled in the Second World War, consistently provided for farmers a forum to display equipment, discuss new trends, and showcase wares. In 1965, significant changes were introduced by the federal Department of Agriculture, which had been a longtime sponsor of The Royal. Both the number of livestock classes for each breed and the number of entries per breeder were reduced; new judging standards were set, emphasizing the utility of the breed; buildings were renovated, and the Winter Garden Show and Horse Show were given more prominence, the latter attracting some 75,000 viewers.

For the fair&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 1997 a commemorative stamp was issued by Canada Post.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 editions of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto were cancelled, as was the case for that summer&#x27;s Canadian National Exhibition and the Canadian International Air Show, also held at Exhibition Place.

==Programme==

Today, the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair sees over 320,000 visits including exhibitors, and international and local guests of all ages. Over 6,000 animals arrive in Toronto each November, including over 4,900 head of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, and fancy bird, and over 900 horses and ponies, plus numerous displays of crops and vegetables, educational exhibits, and feature attractions. The latter include The Royal Culinary Academy, which provides demonstrations and interactive opportunities for the public, food sampling, along with a wide variety of other education and entertainment features each day and evening. Evening events at the Fair include the iconic Royal Horse Show, dining in The Royal&#x27;s food venues, where guests can enjoy delicious cuisine made with the best of local products. Additionally, The Royal Animal Theatre showcases animals at work and play, including sheep-herding, goats on the go, Spirit of the Horse, rabbit jumping, and The SuperDogs. The Royal Horse Show features top international equestrians and has been a cornerstone of the fair since its inception.

Throughout the fair, guests are encouraged to feed and touch over 60 animals in the Petting Farm, discover the journey food takes from farm to fork, ask questions at one of 13 education centers—including beekeeping, alpaca and llama farms, dairy cow milking—and visit the barns to see animals and meet exhibitors.

<text>I-names are one form of an XRI — an OASIS open standard for digital identifiers designed for sharing resources and data across domains and applications. I-names are human readable XRIs intended to be as easy as possible for people to remember and use. For example, a personal i-name could be &quot;=Mary&quot; or &quot;=Mary.Jones&quot;. An organizational i-name could be &quot;@Acme&quot; or &quot;@Acme.Corporation&quot;.

==Persistence==

One problem XRIs are designed to solve is &quot;persistent addressing&quot; — how to maintain an address that does not need to change no matter how often the contact details of a person or organization change. XRIs accomplish this by adding a new layer of abstraction over the existing IP numbering and DNS naming layers used on the Internet today (as well as over other type of addresses, such as phone numbers or instant messaging addresses). Such an abstraction layer is not new — URNs (Uniform Resource Names) and other persistent identifier architectures have the same effect. What&#x27;s different about the XRI layer is that it offers a single uniform syntax and resolution protocol for two different types of identifiers:

===I-names===

I-names are identifiers resembling domain names, designed for simplicity and ease of use. Though typically long-lived, i-names may, like domain names, be transferred or reassigned to another resource by their owners. For example, a company that changes its corporate name could sell its old i-name to another company, while both companies could retain their original i-numbers. What most differentiates i-names from domain names is that in practice they will have a synonymous (equivalent) persistent &quot;i-number&quot; (below).

===I-numbers===

I-numbers are machine readable identifiers (similar to IP addresses) that are assigned to a resource (for instance, a person, organization, application or file) and never reassigned. This means an i-number can always be used to address a network representation of the resource as long it remains available anywhere on the network. I-numbers, like IP addresses, are designed to be efficient for network routers to process and resolve.

XRI syntax also allows i-names and i-numbers to be combined within the same XRI. So effectively the XRI layer supports both i-name and i-number synonyms for resources — one that reflects real-world semantics and can change over time, and one that reflects the persistent identity of a resource no matter how often its attributes (including its i-names) may change. And the same HTTP-based XRI resolution protocol can be used to resolve either an i-name or an i-number to an XRDS document describing the target resource.

XRIs are backward-compatible with the DNS and IP addressing systems, so it is possible for domain names and IP addresses to be used as i-names (or, in rare cases, as i-numbers). Like DNS names, XRIs can also be &quot;delegated&quot;, i.e., nested multiple levels deep, just like the directory names on a local computer file system. For example, a company can register a top-level (global) i-name for itself and then assign second- or lower-level (community) i-names to its divisions, employees, etc. Examples:

 =Mary.Jones*Henry
 @Example.Corp*Ecuador*Quito

i-names are called &quot;unified digital addresses&quot; because they can be resolved using the XRI resolution protocol into XRDS documents that expose various services for accessing the digital identity they represent. These services, such as OpenID, OAuth, or XDI can expose any other type of data under the control of this identity. Privacy is protected because the identity owner controls access. For example, the registrant of &quot;=Mary.Jones&quot; would not receive spam from this i-name because it is not an email address. To resolve &quot;=Mary.Jones&quot; into an email address would first require Mary&#x27;s permission, and such requests can be verified by i-brokers to make sure they are legitimate.

In addition to &quot;=names&quot; for people and &quot;@names&quot; for organizations, the third major type of i-names is &quot;+names&quot; for generic concepts. This is the XRI equivalent of a generic noun in the English language, for example, &quot;+flowers&quot;, &quot;+phone.number&quot;, or &quot;+table.of.contents&quot;. Generic &quot;+names&quot; are very useful in distributed data sharing because they can be used as XRI cross-references to specify the precise type of data to be shared. For example, &quot;=Mary.Jones/(+phone.number)/(+daytime)&quot; and &quot;@Acme/(+phone.number)/(+daytime)&quot; can be used to request Mary&#x27;s and Acme&#x27;s daytime phone numbers, respectively.

<text>Francesco Antonio Bonporti (11 June 1672 – 19 December 1749) was an Italian priest and amateur composer.

Born in Trento, he was admitted in 1691 to the &quot;Collegium Germanicum&quot; in Rome, where he studied theology. While in Rome, he also studied composition under the guidance of Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni and possibly (since this is unconfirmed) violin with Arcangelo Corelli.

Moving back to Trento, he was ordained in 1695.

Bonporti&#x27;s musical work consists of twelve &quot;opera&quot;, published between 1696 and 1736. He influenced Johann Sebastian Bach in the development of the invention, and several of his works were mistakenly included in a set of Bach&#x27;s inventions. In reality, Bach had transcribed for harpsichord four violin pieces from Bonporti&#x27;s op. X (1712).

He lived in Padua from 1740 until his death in 1749.

==Works==
This is a listing of his twelve &quot;opera&quot;, first the Italian original, generally by Giuseppe Sala in Venice, then the French edition as published by Estienne Roger in Amsterdam, and finally the English edition, by John Walsh in London. Not every &quot;opus&quot; seem to have survived in all three languages, as listed in an article published by &quot;Studi Trentini&quot; in 1973 by Clemente Lunelli. His sources on European editions are François Lesure&#x27;s &quot;Bibliographie des éditions musicales publiées par Estienne Roger...&quot;, Paris, 1969, and William C. Smith&#x27;s &quot;A bibliography of the musical works published by John Walsh...&quot;, London, 1968.

<text>Mabalacat, officially City of Mabalacat (; ), is a component city in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 293,244 people.

Mabalacat is in the urban core of Metro Clark, also known as Metro Angeles, an urban area in Pampanga. This area is considered the industrial and residential heartland of Central Luzon. Metro Clark is also identified as a regional center by the national government.

==Etymology==
Mabalacat&#x27;s name was derived from indigenous Negrito word &quot;mabalacat&quot; meaning &quot;forest of balacats&quot;, a species of tree that were prominent in the area.
==History==

Prior to 1712, Mabalacat was a barrio (barangay) of Bambang (now Bamban, Tarlac). It became a town in 1792, and was named after the abundant Balacat tree (&quot;Ziziphus talanai&quot;), a fourth class timber tree with bark that possess antimicrobial properties. Once a settlement of an Aeta tribe, the area was a virtual forest of balacat trees. &quot;Ma-balacat&quot; in the native Kapampangan language means &quot;full of Balacats.&quot; Mabalacat in Maranao is &quot;Mababaapalaqat&quot; (Palacat), which means &quot;maiksing hagdan&quot; in Tagalog.

In 1853, Mabalacat had a population of 2,611 and four barangays, namely, Babangdapu, Duquit, Malabni, and Paglimbunan. By 1903 its population increased to 7,049 in 19 barangays. These were Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Dau, Dolores, Iba, Mabiga, Mamatitang, Mangalit, Matas, Mawaque, Paralayunan, Poblacion, Quitangil (later renamed to San Francisco), San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Santa Maria, Sapang Balen, and Sapang Biabas. In 1948, Mabalacat&#x27;s barangays increased to 20 with the addition of Fort Stotsenburg.

In 1860, a military command was established by authorities of the Spanish Governor-General due to the lawlessness and depredations perpetrated by the negritos (Aetas, or derogatorily called &quot;balugas&quot;). The Pampanga towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Magalang, Porac, and Floridablanca and Mabalacat were created into what was called a &quot;Commandancia Militar&quot;. However, in 1873, the Military Command returned Mabalacat together with the towns of Magalang, Floridablanca, and Porac to the parent province, Pampanga.

===Cityhood===

The former municipality was officially upgraded to a city following a referendum on July 21, 2012, and became the third in Pampanga after Angeles City and San Fernando. It is home to roughly most of the Clark Freeport Zone, the rest in nearby Angeles, where the main gate is located. Clark International Airport, as well as the numerous hotels, casinos, golf courses, and resorts in Clark Freeport, are mostly situated in Mabalacat.

== Geography ==
Mabalacat has a land area of . It is from Manila, from Angeles, and from the provincial capital, San Fernando.

The soil is charcoal black and shiny, a sign of fertility, and is suitable for growing rice, sugarcane and other rootcrops. Like the neighbouring cities of Angeles and San Fernando and the towns/municipalities of Porac, Bacolor, Santa Rita, Mexico, Magalang and Arayat, this city rarely gets inundated by floods from heavy rains and typhoons because it is situated on an elevated, well-drained part of the Central Luzon plains known as the &quot;Upper Pampanga&quot;.

===Barangays===
Mabalacat is politically subdivided into 27 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Atlu-Bola (San Isidro)
* Bical (San Roque)

The largest barangay is Dau, which became a barrio in 1936 by virtue of &quot;Presidential Proclamation No. 1&quot;. It is now a business center whose commercial output runs parallel to that of downtown. A former terminus of the North Luzon Expressway, it is the most urban and most populous area in Mabalacat, home to roughly 23% of the city&#x27;s population.

San Francisco, the second largest barangay, along with San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Poblacion, Calumpang and other barangays are categorized as urban in view of their proximity to the city proper. Sapang Balen, with a population of 166 persons, is the smallest barangay.

<text>The 2010 United States Senate elections were held on November 2, 2010, from among the United States Senate&#x27;s 100 seats. A special election was held on January 19, 2010, for a midterm vacancy in Massachusetts. 34 of the November elections were for 6-year terms to the Senate&#x27;s Class 3, while other 3 were special elections to finish incomplete terms. Those 37 November elections featured 19 incumbent Democrats (7 of whom retired or were defeated in the primary) and 18 incumbent Republicans (8 of whom retired or were defeated in the primary).

After the 2008 elections, the Senate was composed of 58 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. However, in a January 2010 special election, Republicans picked up a seat in Massachusetts thereby reducing Democrats&#x27; majority to 57 seats.

Republicans won 4 seats held by retiring Democrats and also defeated 2 incumbent Democrats, for a Republican net gain of 6 seats. This was the first time since 1994 that Republicans successfully defended all of their own seats. This was also the fourth consecutive election of Class 3 senators where Democrats failed to gain seats. Despite the Republican gains, the Democrats retained a majority of the Senate with 51 seats plus the 2 Independents who caucused with them, compared to the 47 Republican seats. , this was the last time Republicans won U.S. Senate seats in Illinois and New Hampshire.

== Final pre-election predictions ==
Several sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for reelection) and the other candidates, and the state&#x27;s partisan lean (reflected in part by the state&#x27;s Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat.

* &quot;tossup&quot;: no advantage
* &quot;tilt&quot; (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as &quot;lean&quot;
* &quot;lean&quot;: slight advantage
* &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;favored&quot;: significant, but surmountable, advantage
* &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;: near-certain chance of victory

Where a site gives a percentage probability as its primary indicator of expected outcome, the chart below classifies a race as follows:
* Tossup: 50-55%
* Tilt: 56-60%
* Lean: 61-75%
* Likely: 76-93%
* Safe: 94-100%

== Alabama ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Shelby won re-election to a fifth term. On November 9, 1994, Shelby switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican, one day after the Republicans won control of both houses in the midterm elections, giving the Republicans a 53–47 majority in the Senate. He won his first full term as a Republican in 1998 by a large margin, and faced no significant opposition in 2004 and 2010.


Shelby had over $17 million in the bank, one of the highest of any candidate in the country. He had become even more popular in his opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.

In May, Shelby told reporters &quot;I don&#x27;t even know who my opponent is.&quot;




== Alaska ==

The November general election in Alaska was preceded by primary elections which were held August 24, 2010. Scott McAdams, the Mayor of Sitka, became the Democratic nominee and Joe Miller, an attorney and former federal magistrate, became the Republican nominee after defeating incumbent Senator Lisa Murkowski in the Republican primary.

Murkowski garnered more than 100,000 write-in votes in the general election, many of which were challenged by Miller for various errors including minor misspellings. The appeal was denied Even if all the challenged votes were thrown out, Murkowski would have still had a lead of over 2,100 votes.











== Arizona ==

Incumbent Republican John McCain, who returned to the Senate after losing the presidency to Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, ran for re-election to a fifth term and won.





After spending over $20 million during the primaries, McCain still had more than $1million cash on hand after the primary election. Glassman criticized McCain on women&#x27;s issues. In August 2010, Glassman released a TV advertisement called &quot;Arizona First.&quot;




== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat Blanche Lincoln ran for re-election to a third term, but lost to Republican nominee John Boozman. Boozman became the first Republican in 138 years to win the seat. Arkansas had previously only elected one Republican senator since the Reconstruction, who was defeated after his first term in 2002 by Mark Pryor.





The Republican primary was held May 18, 2010, with early voting from May 3–17.









== California ==

Incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer won re-election to a fourth term.

In 2009, Boxer was criticized for correcting a general who called her &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;. Brigadier General Michael Walsh was testifying on the Louisiana coastal restoration process in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and answered Boxer&#x27;s query with &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; when Boxer interrupted him. &quot;Do me a favor,&quot; Boxer said. &quot;can you say &#x27;senator&#x27; instead of &#x27;ma&#x27;am?&#x27;&quot; &quot;Yes, ma&#x27;am,&quot; Walsh interjected. &quot;It&#x27;s just a thing, I worked so hard to get that title, so I&#x27;d appreciate it. Thank you,&quot; she said. The Army&#x27;s guide to protocol instructs service members to call members of the U.S. Senate &quot;sir&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;senator&quot;. Fiorina used this incident prominently in campaign ads, as did David Zucker, who directed a humorous commercial for RightChange.com titled &#x27;Call Me Senator.&#x27; In February 2010, Carly Fiorina put out a campaign ad attacking Republican rival Tom Campbell featuring a &quot;demon sheep&quot;, creating international, mostly negative, publicity.









== Colorado ==

In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama selected incumbent U.S. Senator Ken Salazar to become U.S. Secretary of the Interior. After Salazar resigned from his seat, Democratic Governor Bill Ritter appointed Denver Public Schools Superintendent Michael Bennet to fill the seat, who won re-election to his first full term.





This was one of the most expensive elections in the 2010 cycle, with more than $50 million spent total, including over $35 million in outside spending. Conservative third party groups hammered Bennet for voting 92% of the time with the Democratic leadership, including voting for healthcare reform and the stimulus package. Liberal third party groups called Buck extremist. Bennet focused on attacking Buck&#x27;s views on abortion, which he believed should be banned including those of cases of rape and incest. He was also attacked for wanting to eliminate the Seventeenth Amendment and refusing to prosecute an alleged rapist as Weld County district attorney. Planned Parenthood mounted a mail campaign, targeting women voters with the warning that &quot;Colorado women can&#x27;t trust Ken Buck.&quot; Bennet won the women vote by 17 points according to exit polls. After the election, Buck conceded to the Denver Post that the main reason why he lost is because of social issues.




== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Christopher Dodd suffered from dropping approval ratings in the past few years due to major controversies, leading him to announce in January 2010 that he would retire, instead of seeking a sixth term. As Dodd was a Democrat, Richard Blumenthal, incumbent State Attorney General, announced on the same day that he would run for Dodd&#x27;s seat. The Connecticut Democratic Party nominated Blumenthal on May 21. Businesswoman Linda McMahon won the state party&#x27;s nominating convention and the August 10 Republican primary to become the Republican candidate.







== Delaware (special) ==

This was a special election to fill Delaware&#x27;s Class 2 Senate seat, then held by Ted Kaufman, an appointee. The seat had been previously held by long-time Senator Joe Biden, who vacated it when he became Vice President of the United States in 2009.







== Florida ==

Incumbent Republican Senator Mel Martínez, who was elected in a very close race against Democrat Betty Castor with 49% of the vote in 2004, announced on December 2, 2008, that he would not run for re-election to a second term, then announcing on August 7, 2009, that he would resign prior to the end of his term. The Governor of Florida, Republican Charlie Crist, was required to appoint a successor and he chose his former Chief of Staff, George LeMieux. LeMieux, a placeholder who did not run in the election, replaced Martínez in the Senate on September 10, 2009.

Crist publicly announced he was running for the seat in mid-2009. When he declared his candidacy, he received many Republican endorsements, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Martínez, and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. However, his support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives, and Tea Party candidate Marco Rubio, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, surged in the polls. In April 2010, Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. The National Republican Senatorial Committee withdrew its endorsement of Crist and demanded a refund of its campaign funds that it provided for the Crist campaign. Rubio went on to win the Republican primary against only token opposition.

Polling initially showed Crist neck and neck with Rubio, but by the end of August Rubio opened up a solid and consistent lead. He was supported by Republican and some Independent voters whereas Democratic and other Independents were split between Crist and Meek. Rubio went on to win the election with 49% of the vote to Crist&#x27;s 30% and Meek&#x27;s 20%.












== Georgia ==

Incumbent Republican Johnny Isakson won re-election to a second term.









== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat and President pro tempore Daniel Inouye won re-election to his ninth term.

Hawaii last elected a Republican Senator in 1970, and its current delegation to the United States Congress currently consists entirely of Democrats. Democrats have also won Hawaii&#x27;s electoral votes in every presidential election since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide election in 1984. The exceptions at the time were then-Governor Linda Lingle (who was serving her second and final term) and then-U.S. Representative Charles Djou, both of whom were Republicans.









== Idaho ==

Incumbent Republican Mike Crapo won re-election to a third term.




Sullivan, a heavy underdog, criticized Crapo for being in Washington for too long saying &quot;Senator Crapo has been in Congress for 18 years. The country is struggling, and I think it&#x27;s time to make a change.&quot; Crapo emphasized his conservative record in Washington.



== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Roland Burris did not run in 2010. He suffered from poor approval ratings and was investigated by the Sangamon County, Illinois State&#x27;s Attorney for perjury. Although no criminal charges were filed against him, he faced an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.

There were two ballot items for the same seat: a regular election, to fill the Class 3 seat beginning with the 112th United States Congress beginning on January 3, 2011, and a special election, to fill that seat for the final weeks of the 111th Congress, replacing the temporary appointment of Roland Burris to the vacancy created by Barack Obama&#x27;s election to the presidency.

A federal court ruled that the candidates appearing on the ballot for the replacement election would be the ones of the regular election, and that the special election would appear after the regular election on the ballot.

, this was the last Senate election in Illinois won by a Republican.















== Indiana ==

Incumbent Democrat Evan Bayh decided in February 2010 to retire instead of seeking a third term shortly after former U.S. Senator Dan Coats announced his candidacy for Bayh&#x27;s contested seat. No Democratic candidate submitted enough signatures by the deadline to run, leading Democratic officials to choose U.S. Congressman Brad Ellsworth to be the nominee. Coats won the election.



After Coats&#x27;s win in the Republican primary, Ellsworth began to heavily criticize Coats for his ties to lobbyists. He called for more disclosure of the meetings lawmakers have with lobbyists, banning congressional staff from lobbying for six years after their congressional jobs, requiring Congress members to put all their investments in blind trusts, more disclosure of Senate candidates&#x27; personal financial information, and changes to the U.S. Senate filibuster rules. He proposed lowering number of votes required to break a filibuster to 55 from the current 60. In response to Ellsworth&#x27;s charges, Coats published his lobbying record in an 815-page document.

Coats emphasized the individual issues rather than ethics reforms advocated by his opponent. He focused on Ellsworth&#x27;s record of voting in support of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, cap-and-trade legislation, and health care bill. Coats opinion of the healthcare law was that &quot;the only responsible solution ... is to repeal the Obama-Pelosi-Ellsworth health spending bill and quickly replace it with cost-effective, incremental pieces that will decrease costs, increase coverage and not break the bank.&quot;



== Iowa ==

Incumbent Republican Chuck Grassley won re-election to a sixth term.





Incumbent Chuck Grassley started the campaign moderately popular, but his approval ratings dropped somewhat during the campaign. However, the seat continued to be considered to be &quot;Safe Republican&quot; by many sources, with CQ Politics noting that Grassley is &quot;one of Iowa&#x27;s most durable politicians.&quot;

Conlin described herself as a &quot;prairie progressive.&quot; She supported the recent landmark case of Varnum v. Brien, which legalized gay marriage in the state. She also supported repeal of &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell.&quot;

Before the election, former political advisor John Maxwell claimed that Grassley would have his toughest race since his first U.S. Senate election in 1980, where he defeated incumbent John Culver with 53% of the vote. Grassley won all of his four re-election bids with nearly 70% of the vote against unknown opponents. Grassley won the election with 64.51% of the vote.





== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback retired to run for Governor of Kansas, instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Jerry Moran won the open seat. Kansas is one of the most Republican states in the nation; no Democrat has been elected to either Senate seat since 1932.




The retirement of Brownback, a popular U.S. Senator, led to a heavily competitive primary election. Tiahrt, who was on the Committee of Appropriations, had been accused of excessive earmarking while he was in Congress. From 2006 to 2008, Tiahrt had requested and supported a total of 63 solo earmarks, costing $53.9 million. In the same period, Moran had requested and supported a total of 29 earmarks, with a pricetag of $13.4 million.



After the primaries, Moran chose not to release any more negative advertisements. Democrat Lisa Johnston ran a low-profile, quiet race. On election day, she won only two counties: Wyandotte County and Douglas County, while Moran won statewide by a landslide.





== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Republican Jim Bunning retired instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Rand Paul won the open seat.

On May 18, 2010, Paul won the Republican nomination. After conceding the election to Paul, Grayson said, &quot;It&#x27;s time to put all differences aside, unite behind Dr. Paul, he needs our help and I for one stand ready to serve&quot;.






Grayson attacked Paul for his &quot;strange ideas,&quot; such as his opposition of the PATRIOT Act, and what Grayson alleged to be his support of closing down Guantanamo Bay and saying that Iran was not a threat. He also attacked Paul for being a Duke University fan. He sent out another TV ad and web video that stirred controversy by making the case that Paul believes that foreign policy decisions made prior to September 11, 2001, are partially to blame for the attacks. Paul immediately responded by launching a statewide television ad in which he expresses his &quot;outrage at terrorists who killed 3,000 innocents&quot; before accusing Grayson of a &quot;lie&quot; and a &quot;shameful&quot; tactic. Grayson accused the Fox News Channel of favoring Paul over him.

Conway began the race trailing Paul, but as he attacked his opponent&#x27;s positions on social-welfare and criminal-justice policies, the polls began to tighten. The campaign attracted $8.5 million in contributions from outside groups, of which $6 million was spent to help Rand Paul and $2.5 million to help Conway. This money influx was in addition to the money spent by the candidates themselves: $6 million by Paul and $4.7 million by Conway.




== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Republican David Vitter won re-election to a second term. Some speculated that Vitter&#x27;s re-election might have become complicated, by the prostitution scandal revealed in 2007, but he continued to lead in aggregate polling against potential opponents.





Melançon heavily criticized Vitter for prostitution sex scandal. Vitter released television advertising criticizing Melancon for his support for Obama&#x27;s stimulus package and his support for amnesty for illegal immigrants. Melancon claimed &quot;In August, Melancon challenged Vitter to a series of five live, televised town hall-style debates across the state. In his 2004 campaign for Senate, Vitter committed to five live, televised debates. Since Melancon issued the challenge, Vitter and Melancon have been invited to a total of seven live, televised debates. Vitter only accepted invitations to debates hosted by WWL-TV and WDSU-TV, both in New Orleans.&quot;






== Maryland ==

Incumbent Democrat Barbara Mikulski won re-election to a fifth term.









Republican nominee Eric Wargotz, Queen Anne&#x27;s County, Maryland Commission President and physician, compared Mikulski to a dinosaur by calling her a political &quot;insidersaurus&quot; for being in Washington for over thirty years An ad showed a hammer hitting a brick wall, breaking it down and citing criticisms of Mikulski&#x27;s record as a U.S. Senator. Mikulski released advertisements emphasizing education and job creation. Despite Wargotz&#x27;s limited campaign and resources he received the highest percentage of votes against Mikulski as an incumbent U.S. Senator




== Massachusetts (special) ==

A special election was held January 19, 2010 to fill the Class 1 seat for the remainder of the term ending January 3, 2013. It was won by Republican Scott Brown.

Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy had died on August 25, 2009. Governor of Massachusetts appointed Democrat Paul Kirk September 24, 2009, to continue the term pending this special election, in which Kirk was not a candidate.

The election was viewed by conservatives outside of Massachusetts as a referendum on President Barack Obama. However, Brown stated that he didn&#x27;t believe that it was a referendum on Obama. Although Democrats would retain control of both Houses of Congress until January 2011, Brown&#x27;s victory greatly affected their political plans, most notably for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, though the legislation was signed into law two months later. Brown became the first Republican to win this seat since 1946, and as of 2025, this is the last Senate election in Massachusetts won by a Republican.










== Missouri ==

Incumbent Republican Kit Bond retired instead of seeking a fifth term. Republican nominee Roy Blunt won the open seat.







Democrat Robin Carnahan and national Democrats heavily criticized Blunt for his support of bailouts, calling him &quot;Bailout Blunt.&quot; Blunt criticized her for supporting President Obama&#x27;s stimulus package, the cap-and-trade energy bill, and the health care reform bill.




== Nevada ==

Incumbent Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid won re-election to a fifth term.









Reid was initially considered vulnerable, with the non-partisan Cook Political Report rating the election as a toss-up and the Rothenberg Political Report rating the state as toss-up. A June 9, 2010, Rasmussen Reports post-primary poll showed Angle leading incumbent Senator Harry Reid by a margin of 50% to 39%. However, a July 2010 poll showed Senator Reid leading Angle by 7 points, following nationwide attention to some of Angle&#x27;s positions, as well as the endorsement of Reid by prominent Republicans. The change of margin, 18% in less than a month, is the largest in Senate elections history. On July 28, 2010, Rasmussen Reports moved the race from toss-up to leans Democratic. Later, it moved back to toss-up. Despite Angle leading by three points in the polls the days leading up to the election, Reid defeated her by 5.74%, even in her own county, Washoe County. Reid also secured huge numbers out of the Democratic stronghold of Clark County, which covers the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area. Angle&#x27;s far right beliefs and positions were also widely cited as a reason for the failure of the Republican Party defeating Reid.
 





== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican Judd Gregg retired instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican nominee Kelly Ayotte won the open seat by over 23 points, after winning a close party primary. New Hampshire trended Democratic in the 2006 and 2008 elections, with Republican incumbents losing both of the state&#x27;s House seats and its other Senate seat to Democrats, but polling conducted in late December 2008 showed Gregg defeating both of the state&#x27;s U.S. Representatives in a hypothetical match-up.



Democrat Paul Hodes called himself a fiscal conservative, which was mocked by Republican Kelly Ayotte in a TV ad. Hodes was criticized for supporting President Obama&#x27;s Economic Recovery package, a carbon energy tax, and Affordable Care Act. Hodes criticized Ayotte for numerous controversies. One ad was questioned Ayotte&#x27;s honesty in dealing with the Lakes Region Ponzi scheme which defrauded investors of almost $80 million.
 




== New York ==
There were two elections, due to the resignation of Hillary Clinton in January 2009 to become the U.S. Secretary of State. Both senate races, along with the New York gubernatorial election, one with a vulnerable Democratic incumbent and the other an open race, respectively, was believed to lead major New York Republicans to gravitate towards them rather than challenge the popular Schumer. As it happened, however, New York Republicans had difficulty drawing top-tier candidates to any of the three races.

=== New York (regular) ===

Incumbent Democrat Chuck Schumer won re-election to a third term.







=== New York (special) ===

Governor David Paterson had appointed Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand to serve as United States Senator this special election, replacing former Senator Hillary Clinton, who resigned to serve as U.S. Secretary of State in the Barack Obama administration. The winner of the special election would complete the term ending in January 2013. Due to this special election, this was the first time since the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913 that all of New York&#x27;s six statewide offices were up for popular election on the same date.

Gillibrand claimed to be an independent thinker who took a back seat to no one. She also released television advertising touting her background from upstate New York while DioGuardi criticized Gillibrand&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.












== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Burr won re-election to a second term. Burr was the first incumbent to win re-election for this seat since Sam Ervin&#x27;s last re-election in 1968. Burr&#x27;s 54.8% also represented the highest vote share a North Carolina Republican received since the state began directly electing its senators.

This Senate seat was unfavorable to incumbents over the past several decades. No person elected to this seat was re-elected since Sam Ervin in 1968. His successor, Democrat Robert Burren Morgan, was defeated for re-election in 1980, along with many other incumbents from his party. His Republican successor, John Porter East, committed suicide in 1986. East&#x27;s appointed successor, Jim Broyhill, served for just four months, resigning upon his November 1986 election loss to former Democratic Governor Terry Sanford. In 1992, the seat changed hands yet again, as Sanford was defeated by wealthy GOP businessman Lauch Faircloth, who himself lost in his bid for a second term six years later by John Edwards. In 2004, no incumbent was defeated, as Edwards was running for vice president and was not allowed to be on the ballot in both races. However, that year the seat did change parties for the fifth time in a row, with Richard Burr defeating Bill Clinton&#x27;s onetime Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles.




* Note: Since no candidate received 40% of the vote on May 4, state law allowed a runoff (or &quot;second primary&quot;) election if requested by the second-place finisher. Cunningham requested such a runoff.









== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Democrat Byron Dorgan did not seek re-election. Republican Governor John Hoeven won the open seat. Incumbent Byron Dorgan never had a difficult time getting elected, as he obtained 59%, 63%, and 68% in his three senate election bids, respectively. However, in December 2009, Rasmussen Reports conducted a hypothetical matchup of Governor John Hoeven against the incumbent. Hoeven led by a large margin, 58% to Dorgan&#x27;s 36%. 61% of the state still had a favorable view of Dorgan, and if pitted against State Senator Duane Sand, the incumbent led 52% to 37%.

Hoeven was challenged in the race by North Dakota State Senator Tracy Potter of Bismarck. Potter received the endorsement of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party at its state convention on March 27, 2010. Governor Hoeven and Senator Potter advanced to the November 2, 2010 general election following balloting in North Dakota&#x27;s primary election, which was held June 8, 2010. Neither candidate faced any significant opposition in the primary election.







== Ohio ==

Incumbent Republican George Voinovich retired instead of seeking a third term. Republican former Director of the Office of Management and Budget, United States Trade Representative, and Congressman Rob Portman won the open seat.




Originally, the election was seen as a toss-up. His experience as a former Bush official was considered to be a big problem for Portman. Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Fisher. Television advertisements were very negative. Fisher attacked Portman for helping to ship jobs overseas during his entire political career, backing deals that shipped jobs overseas, and the trade deficit with China, which grew by over $41 billion. Portman claimed in response that most jobs were being lost to other states, not countries. Portman attacked Fisher for supporting Obama&#x27;s stimulus and cap and trade.

Winning the election, Portman received the majority of votes in 82 of 88 counties and in 15 of 18 Congressional districts, including the district of liberal U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich.




== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent first-term Republican Tom Coburn won re-election to a second term. Coburn, a very popular incumbent, promised to limit himself to two terms. Despite his popularity, he did release television advertisements. In 2009, Coburn&#x27;s approval rating in a PPP poll was 59%, including a 39% approval rating among Democrats. His Democratic opponent is a perennial candidate who did little campaigning.








== Oregon ==

Incumbent Democrat Ron Wyden won re-election to a third full term. Wyden, a popular incumbent with a 52% approval rating in a July poll, touted bipartisanship and promised to hold town-hall meetings annually in each of Oregon&#x27;s 36 counties and to open offices outside of Portland and Salem. A Survey USA poll taken a few days before the election showed that 23% of Republicans supported Wyden.

Huffman, widely considered as an underdog, financed his own campaign. He defended bonuses for Wall Street executives and questioned global warming.












== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican-turned-Democrat Arlen Specter ran for re-election to a sixth term, but he lost in the Democratic primary to Joe Sestak. Republican nominee Pat Toomey then won the seat.






== South Carolina ==

Incumbent Republican Jim DeMint won re-election to a second term. Alvin Greene, the Democratic nominee, was the first major-party African-American U.S. Senate candidate in South Carolina since Reconstruction. Alvin Greene&#x27;s Democratic primary election win and his margin of victory surprised pundits. As of the primary, he had held no public campaign events, raised no money, and did not have a campaign website. A review of the primary election showed that of the state&#x27;s 46 counties, half had a significant gap between the absentee and primary day ballots. For example, in Lancaster County, Vic Rawl won the absentees with 84 percent, while Greene won primary day by a double-digit margin. Rawl&#x27;s campaign manager also claimed, &quot;In only two of 88 precincts, do the number of votes Greene got plus the number we got equal the total cast.&quot;








== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican John Thune won re-election to a second term unopposed.

Thune was narrowly elected to his first term over Democratic Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle with 51% of the vote in 2004. In spite of his lack of seniority, Thune rose to the position of chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the United States Senate.

No members of the South Dakota Democratic Party (or any other party) filed to challenge Thune. Scott Heidepriem, the South Dakota Senate Minority Leader and a Democratic candidate for Governor of South Dakota, said, &quot;We just concluded that John Thune is an extremely popular senator who is going to win another term in the Senate.&quot;
== Utah ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Bennett was seeking re-election to a fourth term, but was eliminated in the GOP state convention. Republican Mike Lee, who won the Republican primary, won the open seat.

At the Republican convention, incumbent Senator Bob Bennett finished third in balloting among delegates and was eliminated from the race. Business owner Tim Bridgewater finished first and attorney Mike Lee finished second, but Bridgewater did not receive enough votes to avoid a primary election runoff against Lee. At the Democratic convention, delegates nominated businessman Sam Granato, who received 77.5 percent of the vote.








== Vermont ==

Incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy easily won re-election to a seventh term.








== Washington ==

Incumbent Democrat Patty Murray won re-election to a fourth term.

Republican Dino Rossi heavily criticized Murray for her support of the 2009 economic stimulus package; however, Rossi&#x27;s economic promises are nearly identical to those of President Bush who asked for the stimulus. Rossi supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He also criticized Murray for her support for earmarks. In response, Murray said, &quot;You bet that seniority and leadership has a big thing to do with it, but the other part of it is, I get up every day and I work hard and I believe in this and I am going to continue fighting for the community I represent.&quot;










== West Virginia (special) ==

Long-time Democratic Senator Robert Byrd died June 28, 2010, and Democratic Governor Joe Manchin appointed Carte Goodwin to temporarily fill the vacancy. Goodwin pledged to not run for election to the seat in exchange for the appointment. Manchin won the open seat and served out the remainder of Byrd&#x27;s elected term, which ended on January 3, 2013.

During the Republican primary campaign, only Raese and Warner released television advertisements.












== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Democrat Russ Feingold ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by political newcomer, Republican Ron Johnson. Johnson, a millionaire manufacturer and Tea Party movement favorite who was running for his first political office, was the front runner. In response to controversy over his ownership of stock in BP, Johnson said he would sell it when market conditions were favorable and possibly use the proceeds to help finance his Senate campaign. Feingold&#x27;s first television ad was a positive ad released in March. In July 2010, Feingold&#x27;s second 2010 television election ad attacked Johnson for alleged support for offshore drilling in the Great Lakes. Johnson quickly countered Feingold with a television ad of his own. Feingold&#x27;s logo was &quot;Moving Forward&quot;. In one ad he emphasized independence and called himself a &quot;Penny Pincher.&quot; Johnson argued that his professions, manufacturer and accountant were underrepresented in the U.S. Senate, and there were too many lawyers (57 out of 100 members), including Feingold.

<text>A trust federation is part of the evolving Identity Metasystem that will bring a new layer of persistent identity and trusted data sharing to the Internet. Although the concept of trust federations is technology neutral, several protocols like SAML, OpenID, Information Card, XDI can handle the challenges of technical interoperability. The challenge of business and social interoperability requires a new type of cooperative association similar to a credit card association. Instead of banks, however, a trust federation is an alliance of i-brokers and their customers who agree to abide by a common set of agreements in the care and handling of customer data. A model for trust federations is offered by Open Identity Exchange and Kantara Initiative, which is applied in the U.S. Government ICAM Trust Framework.

Some operational trust federations are:
* InCommon (academic, USA)
* REFEDs (Research and Education Federations, Europe)
* IGTF Interoperable Global Trust Federation
* Portalverbund Government Portal Federation, Austria

Trust federations are not limited to the social web use case, but apply to all federations where trust in identity and compliance to other objectives of information security such as confidentiality, integrity and privacy is brokered.
