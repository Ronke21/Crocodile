<text>Printer-friendly is a term used on the Internet to describe a version of a web page formatted for printing. Normally, web pages include information and navigation content that is only useful while browsing the website. Printer-friendly pages are designed to fit on an 8.5&quot;x11&quot; or A4 sheet (see paper sizes) and include only the content (plain text and images) of the page, along with source information. Inline hyperlinks become ordinary text, links on the margins may or may not be shown. Additionally link target URLs may be shown. Navigation tools such as on-screen menus are not included.

Printer-friendly pages are used not only for printing onto paper, but also for storage on machine-readable media such as hard drives, floppy disks or CD-ROMs.
They are usually accessed through a link on the standard page. Often the link will be indicated by a printer icon.

There are several ways that website pages can be easily made printer friendly. One way is to use JavaScript, which can be used to create a printer-friendly version of a website page by hiding elements of the page that are not required for printing. This way, all of the content can be laid out on an 8.5&quot;x11&quot; or A4 sheet in an orderly fashion. Another way to create printer-friendly web pages is to use a CSS style sheet. A CSS style sheet is a set of instructions that tell the web browser how to display a web page. By using a separate style sheet specifically for printing, a web page can be laid out to fit on an 8.5&quot;x11&quot; or A4 sheet. The most important thing to remember when creating printer-friendly web pages is to keep the layout simple. Avoid using complicated text formatting and images, as these can cause problems when printing. Also, remember to include source information on the page, such as the website address and the date the page was printed.

<text>The Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas (IFPG; ), also known as the Dehghani faction () after its leader Ashraf Dehghani, is an Iranian communist organization that split from the Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas (OIFPG) in 1979, dropping the word &quot;organization&quot; from its name.

Dehghani broke away from the OIFPG when she accused it of deviating from the strategy of guerrilla warfare. From the early days of Iranian Revolution, the group claimed to be the &quot;sole genuine communist organization&quot; and opposed the Islamic Republic. Reportedly, as much as 30% of OIFPG members joined the group and fought in the 1979 Kurdish rebellion against government forces, backing the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Surviving members of the group and its factions moved to Europe in the 1990s. Currently, IFPG publishes two publications &quot;Payam Fadaei&quot; and &quot;19 Bahman&quot; in the Persian language.

<text>Kim Dovey is an Australian architectural and urban critic and Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the University of Melbourne, Australia, teaching and researching architecture and urban design. 
Born in Western Australia he received degrees from Curtin University and the University of Melbourne, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, USA. He has lectured and broadcast widely on social issues in architecture and urban design. His book Framing Places (2nd ed. 2008) explores theories of place as mediators of power, incorporating case studies of politics of public space, housing, shopping malls and corporate towers. Becoming Places (2010) explores the formation of place identity and develops a theory of place as dynamic assemblage. Urban Design Thinking (2016) is a broad-ranging application of assemblage thinking in urban design. Mapping Urbanities (2017) demonstrates applied research using urban mapping in the production of spatial knowledge. He has made significant contributions to theories of place, homelessness, transit-oriented development, urban density, walkability, informal settlement and creative clusters. He is co-author of the Urban DMA theory of walkability. The Atlas of Informal Settlement (2023) is the first global comparative study of informal urban design, and the theory of inventraset assemblages demonstrates how informal street vending, transport and settlement mesh within global South cities. He is Co-Director of the InfUr- research hub at the University of Melbourne. 

In November 2022 he was elected a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia.

<doc id="1131805" wikidata="Q3352360" url="?curid=1131805" title="Once There Was a War">
<text>Once There Was a War, published in 1958, is a collection of articles written by John Steinbeck while he was a special war correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; from June to December 1943.

Steinbeck&#x27;s articles include descriptions of life on a troop transporter, an account of the liberation of a small Sicilian town, a description of how homesick US soldiers tried to grow their native vegetables in the English gardens where they billeted, and an account of how a detachment of US paratroopers tricked the German garrison at Ventotene into surrendering.

Steinbeck did not report &#x27;straight news&#x27;, as he put it: he did not cover battles, or interview national or military leaders. As befitted the author of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, Steinbeck wrote about the experiences of the ordinary people, those who were doing the actual fighting, and those who did the vast number of unglamorous but vital support jobs which kept the armed forces operating.

In his Introduction, Steinbeck confesses that he felt &#x27;a visitor&#x27; to the war, and was uncomfortable knowing that he could go home at any time, while the serving personnel could not. For this reason, he said, &#x27;I never admitted to seeing anything myself, but always put my story in the mouth of another.&#x27; How much of his reporting is therefore of the &#x27;eyewitness&#x27; class cannot be determined. For example, his descriptions of American and British torpedo boats in action against German forces seem like first-hand accounts, yet he nowhere refers to himself as present, despite his inclusion of convincing dialogue and detail. However, in his &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, Steinbeck mentions wearing a naval officer&#x27;s cap, &#x27;Given me by a British torpedo boat captain, a very gentle gentleman and a murderer,&#x27; which phrase suggests that Steinbeck may well have observed action at first hand.

<doc id="1131806" wikidata="Q461571" url="?curid=1131806" title="Naomi Mitchison">
<text>Naomi Mary Margaret Mitchison, Baroness Mitchison (; 1 November 1897 – 11 January 1999) was a Scottish novelist and poet. Often called a doyenne of Scottish literature, she wrote more than 90 books of historical and science fiction, travel writing and autobiography. Her husband Dick Mitchison&#x27;s life peerage in 1964 entitled her to call herself Lady Mitchison, but she never did. Her 1931 work, &quot;The Corn King and the Spring Queen&quot;, is seen by some as the prime 20th-century historical novel.

==Childhood, family background and early career==
Naomi Mary Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh, the daughter and younger child of the physiologist John Scott Haldane and his wife (Louisa) Kathleen Trotter. Naomi&#x27;s parents came from different political backgrounds, her father being a Liberal and her mother from a Conservative, pro-imperialist family. However, both were of landed stock; the Haldane family had been feudal barons of Gleneagles since the 13th century. Today the best-known member of the family is probably Naomi&#x27;s elder brother, the biologist J. B. S. Haldane (1892–1964), but in her youth her paternal uncle Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, twice Lord Chancellor (from 1912 to 1915 under H. H. Asquith, and in 1924 during the first Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald), was better known.

Naomi followed her brother to the Oxford Preparatory School (later Dragon School) in 1904–1911, as the only girl there. From 1911, she was tutored at home by a governess. She qualified for the University of Oxford in 1914, via the Oxford higher local examination and entered the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne&#x27;s College) to pursue a degree course in science. However, she chose before completing the course to become a nurse, as the First World War had broken out. After a course in first aid and home nursing in 1915, she joined a Voluntary Aid Detachment at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London. Her service was much curtailed after she caught scarlet fever.

The Haldanes were known for their self-styled domestic experiments. She and her brother John started investigating Mendelian genetics in 1908. They initially used guinea pigs as experimental models, but changed to mice as they were more convenient to handle. Their findings were published as &quot;Reduplication in Mice&quot; in 1915. This was in fact the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals.

Mitchison was a prolific writer of more than 90 books in her lifetime, across a multitude of styles and genres. These include historical novels such as her first novel &quot;The Conquered&quot; (1923), set in Gaul in the 1st century BCE, during the Gallic Wars of Julius Caesar, and her second novel &quot;Cloud Cuckoo Land&quot; (1925) set in 5th-century BCE Ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War. Her best work is thought to be &quot;The Corn King and the Spring Queen&quot; (1931), which treats three different societies, including a wholly fictional one, and explores themes of sexuality that were daring in her day. Terri Windling called it &quot;a lost classic&quot;. Literary critic Geoffrey Sadler stated of Mitchison&#x27;s historical fiction: &quot;On the basis of her early writings, she is unquestionably one of the great historical novelists.&quot;

In 1932, Mitchison was commissioned by Victor Gollancz to edit a guide to the modern world for children. Mitchison&#x27;s book, &quot;An Outline for Boys and Girls and Their Parents&quot;, included several distinguished contributors, including W. H. Auden, Richard Hughes, Gerald Heard, and Olaf Stapledon. On publication, &quot;An Outline&quot; was praised by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman &quot;and the &quot;London Mercury&quot;. However, several clergymen, including the Archbishop of York, were angered by the book&#x27;s lack of emphasis on Christianity, while other right-wing authors objected to a perceived sympathy with the Soviet Union. The Conservative writer Arnold Lunn wrote a lengthy attack on the book in the &quot;English Review&quot;, which contributed to its commercial failure.

Undoubtedly her most controversial work, &quot;We Have Been Warned&quot;, was published in 1935, based on a journey to the Soviet Union. In it she explored sexual behaviour, including rape and abortion. The book was rejected by various publishers and ultimately censored. She approached first her friend Victor Gollancz, who flatly turned her down, observing that &quot;publication of the book would cause a real outcry.&quot; The book was extensively rewritten to make it more acceptable to publishers, and was still subject to censorship. On publication it was universally despised for its depiction of rape, free love and abortion that &quot;alienated readers on the left and horrified those on the political right.&quot; In 2005, files from the National Archives revealed that the British government had considered prosecuting the publishers of &quot;We Have Been Warned&quot;, but ultimately decided not to do so.

Mitchison was a compulsive writer, as her travelogues revealed. She wrote on planes or in trains as prompted by the situation. For example, she wrote up a visit to the US in the 1930s, objecting to sharecropping.

Her 1938 book &quot;The Moral Basis of Politics&quot; was a treatise on ethics and politics that she had worked on for three years. In it she defended the right of the left-wing journalist H. N. Brailsford to criticise the Moscow Trials, which had caused controversy on the British left at the time.

Mitchison&#x27;s &quot;The Blood of the Martyrs&quot; (1939) is set against the background of Nero&#x27;s persecution of the Christians. She draws parallels between Nero and dictators of her own time, Mussolini and Hitler.

In 1952, Mitchison went to Moscow as a member of the Authors&#x27; World Peace Appeal. She frequently visited Africa, especially Botswana, where she was made a sort of tribal mother (&quot;Mmarona&quot;) to the baKgatla people. &quot;Mucking Around&quot; (1981) best describes her haphazard travels in five continents over 50 years.

Her later works included further historical novels: &quot;The Bull Calves&quot; (1947) about the Jacobite rising of 1745 and &quot;The Young Alexander the Great&quot; (1960). She also turned to fantasy, such as &quot;Graeme and the Dragon&quot; (1954, Graeme Mitchison being a grandson through Denis), science fiction such as &quot;Memoirs of a Spacewoman&quot; (1962) and &quot;Solution Three&quot; (1975), fantasy such as the humorous Arthurian novel &quot;To the Chapel Perilous&quot; (1955), non-fiction such as &quot;African Heroes&quot; (1968), and also children&#x27;s novels, poetry, travel and a three-volume autobiography. She was unsure exactly how many books she had written, often claiming there were about 70. The articles were uncountable, from book reviews for the old &quot;Time and Tide&quot; magazine and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; to practical essays on farming, campaigning articles, recollections and reflections.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Mitchison wrote several memoirs, published as separate titles between 1973 and 1985. She was also a good friend of the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, and one of the proof readers of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Maxim Lieber served as her literary editor in 1935.

==Activism==
Mitchison, like her brother, was a committed socialist in the 1930s. She visited the Soviet Union in 1932 as part of a Fabian Society group and expressed some misgivings about the direction of Soviet society. An active anti-fascist, Mitchison travelled to Austria, where she undertook the risky task of smuggling documents and left-wing refugees out of the country. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate for the Scottish Universities in 1935, at a time when universities were still allowed to elect MPs. Eventually, as her political candidacy and her pro-Left writings had failed, she gradually became disenchanted with the Left. At that time, she became politically attracted to Scottish Nationalism and increasingly wrote on specifically Scottish issues and themes. She supported the Scottish National Party candidate, William Power in the parliamentary by-election for the Argyllshire constituency in 1940. Later she became active in the Scottish Convention launched by John MacCormick in 1943, serving on its education committee. Her name was on George Orwell&#x27;s list of people, prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department (IRD) set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government, who were considered to have pro-communist leanings and so be inappropriate to write for the IRD.

Mitchison&#x27;s advocacy continued in other ways. She was councillor for the East Kintyre ward on Argyll County Council from 1945 to 1966. She initiated the council&#x27;s school picture scheme under which a fund was established to purchase paintings by contemporary Scottish artists and loan them to schools. The paintings acquired included works by Joan Eardley, Robin Philipson, Anne Redpath and William MacTaggart. She served on the Highland Panel in 1947–1965 and the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council in 1966–1976. She became a spokeswoman for the island communities of Scotland. She was a friend of Seretse Khama and an advisor to the Bakgatla tribe of Botswana. Meanwhile she was a serious botanist, gardener and practical farmer.

Mitchison was a vocal campaigner for women&#x27;s rights, advocating birth control, and was elected a Life Fellow of the Eugenics Society in 1925 before leaving in objection to the group&#x27;s politics. Her own lack of knowledge of birth control (as stated in her memoirs) led to an interest in the causes of birth control and abortion. She was on the founding council of North Kensington Women&#x27;s Welfare Centre in London in 1924. Today, she is best known for her advocacy of feminism and her tackling of then-taboo subjects in her writing. She was a principal investor in the Partisan Coffee House, a meeting place for the New Left off Soho Square, which functioned in 1958–1962.

Mitchison was present and supporting a Stop the Seventy Tour rally, aiming to halt the apartheid South African rugby and cricket tours of Britain in December 1969.

==Later life==

Her husband Dick Mitchison predeceased her in 1970, but she remained active as a writer well into her nineties. Mitchison was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 New Year Honours. In her old age she was anxious and depressed about the future, particularly the misuse of scientific development such as nuclear arms. She stated that to experience two world wars in a lifetime was too much. On the other hand, she never exhausted the Haldanes&#x27; eccentricity, and once remarked in her biography in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; that her recreation was &quot;burning rubbish&quot;.

When asked on her 90th birthday whether she had regrets in life, she replied: &quot;Yes, all the men I never slept with. Imagine!&quot;

She died at Carradale on 11 January 1999 at the age of 101, and was cremated at the Clydebank crematorium on 16 January. Her ashes were then scattered there.

== Marriage and family ==
On 11 February 1916, Naomi married the barrister Gilbert Richard Mitchison (23 March 1894 – 14 February 1970), who was a close friend of her brother. Mitchison was then on leave from the Western Front; like her, he came from a well-connected and wealthy family. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, then a Labour politician, and eventually (on 5 October 1964) a life peer as Baron Mitchison of Carradale in the County of Argyll, on retirement for his political work. Naomi thus became Lady Mitchison as the wife of a life peer, but she objected to the title. She played an active part in her husband&#x27;s political career and in his constituency duties.

Dick and Naomi Mitchison&#x27;s marriage was not wholly satisfactory. After some years they both agreed to an open marriage, in which they entered into several other relationships that were conducted with dignity and described with humour. Her first serious lover was the Oxford classicist Theodore Wade-Gery, whose scholarship she drew on in writing her historical novels. As described in her autobiography, &quot;You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920–1940&quot;, she fell deeply in love with Wade-Gery. She wrote him love poems and missed him greatly after he broke off the relationship, considering it incompatible with his marriage to another woman in 1928. She mitigated her sorrow by undertaking a risky mission to help persecuted socialists in fascist-dominated Austria. Later, she had several briefer, less intense affairs, in which the men were in love with her and she did her best to reciprocate. As she emphasized in describing these, she took care to use contraceptives with her lovers and to let her children be fathered by her husband alone – although she dreamed of a future in which her daughters would be able to &quot;have children by several chosen fathers, uncensured&quot;.

Naomi and Dick had seven children. Their four sons were Geoffrey (1918–1927), who died of meningitis, Denis (1919–2018), a professor of bacteriology, Murdoch (1922–2011), and Avrion (1928–2022), both professors of zoology. Their three daughters were Lois (born 1926), Valentine (born 1928), and Clemency, who died in 1940, shortly after her birth.

Between 1923 and 1939, they lived at Rivercourt House, Upper Mall, Hammersmith, London. They bought the Carradale House at Carradale in Kintyre in 1939, where they lived for the rest of their lives. The house was frequented by people of all sorts: lords, ladies, politicians, writers, neighbours, fishermen and farmers. She and Denis MacIntosh, a local fisherman, wrote a documentary, &quot;Men and Herring: A Documentary&quot;, in 1949. Ten years later, this was adapted for BBC Television as a docudrama, &quot;Spindrift&quot;.

<text>Lilius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It lies to the north of the crater Zach, and south-southwest of Cuvier. Just to the southeast is the slightly larger Jacobi. The crater is named after the inventor of the Gregorian calendar, Aloysius Lilius.

The outer rim of Lilius has been worn down and rounded, particularly to the northwest where the inner wall protrudes farther into the interior floor. The lowest portion of the rim is to the south, adjacent to a crater attached to the southeast part of the outer wall. The interior floor is relatively flat and featureless, but there is a wide, domed central peak at the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lilius.

<text>Joel K. &quot;Jay&quot; Furr (born 1967 in Roanoke, Virginia) is an American writer and software trainer, notable as a Usenet personality in the early and mid-1990s.

According to Brad Templeton, Furr is one of the earliest people to refer to unsolicited electronic messages as &quot;spam&quot;. The term &quot;spam&quot; had been widely used by Monty Python fans to describe excessive torrents of verbiage on electronic chat systems and multi-user dungeons, analogous to the Vikings chanting &quot;Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!&quot; in the famous Python sketch. Furr used the term in the Usenet newsgroup news.admin.policy to describe an out-of-control automated robo-moderation system known as ARMM. While he didn&#x27;t coin the phrase, he appears to have been the first to use it to describe the phenomenon as it applied to USENET newsgroups.

Furr created a line of Usenet kook T-shirts, which included a &quot;Serdar Argic World Tour&quot; shirt as well as one imprinted with the programming code for RSA encryption, boasting &quot;This shirt is a munition&quot;, a reference to US export law.

He is an alumnus of the University of Georgia and its Demosthenian Literary Society.

Furr serves as the official &quot;Weigher of Coal&quot; for Richmond, Vermont. Furr appeared in the editorial pages of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; on May 11, 2018, with an editorial noting that despite having no official duties whatsoever as Weigher of Coal, he is still required to follow strict ethical standards.

<text>Lovelace is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just behind the northern limb. It lies to the south-southwest of the crater Hermite, and just to the north of the slightly smaller Froelich. To the east is Sylvester.

The outer wall of this crater is nearly circular, with a well-delineated rim that is not significantly worn. The inner wall is somewhat worn and the features softened and rounded, but is not marked by any small craters of significance. The inner wall is narrower along the northern rim than elsewhere. The interior floor is level, with a central peak that is offset just to the south of the midpoint.

<doc id="1131832" wikidata="Q714721" url="?curid=1131832" title="The Muppet Christmas Carol">
<text>The Muppet Christmas Carol is a 1992 American Christmas musical film directed by Brian Henson (in his feature directorial debut), and the fourth theatrical film featuring the Muppets. Adapted from the 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens with a screenplay written by Jerry Juhl, the film takes artistic license to suit the aesthetic of the Muppets, but follows Dickens&#x27; original story closely. This is the first Muppet film where a human is the main protagonist. 

The film stars Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge alongside Muppet performers Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz. It is the first Muppet film to be produced following the deaths of creator Jim Henson and performer Richard Hunt; the film is dedicated to both.

The film was released in the United States on December 11, 1992, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution under its Walt Disney Pictures label. It was a modest box office success and received generally favorable reviews. It is the first Muppets film to be produced by Disney, whose parent company would later acquire the rights to the Muppets characters and assets in 2004. The film&#x27;s reputation has grown in the years since its release, and it is often listed as one of the best Christmas films of all-time.

==Plot==

Charles Dickens (Gonzo) and his friend Rizzo narrate the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy, rude, penny-pinching and lonely moneylender of nineteenth century London, who does not share the merriment of Christmas. On Christmas Eve he rejects his nephew Fred&#x27;s invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen (Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker) collecting money for charity, and hurls a wreath at a carol-singing Bean Bunny. His kind, humble employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and the other bookkeepers request to not work on Christmas Day, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. That night, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley, (Statler and Waldorf) in his bed chambers. They warn him to repent his wicked ways, or be condemned to wearing chains and to suffer in the afterlife as they do and that three spirits will visit him during the night.

At one o&#x27;clock Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past, who shows him visions of his childhood and early adult life. Along with Dickens and Rizzo, they visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee at Fozziwig&#x27;s (Fozzie Bear) rubber chicken factory. There, at Fozziwig&#x27;s Christmas party, Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love but loses as he chooses money over her. A despondent Scrooge tells the Ghost to leave him and is returned to his home.

Scrooge next meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred&#x27;s house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit&#x27;s house, learning his family is content with the little they have. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob&#x27;s ill son Tiny Tim, (Robin the Frog) whom the Ghost comments will soon die if things continue the way they are. The Ghost leaves Scrooge. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from the inhabitants of London and the stolen possessions of the deceased are sold to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost also shows Scrooge the Cratchits&#x27; home, where they find Bob and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. Scrooge is led to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the neglected grave of the unloved man; Scrooge wipes the snow away on the tombstone to see it bears his name. Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom, where he discovers it is Christmas Day. 

An overjoyed Scrooge begins spreading happiness and joy around London, agreeing to give money to the gentlemen&#x27;s charity and reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge has Bean buy the poulterer&#x27;s prized turkey, and they, along with Dickens, Rizzo, and the gentlemen, deliver it to Bob&#x27;s family. Scrooge tells Bob he will raise his salary and pay off his mortgage, Dickens tells that Tiny Tim escaped death thanks to Scrooge&#x27;s new generosity, and everyone celebrates Christmas together.

==Production==
Following Jim Henson&#x27;s death in May 1990, the talent agent Bill Haber approached Henson&#x27;s son Brian, with the idea of filming an adaptation. Haber told Henson that &quot;&quot;Christmas Carol&quot; is the greatest story of all time, you should do that&quot; and later informed Henson that he had sold the idea to ABC as a television film. The longtime Muppets writer Jerry Juhl was hired to write the script and decided to insert Charles Dickens (portrayed by Gonzo) as the stand-in narrator in order to remain faithful to the original prose of the written material. Henson stated that Gonzo was chosen because he was the least likely choice to play Dickens, while Rizzo the Rat was added to inject some humor and serve as a Greek chorus. Established Muppet characters were initially written to portray the ghosts, with various accounts stating Robin the Frog or Scooter was to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, Miss Piggy to be the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Gonzo (before he was written to portray Dickens) or Animal as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of new Muppet characters that would better underline the ghosts&#x27; ominous nature. After the script was submitted for approval to ABC, the executives of Walt Disney Pictures offered to purchase the script for a feature film instead of a television release.

The English actors David Hemmings, Ron Moody, and David Warner and the American comedian George Carlin were considered to portray Ebenezer Scrooge. Henson later offered the role to Michael Caine, who replied: &quot;I&#x27;m going to play this movie like I&#x27;m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.&quot; He took inspiration for the role from &quot;Wall Street cheats and embezzlers; I thought they represented a very good picture of meanness and greed.&quot;

Production took place at the Shepperton Studios, England. During filming, in order to allow for the Muppets and the human actors to be in the shot, floors had to be removed and re-inserted, with Michael Caine having to walk across narrow planks between the Muppets and their performers. Additionally, the buildings in the London street scenes were constructed by hand but diminished in size in order to achieve the appearance that the streets were relatively longer. When the musical sequence &quot;It Feels Like Christmas&quot; ends with a crane shot, the short buildings became apparent in the background; Brian Henson explained on the DVD audio commentary that they were aware of the problem during shooting, but eventually decided that the closing shot was worth it as they believed not many people would notice the error.

==Release==
===Box office===
Walt Disney Pictures appeared to have high expectations for the film, being their widest-released film of the holiday season and the second-widest release under the Disney banner that year. However, the film opened in sixth place, initially reported to have collected $5.9 million in box office estimates, which was later revised to $5 million. Ultimately, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; grossed a total of $27.3 million in North America. Despite being a modest box office success, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; did not have a large effect during its theatrical release, having to face competition from &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; and Disney&#x27;s own &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens&#x27; tale to grace the screen, but &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; is funny and heartwarming, and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that there wasn&#x27;t &quot;great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there &quot;is&quot; a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.&quot; Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave it three and a half stars, calling it &quot;a delightfully imaginative musical adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; classic tale&quot; and noting that &quot;it&#x27;s a measure of Michael Caine&#x27;s talents as an actor that he&#x27;s able to give a straight-faced, remarkably convincing performance as the notorious tightwad Ebenezer Scrooge while surrounded by pint-sized veteran scene-stealers&quot;, though she did write that &quot;the songs by Paul Williams tend to sound exactly alike.&quot;

Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;die-hard Muppet fans may get a boost from the film but Dickens lovers will fare less well. Somewhere along the way—&#x27;round about the Ghost of Christmas Past stuff—the magic has fallen out of the story. The treacly score by Miles Goodman, with songs by Paul Williams, doesn&#x27;t help. The Muppets are at their best when they&#x27;re anarchic, without all this soggy whimsy.&quot; Norman Wilner of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, in contrast, called the film &quot;one of the most loyal renderings of Dickens&quot;, writing that &quot;Caine, who has always been able to fully become the characters he plays, delivers an unexpectedly strong performance as a human being who plays every scene with hand puppets [and] makes us believe he&#x27;s been relating to the little fuzzies all his life&quot;; however, he had a mixed review of Williams&#x27; songs in the film, and was particularly critical of its closing number.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, praised the technical achievements, but felt it &quot;could have done with a few more songs than it has, and the merrymaking at the end might have been carried on a little longer, just to offset the gloom of most of Scrooge&#x27;s tour through his lifetime spent spreading misery.&quot; On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, his partner &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Gene Siskel, who did not review the film in print, gave the film a Thumbs Down although he was favorable towards Michael Caine&#x27;s performance. Also from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Dave Kehr reviewed the film as &quot;a talky, plodding film that seems likely to bore children and adults in equal measure.&quot; Nevertheless, Kehr praised Val Strazovec&#x27;s production design and John Fenner&#x27;s cinematography believing its &quot;shadowy, naturalistic lighting creates a new look for a puppet film,&quot; but derided Paul Williams&#x27;s songs as unmemorable.

Likewise, &quot;Variety&quot; praised the production design and criticized Williams&#x27;s songs, writing &quot;Muppets Christmas Carol&quot; is &quot;not as enchanting or amusing as the previous entries in the Muppet series. But nothing can really diminish the late Jim Henson&#x27;s irresistibly appealing characters.&quot; Giving the film three stars out of five, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote the film is &quot;liberal but fun adaptation of a classic&quot; that &quot;turns out to be quite touching as Muppet movies go. Less pleasing are the forgettable songs that offer both clumsy word construction and dire music that eats away at the aesthetic quality of the movie. But you&#x27;ll be too busy looking out for the assorted Muppets to care much.&quot;

In London, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;&#x27;s Alexander Walker said that &quot;the Muppets pass their first screen test playing characters other than their felt or furry selves with great exuberance.&quot; Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was less welcoming, saying that &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s nightmare is rendered silly and so his turning from swine to saint hasn&#x27;t the required kick. Not only that, but the jokes are thin on the ground, as if only a certain amount of piss-taking was thought appropriate.&quot;

The film has grown in critical acclaim over the years, and was declared &quot;the greatest Christmas film ever made&quot; as well as &quot;among the most glorious of all Dickens adaptations&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2023. Anthony McGlynn of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; similarly called &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; &quot;a work of genius on every level&quot; and &quot;the greatest Christmas movie ever made&quot;, praising the original songs that were written for the film and Michael Caine&#x27;s performance as Scrooge. Robert Keeling of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised Caine&#x27;s performance, the adaptation&#x27;s use of Gonzo and Rizzo, as well as the various musical songs. It is often ranked among the best Christmas films.

===Home media===
This is the first &quot;Muppet&quot; film co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures—and the rights to the Muppets featured in the film would later be purchased by the studio&#x27;s parent company. In addition to theatrical releases, the film has also been made available on home video formats. It was first released on VHS in the US on November 5, 1993, in the UK on November 15, 1993, and later on DVD in both countries. The first US DVD release on October 8, 2002, was in a full-screen-only format. Walt Disney Home Entertainment released the film in the US on DVD on November 29, 2005, in conjunction with Kermit the Frog&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration; this time the DVD contained both full-screen and widescreen presentations. The UK has also had similar DVD releases.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released a 20th anniversary collector&#x27;s edition on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy on November 6, 2012. The release does not include the film&#x27;s extended cut. However, the song &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot; and its accompanying scene can be viewed in its entirety on the full-screen version of the anniversary edition of &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;, though it is cut in the widescreen format.

On December 9, 2022, Disney+ released a 30th anniversary edition via streaming media which includes the song &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot; as an option in its menu.

A story album of the movie was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 1994.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s original score was composed by Miles Goodman with songs written by Paul Williams. Williams previously worked with the Muppets on the soundtrack to &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979) in which he and Kenneth Ascher were nominated for an Academy Award for writing &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;. Goodman previously scored several films that were directed by Muppet performer Frank Oz.

===Soundtrack===

&quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; contains all of the songs from the film, which were written by Paul Williams, as well as several cues from the score by Miles Goodman. However, most of them are different arrangements than as they are featured in the film. The performances are by the Muppet characters as well as Caine, and the album also includes the songs &quot;Room in Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot; that were recorded but never filmed. As with all preceding Muppet films, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; was shot as a musical. The soundtrack album peaked at number 189 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The soundtrack was re-released on digital by Walt Disney Records on November 6, 2012.

====Track listing====
===&quot;When Love Is Gone&quot;===
&quot;When Love Is Gone&quot; is a song sung by the character Belle (portrayed by Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooge&#x27;s love of money has replaced his love of her. The song itself was cut from the original 1992 American theatrical edition of the film by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the then-chairman of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the song would not appeal to young viewers. Instead, the song was played during the film&#x27;s end credits scene. Brian Henson objected to this decision as the concluding song, &quot;When Love Is Found&quot;, was a direct counterpoint to it.

Henson commented: When Love Is Gone&#x27; was not in the theatrical release, and is presently missing from some copies of the movie, which is a real shame.&quot; The song titled &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot; is only included on some home media releases of &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; which are now out of print. The song is included on all of the 1993 VHS and LaserDisc releases of the film, as well as at least one UK VHS release. The LaserDisc version includes the only widescreen presentation of this song ever released.

The 2002 and 2005 DVD releases of the movie retain the song in the 90-minute full-screen version of the film, but not in the 86-minute widescreen version on the same disc. A 2012 standalone DVD release of the film uses the same disc from the 2005 release, so it also contains the song. However, a different DVD was used for the 2012 Blu-ray combo pack which does not contain the song. The digital download release of the film contains the entire &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot; as a bonus feature, in widescreen and in high definition.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, Henson said he believed that the song was &quot;unlikely&quot; to appear in any further releases of the film, because Disney had reportedly lost the original video master and film negative. In 2019, Robert Keeling of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; felt it an &quot;excellent choice&quot; for the song to be omitted, feeling it to be &quot;thoroughly depressing and out of place&quot;. However, on December 9, 2020, Henson confirmed to BBC Radio 2 that the original film negative featuring the entire footage of the song had been found by Disney archivists and would be included in all future 4K releases. Due to time constraints, Disney+ was unable to include the new full version on its Christmas 2020 streaming release of the film. At the 2022 D23 Expo in September, Henson stated the version of the film with the song restored would be available on Disney+ later that year. The streaming service released the full-length version as an option in the film&#x27;s &quot;extras&quot; section on December 9, 2022.

<doc id="1131833" wikidata="Q276176" url="?curid=1131833" title="Volta Redonda">
<text>Volta Redonda () is a municipality in the Rio de Janeiro state of Brazil with an area of 182.81 km2, located from 350m to 707m above the sea level (22°31&#x27;23&quot; S, 44°06&#x27;15&quot; W) and with a population of 273,988 inhabitants (estimated in 2020). The area around the city has nearly 700,000 km2. Its name (which is Portuguese for &quot;Round Turn&quot;) is due to the round shape of a curve in the Paraíba do Sul river around which the city was built.

Situated in Volta Redonda is Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN), Brazil&#x27;s second largest steel producer. Today its economy, despite still being based on industry, is quite diverse, and largely focused on the areas of services and trade. Due to this, Volta Redonda is worldly known as &quot;Cidade do Aço&quot; (which is Portuguese for &quot;Steel City&quot;).

The city borders with the municipalities of Barra Mansa (north, northwest, west and southwest), Barra do Piraí (northeast), Pinheiral, Piraí (south and east), and Rio Claro (south) and is 130 km from the city of Rio de Janeiro.

Along with the municipalities of Barra Mansa and Pinheiral, it is a conurbation of over 500,000 inhabitants, according to the IBGE estimates for 2008, and the state&#x27;s largest urban spot outside the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro.

Economical center of the South Fluminense region, Volta Redonda is a strategic area, close to major hub cities in other regional states, such as Juiz de Fora (190 kilometers) and Sao Jose dos Campos (220 kilometers).

==History==
In 1744, the first explorers named the curious curve of the Paraíba do Sul river &quot;Volta Redonda&quot;. Big farms were installed in the region and nowadays some farm names are the names of some districts.

Between the years of 1860 and 1870, the navigation through the Paraíba do Sul river had its golden period between the cities of Resende and Barra do Piraí and at the same time the railroad D. Pedro II was built in Barra do Piraí and Barra Mansa.

With this, in 1875, the village of Santo Antonio de Volta Redonda started to have great impulse, but with the freedom of slaves in 1888, the decay of the Vale do Paraíba became visible, destroying the agriculture, which would never recover in a very satisfactory way.

This situation would be reversed in 1941, when the cycle of industrialization of Volta Redonda began. Chosen as site for installing the Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) steel mill in the middle of World War II, it marked the base of Brazilian industrialization. Laborers from diverse regions of the country came to Volta Redonda to work in the mill. When it opened in 1946, it was the first steel mill in South America.

A heavily subsidized symbol of national pride, the Volta Redonda mill embodied the import substitution industrial policies that prevailed in Latin American economies from World War II until the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s. Since its 1993 privatization, however, the mill — now known as the Presidente Vargas Steelworks — has transcended its &quot;dirigiste&quot; origins to become one of the world&#x27;s most efficient steel production facilities - due to this large production of steel and minerals, the city is globally nicknamed &quot;Cidade do Aço&quot; (literal Portuguese for &quot;City of Steel&quot;).

== Politics and government ==
Volta Redonda&#x27;s mayor () is currently Antônio Francisco Neto of the Progressistas party, elected in 2020 to serve a four-year term. The 21-member council () was elected at the same time.

==Education==
In the second half of the 20th century, the city received the boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1961 the Industrial Engineering and Metallurgical Volta Redonda of Fluminense Federal University who later brought more courses the city with the Institute of Exact Sciences and Institute Humanities and Social Sciences, or also higher education institutions University Center or Geraldo Di Biase - UGB, University Centre of Barra Mansa - UBM and University Center of Volta Redonda - UniFOA was created. In the 2000s, the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro was launched with technological and industrial emphasis.

==Sports==
Volta Redonda Futebol Clube is the most important football club of the city, playing its home matches at Estádio Raulino de Oliveira, which is also located in the city downtown.

<doc id="1131834" wikidata="Q1956127" url="?curid=1131834" title="Mutus (crater)">
<text>Mutus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southern part of the Moon. It lies to the north-northeast of the larger crater Manzinus, and some distance to the south of Hommel. It is 78 kilometers in diameter and 3.7 kilometers deep. It is from the Pre-Nectarian period, 4.55 to 3.92 billion years ago.

The outer rim of Mutus is worn and eroded, with a pair of small but notable craters, Mutus A and Mutus V, lying across the eastern rim. A number of other tiny craters lay along the rim and the interior wall. Another crater, Mutus B, is located on the crater floor, just to the south of the midpoint. The remainder of the interior is relatively flat, and punctuated by several tiny craterlets to the north of Mutus B.

Mutus is named for Vincente Mut (Muth), a 17th-century Spanish astronomer and sailor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mutus.

<doc id="1131835" wikidata="Q2466845" url="?curid=1131835" title="UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies">
<text>The UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES ) is a school of University College London (UCL) specializing in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Russia and Eurasia. It teaches a range of subjects, including the history, politics, literature, sociology, economics and languages of the region. It is Britain&#x27;s largest centre for study of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and Russia. It has links with universities across Europe and beyond. It became part of UCL in 1999.

==History==
The school was founded by Robert Seton-Watson in 1915, as a department of King&#x27;s College London, and inaugurated by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, later President of Czechoslovakia. In 1932 it became an independent institute of the University of London, but it merged with University College London in 1999.

==Teaching==
More than 100 staff teach and conduct research in the history, economics, politics, sociology, anthropology, culture, literature and languages of the countries of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2012/2013 the school had over 200 graduate students studying taught MA degrees or undertaking PhD research. The school also has over 600 undergraduate students.

==Research==
Along with its undergraduate and graduate teaching, the school hosts several interdisciplinary research centres, groups and funded projects aimed at helping to expand research and understanding of its specialist regions.

It analyses and disseminates information about changes in the region, publishing periodicals, papers and books, holding conferences, public lectures, seminars and briefings, and providing experts to act as advisers to governments, the media and institutions.

==Library==
SSEES&#x27;s first library was housed in King&#x27;s College and staffed by a part time honorary librarian. In 1928 after the school moved to premises in Torrington Square books were housed by subject in various lecturers&#x27;s rooms. The first full time librarian Sergei Yacobson was appointed in 1934 and he compiled the first catalogue of the library&#x27;s stock. The library along with the school moved to new premises in Senate House in 1938 but during the war the library had to be left behind when SSEES was evacuated to Oxford and many books were damaged during an air raid. In the post war years the library expanded both in space occupied and staff employed.

The library of some 357,000 volumes of books, pamphlets and periodicals is unique in the United Kingdom for the quantity of research material on open access and the extensive collection of regional newspapers. Its collections are consulted by scholars from all over the world. It has recently taken on a major role in providing electronic and audio-visual material on its area of study. The library moved from Senate House to a new building in Taviton Street in 2005.

The main fields of interest are the languages, literature, history, politics, economics, geography and bibliography of the countries it covers. Subsidiary fields are the arts in general, demography, ethnography and religion. Material is also collected on the former German Democratic Republic (history, political and economic life), the history of Germany and Austria, the Lusatian Sorbs, and Slavonic and Ugro-Finnic studies in general. It houses the Bain Graffy Film Collection of films from and about Russia and Central and Eastern Europe.

==Building==
In May 2004 the foundation stone of the school&#x27;s new building on Taviton Street, Bloomsbury, was unveiled by the President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, in the presence of The Princess Royal, Chancellor of the University of London. The school moved to the building in the summer of 2005 after almost 90 years at Senate House. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, delivered the keynote address of his visit to the UK at a ceremony to open the building in October 2005. After Klaus&#x27;s address, the Princess Royal unveiled a stone to mark the formal opening, on the occasion of the school&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

The building was designed by the architects Short and Associates. The design aims to be &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; not simply with solar panels, but by facilitating the draught of cool air round the building, to avoid a need for air conditioning or other energy-using solutions – a first for the &quot;central London heat island&quot;.

<doc id="1131836" wikidata="Q4683472" url="?curid=1131836" title="Administrative License Suspension">
<text>License suspension or revocation traditionally follows conviction for alcohol-impaired or drunk driving. However, under administrative license suspension (ALS) laws, sometimes called administrative license revocation or administrative per se, licenses are confiscated and automatically suspended independent of criminal proceedings whenever a driver either (1) refuses to submit to chemical testing (blood, breath or, in some states, urine), or (2) submits to testing with results indicating a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher. 

Because ALS laws are immediate and require no proof of guilt, proponents such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving argue that they are more effective in reducing drunk driving than are traditional post-conviction sanctions, and that, in any event, driving is only a privilege. However, civil liberties advocates and other critics object to a procedure in which guilt is presumed and punishment is automatically imposed by the officer; they further point out that state and federal courts have held the driving privilege, once given, to be a vested right that cannot be taken away without due process. See, e.g., &quot;Schuman v. California&quot;, 584 F.2d 868 (1978). 

The laws have also been criticized as constituting double jeopardy and/or multiple punishment. While the argument for double jeopardy is tenuous, that for multiple punishment may have merit: the driver has his license suspended by the State in the ALS proceedings, and then is punished by the State again in court for the same offense—the punishment often involving a second license suspension. While this issue has been resolved both ways in the past by state and federal courts, the currently prevailing view is that there is no multiple punishment since the suspension is only an administrative &quot;sanction&quot;, not a criminal &quot;punishment&quot;.

As of 2010, only nine states did not have ALS laws: Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Tennessee.

==The example of Texas==
In the state of Texas, Administrative License Revocation is a process by which an individual who is arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) has his or her driver&#x27;s license administratively suspended. This program went into effect on January 1, 1995, and is administrated by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS records indicate that 103,168 notices of suspension were served during the calendar year 2003. During that period, the agency processed 95,495 suspensions.

A suspension can occur from either the refusal to submit to a chemical test or results of 0.08 or greater alcohol concentration when a chemical test is taken. This blood alcohol concentration (0.08 grams percent) applies to drivers aged 21 and over, but a lower BAC level applies to underage drivers or any driver operating a commercial motor vehicle. DPS is also authorized to suspend the drivers licenses of minors who commit the offense of driving under the influence (DUI) as well as individuals who refuse to provide a specimen following an arrest for the offense of boating while intoxicated (BWI). The statutes concerning ALS are found in the Texas Transportation Code at Chapters 524 and 724. 

The administrative license suspension process usually begins when a law enforcement officer determines that there is reasonable suspicion for an initial traffic stop of a motorist. If the officer has reason to believe that the driver is impaired, field sobriety tests are administered. If the driver performs poorly, the driver is arrested for DWI and transported to the police station. At the station, the officer will read to the driver the &quot;Statutory Warning&quot; and then request that driver submit to a breath or blood test to measure his/her alcohol concentration. If the driver refuses to provide a specimen or provides a specimen with a prohibited alcohol concentration, the officer serves a notice of suspension and confiscates the driver&#x27;s license. 

Procedures for handling minors vary slightly. A law enforcement officer must have reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop, however, a full custodial arrest is not required. Once the officer determines that the individual is under 21 years of age and has reason to believe that he/she has consumed alcohol, the officer will issue the driver a citation for DUI, serve the notice of suspension, and confiscate the driver license. The minor may or may not be placed under arrest and a chemical test may or may not be requested. The officer may proceed with a custodial arrest procedure if he believes the individual is seriously impaired.

The driver has fifteen days from the date of the notice of suspension is served to request a hearing. If no hearing is requested, the suspension will automatically go into effect on the 40th day after notice was served.

The period of suspension is 90 days to a year, depending upon the existence of prior convictions; if a refusal to submit to testing is involved, the periods are 180 days to two years. Minors face suspensions of 60 to 180 days. 

=== Technological Advancements ===
Notable developments observed in Texas with the introduction of digital reporting systems and automated data exchanges between departments has facilitated a more streamlined enforcement process. These systems allow for faster updates and reduced errors in the management of license statuses minimizing administrative delays.

==Administrative suspension hearing==
Assuming the license holder makes the demand for a hearing within the statutory period, a hearing is scheduled. The nature of these vary considerably from state to state. In some states, the hearing takes place in court before a judge. More commonly, however, an administrative hearing will be conducted by the state&#x27;s Department of Motor Vehicles. The procedures for these administrative hearings vary as well. In some, the hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), the state&#x27;s case will be presented by a prosecutor, and the officer will be required to testify. In a growing number of others, such as California, the role of &quot;judge&quot; and &quot;prosecutor&quot; are filled by one person—a DMV employee with no legal training—and the DMV&#x27;s case can consist of no more than the arrest report; if the licensee wishes to cross-examine the officer, he must subpoena him and pay for his salary.

<doc id="1131843" wikidata="Q988118" url="?curid=1131843" title="Issachar Jacox Roberts">
<text>Issachar Jacox Roberts (Chinese: 罗孝全 &quot;Luó Xiàoquán&quot;; 1802–1871) was a Southern Baptist missionary in Qing China notable for being in direct contact with Hong Xiuquan and for denying him Christian baptism.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, and graduated from Furman University, a Baptist school in Greenville, South Carolina.

==Significance==
He was known for his erratic behaviour and &quot;falling into difficulties with nearly everyone who worked with him&quot;, which cost him his connection with the Southern Baptist Convention. Roberts was the only Baptist known to have influenced Hong Xiuquan (洪秀全, Wade-Giles: Hung Hsiu-ch&#x27;üan), the Hakka who led the Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864) against the Qing Dynasty which caused millions of deaths. Hong spent two months studying with Roberts at Canton (Guangzhou) in 1847. Roberts refused Hong&#x27;s request for baptism, perhaps due to a misunderstanding.

He was also the first Baptist missionary, arriving in Hong Kong in February 1842.

==With the Taiping==
In 1860, Roberts left Canton for the Taiping capital at Nanjing. He was dismayed to find that the beliefs of the Taiping departed widely from his own Christianity, but nevertheless accepted a post as advisor to Hong Rengan, foreign minister at the Taiping court. While there, Roberts arranged for some Baptists from the United States to visit Nanjing and meet Hong directly. He left in January 1862, on board the British gunboat &quot;Renard&quot;, following a dispute with Hong, accusing Hong of the murder of Issachar&#x27;s servant, and was thereafter fiercely critical of the Taiping.

==Death==
Roberts died of leprosy (which he had contracted in Macao in 1837) at the home of his niece in Upper Alton, Madison County, Illinois on December 28, 1871.

<doc id="1131851" wikidata="Q478057" url="?curid=1131851" title="Raymond V, Count of Toulouse">
<text>Raymond V (; c. 1134 – c. 1194) was Count of Toulouse from 1148 until his death in 1194.

He was the son of Alphonse I of Toulouse and Faydida of Provence. Alphonse took his son with him on the Second Crusade in 1147. When Alphonse died in Caesarea in 1148, the county of Toulouse passed to his son Raymond, then aged 14. Raymond co-ruled with his brother Alfonso II. The young count was honoured by Rorgo Fretellus, archdeacon of Nazareth, who dedicated a new edition of his &quot;Description of the Holy Places&quot; to him.

As count, Raymond permitted the first assembly of townsmen in Toulouse, the origin of the later capitouls.

In 1165, in the town of Lombers, the bishop of Albi, attended by both clerics and members of the nobility, including Constance, the wife of Raymond V, interrogated and debated with members of an alleged heretical sect. Calling themselves &quot;Good Men&quot;, this group held beliefs similar to those of Henry of Lausanne and Peter of Bruys as well as indicating Cathar influence. While the Good Men declined to respond to a number of questions about their beliefs, they told the bishop that they did not accept the Old Testament, and that their reading of the New Testament persuaded them that they should not take oaths. They further challenged the jurisdiction of the bishop.

In 1178 Raymond requested assistance from the Cistercians to combat heresy in his dominions. Wakefield suggests that being under pressure on his western border from King Alfonso II of Aragon, Raymond wished to present himself as a defender of the faith. A joint legatine and royal commission arrived in Toulouse charged with authority to preach, investigate, and condemn. It operated for three months.

==Family==
In 1153/6, Raymond married Constance, daughter of King Louis VI of France by his second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. Constance was the childless widow of Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne, elder son of Stephen, King of England. Because the couple were related within prohibited degrees, they were able to obtain a separation by ecclesiastical authority in 1165. By this time, they already had five children, including:
#Raymond VI, who succeeded his father as Count of Toulouse

==History==

John Tarleton College was founded in 1887 with an endowment from settler John Tarleton. John Tarleton died on September 11, 1895, and left part of his estate—mostly property—to be sold to “erect, endow and maintain” The John Tarleton College. Texas Governor Charles Allen Culberson, State Superintendent of Public Instruction James McCoy Carlisle and Erath County Judge Thomas B. King were named as trustees. On March 12, 1896, they appointed McIlhany principal, instructed him to open the college on September 7, 1899, and pay himself from tuition because the Tarleton estate lacked sufficient cash on hand. On July 3, 1897, trustees unanimously “continued” McIlhany “as President of College on same terms as year 1896–1897.” On January 11, 1898, to assist in local management of the college, trustees established a board of directors in Stephenville that re-elected McIlhany in February 1898, but trustees declined to ratify that action. On March 22, 1898, trustees Culberson and Carlisle elected William Herschel Bruce as second president of The John Tarleton College, and McIlhany left Stephenville that summer. From 1898 to 1903 he served as the first president of Goodnight College, near Goodnight, Texas. In 1917, U.S. Senator and Stephenville resident Henry Clark co-authored and presented legislation establishing John Tarleton Agricultural College as a member of the Texas A&amp;M University system, certifying the Junior College within the Educational System of Texas. In 1949, it was again renamed Tarleton State College then became a four-year degree-granting institution in 1959. Tarleton gained status as a university in 1973 adopting its current name, Tarleton State University. In 2003 it began offering doctoral programs.

== Academics ==

The university offers 85 undergraduate, 38 masters, 2 associate degree programs, and 2 doctoral programs.

Degrees are offered through eight colleges:

The Department of Animal Sciences oversees the Tarleton Equine-Assisted Therapy (TREAT) program that is designed to utilize horseback riding as a form of physical, emotional and recreational therapy. Hippotherapy (physical therapy on horseback using the horse as a therapist) has developed as a medical field recognized by most major countries.

The Texas Institute for Applied Environmental Research (TIAER) on the Tarleton campus plays a national leadership role in environmental issues related to water quality. This program provides the university, the dairy and beef industries, environmental control agencies and governmental policy groups with water pollution data for the Upper North Bosque River watershed.

In fall 2002 the W.K. Gordon Center for Industrial History of Texas opened at a site located near Thurber, a ghost town located approximately northwest of Stephenville and about one hour west of the DFW Metroplex. Funded through a $1.2 million grant from the Texas Department of Transportation and a private gift from Mrs. W.K. Gordon Jr. The center is located on near the site of Texas&#x27; first coal mine and adjacent to New York Hill along Interstate 20. The center is dedicated to the preservation, research and recording of Texas industrial history including coal mining, brick making and oil and gas exploration.

Tarleton operates two radio stations. KXTR-LP 100.7 FM is a student-operated rock station, while KTRL 90.5 FM is a public radio station broadcasting news, classical music, and jazz. Both are operated by students of Tarleton State University out of the radio station located in the Mathematics building on the TSU campus. Tarleton State University is one of three universities in the state of Texas to own and operate two radio stations; the other institutions being the University of Texas at Austin and Texas Tech University.

== Student life ==

===Athletics===

Tarleton State University athletics currently competes at the NCAA Division I level in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). They were admitted into the WAC on July 1, 2020, therefore ending their 26-year stint at the Division II level with the Lone Star Conference (LSC). Their admission into the LSC in 1995 marked their second period of membership, having previously participated from 1968 to 1975. They were a founding member of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA) in 1976 and remained in that league until 1990. From 1991 to 1994 Tarleton played as an Independent.

The teams are known as the &quot;Texans&quot;. Athletes were known as the &quot;Plowboys&quot; before the college became a four-year institution in 1961.

When women&#x27;s sports were introduced in 1968–69, those teams played under the &quot;Texans&quot; nickname, but due to the desire of that day&#x27;s female athletes to play under a distinctive nickname, the women&#x27;s nickname was changed the next school year. &quot;Texanns&quot;, &quot;Tex-Anns&quot;, and &quot;TexAnns&quot; were used interchangeably until 1972–73, when &quot;TexAnns&quot; was officially settled on. Following a campaign initially led by two players and a (female) student manager in the women&#x27;s basketball program, Tarleton returned the &quot;Texans&quot; nickname to women&#x27;s teams in 2019–20.

The basketball and volleyball teams play at Wisdom Gym. The football team plays at Memorial Stadium. The baseball team plays at Cecil Ballow Baseball Complex. The softball team plays at the Tarleton Softball Complex.

Tarleton State University fields six men&#x27;s varsity sports and eight women&#x27;s varsity sports in the Western Athletic Conference:


===Music===

This multi-purpose fine arts complex contains three theatres: a 243-seat recital hall, an 805-seat auditorium, and the workshop theatre. There is a 16-keyboard piano lab and computer lab. The instrument collection includes two nine-foot concert Steinway grand pianos, the Waggener Memorial Organ (a tracker two-manual pipe organ), a Richard Kingston harpsichord, and several Steinway grand pianos that are designated for piano majors to practice. The university currently offers three music degrees, which are Bachelor of Arts in music, Bachelor of Music in music education (with all-level certification) and the Bachelor of Music in performance. It currently offers one online graduate degree, Master of Music in music education. The program has over 150 full-time enrolled students with 80% being instrumental studies and 20% being vocal studies. The Tarleton music department hosts many festivals and clinics throughout the school year, including Brass Day, TMEA All-Region Band clinics, Jazz Festival, Invitational Band Festival, TMEA Area Choir clinics, and the Let All Men Sing!

Music ensembles include The Sound and the Fury, The Texan Marching Band, Foul Play Basketball Band, Chamber Winds, Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, two jazz bands, Brass Ensemble, Woodwind Chamber Ensemble, Trumpet Ensemble, Horn Choir, and Flute Choir.

===Texan Corps of Cadets===
The Texan Corps of Cadets was founded in 1917 when John Tarleton Agriculture College joined the Texas A&amp;M University system. The Corps of Cadets was initially known as &quot;Johns Army&quot;. The Corps of Cadets survived through the end of the 1950s. Until 2016, the school had only an Army ROTC program. However, in 2016 the Texan Corps of Cadets was brought back to the university.

The Texan Corps of Cadets offers students an opportunity to obtain a minor in Leadership Studies. All cadets live together in a residence hall at Tarleton called Traditions. All cadets wear their uniforms to class every day and must abide by the regulations set forth in the &quot;Chisel&quot;.

===Traditions===

====Oscar P.====
Oscar P. was, according to legend, John Tarleton&#x27;s pet duck who went everywhere with him. The two were so close that the duck is supposedly buried with Tarleton. During athletic events, students chant to raise the spirit of Oscar P.

====Purple Poo====
TTP – Ten Tarleton Peppers (1921) and TTS – Ten Tarleton Sisters (1923) are the two oldest spirit organizations on campus and are precursors of the Purple Poo, a secret organization which promotes school spirit. The members in this organization keep their identities secret by appearing in public in costume. The organization gathers to make &quot;Poo Say&quot; signs each Monday night. The &quot;Poo Say&quot; signs appear nailed to trees on campus every Tuesday morning and occasionally comment on campus political life and student life.

====The Plowboys====
The Plowboys, originally the mascot for Tarleton athletic teams, but more recently known as a spirit organization, wear purple and white shirts, cowboy hats, and purple chaps. Founded in 1984, they organize the Bonfire every year.

====Texan Rider====
Texan Rider is Tarleton&#x27;s current mascot that at one time rode a horse during the football games (this tradition was discontinued due to the renovated stadium), and wears purple chaps. The Texan Rider has been the mascot of Tarleton since 1961 when the student body chose the Texans and TexAnns to represent its athletic teams.

====Silver Taps====
Silver Taps, a ceremony held to honor Tarleton&#x27;s faculty, staff, students, and alumni who have died over the past year, is held in the spring during Founder&#x27;s Week.

====Homecoming====
During the 1980s, the Student Government Association added the Yell Contest to Homecoming Week. Student organizations perform step and dance moves to original chants and lyrics; a panel of judges selects the top two teams. The winning team has the honor of beating the drum immediately following the Plowboys.

====Special awards====

=====John Tarleton Spirit Award=====
The John Tarleton Spirit Award originated in 1988, and is given to up to 12 students annually at the Leadership and Service Awards Banquet. Recipients are chosen based on campus involvement through organizations, special projects, and activities that contribute to the overall growth of the individual.

<doc id="1131859" wikidata="Q1242316" url="?curid=1131859" title="Pontécoulant (crater)">
<text>Pontécoulant is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the southeastern part of the Moon. Due to its position, the crater appears foreshortened from the Earth and it is difficult to observe much detail. Nearby craters include Hanno just to the northeast, and the comparably sized Helmholtz due south.

This crater has d inner wall that is nearly circular, but with an outward extension to the southeast. The rim is somewhat worn but retains much detail. The crater partly overlies the older and smaller Pontécoulant E along the southern rim, and has several tiny craterlets on the eastern inner wall and one to the southwest.

The inner floor is nearly flat, with some rough ground near the southern rim and some low central peaks located southwest of the midpoint. There is a small but prominent crater located at the center of the floor, and several other tiny craters scattered across the inner surface.

Pontécoulant is a crater of Nectarian age.

The eponym of this crater is Philippe Gustave Doulcet, &quot;le Comte de Pontécoulant&quot;, and the name was approved by the IAU in 1935.

On 19 August 2023 the Russian Luna 25 lander crashed on the inner rim of the Pontécoulant G satellite crater, following a technical issue that prevented it from performing a soft landing in the target destination close to the Lunar south pole.

On September 3, 2023 the impact site of the Luna 25 lander has been described as a pock. An official title to this impact site has not yet been assigned by the International Astronomical Union.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pontécoulant.

<doc id="1131868" wikidata="Q917335" url="?curid=1131868" title="Pinhel">
<text>Pinhel () is a municipality, former Catholic bishopric and present Latin titular see in the central subregion of Beira Interior Norte, in Portugal. The municipality population in 2011 was 9,627, in an area of 484.52 km2. The urban centre of Pinhel had about 3500 residents in 2001.

== History ==
The origins of this municipality date back to the Calcolithic period, as many of the remnants of ancient cultures from this period remain: namely the rock-art engravings and paintings that line the Côa valley in Cidadelhe. Part of the historic district of Guarda, the region obtained its name for many pine forests that covered the region&#x27;s hills and mountains.

There are also several references to a pre-Roman or Roman presence, suggesting a continual occupancy since this period.

During the medieval period, owing to the defensive requirements of the fledgling nation, several fortified centres developed, including the Pinhel, but also along a line that included: Trancoso, Marialva, Guarda, Castelo Rodrigo, Almeida and Castelo Mendo. The Castle of Pinhel dates from the reign of King Denis and the keep tower from his descendant, King Manuel I. Pinhel&#x27;s strategic position, along the frontier with Spain, made the monarchs of Portugal retain many of these fortifications, as well as allowing the development of their territorial claims.

The historical centre, with its narrow roadways, were adapted from the morphology of the terrain, with many patrimonial references to the medieval and modern eras. The homes of the city of Pinhel, some dating from the 16th century, includes some lost references to the presence of a Jewish population at one time, such as along the &quot;Rua de Santa Maria&quot;. Pinhel was, for a long time, the seat of its own diocese, before being incorporated into the Diocese of Guarda.

The 17th and 18th century were periods of growth for the region, dominated the construction of estates, scattered in many of the historic corners of the municipality, some monumental and decorative.

The urbanized area of Pinhel, the city of Pinhel, was elevated to this status in 1770.

== Ecclesiastical History ==
In 1770.08.25 a bishopric was established as Diocese of Pinhel / Pinhelen(sis) (Latin adjective), on territory split off from the Diocese of Lamego, apparently as suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Braga.
The Church of the Saviour (Portuguese: Igreja do Salvador) served as cathedral, until its demolition and substitution as such in 1797 by the convent church of St. Louis (Portuguese: Igreja de São Luís) as ordered by bishop Don Bernardo Bernardino Beltrão Freire.

It was suppressed on 1881.09.30, its territory being merged into the Diocese of Guarda.

<text>William Sharp Bush (c. 1786 - 1812) was an officer in the United States Marine Corps during the War of 1812. He was also the first Marine Corps officer to be killed in combat.

Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Bush was appointed as a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 3 July 1809 and was promoted to First Lieutenant on 4 March 1811. He lost his life while serving aboard , when he fell mortally wounded while attempting to board the frigate on 19 August 1812.

He was posthumously awarded a silver medal by the United States Congress. His silver medal was presented to his nearest male relative, Lewis Bush Jackson, in early 1835.

==Namesake==
Two destroyers in the U.S. Navy have been named after Bush. The first was a that served from 1919 to 1922 and was scrapped in 1936. The second was a that served during World War II from 1943 to 1945. She was sunk in April 1945 off of Okinawa after being struck by three Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft during the naval invasion of Okinawa.

<doc id="1131875" wikidata="Q1455257" url="?curid=1131875" title="French Hill (settlement)">
<text>French Hill (, &quot;HaGiv&#x27;a HaTzarfatit&quot;, , &quot;at-tel al-faransiya&quot;), also Giv&#x27;at Shapira (), is an Israeli settlement in northern East Jerusalem. It is located on territory that has been occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967 and later unilaterally annexed by Israel under the Jerusalem Law, in a move internationally condemned as illegal, &quot;null and void&quot; under international law, in 1980. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, such as French Hill, illegal under international law, which the Israeli government disputes.

==Etymology==
The source of the name French Hill is the fact that the land belonged to the Catholic Monastery of St Anne, whose monks hailed mainly from France. In 1926 the Monastery donated a plot of land to build a reservoir to store water that was pumped from Ein Farah, to supply the city of Jerusalem. An opening ceremony was held on 15 July 1926 and the location was reported in the newspapers as &quot;the French Hill&quot; (at the time in Hebrew in plural - Giv&#x27;at Ha&#x27;Zorfatim).

According to local legend, it was named after a British general, John French, 1st Earl of Ypres who is said to have had his headquarters on this hill. According to this legend there was a mistake with the translation to Hebrew that named the place after the country France (in Hebrew: Tzarfat). However, French never served in this region. Had the neighborhood been named for General French, the correct name in Hebrew would have been &quot;Giv&#x27;at French&quot;.

==History==
Under Jordanian rule, the area () was a military outpost. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, a small number of Palestinians from Lifta moved to the area prior to 1967.

According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from the following Palestinian neighbourhoods/villages in order to construct French Hill in 1968:
*394 dunams from Isawiya,
*394 dunams from Shuafat.

In 1969, construction began on a new residential neighborhood to create a land link between West Jerusalem and the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus, which had been an Israeli enclave in Jordanian territory before the war. The official name of the new neighborhood was &quot;Giv&#x27;at Shapira&quot;.

Then prime minister Levi Eshkol envisioned French Hill as the &quot;first planned urban community in modern Jerusalem.&quot; In 2014, it was described as a clean, quiet neighborhood with bicycle trails, parks, fitness centers, a community center and many synagogues.

Another section of French Hill, Tzameret HaBira, was populated by American immigrants.

French Hill junction is one of the busiest junctions in Jerusalem, with tens of thousands of vehicles passing through it daily. As part of the French Hill tunnels project being implemented by the Jerusalem Municipality and the Ministry of Transportation, four tunnels are being built to ease the traffic congestion for residents travelling into the city.

==Demographics==
In 2002–2003, French Hill had a population of 6,631. Giv&#x27;at Shapira had a population density of 10.9 persons per dunam (10,900 people/km2), while Tzameret HaBira was less crowded, with 4.7 persons per dunam (4,700 people/km2). The population is mostly Jewish, including a large number of immigrants from South America and the former Soviet Union. In recent years, an increasing number of Arabs have been buying apartments in the neighborhood. The neighborhood has also seen a large influx of Orthodox Jews. The ethnic mix is much more diverse than in most other Jewish areas in the city, partly due to the proximity of the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus.

==Schools and religious institutions==
French Hill has 9 synagogues. One of them, Kehillat Ramot Zion (), is a Masorti congregation. The first elementary school in Israel run by the movement, the Frankel School, was established in Givat Shapira (French Hill).

==Economy==
The Dan Jerusalem Hotel, originally the Hyatt Regency, has 502 guestrooms and suites, making it Jerusalem&#x27;s largest hotel. The terraced structure was designed by Israel Prize-winning architect David Reznik.

==Arab-Israeli conflict==

The French Hill intersection which connects northern Jerusalem to Maale Adumim and the Dead Sea has been the site of eleven Palestinian terror attacks.

According to an article by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;the busy thoroughfare, which divides the Jewish neighborhood of French Hill from the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat, is the most accessible corner in the city for a West Bank terrorist looking for a crowd of Israelis.&quot;

In 2004, members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigade shot and killed George Khoury, an Israeli Arab economics student, while he was jogging in French Hill, having mistaken him for a Jew.

==Archaeology==
A 2,700 year old citadel with an open courtyard and rooms on both sides was discovered at the end of the 1960s on a hilltop on French Hill. Archaeologists believe it was part of a series of citadels built to guard Jerusalem during the First Temple Period. A salvage dig in 1970-1971 unearthed late Hellenistic and Herodian tombs. One of the 13 ossuaries discovered was inscribed with the name &quot;Yehosef (Joseph) ben Haggai.&quot;

<doc id="1131883" wikidata="Q836684" url="?curid=1131883" title="McCartney (album)">
<text>McCartney is the debut solo studio album by the English rock musician Paul McCartney, released on 17 April 1970 by Apple Records. McCartney recorded it in secrecy, mostly using basic home-recording equipment at his house in St John&#x27;s Wood. Mixing and some recording took place at professional London studios. In its loosely arranged performances, &quot;McCartney&quot; eschewed the polish of the Beatles&#x27; past records in favour of a lo-fi style. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, Linda, McCartney performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape.

McCartney recorded the album during a period of depression and confusion, following John Lennon&#x27;s private departure from the Beatles in September 1969. Conflicts over the release of McCartney&#x27;s album further estranged him from his bandmates, as he refused to delay the album&#x27;s release to allow for Apple&#x27;s previously scheduled titles, notably the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. A press release in the form of a self-interview supplied with UK promotional copies of &quot;McCartney&quot; led to the Beatles&#x27; break-up.

&quot;McCartney&quot; received mostly negative reviews, while McCartney himself was vilified for seemingly ending the Beatles. The record was widely criticised for being under-produced and for its unfinished songs, although the ballad &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; was consistently singled out for praise. Commercially, &quot;McCartney&quot; benefited from the publicity surrounding the break-up; it held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs before yielding that position to &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It peaked at number 2 in Britain.

In later years, the album was credited for influencing DIY musicians and lo-fi music styles. McCartney also recorded two successor albums: &quot;McCartney II&quot; (1980) and &quot;McCartney III&quot; (2020). In 2011, the first &quot;McCartney&quot; record was reissued with bonus tracks as part of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;.
==Background==

After John Lennon requested a &quot;divorce&quot; from the Beatles in a band meeting on 20 September 1969, Paul McCartney withdrew to his farm in Campbeltown, Scotland. Author Robert Rodriguez describes his frame of mind as &quot;brokenhearted, shocked, and dispirited at the loss of the only job he had ever known&quot;. While Lennon&#x27;s departure was not made official, partly for business reasons, McCartney&#x27;s period in seclusion with his family coincided with widespread rumours in America that he had died – an escalation of the three-year-old &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; rumour. The rumour was dispelled by journalists from BBC Radio and &quot;Life&quot; magazine, who tracked him down at his farm, High Park.
McCartney&#x27;s two months in Scotland created an estrangement between him and his bandmates, further to the division caused by their appointment of Allen Klein as business manager in May that year. McCartney later cited Klein&#x27;s appointment as the first &quot;irreconcilable difference&quot; within the Beatles, since he continued to favour New York lawyers Lee Eastman and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of his wife Linda. For McCartney, the period following Lennon&#x27;s departure was also marked by a bout of severe depression, during which, in his own estimation, he came close to suffering a nervous breakdown.

In his book &quot;Fab: An Intimate Life of Paul McCartney&quot;, Howard Sounes writes of the McCartneys&#x27; exile at High Park: &quot;This was grim for Linda. She had a seven-year-old and a baby to look after, with a husband who was depressed and drunk. She later told friends it was one of the most difficult times in her life, while Paul reflected that he might have become a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll casualty at this point in his career.&quot; With Linda&#x27;s encouragement, McCartney began to consider a future outside the Beatles, by writing or finishing songs for his first solo album, &quot;McCartney&quot;.

==Content and recording==
===Studer home recordings, December 1969 – January 1970===
McCartney and his family returned to London shortly before Christmas 1969, and he started work on the album at his home in Cavendish Avenue, St John&#x27;s Wood. The recordings were carried out on a recently delivered Studer four-track tape recorder, without a mixing desk, and therefore without VU displays as a guide for recording levels. McCartney described his home-recording set-up as &quot;Studer, one mic, and nerve&quot;. He played all the musical instruments on the album – from acoustic and electric guitars and bass to keyboards, drums and various percussion instruments – with Linda supplying backing vocals on some songs.

The album&#x27;s recordings eschewed the musical sophistication that distinguished the Beatles&#x27; work with producer George Martin, particularly the band&#x27;s 1969 release &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. According to &quot;The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;McCartney&quot; is &quot;a one-man-studio-band LP&quot; with &quot;a pronounced homemade quality; it was spare and sounded almost unfinished&quot;. Rodriguez writes that in his avoidance of the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; studio aesthetic, &quot;In his own way, [McCartney] was fulfilling the &#x27;as-nature-intended&#x27; theme of the aborted &#x27;Get Back&#x27; sessions, albeit as a one-and-a-half man band.&quot;

McCartney first taped a 45-second portion of a song he wrote in Campbeltown, &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot;. As with much of the album, McCartney sang the composition accompanied by acoustic guitar before filling the remaining tracks on the Studer with a second guitar part, bass and percussive accompaniment. Although this performance of &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot; was only intended as a test of the new equipment, it would be included on the official release, as the opening track, complete with the sound of McCartney giggling at the end of the recording. Reflected in the sequencing of the album, the second and third songs McCartney taped were &quot;That Would Be Something&quot;, also written in Scotland, and the instrumental &quot;Valentine Day&quot;. The latter was one of three selections on &quot;McCartney&quot; that its creator &quot;ad-libbed on the spot&quot;, he later claimed, along with the similarly rock-oriented &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; and &quot;Oo You&quot;.

On 3 January 1970, he interrupted work on &quot;McCartney&quot; to participate in the Beatles&#x27; final recording session, when he, George Harrison and Ringo Starr recorded the Harrison composition &quot;I Me Mine&quot; at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). The next day, the three musicians revisited McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Let It Be&quot;, a song recorded by the band in January 1969 for their forthcoming &quot;Get Back&quot; film project.

===Morgan Studios, February 1970===
On 12 February, McCartney took his Studer tapes to Morgan Studios, in the north-west London suburb of Willesden, in order to copy all the four-track recordings onto eight-track tape, to allow for further overdubbing. To maintain the project&#x27;s secrecy, McCartney worked at Morgan under the pseudonym &quot;Billy Martin&quot;. By this point, he had also taped &quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; at Cavendish Avenue, two songs he began writing during the Beatles&#x27; 1968 visit to India and had rehearsed with the band in January 1969. The other recordings transferred to eight-track included &quot;Glasses&quot; – a sound effects piece featuring &quot;wineglasses played at random&quot;, in McCartney&#x27;s description – and &quot;Singalong Junk&quot;, an instrumental version of &quot;Junk&quot; to which he now added a strings part played on a Mellotron. Among other overdubs on these eight-track mixes, McCartney supplied a vocal to the previously instrumental &quot;Oo You&quot;.

While at Morgan, he also taped &quot;Hot as Sun&quot;, a &quot;Polynesian-influenced&quot; instrumental dating from the late 1950s, according to author Bruce Spizer, and &quot;Kreen-Akrore&quot;, which Sounes describes as an &quot;experimental percussion track&quot;. Recorded on 15 February, &quot;Kreen-Akrore&quot; was McCartney&#x27;s attempt to describe sonically a hunt by the Kreen-Akrore tribespeople of the Brazilian Amazon, after he had watched an ATV documentary on their way of life. Amid musical interludes featuring electric guitar, organ and piano, McCartney used a bow and arrow he purchased at the Knightsbridge department store Harrods, according to engineer Robin Black. The latter was among the few people who knew that McCartney was making a solo album. Linda contributed the breathing and animal-like sounds, with McCartney, on &quot;Kreen-Akrore&quot;.

===EMI Studios, February–March 1970 ===

On 21 February 1970, McCartney moved to the more familiar EMI Studios, with the booking again under the name of Billy Martin. There, he carried out further mixing on the previously recorded material, as well as taping new selections. On 22 February, McCartney recorded &quot;Every Night&quot; – another composition rehearsed during the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, and a song that authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note as the &quot;first &#x27;professional&#x27; recording&quot; on the finished album, given its position as track 4, following &quot;Valentine Day&quot;. On 15 February McCartney recorded &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot;, a piano-based ballad dedicated to Linda, and, in Madinger and Easter&#x27;s description, &quot;the most elaborate instrumental track on the LP&quot;. The final new recording for &quot;McCartney&quot; was &quot;Man We Was Lonely&quot;, which he taped on 25 February, having composed it earlier that day. It is the track on the album on which Linda&#x27;s vocals are most audible.

Final mixes of songs such as &quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; were completed at Morgan Studios along with the remaining tracks on the album. During this process, &quot;Hot as Sun&quot; and &quot;Glasses&quot; were segued into a medley, ending with a snippet of McCartney performing the song &quot;Suicide&quot; on piano. Unacknowledged in the track listing for the album, &quot;Suicide&quot; was a composition that he had intended for Frank Sinatra to record. He also edited two separate instrumental pieces into one for &quot;Momma Miss America&quot;; McCartney can be heard shouting the first portion&#x27;s original title, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Springtime&quot;, on the recording.

On 23 March, while American producer Phil Spector began mixing the &quot;Get Back&quot; tapes for release as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in EMI&#x27;s Studio 4, McCartney completed work on his album in Studio 2. Although McCartney has frequently maintained that he was ignorant of Spector&#x27;s involvement until receiving an acetate copy of &quot;Let It Be&quot; for approval, author Peter Doggett writes that after &quot;several weeks&quot;, McCartney had finally &quot;answered the string of messages he&#x27;d received about Phil Spector&quot; and had agreed to let him prepare &quot;Let It Be&quot; for release.

==Artwork==

For the album&#x27;s gatefold cover, artist Gordon House and designer Roger Huggett worked on a design concept by McCartney. Photos by Linda McCartney featured throughout the packaging, including a collage of 21 family snapshots in the jacket&#x27;s inner spread. The images depicted Paul, Linda, seven-year-old Heather (Linda&#x27;s daughter by her first marriage), newborn Mary, and the McCartneys&#x27; sheepdog, Martha. The gatefold cover of &quot;McCartney&quot; was the first of close to 30 years of albums by her husband to feature Linda McCartney&#x27;s photography.

Set against a black background, the front cover image consisted of a bowl of cherry-red liquid placed on a cream-coloured wall and surrounded by loose red cherries, as if the fruit had been emptied from the bowl. On the back cover, a photo taken by Linda in Scotland showed her husband with Mary tucked inside his fur-lined leather jacket. Madinger and Easter comment that, unlike Lennon, McCartney did not feel the need to include his wife on the cover, and her back-cover photo was a &quot;stunning&quot; contribution from the former professional photographer. In a 2013 news article recalling the album&#x27;s release, the Philadelphia radio station WMMR described the photo of McCartney and his baby daughter as &quot;iconic&quot; and reflective of &quot;his ultimate message: &#x27;Home, family (and) love&#x27;.&quot;

==Release==
===Scheduling conflict===

McCartney said that he &quot;boycotted&quot; Apple&#x27;s offices after Klein&#x27;s arrival in 1969. His continued isolation in 1970 led to Lennon, Harrison and Starr making business decisions without McCartney&#x27;s input. One decision concerned the release of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; documentary, a necessity in order to fulfil the Beatles&#x27; contractual obligations to film company United Artists. McCartney privately agreed to a mid-April release date for &quot;McCartney&quot; with Apple Records executive Neil Aspinall, one of the few people associated with the Beatles who was aware of the project. Its late addition to Apple&#x27;s schedule clashed with the imminent release of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, and of Starr&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, which was due out on 27 March. On 25 March, after discovering that Klein arranged to have the release of &quot;McCartney&quot; postponed, McCartney received an assurance from Harrison, as a director of Apple Records, that his solo album would be issued on 17 April, as planned.

The situation then changed when Spector reported that work on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album was almost complete, meaning that it could be issued to coincide with the film&#x27;s world premiere, which was scheduled for 28 April, in New York. Doggett writes that &quot;the solution was obvious&quot;, since &quot;Let It Be&quot; was &quot;a multimedia package&quot; and, as a band venture rather than a solo album, it &quot;should automatically take precedence&quot;. Harrison and Lennon therefore wrote to McCartney on 31 March to say that they had instructed EMI, Apple&#x27;s parent label, to postpone his album until 4 June; they also explained the need to stagger the various new releases, particularly in America, where the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; compilation had been issued on 26 February. Rather than have a member of staff deliver the letter to McCartney at Cavendish Avenue, Starr decided to take it to him personally.

McCartney later described the tone of Starr&#x27;s message as &quot;the party line&quot;, to which he reacted badly: &quot;I told [Starr] to get out. I had to do something like that in order to assert myself because I was just sinking ... I was getting pummelled about the head, in my mind anyway.&quot; According to Starr, McCartney &quot;went crazy&quot;, threatening: &quot;I&#x27;ll finish you now. You&#x27;ll pay!&quot; Although the other Beatles backed down over the release of &quot;McCartney&quot;, the confrontation initiated what Rodriguez terms &quot;a three-against-one war&quot; within the band.

===Press release and the Beatles&#x27; break-up===

On 9 April, McCartney released a Q&amp;A package to the British press, in which he explained his reasons for making his solo album and described its overall theme as &quot;Home, Family, Love&quot;. Compiled with the help of Apple executives Derek Taylor and Peter Brown, the self-interview also contained questions McCartney imagined he would be asked regarding the possibility of the Beatles splitting up. While stopping short of saying that the band was finished, McCartney stated that he did not know whether his &quot;break with the Beatles&quot; would be temporary or permanent and that it was based on business, personal and creative differences. He also said that he had not missed Starr&#x27;s drumming, nor any of his bandmates&#x27; contributions, when making the album, and could not envisage a time when he and Lennon would write together again. When asked whether Klein and his company ABKCO would be &quot;in any way involved with the production, manufacturing, distribution or promotion of this new album&quot;, McCartney said, &quot;Not if I can help it&quot;, and he stressed that Klein was in no way his business representative. Although McCartney later recalled that he was responding to questions put to him, Brown said that McCartney wrote all the questions, as did Taylor.

That same day, McCartney called Lennon at the clinic where he was undergoing primal scream therapy with his wife, Yoko Ono. McCartney told him that he was following Lennon&#x27;s example and leaving the Beatles, but he made no mention of making his departure public. Doggett suggests that McCartney&#x27;s intention was not necessarily to break up the band, and cites Beatles confidant Ray Connolly&#x27;s recollection that McCartney was &quot;devastated&quot; by the media&#x27;s interpretation of his self-interview. The first reaction from the press was a piece by Don Short of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, on 10 April, titled &quot;PAUL IS QUITTING THE BEATLES&quot;. From there, in author Mark Hertsgaard&#x27;s description, &quot;newspaper headlines around the world reduced the story to screaming variations of PAUL BREAKS UP THE BEATLES&quot;.

===Sales and promotion===

&quot;McCartney&quot; was released in Britain on 17 April 1970 (as Apple PCS 7102), and three days later in America (Apple STAO 3363). While the reports about the Beatles&#x27; break-up resulted in McCartney&#x27;s standing among Beatles fans to plummet, they also ensured that the album was highly publicised. Adding to this exposure in the US, McCartney commissioned a second set of print advertisements for the album, to counter what Doggett describes as Klein&#x27;s &quot;incendiary statement of fact&quot; in the official advertisements that Apple was &quot;an ABKCO-managed company&quot;.

In the UK, &quot;McCartney&quot; debuted at number 2, where it remained for three weeks behind the best-selling album of 1970, Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. By 15 May, &quot;McCartney&quot; had sold over 1 million copies in the US, and from 23 May, began a three-week stay at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, eventually going double platinum. Despite &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; receiving considerable airplay on US radio, McCartney refused to issue it or any other song from the album as a single.

McCartney&#x27;s former bandmates viewed his making the band&#x27;s break-up public as a betrayal in light of how Lennon had acquiesced to the group&#x27;s interests by staying silent about his departure the previous year, and as McCartney using the end of the Beatles as a way to promote his solo album. When asked for his opinion of the album shortly after its release, Harrison described &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; and &quot;That Would Be Something&quot; as &quot;great&quot;, but the rest, he said, &quot;just don&#x27;t do much for me&quot;. Harrison added that, unlike Lennon, Starr and himself, McCartney was probably too &quot;isolated&quot; from other musicians, such that: &quot;The only person he&#x27;s got to tell him if the song&#x27;s good or bad is Linda.&quot; In a December 1970 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner, which was re-published the following year as the book &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot;, Lennon dismissed &quot;McCartney&quot; as &quot;rubbish&quot; and &quot;Engelbert Humperdinck music&quot;; he said that his primal therapy-inspired album &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; would &quot;probably scare [McCartney] into doing something decent&quot;. Lennon rejected Wenner&#x27;s interpretation of the back cover portrait as a possible reference to Ono&#x27;s recent miscarriage; instead, he read it as an example of the McCartneys slavishly following his and Ono&#x27;s lead by releasing a family-oriented album.

&quot;McCartney&quot; was followed by two sequels, &quot;McCartney II&quot; (released in 1980), and &quot;McCartney III&quot; (released in December 2020), both sharing the same recording technique as this album.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
On release, &quot;McCartney&quot; was widely criticised for being under-produced and for its unfinished songs. In addition, according to Nicholas Schaffner in his 1977 book &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s attempt to use the Beatles&#x27; break-up to promote his solo album, while presenting himself as a happy family man, &quot;apparently backfired&quot;, since &quot;many observers found the whole thing contrived, tasteless, and rather vicious.&quot; Madinger and Easter write of the album receiving a &quot;critical lambasting&quot; and that the &quot;general sentiment&quot; among reviewers was &quot;something to the effect of &#x27;He broke up the Beatles for &quot;this&quot;?!?&#x27;&quot; Richard Williams of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; suggested that &quot;With this record, [McCartney&#x27;s] debt to George Martin becomes increasingly clear ...&quot; Williams found &quot;sheer banality&quot; in all the tracks save for &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; and described &quot;Man We Was Lonely&quot; as &quot;the worst example of his music-hall side&quot;.

In a favourable assessment, for the &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith wrote that while on first listen he found &quot;McCartney&quot; &quot;too harmlessly mild&quot;, his view had changed with time, such that: &quot;Listening to it is like hearing a man&#x27;s personal contentment committed to the sound of music. Most of the sounds, effects and ideas are sheer brilliance; much of the aura is of quiet songs on a hot summer night; and virtually all of the tracks reflect a kind of intangible roundness. &#x27;Excitement&#x27; is not a word to use for this album ... &#x27;warmth&#x27; and &#x27;happiness&#x27; are.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith/NME&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his combined review of all the former Beatles&#x27; 1970 solo releases, Geoffrey Cannon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dismissed it as an album that had &quot;no substance&quot;. Cannon continued: &quot;Paul reveals himself in it as a man preoccupied with himself, and his own situation. The music is boastfully casual … He seems to believe that anything that comes into his head is worth having. And he&#x27;s wrong.&quot; John Gabree of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine similarly bemoaned the expectation that &quot;we should dig his every little noise&quot; and found the reasons for the album&#x27;s failure evident in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film, where McCartney appeared to be &quot;the only Beatle who has stagnated as a human being&quot;, as well as &quot;incredibly arrogant&quot; in his treatment of his bandmates. Gabree added that &quot;Perhaps the greatest disappointment lies in the songs, although most of them could have been saved by better performances, especially the instrumentals.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Langdon Winner found the songs &quot;distinctly second rate&quot; relative to McCartney&#x27;s best compositions as a Beatle, with only &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; &quot;even com[ing] close&quot; to matching that high standard, but he admired McCartney&#x27;s vocals and added: &quot;if one can accept the album in its own terms, &quot;McCartney&quot; stands as a very good, although not astounding, piece of work.&quot; Winner admitted to being repelled by the &quot;tawdry propaganda&quot; surrounding the release, however, about which he emphasised: &quot;Remember, this is all stuff that Paul himself deliberately included [in the album&#x27;s press kit], not just some idle comments he let slip to a probing journalist.&quot; The reviewer concluded: &quot;I like &quot;McCartney&quot; very much. But I remember that the people of Troy also liked that wooden horse they wheeled through their gates until they discovered that it was hollow inside and full of hostile warriors.&quot;

===Retrospective assessments===

In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Greg Kot deems the album &quot;so modest it barely registers&quot; in comparison with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, adding: &quot;Only the white soul of &#x27;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&#x27; distinguishes otherwise unbearably slight confections such as &#x27;Lovely Linda.&#x27;&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that &quot;McCartney&quot; possesses &quot;an endearingly ragged, homemade quality&quot;, with &quot;That Would Be Something&quot;, &quot;Every Night&quot;, &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; all &quot;full-fledged McCartney classics&quot;. Although he notes that &quot;the throwaway nature of much of the material ... has become charming in retrospect&quot;, Erlewine adds: &quot;Unfortunately, in retrospect it also appears as a harbinger of the nagging mediocrity that would plague McCartney&#x27;s entire solo career.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; has highlighted &quot;Every Night&quot;, &quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; as songs that &quot;still sound absolutely effortless and demonstrate the man&#x27;s natural genius with a melody&quot;.

Among Beatle biographers, Robert Rodriguez includes &quot;McCartney&quot; in his chapter covering the worst solo albums issued by the former band members between 1970 and 1980, saying: &quot;For anyone wanting to get to the root of the most common rap against Paul&#x27;s solo output, look no further …&quot; While bemoaning the lack of quality control that allowed &quot;charmless ditties&quot; such as &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; to go under-developed, Rodriguez writes: &quot;What made &quot;McCartney&quot; so frustrating a listen was not the absence of compelling musical ideas; it was the abundance of them. Had melodies like &#x27;Momma Miss America&#x27; been teased out into compositions with a beginning, middle, end, and point, &quot;McCartney&quot; could have ended up as highly regarded in its own way as &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;: a full slate of focused, listener-friendly pop confections that might very well have given fans far less cause for bitterness at the Beatles&#x27; breakup.&quot;

In 1999, Neil Young inducted McCartney into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and praised &quot;McCartney&quot;, saying: &quot;I loved that record because it was so simple. And there was so much to see and to hear. It was just Paul. There was no adornment at all ... There was no attempt made to compete with the things he had already done. And so out he stepped from the shadow of the Beatles.&quot; McCartney subsequently told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that, given the album&#x27;s homemade qualities, he considered it to be rock music&#x27;s first indie album, adding: &quot;Y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s now what would be called an &#x27;indie&#x27; thing. To me, then, it was just ... knockin&#x27; around experimentin&#x27; with some sounds and not &quot;worrying&quot; how it was gonna turn out. I think that was one of the secrets.&quot; Citing its home recording and mixing, Brent Day of &quot;Paste&quot; felt that &quot;McCartney&quot; was arguably &quot;one of the first big lo-fi records of its day.&quot; It was one of McCartney&#x27;s two post-Beatle albums that was included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;McCartney&quot; was released on CD on 7 June 1993, along with six other studio albums McCartney made during the 1970s, including &quot;Ram&quot; (with Linda) and &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (with their band Wings).

On 13 June 2011, the album and McCartney&#x27;s second official solo work, &quot;McCartney II&quot;, were reissued together by Hear Music/Concord Music Group as part of The &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. The album re-entered the charts in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Japan. On 17 November 2017, &quot;McCartney&quot; was re-released by Capitol/UMe without bonus tracks as part of McCartney&#x27;s 2016 return to Capitol Records and a catalogue service agreement taking over from Concord Records and Hear Music.

&quot;McCartney&quot; received a special 50th anniversary release in a limited edition half-speed mastered vinyl pressing for Record Store Day on 26 September 2020.

The album was reissued on 5 August 2022 in a boxset entitled &quot;McCartney I II III&quot;, consisting of 3 LPs or 3 CDs, along with the second and third albums of the trilogy.

<text>Venera 7 () was a Soviet spacecraft, part of the Venera series of probes to Venus. When it landed on the Venusian surface on 15 December 1970, it became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth.

==Design==

The lander was designed to be able to survive pressure of up to and temperatures of . This was much greater than what was expected to be encountered but significant uncertainties as to the surface temperatures and pressure of Venus resulted in the designers opting for a large margin of error. This degree of hardening limited the amount of mass available for scientific instruments both on the probe itself and the interplanetary bus. The interplanetary bus carried a solar-wind charged-particle detector and a cosmic-ray detector. On the lander were temperature and pressure sensors as well as an accelerometer to measure atmospheric density. The probe also carried a radar altimeter.

== Launch ==
The probe was launched from Earth on 17 August 1970, at 05:38 UTC. It consisted of an interplanetary bus, based on the 3MV system, and a lander. During the flight to Venus, two in-course corrections were made using the bus&#x27;s on-board KDU-414 engine.

== Landing ==
Venera 7 entered the atmosphere of Venus on 15 December 1970. The lander remained attached to the interplanetary bus during the initial stages of atmospheric entry to allow the bus to cool the lander to for as long as possible. The lander was ejected once atmospheric buffeting broke the interplanetary bus&#x27;s lock-on with Earth. The parachute opened at a height of , and atmospheric testing began with results showing the atmosphere to be 97% carbon dioxide. The parachute was initially reefed down to , opening to 13 minutes later, after the reefing line melted as designed. Six minutes after the unreefing, the parachute started to fail, resulting in a descent more rapid than planned. The parachute eventually failed completely, and the probe entered a period of freefall. As a result, the lander struck the surface of Venus at about at 05:37:10 UTC. The landing coordinates are .

The probe appeared to go silent on impact, but recording tapes kept rolling. A few weeks later, upon review of the tapes by radio astronomer Oleg Rzhiga, another 23 minutes of very weak signals were found on them. The spacecraft had landed on Venus, and probably bounced onto its side, leaving the medium gain antenna aimed incorrectly for proper signal transmission to Earth.

The probe transmitted information to Earth for 53 minutes, which included about 20 minutes from the surface. It was found that the temperature at the surface of Venus was . Using this temperature and models of the atmosphere, a pressure of was calculated. From the spacecraft&#x27;s rapid halt (from falling to stationary inside 0.2 second), it was possible to conclude that the craft had hit a solid surface with low levels of dust.

The probe provided information about the surface of Venus that could not be seen through its thick atmospheric veil. The spacecraft confirmed that humans cannot survive on the surface of Venus. It excluded the possibility that there is any liquid water on the planet.

<doc id="1131887" wikidata="Q5262388" url="?curid=1131887" title="Derek Summerfield">
<text>Derek Summerfield is an honorary senior lecturer at London&#x27;s Institute of Psychiatry and a member of the Executive Committee of Transcultural Special Interest Group at the Royal College of Psychiatry. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Egyptian Psychiatric Association. He has published around 150 papers and has made other contributions in medical and social sciences literature.

== Clinical background ==

Dr. Summerfield was born in South Africa. He qualified in medicine at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London. During his working career, he has been Principal Psychiatrist with the Medical Foundation for Care of Victims of Torture in London, Honorary Senior Lecturer at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School at the University of London and a consultant to Oxfam on projects in war-affected settings. He was a Research/Teaching Associate for the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford.

== Research and publications ==

In 1995 he participated in a study on the psychiatric effects of the detention and torture of Palestinian political prisoners. He has been involved with various studies on the effects of war and atrocity, and of displacement and asylum-seeking in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Bosnia and the UK. He has published extensively on the effects of torture as well as the effects of war-related violence on women and children. He drew international attention with a series of publications questioning the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder, criticizing the medicalization of psychotherapy for trauma and the exaggeration of mental illness statistics. Recently he has argued that global mental health statistics should take into account differing ethnopsychiatric definitions.

== Palestinian controversy ==

Summerfield has been a vocal critic of the Israeli Government&#x27;s actions against Palestinians and of what he believes are Israeli physicians&#x27; violations of medical ethics. An October 16, 2004 editorial published by the British Medical Journal, concerning what he described as the level of Israeli violence against Palestinian children generated controversy and a number of responses both negative and positive. He also attempted unsuccessfully to force Yoram Blachar to resign as head of the World Medical Association after spearheading a petition drive claiming Blachar supported torture while he was working in Israel.

==Critical Psychiatry==

Dr. Summerfield is a member of UK branch of The International Critical Psychiatry Network.

<text>Jonathan Meredith (about 1772 – August 7, 1805) was a United States Marine during the First Barbary War.

==Biography==
Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Meredith enlisted in the Marine Corps June 6, 1803 and was promoted to Sergeant August 1, of the same year.

During an engagement in the harbor of Tripoli August 3, 1805, Sergeant Meredith saved the life of Lieutenant John Trippe of USS &quot;Vixen&quot;, who with a party of nine men had boarded a Tripolitan ship. Heavily outnumbered, the boarding party fought a fierce hand-to-hand combat, in which Trippe was severely wounded; Meredith protected him from what would have been the final blow. Four days later Meredith was killed in the explosion of Gunboat No. 3 during a similar attack against the Tripolitans.

<text>Labashi-Marduk ( or , meaning &quot;O Marduk, may I not come to shame&quot;) was the fifth and penultimate king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling in 556 BC. He was the son and successor of Neriglissar. Though classical authors such as Berossus wrote that Labashi-Marduk was just a child when he became king, Babylonian documents indicate that he had been in charge of his own affairs before his rise to the throne, suggesting he was an adult, though possibly still relatively young.

Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s reign was very short, lasting only one to three months, with the last evidence of Neriglissar&#x27;s life dating in April 556 BC and documents dated to Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s successor, Nabonidus, appearing in May that same year and becoming widespread in Babylonia by the end of June. Nabonidus&#x27;s son Belshazzar led a coup against the king, deposing and killing Labashi-Marduk and proclaiming Nabonidus as king. The reason for Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s deposition is unknown, Berossus simply describes the justification as Labashi-Marduk having indulged in &quot;evil ways&quot;. One possible explanation is that whereas Neriglissar derived his claim to the throne from having married a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II, a previous king, Labashi-Marduk may have been wholly unconnected to the Babylonian ruling dynasty, as a result of being the son of another wife.

== Background ==

Labashi-Marduk was the son and heir of Neriglissar (560–556 BC), the fourth king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s mother was a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC), the empire&#x27;s second and most powerful king. Three daughters of Nebuchadnezzar are known; Kashshaya, Innin-etirat and Ba&#x27;u-asitu, but no cuneiform text explicitly mentions which daughter Neriglissar married. Historian David B. Weisberg proposed in 1974 that Neriglissar&#x27;s wife was Kashshaya, since her name appears together with the name of Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar in economic documents. Though no concrete evidence exists, this identification has generally been accepted by subsequent historians, such as Donald Wiseman and Jona Lendering.

Neriglissar was the son of a man by the name Bel-shum-ishkun and might originally have been from the Aramean clan of the Puqudu, since Bel-shum-ishkun is recorded as originating in the Babylonian province of the same name. According to the later Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer and astronomer Berossus, Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar) died of sickness after a reign of 43 years and was succeeded by his son Euilmaradokhos (Amel-Marduk), who &quot;ruled capriciously and had no regard for the laws&quot;. After a reign of two years, Neriglassaros (Neriglissar) plotted against Amel-Marduk and had him deposed and killed. If Berossus is to be believed, Neriglissar was the leader of this conspiracy. It is likely that the conflict between Amel-Marduk and Neriglissar was a case of inter-family discord rather than some other form of rivalry. Neriglissar&#x27;s claim to the throne likely came through his marriage to Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughter, who might have been significantly older than either of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s sons (as she is attested significantly earlier in her father&#x27;s reign).

== Reign ==
Neriglissar probably died in April 556 BC. The last known documents dated to Neriglissar&#x27;s reign are a contract from 12 April 556 BC at Babylon and a contract from 16 April that same year from the city of Uruk. The Uruk King List (IM 65066, also known as King List 5), a record of rulers of Babylon from Shamash-shum-ukin (668–648 BC) to the Seleucid king Seleucus II Callinicus (246–225 BC), accords Neriglissar a reign of three years and eight months, consistent with the possibility that Neriglissar died in April.

Labashi-Marduk thus became king of Babylon, but his reign proved to be brief. Because he reigned for such a short period of time, no inscriptions survive from his time as king. Berossus erroneously gives Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s reign as nine months (though it is possible that this is a scribal error) and states that Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s &quot;evil ways&quot; led to his friends plotting against him, eventually resulting in the child king being beaten to death. The plotters then agreed that Nabonnedos (Nabonidus), one of the plotters, should rule. The Uruk King List only gives Labashi-Marduk a reign of three months and contract tablets from Babylonia suggest that he might have ruled as briefly as just two months. It appears the transition in leadership was either a brief period of confusion after a discrete palace coup, or a brief civil war. Labashi-Marduk was still recognised as king at Uruk up until at least 19 June, and in the key city of Sippar until at least 20 June. The earliest known document dated to the reign of Nabonidus at Sippar is from 26 June. However, the earliest document dated to Nabonidus at the city of Nippur is from 25 May and the latest documents dated to Labashi-Marduk at Babylon itself are from 24 May. The earliest known tablet dated to Nabonidus at Babylon is from 14 July. This evidence can be reconciled by positing that Nabonidus may have been recognised in the Babylonian heartland, including Nippur and Babylon, already on 25 May, whereas some outlying cities continued to recognise Labashi-Marduk (even though he quite possibly was dead at the time on account of a possible palace coup) as king until June. By the end of June 556 BC, tablets dated to Nabonidus are known from across Babylonia.

Although Berossus refers to Labashi-Marduk as a child, it possible that he became king as an adult since commercial texts from two years earlier indicate that Labashi-Marduk was in charge of his own affairs at that time. Labashi-Marduk may still have been relatively young, however. One of the inscriptions of Nabonidus refers to Labashi-Marduk as &quot;a young boy who had not yet learned proper behavior&quot;.

The reason for the coup against Labashi-Marduk is unknown. It is possible that despite Labashi-Marduk and his father being well-connected and wealthy, they were ultimately seen as commoners, lacking noble blood. Though his mother would have connected him to the royal dynasty as the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, it is also possible that Labashi-Marduk was the son of Neriglissar and another of his wives. Thus, Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s rise to the throne might have signified a true break in the dynasty of Nebuchadnezzar and might as such have aroused opposition from the Babylonian populace. After Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s death, the considerable wealth and estates of Neriglissar&#x27;s family were confiscated and eventually taken up by Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, who (as the main beneficiary) was likely the main orchestrator of the conspiracy against Labashi-Marduk.

<doc id="1131899" wikidata="Q356564" url="?curid=1131899" title="Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse">
<text>Raymond VI (; 27 October 1156 – 2 August 1222) was Count of Toulouse and Marquis of Provence from 1194 to 1222. He was also Count of Melgueil (as Raymond IV) from 1173 to 1190.

==Early life==
Raymond was born at Saint-Gilles, Gard, the son of Raymond V and Constance of France. His maternal grandparents were Louis VI of France and his second wife Adélaide de Maurienne. His maternal uncles included Louis VII of France. In 1194 he succeeded his father as count of Toulouse. He immediately re-established peace with both Alfonso II of Aragon and with the Trencavel family.

==Problems with the Church==
Raymond VI was arguably the first target of the Albigensian crusade (1209–1229).

Raymond VI held vast territories but his control of them was problematic. Aside from theoretically owing allegiance to the King of France, Raymond held Provence as a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry II of England controlled neighboring Aquitaine through his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, who had a claim to Toulouse through her grandmother, Philippa of Toulouse, daughter of William IV, Count of Toulouse. Alfonso II of Aragon was involved in the affairs of Languedoc, stimulating emigration from the north to colonize newly reconquered lands in Aragon.

In Toulouse, Raymond maintained the communal freedoms, extended exemptions from taxation, and extended his protection to the communal territory. A poet and a man of culture, he hated war but did not lack energy.

According to Henri Pirenne, &quot;At the end of the 12th century Languedoc was swarming with those mystics who aspired to lead the Church and the age back to apostolic simplicity, condemning both the religious hierarchy and the social order&quot;. At first Innocent III tried to deal with the Cathars by peaceful conversion, sending into the affected regions a number of legates or representatives. Count Raymond declined to assist, although constantly embroiled with his vassals, and given the autonomy of the towns, Kenneth Setton questions whether Raymond &quot;could have coped effectively with the challenge of heresy even if he had wished to do so&quot;.

The legates sent from Rome and France received little support as they were considered foreign reformers. Papal legate Pierre de Castelnau was sent to address Raymond&#x27;s tolerance for the practice of the Cathars, but withdrew for six months in 1206 out of concerns for his safety.

Pierre&#x27;s assassination on 15 January 1208, led to Raymond&#x27;s excommunication. This was followed by the capture and massacre of Béziers, the siege and capture of Carcassonne, and the death of Raymond Roger Trencavel, all in 1209. That same year Raymond had journeyed to Rome in an attempt to reconcile with Pope Innocent III, yet despite his overtures Innocent chose to allow crusade leaders a freehand. In 1211, Raymond&#x27;s excommunication was reiterated by papal legates, while the Council of Montpellier placed an Interdict over the County of Toulouse. More of a diplomat than a soldier, he was unable to stop the advance of Simon de Montfort, who conquered Toulouse. Following Battle of Muret, Raymond was exiled to England under his former brother-in-law John, King of England.

In November 1215, Raymond and his son (the later Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse) were in Rome with Raymond-Roger, Count of Foix on the occasion of the Fourth Lateran Council to vindicate themselves and dispute the loss of their territories. Raymond&#x27;s son-in-law, Pierre-Bermond II of Sauve, was also there to lay claim to the county of Toulouse, but this claim failed. Raymond and his son went from Rome to Genoa and thence to Marseille in February 1216. Raymond&#x27;s son set out from Marseille to regain the family territories in Provence; in May 1216 he besieged Beaucaire and captured it on August 24.

Meanwhile, Raymond went to Aragon, hoping to rally support. From there he engaged in secret negotiations with leaders in Toulouse during 1216. Simon de Montfort possibly believed that Raymond was on his way to the city in September 1216; at any rate he returned in great haste from Beaucaire and conducted a partial sack of the city, apparently intended as punishment. Finally, on 12 September 1217, Raymond re-entered Toulouse again. Simon de Montfort immediately besieged the city once more. Simon was killed during the siege (25 June 1218); his son Amaury VI of Montfort took his place, and for five years the Crusade faltered. The failure of Louis VIII&#x27;s campaigns, from 1219 to 1226, finally permitted Raymond, and his son and successor, to recover most of their territories.

==Death==
Following an abrupt and unexpected illness that left him mostly speechless, Raymond died in August 1222. But from what was said, he was still able to remember and understand things because he extended his hands in a show of devotion to the Abbot of Saint-Sernin, as soon as the Abbot hurried to his side. He kissed a pall bearing a cross when the Brothers of the Hospital of St. John threw it over him, and then he died unexpectedly. His body was taken to their home, but it was never buried there and is still unburied as of now.

In 1998, there was a new twist to this story: during excavations at the &quot;Hôtel Saint-Jean&quot; in Toulouse, the site of the former Grand Priory of the Knights Hospitaller, a medieval sarcophagus was discovered, and for a moment it was believed that it might contain the bones of Raymond VI. The mayor of Toulouse, Dominique Baudis, took the opportunity to ask the Pope to lift Raymond VI&#x27;s excommunication, without success.

==Marriages==
Raymond was married six times:

# On 11 December 1172, to Ermessende of Pelet, Countess of Melgueil. She died in 1176 without issue.
# In 1178 to Beatrice of Béziers, sister of Roger II Trencavel. She left Raymond and retired to a nunnery. Raymond VI and Beatrice had one daughter:
##Constance of Toulouse, who was married first to King Sancho VII of Navarre, and secondly to Pierre-Bermond II of Sauve, Lord of Anduze.
# In 1193 to Bourgogne de Lusignan, daughter of Amaury II, King of Cyprus. She was repudiated in 1196.
#In October 1196 at Rouen to Joan Plantagenet, daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Their marriage included Richard I&#x27;s renunciation of his claim to Toulouse, ending the feud with the ducal house of Aquitaine. She died on 4 September 1199, in childbirth as a veiled nun at Fontevraud Abbey. Joan and Raymond VI had three children:
##Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse (1197–1249);
##Joan of Toulouse (1198–1255), second wife of Bernard II de la Tour, Lord of la Tour;
##Richard of Toulouse (1199), lived just long enough to be baptised.
# In 1200 to the daughter of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. They divorced in late 1202, and she remarried to Thierry of Flanders by early 1203.
# In January 1204 to Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancha of Castile.

==In art==

Raymond VI is represented as one of four figures on the ceiling of the Minnesota Supreme Court in the United States. His painting is next to Moses, Confucius, and Socrates, each painting representing an aspect of law. Raymond VI&#x27;s painting is entitled &quot;The Adjustment of Conflicting Interests&quot;, and the scene is of Raymond VI of Toulouse standing before the papal legate in 1208. Raymond argued successfully for city freedoms, extended exemptions from taxation, and protection of the communal territory from the church. Not wanting to target his Cathar vassals, he also defended, albeit with less success—since it became one of the causes of the Albigensian Crusade—the idea of religious freedom. The paintings were made by John LaFarge in 1903.

In 1889, in a painting exhibited at the Capitole in Toulouse and entitled &quot;Raimond VI Count of Toulouse, the excommunicated 1156-1222&quot;, the painter René-Henri Ravaut depicted Raymond VI left at the door of the Church.

<doc id="1131905" wikidata="Q1022430" url="?curid=1131905" title="Rozhdestvenskiy (crater)">
<text>Rozhdestvenskiy is a large lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, within one crater diameter of the north pole. It lies sandwiched between the craters Hermite along the eastern rim, and Plaskett which intrudes slightly into the west-southwestern rim. Just on the opposite side of the pole is the crater Peary.

This formation is a large crater of the form called a walled plain. The outer rim is heavily eroded and rugged, with a somewhat polygonal outline. The relatively young crater Rozhdestvenskiy K overlies the southern rim. To the northwest is a short chain of craters that forms a valley penetrating the rim.

The interior floor of the crater is relatively level with a central peak formation located to the west of the midpoint. Just to the west of this peak is a pair of small craters on the floor. There is also a small crater to the south of the midpoint, and the surface is marked by many tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rozhdestvenskiy.

<doc id="1131906" wikidata="Q477647" url="?curid=1131906" title="Papua New Guinea national soccer team">
<text>The Papua New Guinea national soccer team is the men&#x27;s national soccer team of Papua New Guinea and is controlled by the Papua New Guinea Football Association. Its nickname is the &quot;Kapuls&quot;, which is Tok Pisin for Cuscus.

Papua New Guinea&#x27;s highest ever FIFA ranking was 153, in June 2017. As of April 2024, the country was ranked 166 out of 211 countries. This was a drop of 1 place from February 2024.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA/Coca-Cola-World-Rankings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Papua New Guinea had previously left the FIFA rankings, having not competed in a match between July 2007 and August 2011. Their matches at the 2015 Pacific Games saw them return to the rankings, and they competed in the 2016 OFC Nations Cup in June 2016; they reached the final, but lost to New Zealand 4–2 on penalties after the score was tied at 0–0 after extra time.

==History==

===1963–1978===

The Papuan national team played its first match at the 1963 South Pacific Games, where it fell to Fiji 3-1 and was eliminated. At the 1966 South Pacific Games they reached the third place match but lost to the New Hebrides. Three years later they reached the same stage, and defeated the Fijian team 2-1 to win the bronze medal.

At 1971 South Pacific Games, after losing in the semi-finals to New Caledonia, they were beaten 8-1 by Tahiti in the third place game. Four years later, at the 1975 Games, they were beaten in the group stage by Tahiti and New Caledonia and thus eliminated in the first round.

===1979–1995===
At the 1979 South Pacific Games they lost in the quarter-finals 3–2 against the Solomon Islands, and in the first phase of the consolation tournament they were beaten 2–0 at the hands of the New Hebrides. The following year they played in the 1980 Oceania Cup, the precursor to the OFC Nations Cup, where despite beating the New Hebrides team, their losses to Australia and New Caledonia left them out at the first phase.

At 1983 South Pacific Games they lost the match for third place against the New Caledonian team. In the 1987 edition they won the bronze medal again by beating Vanuatu 3-1. Even so, in the two subsequent editions, 1991 and 1995, they were eliminated in the first phase.

===1996–2012===
After an absence in three editions of the OFC Nations Cup, due to the poor results obtained in the Melanesia Cup, they qualified for the 2002 tournament. They were only able to salvage a point in a 0-0 draw against the Solomon Islands and bowed out in the first round. In 2003 South Pacific Games they had a poor performance and in five games only obtained four points.

After not participating in 2007, which served as qualification for the 2008 OFC Nations Cup, they were eliminated in the first phase at 2011 Pacific Games by having worse goal difference than Tahiti, with whom they tied on points. In the 2012 OFC Nations Cup they drew with Fiji and lost to the Solomon Islands and New Zealand, again being eliminated in the group stage.

===2013–present=== 

In 2015, Papua New Guinea was designated to host the 2016 OFC Nations Cup. In the group stage, the Papuan team drew 1–1 with New Caledonia, 2–2 against Tahiti and beat Samoa 8–0. After achieving victory in the semi-finals, 2–1 against the Solomon Islands, they lost on penalties to New Zealand in the final after drawing 0–0 in regulation time. On 20 June 2023, Papua New Guinea suffered their worst defeat in their history losing to Malaysia 10–0 at the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium.

==== FIFA Series tournament ====
In 2024, Papua New Guinea played their first ever tournament outside Oceania where FIFA invited them to the 2024 FIFA Series matches on from 22 to 25 March 2024 held in Colombo where they would face Sri Lanka and Central African Republic.

<doc id="1131907" wikidata="Q6550554" url="?curid=1131907" title="Lincoln College, Lincolnshire">
<text>Lincoln College is a predominantly further education college based in the City of Lincoln, England.

The college&#x27;s main site is on Monks Road (B1308), specifically to the north, and to the south of Lindum Hill (A15). It was formerly known as the Lincoln College of Technology and was one of the sites for North Lincolnshire College.

==Satellite sites==

The college also has sites in Gainsborough, and also in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire (since merging with the former Newark and Sherwood College in 2007).

The two branch sites are branded as Gainsborough College and Newark College respectively.

More than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making it one of the largest educational establishments in the county of Lincolnshire. The college closed its small fourth campus in Louth, Lincolnshire in 2005.

===Gainsborough===
The site was known as Gainsborough College of Further Education, on Morton Terrace. The County Technical College was built from 1938, with a new grammar school. The land was bought by Lincolnshire County Council from Sir Hickman Beckett Bacon, High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1887. It opened in June 1941. At a meeting of Lincolnshire County Council, on Tuesday 17 June 1975, the name was changed from County Technical College.

The Secretary of State for Education, Sir Keith Joseph, visited the college and the grammar schools on Friday 18 June 1982, after visiting Lincoln. He had a buffet lunch prepared by college catering students. Fred Rickard also attended, the director of education for Lincolnshire. Fred Rickard died in May 2010, and had joined Lindsey County Council in 1967, having taught in Leicestershire schools until 1970, becoming director of education in 1978, when aged 50; he was educated at Devonport High School for Boys and the University of Leicester.

The merger with Lincoln was proposed in September 1986, due to the lower birth rate meaning that there was less 16 year olds by the early 1990s. Staff at Gainsborough thought it would mean the closure of the site. The combined site started on 1 September 1987.

==History==

The college was earlier known as Lincoln Technical College and built on Cathedral Street in 1932.

It became Lincoln College of Technology in the early 1970s, then administered by the City of Lincoln Education Committee. In the mid-1980s the college piloted the Technician Engineering Scholarship Scheme (TESS), funded by the Engineering Industry Training Board, a scheme for women.

Two new blocks were added between 1976 and 1978, for business and management studies.

North Lincolnshire College (known as NLC from 1989) was created on 1 September 1987 by Lincolnshire County Council from combining the Lincoln site with Gainsborough College of Further Education and part of the Louth Further Education Centre.

It previously had its headquarters on Cathedral Street until 1993. In the early 1990s it offered degrees and HNDs in Business Studies, Electronics, and Computer Studies in conjunction with Nottingham Trent University, becoming an associate college in 1994. In 1997 the Principal, Allan Crease, in a speech to the Association of Colleges criticised the means of funding from the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), where money was allocated by numbers at the college, and staff received less pay than those at school.

In the late 1990s the University of Lincoln was being developed, subsuming Lincoln College of Art, and offered similar courses to the college, but the university was not fully built until the mid-2000s. In the late 1990s the college had a student population of around 15,000 and over 20,000 by 2001.

It soon after changed its name to Lincoln College, not least because North Lincolnshire was an area not covered by the college. From 2010 it was funded by the East Midlands LSC, based in Leicester, although the local LSC office was based nearby on Kingsley Road in North Hykeham.

===Principals===
* Geoffrey Church, from the early 1960s until 1981
* In around October 1988, the college principal 53-year-old Arthur Ridings, of Southrey, became Director of Education for Lincolnshire. Fred Rickard had left in May 1985 as the county Director of Education, being replaced by Derek Esp, former deputy director for Somerset, who retired in March 1988, being briefly replaced by his deputy David Chrisp, of Wellingore. Mr Ridings had been principal of Beeston College of Further Education from 1973, then principal of Lincoln College of Technology for five years from 1981, then headed the team that former North Lincolnshire College. He attended Leigh Grammar School, in Lancashire where he was the county triple jump champion, and studied Maths and Physics at the University of Nottingham, where he captained the athletics team, and played rugby for the university and the English Universities team. Mr Ridings left the county council at the end of April 1994, to help launch the new University College of Lincolnshire, with Nottingham Trent University. The new university was planned to become independent in 2000, with around 5000 students. He moved to Spridlington in 1994, when at the time his wife was head of the college in Louth. Arthur Ridings was replaced as county director of education in 1994 by Norman Riches, who stayed until March 2000.

==Buildings==

Eight different buildings make up Lincoln College&#x27;s main site, including the Abbey, Gibney, Sessions, Bishops and Cathedral Buildings. Bishops Building, located to the back of the site, contains a technology school. This has electronics courses including BTEC National Diploma Electrical and Electronic Engineering course. Art and Creative course are housed in a building off campus on Christ Hospital Terrace under the same name as the street.

===City of Lincoln School===
Part of the college, the Gibney Building, is the site of the former City School, previously the Lincoln Technical School, which for a time became the headquarters of the Lincoln Archaeological Trust in the early 1970s.

From November 1940, boys from the Bablake School in Coventry were evacuated to the City of Lincoln School for two and a half years. Girls from Bablake School were evacuated to South Park High School for Girls (now Priory LSST). Roundhay Grammar School had been evacuated to Lincoln School (now LCHS) on Wragby Road.

The school had around 600 boys in the 1960s. Former members of this school have their City School Lincoln Association.

==Curriculum==
The automotive technology program at Lincoln College includes training in fuel systems, electrical systems, driving diagnostics and transmissions, and techniques to install, repair and maintain vehicles. There are higher education courses in Computing Higher National Diplomas in Internet and Computer Science &amp; NVQ in Logistics Operations Management.

<text>Hanover Square in downtown Syracuse is actually a triangle at the intersection of Warren, Water, and East Genesee Streets. The name may also refer to the larger Hanover Square Historic District which includes seventeen historic buildings in the area that was the first commercial district in Syracuse. In the warm weather months, entertainment is common on the plaza around the fountain. Workers in the surrounding office buildings and retail establishments often lunch there.

== History ==

When Syracuse was still a village, the village well was located in Hanover Square. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976, the square is an intact, mainly nineteenth century historic district. The buildings on Water Street were backed by the Erie Canal, and were known as “double-enders.” This facilitated the unloading of goods from barges on the canal. Civil War recruiting booths were set up in the square, and were made into a huge bonfire at the end of the war.

== Hanover Square Historic District contributing Properties ==

The 17 properties can be visited in order, starting at South Salina Street and Water Street, going east on Water Street, turning south on Warren Street, and returning on the diagonal along East Genesee Street to Water.

== Today ==
In addition to modern businesses, eateries and stores, loft-style apartments have been created on the upper floors of some of Hanover Square&#x27;s historic buildings.

The 23-floor State Tower Building overlooking the square hosts offices and is a major telecommunications hub for downtown Syracuse.

<doc id="1131913" wikidata="Q4708420" url="?curid=1131913" title="Alasdair Alpin MacGregor">
<text>Alasdair Alpin MacGregor (March 20, 1899 – April 15, 1970) was a Scottish writer, animal welfare campaigner and photographer, known for a large number of travel books. He wrote also on Scottish folklore, and was a published poet.

==Biography==

MacGregor was born at Applecross, Ross and Cromarty, on 20 March 1899, the son of Colonel John MacGregor M.D. of the Indian Medical Service. He was educated at Tain Academy in Inverness, George Watson&#x27;s College and Edinburgh University. He took an arts degree at Edinburgh University. During World War I he served with the 15th Scottish Division in the trenches in France. He was a writer for the magazine &quot;Country Life&quot; and was a correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; for the evacuation of St Kilda in 1930.

He spent much of his life as a freelance photographer and writer of Scotland. His books were mainly about Hebrides and Western Isles. His romanticising style incurred the displeasure of Compton Mackenzie, who caricatured him in some of his novels. Judging by the title of the 1931 book &quot;A Last Voyage to St. Kilda. Being the Observations and Adventures of an Egotistic Private Secretary who was alleged to have been &#x27;warned off&#x27; That Island by Admiralty Officials when attempting to emulate Robinson Crusoe at the Time of Its Evacuation&quot; there might have been something to caricature. In partial explanation, St Kilda was evacuated in 1930; at the time he was Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The same book was the subject of a legal case when MacGregor brought an injunction to prevent the distribution of &quot;The Edge of the World&quot;, a film by Michael Powell that he claimed was based on it. MacGregor lost the case.

He lived in London for most of his adult life in Swan Court and Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. Along with T. Ratcliffe Barnett, an Edinburgh minister and author, MacGregor reflects a transitional period during the first half of the 20th century when the north of Scotland was still rural and mostly unaffected by modern society.

In the years before his death in 1970, he visited the United States often and was a mentor to a young Marion Barry, who later became mayor of Washington, D.C.

His book about his childhood, &quot;The Goat Wife&quot;, tells the evocative story of his hard working and resourceful Aunt Dorothy, who left a comfortable existence in Edinburgh&#x27;s Ann Street - reputed to be the most haunted street in Edinburgh - to begin life as a solo crofter in the Easter Ross village of Ardgay (then known locally as &quot;High Wind&quot;). Spanning the period before the First World War until the end of the Second, it captures the last remnants of the simplicity, privations and charm of Scottish rural community life. The &quot;Victor&quot; in the book is the poet Frederick Victor Branford.

MacGregor was described as a &quot;vegetarian, teetotaller, and uncompromising and active anti-vivisectionist&quot;.

==&quot;The Western Isles&quot;==

MacGregor caused controversy with his book &quot;The Western Isles&quot; (1949) which accused modern islanders of being drunkards, greedy, lazy and immoral. In November, 1949 complaints were sent to the publisher requesting for the book to be withdrawn. James S. Grant editor of the &quot;Stornoway Gazette&quot; denounced the statements in the book as &quot;vile and false&quot;. MacGregor had claimed that his book was based on facts and dared anyone to question them. In response, Grant challenged MacGregor to produce evidence in support of his statements. Grant commented that &quot;this is a matter which affects the good name of the whole Highlands&quot;.

In 1949, The Lewis Association published a booklet titled &quot;The Western Isles: A Critical Analysis of the Book of that Name by Alasdair Alpin MacGregor&quot; to counter the attack on the people of the Hebrides.

==Animal welfare==

MacGregor was a campaigner against cruelty to animals, including vivisection and hunting for sport. In 1929, MacGregor returned his graduation diplomas to Edinburgh University and requested for his name to be erased from the alumni register in protest of the University&#x27;s vivisection activities. In 1930, MacGregor challenged Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer to a public debate on the ethics of vivisection.

MacGregor was president of the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports. He resigned in 1934. He was a vegetarian who argued that animal-lovers should not eat meat. MacGregor attended meetings of the National Equine Defence League. 

===Dispute with the RSPCA===

MacGregor criticized the RSPCA for its non-opposition to blood sports such as fox-hunting. The RSPCA had refused to oppose hunting out of risk of losing its wealthiest supporters. Macgregor alleged that the governing body of the RSPCA had introduced a secret expulsion from their society where &quot;undesirable&quot; members could be expelled.

He was involved in a feud with Robert Gower and in July 1931 they were both involved in an incident at the annual meeting of the RSPCA. MacGregor filed a charge of assault against Gower. MacGregor alleged that Gower the chairman of the meeting ordered six uniformed attendants under his control to remove him from the hall with far more force than was necessary and that he was assaulted in the process whilst Gower made no attempt to stop it. According to MacGregor the attendants attacked him from behind, held him by the throat and hurled him out of the hall. The magistrate dismissed the summons brought by MacGregor against Gower. It was agreed that a considerable amount of force had been used to eject MacGegor from the hall but there was no suggestion that Sir Robert had assaulted MacGregor personally.

==Death==

MacGregor died on April 15, 1970 in London. Following his wishes, his photographic collection and published works were donated to the National Museums by his widow in 1970. His personal papers are stored by the National Library of Scotland.

<text>Stephen Tall was the most common pseudonym of American science fiction writer Compton Newby Crook (June 14, 1908 – January 15, 1981).

==Biography==
Born in Rossville, Tennessee, Crook studied biology at Peabody College, and did graduate work at Arizona State University and Johns Hopkins University. He began teaching biology at Towson University in 1939, where he remained until his retirement in 1973. He was married to writer Beverly Crook and had three children with her. He died in Phoenix, Maryland.

Crook&#x27;s first published story was a winner in the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s first short story writing contest. He began publishing science fiction in 1955 with the appearance of &quot;The Lights on Precipice Peak&quot; in &quot;Galaxy&quot;. His short story &quot;The Bear with the Knot on His Tail&quot; (1971) was nominated for the 1972 Hugo Award for short fiction. His activity in the field grew in the mid-1970s before his death.

In 1983, the Compton Crook/Stephen Tall Memorial Award was established by the Baltimore Science Fiction Society in his name for best first science fiction novel in a given year.

<text>Acampe, abbreviated as Acp in horticultural trade, is a genus of monopodial, epiphytic vandaceous species of orchids, distributed from tropical Asia from India, eastwards to China and southwards to Malaysia, and the Philippines as well as from tropical Africa, Madagascar and islands of the Indian Ocean. The name &quot;Acampe&quot; was derived from the Greek word &quot;akampas&quot;, meaning &quot;rigid&quot;, referring to the small, brittle, inflexible flowers.

&quot;Acampe&quot; produce slow-growing, medium-sized vines that form very large vegetative masses in nature. They are noted for their thick, leathery, leaves. They produce fragrant small to medium-sized yellow flowers, barred with orange or red stripes, in a few to many-flowered racemose inflorescence. The brittle sepals and petals look alike. The ear-shaped, fringed, white labellum (lip) is (sac-shaped) or has a spur, and has red markings at its base. The fleshy column is short and has two waxy pollinia.

Due to their large size and small flowers, they are rarely cultivated.

==Species==
Eight species are recognized as of May 2014:

# &quot;Acampe carinata&quot; - China, India, Assam, Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam 
# &quot;Acampe cephalotes&quot; - Assam, Bangladesh
# &quot;Acampe hulae&quot; - Laos, Cambodia
# &quot;Acampe joiceyana&quot; - Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam
# &quot;Acampe ochracea&quot; - Yunnan, Assam, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam 
# &quot;Acampe pachyglossa&quot; - Africa from Somalia to South Africa; Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles, Réunion, Aldabra 
# &quot;Acampe praemorsa&quot; - India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar
# &quot;Acampe rigida&quot; - China, India, Assam, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaya, Philippines

&quot;Acampe&quot; forms a few intergeneric hybrids :
* × &quot;Aracampe &quot; (&quot;Acampe&quot; × &quot;Arachnis&quot;)
* × &quot;Vancampe&quot; (&quot;Acampe&quot; × &quot;Vanda&quot;)

<text>Vivo (Portuguese for &#x27;Live&#x27;, as in Live Broadcasting, or &#x27;Alive&#x27;), known as Vivo Brazil, is a brand of Telefônica Brasil, a subsidiary of Telefónica and the largest telecommunications company in Brazil. It is headquartered in the Brooklin Novo neighborhood of São Paulo.

==History==
The company was originally formed as part of Telebrás, the state-owned telecom monopoly at the time. In 1998, Telebrás was demerged and privatized. Telefónica bought Telesp, the São Paulo division, and rebranded it to Telefónica. On 15 April 2012, all Telefónica services were rebranded again to Vivo, using the same strategy of unifying all its services in a unique brand, like Movistar (Hispanic America and Spain) and O2 (rest of Europe).

===Merged companies===

The following operators merged to form Vivo:

Owned by Telefónica
*Telefónica Celular (Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul)
*Telebahia Celular (Bahia)
*Telergipe Celular (Sergipe)
*Telesp Landline (São Paulo)

Owned by Portugal Telecom
*Telesp Celular (São Paulo)
*Global Telecom (Paraná, Santa Catarina)
*Norte Brasil Telecom (a.k.a. NBT) (Amazonas, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Maranhão)

Acquired by the joint venture
*TCO Celular (Goiás, the Federal District, Acre, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul)
*Telemig Celular (Minas Gerais)

New operations in the Northeast region
*Vivo (Ceará, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Piauí), since October 2008.
===Vivo brand===

The Vivo brand was launched on 13 April 2003, as a mobile phone service provider. It&#x27;s the largest provider in Brazil with over 76 million users. It originated from the merger of several Brazilian mobile phone operations under a joint-venture owned equally by Portugal Telecom (PT) and Spain&#x27;s Telefónica. Until 2006, the group was composed of six holding companies which, as announced in November 2005, merged into a single holding company, &quot;Vivo Participações&quot;. The operation was concluded on 22 February 2006. In July 2010, Telefónica bought PT&#x27;s shares.

Today Vivo operates an UMTS, 3G networks and bands 1, 7, 3, 28 4G LTE in most Brazilian cities. Initially, the network was based on analog AMPS (IS-95) and parts (resulting from acquisition of other companies), using TDMA (IS-136). These were all converted to GSM beginning in 2006, when, after years being the only CDMA network. For some years, GSM and CDMA networks coexisted. In the second half of the 2000s, the CDMA network was gradually converted to CDMA2000 in the major cities. The CDMA network was discontinued in November 2012.

In 2012, the fixed services in the state of São Paulo were rebranded from Telefónica to Vivo, unifying the brands for fixed and mobile services since then.

<doc id="1131926" wikidata="Q532647" url="?curid=1131926" title="Louie Gohmert">
<text>Louis Buller Gohmert Jr. (; born August 18, 1953) is an American attorney, politician, and former judge who was the U.S. representative from Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 2005 to 2023. Gohmert is a Republican and was part of the Tea Party movement. In January 2015, he unsuccessfully challenged John Boehner for Speaker of the House of Representatives. In November 2021, he announced his candidacy in the 2022 Texas Attorney General election. He failed to advance to the Republican primary runoff, finishing fourth with 17% of the vote. His political positions are often considered far-right.

==Early life and education==
Gohmert was born in Pittsburg, Texas, the son of German Texan architect Louis Buller Gohmert and his first wife Erma Sue (née Brooks). He was raised in Mount Pleasant, Texas, where he graduated from Mount Pleasant High School in 1971.

Gohmert enrolled in Texas A&amp;M University, receiving a U.S. Army scholarship and earning a B.A. in history in 1975. He commanded a cadet brigade in the Corps of Cadets and served as class president. He was also a student leader for the MSC Student Conference on National Affairs alongside future U.S. Representative Chet Edwards, and a member of the Ross Volunteer Company.

Gohmert received a Juris Doctor degree from Baylor Law School in 1977.

==Early political career==
Gohmert attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps. He served in the JAG Corps at Fort Benning, Georgia, from 1978 to 1982. Most of his legal service in the U.S. Army was as a defense attorney.

Gohmert was elected as a state district judge for Texas&#x27;s 7th Judicial District, serving Smith County (Tyler, Texas) from 1992 to 2002. He was elected to three terms. He first saw national recognition for a 1996 probation requirement where he ordered an HIV-positive man, who was convicted on motor vehicle theft charges, to seek the written consent from all future sexual partners on a court-provided form notifying them of his HIV status. The order angered LGBT activists and civil libertarians.

In 2002, Texas Governor Rick Perry appointed Gohmert to fill a vacancy as Chief Justice on Texas&#x27;s 12th Court of Appeals, where he served a six-month term that ended in 2003.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
A mid-decade redistricting made the 1st District significantly more conservative than its predecessor. Tyler, which had long anchored the 4th District, was shifted to the 1st District. In the 2004 Republican primary, Gohmert defeated State Representative Wayne Christian of Center, Texas. He defeated Democratic incumbent 1st District Congressman Max Sandlin with 61% of the vote. He has never again faced another contest that close, and been reelected seven times, never with less than 68% of the vote. He only faced an independent in 2008, and a Libertarian in 2010.

On July 29, 2009, Gohmert signed on as a co-sponsor of the defeated H.R. 1503. This bill would have amended &quot;the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the principal campaign committee of a candidate for election to the office of president to include with the committee&#x27;s statement of organization a copy of the candidate&#x27;s birth certificate, together with such other documentation as may be necessary to establish that the candidate meets the qualifications for eligibility to the office of president under the Constitution&quot;.

On January 3, 2013, Gohmert broke ranks with the House leadership to nominate Representative Allen West for Speaker of the House, although West narrowly lost his bid for reelection in 2012 and was no longer a member of Congress.

Although Gohmert had previously ruled out the possibility of a bid for the U.S. Senate, in 2013 he was boosted by at least one &quot;tea party&quot; group (Grassroots America We the People) as a primary challenger to Senator John Cornyn.

A vocal critic of Speaker John Boehner, Gohmert challenged his reelection to the speakership for the 114th Congress when Congress convened on January 6, 2015. Boehner was reelected, even though 25 Freedom Caucus Republicans chose not to vote for him. Gohmert received three of those votes.

In 2017, Gohmert expressed fear that he might become the target of gun violence similar to that experienced by former representative Gabby Giffords and refused to hold public town hall meetings.

During his nine terms in office, Gohmert passed one bill that would become a law, a 2017 measure simplifying the 9-1-1 system.

=== Reputation ===
Gohmert is considered to be a conservative Tea Party Republican.

During his congressional career, Gohmert&#x27;s actions and comments garnered much controversy, including when he compared homosexuality to bestiality, compared U.S. President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler, said Hillary Clinton was &quot;mentally challenged,&quot; speculated mask wearing caused his contraction of COVID-19, grieved over the arrest of January 6 rioters, and said cancelling a television show with homophobic comments was comparable to Nazism. Eric Neugeboren of &quot;The Texas Tribune&quot; described Gohmert as &quot;something of an outlier in Congress for the ease with which he was willing to make unfounded and offensive pronouncements&quot; and that he &quot;was a precursor to former President Donald Trump&#x27;s brand of populist, establishment-bucking conservatism that delights in offending progressives and makes no apologies for spreading misinformation.&quot; According to &quot;The Daily Sentinel&quot;, while Gohmert was seen nationally as &quot;unhinged,&quot; he remained very popular with his constituents.

In May 2021, Gohmert made a rambling speech in which he admitted that many people think he is &quot;the dumbest guy in Congress;&quot; though, he added &quot;I&#x27;m comfortable with who and what I am.&quot; The speech resulted in mockery of Gohmert by some in the media.

=== Fiscal policy ===
Gohmert signed the Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He offered an alternative plan to kick-start the economy with his tax holiday bill, which would allow taxpayers to be exempt for two months from having federal income tax taken out of their paychecks.

He was one of a number of Republicans who voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011 on grounds it did not do enough to deal with the government&#x27;s growing debt.

Gohmert was one of four Republicans who joined 161 Democrats to vote against a balanced budget Constitutional amendment in November 2011.

Gohmert supports and has voted for legislation in favor of school vouchers.

Gohmert strongly supported the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress), a bill that would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in the Congressional Budget Office&#x27;s baseline. Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year&#x27;s appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation. Gohmert said, &quot;conservatives have advocated for years that there should be no automatic spending increases in any federal department&#x27;s budget ... that has been a trap so when we simply slow the rate of increase, we are accused of making draconian cuts.&quot; He argued the legislation would make clearer &quot;what is an increase and what is a cut&quot;, put the government in the same situation as American families, and help with the task of getting the debt under control.

=== Climate change and the environment ===
Gohmert rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and has asserted that data supporting it is fraudulent. He opposes cap-and-trade legislation, such as the one that passed the U.S. House when it had a Democratic majority, and supports expanding drilling and exploration in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

In a July 8, 2015, interview on the C-SPAN program &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, after Pope Francis issued his second encyclical &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;, Gohmert said Francis was incorrect to identify climate change as a serious problem. He supported the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.

In a 2012 meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee, Gohmert stated his strong support of a trans-Alaskan pipeline as a means for caribou to have more sex. According to Gohmert, &quot;When [the caribou] want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline. So [my] real concern now [is] ... if oil stops running through the pipeline ... do we need a study to see how adversely the caribou would be affected if that warm oil ever quit flowing?&quot; Gohmert&#x27;s comments were not favorably received by the rest of the committee.

During a June 2021 House Natural Resources Committee hearing, Gohmert asked, &quot;is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM (Bureau of Land Management) can do to change the course of the moon&#x27;s orbit or the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the sun?&quot; to mitigate climate change. Though some assumed he was being ironic, after receiving laughter and scorn for his comments online, Gohmert mistakenly believed that the scorn directed at him was due to the acronym &quot;BLM&quot; (as if people were confusing it with Black Lives Matter), and replied, &quot;Exceedingly devious how you hid the context with an ellipses in your tweet. The hearing was about the BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT &amp; climate change. BLM stands for the BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT&quot;, failing to realize people were laughing at him for asking his question seriously. &quot;Scientific American&quot; pointed out the practical and theoretical problems involved in Gohmert&#x27;s proposal.

=== Abortion ===

Gohmert opposes abortion. He has said that he believes that life begins at conception. Gohmert sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act and voted for the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, a bill that prohibits the transportation of a minor across state lines for the purposes of an abortion without their parents&#x27; consent. He has a 100% pro-life voting record rating from the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC).

At a congressional hearing on May 23, 2013, on an abortion bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Gohmert told the story of a couple he knew who decided to go through with their pregnancy despite learning of fetal anomalies. He told Zink, a witness, that she should have gone through with her pregnancy despite a doctor&#x27;s opinion that the brain function was impaired, and then have a better assessment of the baby&#x27;s health once it was born. Gohmert said, &quot;Ms. Zink, having my great sympathy and empathy both, I still come back wondering, shouldn&#x27;t we wait, like that couple did, and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart? ... So these are ethical issues, they&#x27;re moral issues, they&#x27;re difficult issues, and the parents should certainly be consulted. But it just seems like it&#x27;s a more educated decision if the child is in front of you to make those decisions&quot;.

=== LGBT rights ===
Gohmert opposes LGBT rights. In 2009, he voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a bill that expanded federal hate crime law to cover crimes biased by the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2010, Gohmert opposed allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the U.S. military and voted against the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act. In 2015, Gohmert cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Gohmert also cosponsored a resolution disagreeing with the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which held that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional. In 2019, he expressed strong opposition to the Equality Act, a bill that would protect LGBT people against discrimination.

=== School shootings ===
On December 16, 2012, two days after the Sandy Hook shootings, Gohmert appeared on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; and suggested that the tragedy would have never happened had the teachers been armed. He told host Chris Wallace: &quot;I wish to God that she [principal Dawn L. Hochsprung] had an M4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out... and takes him out and takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids.&quot; He claimed that the 20 victims who had been killed with a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle had &quot;defensive wounds&quot;.

After the 2022 Uvalde school massacre, Gohmert said, &quot;Maybe if we heard more prayers from leaders of this country instead of taking God&#x27;s name in vain, we wouldn&#x27;t have the mass killings like we didn&#x27;t have before prayer was eliminated from schools.&quot;

=== Scientific research funding ===
On March 22, 2016, Gohmert was one of four representatives to vote against H.R. 4742 (383 voted for it), a bill to authorize the National Science Foundation to support entrepreneurial programs for women. He said the following in defense of his position: he acknowledged the bill was &quot;well-intentioned&quot; but said &quot;this program is designed to discriminate against that young, poverty-stricken boy and to encourage the girl. Forget the boy. Encourage the girl.&quot;

=== Hate crimes ===
On February 26, 2020, Gohmert voted against making lynching a federal hate crime. He said the 10-year sentence for lynching in the act was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and that crimes such as lynching should be prosecuted through state murder statutes, which is punishable up to death in Texas. Gohmert opposes federal hate crime legislation, saying that some hate crime legislation is unnecessary because assault and murder are already crimes.

===Foreign policy and national security===
On May 15, 2013, Gohmert said in a House Judiciary Hearing that he believed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not act with due diligence concerning alleged bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. His contention was that the FBI was more interested in Christian groups such as those led by Billy and Franklin Graham than in groups that might be considered less politically correct to target. Attorney General Eric Holder responded to his claims: &quot;The only observation I was going to make is that you state as a matter of fact what the FBI did and did not do. Unless somebody has done something inappropriate, you don&#x27;t have access to the FBI files ... I know what the FBI did. You cannot know what I know. That&#x27;s all&quot;. Gohmert objected to this on the grounds that Holder had &quot;challenge[d]&quot; his character and made several unsuccessful attempts to inject his viewpoint as a point of personal privilege.

In April 2018, Gohmert testified at a hearing supporting Derrick Miller, a former US Army National Guardsman Sergeant who was sentenced to life in prison with the chance of parole for the premeditated murder of an Afghan civilian during a battlefield interrogation.

In September 2021, Gohmert was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.

Gohmert was among 19 House Republicans to vote against the final passage of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.

In June 2021, Gohmert was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.

====&quot;Terror babies&quot;====
In a speech about national security on the House floor in June 2010, Gohmert claimed that a retired FBI agent had told him that one of the things the FBI had been looking at were terrorist cells overseas sending young women to become pregnant so they would deliver the baby in the United States, and then take the baby with them back to be raised as a terrorist. When adult, this operative—a U.S. citizen by birth—could be easily infiltrated in the U.S. to carry out terrorist actions. On August 12, 2010, Gohmert appeared on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; to defend comments he had recently made on the House floor about &quot;terror babies&quot;.

On Fox Business, Gohmert later claimed that an airline passenger with a relative in Hamas had a grandchild who was to be intentionally born in the United States. In the interview, he said that pregnant women from the Middle East were traveling to the U.S. on tourist visas, planning to deliver children there.

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that children born on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens at birth. Gohmert asserted that the children would then be returned to the mothers&#x27; home countries and undergo terrorist training. When repeatedly asked by the host for evidence of this, Gohmert did not provide substantiation for either the ex-FBI agent story or the airline passenger story, but he did refer to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article that said Chinese tourists sometimes travel to the U.S. to give birth in the U.S. Gohmert said this practice takes advantage of a &quot;gaping hole in the security of our country&quot;.

====Muslim Brotherhood====
On June 13, 2012, Gohmert was one of five Republican United States representatives (with Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Tom Rooney, and Lynn Westmoreland) to send letters to the Inspectors General of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State outlining their &quot;serious national security concerns&quot; and asking for &quot;answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical groups&#x27; access to top Obama administration officials.&quot; In the letter, the lawmakers wrote about information they claimed &quot;raises serious questions about Department of State policies and activities that appear to be a result of influence operations conducted by individuals and organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.&quot;

A letter to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, mentioned the Deputy Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin, wife of former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, who had access to sensitive national security and policy information, &quot;has three family members—her late father, her mother and her brother—connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations&quot;, as backed up by a study by the Center for Security Policy.

The letter and the Center for Security Policy&#x27;s accusation were widely denounced as a smear, and achieved &quot;near-universal condemnation&quot;, including from several prominent Republicans such as John McCain, John Boehner, Scott Brown, and Marco Rubio.

Newt Gingrich praised Gohmert and his colleagues as the &quot;National Security Five&quot; in a &quot;Politico&quot; editorial. Gingrich wrote that he favored investigating the Muslim Brotherhood, and made clear his support for Gohmert and the other four representatives for raising concerns that improve national security. Conservative columnist Cal Thomas replied, to accusations of &quot;McCarthyism&quot;, that the real possibility of infiltration by Islamic extremists deserves to be investigated.

===Immigration===
In November 2007, Gohmert introduced private relief bill, H.R. 4070, which would have stalled the deportation of an Albanian restaurateur from Gohmert&#x27;s district who had fled to the United States in January 2001 after his brother witnessed the murder of a leading member of the Democratic Party of Albania.

Gohmert voted against the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes.

Gohmert voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

Gohmert voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

In early 2018, Gohmert announced that he had introduced a resolution (H. Res. 791) to change the name of Cesar Chavez Day to Border Control Day, saying, &quot;Chavez spent his life addressing the harmful effects that illegal migration might have on this country and advocating for a legal immigration process.&quot; The proposition was criticized by Arizona House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios and members of the Hispanic-American community, who felt it was disrespectful of Chavez&#x27;s legacy.

In December 2018, with the possibility of a government shutdown looming, the House passed a bill funding the government through February and providing $5.7 billion for the border wall between the United States and Mexico favored by President Trump hours after he told House Republican leaders that he would not sign a package passed in the Senate because it did not provide money for the barrier. After the shutdown commenced, Griff Jenkins asked Gohmert how long Trump should keep the government closed. Gohmert said that only a fourth of the government was shut down as Congress had already approved other portions of the funding through September 2019 and answered that Trump should keep it closed &quot;till hell freezes over&quot; as Congress owed Americans border security. He added that the most compassionate thing the US could do for Mexico and Central America was to not give either country &quot;money that ends up in the hands of drug cartels.&quot; In a later statement, Gohmert said, &quot;It is simply outrageous that people who live behind walls, gated communities, have armed body guards and lead the Democrat Party, like millionaire Speaker Pelosi, would deny the American public the simple right to be safe from dangerous criminal elements included in the groups pouring illegally into our country.&quot;

===Comments on George Soros===
In December 2018, Gohmert was a guest on &quot;Varney &amp; Co.&quot;, on Fox Business discussing Google&#x27;s work in China, when he digressed to say that it reminded him that &quot;George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it from the damage he&#x27;s inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned. This same kind of thing—Google coming from a free country and helping oppress.&quot; The allegation was criticized by NBC News for allegedly denigrating Soros&#x27;s surviving the Holocaust.

Within an hour, host Stuart Varney said on air, &quot;In the last hour, one of our guests, Congressman Louie Gohmert, for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros, and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business.&quot; Gohmert later responded that his words had not been anti-Jewish and were actually a &quot;pro-Jewish statement on my part.&quot;

=== Investigations into Donald Trump===
====Call for Robert Mueller to resign====
Gohmert was one of three Republicans who called for the resignation of Robert Mueller, the prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, on the grounds that they believed Mueller could not conduct his investigation fairly &quot;because of his relationship with James Comey, his successor at the bureau&quot;. As of March 2016, &quot;[s]ix people connected to President Trump have been charged by the special counsel with an array of crimes, including financial fraud and lying to Congress and investigators. Five have been convicted or pleaded guilty. Twenty-eight others, including 26 Russians, also face charges.&quot; Mueller did not exonerate Trump on the issue of obstruction, a fact he reiterated during the House Judiciary Committee hearing. In a June 2019 interview with Politico, Gohmert called Mueller an &quot;anal opening.&quot;

====Whistleblower outing====
In an open impeachment hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Gohmert spoke the name of a man widely thought to be the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the first impeachment of Donald Trump.

===COVID-19===
Although there is no evidence of its effectiveness, Gohmert strongly supports the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, as he told Sean Hannity of Fox News in July 2020. He urged the Food and Drug Administration in April 2020 to approve the drug as an official treatment. In April 2020, Gohmert was criticized after falsely claiming that Germany had invented a &quot;mist&quot; that killed the coronavirus.

Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19 on July 29, 2020, a day after he attended a House Judiciary Committee hearing without wearing a mask, a practice he had largely maintained for some time. In an interview, he suggested that he might have contracted the disease from wearing a mask. An anonymous Gohmert aide emailed &quot;Politico&quot; with complaints, thanking &quot;Politico&quot; for letting the office know Gohmert tested positive; that &quot;Louie requires full staff to be in the office, including three interns, so that &#x27;we could be an example to America on how to open up safely&#x27;&quot;; and that &quot;people were often berated for wearing a mask&quot;. Gohmert said he planned to take hydroxychloroquine as part of his treatment. On September 19, he was reported to be &quot;glad to be on the other side&quot; and to have donated his blood plasma (presumably for use in convalescent plasma therapy).

===2020 election and Capitol attack===

In December 2020, Gohmert was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

====&quot;Gohmert v. Pence&quot;====

On December 27, 2020, Gohmert filed a federal lawsuit against Vice President Mike Pence in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, authored by attorney Lawrence J. Joseph, in an attempt to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Gohmert&#x27;s lawsuit alleged that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 was unconstitutional, seeking to grant the Vice President the power to reject state-certified presidential electors in favor of &quot;competing slates of electors&quot;. Gohmert was joined in his lawsuit by 11 Arizona Republicans who would have become presidential electors had Trump actually won Arizona. The United States Department of Justice represented Pence in the case and argued for its dismissal.

On January 1, 2021, Gohmert&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed by federal judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, because the plaintiffs lacked standing. Kernodle ruled that Gohmert lacked standing due to precedent set by the Supreme Court in 1997: alleging an &quot;institutional injury to the House of Representatives&quot; does not grant Gohmert standing to sue. Additionally, Kernodle ruled that the injury Gohmert was alleging depended on so many hypothetical and not yet realized events that it was &quot;far too uncertain to support standing&quot;. Gohmert failed to make a case for how he was injured &quot;as an individual&quot;, Kernodle said. As for the other plaintiffs, Kernodle ruled that they lacked standing because the injury they alleged was &quot;not fairly traceable&quot; to Pence.

Gohmert appealed the district court&#x27;s ruling that day. He also reacted to the dismissal by declaring that with &quot;no remedy&quot; provided, &quot;in effect the ruling would be that you gotta go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and BLM.&quot;

On January 2, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit speedily and tersely rejected Gohmert&#x27;s appeal; they &quot;affirm the judgment&quot; of the district court, &quot;essentially for the reasons stated by the district court&quot;. The judges who presided over the appeal were Andrew Oldham (appointed by Trump), Patrick Higginbotham and Jerry Edwin Smith (both appointed by Ronald Reagan).

Gohmert then appealed to the Supreme Court; the Court rejected the petition on January 7.

====January 6 Capitol attack====

According to a U.S. Capitol Police intelligence assessment, during a Newsmax interview on January 1, 2021, &quot;Gohmert claimed that letting the will of the voters stand would &#x27;mean the end of our republic, the end of the experiment in self-government&#x27;&quot; and &quot;then seemed to encourage violence as a means to this end.&quot; The assessment quoted Gohmert saying, in part, &quot;you gotta go to the streets and be as violent as antifa and BLM.&quot; Gohmert denied he had advocated violence.

Gohmert was one of the 147 members of Congress to vote against certifying the results of the 2020 Electoral College in Congress on January 7, 2021, the day after the Capitol attack.

Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the Trump administration, testified to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack that Gohmert, as well as other lawmakers, requested a pardon from President Trump after the Capitol attack; Gohmert denied asking for a pardon for himself and said the January 6 committee hearings were &quot;become nothing more than a Soviet-style propaganda production.&quot; In June 2021, Gohmert was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

In July 2021, Gohmert suggested the Capitol attack was a conspiracy possibly set up by Democrats. In September 2022, upon the release of convicted January 6 participant Simone Gold from federal prison, he gave Gold an American flag that had flown on the Capitol.

In June 2022, Gohmert said, &quot;if you&#x27;re a Republican, you can&#x27;t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they&#x27;re coming after you&quot;, in response to the indictment of Trump adviser Peter Navarro for non-compliance with the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. In contrast, Gohmert claimed, &quot;If you&#x27;re a Democrat, then you can lie. You can cheat&quot;, referencing the acquittal of lawyer Michael Sussmann.

===Support for impeaching Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas===

Gohmert was one of 32 Republican congress members to cosponsor Andy Biggs&#x27; August 2021 resolution to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. He was also one of six Republican congress members to cosponsor Lauren Boebert&#x27;s September 2021 resolution to impeach President Biden.

== Texas Attorney General candidacy ==

In November 2021, Gohmert announced his candidacy in the 2022 Texas Attorney General election instead of seeking re-election in Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district, to challenge incumbent Ken Paxton in a crowded Republican primary. He made the announcement to run after saying he would join the race if he could reach $1 million in political donations in 10 days. He stated he had reached the goal; however, campaign finance report show Gohmert had not met the $1 million goal. Gohmert ended last in the four-candidate primary.

He was succeeded in his seat in the House by Nathaniel Moran.

<text>Greywacke or graywacke (German &quot;grauwacke&quot;, signifying a grey, earthy rock) is a variety of sandstone generally characterized by its hardness (6–7 on Mohs scale), dark color, and poorly sorted angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and small rock fragments or sand-size lithic fragments set in a compact, clay-fine matrix. It is a texturally immature sedimentary rock generally found in Paleozoic strata. The larger grains can be sand- to gravel-sized, and matrix materials generally constitute more than 15% of the rock by volume.

== Formation ==
The origin of greywacke was unknown until turbidity currents and turbidites were understood, since, according to the normal laws of sedimentation, gravel, sand and mud should not be laid down together. Geologists now attribute its formation to submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents. These actions churn sediment and cause mixed-sediment slurries, in which the resulting deposits may exhibit a variety of sedimentary features. Supporting the turbidity origin theory is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves, at the bottoms of oceanic trenches, and at the bases of mountain formational areas. They also occur in association with black shales of deep-sea origin.

As a rule, greywackes do not contain fossils, but organic remains may be common in the finer beds associated with them. Their component particles are usually not very rounded or polished, and the rocks have often been considerably indurated by recrystallization, such as the introduction of interstitial silica. In some districts, the greywackes are cleaved, but they show phenomena of this kind much less perfectly than the slates.

Although the group is so diverse that it is difficult to characterize mineralogically, it has a well-established place in petrographical classifications because these peculiar composite arenaceous deposits are very frequent among Silurian and Cambrian rocks, and are less common in Mesozoic or Cenozoic strata. Their essential features are their gritty character and their complex composition. By increasing metamorphism, greywackes frequently pass into mica-schists, chloritic schists and sedimentary gneisses.

=== Varieties ===
The term &quot;greywacke&quot; can be confusing, since it can refer to either the immature (rock fragment) aspect of the rock or its fine-grained (clay) component.

Greywackes are mostly grey, brown, yellow, or black, dull-colored sandy rocks that may occur in thick or thin beds along with shales and limestones. Some varieties include &quot;feldspathic greywacke&quot;, rich in feldspar, and &quot;lithic greywacke&quot;, rich in other tiny rock fragments. They can contain a very great variety of minerals, the principal ones being quartz, orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars, calcite, iron oxides and graphitic, carbonaceous matters, together with (in the coarser kinds) fragments of such rocks as felsite, chert, slate, gneiss, various schists, and quartzite. Among other minerals found in them are biotite, chlorite, tourmaline, epidote, apatite, garnet, hornblende, augite, sphene and pyrites. The cementing material may be siliceous or argillaceous and is sometimes calcareous.

== In geology and geography ==

Greywackes are abundant in Wales, the south of Scotland, the Longford-Down Massif in Ireland and the Lake District National Park of England; they compose the majority of the main Southern Alps that make up the backbone of New Zealand. Both feldspathic and lithic greywacke have been recognized in Ecca Group in South Africa. Greywackes are also found in parts of the Eastern Desert east of the Nile.

They were an early object of geological study in Britain where the Geological Society was founded in 1807, and excited much public interest in geology. Greywacke was interesting because it was found in many places in Britain and its occurrence in particular places was evidence of the pattern of geological strata that had been laid down.

==Uses==
Greywacke stone has been used as a building material and a sculptural material across many eras and societies. Its oldest known uses date to the early third millennium BCE, in Egypt&#x27;s early dynastic period. Its wide use in sculpture and vessels is thought to have been due to its fine grain size and resistance to fracturing, making it suitable for fine detail and intricate shapes.

Aside from its structural uses, greywacke stone (or molds taken from it) is valuable to practitioners of traditional motion picture miniature photography, because due to its unusually mixed nature, it remains looking natural when portraying a wide range of miniature scale ratios, from 1:1 to as high as 1:600.

<text>An art exhibition is traditionally the space in which art objects (in the most general sense) meet an audience. The exhibit is universally understood to be for some temporary period unless, as is occasionally true, it is stated to be a &quot;permanent exhibition&quot;. In American English, they may be called &quot;exhibit&quot;, &quot;exposition&quot; (the French word) or &quot;show&quot;. In UK English, they are always called &quot;exhibitions&quot; or &quot;shows&quot;, and an individual item in the show is an &quot;exhibit&quot;.

Such expositions may present pictures, drawings, video, sound, installation, performance, interactive art, new media art or sculptures by individual artists, groups of artists or collections of a specific form of art.

The art works may be presented in museums, art halls, art clubs or private art galleries, or at some place the principal business of which is not the display or sale of art, such as a coffeehouse. An important distinction is noted between those exhibits where some or all of the works are for sale, normally in private art galleries, and those where they are not. Sometimes the event is organized on a specific occasion, like a birthday, anniversary or commemoration.

==Types of exhibitions==
There are different kinds of art exhibitions, in particular there is a distinction between commercial and non-commercial exhibitions. A commercial exhibition or trade fair is often referred to as an art fair that shows the work of artists or art dealers where participants generally have to pay a fee. A vanity gallery is an exhibition space of works in a gallery that charges the artist for use of the space. Temporary museum exhibitions typically display items from the museum&#x27;s own collection on a particular period, theme or topic, supplemented by loans from other collections, mostly those of other museums. They normally include no items for sale; they are distinguished from the museum&#x27;s permanent displays, and most large museums set aside a space for temporary exhibitions.

Exhibitions in commercial galleries are often entirely made up of items that are for sale, but may be supplemented by other items that are not. Typically, the visitor has to pay (extra on top of the basic museum entrance cost) to enter a museum exhibition, but not a commercial one in a gallery. Retrospectives look back over the work of a single artist; other common types are individual exhibitions or &quot;solo shows&quot;, and group exhibitions or &quot;group shows&quot;). The Biennale is a large exhibition held every two years, often intending to gather together the best of international art; there are now many of these. A travelling exhibition is an exhibition seen at several venues, sometimes across the world.

Exhibitions of new or recent art can be juried, invitational, or open. 
* A juried exhibition, such as the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London, or the Iowa Biennial, has an individual (or group) acting as judge of the submitted artworks, selecting which are to be shown. If prizes are to be awarded, the judge or panel of judges will usually select the prizewinners as well.
* In an invitational exhibition, such as the Whitney Biennial, the organizer of the show asks certain artists to supply artworks and exhibits them.
* An open or &quot;non-juried&quot; exhibition, such as the Kyoto Triennial, allows anybody to enter artworks and shows them all. A type of exhibition that is usually non-juried is a mail art exhibition. 

* A pop-up art exhibition is a temporary showcase of artwork that takes place in unconventional or unexpected locations. It offers a unique and immersive art experience outside of traditional gallery settings, often appearing spontaneously and capturing the attention of diverse audiences.

==History==

The art exhibition has played a crucial part in the market for new art since the 18th and 19th centuries. The Paris Salon, open to the public from 1737, rapidly became the key factor in determining the reputation, and so the price, of the French artists of the day. The Royal Academy in London, beginning in 1769, soon established a similar grip on the market, and in both countries artists put great efforts into making pictures that would be a success, often changing the direction of their style to meet popular or critical taste. The British Institution was added to the London scene in 1805, holding two annual exhibitions, one of new British art for sale, and one of loans from the collections of its aristocratic patrons. These exhibitions received lengthy and detailed reviews in the press, which were the main vehicle for the art criticism of the day. Critics as distinguished as Denis Diderot and John Ruskin held their readers attention by sharply divergent reviews of different works, praising some extravagantly and giving others the most savage put-downs they could think of. Many of the works were already sold, but success at these exhibitions was a crucial way for an artist to attract more commissions. Among important early one-off loan exhibitions of older paintings were the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, and the Exhibition of National Portraits in London, at what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum, held in three stages in 1866–1868.

As the academic art promoted by the Paris Salon, always more rigid than London, was felt to be stifling French art, alternative exhibitions, now generally known as the Salon des Refusés (&quot;Salon of the Refused&quot;) were held, most famously in 1863, when the government allowed them an annex to the main exhibition for a show that included Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot; &quot;(Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe)&quot; and James McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Girl in White&quot;. This began a period where exhibitions, often one-off shows, were crucial in exposing the public to new developments in art, and eventually Modern art. Important shows of this type were the Armory Show in New York City in 1913 and the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936.

Museums started holding large loan exhibitions of historic art in the late 19th century, as also did the Royal Academy, but the modern &quot;blockbuster&quot; museum exhibition, with long queues and a large illustrated catalogue, is generally agreed to have been introduced by the exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun held in several cities in the 1970s. Many exhibitions, especially in the days before good photographs were available, are important in stimulating research in art history; the exhibition held in Bruges in 1902 (poster illustrated below) had a crucial impact on the study of Early Netherlandish painting.

In 1968, Art fairs in Europe became quite the fashion with the advent of the Cologne Art Fair which was sponsored by the Cologne Art Dealers Association. Because of the high admission standards of the Cologne fair a rival fair was organized in Düsseldorf which enabled less regarded galleries opportunity to meet with an international public. The fairs took place during the fall months. This rivalry continued for a few years which provided the Basel Art Fair the opportunity to interject the Basel fair in early summer. These fairs became extremely important to galleries, dealers and publishers as they provided the possibility of worldwide distribution. Düsseldorf and Cologne merged their efforts. Basel soon became the most important art fair.

In 1976, the Felluss Gallery under the direction of Elias Felluss, in Washington DC organized the first American dealer art fair. &quot;The Washington International Art Fair&quot; or &quot;Wash Art&quot; for brevity. This American fair met with fierce opposition by those galleries interested in maintaining distribution channels for European artwork already in place. The Washington fair introduced the European idea of dealer fairs to art dealers throughout the United States. Following the advent of Wash Art, many fairs developed throughout the United States.

==Preservation issues==
Although preservation issues are often disregarded in favor of other priorities during the exhibition process, they should certainly be considered so that possible damage to the collection is minimized or limited. As all objects in the library exhibition are unique and to some extent vulnerable, it is essential that they be displayed with care. Not all materials are able withstand the hardships of display, and therefore each piece needs to be assessed carefully to determine its ability to withstand the rigors of an exhibition. In particular, when exhibited items are archival artifacts or paper-based objects, preservation considerations need be emphasized because damage and change in such materials is cumulative and irreversible. Two trusted sources – the National Information Standard Organization&#x27;s &quot;Environmental Conditions for Exhibiting Library and Archival Materials,&quot; and the British Library&#x27;s &quot;Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials&quot; – have established indispensable criteria to help curtail the deleterious effects of exhibitions on library and archival materials. These criteria may be divided into five main preservation categories: Environmental concerns of the exhibition space; Length of the exhibition; Individual cases; Display methods used on individual objects; and Security.

===Environmental concerns of the exhibition space===
The main concerns of exhibition environments include light, relative humidity, and temperature.

;Light

Light wavelength, intensity, and duration contribute collectively to the rate of material degradation in exhibitions. The intensity of visible light in the display space should be low enough to avoid object deterioration, but bright enough for viewing. A patron&#x27;s tolerance of low-level illumination can be aided by reducing ambient light levels to a level lower than that falling on the exhibit. Visible light levels should be maintained at between 50 lux and 100 lux depending on the light sensitivity of objects. An items level of toleration will depend on the inks or pigments being exposed and the duration of the exhibition time. A maximum exhibition length should initially be determined for each exhibited item based on its light sensitivity, anticipated light level, and its cumulative past and projected exhibition exposure.

Light levels need to be measured when the exhibition is prepared. UV light meters will check radiation levels in an exhibit space, and data event loggers help determine visible light levels over an extended period of time. Blue wool standards cards can also be utilized to predict the extent to which materials will be damaged during exhibits. UV radiation must be eliminated to the extent it is physically possible; it is recommended that light with a wavelength below 400 nm (ultraviolet radiation) be limited to no more than 75 microwatts per lumen at 10 to 100 lux.Furthermore, exposure to natural light is undesirable because of its intensity and high UV content. When such exposure is unavoidable, preventative measures must be taken to control UV radiation, including the use of blinds, shades, curtains, UV filtering films, and UV-filtering panels in windows or cases. Artificial light sources are safer options for exhibition. Among these sources, incandescent lamps are most suitable because they emit little or no UV radiation. Fluorescent lamps, common in most institutions, may be used only when they produce a low UV output and when covered with plastic sleeves before exhibition. Though tungsten-halogen lamps are currently a favorite artificial lighting source, they still give off significant amounts of UV radiation; use these only with special UV filters and dimmers. Lights should be lowered or turned off completely when visitors are not in the exhibition space.

;Relative humidity (RH)
The exhibition space&#x27;s relative humidity (RH) should be set to a value between 35% and 50%. The maximum acceptable variation should be 5% on either side of this range. Seasonal changes of 5% are also allowed. The control of relative humidity is especially critical for vellum and parchment materials, which are extremely sensitive to changes in relative humidity and may contract violently and unevenly if displayed in too dry an environment.

;Temperature
For preservation purposes, cooler temperatures are always recommended. The temperature of the display space should not exceed 72 °F. A lower temperature of down to 50 °F can be considered safe for a majority of objects. The maximum acceptable variation in this range is 5 °F, meaning that the temperature should not go above 77 °F and below 45 °F. As temperature and relative humidity are interdependent, temperature should be reasonably constant so that relative humidity can be maintained as well. Controlling the environment with 24-hour air conditioning and dehumidification is the most effective way of protecting an exhibition from serious fluctuations.

===Length of the exhibition===

One factor that influences how well materials will fare in an exhibition is the length of the show. The longer an item is exposed to harmful environmental conditions, the more likely that it will experience deterioration. Many museums and libraries have permanent exhibitions, and installed exhibitions have the potential to be on the view without any changes for years.

Damage from a long exhibition is usually caused by light. The degree of deterioration is different for each respective object. For paper-based items, the suggested maximum length of time that they should be on display is three months per year, or 42 kilolux hours of light per year – whichever comes first.

An exhibition log report, including records of the length of the exhibition time and the light level of the display, may prevent objects from being exhibited too frequently. Displayed items need to be inspected regularly for evidence of damage or change. It is recommended that high-quality facsimiles of especially delicate or fragile materials be displayed in lieu of originals for longer exhibitions.

===Individual cases===
Library or archival materials are usually displayed in display cases or frames. Cases provide a physically and chemically secure environment. Vertical cases are acceptable for small or single-sheet items, and horizontal cases can be used for a variety of objects, including three-dimensional items such as opened or closed books, and flat paper items. All these objects can be arranged simultaneously in one horizontal case under a unified theme.

Materials used for case construction should be chosen carefully because component materials can easily become a significant source of pollutants or harmful fumes for displayed objects. Outgassing from materials used in the construction of the exhibition case and/or fabrics used for lining the case can be destructive. Pollutants may cause visible deterioration, including discoloration of surfaces and corrosion. Examples of evaluative criteria to be used in deeming materials suitable for use in exhibit display could be the potential of contact-transfer of harmful substances, water solubility or dry-transfer of dyes, the dry-texture of paints, pH, and abrasiveness.

New cases may be preferred, constructed of safe materials such as metal, plexiglass, or some sealed woods. Separating certain materials from the display section of an exhibition case by lining relevant surfaces with an impermeable barrier film will help protect items from damage. Any fabrics that line or decorate the case (for example, polyester blend fabric), and any adhesives used in the process, should also be tested to determine any risk. Using internal buffers and pollutant absorbers, such as silica gel, activated carbon, or zeolite, is a good way to control relative humidity and pollutants. Buffers and absorbers should be placed out of sight, in the base or behind the backboard of a case. If the case is to be painted, it is recommended oil paints be avoided; acrylic or latex paint is preferable.

===Display methods===
There are two kinds of objects displayed at the library and archival exhibition – bound materials and unbound materials. Bound materials include books and pamphlets, and unbound materials include manuscripts, cards, drawings, and other two-dimensional items. The observance of proper display conditions will help minimize any potential physical damage. All items displayed must be adequately supported and secured.

;Unbound materials
Unbound materials, usually single-sheet items, need to be attached securely to the mounts, unless matted or encapsulated. Metal fasteners, pins, screws, and thumbtacks should not come in direct contact with any exhibit items. Instead, photo corners, polyethylene, or polyester film straps may hold the object to the support. Objects may also be encapsulated in polyester film, though old and untreated acidic papers should be professionally deacidified before encapsulation. Avoid potential slippage during encapsulation – when possible, use ultrasonic or heat seals. For objects that need to be hung (and that may require more protection than lightweight polyester film), matting would be an effective alternative.

Objects in frames should be separated from harmful materials through matting, glazing, and backing layers. Matting, which consists of two pH-neutral or alkaline boards with a window cut in the top board to enable the object to be seen, can be used to support and enhance the display of single sheet or folded items. Backing layers of archival cardboard should be thick enough to protect objects. Moreover, any protective glazing used should never come in direct contact with objects. Frames should be well-sealed and hung securely, allowing a space for air circulation between the frame and the wall.

;Bound materials
The most common way to display bound materials is closed and lying horizontally. If a volume is shown open, the object should be open only as much as its binding allows. Common practice is to open volumes at an angle no greater than 135°. There are some types of equipment that help support volumes as they displayed openly: blocks or wedges, which hold a book cover to reduce stain at the book hinge; cradles, which support bound volumes as they lay open without stress to the binding structure; and polyester film strips, which help to secure open leaves. Textblock supports are best used in conjunction with book cradles where the textblock is greater than 1/2 inch, or where the textblock noticeably sags. Regardless of its method of support, however, any book that is kept open for long periods can cause damage. One should turn an exhibited book&#x27;s pages every few days in order to protect pages from overexposure to light and spread any strain on the binding structure.

===Security===
Because exhibited items are often of special interest, they demand a high level of security to reduce the risk of loss from theft or vandalism. Exhibition cases should be securely locked. In addition, cases may be glazed with a material that hinders penetration and that when broken does not risk shards of glass falling on the exhibits. Whenever possible, the exhibition area should be patrolled; a 24-hour security presence is recommended when precious treasures are exhibited. Finally, the exhibition is best protected when equipped with intruder alarms, which can be fitted at entry points to the building and internal areas.

<doc id="1131937" wikidata="Q1276010" url="?curid=1131937" title="Sylvester (crater)">
<text>Sylvester is a lunar impact crater that is located near the north pole of the Moon, along the northern limb in the libration zone. It lies just to the south-southeast of the craters Grignard and Hermite; the latter of which is within one crater diameter of the pole. South of Sylvester is Pascal. Due to its location, Sylvester receives sunlight at only a low angle.

This crater is generally circular, with a sharp-edged rim that has received only a moderate amount of wear. There are no craters of note along the rim, although Sylvester intrudes into a smaller, shallow-rimmed crater to the southeast. The interior floor is relatively flat, but punctuated by several tiny craters. At the midpoint is a small central peak.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sylvester.

<doc id="1131943" wikidata="Q180073" url="?curid=1131943" title="Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse">
<text>Raymond VII (July 1197 – 27 September 1249) was Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne and Marquis of Provence from 1222 until his death. 
==Family and marriages==
Raymond was born at the Château de Beaucaire, the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Henry II of England and a nephew of kings Richard I and John of England.

In March 1211, at the age of 13, Raymond VII married Sancha of Aragon. They had one daughter, Joan, and were divorced in 1241. He was engaged to Sanchia of Provence, but she married Richard of Cornwall instead. In 1243 Raymond married Margaret of Lusignan, the daughter of Hugh X of Lusignan and Isabella of Angoulême. They had no children and the Council of Lyons in 1245 granted Raymond a divorce. He then tried to get support of Blanche, mother of King Louis IX of France, to marry Beatrice of Provence, who had just become Countess of Provence, but Beatrice married Blanche&#x27;s son Charles instead.

==Life==
During the Albigensian Crusade in May 1216, Raymond set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire, which he captured on 24 August. He fought to reconquer the county of Toulouse from Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simon&#x27;s son Amaury VI of Montfort.

He succeeded his father in 1222. At the moment of his accession, he and the new count of Foix, Roger Bernard II the Great, besieged Carcassonne. On 14 September 1224, the Albigensian Crusaders surrendered and the war came to an end, each southern lord making peace with the church. However, in 1225, the council of Bourges excommunicated him and launched a crusade against him, the king of France, Louis VIII, called &quot;the Lion&quot;, wanting to renew the conflict in order to enforce his royal rights in Languedoc. Roger-Bernard tried to keep the peace, but the king rejected his embassy and the counts of Foix and Toulouse took up arms again. The war was largely a discontinuous series of skirmishes and, in January 1229, Raymond, defeated, was forced to sign the Treaty of Paris (also known as the &quot;Treaty of Meaux&quot;). By this treaty he ceded the former viscounty of Trencavel to Louis IX and his daughter Joan was forced to marry Alphonse, brother of the king.

In 1242, Raymond allied with Count Hugh of La Marche and King Henry III of England against Louis IX during the Saintonge War. Louis sent against him an army under the Constable Imbert de Beaujeu and Bishop Hugh of Clermont. He was forced to surrender the castle of Saverdun and Bram.

When Raymond died, Alphonse became count of Toulouse, and after Alphonse&#x27;s death the county was annexed by France. Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey.

<text>Bicycle infantry are infantry soldiers who maneuver on (or, more often, between) battlefields using military bicycles. The term dates from the late 19th century, when the &quot;safety bicycle&quot; became popular in Europe, the United States, and Australia. Historically, bicycles lessened the need for horses, fuel and vehicle maintenance. Though their use has waned over the years in many armies, they continue to be used in unconventional armies such as militias.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The development of pneumatic tires coupled with shorter, sturdier frames during the late 19th century led to the investigation of possible military uses for bicycles. To some extent, bicyclists took over the functions of dragoons, especially as messengers and scouts, substituting for horses in warfare. Bicycle units or detachments were in existence by the end of the 19th century in most armies. The United Kingdom employed bicycle troops in militia or territorial units, rather than in regular army units. Essentially this reflected the popularity of cycling amongst the civilian population and the perceived value of bicycles in providing increased mobility for home defence units.

In 1887 the first of a series of cyclist maneuvers involving British volunteer units was held. In France, several experimental units were created, starting in 1886. They developed folding bicycles, that could be collapsed and carried slung across the backs of their riders, from an early date. By 1900 each French line infantry and chasseur battalion had a cyclist detachment, intended for skirmishing, scouting and dispatch carrying. In the years prior to World War I the availability of an extensive network of paved or gravel roads in western Europe made military cyclists appear a feasible alternative to horse-mounted troops; on the grounds of economy, simplicity of training, relative silence when on the move and ease of logistical support. The Dutch and Belgian armies, with extensive flat terrain within their national boundaries, maintained battalion or company sized units of cyclists. The Italian Bersaglieri expanded their established role as fast-moving light infantry through the extensive use of bicycles from the 1890s onwards. Even the Swiss Army found bicycles to be a useful means of mobility in rough terrain where horse cavalry could not be used. The Imperial Russian Gendarmerie used bicycles with outrigger wheels, to mount patrols along the Siberian Railway before and during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.(see illustration opposite).

Late in the 19th century the United States Army tested the bicycle&#x27;s suitability for cross-country troop transport. The most extensive experimentation on bicycle units was carried out by 1st Lieutenant James A. Moss, of the 25th United States Infantry (Colored) (an African American infantry regiment with European American officers). Using a variety of cycle models, Moss and his troops, accompanied by an assistant surgeon, carried out extensive bicycle journeys covering between 800 and 1,900 miles (1287 to 3058 km). In 1896, Moss&#x27; Buffalo Soldiers stationed in Montana rode bicycles across roadless landscapes for hundreds of miles at high speed. The &quot;wheelmen&quot; traveled the 1,900 Miles to St. Louis Missouri in 40 days with an average speed of over 6 mph. A proposed ride from Missoula to San Francisco was not approved and the experiments terminated.

The first known use of the bicycle in combat occurred during the 1895 Jameson Raid, in which cyclists carried messages. In the Second Boer War military cyclists were used primarily as scouts and messengers. One unit patrolled railroad lines on specially constructed tandem bicycles that were fitted to the rails. Several raids were conducted by cycle-mounted infantry on both sides; the most famous unit was the &quot;Theron se Verkenningskorps&quot; (Theron Reconnaissance Corps) or TVK, a Boer unit led by the scout Daniel Theron, whom British commander Lord Roberts described as &quot;the hardest thorn in the flesh of the British advance.&quot; Roberts placed a reward of £1,000 on Theron&#x27;s capture and dispatched 4,000 soldiers to find and eliminate the TVK.

=== World Wars ===
During World War I cycle-mounted infantry, scouts, messengers and ambulance carriers were extensively used by all combatants. Italy used bicycles with the &quot;Bersaglieri&quot; (light infantry units) until the end of the war. German Army &quot;Jäger&quot; (light infantry) battalions each had a bicycle company (&quot;Radfahr-Kompanie&quot;) at the outbreak of the war, and additional units were raised during the war, bringing the total to 80 companies. A number of these were formed into eight &quot;Radfahr-Bataillonen&quot; (bicycle battalions). The British Army had cyclist companies in its divisions, and later two whole divisions became cyclists: 1st and 2nd Cyclist Divisions.

Prior to the start of trench warfare the level terrain in Belgium was well used by military cyclists. Each of the four Belgian carabinier battalions included a company of cyclists, equipped with a brand of folding bicycle named the &quot;Belgica&quot;. A regimental cyclist school gave training in map reading, reconnaissance, reporting and the carrying of verbal messages. Attention was paid to the maintenance and repair of the machine itself.

In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops. Early in World War II their southern campaign through Malaya en route to capturing Singapore in 1941 was largely dependent on bicycle-riding soldiers. In both efforts bicycles allowed quiet and flexible transport of thousands of troops who were then able to surprise and confuse the defenders. Bicycles also made few demands on the Japanese war machine, needing neither trucks nor ships to transport them, nor precious petroleum. Although the Japanese were under orders not to embark for Malaya with bicycles, for fear of slowing up amphibious landings, they knew from intelligence that bicycles were plentiful in Malaya and moved to systematically confiscate bicycles from civilians and retailers as soon as they landed. Using bicycles, the Japanese troops were able to move faster than the withdrawing Allied Forces, often successfully cutting off their retreat. The speed of Japanese advance, usually along plantation roads, native paths and over improvised bridges, also caught Allied Forces defending the main roads and river crossings by surprise, by attacking them from the rear. However, there were one or two cases of Australian troops turning the tables on the Japanese by isolating cycle troops from their accompanying motorized forces after blowing up bridges over rivers.

During the Invasion of Poland of 1939, most Polish infantry divisions included a company of bicycle-riding scouts. The equipment of each bicycle company included 196 bicycles, one motorcycle with sidecar, and nine horse-drawn supply carts, plus three to six anti-tank rifles and standard infantry equipment such as machine guns, rifles, pistols, and hand grenades.

The Finnish Army utilized bicycles extensively during the Continuation War and Lapland War. Bicycles were used as a means of transportation in Jaeger Battalions, divisional Light Detachments and regimental organic Jaeger Companies. Bicycle units spearheaded the advances of 1941 against the Soviet Union. Especially successful was the 1st Jaeger Brigade which was reinforced with a tank battalion and an anti-tank battalion, providing rapid movement through limited road network. During winter time these units, like the rest of the infantry, switched to skis. Within 1942–1944 bicycles were also added to regimental equipment pools. During the Summer 1944 battles against the Soviet Union, bicycles provided quick mobility for reserves and counter-attacks. In Autumn 1944 bicycle troops of the Jaeger Brigade spearheaded the Finnish advance through Lapland against the Germans; tanks had to be left behind due to the German destruction of the Finnish road network.

The hastily assembled German Volksgrenadier divisions each had a battalion of bicycle infantry, to provide a mobile reserve.

Allied use of the bicycle in World War II was limited, but included supplying folding bicycles to paratroopers and to messengers behind friendly lines. The term &quot;bomber bikes&quot; came into use during this period, as US forces dropped bicycles out of planes to reach troops behind enemy lines.

By 1939, the Swedish Army operated six bicycle infantry regiments. They were equipped with domestically produced Swedish military bicycles. Most common was the m/42, an upright, one-speed roadster produced by several large Swedish bicycle manufacturers. These regiments were decommissioned between 1948 and 1952, and the bicycles remained for general use in the Army, or were transferred to the Home Guard. Beginning in the 1970s, the Army began to sell these as military surplus. They became very popular as cheap and low-maintenance transportation, especially among students. Responding to its popularity and limited supply, an unrelated company, Kronan, began to produce a modernized version of the m/42 in 1997.

=== Later uses ===
Although much used in World War I, bicycles were largely superseded by motorized transport in more modern armies. In the past few decades, however, they have taken on a new life as a &quot;weapon of the people&quot; in guerrilla conflicts and unconventional warfare, where the cycle&#x27;s ability to carry large, about , loads of supplies at the speed of a pedestrian make it useful for lightly equipped forces. For many years the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army used bicycles to ferry supplies down the &quot;Ho Chi Minh trail&quot;, avoiding the repeated attacks of United States and Allied bombing raids. When heavily loaded with supplies such as sacks of rice, these bicycles were seldom rideable, but were pushed by a &quot;tender&quot; walking alongside. With especially bulky cargo, tenders sometimes attached bamboo poles to the bike for tiller-like steering (this method can still be seen practiced in China today). Vietnamese &quot;cargo bikes&quot; were rebuilt in jungle workshops with reinforced frames to carry heavy loads over all terrain.

===21st century===

The use of the cycle as an infantry transport tool continued into the 21st century with the Swiss Army&#x27;s Bicycle Regiment, which maintained drills for infantry movement and attack until 2001, when the decision was made to phase the unit out.

Although the impact of bicycles is limited in modern warfare, the Finnish Defence Forces still trains all conscripts to use bicycles and skis. American Paratroopers have jumped folding mountain bikes in several Airborne operations 

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam made use of bicycle mobility during the Sri Lankan Civil War.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, electric bicycles were used by Ukrainian forces to carry NLAW anti-tank missiles.

<doc id="1131961" wikidata="Q1180803" url="?curid=1131961" title="Dead End (2003 film)">
<text>Dead End is a 2003 English-language French horror film written and directed by Jean-Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa, and starring Alexandra Holden, Ray Wise, Lin Shaye, Mick Cain, Billy Asher, and Amber Smith. It tells the story of a dysfunctional family who find themselves on a never-ending road in the middle of a forest during a routine drive on Christmas Eve, while under pursuit of a mysterious hearse and a woman dressed in white.

==Plot==
Driving on Christmas Eve with his family, Frank Harrington decides to take a short cut through a remote location because he is &quot;bored&quot; with the usual route. In the car with him: his wife Laura, his son, Richard, his daughter, Marion, and her boyfriend, Brad.

After a near-collision with another car, a white-clad woman appears at Frank&#x27;s window, holding a baby. Marion suggests they drive the woman to a nearby cabin; because the car is full, she volunteers to follow behind them on foot. When they arrive at the cabin, Frank and Laura go to explore it and Richard disappears into the woods, leaving Brad alone with the woman. He asks how the child she carries can breathe with its face covered by blankets. She replies that it is dead and shows him the corpse. His screams of terror draw Richard back to the car, but Brad and the woman are nowhere to be seen. As she walks to the cabin, Marion sees a hearse drive by with Brad screaming for help in the back. When she gets to the cabin, she makes them pursue the hearse.

They find Brad&#x27;s mutilated body in the road. Laura calls the police but on the end of the line is a woman begging for help, something that she hides from her family. As they continue to drive, Frank and Laura argue, and he reveals that he dislikes her family. When they stop to investigate a baby carriage in the road, Richard is abducted by the hearse. While the three run to save Richard, Frank sees the &quot;woman in white&quot; again. They find Richard&#x27;s body and Laura begins to show signs of insanity.

The family pass a sign that says &quot;Marcott&quot; and Frank realizes that this must be a military road that is not on the map. During another stop, Laura shoots Frank in the leg with a shotgun that was intended to be a present for a family member. Shortly after, Laura talks about seeing the face of a friend who had died 20 years earlier in the woods and jumps out of the car to &quot;visit&quot; with her. The hearse appears again, but Frank manages to ward it off with the shotgun. Instead he shoots Laura in the head, killing her. Frank and Marion take her to a nearby rangers station, where Frank writes a note to later give to Marion. The woman in white attacks Frank. Afterwards, he becomes deranged and beats Marion into unconsciousness. Seeing the woman in white again, he pursues her into the woods, where he is killed by an unseen force.

Marion awakens and, because the car is out of gas, walks for help. She finds body bags containing her dead family members in the middle of the road. The woman in white appears, tells her that the hearse isn&#x27;t there for her, then gets into the hearse and drives off.

Marion suddenly awakens in the hospital, heavily bandaged. Dr. Marcott tells her of her coma and assures Marion that she and the baby will be fine. On the way out of the hospital, the doctor talks to a man claiming to be the one that found the family after the car crash. The man confirms that only Marion survived and that the crash also claimed the life of a young woman and her baby in the other car. When the doctor tries to leave, her car fails to start, and the man who found the family offers her a lift in the same hearse from Marion&#x27;s dream.

Two workers who are sweeping up debris from the crash find the note Frank had written to Marion before their final stop.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot in Los Angeles County, California in 2002.

==Release==
After its premiere at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer in January 2003, the film received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2003.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film as &quot;macabre and supernatural in the approved manner, not stunningly original, but with some ingenious twists and humorous performances.&quot; Neil Smith of BBC gave the film three out of five stars, writing &quot;&quot;Dead End&quot;— feels like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone, but it&#x27;s witty and chilling enough to offer some spine-tingling surprises en route.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Derek Elley wrote: &quot;With most of the gore off-screen, and almost the entire film set within the family car or on the country road, Andrea &amp; Canepa manage to sustain interest largely through dialogue, pitched at a satisfyingly pulpy level and played with straight-faced glee by the small cast.&quot;

John Noonan of &quot;HorrorNews.net&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;A potent mix of nasty and fun, &quot;Dead End&quot; is the perfect film to put on at family gatherings to get them all out of your house.&quot; Arrow in the Head rated the film a score of 7 out of 10, commending the film&#x27;s atmosphere, performances, humor, and tension, while criticizing the soundtrack as being &quot;a mixed bag&quot;. Johnny Butane from Dread Central gave the film a score of 3.5 out of 5, praising the film&#x27;s performances, plot, and blend of thrills and humor, while noting the film&#x27;s weak ending.

<text>Czernina (, from &quot;czarny&quot; – &quot;black&quot;; also spelled &quot;czarnina&quot; or &quot;czarna polewka&quot; – &quot;black soup&quot;) is a Polish soup traditionally made of duck blood and clear poultry broth. Rabbit or pig blood can also be used as alternatives. In English it can be called &quot;duck blood soup&quot;.

==Flavours==
Generally the sweet and sour taste of the soup comes from the balance of sugar and vinegar. However, there are hundreds of recipes popular in different parts of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. Among the ingredients used are plum or pear syrup, dried pears, plums or cherries, apple vinegar and honey. Like most Polish soups, czernina is usually served with kluski, fine noodles, macaroni, boiled potatoes, or dumplings.

==Symbol==
Until the 19th century czernina was also a symbol in Polish culture. It was served to young men applying for the hand of their beloved. If the suitor was rejected, he would be served czernina. It is a plot element in &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, a famous Polish epic poem by Adam Mickiewicz.

It is also a regional dish in Kashubia, Masuria and Poznań.

Czernina is very similar to Swedish svartsoppa.

<doc id="1131985" wikidata="Q7079536" url="?curid=1131985" title="Official National Front">
<text>The Official National Front (ONF) was one of two far-right groups to emerge in the United Kingdom in 1986 following a split within the National Front. Following ideological paths that were mostly new to the British far-right, the ONF stood opposed to the more traditionalist Flag Group.

==Development==
The ONF emerged in the early 1980s when young radicals such as Nick Griffin, Derek Holland, Patrick Harrington and David Kerr became attracted to Third Position ideas and, eschewing the route of electoral politics favoured by the National Front up to that point, hoped to develop a cadre of devoted nationalist revolutionaries. Emphasising a strong anti-capitalist as well as anti-communist line, the ONF began to emerge as the most powerful group within the NF after the series of splits in late 1979 and early 1980 though they did not come to prominence within the NF until 1984 when Martin Webster was expelled from the Party.

The Political Soldier faction began with the support of chairman Andrew Brons but before long differences between the two factions began to show. This came to a head in 1986 when the party split in two, with around 2,000 of the NF&#x27;s 5,000 membership following Griffin into the ONF and the rest departing for the Flag Group. The ONF maintained the monthly newspaper the &quot;National Front News&quot; and took control also of &quot;Nationalism Today&quot; during this period.

With control assured the ONF took on responsibility for instructing its members ideologically and gained the backing of Rosine de Bounevialle, a veteran of the League of Empire Loyalists and the publisher of the anti-Semitic journal &quot;Candour&quot;, who allowed these training seminars to be held on her Hampshire estate. Subsequently, these were moved to specially prepared buildings on land owned by Nick Griffin&#x27;s father Edgar.

==Ideology==
Aided by Roberto Fiore, whose &quot;Terza Posizione&quot; held similar views, the ONF developed an ideology that stressed the need for a &quot;New Man&quot; with the cadre structure influenced by the &quot;nest&quot; system of the pre-Second World War Romanian Iron Guard. The two main sources of ideology for the ONF were the journal &quot;Rising&quot; published from 1983 to 1986 and &quot;The Political Soldier&quot;, a 1984 book by Derek Holland. Within the pages of these works the ONF committed itself to a revolt against modernity, echoing many of the words of the likes of Corneliu Codreanu and Julius Evola. The party put emphasis on the values of ruralism with Nick Griffin, who lived on a farm in Wales, running a &quot;Smash the Cities&quot; campaign for the ONF that has been compared by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke to Pol Potism.

Unlike the earlier NF, that had emphasised British identity, the ONF showed sympathy towards indigenous nationalisms within the United Kingdom. The ONF adopted a policy of support for Ulster nationalism, a fringe idea within Northern Ireland, and through this shift forged links with the Ulster Defence Association and in particular John McMichael who was advocating such an idea at the time. Separate links were also maintained with sometime Democratic Unionist Party activist George Seawright who, although not avowedly an Ulster nationalist, was the brother of ONF activist David Seawright. Although there was no evidence of a direct connection between the two groups the ONF broke from the exclusively British nationalist vision of its predecessors to praise the activities of the Welsh nationalist Meibion Glyndŵr.

The desire for the development of a fanatical Political Soldier also led the ONF to follow their Italian counterparts in expressing some admiration for a similar fanaticism that they saw in Islam. This idea led to the publication of the most notorious issue of &quot;NF News&quot; which featured a cover extolling the &#x27;new alliance&#x27; of the party with the Ayatollah Khomeini, Muammar Gaddafi and Louis Farrakhan, a previously unthinkable stance in the NF. During a march for Quds Day in 1988 Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson took their place alongside a group of Islamic fundamentalists.

The &#x27;scientific racism&#x27; that had been the cornerstone of NF ideas up to that point was abandoned by the ONF in favour of an emphasis on ethnopluralism and expressions of admiration for Black separatist leaders such as Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey, a new departure illustrated by the August 1987 edition of &quot;National Front News&quot; in which the slogan &#x27;Black is beautiful&#x27; appeared. Copies of the Nation of Islam-linked newspaper &quot;The Final Call&quot; could also be purchased from the ONF.

==Decline==
The desire to build a Political Soldier leadership meant that the ONF was by its nature exclusive and limited. Membership in its strictest sense was effectively closed off with outsiders only allowed to become &quot;Friends of the Movement&quot; and full membership being only open to those chosen by the leadership. The ideas held less appeal for the racist skinheads that the ONF still had links with. The ONF saw the skinheads as a source of eager foot-soldiers for their revolutionary struggles, a factor that led the ONF to host Rock Against Communism concerts in the mid-1980s. However, disillusionment set in with the ONF&#x27;s esoteric ideas and in 1987 sometime NF member and Skrewdriver singer Ian Stuart Donaldson joined with British Movement organiser Nicky Crane to set up Blood and Honour, initially as a magazine before developing it into a movement for White power bands independent of the parties. The departure of these groups also meant a loss of one of the ONF&#x27;s main sources of revenue and the split proved fairly divisive with B&amp;H supporters dubbing the ONF the &quot;Nutty Fairy Party&quot; due to their unusual ideas and rumours of homosexuality within the leadership. The split came at a bad time as membership had already been curtailed by the decision in 1986 to double the price of membership fees and to restrict membership to those considered worthy of Political Soldier status by the leadership. The group&#x27;s devotion to the likes of Evola and Codreanu also damaged its chances as these thinkers were virtually unknown in Britain and as such the ONF&#x27;s ideas were considered too foreign to be relevant to a British context.

In an attempt to gain much needed funds, Griffin and Holland travelled to Libya in 1988 in the hope of persuading Muammar Gaddafi to provide money to bankroll the ONF. However, the pair were able to secure only a consignment of copies of the colonel&#x27;s political testament &quot;The Green Book&quot;, meaning that the group&#x27;s financial woes were not alleviated. Breaking from its own ban on electoral activity, Harrington ran as a candidate in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election, during which his rival candidates included the Flag Group&#x27;s Ted Budden, who confusingly was standing as a &quot;National Front&quot; candidate. Both men received derisory vote shares.

In 1989 Harrington, who was by then effective leader of the group, approached &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; with a view to opening dialogue with the Jewish community. The move proved unpopular with Griffin and Holland who broke off in 1989 to form the International Third Position (ITP), which advocated anti-capitalist Strasserist views, as well as continuing anti-Zionism. With the ONF in disarray, Harrington (by then effective leader, although the ONF had eschewed an individual leader at their peak) wound up the group in January 1990 and reconstituted it, along with about fifty NF members, as the Third Way, which continued to offer a programme akin to that of the Political Soldier movement. The Flag Group, led by Martin Wingfield and Ian Anderson, reclaimed the NF name and identity and sought to reposition the NF once again by following the example of the base itself on the &quot;Front National&quot;, which was experiencing growth in France through right-wing populism.

<doc id="1131987" wikidata="Q959939" url="?curid=1131987" title="Patrol Air Cushion Vehicle">
<text>The Patrol Air Cushion Vehicle (PACV), also known as the Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV) in Army and Coast Guard service, was a United States Navy and Army hovercraft used as a patrol boat in marshy and riverine areas during the Vietnam War between 1966 and 1970. Six hovercraft were built, three for the Army and three for the Navy.

The military developed the PACV because its lack of draft meant that it could operate unimpeded in the shallow and reed-choked waters widespread in South Vietnam, most notably in the Mekong Delta and Plain of Reeds. The PACV was also found to be valuable because of its unusually high speed of , faster than other watercraft in the conflict. However, it faced major drawbacks, including its high cost of $1 million (equivalent to 13 Patrol Boat, Rivers) and unreliability. During the conflict, two of the Army&#x27;s three hovercraft were destroyed by the Viet Cong. The PACVs in Vietnam were considered &quot;unsuccessful&quot; in evaluations and were withdrawn in 1970. Following their service in Vietnam, the Navy PACVs returned to the United States where they were used by the Coast Guard, where another sank in an accident.

==Development==
The PACV was based on the Bell Aerosystems SK-5 hovercraft; a licensed version of the British Saunders-Roe (later, British Hovercraft Corporation) SR.N5 hovercraft. The SK-5 was adapted for American military use in 1965. Three were purchased by the US Navy for operations in the emerging Vietnam War. Training of PACV crews was performed in the waters off Coronado, California near San Diego. Design of the Army ACVs began in 1966 and was completed

==Design==
Two different designs were made: one for the Navy and one for the Army. The Navy&#x27;s hovercraft, called Patrol Air Cushion Vehicles, more closely resembled the civilian SK-5s that they were based on while the Army craft had more extensive modifications. Each hovercraft was long, with a beam of and a height of when floating on its air cushion. It weighed fully loaded. Army and Navy PACVs had a crew of 4—driver, radar operator, and gunners—and could carry up to 12 troops, many of whom rode on the outside of the vehicle.
Both designs were powered by a General Electric 7LM100-PJ102 gas turbine engine. The engine, its 304-gallon (1,150 litre) fuel tank, an auxiliary power unit, and the Westland transmission were located amidships. The engine powered both the three-blade variable-pitch propeller for thrust and the diameter centrifugal fan for lift. The transmission served to link the engine and lift fan so that the fan could provide lift and thrust. Twin rudders and elevators sat behind the fans. As a hovercraft, the PACV could skim over water, including shallow and reed-choked waters, flat land, and ice. The PACV/ACV was very fast compared to contemporary watercraft, being capable of speeds up to . It had a range of and endurance of seven hours

The Army hovercraft, called Air Cushion Vehicles, had more extensive modifications. They had heavier armor and reinforced, load-bearing decks. Army ACVs carried of armor—roughly equal to that of an M113 armored personnel carrier. The armor was thickest around the engine, transmission, and fuel tanks, providing protection from .50 caliber rounds fired at , while the armor around the crew compartment could only block .30 caliber rounds fired at . To save weight, many crews removed the armor around the crew compartment, and an Army evaluation recommended that it be removed altogether because of it &quot;did not provide any protection to the crew,&quot; especially against heavier weapons such as recoilless rifles, artillery, and RPGs.

The communications package consisted of a six-station intercom system, UHF radios, and a radio security set. The boats were shipped with AN/ARC-54 FM radios. However, these proved unreliable, with an operational ready rate of only 35 percent. Army units sought to replace them with VRC-125s. While it is not known if this replacement occurred, one ACV did receive a VRC-46 radio. The hovercraft carried a Decca 202 radar with a dish antenna, which could detect targets within . Some Army ACVs were fitted with XM3 Personnel Detectors (better known as XM-3 &quot;people sniffers&quot;), which could detect human emissions including carbon and ammonia. This equipment was used to find hidden enemies. Dog teams were also sometimes carried to help detect enemies. The radar was found to be very effective, including for navigating in low-visibility and foggy conditions.
The PACV was armed with twin .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in a roof-mounted turret in the front and two 7.62mm M60 machine guns, one port and one starboard. The Army initially equipped their hovercraft with a minigun and 40 mm M5 automatic grenade launcher as well. Only one ACV was outfitted with a grenade launcher, however, and the miniguns were removed to make space for more troops and cargo because it was found to be effective only for suppressive fire.

The Army ACVs had other improvements over the Navy PACVs beyond their additional armor, namely a wider cockpit, more horsepower, two gun positions instead of one, and a flat deck on top of the skirt for troops to ride on.

==Operational history==

PACVs were first deployed to Vietnam in May 1966 as PACV Division 107, Task Force 116, where they were used by the Navy for riverine patrol missions in the Mekong Delta and on the Mekong River. Often called &quot;Pac Vees&quot;, they were armed with a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on a rotating platform in the front and two side-mounted M60 machine guns. In addition, the crew, and often US Army Special Forces and ARVN Rangers, riding on the side panels, employed assorted small arms such as M16 rifles and M79 grenade launchers as well as various other rifles, .45 pistols, light and medium machine guns, and grenades, although using small arms was dangerous because spent casings could fall into the propeller. The PACV was used to prevent Viet Cong infiltration from the sea and tidal areas along river mouths and deltas. It was especially useful in shallow marshy areas, especially the Mekong Delta, where other patrol boats such as the Patrol Boat, River or Patrol Craft Fast (Swift boat) could not go.

The PACV&#x27;s relatively light weight of only seven tonnes meant that it could be easily carried by a CH-54 helicopter. This allowed it to be airlifted between forward operating bases or transported back to base when it suffered damage. The PACV could also be split into sections and then transported in Air Force transport planes, which was how they were brought to Vietnam.

Navy PACVs were deployed in Operations Game Warden and Market Time, the Navy&#x27;s operations to deny Viet Cong access to resources in the Mekong Delta and prevent North Vietnamese weapons, fighters, and supplies from entering South Vietnam, respectively. The PACVs were deemed unsuitable for Operation Game Warden because of their &quot;mechanical unreliability&quot; and the limitations imposed on them by terrain. As a result, they were removed from the operation and transferred to another Navy unit, CTF 117. They were also found unsuitable for Market Time operations after serving in that operation from 20 September to 17 October 1966, due to their high noise, low visibility, high cost, and limited utility on the high seas or in narrow waterways. In November 1966, the Navy PACVs were used to great effect in Operation Quai Vat (Vietnamese for &quot;Monster&quot;, which was what the Viet Cong called the PACVs). In the operation on the Plain of Reeds, conducted jointly with Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) troops and Army helicopters and special forces, the PACV force brought its speed and firepower to bear on the Viet Cong, killing at least 23 of them, destroying 70 of their sampans and an equal number of their structures, taking many prisoners, and capturing their supplies. This demonstration of combat prowess in the marshy terrain in southwestern Vietnam formed the basis for stationing the Army ACVs in the Plain of Reeds along the South Vietnamese/Cambodian border. An Army evaluation found that in the Plain of Reeds, &quot;any mission requiring ground operations can best be accomplished by ACV unts,&quot; particularly reconnaissance, light assaults, infantry transport, canal security, cordoning off areas to prevent escape, and patrolling. Though the loud noise of the PACVs was an issue, their speed made up for it in this otherwise difficult terrain, especially during the monsoon season. The PACV could clear rice paddy dikes and other solid obstacles up to high and negotiate slopes of up to . However, the PACV did not perform well in the dry season, with an Army evaluation noting that &quot;The wetter the season, the better for vehicle operations&quot;.

The Navy withdrew the PACVs for overhaul in January 1967 and redeployed them to Vietnam in early 1968. Also in 1968, the Army began employing its version of the PACV, the ACV. The Army acquired the vehicles and activated their unit, the 39th Cavalry Platoon, in January before deploying them to Vietnam in April. There were only three Navy PACVs and three Army ACVs during the whole Vietnam War. Two of the three ACVs (No. 901 and 902) were Assault Air Cushion Vehicles (AACV), weapons-heavy vessels configured for attack missions, while the other (No. 903) was a Transport Air Cushion Vehicle (TACV) configured for logistics missions. The TACV only carried the twin M60s, forgoing the .50 cal and other weapons to increase space in the cabin for carrying troops. Both AACVs were lost to Viet Cong attacks. Navy PACVs were based out of Cat Lo Naval Base and operated by Task Forces 116 and 117. The three Army ACVs were operated by the 39th Cavalry Platoon, 9th Division, and were based out of Ben Luc and Đồng Tâm Base Camp, although they often deployed from fire support bases.

The Green Berets stationed in Moc Hoa became proponents of the PACVs, using them in many of their early operations. Search and destroy raids conducted out of Moc Hoa in November 1966 caught the Viet Cong by surprise and resulted in many Viet Cong deaths.

The PACV&#x27;s speed, maneuverability, and firepower lent themselves to many types of missions, including patrolling, search and destroy, escorting other ships, raiding, reconnaissance, medical evacuation, transporting artillery pieces, and providing fire support to infantry. It was best suited for ambushes and raids, especially at night, when it could be easily concealed behind reeds and swamp grass. Although it was too loud to be very effective at surprise attacks, it could use its speed to raid Viet Cong bases and escape before they could react. The PACV was found to be most effective when employed in combined arms operations alongside helicopters, artillery, and other watercraft; patrol missions conducted in concert with air cavalry or Hurricane Aircat airboats were found to be especially effective. The PACV&#x27;s low profile and radar also meant that it was used as a stealthy stationary radar station when its engines were off. However, Army evaluations found that the ACV had insufficient firepower, being unable to damage armored or fortified targets, and recommended that it be outfitted with heavier weapons such as TOW missiles, 20mm autocannons (such as the M139 or M61 Vulcan), or 106mm M40 recoilless rifle. They also found that it could be too loud to be used effectively for patrol and interdiction missions. Fuel resupply was another frequently cited issue for longer missions, especially given that no adequate method of refueling in the field existed.

The PACV was frequently compared to a helicopter because of its speed, terrain crossing ability, maintenance requirements, and cost. Army ACV units operated similarly to air cavalry.

Operating these highly specialized vehicles required pilots and maintenance personnel undergo considerable training, with pilots requiring 75–100 hours of flight experience before participating in combat. Training requirements meant that the Army had to set one craft aside for training for 14 days every month. Troops riding in and on the PACVs also needed training to use them safely: during evaluation, one soldier died when he fell into the hovercraft&#x27;s intake, and another lost his hand to the propeller.
Another downside of the PACV was the degree of maintenance it required: each hour of operation required 20 hours of maintenance, double the 10-hour average for contemporary military helicopters. An Army evaluation found that the PACV had an operationally ready rate of 55.7 percent, and all three Army ACVs were only operational during June 1969. This maintenance requirement, which was made even worse when the vehicles suffered damage, combined with the insufficient firepower to lead an Army evaluation to conclude that &quot;there is no hope of the [PACV/ACV] unit fighting to a satisfactory conclusion in any large engagement.&quot; The PACV was also very expensive, costing about $1 million each, as much as 13 Patrol Boat, Rivers.

Because of their high profile and degree of threat, the PACVs and ACVs in Vietnam became major targets. The Viet Cong used ambushes and naval mines against the PACVs. Mines proved especially effective: Army ACV 902 was destroyed by a tripwire-triggered mine on 9 January 1970. Though no one onboard was killed, 14 men were injured and the attack slowed the pace of ACV operations because of Army regulations stipulating that the hovercraft work in pairs to protect each other. When ACV 901 was destroyed by a command-detonated mine on 3 August 1970, killing three, the ACVs were deactivated. The 39th ACV Platoon ceased operations on 31 August 1970 and officially left Vietnam in September, transferring their sole surviving ACV to the Army Transportation Museum in Virginia. Navy PACVs returned to the continental United States that August as well. In total, Navy PACVs saw more than 4,500 hours of operation.

===US Coast Guard service===

Following their withdrawal in 1970, the Navy PACVs were transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard for evaluation. The Coast Guard used PACVs, which they called Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs), through 1975, when they cancelled the ACV program due to budget constraints. Two were stationed at Fort Point, San Francisco and the third was used for Arctic Trials in Point Barrow, Alaska, though they were also tested in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. The Coast Guard PACVs were modified to meet their requirements by replacing the .50 cal gun mount with an observation dome and adding a KAAR LN66 radar and search-and-rescue equipment. Coast Guard PACVs were crewed by 3—operator, radar operator and navigator, and search-and-rescue crewman—and could carry 6 passengers and half a ton of cargo. Because it was lighter than the military version, the Coast Guard ACV could go up to and had a range of .

The ACVs in Coast Guard service were used primarily for search-and-rescue missions because of their speed and range. In over 185 search-and-rescue missions, they towed boats up to long and recovered survivors from the water and then rushed them to the shore. However, they were also used to service buoys, resupply and repair remote lighthouses and lightships, enforce laws, clean up oil spills, and ferry personnel and supplies. For minor repairs to buoys, the ACV shortened what was normally a full day mission by a fully crewed ship to a 2-3 hour one by an ACV with three crew members. The ACV was fast enough that it was able to respond to search-and-rescue calls while servicing buoys, something that was not possible for regular Coast Guard cutters. However, servicing structures in choppy weather on the open sea was found to be dangerous. The ACV proved particularly effective in the Arctic because it could traverse water and ice equally well at high speeds, although crews did encounter some issues relating to windshield icing.

At least one ACV was active in San Francisco Bay 24/7, and a special hangar for the ACVs was built at the Coast Guard Station at Fort Point from August 1970 to 1972. The San Francisco ACVs were evaluated for use as a crash/fire rescue vehicle at Oakland International Airport in 1972 and were found to be successful. One of the San Francisco-based ACVs was showcased by the Coast Guard at the U.S. International Transportation Exposition at Dulles International Airport in 1972, where it was inspected by tens of thousands of international visitors. Over the first two years of evaluation, the Coast Guard ACVs accrued over 1,500 hours of operating time.

As part of the evaluation, the ACV at Point Barrow was transferred to Traverse City, Michigan for refurbishment and then stationed at St. Ignace Coast Guard Station on Lake Huron. It sank on 23 November 1971 after only 26 hours of operation in Lake Huron, after the cabin was breached by a rock and the engine inexplicably failed, leading the craft to take on water and sink. After this sinking, one of the two San Francisco ACVs was then transferred to the Great Lakes. Another was transferred to the East Coast, where it performed aids to navigation survey/inspection and search-and-rescue operations on Chesapeake Bay, while the third remained in San Francisco Bay. The Chesapeake ACV was found to be particularly valuable for search-and-rescue operations in marshy or shallow waters. In the final Coast Guard evaluation, Commander Thomas Lutton wrote that &quot;The ACV has dramatically and repeatedly demonstrated its capability to effectively perform a wide range of Coast Guard missions.&quot; However, the Coast Guard was in the middle of a large upgrade of its other boats and cutters at the time and so did not have the money to acquire ACVs. As such, the two surviving ACVs were transferred to US Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 25 April 1975.

===Survivors===
*The sole surviving Army ACV (No. 903) was transferred to the U.S. Army Transportation Museum in Fort Eustis, Virginia, where it is still on display .

*The only surviving US Navy PACV (No. 004) is preserved at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California.

<text>The Franchise was a Washington, D.C.–based rock band. Their music was described as &quot;geek rock&quot;, delving into the harrowing world of pet monitoring devices, comic books, and Middle Eastern food. Influences include what used to be called “college rock,” alternative rock, and New Wave—things along the lines of Talking Heads, R.E.M., They Might Be Giants, U2, The Cure, XTC, Cake, early The Police.

Patrick Nolan played drums in the jazz band &quot;Kurds and Whey&quot; from 1991 to 1993, and then released a solo album, &quot;Gone Astray&quot; in 2003.

David played guitar in the rock band &quot;The Sunmasons&quot; from 1989 to 1992, and released one cassette, &quot;It&#x27;s OK, I&#x27;m with the BAND&quot; in 1991. He then went on to sing in the a cappella group &quot;Makela&quot; along with Jerry Marzouk.

Noah and Jackson were both singers in the Spizzwinks(?).

Patrick and David started playing together in 2003, and in 2004 invited Jerry to join them as a keyboard player. They then asked their friend Anna London to join them as she learned to play bass.

==Demolition==

Shortly after forming, they recorded &quot;Demolition&quot; at Hit &amp; Run Studios in Gaithersburg, Maryland. &quot;Demolition&quot; had three original songs, &quot;Aliyah L&#x27;Regel&quot;, &quot;Post-Apocalyptic Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Cyrano&quot;, and a cover of The Police song &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;.

Cover art for &quot;Demolition&quot; was created by Patrick.

Shortly after releasing &quot;Demolition&quot;, Noah Kaye joined the band after attending one of the early performances.

==The Sound and the Furry==

In early 2005, they recorded most of the tracks for &quot;The Sound and the Furry&quot;, live at Avalon Recording studios in Bethesda, Maryland. Two of the songs, &quot;Lojack&quot; and &quot;King of Falafel&quot;, were recorded at the Brass Monkey Saloon in Baltimore, Maryland, and &quot;Late Summer&quot; was recorded at Umbrella Studios in Arlington, Virginia.

The cover art was an homage to the Beatles album &quot;Let it Be&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s pets.

Almost immediately after Figmental Records released &quot;The Sound and the Furry&quot;, Jerry left the band, and Noah took on primary vocal duties.

==To the Rescue!==

In 2006, they decided to record another album with a more &#x27;produced&#x27; sound, and returned to Hit &amp; Run Studios to do so. DC comic artist Jake Warrenfelz was commissioned to design the cover, which envisioned the band defending the US Capitol from attack by a giant squid.

Before the recording was finished, Anna left the band, and the other members took turns filling in for her on the CD. Jackson Maier replaced her shortly before the CD was released, but after the recording was finished.

==Lingua Franchise==
In 2008, they completed another album and hosted their launch party at The Grog and Tankard in Washington, DC on June 7, 2008.

<doc id="1132003" wikidata="Q162174" url="?curid=1132003" title="Air Dolomiti">
<text>Air Dolomiti S.p.A. L.A.R.E (&quot;Linee Aeree Regionali Europee&quot;) is an Italian regional airline, wholly-owned by Lufthansa. It is a member of Lufthansa Regional and has its head office in Dossobuono, Villafranca di Verona. Its hubs are at Verona Villafranca Airport, Florence Airport and Venice Marco Polo Airport and focus cities at Munich Airport and Frankfurt Airport in Germany.

Air Dolomiti operates routes from several Italian destinations to and from Munich and Frankfurt. Most of these services are sold under the Air Dolomiti brand and codeshare with Lufthansa, while a few remain under the Lufthansa brand.

==History==
===Foundation===
Air Dolomiti was established on 30 December 1989 by the &quot;Linee Aeree Europee (L.A.E)&quot;. The airline&#x27;s name derives from the section of the Alps known as the Dolomites. It started airline operations in January 1991 with a Trieste-Genoa route. In 1992, the airline started international services with flights from Verona to Munich.

===Takeover by Lufthansa===
After several years of co-operation, Lufthansa acquired a 26% stake in January 1999 and increased it to 52% in April 2003 and 100% in July 2003. Although most Lufthansa Regional subsidiaries operate under their parent&#x27;s name and colours, Air Dolomiti retains its own identity. 

The airline employed some 748 people in June 2020. At one time the airline&#x27;s registered office was in Dossobuono, Villafranca di Verona, while the airline&#x27;s executive headquarters were in Ronchi dei Legionari.

In September 2018, Lufthansa announced it would expand Air Dolomiti&#x27;s fleet significantly by 12 pre-owned Embraer 190 and 195 aircraft to be transferred from sister company Lufthansa CityLine. However in late 2021, Lufthansa stated that the transfer was no longer confirmed and may be continued later or on a smaller scale if at all. Later on, two Embraer 195 were transferred from Lufthansa CityLine by spring 2022. In late 2022, Lufthansa confirmed it would transfer further aircraft from Lufthansa CityLine to Air Dolomiti to strengthen the group&#x27;s presence in Italy after its bid to take over ITA Airways fell apart.

In March 2024, Lufthansa announced plans to expand Air Dolomiti&#x27;s fleet to 25 aircraft within the year, as the subsidiary is scheduled to take over more routes within the Lufthansa Group network.

== Destinations ==
, Air Dolomiti operates routes from Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport to 26 destinations in Italy, as well as to other European countries on behalf of its corporate parent, Lufthansa.

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Dolomiti has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

* Air Canada
* Air China
* All Nippon Airways
* ITA Airways (begins 30 March 2025)
* Lufthansa
* United Airlines

==Sponsorship==
Over the years, Air Dolomiti has established various partnerships and sponsorships. Its Settimocielo onboard service collaborated with renowned chefs such as Simone Rugiati (2015) and Giancarlo Perbellini (2016), as well as with JRE Jeunes Restaurateurs (2017). The airline also partnered with prominent wineries, including Aneri, Marchesi Antinori, and Masi, which was named Air Dolomiti’s &quot;Wine of the Year&quot; for 2018.

==Fleet==

===Current fleet===
, Air Dolomiti operates the following aircraft:

Several of Air Dolomiti&#x27;s aircraft were named after Italian operas, as a tribute to the city of Verona and its ancient theatre, the Arena di Verona. The remaining christening names are removed during the repaint into the new livery.

===Former fleet===

In the past, Air Dolomiti previously operated the following types of aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*7 November 1999: Air Dolomiti Flight 2708, a Fokker 100, wet-leased from Alpi Eagles (registration I-ALPL, c/n 11250), flying from Venice, Italy, with 44 on board suffered landing gear failure while on the runway at Barcelona, Spain. It came to rest safely on a grassy area near the runway.

*24 August 2008: An Air Dolomiti ATR 72 (registration I-ADLM, c/n 543), operating flight LH3990 from Munich, Germany, to Bologna, Italy, abandoned take off due to smoke alarm. The airline treated the evacuation of the aircraft as a minor incident, but on August 26 an amateur video, filmed by a bystander, circulated on television and the Internet. The footage shows tense moments of some 60 passengers jumping from and fleeing the burning plane before the fire department extinguishes the flames.

*17 May 2012: An Air Dolomiti ATR 72-500 operating on flight EN-1912/LH-1912 from Munich to Venice returned to Munich after the right engine shut down and smoke was discovered in both cockpit and cabin. Shortly after touchdown the plane deviated from the southern runway and came to a standstill about 80 metres (262 feet) into the grass covered side strip. The nose gear was reported to have collapsed in the process. Of the 58 passengers and four crew members aboard, five passengers were reported to have received minor injuries.

<doc id="1132004" wikidata="Q283789" url="?curid=1132004" title="Metal rectifier">
<text>A metal rectifier is an early type of semiconductor rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide, germanium or selenium. They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers since the late 1920s, under the trade name Westector (now used as a trade name for an overcurrent trip device by Westinghouse Nuclear).

In some countries the term &quot;metal rectifier&quot; is applied to all such devices; in others the term &quot;metal rectifier&quot; normally refers to copper-oxide types, and &quot;selenium rectifier&quot; to selenium-iron types.

== Description ==

Metal rectifiers consist of washer-like discs of different metals, either copper (with an oxide layer to provide the rectification) or steel or aluminium, plated with selenium. The discs are often separated by spacer sleeves to provide cooling.

== Mode of operation ==
The principle of operation of a metal rectifier is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers (Schottky diodes and p–n diodes), but somewhat more complex. Both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors, in practice doped by impurities during manufacture. When they are deposited on metals, it would be expected that the result is a simple metal–semiconductor junction and that the rectification would be a result of a Schottky barrier.
However, this is not always the case: Siegfried Poganski discovered in the 1940s that the best selenium rectifiers were in fact semiconductor-semiconductor junctions between selenium and a thin cadmium selenide layer, generated out of the cadmium-tin metal coating during processing.
In any case the result is that there is a depletion region in the semiconductor, with a built-in electric field, and this provides the rectifying action.

== Performance ==
Compared to later silicon or germanium devices, copper-oxide rectifiers tended to have poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely more than a few volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure – a bridge rectifier for a 12V battery charger would often use 12 metal rectifiers. Selenium rectifiers were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.

== Applications ==
===Radio receivers===
Metal rectifiers were also used as envelope detector (AM demodulator) diodes in radio receivers. The WX6 Westector was a typical example. It was about the size and shape of an AAA battery, with threaded posts at each end to which connections were made. 

Selenium rectifiers were once widely used as high-voltage rectifiers in transformerless radio and TV sets, before cheaper silicon diodes became available. Although they were reasonably efficient in this application, (at least compared to vacuum-tube rectifiers), their internal resistance tended to increase as they aged. Apart from reducing the available high voltage, this tends to make them run hotter, producing an unpleasant smell as the selenium starts to evaporate.

===TV sets and photocopiers===

Specially designed selenium rectifiers were once widely used as EHT rectifiers in television sets and photocopiers. A layer of selenium was applied to a sheet of soft iron foil, and thousands of tiny discs (typically 2mm diameter) were punched out of this and assembled as &quot;stacks&quot; inside ceramic tubes. Rectifiers capable of supplying tens of thousands of volts could be made this way. Their internal resistance was extremely high, but most EHT applications only required a few hundred microamps at most, so this was not normally an issue. With the development of inexpensive high voltage silicon rectifiers, this technology has fallen into disuse.

===Electrolysis===
Metal rectifiers have been replaced by silicon diodes in most devices, however there are certain applications where the replacement of metal rectifiers with silicon units has proven impractical. These are mostly in electroplating, aluminium smelting and similar high-current low-voltage industrial applications, where the lower forward voltage drop of metal rectifiers is more important than their reverse breakdown voltage.

Wright-Phillips is the son of former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright. His half-brother, Shaun Wright-Phillips, was his teammate at the New York Red Bulls for two seasons. He grew up in Brockley, South London and attended the state school Kelsey Park School in Beckenham and then moved to Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham College nearby in New Cross Gate.

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
Wright-Phillips was the top scorer for the Manchester City reserve team in the 2003–04 season. On 6 December 2004, he scored his first Premier League goal, four minutes after making his league debut as a substitute for Jon Macken against Middlesbrough. His only goal of the following season was the last in a 4–1 win over Birmingham City on 17 December 2005.

===Southampton===
After many frustrating appearances for Manchester City, with few goals, Wright-Phillips was sold to Championship team Southampton for £500,000 on 5 July 2006. Half of the transfer fee was funded by a prize from Coca-Cola won in a competition by a fan. He made an immediate impact at Southampton, scoring on his debut against Derby County at Pride Park, and scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–0 win at St. Mary&#x27;s. He scored a total of 11 goals in the 2006–07 season. In 2007–08 he started the season with goals against Burnley and Queens Park Rangers. He made a total of 120 appearances for the club, scoring 24 goals.

On 15 July 2009, he signed a two-year deal with Plymouth Argyle of the Championship. After he recovered from a knee injury, Wright-Phillips made his debut for the club on 15 September 2009 against Watford. The knee injury occurred once again, and he was sidelined for another long-term spell. In January 2010, Wright-Phillips made his long-awaited return for Argyle in the FA Cup against Newcastle United. He made his first start for the club against Coventry City in March 2010, and scored his first goal for Plymouth against Bristol City on 16 March 2010.

Two days after the All-Star game, Red Bulls Sporting Director Andy Roxburgh claimed that Wright-Phillips&#x27; scoring exploits were producing international transfer interest in the player. On 23 August 2014, he scored his 19th and 20th goals of the season in a 4–2 win against Montreal Impact to surpass Juan Pablo Ángel&#x27;s club record for goals scored in a single season, and on 20 September he returned from a short-term injury to record his third hat trick of the 2014 MLS season in a 4–1 win over Seattle Sounders FC. On 26 October 2014 Wright-Phillips scored twice to equal the Major League Soccer season goal record of 27 goals as New York beat Sporting Kansas City 2–0 in the league&#x27;s regular-season finale.

<doc id="1132017" wikidata="Q979941" url="?curid=1132017" title="Lee Bollinger">
<text>Lee Carroll Bollinger (born April 30, 1946) is an American attorney and educator who served as the 19th president of Columbia University from 2002 to 2023 and as the 12th president of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002.

Bollinger is currently the Seth Low Professor and a faculty member at Columbia Law School. He is a legal scholar of the First Amendment and freedom of speech. While serving as President of the University of Michigan, he was at the center of two notable United States Supreme Court cases regarding the use of affirmative action in admissions processes. He also served as chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York board of directors in 2011, and was a member of the board from 2006 to 2012.

==Early life and education==
Bollinger was born in Santa Rosa, California, the son of Patricia Mary and Lee C. Bollinger. He was raised in Santa Rosa and Baker City, Oregon.

In 1963, Bollinger spent a year as an exchange student in Brazil with AFS Intercultural Programs. He received his B.S. in political science in 1968 from the University of Oregon, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was a brother in Theta Chi fraternity. In 1971, he received his J.D. from Columbia Law School.

==Career==
In 1971 and 1972, Bollinger served as a law clerk to Judge Wilfred Feinberg of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In 1972 and 1973, he was a law clerk to Chief Justice Warren Burger of the Supreme Court of the United States.

In 1973, Bollinger joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School, becoming a full professor in 1979, and dean of the school in 1987.

In 1994, he was appointed provost of Dartmouth College before returning to the University of Michigan, where he served as president from 1996 to 2002.

===Columbia University president===

Bollinger assumed his position as president of Columbia University in June 2002.

In 2003, was a named defendant representing the University of Michigan in the Supreme Court cases &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; and &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot;. In the Grutter case, the Court found by a 5–4 margin that the affirmative action policies of the University of Michigan Law School were constitutional. But at the same time, it found by a 6–3 margin in the Gratz case that the undergraduate admissions policies of Michigan were not narrowly tailored to a compelling interest in diversity and 20 predetermined points are awarded to underrepresented minorities, and thus that they violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In 2004, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Bollinger lived in the Columbia President&#x27;s House from February 2004 until the end of his tenure as president, after the building underwent a $23 million renovation.

In November 2006, Bollinger was elected to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a term lasting for three years.

On October 19, 2010, the Board of Trustees announced through a university-wide email that Bollinger had agreed to continue as president for at least the next five years.

Bollinger was the subject of criticism for his role in advocating the expansion of the university into the Manhattanville neighborhood and the use of eminent domain to help it seize property there. The Bollinger administration&#x27;s expansion plans were criticized as fundamentally incompatible with the 197/a plan for development crafted by the community, and for failing to address the neighborhood&#x27;s need to maintain affordable housing stock.

Bollinger attempted to expand the international scope of the university, took frequent trips abroad and invited world leaders to its campus. Bollinger was criticized for taking a neutral public position on controversies regarding the Middle East Languages and Cultures (MEALAC) department.

In 2013, Bollinger&#x27;s total compensation was $4.6 million, making him the highest paid private college president in the United States.

At a January 2021 rally during a student tuition strike protesting the university&#x27;s tuition rates, Young Democratic Socialists of America organizers cited as further evidence of alleged inequitable allocation of university resources the fact that Bollinger&#x27;s salary had been frozen that year, while Barnard College administration&#x27;s salaries had been cut, including by 20 percent in the case of Sian Beilock, Barnard College&#x27;s president.

In February 2022, the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; reported that Bollinger had purchased an Upper West Side apartment for $11.7 million. In 2008, his salary was $1.7 million.

Bollinger&#x27;s residence was the site of demonstrations in which his high salary was criticized as an example of the university&#x27;s &quot;inequitable allocation of resources.&quot;

====World Leaders Forum====

Columbia invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak at the World Leaders Forum on September 24, 2007. A number of local and national politicians denounced Columbia for hosting Ahmadinejad.

Bollinger described the event as part of &quot;Columbia&#x27;s long-standing tradition of serving as a major forum for robust debate, especially on global issues.&quot; Bollinger released a statement outlining his introduction, explaining to the student body that the free speech afforded to Ahmadinejad was for the sake of the students and the faculty rather than for the benefit of Ahmadinejad himself, whom Bollinger referred to as &quot;exhibiting all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator.&quot;

Bollinger was criticized by students at Columbia&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs, but praised by Bob Kerrey who said that Bollinger &quot;turned what could have been an embarrassment for higher education into something quite positive.&quot;

===Federal Reserve Bank of New York===
In July 2010, he was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York board of directors for 2011. Previously, he had served as deputy chair.

===Retirement===
On April 14, 2022, Bollinger announced in an email to the Columbia student body that he would be retiring from his role as President effective June 30, 2023. In January 2023, Columbia announced that Minouche Shafik, president of the London School of Economics, would succeed him as president of the university.

==Personal life==
Bollinger is married to artist Jean Magnano Bollinger. They have a son and a daughter and five grandchildren. Bollinger&#x27;s family is Catholic.

==Books==
In addition to his academic and administrative positions, Bollinger has written many articles and books on the subject of free speech.

==Background==
He was the only son of Marcus Beresford and his wife Frances Arabella, daughter of Joseph Leeson, 1st Earl of Milltown. Beresford was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1819 and a Master of Arts five years later. He joined the British Army and served in the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers and then in the 12th (Prince of Wales&#x27;s) Royal Lancers, finally as a major.

==Career==
Beresford contested County Waterford unsuccessfully in 1837. He was elected for Harwich in the next general election in 1841, which he represented until 1847. Beresford and Charles Newdegate were the Conservative whips in the House of Commons after the party split over the Corn Laws. His relations with Benjamin Disraeli were strained, with Beresford often taking his cue from Lord Stanley in the Lords instead of the nominal leader in the commons. As Chief Whip he managed the 1852 general election, widely noted for its venality (even by the standards of the day), and was censured by the house for &quot;reckless indifference to systematic bribery&quot;. Disraeli took the opportunity to remove Beresford, who was briefly succeeded as whip by William Forbes Mackenzie. Mackenzie, however, lost his seat for much the same reason, and was in turn succeeded by Sir William Joliffe. The management of elections Disraeli transferred to his solicitor, Philip Rose. Beresford was appointed Secretary at War in 1852, and on this occasion was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor.

==Family==
In 1833, he married Catherine, the youngest daughter of George Robert Heneage, and had by her two sons and a daughter.

<text>Nicholas Raymond Leige Price (born 28 January 1957) is a Zimbabwean former professional golfer who has won three major championships in his career: the PGA Championship twice (in 1992 and 1994) and The Open Championship in 1994. In the mid-1990s, Price reached number one in the Official World Golf Ranking. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Early life==
Price was born in Durban, South Africa. His parents were originally British. His father was English and his mother Welsh. His early life was spent in Rhodesia. For secondary school, he attended Prince Edward School in Salisbury where he captained the golf team. As a teenager, he participated in the 1975 Rhodesian Dunlop Masters and Holiday Inns Invitational, official events on the Southern African Tour.

After his schooling he served in the Rhodesian Air Force during that country&#x27;s Bush War.

== Professional career ==
He began his professional golf career in 1977 on the South African Tour, before moving to the European Tour and finally the PGA Tour in 1983. In 1984, Price renounced his Zimbabwean citizenship and thereafter played under his British passport. It was not until 1996 that Price regained his dual citizenship.

Price&#x27;s first win was at the 1979 Asseng TV Challenge Series on the Southern African Tour. He won his first tournament outside of South Africa at the 1980 Swiss Open on the European Tour. He was still relatively unknown when he finished tied for second with Peter Oosterhuis one shot behind Tom Watson at the 1982 Open Championship after having a three-shot lead with six holes to go. Price also won the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit for the 1982/83 season.

Price earned PGA Tour membership after finishing 3rd place at 1982 PGA Tour Qualifying School. In 1983, Price won his first PGA Tour event with a wire to wire four-shot triumph over Jack Nicklaus at the World Series of Golf. After that win, it would be almost another eight years before Price won again on the PGA Tour. In the interim, Price shot an Augusta National Golf Club course record 63 at the 1986 Masters Tournament and finished second at the 1988 Open Championship to Seve Ballesteros.
By the mid-1990s, Price was regarded as the best player in the world, and in 1994 he won two majors back-to-back, The Open and the PGA Championship, adding to his first major, the 1992 PGA Championship. He topped the PGA Tour money list in 1993 and 1994, setting a new earnings record each time, and spent 43 weeks at number one in the Official World Golf Rankings.

Price would have won the Southern African Tour&#x27;s Order of Merit in 1996/97 if he had met the minimum number of tournaments. In 1993 and 1997, Price was awarded the Vardon Trophy; it is given annually by the PGA of America to the player with the lowest adjusted scoring average with a minimum of 60 rounds.

During his early career and peak, Price was one of the best ball strikers in the game along with his good friend and contemporary Greg Norman (who in 1996 tied Price&#x27;s Augusta National course record of 63).

Like fellow African Gary Player, Price has expressed his distaste for the Ryder Cup, saying of the event, &quot;If you like root canals and hemorrhoids, you&#x27;d love it there.&quot;, but he has played five times as a member of the Presidents Cup.

Although Price continues to play professionally, he has expanded into golf design with his own company operating out of Florida, and he has his own line of signature golf apparel. He is widely regarded by fans, media and his fellow players as one of the most personable golfers on the PGA Tour. He won his first Champions Tour event at the 2009 Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am where he had three double bogeys in his final round, but he hung on to win by two strokes over Larry Nelson.

== Personal life ==
Price is married to Sue and has three children. They live in Hobe Sound, Florida. His nephew Ray Price is a former national cricketer for the Zimbabwe national cricket team.

He is presently a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe.

== Awards and honors ==

* In 2003, Price was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. 
* In 2005, he was voted to be given the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the USGA in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. 
* In 2011, he was bestowed with Old Tom Morris Award, the highest honour given by the GCSAA to an individual who &quot;through a continuing lifetime commitment to the game of golf has helped to mold the welfare of the game in a manner and style exemplified by Old Tom Morris.&quot;

<doc id="1132024" wikidata="Q415997" url="?curid=1132024" title="Ketanserin">
<text>Ketanserin, sold under the brand name Sufrexal, is an antihypertensive agent which is used to treat arterial hypertension and vasospastic disorders. It is also used in scientific research as an antiserotonergic agent in the study of the serotonin system; specifically, the 5-HT2 receptor family. The drug is taken by mouth.
Side effects of ketanserin include dizziness, tiredness, edema, dry mouth, weight gain, and QT interval prolongation. Ketanserin acts as a selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, α1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. It also shows lower affinity for various other targets.
Ketanserin was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1980. It was the first serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to be discovered that showed selectivity over other serotonin receptors. The drug is not available in the United States and is mostly no longer marketed throughout the rest of the world.

==Uses==
===Medical uses===
Ketanserin is classified as an antihypertensive by the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health.

It has been used to reverse pulmonary hypertension caused by protamine (which in turn was administered to reverse the effects of heparin overdose).

The reduction in hypertension is not associated with reflex tachycardia.

It has been used in cardiac surgery.

A 2000 Cochrane Review found that, compared to placebo, ketanserin did not provide significant relief for people suffering from Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon attacks in the setting of progressive systemic sclerosis (an autoimmune disorder). While the frequency of the attacks was unaffected by ketanserin, there was a reduction in the duration of the individual attacks. However, due to the significant adverse effect burden, the authors concluded that ketanserin&#x27;s utility for this indication is likely unbeneficial.

Ketanserin is a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist that was initially developed as an anti-hypertensive medicine. However, now the drug is available as a topical gel formulation for treating wounds, burns, ulcers, and anal fissures. Its action is through the acceleration of epithelialization.

===Research uses===
With tritium (3H) radioactively labeled ketanserin is used as a radioligand for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, e.g. in receptor binding assays and autoradiography. This radio-labeling has enabled the study of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor distribution in the human brain.

An autoradiography study of the human cerebellum has found an increasing binding of 3H-ketanserin with age (from below 50 femtomol per milligram tissue at around 30 years of age to over 100 above 75 years). The same research team found no significant correlation with age in their homogenate binding study.

Ketanserin has also been used with carbon (11C) radioactively labeled NNC112 in order to image cortical D1 receptors without contamination by 5-HT2 receptors.

Increasing research into the use of psychedelics as antidepressants has seen ketanserin used to both block the hallucinogenic experience, and to disentangle the specific cognitive effects of 5-HT2A activation. Ketanserin has been found to block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and ayahuasca (dimethyltryptamine) in clinical studies.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Ketanserin is a high-affinity non-selective antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors in rodents, In addition to the 5-HT2 receptors, ketanserin is also a high affinity antagonist for the H1 receptor. It has also been found to block the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2).

Occupancy of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by ketanserin in humans has been studied.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The bioavailability of ketanserin is 50%. The plasma protein binding of ketanserin is 95.0% and it is mainly bound to albumin. The elimination half-life of ketanserin is 10 to 29hours.

==Chemistry==
===Synthesis===
Either 3-(2-Chloroethyl)quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione [5081-87-8] (1a), or alternatively 2,3-dihydro-[1,3]oxazolo[2,3-b]quinazolin-5-one [52727-44-3] (1b) can be used as starting material. Attachment of the sidechain to 4-(4-Fluorobenzoyl)piperidine [56346-57-7] (2) completes the synthesis of Ketanserin (3).

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Ketanserin&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , . It is also known by its major brand name &quot;Sufrexal&quot; and by its former developmental code names &quot;R-41468&quot;, &quot;KJK-945&quot;, and &quot;R-49945&quot;.

<doc id="1132032" wikidata="Q638519" url="?curid=1132032" title="Wawel Cathedral">
<text>The Wawel Cathedral (), formally titled the Archcathedral Basilica of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Saint Stanislaus]] and [[St. Wenceslas|Saint Wenceslaus]], () is a Catholic cathedral situated on Wawel Hill in Kraków, Poland. Nearly 1000 years old, it is part of the Wawel Castle Complex and is a national sanctuary which served as the coronation site of Polish monarchs.

The current Gothic cathedral is the third edifice on this site; the first was constructed and destroyed in the 11th century and the second one, constructed in the 12th century, was destroyed by a fire in 1305. The construction of the existing church began in the 14th century on the orders of Bishop Nanker. Over time, the building was expanded by successive rulers resulting in its versatile and eclectic architectural composition. There are examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Neogothic elements in the cathedral&#x27;s façade and interior. The exterior is adorned by side chapels and representative mausoleums, most notable being the golden-domed Sigismund&#x27;s Chapel.

It is the official seat of the Archbishop of Kraków and of the Archdiocese of Kraków. A symbol of Polish statehood and faith, the cathedral hosts important religious events and annual celebrations. Karol Wojtyła, who in 1978 became Pope John Paul II, the day after his ordination to the priesthood offered his first Mass as a priest at the Wawel Crypt on 2 November 1946, and was ordained Kraków&#x27;s auxiliary bishop in the cathedral on 28 September 1958.

== Interior ==
The cathedral comprises a nave with aisles, transepts with aisles, a choir with double aisles, and an apse with ambulatory and radiating chapels. The main altar, located in the apse, was founded about 1650 by Bishop Piotr Gembicki and created by Giovanni Battista Gisleni. The altar painting of &quot;Crucified Christ&quot; by Marcin Blechowski is from the 17th century. Over the main altar stands a tall canopy of black marble supported by four pillars, designed by Giovanni Battista Trevano and Matteo Castelli between 1626 and 1629. Underneath the canopy is placed a silver coffin of national patron Stanislaus of Szczepanów (also Stanisław Szczepanowski) created between 1669 and 1671 after the previous one (donated in 1512 by King Sigismund I the Old) was stolen by the Swedes in 1655.
===Sigismund&#x27;s Chapel===

Sigismund&#x27;s Chapel, or Zygmunt Chapel (&quot;Kaplica Zygmuntowska&quot;), adjoining the southern wall of the cathedral, is one of the most notable pieces of architecture in Kraków and perhaps &quot;the purest example of Renaissance architecture outside Italy.&quot; Financed by Sigismund I the Old, it was built between 1517 and 1533 by Bartolommeo Berrecci, a Florentine Renaissance architect, who spent most of his career in Poland.

A square-based chapel with a golden dome, it houses the tombs of its founder and those of his children, King Sigismund II Augustus and Anna Jagiellon (Jagiellonka).
== Royal chapels and crypts ==
The Wawel Cathedral has been the main burial site for Polish monarchs since the 14th century. As such, it has been significantly extended and altered over time as individual rulers have added multiple burial chapels.
The crypts beneath the Wawel Cathedral hold the tombs of Polish kings, national heroes, generals and revolutionaries, including rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth such as John III Sobieski and his consort Marie Casimire (Maria Kazimiera); the remains of Tadeusz Kościuszko, the leader of a Polish national insurrection and Brigadier General in the American Revolutionary War; Władysław Sikorski, Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces; Marshal Józef Piłsudski, founder of the Second Polish Republic. Pope John Paul II celebrated his first mass in St. Leonard&#x27;s Crypt. He considered being buried at the Wawel Cathedral also at one point in time, while some of the people of Poland had hoped that, following ancient custom, his heart would be brought there and kept alongside the remains of the great Polish rulers. (John Paul II was buried under St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a papal burial site since antiquity, instead.)

===Crypt of National Poets===

Two national bards, Adam Mickiewicz (laid to rest there in 1890) and Juliusz Słowacki (1927), are buried at this site.

<text>Media democracy is a democratic approach to media studies that advocates for the reform of mass media to strengthen public service broadcasting and develop participation in alternative media and citizen journalism in order to create a mass media system that informs and empowers all members of society and enhances democratic values.

Media democracy is both a theory and a social movement. It is against concentration in the ownership of media, and it champions diversity of voices and perspectives within the news system.

==Definition==
Media democracy focuses on the empowerment of individual citizens and on the promotion of democratic ideals through the spread of information. Additionally, the approach argues that the media system itself should be democratic in its own construction, shying away from private ownership or intense regulations. Media democracy entails that media should be used to promote democracy and that media itself should be democratic. For example, it views media ownership concentration as undemocratic and as being unable to promote democracy, and thus, as facet of media that must be examined critically. Both the concept and the social movements promoting it have grown in response to the increased corporate domination in mass media and perceived shrinking of the marketplace of ideas. It understands media as a tool with the power to reach a large audience with a central role in shaping culture.

The concept of a media democracy follows in response to the deregulation of broadcast markets and the concentration of mass media ownership. In the book &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot;, authors Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky outline the propaganda model of media, which states that the private interests in control of media outlets shape news and information before it is disseminated to the public through the use of five information filters.

Media democracy gives people the right to participate in media. It extends the media&#x27;s relationship to the public sphere, where the information gathered can be viewed and shared by the people. The relationship of media democracy and the public sphere extends to various types of media, such as social media and mainstream media, in order for people to communicate with one another through digital media and share the information they want to publish to the public.

The term also refers to a modern social movement evident in countries all over the world. It attempts to make mainstream media more accountable to the publics they serve and to create more democratic alternatives to current forms of mass media.

Media democracy advocates for:
* Replacing the current corporate media model with one that operates democratically, rather than for profit;
* Strengthening public service broadcasting;
* Incorporating the use of alternative media into the larger discourse;
* Increasing the role of citizen journalism;
* Turning a passive audience into active participants;
* Using the mass media to promote democratic ideals.

The competitive structure of the mass media landscape stands in opposition to democratic ideals since the competition of the marketplace affects how stories are framed and transmitted to the public. This can &quot;hamper the ability of the democratic system to solve internal social problems as well as international conflicts in an optimal way.&quot;

Media democracy is grounded in creating a mass media system that favours a diversity of voices and opinions over ownership or consolidation, in an effort to eliminate bias in coverage. This, in turn, leads to the informed public debate necessary for a democratic state.
The ability to comprehend and scrutinize the connection between press and democracy is important because media has the power to tell a society&#x27;s stories and thereby influence thinking, beliefs and behaviour.

==Media ownership concentration==
Cultural studies have investigated changes in the increasing tendency of modern mass media in the field of politics to blur and confuse the boundaries between journalism, entertainment, public relations and advertising.
A diverse range of information providers is necessary so that viewers, readers and listeners receive a broad spectrum of information from varying sources that is not tightly controlled, biased and filtered. Access to different sources of information prevents deliberate attempts at misinformation and allows the public to make their own judgments and form their own opinions. This is critical as individuals must be in a position to decide and act autonomously for there to be a functioning democracy.

The last several decades have seen an increased concentration of media ownership by large private entities. In the United States, these organizations are known as the Big Six. They include: General Electric, Walt Disney Co., News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom, and CBS Corporation. A similar approach has been taken in Canada, where most media outlets are owned by national conglomerates. This has led to a reduction in the number of voices and opinions communicated to the public; to an increase in the commercialization of news and information; a reduction in investigative reporting; and an emphasis on infotainment and profitability over informative public discourse.

The concentration of media outlets has been encouraged by government deregulation and neoliberal trade policies. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed most of the media ownership rules that were previously put in place. This led to a massive consolidation of the telecommunications industry. Over 4,000 radio stations were bought out, and minority ownership in TV stations dropped to its lowest point since 1990 when the federal government began tracking the data.

Another aspect of the concentration of media ownership is the nature of the political economy that follows. Some media theorists argue that corporate interest is put forth, and that only the small cluster of media outlets have the privilege of controlling the information that the population can access. Moreover, media democracy claims that corporate ownership and commercial pressures influence media content, sharply limiting the range of news, opinions, and entertainment citizens receive. Consequently, they call for a more equal distribution of economic, social, cultural, and information capital, which would lead to a more informed citizenry, as well as a more enlightened, representative political discourse.

To counter media ownership concentration, advocates of media democracy support media diversification. For instance, they prefer local news sources, for they allow for a greater variety in the ideas being spread thanks to being outside the corporate economy, since diversity is at the root of a fair democracy.

==Internet media democracy==

The World Wide Web, particularly Web 2.0, is seen as a powerful medium for facilitating the growth of a media democracy as it offers participants &quot;a potential voice, a platform, and access to the means of production.&quot; The internet is being utilized as a medium for political activity and other pressing issues such as social, environmental, and economic problems []. Moreover, the utilization of the internet has allowed online users to participate in political discourse freely and increase their democratic presence online and in person.Users share information such as voting polls, dates, locations, and statistics, or information about protests and news that is not yet covered by the media.

The Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa, media was used for democratic purposes and uprisings. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube allowed citizens to connect quickly, exchange information, and organize protests against their governments. While social media is not solely credited with the success of these protests, the technologies played an important role in instilling change in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. These acts show that a population can be informed through alternative media channels and adjust its behaviour accordingly. Individuals who did not have the facility to access these social media platforms were still able to observe news through satellite channels and other people who were able to connect online. Crowdfunded websites are also linked to a heightened spread of media democracy.

The Romanian Election of 2014 [] serves as an example of internet media democracy. During the elections, many took to social media to voice their opinions and share pictures of themselves at polling centres all around the world. This 2014 election is remembered as the first time in which virtual ambition and the use of social media translated positively and directly onto polling numbers. Many Romanians were actively campaigning online through social media platforms, specifically, Facebook, &quot;As more than 7 million Romanians have profiles on at least one social network and more than 70% of that one were active daily, the campaign was focused on the development of the civic participation through internet social networks.&quot;

==Restriction in media==
Restrictions in media may exist either directly or indirectly. Before internet usage of media, as well as social media, became prominent, ordinary citizens rarely had much control over media. Even as the usage of social media has increased, major corporations still maintain the primary control over media as they are acquiring more and more platforms that would be considered in public use today.

Media has been compared in the sense that it is the usage of media that determines how the content is considered, rather than the actual messages of the content. According to Alec Charles edited &quot;Media/Democracy&quot;, “It is not the press or television or the internet or even democracy itself that is good or bad. It is what we do with them that makes them so”.

The role government plays in media restrictions in media has been viewed with skepticism as well. The government involvement in media is possibly due to distrust between the government and media, as the government has criticized media before. Partial blame for distrust between the government and the public on both sides often goes to media as the public may feel as though there is false information though media and the government may feel as though media is giving the public false information.

These functions of media in the way that it exists is described in a review of Victor Pickard&#x27;s book, &quot;America&#x27;s Battle for Media Democracy: The Triumph of Corporate Libertarianism and the Future of Media Reform,&quot; where Josh Shepperd wrote, “If one approaches the historical question of media ownership from a public service model, the private emphasis of the system requires praise for its innovations and self-sustainability, but deserves deep interrogation for its largely uncontested claim that the system, as is, provides the best opportunity for social recognition”.

In his 2005 speech at the NASIG, Leif Utne states that media democracy is related to freedom of press because it contributes to the reciprocal exchange of desires and information between the press, the state, and the population.

== Normative roles of media in democracy ==
Monitorial role

The term is originally coined by Harold Lasswell who associated the monitorial role with surveillance, &quot;observing an extended environment for relevant information about events, conditions, trends, and threats.&quot; This form of media democracy is organized through the scanning of the real world of people, status and events, and potentially relevant sources of information. Under the guidance of relevance, importance, and normative framework that regulates the public domain, such information is evaluated and verified. Staying alert and controlling political power. It provides information to individuals to make their own decisions. The monitorial role involves practices such as publishing reports, agendas, and threats, reporting political, social, and economic decisions, and shedding light to public opinion.

Facilitative role

Media democracy uses journalism as a means to improve the quality of public life and promote democratic forms. It serves as a glue to hold community together. And it also enhances the ability and desire to listen to others.

Radical role

Going to the &quot;root&quot; of power relations and inequality and exposing their negative impacts upon the quality of everyday life and the health of democracy.

Oppositional to commercial/mainstream media which tend to protect the interest of the powerful and fail to provide information that raises critical awareness and generated empowerment. Cultivating political advocacy motivates engaging in political social democracy.

Collaborative role

Collaboration between media and state is always open and transparent.

== Actual roles of media in democracy ==

There is widespread concern that the mass media and social media are not serving the role that a well-functioning democracy. For example, the media is in charge of broadcasting political news to truthfully inform the population, but those messages can have a double purpose (promoting the good of the population and advancing the politicians&#x27; career through public relations), which can make the journalists&#x27; work more difficult. There is a need for the public to be informed about certain issues whether it may be social, political, or environmental. The media is heavily credited for keeping the public informed and up-to-date with activity, however, throughout the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s corporate media has taken over in providing this information.

==Feminism==
Feminist media theories argue that the media cannot be considered truly inclusive or democratic if it continues relying on masculine concepts of impartiality and objectivity. They argue that creating a more inclusive and democratic media requires reconceptualizing how we define the news and its principles. According to some feminist media theorists, news is like fictional genres that impose order and interpretation on its materials by means of narrative. Consequently, the news narrative put forward presents only one angle of a much wider picture.

It is argued that the distinction between public and private information that underpins how we define valuable or appropriate news content is also a gendered concept. The feminist argument follows that the systematic subversion of private or subjective information excludes women&#x27;s voices from the popular discourse. Further to this point, feminist media theorists argue there is an assumed sense of equality implicit in the definition of the public that ignores important differences between genders in terms of their perspectives. So while media democracy in practice as alternative or citizen journalism may allow for greater diversity, these theorists argue that women&#x27;s voices are framed within a masculine structure of objectivity and rationalist thinking.

Despite this criticism, there is an acceptance among some theorists that the blurring of public and private information with the introduction of some new alternative forms of media production (as well as the increase in opportunities for interaction and user-generated content) may signal a positive shift towards a more democratic and inclusive media democracy. Some forms of media democracy in practice (as citizen or alternative journalism) are challenging journalism&#x27;s central tenets (objectivity and impartiality) by rejecting the idea that it is possible to tell a narrative without bias and, more to the point, that it is socially or morally preferable.

== Activism ==
Media Democracy Day, OpenMedia, and NewsWatch Canada are all Canadian initiatives that strive for reforms in the media. They aim to give an equal voice to all interests. Others, such as the creators of the Indonesian television program &quot;Newsdotcom,&quot; focus on increasing the population&#x27;s media literacy rate to make the people more critical of the news they consume.

==Criticism==
The media has given political parties the tools to reach large numbers of people and inform them on key issues ranging from policies to elections. The media can be seen as an enabler for democracy; having better-educated voters would lead to a more legitimate government. However, critics such as Julian King have argued that malicious actors can easily hijack those same tools - both state and non-state - and use them as weapons against people. In the past few years, media has become a direct threat to democracy. Two organizations of the Omidyar Group, Democracy Fund and Omidyar Network assembled to establish the relationship between media and democracy. Their initial findings presented six ways that social media was a direct threat to democracy.

Many social media platforms, such as Facebook, utilize surveillance infrastructure to collect user data and micro-target populations with personalized advertisements. With users leaving digital footprints almost everywhere they go, social media platforms create portfolios of the user to target them with specific advertisements. This leads to the formation of &quot;echo chambers, polarization and hyper-partisanship.&quot; Therefore, social media platforms create bubbles, which are forever growing, of one-sided information and opinions. These bubbles trap the users and diminish opportunities for a healthy discourse. A commonly known effect social media has on democracy is the &quot;spread of false and/or misleading information&quot;. Disinformation and Misinformation is commonly, at scale, spread across social media by both state and private actors, mainly using bots. Each type poses a threat as it floods social media with multiple, competing realities shifting the truth, facts and evidence to the side. Social media follows an algorithm that converts popularity into legitimacy, this is the idea that likes or retweets create validity or mass support. In theory, it creates a distorted system of evaluating information and provides a false representation. It&#x27;s further harder to distinguish who is a troll or a bot. Social media further allows for manipulation by &quot;populist leaders, governments and fringe actors&quot;. &quot;Populist&quot; leaders use platforms such as Twitter, Instagram to communicate with their electorate. However, such platforms allow them to roam freely with no restrictions allowing them to silence the minority voice, showcase momentum for their views or creating the impression of approval. Finally, social media causes the disruption of the public square. Some social media platforms have user policies and technical features that enable unintended consequences, such as hate speech, terrorist appeals, sexual and racial harassment, thus discouraging any civil debates. This leads the targeted groups to opting out of participating in public discourse.
as much as social media has made it easier for the public to receive and access news and entertainment from their devices it has been dangerous in terms of rapid spread of fake news (2019). the public is now easily accessible to those with the intend to spread disinformation information in order to harm and misled the public. those in authority, officials and the elite use their power to dominate the narratives on social media often times to gain their support and misled them.

<doc id="1132047" wikidata="Q865013" url="?curid=1132047" title="Birchenough Bridge">
<text>Birchenough Bridge is the name for both a bridge across the Save River (pronounced Sa&#x27;ve) and a village next to the bridge. Birchenough Bridge is called after Sir Henry Birchenough. Birchenough Bridge is located 62 km from Chipinge in the Manicaland province of Zimbabwe linking Chipinge with Buhera.

==History==
The bridge was funded at a cost of £145 000.00 and planned by the Beit Trust, a foundation chaired at the time by Sir Henry Birchenough whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge. Ralph Freeman, the bridge&#x27;s designer, was also the structural designer on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935. At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time.

In the 1970s a 40-tonne load limit was imposed on the bridge but in 1984 the bridge was widened (roadway: 7.2 m to 10 m wide) and strengthened as part of the World Bank&#x27;s Highway Project One. The village which sprang up next to the bridge has become the centre of a small-scale farming area.

The bridge is widely considered by Zimbabweans as being one of the country&#x27;s finest pieces of engineering, and as such, it appears on the twenty-cent coin. The Zimbabwe Department of Roads has reduced its load capacity not to allow any vehicle weighing more than 25 tonnes. This had reduced business activities in the areas nearby since heavy vehicle trucks will not be allowed to cross the bridge.

<doc id="1132061" wikidata="Q855178" url="?curid=1132061" title="Csángós">
<text>The Csángós (; ) are ethnic Hungarians of Roman Catholic faith living mostly in the Romanian region of Moldavia, especially in Bacău County. The region where the Csángós live in Moldavia is known as Csángó Land. Their traditional language, Csángó, a Hungarian dialect, is currently used by only a minority of the Csángó population group.

Some Csángós also live in Transylvania (around the Ghimeș-Palanca Pass and in the so-called Seven Csángó Villages) and in the village of Oituz in Northern Dobruja.

== Etymology ==
It has been suggested that the name &quot;Csángó&quot; is the present participle of a Hungarian verb meaning ; purportedly a reference to sibilation, in the pronunciation of some Hungarian consonants by &quot;Csángó&quot; people.

Alternative explanations include the Hungarian word , meaning , or the phrase .

The Finnish researcher Yrjö Wichmann believed that probably the name of ceangău (csángó) did not come from a certain Hungarian tribe, but they were called those Transylvanian Szeklers who moved away from their comrades and settled in areas inhabited by Romanians, where they were, both materially and ideologically influenced by them and even Romanized to a certain level. Ion Podea in the &quot;Monograph of Brașov County&quot; of 1938 mentioned that the ethnonym derives from the verb or and means . This was used by the Szeklers in the case of other Romanized Szeklers from the Ciuc area.

In some Hungarian dialects (the one from Transylvanian Plain and the Upper Tisza) , means . In connection with this etymological interpretation, the linguist made an analogy between the verb &quot;to wander&quot; with the ethnonyms &quot;kabars&quot; and &quot;khazars&quot;, which means the same thing.

According to the &quot;Dictionary of the Hungarian Language&quot;, 1862; &quot; The etymological dictionary of the Hungarian language &quot;, Budapest 1967; &quot; The historical dictionary of the Hungarian lexicon from Transylvania &quot;, Bucharest, 1978; &quot; The Explanatory Dictionary of the Hungarian Language &quot;, Hungarian Academy Publishing House, Budapest, 1972; &quot; The new dictionary of regionalisms &quot;, Hungarian Academy Publishing House, Budapest, 1979, the terms , are translated in , .

The historian Nicolae Iorga stated that the term comes from (, with the variants derived from the Hungarian meaning ), name given to the Szekler workers at Târgu Ocna mine.

A theory of the historian Antal Horger relates that the comes from , which refers to a shepherd who walks with the bludgeon after the herds. Another hypothesis of Bernát Munkácsi explains that the term comes from the verb which in Ciuc County means .

== Origins ==

The Hungarian and the international literature in this subject unanimously agree that the Csángós are of Hungarian origin, with varying assimilated elements of Romanian, German, Polish, Italian and Gypsy origin.

Hungarian origins include a mixture of Turkic (Cumans, Pannonian Avars, Khazars, Pechenegs, Székelys), original Hungarian, German and Alan populations.

The Csángós had historically been a rural and agricultural people, raising stock like sheep and cows and farmed crops such as corn, potatoes, and hemp. They were also often called for military service, protecting the Eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages. Before the Communist era and the collectivization efforts, the Csángós were structured in a traditional society until the introduction of civil code. Village elders were well respected and could be pointed out by their traditionally long hair and beards. Notably, some Csángós also participated in the 1907 Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt and fought on behalf of Romania in both world wars.

&quot;Despot was unyielding in punishment, especially against the ones who don&#x27;t respect the sanctity of marriage, -according to the habit of those people-: this habit was copied by the Hungarians and Saxons living here, in this country (Moldavia). He started to build a school in Cotnari, which is mostly inhabited by Hungarians and Saxons.&quot;

=== 2001 Report of the Council of Europe ===

The Council of Europe has expressed its concerns about the situation of the Csángó minority culture, and discussed that the Csángós speak an early form of Hungarian and are associated with ancient traditions, and a great diversity of folk art and culture, which is of exceptional value for Europe. The council also mentioned that (although not everybody agrees on this number) it is thought that between 60,000 and 70,000 people speak the Csángó Hungarian dialect. It has also expressed concerns that despite the provisions of the Romanian law on education, and repeated requests from parents there is no teaching of the Csángó language in the Csángó villages, and, as a consequence, very few Csángós are able to write in their mother tongue. The document also discussed that the Csángós make no political demands, but merely want to be recognized as a distinct culture and demand education and church services in the Csángó dialect.

At the time of this report&#x27;s release, the Vatican expressed hope that the Csángós would be able to celebrate Catholic masses in their liturgical language, Csángó.

==== Comments of the government of Romania, dissenting opinion on behalf of the Romanian delegation ====
The situation of the Csángó community may be understood by taking into consideration the results of the 2002 census. 1,370 persons declared themselves Csángó. Most of them live in Bacău County, Romania, and belong to the Roman Catholic Church. During the last years, some statements identified all Catholics in Bacău County (119.618 persons according to 2002 census) as Csángó. This identification is rejected by most of them, who did identify themselves as Romanians.

The name &quot;Csángó&quot; appeared relatively recently, being used for the first time, in 1780 by Péter Zöld. The name Csángó is used to describe two different ethnic groups:

*those concentrated in the county of Bacău (the southern group) and in the area surrounding the city of Roman (the northern group). We know for certain that these people are not Szeklers. They are Romanian in appearance, and the majority of them speak a Transylvanian dialect of Romanian and live according to Romanian traditions and customs. These characteristics suggest that they are Romanians from Transylvania who have joined the Romanian Catholic population of Moldavia.
*those of Szekler origin, most of whom settled in the valleys of the Trotuş and the Tazlău and, to a lesser extent, of the Siret. Their mother tongue is the same as that spoken by the Szeklers, and they live side by side with Romanians.

=== Hungarian sources ===
Their music shows the characteristic features of Hungarian music and the words of their songs are mostly Hungarian, with some dialect differences.

The anthem of the Csángós refers to Csángó Hungarians multiple times.

The Csángós did not take part in the language reforms of the Age of Enlightenment, or the bourgeois transformation that created the modern consciousness of nationhood (cf. Halász 1992, Kósa 1998). They did not have a noble stratum or intelligentsia (cf. Kósa 1981) that could have fashioned their consciousness as Hungarians (Halász 1992: 11). They were &quot;saved&quot; (Kósa 1998: 339) from &quot;assimilation&quot; with the Romanians by virtue of their Roman Catholic religion, which distinguished them from the majority Greek Orthodox society.

=== Romanian sources ===

Official Romanian censuses in Moldavia indicate the following:

== Controversy ==
=== Hungarian sources ===
In 2001 the Romanian authorities banned the teaching of the Hungarian language in private houses in the village of Cleja, despite the recommendation of the Council of Europe. From 1990, parents in Cleja, Pustiana and Lespezi requested several times that their children have the opportunity of learning the Hungarian language at school, either as an optional language, or as their native language, in 1-4 lessons a week. At best their petition was registered, but in most cases it was ignored. Seeing the possibility of organizing Hungarian courses outside school, they gave up the humiliating process of writing requests without results. The MCSMSZ maintains its standpoint according to which the community should claim their legal rights, but the population is not so determined. Leaders of the school inspectorate in Bacău County, as well as the authorities and church, declared at a meeting that they were opposed to the official instruction of Hungarian in Csángó villages. In their opinion the Csángós are of Romanian origin, and sporadic requests for teaching Hungarian at schools reflect not a real parental demand, but Hungarian nationalist ambitions.

In the village of Arini (Magyarfalu in Hungarian) the village mayor and the Romanian-only teachers of the state school, filed a complaint with the local police about the &quot;unlawful teaching activities&quot; of Gergely Csoma. Csoma teaches Hungarian as an extracurricular activity to the children of Arini. Following the complaint, the local police started what Csángó activists have described as an intimidation campaign among the mothers of those children who are studying their maternal language with the said teacher.

In 2008 members of the European Parliament sent a petition to the European Commission regarding the obstruction of Hungarian language education and the alleged intimidation of Csángó-Hungarian pupils in Valea Mare (Nagypatak). The leader of the High Commission on Minority Affairs responded to the petition of László Tőkés MEP in a written notice that they would warn Romania to secure education in the mother tongue for the Csángós of Moldavia.

=== Romanian sources ===
According to the final report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania in 2006, the policy of assimilation of the communist regime had serious consequences on the situation of the Csángós in Moldavia. The report noted that the first attempts at forced assimilation of the Csángós date back to the interwar period, with the Catholic Church taking on an important role in this process. Facilitating the loss of the linguistic identity of the Csángós allowed the Catholic Church to stop their assimilation into the Orthodox Church, and as a result of these policies, the Csángós did not benefit from religious services and education in their mother tongue.

== Population ==
It is difficult to estimate the exact number of the Csángós because of the elusive nature and multiple factors (ethnicity, religion and language) of Csángó identity.

As far as &quot;ethnic identification&quot; is concerned, in the census of 2002, 4,317 declared themselves Hungarians and 796 declared themselves Csángó in Bacău County, reaching a total of 5,794 out of the county&#x27;s total population of 706,623. The report of the Council of Europe estimates a Csángó population ranging from 20,000 to as many as 260,000, based in the total Catholic population in the area, which may be an exaggeration as there also are Catholic ethnic Romanians. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that many Csángó hide or disguise their true ethnicity.

The Council of Europe had in 2001 estimates that put the total number of Csángó-speaking people between 60,000 and 70,000.

According to the most recent research executed between 2008 and 2010 by Vilmos Tánczos, famous Hungarian folklorist, there has been a sharp decline in the total number of Csángó-speaking people in Eastern Romania. Tánczos set their number to roughly 43,000 people. Moreover, he found out that the most archaic version of Csángó language, the Northern Csángó was known and regularly used by only some 4,000 people, exclusively the older generation above the age of 50. It can be said, therefore, that the Csángó Hungarian dialect is at high risk of extinction. In fact, when applying the UNESCO Framework to measure language vitality, this dialect fits the category of &quot;Severely Endangered&quot;.

<doc id="1132063" wikidata="Q5497295" url="?curid=1132063" title="Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg">
<text>Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg II (September 25, 1887 – January 19, 1980) was a leading architect, an American military and political leader who served as a US Congressman from Pennsylvania, and a member of the Muhlenberg political dynasty.

==Early life and education==
Muhlenberg was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, in Berks County on September 25, 1887. He was the son of Dr. William Frederick and Henrietta Augusta (Muhlenberg) Muhlenberg, a grandson of Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, and a great-great-grandson of Rev. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg.

A 1904 graduate of Reading Boys&#x27; High School, Muhlenberg attended Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1908. Muhlenberg earned his Bachelor of Science in Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1912, followed by his Master of Science from Gettysburg College in 1915, while serving as an officer of the T-Square Club. He received an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1942 from Muhlenberg College of Allentown.

==Military service==
During World War I, he was a captain in the 314th Infantry Regiment serving from September 1917 to March 1919. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart, the Legion of Merit, the Verdun Medal, the Légion d’Honneur and the Croix de Guerre with Palm for his actions in World War I.

Muhlenberg served continuously in the regular army reserves for more than 20 years. He re-entered the United States Army in 1940, where he served during World War II as a lieutenant colonel and colonel in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, as an aide to Gen. Brehon Summervell, and as district engineer in Cincinnati.

==Architecture==

As an architect, Muhlenberg apprenticed with Charles Barton Keen, Magaziner &amp; Potter, and John T. Windrim in Philadelphia. In 1917 he began operating independently, and on May 1, 1919, following his service in World War I, he announced a reopening of his Philadelphia office. In 1920, Muhlenberg joined the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and opened an office of Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Architect, in Reading. He is listed in the Philadelphia city directories as an architect in 1921, 1922 and 1923, with his residential address given as Reading. By the mid-1920s, the practice, now located exclusively in Reading, was thriving. The firm continued through several reorganizations to its present form as Muhlenberg Greene Architects.

During the intervening years, to accommodate the reorganizations, the firm operated for various periods under the following names (dates, in some cases, are approximate):

*Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Architect, 1920–1930
*Muhlenberg &amp; Muhlenberg, 1925–1935
:(Partner was Frederick Hunter Muhlenberg II, previously of Muhlenberg Brothers)
*Muhlenberg, Yerkes, Muhlenberg, 1935–1954
:(Partners were Simeon M. Yerkes and Charles Rick Muhlenberg)
*Muhlenberg and Yerkes, 1954–1959
*Frederick A. Muhlenberg &amp; Associates, 1959–1965
*Muhlenberg-Greene-Veres, 1965–1972
:(Partners were Lawrence A. Greene, Jr. and Elmer Veres)
*Muhlenberg Greene Architects, 1972–1980
*Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd., 1980–present

In the 1950s, Muhlenberg was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

==Politics==
Muhlenberg served on the Reading City Council from 1932–1936, and he was a councilman for the Borough of Wernersville during the 1920s, where he returned to live in his later years. He became the Republican Party chairman for Berks County from 1935–1940.

In 1946, Muhlenberg was elected to the 80th Congress from Pennsylvania. He became the seventh member of his family to be elected to the U.S. Congress, where he served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1947, until January 3, 1949; but he lost a re-election bid in 1948, defeated by Democrat George M. Rhodes.

==Retirement==
In a personal biography he furnished to the &quot;Reading Eagle&quot;, Muhlenberg listed the accomplishments of a &quot;life built on service in four separate careers: architecture, military, social service and political.&quot;

Retiring officially from Muhlenberg Greene Architects in 1977, one week after his 90th birthday, Muhlenberg continued to go to the office daily, until physical limitations prevented him from doing so about a year later. &quot;You can&#x27;t actually retire,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;There really isn&#x27;t any such thing. I don&#x27;t intend to sit on my fanny and do nothing. At 90 years old, you change and have physical limitations. The pace may slow down, but the ideas are still there.&quot;

Muhlenberg died at 92 years of age in Reading on January 19, 1980. As a veteran, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

A collection of awards, military medals, paperwork and other items related to Representative Muhlenberg is held by the Historical Society of Berks County.

==Associations==

Frederick Muhlenberg served as chairman for numerous civic and professional organizations, including the Association of Schuylkill River Municipalities, director of the American Red Cross Berks County Chapter (1929-), chairman of the Red Cross Disaster Relief Commission (1935), the State Board of Examiners of Architects, president of the Social Welfare League (1922–1935), Public Charities Association (1927-), and the State Art Commission (1952–1963). Most notably, he served at the Berks County Planning Commission, leading as chairman from the commission&#x27;s founding in 1954 until 1972 when he retired. In addition, he was a member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board.

Muhlenberg served as commander of Gregg Post, American Legion, in 1924, and a member of General Hunter Liggett Post, No. 38, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Reading Post, No. 10, Disabled American Veterans.

==Awards==
Listed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;, Muhlenberg received scores of educational, civilian, military and social service awards, including:

*&quot;Man of the Year&quot;, Reading Chamber of Commerce, 1960
*&quot;Community Service Award&quot;, Reading Chamber of Commerce, 1967
*&quot;Good Citizenship Award&quot;, Gen. George G. Meade Camp No. 16, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, 1970
*&quot;Silver Bowl&quot;, Manufacturers Association of Berks County, in recognition of outstanding service to the community, 1972
*&quot;Man of the Year&quot;, Rotary Club of Reading, 1975

<doc id="1132068" wikidata="Q1209487" url="?curid=1132068" title="Density altitude">
<text>The density altitude is the altitude relative to standard atmospheric conditions at which the air density would be equal to the indicated air density at the place of observation. In other words, the density altitude is the air density given as a height above mean sea level. The density altitude can also be considered to be the pressure altitude adjusted for a non-standard temperature.

Both an increase in the temperature and a decrease in the atmospheric pressure, and, to a much lesser degree, an increase in the humidity, will cause an increase in the density altitude. In hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be significantly higher than the true altitude.

In aviation, the density altitude is used to assess an aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic performance under certain weather conditions. The lift generated by the aircraft&#x27;s airfoils, and the relation between its indicated airspeed (IAS) and its true airspeed (TAS), are also subject to air-density changes. Furthermore, the power delivered by the aircraft&#x27;s engine is affected by the density and composition of the atmosphere.

==Aircraft safety==

Air density is perhaps the single most important factor affecting aircraft performance. It has a direct bearing on:
* The efficiency of a propeller or rotor – which for a propeller (effectively an airfoil) behaves similarly to lift on a wing.
* The power output of a normally-aspirated engine – the power output depends on the oxygen intake, so the engine output is reduced as the equivalent dry-air density decreases, and it produces even less power as moisture displaces oxygen in more humid conditions.

Aircraft taking off from a “hot and high” airport, such as the Quito Airport or Mexico City, are at a significant aerodynamic disadvantage. The following effects result from a density altitude that is higher than the actual physical altitude:
* An aircraft will accelerate more slowly on takeoff as a result of its reduced power production.
* An aircraft will climb more slowly as a result of its reduced power production.

Due to these performance issues, an aircraft&#x27;s takeoff weight may need to be lowered, or takeoffs may need to be scheduled for cooler times of the day. The wind direction and the runway slope may need to be taken into account.

==Skydiving==

The density altitude is an important factor in skydiving, and one that can be difficult to judge properly, even for experienced skydivers. In addition to the general change in wing efficiency that is common to all aviation, skydiving has additional considerations. There is an increased risk due to the high mobility of jumpers (who will often travel to a drop zone with a completely different density altitude than they are used to, without being made consciously aware of it by the routine of calibrating to QNH/QFE). Another factor is the higher susceptibility to hypoxia at high density altitudes, which, combined especially with the unexpected higher free-fall rate, can create dangerous situations and accidents. Parachutes at higher altitudes fly more aggressively, making their effective area smaller, which is more demanding for a pilot&#x27;s skill and can be especially dangerous for high-performance landings, which require accurate estimates and have a low margin of error before they become dangerous.

==Calculation==

The density altitude can be calculated from the atmospheric pressure and the outside air temperature (assuming dry air) using the following formula:
:formula_1

In this formula,
: formula_2, density altitude in meters (m);
: formula_3, (static) atmospheric pressure;
: formula_4, standard sea-level atmospheric pressure, International Standard Atmosphere (ISA): 1013.25 hectopascals (hPa), or U.S. Standard Atmosphere: 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg);
: formula_5, outside air temperature in kelvins (K);
: formula_6 = 288.15K, ISA sea-level air temperature;
: formula_7 = 0.0065K/m, ISA temperature lapse rate (below 11km);
: formula_8 ≈ 8.3144598J/mol·K, ideal gas constant;
: formula_9 ≈ 9.80665m/s, gravitational acceleration;
: formula_10 ≈ 0.028964kg/mol, molar mass of dry air.

===The National Weather Service (NWS) formula===

The National Weather Service uses the following dry-air approximation to the formula for the density altitude above in its standard:
:formula_11

In this formula,
: formula_12, National Weather Service density altitude in feet (formula_13);
: formula_3, station pressure (static atmospheric pressure) in inches of mercury (inHg);
: formula_5, station temperature (outside air temperature) in degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

Note that the NWS standard specifies that the density altitude should be rounded to the nearest 100ft.

===Approximation formula for calculating the density altitude from the pressure altitude===
This is an easier formula to calculate (with great approximation) the &quot;density altitude&quot; from the &quot;pressure altitude&quot; and the &quot;ISA temperature deviation&quot;:
:formula_16

In this formula,
: formula_17, pressure altitude in feet (ft) formula_18;
: formula_19, atmospheric pressure in millibars (mb) adjusted to mean sea level;
: formula_20, outside air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C);
: formula_21, assuming that the outside air temperature falls at the rate of 1.98°C per 1,000ft of altitude until the tropopause (at ) is reached.

Rounding up 1.98°C to 2°C, this approximation simplifies to become
:formula_22

<text>Brayford Pool is a natural pool formed from a widening of the River Witham in the centre of the city of Lincoln in England. It was used as a port by the Romans – who connected it to the River Trent by constructing the Foss Dyke – and has a long industrial heritage.

Today, the waterfront surrounding the pool is home to a range of hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and a modern University (the University of Lincoln). There is also a year-long programme of events on the waterfront including vehicle displays, music evenings and carnival parades.

==History and profile==
Brayford Pool is the oldest inland harbour in the United Kingdom. The adjacent land is known variably as Brayford Waterfront and Brayford Wharf.

The Pool has been the focus of Lincoln&#x27;s urban regeneration since the early 1990s. It is now overlooked by bars, restaurants, a cinema and, most significantly, the University of Lincoln. The Pool is used as a marina by houseboats and pleasure craft, as well as by anglers and kayakers.

The Brayford Pool is known for its large population of mute swans (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;). The swans made the news in 2004, over concerns about the birds&#x27; diet and overall health, as well as the appearance on the Pool of a number of Australian black swans (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;).

Also located on the Brayford Pool is the Lincoln Unit of the Sea Cadet Corps – T.S. &quot;Wrangler&quot;.

Brayford Island is located in the middle of the Pool.

<doc id="1132096" wikidata="Q1322175" url="?curid=1132096" title="Bill of materials">
<text>A bill of materials or product structure (sometimes bill of material, BOM or associated list) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill of materials is often tied to a production order whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the bill of materials that are in stock and requisitions for components that are not in stock.

The first hierarchical databases were developed for automating bills of materials for manufacturing organizations in the early 1960s. At present, this BOM is used as a database to identify the many parts and their codes in automobile manufacturing companies.

A BOM can also be visually represented by a product structure tree, although they are rarely used in the workplace. For example, one of them is Time-Phased Product Structure where this diagram illustrates the time needed to build or acquire the needed components to assemble the final product. For each product, the time-phased product structure shows the sequence and duration of each operation.

== Structure ==
BOMs are of hierarchical nature, with the top level representing the finished product which may be a sub-assembly or a completed item. BOMs that describe the sub-assemblies are referred to as modular BOMs. An example of this is the NAAMS BOM (North American Automotive Metric Standard) that is used in the automotive industry to list all the components in an assembly line. The structure of the NAAMS BOM is System, Line, Tool, Unit and Detail.

A bill of materials &quot;implosion&quot; links component pieces to a major assembly, while a bill of materials &quot;explosion&quot; breaks apart each assembly or sub-assembly into its component parts.

== Usage ==
In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase &quot;bill of material&quot; (or &quot;BOM&quot;) is frequently used by engineers attributively to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.

In electronics, the BOM represents the list of components used on the printed circuit board (PCB). Once the design of the circuit is completed, the BOM list is passed on to the PCB layout engineer as well as the component engineer who will procure the components required for the design.

== Types ==
A BOM can define products as they are designed (engineering bill of materials), as they are ordered (sales bill of materials), as they are built (manufacturing bill of materials), or as they are maintained (service bill of materials). The different types depend on the business need and use for which they are intended.

Sometimes the term &quot;pseudo-bill of materials&quot; or &quot;pseudo-BOM&quot; is used to refer to a more flexible or simplified version. Often a place-holder part number is used to represent a group of related (usually standard) parts that have common attributes and are interchangeable in the context of this BOM.

A modular BOM (or variant parts list) can be displayed in the following formats:
* A single-level BOM (or unit list) that displays the assembly or sub-assembly with only one level of children. Thus it displays the components directly needed to make the assembly or sub-assembly.
* An indented BOM (or structural parts list) that displays the highest-level item closest to the left margin and the components used in that item indented more to the right.
* Modular (planning) BOM

A single-level BOM resolved to list the effectively needed quantities of components to produce a product (rather than to list each individual part by its logical name) is also called &quot;quantity synopsis parts list&quot;.

===Configurable BOM===
A configurable bill of materials (CBOM) is a form of BOM used by industries that have multiple options and highly configurable products (e.g. telecom systems, data-center hardware (SANS, servers, etc.), PCs, cars).

The CBOM is used to dynamically create &quot;end-items&quot; that a company sells. The benefit of using CBOM structure is that it reduces the work-effort needed to maintain product structures. The configurable BOM is most frequently driven by &quot;configurator&quot; software, however it can be enabled manually (manual maintenance is infrequent because it is unwieldy to manage the number of permutations and combinations of possible configurations). The development of the CBOM is dependent on having a modular BOM structure in place. The modular BOM structure provides the assemblies/sub-systems that can be selected to &quot;configure&quot; an end-item.

While most configurators utilize top-down hierarchical rules syntax to find appropriate modular BOMs, maintenance of very similar BOMs (i.e., only one component is different for various voltages) becomes highly excessive. A newer approach, (bottom-up/rules-based structuring) utilizing a proprietary search engine scheme transversing through selectable componentry at high speeds eliminates the planning modular BOM duplications. The search engine is also used for all combinatorial feature constraints and graphical user interface (GUI) representations to support specification selections.

To decide which assembly variant of the parts or components is to be chosen, they are attributed by the product options which are the characteristic features of the product. If the options of the product build an ideal Boolean algebra, it is possible to describe the connection between parts and product variants with a Boolean expression, which refers to a subset of the set of products.

Parts which will not be assembled at all in one or more variants are typically marked as &quot;DNP&quot; (for &quot;do not populate&quot; or &quot;do not place&quot;) in the affected variants. Other less frequently used designators for this include &quot;NP&quot; (&quot;no placement&quot;, &quot;not placed&quot;), &quot;NF&quot; (&quot;no fit&quot;, &quot;not fitting&quot;), &quot;DNM&quot; (&quot;do not mount&quot;), &quot;NM&quot; (&quot;not mounted&quot;), &quot;NU&quot; (&quot;not used&quot;), &quot;DNI&quot; (&quot;do not install&quot;, &quot;do not insert&quot;), &quot;DNE&quot; (&quot;do not equip&quot;), &quot;DNA&quot; (&quot;do not assemble&quot;), &quot;DNS&quot; (&quot;do not stuff&quot;), &quot;NOFIT&quot; etc.

===Multi-level BOM===
A multi-level bill of materials (BOM), referred to as an indented BOM, is a bill of materials that lists the assemblies, components, and parts required to make a product in a parent-child, top-down method. It provides a display of all items that are in parent-children relationships. When an item is a sub-component, of a (parent) component, it can in-turn have its own child components, and so on. The resulting top-level BOM (item number) would include children; a mix of finished sub-assemblies, various parts and raw materials. A multi-level structure can be illustrated by a tree with several levels. In contrast, a single-level structure only consists of one level of children in components, assemblies and material.

<doc id="1132100" wikidata="Q1474044" url="?curid=1132100" title="Nottingham Panthers">
<text>The Nottingham Panthers are a British professional ice hockey club based in Nottingham, England. They are members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. RHPS are Panthers major sponsor for 2024-25.

The Nottingham Panthers have won four league titles (two English National League titles, one British National League title and one Elite Ice Hockey League title), five Championships, six Autumn Cups and eight Challenge Cups during their history. The Panthers were the first British team to win European club honours with one Continental Cup. They are the only team to have played in every season where a British league championship has been contested and are the only founding member of the Premier Division in 1983 to have continually participated in the top flight league. The Panthers have 16 members enshrined in the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame and have had 34 players represent Great Britain at the World Championships and in Olympic qualifying.

The club was founded in 1946 after earlier attempts to establish a team were postponed due to World War II. During their first eight seasons the Panthers played in the English National League. They joined the newly formed British National League in 1954, which they competed in until its disbandment in 1960. With no league to play in the club also ceased operations. In 1980, players and officials from the Sheffield Lancers relocated to Nottingham and reformed the Panthers. Both the original and modern Nottingham Panthers played their home games at the Ice Stadium until 2000 when the team moved into the National Ice Centre.

The Nottingham Panthers have one of the largest fanbases in British ice hockey, averaging over 5,000 spectators per game during the 2014–15 season. Their supporters have shared a number of rivalries with other teams during their history. Most recently, the Panthers have had a fierce rivalry with the Sheffield Steelers. The two sides have played over 200 games, including eleven major finals, since 1992.

==History==
===1946–60: Original era===
An initial attempt to bring a professional ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following the completion of the Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939–40 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.

The Panthers struggled during their early years and only once during their first four seasons did they finish in the upper half of the league table. The club&#x27;s first coach, Alex Archer, left Nottingham after two seasons and was replaced by Archie Stinchcombe who would coach the team until 1955. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including forwards Les Strongman and Chick Zamick. Zamick became one of the most prolific scorers in the league and won the &quot;Nottingham Sportsman of the Year&quot; award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the Notts County and England international footballer Tommy Lawton.

The club&#x27;s first major title came in the 1950–51 season. After finishing fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won 18 of their 30 league games and clinched the league championship. The team also ended the campaign having scored the most goals and conceded the least. The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury and fell to the bottom of the rankings. Success returned in 1953–54 when, after a last place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers secured their second English League title by one point over Streatham.

In the close season of 1954 the English League and the Scottish League were merged to form a British League. The Panthers finished second to the Harringay Racers in the eleven team competition. After one season all the Scottish teams, with the exception of the Paisley Pirates, withdrew from the British League and left it with only five members. The close season of 1955 also saw the departure of Stinchcombe who was replaced as coach by Zamick. The 1955–56 season proved to be one of the club&#x27;s most successful. Nottingham won the Autumn Cup at the beginning of the season before clinching their third league title on goal average ahead of the Wembley Lions. They also travelled to Sweden where they won the Ahearne Cup.

The 1955–56 title win proved to be the original Panthers&#x27; last. Over the next four years Nottingham alternated between bottom and second place in the league standings. After finishing runner-up in 1959–60, the Panthers took part in the first British Championship final in thirty years where they faced the Brighton Tigers. Nottingham were defeated 3–2 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing overtime. The Tigers clinched the tie 6–5 after six minutes and 32 seconds of the extra session. During the close season of 1960 the British National League collapsed and the Nottingham Panthers were disbanded. Ice hockey would not return to Nottingham for the next two decades.

===1980–present: Modern era===
====Ice Stadium years====
The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely thanks to the efforts of Gary Keward. In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The Sheffield Lancers, a team Keward helped to run, were relocated to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 7–4 at the Ice Stadium.

During their first three seasons the Panthers played in regional leagues, first in the English League South and then in Section B of the British Hockey League. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league&#x27;s Premier Division. The Panthers were one of the best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the Durham Wasps and the Murrayfield Racers. It was not until the appointment of Alex Dampier as coach in 1985 that the team&#x27;s fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs for the first time since reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.

In 1986 Nottingham secured their first trophy since reforming and their first overall in thirty years when they defeated the Fife Flyers 5–4 in overtime to win the Norwich Union Trophy at the NEC in Birmingham in front of a crowd of . Layton Eratt scored the winning goal after one minute and 53 seconds of the extra session in a game that had seen both the Panthers and the Flyers lead twice. In the league Nottingham again succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs but again failed to register a point. The team repeated this in the Championships the following season bringing the number of consecutive playoff defeats to twelve.

In 1988–89 the Panthers enjoyed one of their most successful seasons. They finished third in the league and were not only able to register their first win in the playoffs but also advance to the finals at Wembley for the first time. Nottingham met Whitley Warriors in the semi-final, winning the match 8–6. In the final the following day the Panthers defeated the Ayr Bruins 6–3, clinching their first Championship title. Another Autumn Cup followed in 1991 but Dampier left the club during the 1992–93 season to join the newly formed Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by Kevin Murphy who coached the team for the remainder of the campaign. Murphy was in turn replaced by Mike Blaisdell during the close season of 1993.

Blaisdell assembled a strong team for the 1994–95 season and led the Panthers to the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup with a 7–2 victory over the Cardiff Devils in the final. Nottingham opened their league campaign with a 21-game unbeaten run but four defeats over the final two weekends of the regular season, including an 8–6 home defeat by nearest rivals and eventual champions Sheffield, denied the club their first league championship in 39 years. During the 1995–96 season the Panthers made it to both the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and playoff finals, but they were defeated on each occasion by the Steelers.

In 1996 the Panthers became a founder member of the new Ice Hockey Superleague. The new league abolished the wage cap and restrictions on the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed. Many of Nottingham&#x27;s British players, who had risen through the ranks of the club&#x27;s youth development system, were dropped in favour of North American imports. Of Nottingham&#x27;s locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained. The Panthers began the season by qualifying for the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final for a third straight year following a 6–3 aggregate victory over archrival Sheffield at the semi-final stage. In the final they defeated the Ayr Scottish Eagles 5–3, taking the lead 29 seconds into the game and never relinquishing it. The Panthers finished fourth in the league and qualified for the last four in the playoffs after finishing top of their group with five wins and one overtime loss from six games. Their semi final against the Ayr Scottish Eagles became the longest game in British ice hockey history. The scores were level at 5–5 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten-minute overtime ended goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime, with the two-hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score a shorthanded winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds. In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3–1 after taking an early lead.

In 1997 the Panthers franchise was sold after directors revealed the club was in considerable debt. A buyer was found in London based businessman Neil Black and his sports management company. The 1998–99 season saw the Panthers sign one of their strongest ever line-ups. After finishing third in their Benson &amp; Hedges Cup group, the Panthers eliminated the Slough Jets and Newcastle Riverkings before defeating the Manchester Storm in the semi-final despite being depleted by injuries and facing a full strength Storm side. The final saw the Panthers taking on the Ayr Scottish Eagles in a repeat of the 1996 final. Here Nottingham came from behind to defeat the Eagles 2–1 with Finn Pekka Virta scoring both goals. In the league the Panthers finished in third place, twelve points behind champions Manchester. Nottingham also qualified for the finals of the Challenge Cup and the playoffs but the team were defeated by the Sheffield Steelers and Cardiff Devils respectively. During the course of the season Paul Adey and Greg Hadden scored 141 points between them, four players scored more than 20 goals, six players earned more than 30 assists and seven players achieved 30 or more points.

The 1999–00 season was the club&#x27;s final year at the Ice Stadium before moving to the National Ice Centre. The budget for players was limited by the club chairman so that the Panthers would be able to break even the following season. Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, Mark Kolesar, Eric Dubios and record goalscorer Paul Adey. This frustrated Mike Blaisdell who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach Alex Dampier. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2–1 at London Arena by Mike Blaisdell&#x27;s Steelers. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham&#x27;s last goal at their home of 54 years but the club was defeated 2–1 in overtime.
====Move to the National Ice Centre====
The Panthers moved to the new National Ice Centre in September 2000 but endured a terrible first season in their new home. They were knocked out at the semi-final stage of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup by the Steelers and suffered a dire first half to the regular season. By Christmas the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season with the team winning five of their first seven home games during 2001, including a 6–4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearing brawl. The Panthers still lay in ninth and last place going into their final game of the regular season, three points behind their opponents Newcastle Jesters. Nottingham required a regulation time win to claim the eighth and final playoff berth, something they had not done away from their home ice all season. The Jesters needed only to tie. With 10.1 seconds to go, the game was locked at 2–2, but with an extra attacker the Panthers won a faceoff next to the Newcastle goal and Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take them into the playoffs and eliminate the Jesters. In the playoffs a 5–0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers was their only victory of the post season.

In 2003 the Superleague collapsed after financial problems; it was left with only five members and faced the prospect of having only three. After uncertainty over which league the Panthers would be taking part in and even uncertainty over the future of the club itself, Nottingham became a founding member of the new Elite Ice Hockey League. Changes to the rules regarding the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed to sign saw the Panthers make substantial changes to their squad. After finishing second in the league, their highest finish in twelve years, Panthers qualified for the Challenge Cup final. Their opponent in the two-legged final was archrival Sheffield Steelers, a team that Nottingham had failed to beat in each of the six finals the two club&#x27;s had contested. The first leg ended in a 1–1 tie in Nottingham. In the second leg at Sheffield Arena the Panthers raced to an early 3–1 aggregate lead. However, Sheffield pulled a goal back late in the second period and equalised with ten minutes remaining, forcing overtime. After 53 seconds of the extra session Kim Ahlroos scored the winning goal, ending an eight-year wait for the Panthers to beat the Steelers in a showpiece final and securing the club&#x27;s first silverware since 1998. The Panthers followed up their trophy win with a strong playoff campaign, but after a 6–1 win over the Manchester Phoenix in the semi-final, the Steelers avenged their Challenge Cup defeat with a narrow 2–1 win in the final.

The 2004–05 season saw the club take part in the Continental Cup. The Panthers were placed into a group with host team Gothiques d&#x27;Amiens, Italian side Milano Vipers and Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana. Nottingham tied their first game against Milan before recording 1–0 and 3–1 victories over the Slovenians and French, narrowly missing out on a place in the second round of the competition due to Milan&#x27;s better goal difference. Domestically the team struggled for much of season and only during the end of season playoffs did the Panthers replicate the form they showed in Europe where, despite being depleted by injuries, they qualified for a second successive playoff final, losing 2–1 in overtime to eventual winners Coventry Blaze.

Mike Blaisdell briefly returned to the club as coach for the 2005–06 season, before being succeeded by Mike Ellis. Ellis made numerous changes to the playing staff and led the Panthers to a fifth place league finish. In the playoffs Nottingham eliminated the Sheffield Steelers and Belfast Giants before defeating the Cardiff Devils to clinch their first playoff title in 18 years. All three ties were decided on penalty shots with goaltender Rastislav Rovnianek saving all seven shots he faced during the course of the competition. The following season the Panthers won a second Challenge Cup title, defeating the Sheffield Steelers 9–7 on aggregate in the final. This was the first time that the Panthers had won major honours in successive seasons.

====The Corey Neilson era====
Coach Mike Ellis departed the club following the 2007–08 season, to be replaced by Corey Neilson. After a third-place finish in the 2008–09 season, the Panthers mounted a title challenge during 2009–10, remaining in contention for the championship until the final stages of the season. They eventually finished third for a third successive season. The Panthers also won the Challenge Cup for the second time in three seasons, defeating the Cardiff Devils 8–7 on aggregate in the final. The 2010–11 season started strongly, but the Panthers suffered a poor mid season run which scuppered their chances of winning the regular season title and led to players being fined a proportion of their wages. The team were able to rebound from this, first securing a 4–3 aggregate victory over the Belfast Giants to successfully defend the Challenge Cup, then securing their third playoff championship with a 5–4 win over the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers repeated the double in the 2011–12 season first winning a third straight Challenge Cup with a 10–4 aggregate victory over Belfast. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated Braehead and Hull in the playoffs before winning 2–0 against Cardiff in the final. The game was a tight affair, with David-Alexandre Beauregard breaking the deadlock after 53 goalless minutes.

The 2012 off-season began with the release of captain Danny Meyers and his replacement by fellow Great Britain international Jonathan Weaver. Other new additions included forwards David Ling, Patrick Galivan and Bruce Graham, while Jason Beckett and Eric Werner were brought in as new defencemen. The season began with the Panthers losing 2 of their first 4 home games. This prompted Neilson to re-sign defenceman Guillaume Lepine as well as Anthony Stewart, then of the Carolina Hurricanes, on a short-term deal due to the NHL lockout. Form began to improve and, following a shootout win in Cardiff on 8 December, Panthers went top of the league standings. They remained there for the rest of the season, clinching their first regular season title in 57 years on 15 March 2013. Patrick Galivan scored the championship-sealing goal late in the third period before Matt Francis added an empty-netter in a 5–3 victory over the Belfast Giants. Five days later the Panthers defeated Sheffield 4–1 in the first leg of the Challenge Cup final. This proved decisive, and a 2–1 defeat in the second leg was not enough to deny the Panthers a fourth consecutive Challenge Cup title. Nottingham went on to face Belfast in the playoff final. The Panthers opened a 2–0 lead before the Giants rallied to tie the game and force overtime. On the powerplay in the extra session, captain Jordan Fox scored to give Panthers the win and complete the Grand Slam.

By contrast, the 2013–14 season was plagued by injuries, suspensions and a high turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, a result that left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.

Although a third playoff and Challenge Cup double followed in 2015–16, the remainder of Neilson&#x27;s tenure was highlighted by the club&#x27;s performances in European competition. The club entered the Champions Hockey League in its inaugural season, and, although they were eliminated in the group stage, they did secure a 3–1 victory over the Hamburg Freezers. Two seasons later, the Panthers entered the 2016–17 edition of the Continental Cup. After navigating their way through the first two rounds, the club participated in the final tournament in Ritten, where they won all three of their matches and became the first British team to win a major European tournament. Their victory earned them a place in the 2017–18 Champions Hockey League. Though they were seeded last in the competition, the Panthers produced a major upset by winning four of their six group matches, including a 4–2 win over the fourth-seed SC Bern, to qualify for the tournament&#x27;s knockout stage. They were eliminated in the round of sixteen with a 6–1 aggregate defeat to the ZSC Lions.

====Life after Neilson: Chernomaz to Wallace====
After the departure of Corey Neilson in 2018 the Panthers turned to Rich Chernomaz as their new head coach, but he would be replaced before the end of the 2018-19 EIHL season.

In 2019, the club appointed former player Gui Doucet as Director of Hockey and his first move was to hire former NHLer Tim Wallace as head coach. Wallace had served as player-coach at Milton Keynes Lightning during the 2018–19 season.

The 2019-20 EIHL season prematurely ended in March 2020, without the league campaign being played to its conclusion, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Only the Challenge Cup final was contested, with the subsequent play-offs also cancelled.

On 15 September 2020, the Elite League announced the suspension of the 2020–21 season. The league said restrictions on social distancing and no crowds at sporting venues made the league season non-viable. The season was cancelled completely in February 2021.

On 3 March 2021, Nottingham were announced as one of four Elite League teams taking part in the &#x27;Elite Series&#x27; between April–May 2021, a total of 24 games culminating in a best-of-three play-off final series. Panthers won the tournament on 2 May 2021 courtesy of a 2–0 series win over the Sheffield Steelers, winning game one 5–3 and game two 5–2.

On 5 January 2022, Nottingham parted company with head coach Tim Wallace following a poor run of form that saw the club slip to sixth in the Elite League standings with a 9–10 record. Player/Assistant coach Mark Matheson and captain Stephen Lee were placed in interim charge. The decision to move on from Wallace came just over a week after the passing of Panthers GM Gary Moran.

David Whistle, most recently head coach of Leeds Knights, later joined the interim coaching staff until the end of the season.

====Pacha arrives as CEO; coaching changes====
In May 2022, Nottingham announced they had parted ways with Director of Hockey Gui Doucet after three years in the role. The club subsequently appointed former Dundee Stars head coach and general manager Omar Pacha into a newly created role of chief executive officer.

The same month, Pacha&#x27;s first move of note was to name American Gary Graham as the new Nottingham Panthers head coach. Graham arrived having most recently coached USHL side Omaha Lancers. He was also previously the coach of Pensacola Ice Flyers and Fort Wayne Komets.

However, Nottingham parted company with Graham in November 2022. The team sat sixth in the standings with a 6–8–1 record but had failed to deliver consistent results under Graham&#x27;s leadership. The Panthers then announced that Corey Neilson had returned as head coach until the end of the 2022–23 season. Neilson had previously played with Nottingham from 2006 to 2013 and coached the team from 2008 to 2018.

Nottingham finished the 2022–23 season in 7th place with 47 points and a 21–28–5 record from 54 games, after which Neilson stepped down as head coach to take up an opportunity elsewhere in Europe.

In April 2023, Nottingham confirmed the arrival of Frenchman Jonathan Paredes as the club&#x27;s new head coach from the 2023–24 season. Paredes arrived from French Ligue Magnus side Jokers de Cergy-Pontoise, who he had coached for six years and taken from the French second tier to the upper reaches of the French top division.

On 28 October 2023, during a Challenge Cup game against the Sheffield Steelers, Panthers forward Adam Johnson was fatally injured after an on-ice collision resulted in his throat being slashed by Steelers defenceman Matt Petgrave&#x27;s skate. Immediately following the incident, the game was abandoned and medical personnel attempted to save Johnson&#x27;s life, but to no avail. The incident is currently under police investigation.

Following the incident the Panthers would sign free agent Simon Després, Austin Farley from HC Nove Zamky and young English defender Joseph Hazeldine from the Fehérvár Hockey Academy 19. On 20 November 2023, Swedish defender Viktor Björkung departed the club for HK Spišská Nová Ves.

On 8 November 2023, the Panthers announced that they were withdrawing from the 2023–24 Challenge cup competition. On 26 November 2023, Panthers returned to playing with a 2–4 loss to the Belfast Giants but won their second game back 4–2 against the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers would earn a record of 14–24–8 following the incident.

Nottingham finished the 2023–24 season in 9th narrowly missing the playoffs by 1 point. Their final game of the season was a 3–2 overtime win against the Manchester Storm, however the Fife Flyers and Coventry Blaze winning their final regular season games meant the Panthers would not make the playoffs for the first time in the EIHL era. After the season the club confirmed Paredes would leave after one season in charge, to take up a job in Europe.

====Danny Stewart era====
On 30 April 2024, the Panthers announced the signing of new head coach Danny Stewart, who joined from the Coventry Blaze after eight seasons with the club. On 3 May 2024, Panthers assistant coach Kevin Moore departed to replace Stewart as head coach at the Coventry Blaze.

==Name origins, logos and colours==
The origin of the name Panthers is uncertain. One of the most widely known theories is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue&#x27;s new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.

During the original era the Panthers did not have a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club&#x27;s current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers&#x27; head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers&#x27; head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during the original era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.

The colours used by the original Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with a black and white striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club&#x27;s colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.

The Swedish 2nd tier (Hockeyallsvenskan) club IK Pantern (The Panther Sports Club) from Malmö who have participated on two occasions in the promotion qualifiers to Sweden&#x27;s top flight, were named after Nottingham Panthers. It was founded in 1959, by young car mechanic workers who were fans of Nottingham Panthers after a tour in Scania, where the English team impressed the Scanian boys.

In July 2024, the Panthers unveiled refreshed primary logos ahead of the 2024–25 season. In a similar style to the NHL&#x27;s Florida Panthers, Nottingham&#x27;s home shirt would feature the word &#x27;Panthers&#x27; on the crest. The away shirt would have the name &#x27;Nottingham&#x27; above the logo.

== Stadiums ==
The original home of the Panthers was the Ice Stadium. Built by Sims, Sons and Cooke Ltd, the Ice Stadium was based on the Harringay Arena design and officially opened on 10 April 1939. The building hosted its first game two days later with the Harringay Greyhounds defeating the Harringay Racers 10–6 in a challenge game in front of a crowd of spectators. Though a team playing under the name Nottingham Panthers would play three games during the winter of 1939–40, it would be 1946 before the venue would host a competitive match. During World War II the Ice Stadium served as a makeshift munitions store and morgue. The building reopened on 31 August 1946 and hosted another game between the Greyhounds and Racers before the Panthers made their competitive debut on 22 November, defeating the Wembley Monarchs 3–2. The venue became the home of the team between 1946 and 1960 and again from the club&#x27;s reformation in 1980 to 2000.

The Ice Stadium held a capacity of spectators and had an ice pad measuring by . After the club&#x27;s reformation a second ice pad was installed in 1983. In October 1996 plans were announced by Nottingham City Council to replace the ageing building with a twin-rinked National Ice Centre. Work began on the capacity arena section of the facility in the summer of 1998 and was completed in the spring of 2000. The Panthers played their final game at the Ice Stadium on 22 March 2000. After the game supporters were allowed to dismantle anything easily removable from the interior of the building to take home as souvenirs. The Ice Stadium was demolished soon afterwards to allow for the completion of the new Ice Centre.

The new National Ice Centre was designed by Nottingham City Council officials and was built by John Laing plc. The building cost £40 million to construct, of which £22.5 million was awarded by the National Lottery. The arena half of the facility was opened on 1 April 2000, with the second public skating pad opening a year later. Both rinks are Olympic sized ice pads measuring by . The Panthers played their first game at their new home on 2 September 2000 when the team hosted the London Knights in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Barry Nieckar scored the club&#x27;s first goal in a 2–1 Panthers victory played to a crowd of .

==Honours==
Nottingham&#x27;s first trophy was the English National League regular season title, which it won in 1950–51. The first trophy of the modern era (beginning with the club&#x27;s reformation in 1980) was the Autumn Cup, won in 1986–87. The original club won four major honours (3 regular season titles and 1 Autumn Cup) in 14 seasons, whereas the modern Panthers have secured 21 trophies in 39 seasons (1 Continental Cup, 1 regular season title, 6 playoff championships, 8 Challenge Cups and 5 Autumn Cups).

==Records and statistics==
Randall Weber holds the record for Nottingham Panthers appearances, having played for the club 845 times between 1985 and 2002. Centre Chick Zamick comes second, having appeared 624 times between 1947 and 1958.

Canadian forward Paul Adey is the club&#x27;s all-time leader in goals, assists and points. He scored 828 goals and 781 assists for a total of points in 609 appearances between 1988 and 1999. Zamick is in second place having scored 774 goals and 638 assists for 1412 points. He is the only other player to have amassed more than points for the Panthers. Adey also holds the record for the most goals scored by a Panthers player in a single season with 120 during the 1994–95 season. During the same season Rick Brebant set club records for the most assists and most points in a single season with 156 and 241 respectively.

British forward Simon Hunt holds the club record for the most penalty minutes, serving minutes in 524 appearances between 1988 and 1999. During 2000–01 Barry Nieckar earned 352 penalty minutes, the highest number for a player in a single season.

The club&#x27;s record win came on 31 October 1981 when the Panthers defeated the Southampton Vikings 31–2 at the Ice Stadium. A few weeks earlier, on 4 October, the Panthers had recorded their record away victory with a 23–1 win over the same opposition. The team&#x27;s heaviest defeat came on 20 March 1988 with a 23–1 away defeat at the Whitley Warriors. Nottingham&#x27;s largest home defeat was a 14–2 loss to the Dundee Rockets on 25 February 1984.

The Nottingham Panthers have held continuous membership of British ice hockey&#x27;s highest division since the foundation of the Premier League in 1983 and are the only team to have this distinction. The club are one of the oldest in the Elite Ice Hockey League having been founded eight years after the Fife Flyers, but forty years before the Cardiff Devils.

On 29 December 2011, forward David Clarke became the leading goalscorer in Elite Ice Hockey League history. Clarke scored his 230th goal in all competitions to pass Adam Calder.

In the same game, another milestone was set as David-Alexandre Beauregard reached his 1,000th career point.

On 9 March 2014, David Clarke registered his 600th EIHL point in his career and, in the same game, Corey Neilson also became Nottingham Panthers most successful coach, overtaking Mike Blaisdell.

The Panthers have retired the numbers of seven players since reforming. The number 3 of defenceman Gary Rippingale was retired following his death at the age of eighteen in 1992. Randall Weber, who spent his entire seventeen-year career at the Panthers, had his number 10 retired following his final game for the club in 2002. The number 11 of forward Greg Hadden and the number 22 of the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal, assist and point scorer Paul Adey were retired in 2003. The number 77 of defenceman and head coach Corey Neilson was retired in 2013 on the same night the club were presented with their first league championship trophy since 1956. Upon the announcement of his retirement at the end of the 2017–2018 season, the club announced David Clarkes number 5 would be retired during the 2018–19 season. On 18 November 2023, it was announced that the Panthers will retire the number 47, following the death of Adam Johnson. On 15 December 2024, a ceremony took place before the game against Fife Flyers, where Johnson’s number was formally retired. 

On Wednesday 9 November 2022, Nottingham Panthers CEO Omar Pacha confirmed the club would be hanging up the six retired jerseys above the stage end of the ice at the National Ice Centre. The banner depicting the jerseys was unveiled at the game on 12 November 2022 against Belfast Giants.

Sixteen people who have been associated with the Panthers are members of British ice hockey&#x27;s Hall of Fame. As a member of the Great Britain team that won gold at the 1936 Winter Olympics, Panthers coach Archie Stinchcombe was inducted in 1951. The club&#x27;s first coach, Alex Archer was posthumously elected to the Hall of Fame as a member of the Olympic winning team in 1993. Forward Chick Zamick, who played for the Panthers between 1947 and 1958 and holds the original club&#x27;s records for most goals and most appearances, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1951 while fellow forward and teammate Les Strongman who went on to serve as the modern club&#x27;s coach, secretary and as a club director was inducted in 1987. Coaches Alex Dampier and Mike Blaisdell were inducted in 1995 and 2004 respectively while Paul Adey was inducted in 2006. Former players George Beach, Rick Brebant, Johnny Carlyle, Stephen Cooper, Jack Dryburgh,

<text>Richard Michael Duffy (born 30 August 1985) is a Welsh former professional footballer who is the player-manager at club Congleton Town. A versatile player who can play either on the right or at the centre of defence, he won 13 caps for Wales between 2005 and 2008. He is the younger brother of Robert Duffy.

He began his career at Swansea City, making his debut as a 16-year-old in December 2001, before winning a six-figure sum move to Premier League side Portsmouth in January 2004. He never broke into the first-team picture at Fratton Park and instead enjoyed numerous loan moves at Burnley, Coventry City, and former club Swansea. He switched to Millwall in February 2009 before signing with Exeter City in July 2009. He joined Port Vale in July 2012 and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012–13. He stayed at the club for four years before joining Notts County via Eastleigh in June 2016. He joined Kidsgrove Athletic in August 2019.

He began coaching at Congleton Town in May 2020 and was appointed as the club&#x27;s manager 12 months later. Congleton won the Midland League Premier Division title and Midland League Cup at the end of the 2023–24 season.

==Club career==

===Swansea City===
Duffy began his career at Swansea City, making his senior debut under Colin Addison as a 16-year-old on 8 December 2001, in a 4–1 defeat to Macclesfield Town at Moss Rose; he was a 64th-minute substitute for Michael Howard. However, a bout of spondylosis in his lower back kept him out injured for over a year.

He returned to fitness at the start of the 2003–04 season and soon won a regular place in the first team. He scored his first career goal in a 3–0 home win over Macclesfield on 16 September. Despite only having played 18 Third Division games, the Wales youth international soon began to attract the attention of scouts from bigger clubs, and in January 2004 he was sold to Premier League side Portsmouth on a four-year contract for a six-figure sum (believed to be £300,000). He had forced through the move after rejecting Swansea&#x27;s offer of a three-year contract, despite manager Brian Flynn&#x27;s insistence that he would remain at Vetch Field. Flynn also accused Portsmouth of trying to unsettle the youngster.

===Portsmouth===
Harry Redknapp handed Duffy his Premier League debut at Fratton Park on 1 May 2004, putting him on for Linvoy Primus 22 minutes into a 1–1 draw with Fulham. At the beginning of the 2004–05 season he was loaned out to Steve Cotterill&#x27;s Burnley for four weeks. He gained much admiration from the Burnley fans for his excellent performances, and the loan deal was extended into another month. He scored in the &quot;Clarets&quot; 2–1 win over Leeds United at Elland Road. The young Welshman spent some of his loan spell at Turf Moor playing as a right-winger. He joined fellow Championship side Coventry City on a three-month loan in January 2005, becoming Micky Adams&#x27;s first signing at Highfield Road. He played 15 games for the &quot;Sky Blues&quot;, helping the club to narrowly avoid relegation.

He spent the entirety of the 2005–06 season on loan at Coventry City. He made 34 appearances at the club, helping Coventry to a respectable eighth-place finish. He was also handed a new contract with Portsmouth in March 2006, causing Coventry boss Micky Adams to snipe, &quot;I am sure it will be nice playing in their reserves.&quot; In October 2006, he was loaned to Coventry for the third time, in a deal which was extended until 1 January 2007. This followed the collapse of an expected loan move to Queens Park Rangers. He played 13 games before returning to the South coast. On 10 January, a loan to former club Swansea City was agreed until the end of the 2006–07 season. He featured in 11 League One games for the &quot;Swans&quot;, falling somewhat out of favour after manager Kenny Jackett was replaced by Roberto Martínez.

In March 2008, Duffy rejoined Coventry City for the fourth time on loan until the end of the 2007–08 season. However, he tore a thigh muscle the following month, and was sidelined for the rest of the season. He was told he was free to leave Portsmouth in January 2009, having started just the one game for &quot;Pompey&quot; in five years.

===Millwall===
In February 2009, Duffy joined Kenny Jackett&#x27;s Millwall on a contract until the end of the season. He played 12 League One games for the &quot;Lions&quot;, but was one of ten players released from The Den in May 2009.

===Exeter City===
In July 2009, Duffy signed for newly-promoted League One side Exeter City. He made 44 appearances in the 2009–10 season, picking up a total of 12 yellow cards during the campaign. He made 50 appearances in 2010–11. He again helped Paul Tisdale&#x27;s side to exceed expectations by finishing just three points outside the play-offs. Duffy signed a new one-year contract with the &quot;Grecians&quot; in May 2011. Despite injury concerns, he remained a key player at St James Park in 2011–12, as he played 34 games; despite his efforts the club suffered relegation in 23rd place.

===Port Vale===
Duffy signed a two-year contract with League Two side Port Vale in July 2012; this move reunited him with former Coventry boss Micky Adams. He admitted that having Micky Adams as his manager was the main reason he chose to come to Vale Park. He replaced Adam Yates as Vale&#x27;s preferred right-back at the start of the 2012–13 season, but struggled when he was tried out at centre-back in the Football League Trophy. Vale were promoted at the end of the 2012–13 season, with Duffy putting in 39 appearances.

Duffy returned to the centre-half role alongside Chris Robertson in the 2013–14 season after Liam Chilvers was taken ill in mid-November. He went on to finish the campaign with 30 appearances to his name, helping the club to a ninth-place finish in League One. He signed a new two-year contract in June 2014.

He started the 2014–15 season in a centre-back partnership with Ryan McGivern. He played a total of 29 games throughout the campaign. He started the 2015–16 season competing with Ryan Inniss and Remie Streete for one of two available centre-back places. He impressed manager Rob Page, who praised his organisation skills and fitness levels. His consistency meant that he went on to establish himself as the established centre-back alongside one of Inniss, Streete and McGivern. In February he stated that he hoped to win a new contract in the summer and that he was &quot;in a good place with my family. I&#x27;m settled here&quot;.

===Notts County===
On 27 May 2016, Duffy rejected a new contract at Port Vale and dropped down two divisions to sign a two-year contract with National League club Eastleigh; manager Chris Todd described him as &quot;one of my top targets this summer&quot;. However, four weeks later he had his contract with Eastleigh cancelled so that he could sign a one-year contract with League Two club Notts County. He made 47 appearances across the 2016–17 campaign. In February 2017 he had an appearance-based contract extension clause removed from his contract so that he would be available for selection under new manager Kevin Nolan. Later that month Nolan stated that &quot;he&#x27;s probably been our best player all season&quot;. The next month was included in the EFL Team of the Week after making a &quot;brilliant last-ditch block&quot; to deny Wycombe Wanderers an equalising goal in a 1–0 win.

On 6 February 2018, he played his former club, Swansea City, in the FA Cup, which ended in an 8–1 defeat. Nevertheless, he scored two goals in 43 league appearances to help the &quot;Magpies&quot; to qualify for the play-offs at the end of the 2017–18 campaign. He also filled in as captain during absences by Michael O&#x27;Connor and the &quot;Nottingham Post&quot; reported that he had an &quot;outstanding season&quot;. He was offered new contract by Notts County at the end of the 2017–18 season. He missed three months at the start of the 2018–19 season with a hamstring injury. Speaking in April, manager Neal Ardley stated that &quot;he has been excellent [and] he has been part of the reason why we have looked solid at the back&quot;. County were relegated at the end of the campaign, ending a 131-year stay in the Football League. He was released by Notts County at the end of the 2018–19 season.

===Kidsgrove Athletic===
On 21 August 2019, Duffy joined Northern Premier League Division One South East club Kidsgrove Athletic. Manager Ryan Austin said that &quot;he brings real quality to our squad as well as vast experience. We&#x27;ve been looking for a leader, and an organiser for a long time and, Rich fits that role perfectly&quot;. The 2019–20 season was formally abandoned on 26 March, with all results from the season being expunged, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England.

==International career==
Duffy won four caps for the Wales under-17 team, three caps for the under-19 side, as well as seven caps for the under-21s.

Duffy made his full international debut for Wales at the Liberty Stadium in a goalless draw with Slovenia on 17 August 2005. Manager John Toshack predicted a bright future for the young defender. He then played in a 1–0 defeat to England on 3 September 2005, and was said to have &quot;acquitted himself well on the right&quot;. He further played against Poland four days later, and gave away a penalty for a foul on Kamil Kosowski, which was converted for the only goal of the game.

He featured as a substitute in a 3–2 win over Northern Ireland on 8 October 2005, and in a BBC report was marked 7 out of 10 for his &quot;faultless display&quot; and was noted as having &quot;made some crucial clearances under heavy pressure&quot;. Coming on as a second-half substitute in a goalless draw with Bulgaria on 15 August 2006, he was described as &quot;impressive&quot; in a BBC report. He played 64 minutes of a 2–0 loss to Brazil on 5 September 2006. He later played in the 5–1 defeat to Slovakia on 7 October 2006. He also played the first half of a 4–0 friendly win over Liechtenstein on 14 November 2006.

He was dropped from the squad in May 2007, but made a return in March 2008 for the friendly encounter with Luxembourg. In total he won 13 caps for his country in a three-year international career.

==Style of play==
Duffy could operate as a right-back or at the centre of defence. A player with good leadership skills, he described himself as &quot;a ball-playing centre-half&quot; and has said that &quot;I like to play, not just hump it, and I&#x27;m a good communicator too.&quot;
==Managerial career==
In May 2020, Duffy was appointed as assistant manager to Ryan Austin at North West Counties League Premier Division side Congleton Town. He succeeded Austin as manager on 24 May 2021, who resigned for personal reasons. Duffy also registered as a player. Congleton were crowned Midland League Premier Division champions at the end of the 2023–24 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2023/2024LeagueChampions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Congleton also beat Highgate United 5–1 in the Midland League Cup final.

==Personal life==
Duffy admitted driving under the influence in January 2011 after a &quot;silly mistake&quot; following a meal out with friends; he was banned from driving for 12 months and fined £700. He pledged his support to an Exeter based anti-drink-driving campaign and said that &quot;I can only apologise for my actions. It was the first time I have done this and it will be the last. As a role model, especially to young people, this is not an example I should be setting... It just goes to prove that you can never be sure if you take a risk. I hope people reading this will heed the warning.&quot;

<text>Shaun David Cooper (born 5 October 1983) is an English retired professional footballer. He is currently an assistant manager at club AFC Bournemouth.

==Career==
Cooper was a product of Portsmouth&#x27;s youth system. He made his debut for the club in a 0–0 draw at Crystal Palace in March 2002 and featured in six more games in the remainder of the campaign. However, he failed to break into the first team the next season, as Portsmouth won the Division One title. Despite this he was offered a new two-year contract. He spent most of the 2003–04 season on loan at Leyton Orient, playing nine games.

The next season (2004–05) he was again loaned out, this time to Kidderminster Harriers.

Cooper left the club in June 2005, signing for AFC Bournemouth on a free transfer. After spending seven years at the club, he was offered a new contract at a reduced wage by new manager Paul Groves; turning this down, he left the club.

On 25 June 2012, Cooper joined Crawley Town on a free transfer. Six months later, he joined Portsmouth on loan. He scored his first goal for Portsmouth on 13 April 2013, against Brentford. It was subsequently confirmed that his contract with Crawley would not be renewed at the end of the season, and Cooper thus became a free agent.
In July 2013, he had a trial at Torquay United, but failed to earn a contract.

Cooper re-joined Portsmouth until January 2014 on 5 September 2013, for his third spell with the club.

On 9 January 2014 Portsmouth confirmed that Cooper had left the club following the expiration of his short-term contract.

On 17 January 2014, Cooper signed for Torquay United on a potential 18-month contract.

Cooper&#x27;s contract with Torquay United was cancelled by mutual consent in July 2014.

Cooper switched to Sutton United for the 2014/15 season and signed on a month&#x27;s loan to Eastbourne Borough in September 2016.

<text>Multivac is a fictional supercomputer appearing in over a dozen science fiction stories by American writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov&#x27;s depiction of Multivac, a mainframe computer accessible by terminal, originally by specialists using machine code and later by any user, and used for directing the global economy and humanity&#x27;s development, has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period (1950s–1960s). Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL 9000.

== Description ==
Like most of the technologies Asimov describes in his fiction, Multivac&#x27;s exact specifications vary among appearances. In all cases, it is a government-run computer that answers questions posed using natural language, and it is usually buried deep underground for security purposes. According to his autobiography &quot;In Memory Yet Green&quot;, Asimov coined the name in imitation of UNIVAC, an early mainframe computer. Asimov had assumed the name &quot;Univac&quot; denoted a computer with a single vacuum tube (it actually is an acronym for &quot;Universal Automatic Computer&quot;), and on the basis that a computer with many such tubes would be more powerful, called his fictional computer &quot;Multivac&quot;. His later short story &quot;The Last Question&quot;, however, expands the &quot;AC&quot; suffix to be &quot;analog computer&quot;. However, Asimov never settles on a particular size for the computer (except for mentioning it is very large):86 or the supporting facilities around it. In the short story &quot;Franchise&quot; it is described as half a mile long (~800 meters) and three stories high, at least as far as the general public knows, while &quot;All the Troubles of the World&quot; states it fills all of Washington D.C.. There are frequent mentions of corridors and people inside Multivac. Unlike the artificial intelligences portrayed in his &quot;Robot&quot; series, Multivac&#x27;s early interface is mechanized and impersonal, consisting of complex command consoles few humans can operate. In &quot;The Last Question&quot;, Multivac is shown as having a life of many thousands of years, growing ever more enormous with each section of the story, which can explain its different reported sizes as occurring further down the internal timeline of the overarching story.:20

==Storylines==
Multivac appeared in over a dozen science fiction stories by American writer Isaac Asimov, some of which have entered the popular imagination. In the early Multivac story, &quot;Franchise&quot;, Multivac chooses a single &quot;most representative&quot; person from the population of the United States, whom the computer then interrogates to determine the country&#x27;s overall orientation. All elected offices are then filled by the candidates the computer calculates as acceptable to the populace. Asimov wrote this story as the logical culmination – and/or possibly the &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; – of UNIVAC&#x27;s ability to forecast election results from small samples.

In possibly the most famous Multivac story, &quot;The Last Question&quot;, two slightly drunken technicians ask Multivac if humanity can reverse the increase of entropy. Multivac fails, displaying the error message &quot;INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER&quot;. The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally the universe dies. At that point Multivac&#x27;s final successor, the Cosmic AC (which exists entirely in hyperspace) has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Cosmic AC drew all of humanity into hyperspace in order to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Cosmic AC &quot;did&quot; decipher the answer, announcing &quot;Let there be light!&quot; and essentially ascending to the state of the God of the Old Testament. Asimov claimed this to be the favorite of his stories.

In &quot;All the Troubles of the World&quot;, the version of Multivac depicted reveals a very unexpected problem. Having had the weight of the whole of humanity&#x27;s problems on its figurative shoulders for ages it has grown tired, and it sets plans in motion to cause its own death.

== Significance ==
Asimov&#x27;s depiction of Multivac has been seen as the defining conceptualization of the genre of computers for the period, just as his development of robots defined a subsequent generation of thinking machines, and Multivac has been described as the direct ancestor of HAL 9000. Though the technology initially depended on bulky vacuum tubes, the concept – that all information could be contained on computer(s) and accessed from a domestic terminal – constitutes an early reference to the possibility of the Internet (as in &quot;Anniversary&quot;). Multivac has been considered within the context of public access information systems and used in teaching computer science, as well as with regard to the nature of an electoral democracy, as its influence over global democracy and the directed economy increased (&quot;Franchise&quot;). Asimov stories featuring Multivac have also been taught in literature classes. In AI control terms, Multivac has been described as both an &quot;oracle&quot; and a &quot;nanny&quot;.

<doc id="1132127" wikidata="Q332633" url="?curid=1132127" title="William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford">
<text>William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford, (; 2 October 1768 – 8 January 1854) was a British army officer and politician. A general in the British Army and a Marshal in the Portuguese Army, he fought alongside the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War and held the office of Master-General of the Ordnance in 1828 in the First Wellington ministry. He led the 1806 failed British invasion of Buenos Aires.

==Early life==
William Beresford was born on 2 October 1768, the illegitimate son of George Beresford, 2nd Earl of Tyrone. Beresford received his early education in Yorkshire before in 1785 he was sent to Strasbourg, where he attended a French military academy.

==Early campaign experience==
Having spent several months at the military academy, on 27 August the same year Beresford joined the British Army as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot. Beresford was initially stationed with his regiment in Ireland, before in 1786 he travelled with it to join the garrison in Nova Scotia. While on a hunting excursion there an accident resulted in him being blinded in his left eye and scarred on the face. Beresford continued on with the 6th in Nova Scotia after this, before on 25 June 1789 he was promoted to lieutenant in the 16th Regiment of Foot.

Beresford was then promoted to captain on the unattached list of the army on 24 January 1791, subsequently joining the 69th Regiment of Foot in Ireland on 31 May. When the French Revolutionary Wars began in February 1793, Beresford and his regiment were seconded as marines to the Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy. In this capacity he served through the Siege of Toulon between August and December. Still with the fleet, Beresford then formed part of the force that invaded Corsica in February 1794 alongside a group of Corsican patriots. A naval bombardment failed to destroy the French-held Torra di Mortella, and so Beresford led a storming party ashore that captured the tower from the landward side. The impressive defence of the position led to the British adopting the Martello Tower themselves.

Subsequent to this Beresford was promoted to major on 1 March and then lieutenant-colonel on 11 August, in command of the 124th Regiment of Foot, a regiment raised from his father&#x27;s Waterford estates. The 124th was disbanded in the following year and Beresford instead joined the 88th Regiment of Foot on 16 September. He sailed with the 88th to join the West Indies Campaign in November 1796, but his convoy was dispersed by a storm and only three of the 88th&#x27;s companies, alongside the surgeon James McGrigor, reached the West Indies. Beresford and the rest of the regiment were sent to garrison Jersey, where they stayed for the next three years. On 1 January 1800 Beresford was promoted to colonel and the 88th was ordered out to India, landing at Bombay later in the year.

Beresford&#x27;s regiment was sent to Egypt in 1801 to fight in the Egypt Campaign, serving from March to October when hostilities ended. The Peace of Amiens ended in May 1803 and the Napoleonic Wars began, and on 11 February 1804 Beresford was appointed a brigadier-general. The Cape of Good Hope, previously occupied by the British, had been given back to the Dutch in the peace. Beresford was part of the force that recaptured it at the Battle of Blaauwberg in January 1806, commanding a detachment that landed north of Cape Town.

From there, he crossed the South Atlantic to South America to invade the River Plate region (now Argentina), with a small British force of 1,500 men, departing on 14April 1806. Following his move to Cape Town in Cape Colony, Beresford, spurred on by Home Popham, R.N. (later Rear Admiral Sir Home Popham), decided to attack Buenos Aires in Spanish South America. No attempt was made to gain authorisation from the Crown for this undertaking. In the invasion of the River Plate, Buenos Aires was occupied for 46 days. However, the British force could not maintain itself against the army gathered by Santiago de Liniers. After a relentless two-day fight with the Buenos Aires and Montevideo militias between 10 and 12 August 1806, the British were defeated and forced to capitulate. Beresford had to surrender, remaining prisoner for six months; in the end, he managed to escape and arrived in England in 1807.

==Peninsular War==
===Commander in Chief of the Portuguese Army===
In that same year Beresford was sent to Madeira, which he occupied in name of Queen Maria I of Portugal, remaining there for six months as Governor and Commander in Chief. The exiled Portuguese Government in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, whereto the Portuguese Royal Family had set up a court in exile, realised the necessity of appointing a commander-in-chief capable of training, equipping and disciplining the demoralised Portuguese Royal Army. The Portuguese government asked Britain to appoint Arthur Wellesley to this role, Wellesley indicated he could not do the role justice due to his prior engagements and recommended Beresford. He was appointed Marshal and Commander in Chief of the Army by Decree of 7 March 1809 and took the command on 15th of the same month. At that time, French Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult had already crossed into Portugal where he occupied Porto. Beresford quickly overhauled the Portuguese forces, bringing them in line with British discipline and organization, and from the General Headquarters (then at the &quot;Largo do Calhariz&quot;), he dispatched many &quot;daily orders&quot; altering points of the infantry ordnance, creating a general command of artillery, establishing the separation of the battalions, firing incompetent or corrupt officers and promoting or appointing appropriate replacements.

===On campaign===
On 22 April 1809 Sir Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington, disembarked in Lisbon, and took over the command of all the Anglo-Portuguese troops whereupon Beresford was nominated commander of the Portuguese Army. The allied armies marched to the North. Wellington moved from Coimbra directly to Porto, which he entered on 12 May, and Beresford marched through the Province of Beira, arriving that same day at the banks of the Douro river, in the area of Lamego. Wellington&#x27;s troops made a forced crossing of the Douro and defeated the French, forcing Marshal Soult to withdraw from Porto. Soult was outnumbered and expelled from Portugal; the positioning of Beresford&#x27;s forces compelled the French to leave Portugal by the poor roads through Montalegre. They managed to cross the border only after sacrificing their artillery and baggage, and faced numerous difficulties during the evacuation.

The Second French Invasion of Portugal was defeated and the allied armies moved back to the South, the British concentrating at Abrantes and the Portuguese at Castelo Branco. With the intention of cooperating with the Spanish against Marshal Claude Victor-Perrin, duc de Bellune, the Anglo-Portuguese forces under Wellesley moved into Spain in the Talavera campaign while Beresford remained on the Águeda river covering the Spanish-Portuguese border. After Wellesley&#x27;s return, now as Viscount Wellington, following the Battle of Talavera, Beresford re-entered Portugal, where he distributed the army at various locations and established his General Headquarters in Lisbon. From Lisbon he dispatched numerous orders and instructions for the reform of the Portuguese military.

In the same year (1809), and the one following he made tours of inspection of the corps that were found quartered in the various provinces and he corrected any defects he noticed and established rules for the functioning of the different branches of the military service. In this way he improved the functioning of the Portuguese Army so that they might face the forces of Napoleon invading the country for the third time. The beneficial results of his efforts were proven at the campaign against Marshal André Masséna in particular at the Battle of Buçaco on 27September 1810 where the Portuguese troops played a prominent part, and also in the defence of the Lines of Torres Vedras).
The most notable action in which Beresford held independent command occurred in 1811 when a combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish army under his command, intercepted a French army commanded by Marshal Soult, who had been ordered by Marshal Auguste de Marmont to move to protect the important Spanish fortress-city of Badajoz. As the French forces retreated from the Lines of Torres Vedras, Beresford marched towards Badajoz, which he laid siege to. Having, however, received notice that Soult was approaching, he lifted the siege and posted his army at Albuera in a defensive position. There he defeated the French forces on 16 May 1811. After the bloody Battle of Albuera the French were forced to retreat, though the siege of Badajoz had to be subsequently abandoned. Meanwhile, on 13 May 1811, he was created Count of Trancoso in Portugal by decree of Prince Regent John.

At the beginning of July 1811, Beresford was again in Lisbon, but he was subjected to fits of &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot;, as described by Brigadier Benjamin D&#x27;Urban, Quartermaster-general of the Portuguese Army. He recuperated in February 1812 and then joined Wellington in his investment of Ciudad Rodrigo. Once the fortified town had fallen, he went with the army to Alentejo, and participated in the Anglo-Portuguese Siege of Badajoz. After Badajoz had been stormed, along with Wellington he once again took up position on the Águeda, and from there launched the Salamanca campaign. On 22 July 1812, the important Battle of Salamanca was fought, giving the Anglo-Portuguese forces a decisive victory over the French under Marshal Marmont. In the battle Beresford was badly wounded under his left breast while ordering the advance of one of the Portuguese brigades.

He retired to Lisbon, had bouts of fever and was half incapacitated for several months until May of the next year (1813). Meanwhile, he was also created Marquis of Campo Maior in Portugal by Prince Regent John on 17 December 1812. In March he was confirmed as second in command of the Allied Army and re-joined the campaigning army before assisting in the liberation of Spain by the British and Portuguese armies.

In the invasion of France, he assisted Wellington at the command of a corps and was hailed as the liberator of Bordeaux. He fought in France at Toulouse, the last clash of the Peninsular War. During that conflict he had been present at the battles of A Coruña, Busaco, Albuera, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. His Peninsular Gold Medal had seven clasps - only the Duke of Wellington, with nine clasps, had more to his medal.

==Later career==

After peace was declared he went to England on leave and came back again to Lisbon to reassume the command of the Portuguese Army. He did not limit himself, however, to that role, and intended to intervene in the general politics of the country, from this he came into conflict with the Regency. He then determined to go to the Court in Rio de Janeiro. He departed there in August 1815 and returned in September 1816, invested with wider powers than the ones which he had previously enjoyed. Beresford took a high hand in his dealings with Gomes Freire de Andrade (1817) and, put into a difficult situation, he returned to Brazil, obtaining from John VI the confirmation of the powers he had already attained, which he desired to see amplified.

When he returned to Portugal, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 intervened; the British officers, for the most part, had been discharged, and the government would not even consent that Beresford could disembark.
He was made Governor of Jersey in 1821 and held the position till 1854, the last titular Governor of Jersey; since his death the Crown has been represented in Jersey by the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey.

He was given the colonelcy of three regiments in succession. He was Colonel of the 69th (South Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot from 1807 to 1819, the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) from 1819 to 1823 and the 16th (Bedfordshire) Regiment from 1823 until his death. Briefly returning to Portugal in November 1826 at the request of the Regent, Infanta Isabel Maria of Braganza, he gave up his ambitions because of the resistance he encountered among the new Portuguese elite and returned to Britain in February 1827.

In the 1840s, Beresford expanded the Bedgebury Estate near Goudhurst, Kent. He built the hamlet of Kilndown to the north west of Bedgebury.

==Legacy==

Napier, in his &quot;History of the Peninsular War&quot;, severely criticised the tactics of Beresford at the Battle of Albuera, which gave origin to a heated correspondence between the Marshal and the historian. The published letters of Beresford which are mentioned below refer to this controversy. Wellington himself had no illusions over Beresford&#x27;s ability as a General, but he appreciated his abilities as a military organiser, and recommended that Beresford should take command if he himself were disabled. He published: &quot;Strictures on Certain Passages of L. Col. Napier&#x27;s History of Peninsular War&quot;; &quot;Further Strictures&quot;; &quot;Refutation of Col. Napier&#x27;s Justification&quot;, London, 1831–1834, 3 Vol.; &quot;Letter to Charles Edward Long, Esq. on the Extracts Recently Published from the Ms. Journal and Private Correspondence of the Late Lieut-Gen. R. B. Long&quot;, London, John Murray, 1833; &quot;A Second Letter to Charles Edward Long, Esq. on the Ms. Journal and Private Correspondence of the Late Lieut. General R. B. Long&quot; (1834). Also of interest is the &quot;Colecção das Ordens do Dia&quot; (Collection of Orders of the Day) produced by Beresford&#x27;s general headquarters &quot;nos Anos de 1809 a 1823&quot; (for the years 1809 to 1823), Lisbon, 13 Vol. (at the Library of the English Institute of the University of Coimbra).

As a reward for his services in the fight against the French he was raised to the peerage as Baron Beresford, of Albuera and Dungarvan in the County of Waterford, on 3 May 1814. On 28 March 1823 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Beresford, of Beresford in the County of Stafford. Beside many national and foreign honours and decorations he received the Grand Cross of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword. Some authors infer that he also had the title of 1st Duke of Elvas; but no document recording the granting this title is extant. Beresford County, New South Wales, Australia was named in his honour.

He is the namesake of Beresford, New Brunswick.

== Parliament ==
Beresford was Member of Parliament (MP) for County Waterford from a by-election on 28 June 1811 to 25 April 1814, just before being raised to his peerage.

He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1821.

==Family==
In Portugal, Beresford had a romantic involvement with his military secretary António Lemos Pereira de Lacerda and his wife Dona Maria da Luz Willoughby da Silveira. The three lived together in Palácio da Ega, nowadays housing the Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino. Beresford recognised two of Maria&#x27;s children, Guilherme (1812) and Maria Effigenia (1816). He also had a child with an unknown mother, Maria (1818).

Lord Beresford married his first cousin the Honourable Louisa, widow of Thomas Hope and daughter of William Beresford, 1st Baron Decies and Elizabeth Fitzgibbon, in 1832. The marriage was childless. She died in July 1851. Lord Beresford died in January 1854, aged 85. The barony and viscountcy became extinct on his death. His estates were passed on to his stepson, Alexander Beresford Hope. Beresford&#x27;s Portuguese titles were not renewed, although his nephews continued using them.

<doc id="1132131" wikidata="Q7985046" url="?curid=1132131" title="West End (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>The West End is a neighborhood in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., bounded by K Street NW to the south, Rock Creek Park to the west and north, and New Hampshire Avenue NW and 23rd Street NW to the east. The West End is so named because it was the westernmost part of the original L&#x27;Enfant Plan for the city of Washington, before the annexation of Georgetown. It is home to the embassies of Spain and Qatar as well as the Delegation of the European Union to the United States. The George Washington University and George Washington University Hospital are on the edge of the West End, at Washington Circle.

The West End is home to numerous luxury hotels, upscale condominiums, and fine dining restaurants. The neighborhood exists due in large part to a 1972 urban renewal plan prepared by the city&#x27;s Office of Planning and Management, designed &quot;to bring life to a declining part of the city.&quot; Titled &quot;New Town for the West End,&quot; the aerial photograph on the cover of the study showed the area that was planned to become a &quot;new intown community.&quot;

The neighborhood is adjacent to Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, and the city&#x27;s traditional Downtown. Today, DC Planning Office considers the West End part of a more broadly-defined Downtown.

==History==

Historically, West End was a predominantly African American community with brick Victorian rowhouses and warehouses.

Jazz pianist and composer Duke Ellington was born in the neighborhood in 1899.

==Recent developments==

The West End has been a hotbed of development, with hundreds of new luxury condominiums either under construction or in the planning phase.

In 2007, controversy began over the last remaining &quot;underdeveloped&quot; parcel of land, known as Square 37. Bordered by 23rd Street, 24th Street, L Street, and an alleyway, this anomaly, composed of low-rise buildings from the 1800s to the 1960s, stands out amid a sea of new luxury highrises. Square 37 was home to the Tiverton, the last remaining rent-controlled apartment building in the West End. The Tiverton tenants gained local media attention for successfully battling two upzoning attempts by developers in an effort to maintain the square as-is. Trader Joe&#x27;s grocery store opened in the neighborhood in September 2006, next to the former Columbia Hospital for Women, now a luxury condominium.

The D.C. Council passed controversial emergency legislation in 2007 to sell the West End public library branch, the D.C. Special Operations Police Station (both on Square 37), and a firehouse (on neighboring Square 50) to the developer Eastbanc. A new West End Neighborhood Library opened in 2017.

==Education==
District of Columbia Public Schools operates John Francis Education Campus at 2425 N Street.

<text>It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie is a 2002 American musical fantasy comedy television film directed by Kirk R. Thatcher and written by Tom Martin and Jim Lewis. The film premiered November 29, 2002 on NBC and is the first television film featuring the Muppets.

It stars Muppet performers Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, and Eric Jacobson, as well as Dave Arquette, Joan Cusack, Matthew Lillard, William H. Macy, and Whoopi Goldberg. The plot centers on Kermit the Frog who, after losing all hope for saving the Muppet Theatre, is assisted by an angel who shows him a world in which he was never born. The film is a homage to Frank Capra&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, which has a similar plot.

This was the first Muppets production without the involvement of veteran performer Frank Oz. Instead, Eric Jacobson performed Oz&#x27;s characters Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and Animal, marking his feature film debut as those characters.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; is the final Muppets production before the characters and franchise were acquired in 2004 by The Walt Disney Company from The Jim Henson Company. It is one of the few Muppets-related productions that are currently not owned by The Walt Disney Company, and along with &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, is currently owned by NBCUniversal.

==Plot==
During the holiday season, the Muppet Theater is going through financial hardship, and the Muppets are seeking Kermit the Frog for guidance. Kermit eventually feels he is not useful to anyone and an angel named Daniel brings this up with his Boss as they review what has gone on with Kermit in the past hours.

Hours earlier, Kermit prepares a Christmas show with his fellow Muppets with Bobo the Bear playing Santa Claus. Kermit is approached by Rachel Bitterman, a banker/real estate agent who says she will foreclose the Muppet Theater if Kermit does not pay her. Pepe the King Prawn leaves the Muppets because he has fallen in love with Bitterman. Miss Piggy leaves the Muppets to go and work in Hollywood. While trying to raise money to pay Bitterman, Kermit tries to find a celebrity to participate in his Christmas play to no avail. Kermit travels out to California and retrieves Miss Piggy, who gets fired working as an extra on the TV series &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

Meanwhile, after learning from Pepe that the deadline is midnight, Bitterman changes it to 6:00 p.m. Pepe overhears this and sets about informing Kermit about the deadline change, but Pepe keeps being interrupted. The Muppets perform their Christmas musical &quot;Moulin Scrooge&quot; (a parody of the 2001 film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;) and Pepe continues trying to talk to Kermit. The musical is a success, concluding with a standing ovation. After the show, Pepe finally explains to Kermit that the deadline has changed and shows him the contract. Kermit sends Fozzie to deliver the money to Bitterman. Fozzie confronts a crazed nature-show host (spoofing Steve Irwin), before being dyed green at a Christmas tree lot and mistaken for the Grinch by a gang of angry residents of &quot;Whatville&quot;. Fozzie goes through a steam bath and ends up back to normal. When Fozzie eventually makes it to the bank and Bitterman&#x27;s office, he goes through a gigantic web of burning lasers leading to Bitterman&#x27;s office several times before finally discovering that he is too late and that he has grabbed the wrong bag containing clothes for the Salvation Army following his incident at the Christmas tree lot.

After witnessing these events, the Boss allows Daniel to help Kermit. When Daniel arrives, and after Kermit wishes he has never been born, he ends up showing Kermit what would have happened if he had not existed. In the world without Kermit, Bitterman has turned the park near the Muppet Theater into a shopping mall called Bitterman Plaza, the Muppet Theater itself has become a nightclub called Club Dot owned by Bitterman, Doc Hopper&#x27;s French-Fried Frog Legs (first seen in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;) has become a famous fast-food restaurant, and all of Kermit&#x27;s friends have fallen into various detrimental situations.

Kermit has Daniel restore him back to his reality and returns to the Muppet Theater. However, Bitterman arrives to shut the theater down and fights with Miss Piggy. Pepe arrives and announces he has made the Muppet Theater into a historical landmark, foiling Bitterman&#x27;s plans. Defeated, Bitterman storms out of the Muppet Theater.

Outside, the Muppets sing &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 83% approval rating. Barbara Schultz of Common Sense Media rated it 4 out of 5, describing it as a &quot;classic story retold in funny, touching Muppet romp.&quot; On IMDb, the film has a rating of 6.3 out of 10, based on approximately 4,800 user ratings.

==Production notes==
Veteran Muppet performer Jerry Nelson was in poor health during filming, resulting in most of his characters being puppeteered on set by others and later dubbed by Nelson in post-production. The sole exception was Lew Zealand, Nelson&#x27;s character, who was performed by Bill Barretta. Sam Eagle, originally performed by Frank Oz, was voiced in the film by Kevin Clash, with John Kennedy handling the on-set puppetry.

Scooter, performed in this film by Brian Henson, makes his first significant appearance since the passing of his original performer, Richard Hunt. Another of Hunt&#x27;s characters, Janice, is also performed by Henson and has her first speaking role since Hunt&#x27;s death.

The film features the original song &quot;Everyone Matters&quot;, sung by Kermit and Gonzo within the alternate world where Kermit had never been born. The song is reprised at the conclusion of the film. Additionally, the movie pays homage to the iconic Muppet song &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; with a statue of Kermit in a park, dedicated &quot;to the lovers, the dreamers, and you.&quot;

===9/11 connection===
The movie was filmed after the September 11 attacks; one scene, set in a version of 2003 where Kermit was never born, shows the Twin Towers visible in the background. This was due to the photo background mural being created prior to the attacks. Years after the film&#x27;s release, this detail gained viral attention, inspiring jokes and tongue-in-cheek fan theories that Kermit the Frog somehow indirectly led to 9/11.

<text>The estimated symbol,  (also referred to as the ℮-mark, the final EC verification mark (in EU law), or the estimated sign) can be found on most prepackaged products in the European Union (EU). Its use indicates that the prepackage fulfils EU Directive 76/211/EEC, which specifies the maximum permitted tolerances in package content.

The shape and dimensions of the e-mark are defined in EU Directive 2009/34/EC.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009/34/EC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mark is also used on prepackages in the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa.

== Functions ==
The estimated sign indicates that:
* the average quantity of product in a batch of prepackages shall not be less than the nominal quantity stated on the label;
* the proportion of individual prepackages having a negative error greater than the tolerable negative error shall be sufficiently small for batches of prepackages to satisfy the requirements of the official reference test as specified in legislation;
* none of the prepackages marked have a negative error greater than twice the tolerable negative error (since no such prepackage may bear the sign).

The scope of the directive is limited to prepackages that have a predetermined nominal weight of between 5 g and 10 kg or volume of 5 ml and 10 L, are filled without the purchaser present, and in which the quantity cannot be altered without opening or destroying the packing material.

The sign looks like a stylised lowercase &quot;e&quot; and its shape, , is precisely defined by the European Union Directive 2009/34/EC. It must be placed in the same field of vision as the nominal quantity. The sign has been added to the Unicode list of characters as .

== Tolerable negative error ==
Error tolerance decreases as nominal quantity increases, by alternating intervals of a given &quot;percentage&quot; error with intervals of a given &quot;amount&quot; error: these interpolate between the stepwise decreases in percentage error. The estimated sign indicates that the average quantity of product in a batch of prepackages is not less than the nominal quantity stated on the label.

The tolerable negative error is related to the nominal quantity and varies between 9 per cent on prepackages nominally 50g or 50ml or less, to 1.5 per cent on prepackages nominally 1 kilogram or 1 litre or more. The tolerable error decreases as nominal quantity increases, and is done by alternating intervals where there is a percentage error and intervals where there is a fixed error (and thus over those intervals the &quot;percentage&quot; error decreases).

<text>This is a list of significant [[Japanese poetry]] [[Anthology|anthologies]].

== Waka ==

Starting with the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, there were 21 official anthologies, known collectively as the .

===Nara period (710 to 794)===
*&quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;: the oldest anthology in Japanese, c.785, 20 manuscript scrolls, 4,516 poems (when the tanka envoys to the various chōka are numbered as separate poems), Ōtomo no Yakamochi was probably the last to edit the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. It is not organized in any particular way (most metadata is supplied by headnotes), and the poems are written in a Japanese version of the Chinese monosyllabic pronunciation for the Chinese characters.

===Heian period (794 to 1185)===
*Imperial waka anthologies: anthologies as a national project. Each anthology reflected the taste of time and with loyal dignity became canons for contemporaries and those who followed. The earliest three anthologies are often called &quot;Sandaishū&quot;, Three Major Anthologies, and earliest eight &quot;Hachidaishū&quot;, Eight Major Anthologies. Twenty one Imperial anthologies were created: they are collectively known as the &quot;Nijūichidaishū&quot;.
*#&quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;: the first imperial waka anthology, 20 scrolls, 1,111 poems, ordered by Emperor Daigo and completed c. 905, compiled by Ki no Tsurayuki, Ki no Tomonori, Ōshikōchi no Mitsune and Mibu no Tadamine.
*#&quot;Gosen Wakashū&quot;: 20 scrolls, 1,426 poems, ordered in 951 by Emperor Murakami
*#&quot;Shūi Wakashū&quot;: 20 scrolls, 1,351 poems, ordered by ex-Emperor Kazan
*#&quot;Goshūi Wakashū&quot;: 20 scrolls, 1,220 poems, Ordered in 1075 by Emperor Shirakawa, completed in 1086.
*#&quot;Kin&#x27;yō Wakashū&quot;: 10 scrolls, 716 poems, ordered by former Emperor Shirakawa, drafts completed 1124–1127, compiled by Minamoto no Shunrai (Toshiyori)
*#: 10 scrolls, 411 poems, ordered in 1144 by former Emperor Sutoku, completed –1154, compiled by Fujiwara Akisuke (:ja:藤原顕輔)
*#&quot;Senzai Wakashū&quot;: 20 scrolls, 1,285 poems, ordered by former Emperor Go-Shirakawa, probably completed in 1188, compiled by Fujiwara no Shunzei (also known as &quot;Toshinari&quot;)
*#&quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot;: 20 scrolls, 1,978 poems, its name apparently aimed to show the relation and counterpart to Kokin Wakashū, ordered in 1201 by former Emperor Go-Toba, compiled by Fujiwara no Teika (whose first name is sometimes romanized as &quot;Sadaie&quot;), Fujiwara Ariie (:ja:藤原有家), Fujiwara no Ietaka (Karyū), the priest Jakuren, Minamoto Michitomo (:ja:堀川通具), and Asukai Masatsune

====Private editions====
Most waka poets had their own anthologies edited by themselves or by others. Some of these are sources of the imperial anthologies.
*&quot;Hitomarokashū&quot;: an anthology of Kakinomoto no Hitomaro works. The editor is unknown. Perhaps edited in the early Heian period. Many misattributed waka are included.
*&quot;Tsurayukishū&quot;: an anthology of Ki no Tsurayuki works, one of editors of &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;.
*&quot;Kintōshū&quot;: an anthology of Fujiwara no Kintō, the editor of &quot;Wakan Rōeishū&quot;. It gave influence to the waka poetry in the middle Heian period.
*&quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;, or more precisely &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;: edited by Fujiwara no Teika. Till Meiji it had been read as elementary book for waka poets.
*&quot;Fujiwara no Teika Kashū&quot;: an anthology of Fujiwara no Teika works.
*&quot;Izumi Shikibu Shū&quot;: an anthology of Izumi Shikibu works.
