<text>Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham (20 February 1923 – 6 August 1985) was a Guyanese politician and the leader of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana from 1964 until his death in 1985. He served as Premier of British Guiana from 1964 to 1966, Prime Minister of Guyana from 1964 to 1980 and then as the first executive president of Guyana (2nd president overall) from 1980 to 1985. He is often regarded as a strongman who embraced his own version of socialism.

Educated as a lawyer, Burnham was instrumental in the foundation of two political parties (the People&#x27;s National Congress and the People&#x27;s Progressive Party) that would come to dominate the politics of Guyana. During his time as head of government, Guyana moved from being a British colony to being a republic with no constitutional ties to the United Kingdom. His premiership was characterized by the nationalisation of foreign-owned private industries, membership of the Non-Aligned Movement and authoritarian domestic policy. Despite being widely regarded as having a significant role in the political, social, and economic development of Guyana, his presidency was marred by accusations of Afrocentrism, state-sanctioned violence, corruption, and electoral fraud.

==Early life and education==

Burnham was born in Kitty, a suburb of Georgetown, Demerara County, British Guiana, as one of three or four (Olga, Freddie, Jessica, and Flora) children. His parents were James Ethelbert Burnham, a schoolmaster, and Rachel Abigail Sampson, and he grew up in an Afro-Guyanese, Methodist household. Burnham&#x27;s father had his roots in a slave family from Barbados, and his family name came from the surname of the plantation owner. On the abolition of slavery, Burnham&#x27;s ancestor migrated to British Guiana.

According to Burnham&#x27;s sister Jessie, the family grew up on 4 Pike Street, Kitty. Jessie also attests that their father was the headteacher at Kitty Methodist School for 37 years, and sat on the Village Council. Forbes Burnham attended Kitty Methodist School and Central High School before attending the prestigious secondary school, Queen&#x27;s College, where he met future political rival Cheddi Jagan. His sister said that Burnham was ambitious from a young age, and that he was bullied at Central High School for his small stature and academic prowess. At Queen&#x27;s College, Burnham excelled academically, receiving the Centenary Exhibition (1936), the Government Junior (1937), and the Percival Exhibition (1938).

In 1942, he won the British Guiana Scholarship to study at the University of London, as the top student in British Guiana. Burnham was unable to travel to the United Kingdom due to World War II, instead working as an assistant master at Queen&#x27;s college and completing a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London through external examinations. After he was allowed to travel to London, Burnham received a law degree from the London School of Economics, at the time a constituent college of the University of London, in 1947 or 1948 and was the president of the West Indian Student Union at the university for the year 1947–1948 He went on to pass the bar in 1948, and became a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn. Burnham met many African and Caribbean students – including Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria, Seretse Khama of Botswana and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana as well as Michael Manley of Jamaica and Errol Barrow of Barbados – during his studies in London.

In London, Burnham won the Best Speaker&#x27;s Cup, awarded by the Faculty of Law. He also attended the Student&#x27;s Congresses in Prague and Paris, and was a member of the League of Coloured Peoples.

He left the United Kingdom to return to British Guiana on 20 December 1948, departing Liverpool on the Empress of France bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia, and arrived in Georgetown in 1949.

== 1949–1955: The People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) ==

===Founding the People&#x27;s Progressive Party===
In 1949, after returning from his studies in the United Kingdom, Burnham entered the private law chambers of Cameron and Shepherd before setting up his own private law practice, Clarke and Martin. Also in 1949, Burnham became the leader of the British Guiana Labour Party (BGLP), which had been formed in 1946. In the 1947 elections the Labour Party had won 5 of 14 seats in the Legislative Council, making them the largest party.

Less than a year after his return from the United Kingdom, Burnham was one of the founders of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP), which was launched on 1 January 1950. The Indo-Guyanese labour leader Cheddi Jagan became Leader of the PPP, Jagan&#x27;s wife Janet Jagan became the secretary and Burnham became the first party chairman. Jagan had been the leader of the Political Affairs Committee, which merged with the BGLP to form the PPP. Burnham chose the name of the new party.

===Minister of Education===
In 1952, Burnham became the president of the party&#x27;s affiliated trade union, the British Guiana Labour Union, and was elected to Georgetown City Council in 1953. In the 1953 British Guiana general election on 27 April 1953, the PPP won 18 of 24 seats in the first election with universal suffrage in Guyana, with both Burnham and his sister Jessie elected to the House of Assembly. In the short-lived PPP government that followed, Burnham served as Minister of Education. Burnham initially threatened to split the party if he were not made sole leader of the PPP, but a compromise was reached by which Burnham and his allies in the party received ministerial appointments. The newly formed government began to dissent against colonial rule, refusing to send a delegation to the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, urging strike action and repealing several laws which the Colonial Office wanted in place. This dissent took place during the Red Scare, and British statesmen were worried about a possible communist revolution in Guyana; Winston Churchill remarked that &quot;(W)e ought surely to get American support in doing all we can to break the Communist teeth in British Guiana … (P)erhaps they would even send Senator McCarthy down there.&quot;

On 9 October 1953, the British administration suspended the Constitution of British Guiana and sent in armed troops after the PPP government passed the Labour Relations Act (modelled on the Wagner Act) the day before, marking the end of the PPP government. Burnham and Jagan would travel to London to unsuccessfully protest the decision, where they were subject to secret surveillance by British intelligence services. Following this, Burnham and Jagan travelled to India in an unsuccessful attempt to find support for their cause against the British. The interim government appointed by the British would last until 1957.

During the suspension of the constitution, the interim government gave Burnham fewer restrictions than other senior members of the party, he was not imprisoned while the other senior members were, and he was given tacit encouragement to begin a breakaway faction within the party, which he would do two years later.

== 1955–1964: Leader of the People&#x27;s National Congress (PNC) ==

===Origins of the People&#x27;s National Congress===
At a conference at the Metropole Cinema in Georgetown on 12–13 February 1955, the PPP split into two factions, one led by Burnham (&quot;Burnhamite&quot;) and the other by Jagan (&quot;Jaganite&quot;). Jagan supported a socialist domestic policy, but Burnham&#x27;s faction was more moderate. The two also had personality differences. After the 1957 election, where Jagan&#x27;s faction won 9 seats and Burnham&#x27;s won only 3, Burnham went on to form the People&#x27;s National Congress (PNC) in 1957, becoming leader of the opposition. The PNC entered its first election under that name in 1961. Also in 1957, Burnham became President of the Guyana Bar Association, a position he would hold until 1964. In 1959, Burnham was elected Mayor of Georgetown, a position he would hold until 1964 when he was re-elected until 1966. The United Democratic Party merged with the PNC in 1959.

The political split deepened the racial division between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. Guyanese politics continues to largely follow racial lines, with PPP support mainly of a South Asian background and PNC support mostly of African descent. This would follow the rural-urban divide as well, Afro-Guyanese tending to live in urban-coastal areas and Indo-Guyanese tending to live in rural-interior areas. After the split, Jagan&#x27;s PPP and Burnham&#x27;s PNC largely became the political expressions of the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese aspirations respectively, and advocated for their supporter&#x27;s interests.

===1961 general election===

In the 1961 election, Burnham&#x27;s PNC party won 11 seats in the Legislative Assembly with 41% of the vote. Despite only winning 1.64% more of the vote than the PNC, the PPP won 20 seats, nearly double the number of seats won by the PNC. This led to mass demonstrations, racial tensions and a general strike. The Governor declared a state of emergency and British troops were deployed.

===The Kaldor Budget and Black Friday===
On 31 January 1962 the PPP government announced what would later be known as the &quot;Kaldor Budget&quot;, advised by economist Nicholas Kaldor, including an increase in tax and import duty, which was opposed by opposition parties, who started taking action against the government, including mass demonstrations led by the PNC. According to the Wynn Parry Commission, on 12 February, Burnham gave the following speech: &quot;Comrades, the fight starts now. Tomorrow at 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon there is a demonstration organized by the Trade Union Congress, a demonstration against the harsh proposals of the budget, which make life unbearable. No doubt the Riot Squad will be there. Do you still want to go? Comrades, remember that tomorrow Jagan&#x27;s army is coming down from Cane Grove and Windsor Forest. Do you still want to go?&quot; the mass action would culminate 16 February 1962, later called &quot;Black Friday&quot;. 56 businesses were destroyed, 87 damaged by fire and 66 were looted. One Police Superintendent was killed and 39 injured, while four looters were fatally shot and 41 injured. The rioters also attacked the Electricity Plant, the Water Works, Parliament, and Jagan&#x27;s residence. The riots were responded to by HMS Troubridge (R00) and HMS Wizard (R72). Black smoke covered Georgetown and a large fire was evident.

===International intervention in British Guiana===
According to declassified documents, in the early 1960s The United States Government led by John F. Kennedy became increasingly convinced that Jagan&#x27;s PPP government had communist ideals. Due to the radical views of Cheddi Jagan (who leaned towards communism) and Jagan&#x27;s alliances with the Soviet Union and Cuba, Burnham was supported by Western nations. In May 1962 Kennedy held direct talks with British prime minister Harold Macmillan, and Burnham visited Washington. Senior officials in the United States decided that Burnham&#x27;s proposed socialism was preferable to Jagan&#x27;s ideology, but also concluded that Jagan would become Head of Government of an independent Guyana without US intervention. Burnham readily agreed to US action against Jagan. In 1962, Kennedy approved intervention against Jagan&#x27;s government. Independence was delayed by British officials, allowing time for a covert operation by the Central Intelligence Agency. Both Peter D&#x27;Aguiar (leader of the third largest party, The United Force) and Burnham pledged to support the notion of proportional representation (opposed by Jagan), and Burnham began to receive financial aid from the CIA.

Burnham was appointed President of the Guyana Labour Union in 1963.

The CIA has been accused of assisting strike action against the PPP government beginning in 1963. This action would eventually turn to violence, with arson and bombing at government buildings. Burnham was mentioned in police reports.

===Lead up to the 1964 election===
In 1963, further talks between President Kennedy and British prime minister Macmillan led to the British decision to impose a December 1964 election using proportional representation, after which British Guiana would be granted independence.The Americans received assurances from Burnham and D&#x27;Aguiar that they would mutually support each other in the election, and US money would be used for political campaigning. The lead-up to the election was marked by widespread violence, with nearly 200 murders and 2,600 families displaced. A series of racially-motivated incidents took place in and around Linden, including the Wismar Massacre on 26 May, the sinking of the Sun Chapman on 6 July and the following murders of 5 Indo-Guyanese individuals at Mackenzie. In one incident in August 1964, Jagan, Burnham, and d&#x27;Aguiar were conferring about reducing the spate of violence when the headquarters of the PPP were bombed just down the street.

Just before the election, the CIA estimated that the PPP and PNC would take about 40 percent of the vote, United Force would take 15 percent, and the false-flag Justice Party (aimed at Indo-Guyanese voters and backed by the CIA), would take 5 percent.

== 1964–1966: Premier of British Guiana ==

In the 1964 election on 7 December 1964, Jagan&#x27;s PPP won the highest percentage of the vote (46% to the PNC&#x27;s 41%), but it did not win a majority. Burnham succeeded in forming a coalition with the United Force (TUF) (which had won the remaining 12% of the votes) and became premier of British Guiana on 14 December. Jagan refused to resign, and had to be removed by Governor Richard Luyt. Burnham would remain as Head of Government of Guyana for the next 21 years.

In 1965, Burnham along with Errol Barrow of Barbados were the founders of the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA), which came into operation on 1 May 1968. CARIFTA was in 1973 superseded by CARICOM.

On 26 May 1966, British Guiana became an independent country and was renamed &quot;Guyana&quot;. Under the country&#x27;s constitution, the head of state would be the British monarch, represented in Guyana by the governor general, who served in a largely ceremonial capacity, and the Head of Government would be the Prime Minister (Forbes) appointed by a majority in the National Assembly.

== 1966–1980: Prime Minister of Guyana ==
In one of Burnham&#x27;s first acts upon independence, he passed a sweeping &quot;National Security Act&quot;, permitting unrestricted search-and-seizure powers and the ability to detain individuals for up to 90 days without trial.

Burnham still had a significant electoral disadvantage, as voting support mostly followed racial lines, and about 50% of the Guyanese population on independence was Indo-Guyanese and would likely support Jagan&#x27;s PPP, making a fair election nearly impossible to win for Burnham. A telegram from the US Ambassador stated that &quot;he intends to remain in power indefinitely&quot; and &quot;if necessary, he is prepared to employ unorthodox methods to achieve his aims&quot;. In a meeting with US president Lyndon B. Johnson in July 1966, Burnham discussed a scheme to promote immigration of Afro-Caribbean people in an effort to improve his electoral chances in the 1968 election. This scheme was unsuccessful. In 1967, Burnham stated that &quot;overseas vote figures could be manipulated pretty much as he wished&quot;. Burnham later stated that he would &quot;identify and register all Guyanese of African ancestry in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States in order to get their absentee votes in the next election&quot;, and suggested that Indo-Guyanese living abroad may have trouble getting registered or receiving ballots.

In October 1966, Venezuelan soldiers occupied Ankoko Island in the disputed Essequibo territory. Burnham demanded the withdrawal of Venezuelan armed forces, but his request was denied.

===1968 general election===

The PNC attained a majority government in the general elections of 1968 through electoral fraud, using an inflated &quot;overseas vote&quot; to skew the results in their favour. The PNC won 93.7% of the 36,745 overseas ballots, allowing Burnham to claim an absolute majority. An independent review by the Opinion Research Centre of London was only able to verify 15% of the entries on the overseas list. An investigation looking into the identity of some of the voters found that two horses near Manchester, a closed butcher&#x27;s shop in Brooklyn and a railway in London had been counted as registered voters, and there were many addresses where the reported voters had never been resident. Only just over 100 voters of 900 checked in the United Kingdom were genuine, and in New York only 40% were genuine. Peter D&#x27;Aguiar called it &quot;a seizure of power by fraud, not an election.&quot;

===Rupununi Uprising and Tigri Area dispute===
In 1968, a conference of 40,000 Amerindian people presented demands to Burnham, being dissatisfied with his afrocentrist policies. The Agriculture Minister declared that the inhabitants&#x27; land ownership certifications would no longer be recognized and the zone would be occupied by the Afro-Guyanese population. A provisional secessionist government was declared and attacks on Lethem began. The uprising was ultimately quelled by the Guyana Defence Force (GDF).

In 1969, following the establishment of Camp Tigri by Surinamese authorities, the Guyana Defence Force would take Camp Tigri and assert authority over the Tigri Area. Guyana continues to hold the camp despite a 1970 agreement to withdraw military forces.

===Establishment of the Co-Operative Republic of Guyana===
Before 1970, Burnham mostly pursued moderate political policies. In 1970, he veered sharply to the left and established relations with Cuba (8 December 1972) and the Soviet Union (17 December 1970) and a strong relationship with North Korea. On 23 February of that year, he declared Guyana a &quot;co-operative republic&quot;. Adopting a policy of autarky, he banned all forms of imports into the country, including flour and varieties of rice that had been integral to the diet of Indo-Guyanese. Burnham also nationalised the major industries that were foreign-owned and -controlled. By 1979 his policies had reduced the private sector&#x27;s share in the economy to only 10%. In declaring the Co-Operative republic, Burnham replaced the Head of State, removing the British monarch and installing Arthur Chung as the first president (in a mostly ceremonial role), though Guyana remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations (Sonny Ramphal, Burnham&#x27;s foreign minister from 1972-1975, became the second Commonwealth Secretary-General in 1975, and served in that post until 1990).

===Port of Spain Protocol===
On 18 June 1970 Burnham signed the Port of Spain Protocol with Venezuela. The protocol, in place for 12 years, promoted co-operation between the two countries on the Border Dispute in Guayana Esequiba. The protocol was not renewed after 12 years.

===Membership of the Non-Aligned movement===
Burnham, after attending the 1970 summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Lusaka, Zambia, paid official visits to several African countries—Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia—over the period 12–30 September 1970. The Guyanese government remained fully involved in the African liberation movement throughout the 1970s.

Burnham sent more than a hundred Guyanese public servants to various departments of the Zambian Government. Many Guyanese doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries worked in Southern African states throughout the 1970s.

===House of Israel===

In 1972, Rabbi David Hill arrived in Guyana and established the House of Israel, a religious sect that the opposition accused of operating as a private army for Burnham&#x27;s PNC. In 2014 Joseph Hamilton, a former House of Israel priest, testified that the House of Israel committed &quot;oppressive and terrorizing acts on behalf of the PNC.&quot;

===1973 general election===

In the 1973 general election, Burnham received 70% of the vote and 37 of the 53 seats in the National Assembly. It is generally accepted that Burnham had significant untoward influence on the results of the elections, making them fraudulent. During the transportation of ballot boxes by the military, the army shot dead two Indo-Guyanese poll workers, who became known as the &quot;Ballot Box Martyrs&quot;. Shortly after the election, Burnham expanded powers of preventive detention, allowing restrictions on movement and possession of firearms, and search without warrant.

===Declaration of Sophia===

On 14 December 1974, Burnham issued the Declaration of Sophia, stating that &quot;the Party should assume unapologetically its paramountcy over the Government which is merely one of its executive arms.&quot; The Declaration also called for a transition to a socialist state, and a nationalisation of its economy. The declaration also led to the founding of the Guyana National Service, a paramilitary organisation under the control of the party.

===1978 referendum===

The PNC government&#x27;s five-year term was due to end in 1978, forcing a new election. On 1 April 1978, Burnham announced a referendum to allow the constitution to be changed by a 2/3 majority in parliament (which the PNC had) rather than a referendum. The opposition presented a united front against the referendum. During the campaign, the PNC terminated the contract of critical newspaper &quot;the Catholic Standard&quot; with a state-owned printing company, hampering their ability to distribute critical material. Advertisements for opposition parties were banned in state media, and violence was used to break up opposition meetings and gatherings. Public employees were forced to sign blank proxy forms allowing others to vote on their behalf. It was also noted that there were over 10% (65,000) more people on the electoral role than the United Nations estimate of the number of eligible voters. The opposition groups eventually urged the Guyanese population to boycott the referendum. During this time, prominent Guyanese poet Martin Carter was beaten by individuals affiliated with the PNC while protesting the government&#x27;s refusal to hold elections.

Burnham won the 1978 referendum. There are anecdotal claims from hundreds of Indo-Guyanese (and Afro-Guyanese who were PPP supporters) that PNC enforcers aggressively, often violently, denied PPP supporters the opportunity to vote. Official figures showed the referendum passing with an implausible 97.9 percent of the vote. There were accusations that PNC supporters voted multiple times.

A week later, on 17 July 1978, the government used its new powers to change the constitution to postpone the scheduled election. These powers were also used to introduce the new constitution introduced in 1980.

===Involvement in Jonestown===

On 18 November 1978, a total of 909 people of the Peoples Temple died in a mass suicide in Jonestown. Burnham had previously allowed the group, led by Jim Jones, to move to Guyana from San Francisco, US, and had a good relationship with the group. The incident drew international attention to Guyana, and an inquest established by the opposition blamed Burnham, considered to be an ally of Jones, for the deaths.

There are suggestions that Burnham&#x27;s government participated in a cover-up of the affair. Burnham&#x27;s wife Viola and his deputy prime minister Ptolemy Reid were among the first to the scene, and may have returned from the massacre site with nearly US$1 million in cash, gold and jewellery. One of Burnham&#x27;s secretaries may also have visited Jonestown only hours before it occurred, a visit that was never explained.

===1979 Fire, and murder of Bernard Darke===
In 1979, a fire destroyed many of the official government records, including official communications with the Peoples Temple. There is some speculation that the fire was started deliberately by Burnham&#x27;s government, and there are reports that men in Guyana Defence Force uniforms were seen running from the fire. Two different government offices were burned. Walter Rodney was arrested and charged with arson. The trial was deferred three times, and later dropped due to lack of evidence.

During civil unrest after the fire and arrest, Jesuit priest Bernard Darke was stabbed to death by members of the House of Israel, a religious cult closely associated with Burnham and his PNC party. Darke was associated with the &quot;Catholic Standard&quot;, a newspaper described as being &quot;extremely critical&quot; of the PNC. According to a 2013 article by Kaieteur News, the editor of Catholic News, Andrew Morrison, may have been the actual target of this attack, making it a failed assassination attempt.

== 1980–1985: President of the Co-Operative Republic of Guyana ==

In 1980 the constitution was changed to make the presidency an executive post; until this time the post had been held by Arthur Chung in a ceremonial head-of-state role. Burnham won election as president that year, winning 76% of the vote to 20% for Jagan in the official results. International Observers protested that Indo-Guyanese voters were prevented from voting in several polling locations, and there were widespread accusations of electoral fraud. The executive president was granted the powers to dissolve Parliament at will, veto legislation, and to appoint or dismiss almost all senior members of government.

Burnham introduced mass games to Guyana. They were first held in February 1980 to commemorate the founding of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.

===Assassination of Walter Rodney===

Walter Rodney died on 13 June 1980 in Georgetown at the age of 38 in a car bomb explosion. His brother Donald, who was injured in the explosion, said that a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force and a member of the House of Israel, named Gregory Smith, had given Rodney the bomb that killed him.

In 2014, Donald Ramotar launched an inquiry into the murder of Rodney despite resistance from the PNC. In 2016, the Commission of Inquiry released findings that state that President Forbes Burnham, aided by the Guyana Defence Force and Guyana Police Force, was part of the conspiracy to assassinate Rodney, the leader of the Working People&#x27;s Alliance (WPA), a group which posed a threat to Burnham. Rodney&#x27;s WPA believed that different ethnic groups (including Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese) historically disenfranchised by colonialism should all have a part in the governance of Guyana, a position that challenged Burnham&#x27;s hold on power.

===Last years of presidency===
In the last years of Burnham&#x27;s presidency, his quasi-socialist policies led to economic stagnation. Guyana was not able to export sufficient goods, especially Guyana&#x27;s main exports, bauxite, rice and sugar, to earn the foreign exchange for vital imports, leading to a trade deficit and massive foreign debt. Commodity shortages and a near-breakdown in public services occurred, and Burnham enforced austerity measures and looked for economic support from Soviet-leaning countries. Burnham&#x27;s authoritarian policies continued to lead to mass emigration, contributing to a net decrease in the population of Guyana that continued throughout the 1980s.

In Burnham&#x27;s state-controlled economy, Afro-Guyanese held most jobs and the news media were controlled by the government. Jagan claimed that there was also economic suppression, as people remained politically inactive due to fear of losing their jobs. Burnham continued as president until his death in 1985.

==Political philosophy==
Burnham&#x27;s leadership was characterized by authoritarian rule. According to Walter Rodney, &quot;Burnham&#x27;s style of rule has many similarities with that of the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. Somoza oppressed not only the exploited classes of his country but also sectors of his own class (the bourgeoisie) who refused to go along with his personal style of political domination.&quot;

Rodney referred to Burnham&#x27;s political philosophy as &quot;pseudo-socialism&quot;. Rival Cheddi Jagan said that &quot;Burnham is like a cork in the ocean and moves with the tides.&quot; According to Manning Marable, &quot;The Carter administration viewed Guyana in the same political league as Somalia and Communist China, a nominal socialist regime which outlawed democratic rights at home and was willing to become a junior partner with US imperialism.&quot;

Burnham was a supporter of the Non-Aligned Movement, which Guyana had joined in 1970. Membership of the Non-Aligned movement was seen as a cornerstone of Guyana&#x27;s foreign policy. Burnham&#x27;s other foreign policies included establishing maintaining membership and good relations within CARICOM (including being a founding member of CARIFTA and being the man behind the first 1972 Caribbean Festival of Arts) and in the Commonwealth of Nations. Burnham also advocated regionalism.

Burnham was staunchly opposed to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies. On one occasion, English Cricketer Robin Jackman&#x27;s visa was rescinded after his arrival in Georgetown due to his connections with apartheid in South Africa, and a boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics was also put in place by Burnham in protest after the New Zealand national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 and were not banned by the International Olympic Committee. After Burnham&#x27;s death, in 2013 the post-apartheid government in South Africa awarded Burnham the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo for his support of South African interests.

Burnham made all education, including tertiary education, free during his time in office.

Burnham was accused of corruption during his premiership by opposition parties. Walter Rodney said that &quot;Burnham encourages around himself individuals who are weak or corrupt because he then exercises vicious control over them,&quot; and called his administration a &quot;corrupt dictatorship&quot;.

===Afrocentrist policies and accusations of racism===
Burnham&#x27;s administration has been accused of afrocentrist policies and discrimination against the Indian population. Burnham&#x27;s administration was mostly Afro-Guyanese. The Guyanese armed forces under the Burnham administration were majority Afro-Guyanese after Burnham purged the armed forces of Indo-Guyanese from 1968, and under the state-controlled economy Afro-Guyanese took up the majority of jobs despite being a minority of the population. The resettlement of Afro-Guyanese in Amerindian lands was a major contributing factor in the Rupununi Uprising.

Guyanese journalist Freddie Kissoon expressed the opinion that Burnham was not racist, but was aware that his support was predominantly Afro-Guyanese, the Indo-Guyanese mostly supported Jagan, so that Burnham had to deliver policies to please the Afro-Guyanese racial group and maintain his popular support. Kissoon went on to criticise Burnham for his authoritarian policies regardless of intention, stating that &quot;The reign of Forbes Burnham was frightening and demoralizing&quot; and also stating that during Burnham&#x27;s tenure &quot;almost 99 percent of Indian Guyanese felt that Guyana had no place for them, and that its president and his party were treating them as second-class citizens,&quot; and that Indo-Guyanese &quot;lived in fear of Burnham&quot;.

Walter Rodney wrote in an essay that a pamphlet by Jessie Burnham described Forbes&#x27; &quot;racist attitude towards Indians&quot;. In the pamphlet, a letter is shown in which Burnham writes &quot;I feel strongly about the Indian attitude but the time has not come yet for me to broadcast those feelings&quot;. In 1962, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. stated that Burnham was regarded as racist by the US state department and British colonial office.

===Authoritarian policies===
Burnham passed many authoritarian policies during his tenure, starting with the &quot;National Security Act&quot; after independence. Burnham would pass laws to restrict movement, increase police powers to search and detain, and restrict firearms. He would come to tightly control media coverage. He would also make constitutional changes that would provide him with the power to veto legislation, make further constitutional changes without a referendum, control governmental appointments and dissolve parliament.

===Role in state-sanctioned violence===
In 2016, Burnham&#x27;s government was found to be complicit in the assassination of Walter Rodney and has been accused of using violence to break up opposition meetings and gatherings, being complicit in the deliberate arson of government buildings, and having a role in the Murder of Bernard Darke. Burnham was Head of Government when the army killed two Indo-Guyanese poll workers in 1973 (the &quot;Ballot Box Martyrs&quot;).

Prior to taking control of the Guyanese government, Burnham was mentioned in police reports in the violent demonstrations of 1963, and his PNC party was accused of leading the mobs that caused extensive property damage in the Black Friday riots of 1962.

===Covert involvement with the CIA===
According to declassified documents from the National Security Archive, From 1962 to 1968 Burnham was provided with support from the US Central Intelligence Agency. During this time, Burnham agreed to CIA intervention in Guyana, and received financial assistance in the lead-up to both the 1964 and 1968 elections.

==Personal life==
Burnham&#x27;s sister Jessie Burnham was also active in politics, and was one of the first female members of the House of Assembly.

Burnham&#x27;s first marriage was to Trinidadian Sheila Bernice Lataste-Burnham, having met her in London when they were both students. Lataste was born in Woodbrook. They married in Tranquility Methodist Church, Port of Spain in May 1951. With Lataste, Burnham had three children: Roxanne Van West Charles, Anabelle Pollard and Francesca Onu. The couple later divorced. Lataste-Burnham died in 2011 at the age of 91.

In February 1967 Burnham married high school Latin teacher Viola Victorine Harper (Viola Burnham), who also became involved in politics, serving as Vice President of Guyana under Desmond Hoyte. Viola died in 2003 at the age of 72. Burnham had two daughters with Viola, Melanie and Ulele, and adopted a son, Kamana.

Burnham was a Methodist by religion. His hobbies included swimming and horse-riding, and he also played chess, billiards, patience, cricket, tennis and fishing.

Burnham lived in Castellani House from 1965 to 1985, during which time it was referred to as &quot;The Residence&quot;.

===Personality===
After a meeting in 1962, Thomas J. Dodd described Burnham as &quot;an intelligent, well-educated gentleman&quot;. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., also in 1962, said that Burnham was regarded as &quot;an unprincipled opportunist, racist and demagogue, only interested in personal power.&quot; Jessie Burnham described her brother as ambitious and manipulative. Neil L. Whitehead claimed in a book that Burnham was superstitious and engaged with obeah, employing an obeah advisor known as Mother Monica and devouring raw duck eggs and 100-year-old Chinese eggs to increase his potency or power.

==Death and burial==

Burnham died of heart failure during throat surgery in Georgetown on 6 August 1985 at the age of 62. Several sources suggest that Forbes had had heart problems in the years leading up to his death, and may have had diabetes. A man who worked for Burnham said he had heard that the president had had a &quot;heart scare&quot; about three and a half years before his death. The throat surgery was conducted with the assistance of two specialists from Cuba. He was buried in the Botanical Gardens a few days later. His body was later exhumed and taken to the Soviet Union to be preserved for permanent display. It was returned to Guyana for his final burial a year later. It was not explained why Burnham was having throat surgery&#x27; it was suggested he may have had a polyp, or throat cancer. There are also theories as to why Burnham&#x27;s body was buried after being prepared for permanent open display.

His body is in Burnham&#x27;s Mausoleum (built in 1986) in the Guyana Botanical Gardens in Georgetown. The Mausoleum is built mostly from reinforced concrete, with a floor of granite sourced from the Mazaruni and Upper Essequibo regions. It was designed by Guyanese architect George Henry in a crucifix shape. It is maintained by the National Trust of Guyana.

==Legacy==

Burnham is considered a controversial figure. Burnham&#x27;s successor, Desmond Hoyte, called Burnham a &quot;great leader&quot;. President of Guyana David A. Granger said &quot;He was a brilliant man, a futuristic thinker, a man of honour, having integrity and a high degree of discipline,&quot; and Granger would call Burnham the &quot;author of social cohesion and architect of national unity&quot;. Indira Gandhi named Burnham as one of the twentieth century&#x27;s outstanding figures. Moe Taylor, a historian at the University of British Columbia, called Burnham&#x27;s premiership a &quot;deeply divisive chapter in Guyana&#x27;s recent history.&quot; In a review of Burnham&#x27;s rise to power published in 2020, John Prados characterised Burnham as &quot;corrupt, arbitrary, and self-dealing&quot;, and referred to him as &quot;a dictatorial figure&quot;.

As of 2022, the two political parties that Burnham founded remain the two most popular and influential parties in Guyanese politics, with Burnham&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Congress Reform party being the most important member in A Partnership for National Unity, and these two parties closely contesting the 2020 Guyanese general election. Support for the two parties continues to follow the racial divide between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese.

Burnham&#x27;s administration put in place many of the national symbols of Guyana during his premiership, including the Flag, the Coat of arms, the National Anthem, the national flower, national bird and the national motto. The 1763 monument to commemorate the Berbice slave uprising and the Non-aligned monument with busts of Nasser, Nkrumah, Nehru, and Tito were both erected during Burnham&#x27;s premiership. Burnham instituted national holidays including Pagwah, Diwali and Mashramani. National projects completed during his premiership include the Soesdyke-Linden Highway, Demerara Harbour Bridge and Cheddi Jagan International Airport.

Burnham improved women&#x27;s legal rights in Guyana with the release of the State Paper on Equality for Women in 1976, which was aimed at &quot;securing equality of treatment by employers of men and women workers&quot; and &quot;making sex discrimination unlawful in employment, recruitment, training, education and the provision of housing, goods, services and facilities to the public.&quot; Burnham also opened the door to women serving in the Guyana Defence Force.

Guyana obtained massive debts during Burnham&#x27;s tenure, experienced no GDP growth between 1973 and 1993, and experienced relatively high inflation of around 10% per year in the same period.

Following Burnham&#x27;s death, Desmond Hoyte became president. The 1985 Guyanese general election was also considered to be fraudulent; the next &quot;free and fair&quot; election would come in 1992, the first fair election since 1964, where Cheddi Jagan was elected president. The Guyanese electoral process remains subject to voter fraud; the 2020 Guyanese general election was marred by an attempt by PNC leader David A. Granger to alter the results, with Bruce Golding stated he had &quot;never seen a more transparent attempt to alter the result of an election.&quot;

<doc id="1120114" wikidata="Q236613" url="?curid=1120114" title="Martha Wainwright">
<text>Martha Wainwright (born May 8, 1976) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. She has released seven critically-acclaimed studio albums.

Wainwright is the daughter of musicians Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III and the younger sister of singer–composer Rufus Wainwright.

Martha Wainwright&#x27;s live performances have received critical praise, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; writing that her concerts &quot;leave in no doubt that she is a singular star.&quot; Apart from music, she has appeared in several film projects, including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot; and the HBO miniseries &quot;Olive Kitteridge&quot; alongside Frances McDormand. Wainwright owns and operates Ursa, a café, concert-hall, bar, and recording space in Montreal.

==Early life==
Martha was born in New York City on May 8, 1976, to folk musicians Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. She moved to Montreal with her mother and brother when she was one year old, and was raised in Montreal in a musical family. She is Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s sister and they frequently perform together and collaborate on each other&#x27;s albums. Martha is also half-sister to Lucy Wainwright Roche, with whom she collaborated on the album &quot;Songs In The Dark&quot;, which was nominated for a Juno Award.

==Career==
===Debut EPs and &quot;Martha Wainwright&quot;===
Martha Wainwright&#x27;s first release was an album-length independent cassette of ten tracks, &quot;Ground Floor,&quot; released in 1997. Wainwright released two EPs in 2005—&quot;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&quot; and &quot;I Will Internalize&quot;—both of which contained some tracks that also appeared on her self-titled studio album, &quot;Martha Wainwright&quot;. PopMatters called the &quot;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&quot; EP &quot;a rebellious introductory stance for an artist looking to provoke or silence potential critics.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; included the song &quot;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&quot; in their songs of the year and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a blistering prelude to her debut album.&quot; &quot;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&quot; was inspired by Wainwright&#x27;s father, Loudon Wainwright III. She wrote the track as a response to her father&#x27;s way of writing songs about his family, rather than tending to them. Despite the sentiment, she collaborated a year earlier with Loudon on the song &quot;You Never Phone&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;So Damn Happy&quot;.

&quot;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&quot; was used at the end of the second episode in season three of the Netflix original series &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;, and at the end of the fourth episode in season one of the HBO original series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;.

Wainwright&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released through Zoë Records and Drowned in Sound in April 2005, and earned Wainwright a nomination for New Artist of the Year at the 2006 Juno Awards. The album also reached number 43 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers chart. Her debut album featured contributions from her mother, Kate McGarrigle, her brother, Rufus Wainwright, her cousin, Lily Lanken, as well as organ and saxophone from Garth Hudson of The Band. Pitchfork wrote that the album &quot;proves Martha Wainwright has a strong, distinct, fully formed musical identity, which would be just as impressive by any other name.&quot;

In 2006, Wainwright collaborated with Snow Patrol on their song &quot;Set the Fire to the Third Bar&quot;, off their critically and commercially successful album &quot;Eyes Open&quot;. Frontman Gary Lightbody says that he wrote the song with Wainwright&#x27;s vocals specifically in mind. Alvin Chan from &quot;musicOMH&quot; raved that &quot;Lightbody&#x27;s vocals are perfectly complemented by Canadian songstress Martha Wainwright, whose arrestingly haunting voice is put to good use.&quot;

===&quot;I Know You&#x27;re Married But I&#x27;ve Got Feelings Too&quot;===
Wainwright&#x27;s second album, &quot;I Know You&#x27;re Married But I&#x27;ve Got Feelings Too&quot;, was released through Zoë Records and Drowned in Sound in June 2008, resulting in the No. 10 position on the Top Heatseekers &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canada Music Charts, among other chart positions throughout Europe and Australia. The album was hailed for showcasing Wainwright&#x27;s musical maturity and talent as a songwriter, and was a Long List Nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize. The album features 12 original tracks and cover versions of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and, as a bonus track in some countries, the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot;. The Australian release included a limited edition digipak with additional images and the bonus track. &quot;Comin&#x27; Tonight&quot; was released as an iTunes exclusive download in Australia in April 2008.

In addition to returning collaborators Anna McGarrigle, Kate McGarrigle, Rufus Wainwright, and Garth Hudson, Donald Fagen of Steely Dan contributed synthesizers on &quot;So Many Friends&quot;, and Pete Townshend played electric guitar on &quot;You Cheated Me&quot; and &quot;Comin&#x27; Tonight&quot;.

===&quot;Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright&#x27;s Piaf Record&quot;===
&quot;Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright&#x27;s Piaf Record&quot;, a tribute to legendary French singer Édith Piaf, was released in November 2009. An homage to Piaf, it was received with glowing reviews, leaving audiences &quot;stunned&quot; by Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;incredible range and talent&quot;. The album was recorded during three performances in New York&#x27;s Dixon Place Theatre in June 2009. The accompanying DVD was filmed by Jamie Catto. The name of the album comes from the lyrics to Piaf&#x27;s song &quot;Les Grognards&quot;.

===&quot;Come Home to Mama&quot;===
&quot;Come Home To Mama&quot; was released on October 15, 2012. The album was recorded at Sean Lennon&#x27;s home studio in New York City and produced by Cibo Matto&#x27;s Yuka Honda. Guest musicians on the album included Honda, Lennon, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline, and Dirty Three drummer Jim White. &quot;Proserpina&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was written by Wainwright&#x27;s mother, Kate McGarrigle, who died in 2010. Produced by Cibo Matto&#x27;s Yuka Honda, it was heralded by Mojo Magazine as a &quot;substantial and brilliantly sung career best.&quot; The album peaked at #6 on the Billboard Canada Music Charts and #21 US Top Heatseekers &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The song &quot;Four Black Sheep&quot; was originally recorded in 2009 for CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Great Canadian Song Quest&quot;.

===&quot;Trauma&quot;===
In 2013, she recorded the soundtrack album for the fourth season of the television drama series &quot;Trauma.&quot; For the soundtrack project, Wainwright selected songs drawn mainly from the Quebec musical repertoire. In addition to covers of Offenbach, Claude Dubois and Daniel Bélanger, Wainwright re-recorded three of her own songs in French as well as one by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle.

===&quot;Songs in the Dark&quot;===
In 2015, Wainwright collaborated with her half-sister Lucy Wainwright Roche on the album &quot;Songs in the Dark&quot;. Released under the name The Wainwright Sisters, the album featured a suite of lullabies that their mothers Kate McGarrigle and Suzzy Roche sang to them as children, in addition to songs by Woody Guthrie, Jimmie Rogers, and their father Loudon Wainwright III. Details of the album were announced in September 2015. The song &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; premiered on Speakeasy, a blog affiliated with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, via SoundCloud, on October 7, 2015. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; gave the album four out of five stars and wrote, &quot;if ever an album merited the epithet &#x27;charming&#x27;, this is it.&quot; The album was nominated for Traditional Roots Album of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards.

===&quot;Goodnight City&quot;===
&quot;Goodnight City&quot; was released in November 2016, and received notable praise from Exclaim!, NPR, and The Guardian, who called it &quot;uplifting and powerful.&quot; Unlike previous albums, Martha Wainwright chose to co-write several of the songs on &quot;Goodnight City&quot; with friends and other notable songwriters, including Beth Orton, Glen Hansard, Michael Ondaatje, and Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards. Recorded in Montreal, &quot;Goodnight City&quot; was produced by Thomas Bartlett, who previously worked with Sufjan Stevens and Glen Hansard. The album reached #41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canadian Music charts.

In May 2020, Wainwright released &quot;Wolves&quot;, a duet with Rufus Wainwright that was recorded during the sessions for &quot;Goodnight City&quot;.

===&quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot;===
In 2021, Wainwright released &quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot;, which has been received as her best album since her self-titled debut. &quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot; was made during the pandemic and recorded in Wainwright&#x27;s hometown of Montreal, in the basement of her café-bar, Ursa, which also served as a studio. The songs on the album were largely influenced by her divorce from producer Brad Albetta. Wainwright began writing the album in 2017 after her separation from Albetta. Wainwright has described the album as &quot;more on a broader perspective of themes of life and death, and time and trust and lack of trust, and parenthood and all of these things that sort of seem like a much bigger, broader, perspective and a deeper, more layered life.&quot;

The album features Toronto musicians Thom Gill, Phil Melanson, Morgan Moore, and Josh Cole of Bernice, and was produced by Pierre Marchand, who also produced several of Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle&#x27;s albums. &quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot; received universal acclaim upon its release. Pitchfork wrote that, &quot;&quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot; feels at once bigger and smaller than her previous material, with each quiet rumination leading her toward grander musings on love, grief, and motherhood.&quot; &quot;American Songwriter&quot; wrote that &quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot; &quot;could be considered Martha Wainwright&#x27;s tour de force, a de facto declaration of outrage and emotion shared with full intent and without hesitation,&quot; and hailed that &quot;if artistry is the product of passion, then Wainwright has demonstrated yet again that she&#x27;s capable of channeling it better than most.&quot;

==Other projects==
Martha Wainwright has contributed songs to various soundtracks and compilation albums, including &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; (2005), and &quot;Song of America&quot; (2007).

In 2009, Wainwright appeared on her father&#x27;s album &quot;High Wide &amp; Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project&quot;, which won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album.

Martha Wainwright participated in the 2015 edition of Canada Reads, advocating for Jocelyne Saucier&#x27;s novel &quot;And the Birds Rained Down&quot;.

In 2020, she hosted the television series &quot;Mix sonore&quot;, a bilingual production featuring Canadian musicians. The show was broadcast on the network Unis TV.

In 2019, Wainwright opened a café-bar in Montreal called Ursa on Parc Avenue. Several artists have performed at the venue since it opened, including Patrick Watson, La Force, The Barr Brothers, Rufus Wainwright, and Loudon Wainwright III. Her 2021 album, &quot;Love Will Be Reborn&quot;, was recorded at Ursa during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the pandemic, Wainwright performed a series of rooftop concerts in Montreal. She spearheaded several balcony sing-alongs working alongside POP Montreal, where Montrealers sang at night on their balconies to uniting community anthems, including Leonard Cohens &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; and &quot;I Lost My Baby&quot; by Jean Leloup.

Wainwright released her memoirs in English: &quot;Stories I Might Regret Telling You&quot; and in French: &quot;Rien de grave n&#x27;est encore arrivé&quot; translated by Fanny Britt in the spring of 2022.

==Personal life==
Wainwright married her producer and musical collaborator Brad Albetta in September 2007. They divorced in 2018. They have two sons, Arcangelo and Francis.

<text>Ángel González Muñiz (6 September 1925 – 12 January 2008) was a major Spanish poet of the twentieth century.

== Biography ==
González was born in Oviedo. He took a law degree at the University of Oviedo and, in 1950, moved to Madrid to work in Civil Administration. It was in Madrid that he first began to write and publish his poetry, becoming friends with many of the leading Spanish writers who encouraged his work. His first book of poems, &quot;Áspero mundo&quot; (&quot;Harsh World&quot;), was an immediate critical success. His second book, &quot;Grado elemental&quot; (&quot;Elementary Grade&quot;), was published in Paris and won the prestigious Antonio Machado Prize for Poetry. He published eight more books of poetry and edited several anthologies and books of literary criticism, including critical editions on the poetry of Juan Ramón Jiménez and Antonio Machado. Two books have appeared in English translation: &quot;Harsh World and Other Poems&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1977, translated by Donald Walsh) and &quot;Astonishing World: The Selected Poems of Ángel González&quot; (Milkweed Editions, 1993, translated by Steven Ford Brown).

He is also the recipient of the Angel María de Lera Hispanism Prize for his contributions to Hispanic Culture from the University of Colorado (U.S.), the Príncipe de Asturias Prize (Spain), the Salerno Poetry Prize (Italy) and the Premio Reina Sofía Iberoamericas Prize (Spain). In 1997 he was appointed as the Chair of the Real Academia Española. In 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Federico García Lorca Poetry Prize by the City of Granada. His work is represented in the major anthologies of Spanish poetry of the 20th century, and is also included in the&quot; Vintage Book Of Contemporary World Poetry&quot; (Random House, 1996). He taught at the University of New Mexico from 1974 to 1994. Before his death in January 2008 in Madrid, he divided his time between New Mexico and Spain.

<text>Edward Michael Hanlon (1 October 1887 – 15 January 1952) was an Australian politician and soldier, who was Premier of Queensland from 1946 until his death in 1952.

Hanlon was born in Brisbane in the Colony of Queensland to Irish immigrant parents. He lived there throughout his life. After leaving school, he worked in the railways, and soon became a union official. In the 1912 Brisbane General Strike he played a prominent part as a militant. Between 1915 and 1919 Hanlon served in the 9th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division of the Australian Imperial Force, whose traditions and battle honours are proudly carried by the modern 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment. He served under Captain Cec Carroll during the war; in 1934 Hanlon (then Minister for Home Affairs) would appoint Carroll as the Queensland Police Commissioner.

In 1926 Queensland state election, Hanlon was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly, representing the Labor Party as member for Ithaca. After two decades and several cabinet portfolios (notably the Health Ministry, where he worked in tandem with doctor and administrator Sir Raphael Cilento), he became Queensland&#x27;s Premier, once the septuagenarian Frank Cooper had retired. Over the years Hanlon&#x27;s outlook mellowed, and he shifted to the political right. Having begun as a union militant, he ended up, as Premier, sending the police to suppress union demonstrations during the 1948 Queensland Railway strike.

On 17 June 1951, while in Canberra, Hanlon contracted bronchial pneumonia and spent three weeks in hospital before returning to Queensland on 5 July. On 8 August, Hanlon was admitted to the Mater private hospital and received oxygen. After surviving, doctors warned that Hanlon would be ill for a long period of time. Following this, he took six months&#x27; leave of absence from the premiership. In October, it appeared that Hanlon was well enough to leave the hospital. However, suffering another setback, Hanlon remained in hospital until his death in January 1952.

After his death in January 1952, he was succeeded by Vince Gair, the last leader of the state Labor Party administration which had been in power continuously ever since 1932.

Hanlon was accorded a State funeral which took place from St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral to the Toowong Cemetery.

<text>Sinclair User was a magazine dedicated to the Sinclair Research range of home computers, most specifically the ZX Spectrum (while also occasionally covering arcade games). Initially published by ECC Publications, and later EMAP, it was published in the UK between 1982 and 1993, and was the longest running Sinclair-based magazine. The magazine contained news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, columns, readers&#x27; letters, and cover-mounted game demos.

==History==
In earlier years, the magazine built up personality cults around some of its &quot;hilariously&quot; monikered staff, including Bill &quot;Incorruptible&quot; Scolding, John &quot;Disgusting&quot; Gilbert, Chris &quot;Lunchbreaks&quot; Bourne, Claire &quot;Ligger&quot; Edgely, Richard Price (writer of the &quot;Gordo Greatbelly&quot; adventure tips section), and columnist Andrew Hewson (founder of Hewson Consultants software).

Under David Kelly&#x27;s editorial tenure, the magazine began to focus more on the gaming scene, and featured more colour graphics under designer Gareth &quot;the Mad Celt&quot;. By the time of editor Graham Taylor, the magazine included the cartoon character Kamikaze Bear, and the tone of the publication changed from a semi-serious magazine to something aimed more at children.

High-quality games were indicated in reviews via the &quot;Sinclair User Classic&quot; award, the logo was used as a selling point for games, big and small.

In May 1992 the former rival publication &quot;CRASH&quot; was notionally subsumed into &quot;Sinclair User&quot; but in practice this meant little more than the addition of the &quot;Crash!&quot; logo to the magazine&#x27;s cover page.

==&quot;Timex Sinclair User&quot;==
A short-lived spin-off known as &quot;Timex Sinclair User&quot; was also published for the American market, where versions of Sinclair computers were marketed under the Timex Sinclair name.

<text>A monumental inscription is an inscription, typically carved in stone, on a grave marker, cenotaph, memorial plaque, church monument or other memorial.

The purpose of monumental inscriptions is to serve as memorials to the dead. Those on gravestones are normally placed there by members of the deceased&#x27;s family. Those on memorial plaques inside a religious building are normally placed there by the wider community. The graves of those killed in wars and other armed conflicts are often placed together in military cemeteries in the country where the conflict took place; they are also remembered on war memorials in their own country.

Monumental inscriptions are important to genealogists and family historians, providing information on the subjects life and death, including dates. Family connections can sometimes be resolved as members of the same family may be buried together.

Many old gravestones are now illegible due to weathering, but individuals and family history societies may have recorded their inscriptions and published them, either online, on microfiche or in book form. In England, the Society of Genealogists has a large collection. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has an online database of British and Commonwealth war graves and inscriptions.

<doc id="1120156" wikidata="Q7277900" url="?curid=1120156" title="RTV Palma">
<text>RTV Palma (, &quot;palm tree&quot;) was a privately owned Serbian television station based in Belgrade.

==History==
TV Palma was owned by Palma Ltd, a company set up in October 1991 by Belgrade-based lawyer Miodrag Miki Vujović. On 18 March 1993, TV Palma was launched as Belgrade&#x27;s sixth TV station. Initially, it broadcast on the 39th channel from 17:00 to 02:00, and was one of the first TV stations in Serbia to play hardcore pornography (starting at a quarter to 01:00). The adult segment was later moved to 02:00, but the decision was reversed after public outcry.

Vujović had already been running another TV station on the 34th channel, MV Channel Real Times, from 9 January 1992. The channel broadcast mainly business news and satellite reruns (MTV, Eurosport, The Children&#x27;s Channel) and was sponsored by Jugoskandik, a fraudulent bank run by Jezdimir Vasiljević, Vujović&#x27;s groomsman (&quot;kum&quot;). MV Channel Real Times was initially broadcast from the premises of &quot;Borba&quot;, a newspaper closely aligned with the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia. Also, TV Palma&#x27;s headquarters was initially located on the premises of the SPS near Tašmajdan. Vujović had been renting the office from the party, of which he was also a member. For this reason, it was widely speculated that both TV stations were ideologically closely aligned with the socialists, which was denied by Vujović. By the end of 1993, TV Palma had started broadcasting on the 34th channel, leaving only the graveyard slot reserved for the MV Channel Real Times, which was eventually cancelled altogether.

In 1995, TV Palma tried to transfer to the 12th channel, challenging BK Telecom. The two stations went to court in late August 1995. In October 1995, the government officially granted the 12th channel to BK Telecom.

On 10 February 1997 Miki Vujović and Dragoljub Milanović, general director of RTS, signed a deal stating that the two TV stations would work on the conception and realization of a unified program. Similar deals were signed around that time by other stations, as it allowed them to bypass a public bidding for the bandwidth by aligning their programming with the RTS.

Following the renovation of the Magistrate in Zemun, the Serbian Radical Party, having signed a lease to the building for 30 years on 4 December 1998, signed a sublease to TV Palma. This was considered controversial as the SRS was part of the local government in Zemun at the time, and also subleasing was illegal. In May 2000 Vujović responded to accusations that the station was biased toward the SRS saying that any opposition party could pay for a show such as &quot;Radikalski talasi&quot;, and would be charged half the price.

During the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević on 5 October 2000 TV Palma stopped broadcasting at around 19:05, broadcasting only the message &quot;We cannot continue broadcasting while the city is in flames&quot;. The first guest following the overthrow was Dragoljub Mićunović.

Following investigations by the new local government in Zemun, in June 2001 Federal Minister of Telecommunications Boris Tadić came out with information that three television networks that were &quot;more than close to the SPS&quot; - TV Pink, BK Telecom and TV Palma owed 2,1 million DM in total.

In April 2006 TV Palma and several other TV stations applied for broadcasting rights on the territory of Belgrade. Four NGOs, including the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, put out a statement saying that the council making the decision was &quot;seeming to lose sight of its legal powers and boundaries, manifesting a lack of tolerance and was, akin to earlier ideological commissions, not hiding its intolerance towards media outlets whose editorial policy they did not like&quot;.

In July 2006 the Republic Broadcasting Agency decided that only TV Most, held by SPS member Dušan Bajatović, and TV Palma were denied broadcasting rights. The Democratic Party supported this decision stating that both stations were responsible for hate speech and anti-democratic propaganda during the SPS government. The same month, the Law on Broadcasting was amended giving the RBA the power to seize any frequency that was not awarded to a TV station.

On 26 December 2006 coercive measures were taken by the Republic Broadcasting Agency to prohibit the broadcasting of TV Palma.

During the first half of 2007, and for a short period in May 2008, TV Palma broadcast via satellite.

On 14 July 2007 TV Palma started illegally transmitting from its old transmitter in Zemun on the 36th channel, causing distortions to TV Enter, the station occupying that frequency at the time. Authorities took action and stopped the transmission on 18 July 2007 on the count of piracy.

In March 2009 Palma Ltd took the Republic Broadcasting Agency to court over the fact that the Council of the RBA did not have the legal capacity to prohibit the broadcasting of a TV station, a task normally deferred to Republic Telecommunications Agency. On 4 June 2009 the Supreme Court of Serbia ruled in favor of Palma Ltd. The RBA was forced to reexamine the request from July 2006 and, despite earlier indications, reiterated their earlier decision on 25 January 2010. TV Palma had been broadcasting during this period, starting in December 2009. Vujović even announced he had been planning on a fresh start with a new slogan - &quot;Srpska, a svetska&quot; (&quot;Serbian, yet world-class&quot;).

Starting in late September 2011 TV Palma broadcast via cable (Kopernikus for Belgrade proper, and Avcom for Borča and Krnjača). Its license was revoked on 8 January 2013 as a result of its large accumulated debt.

==Programming==
Early on, TV Palma&#x27;s program consisted mainly of turbo folk music videos. However, after the launch of TV Pink, Palma found it hard to compete and started broadcasting pirated films and satellite TV programs, as well as telenovelas.

Already in 1994, TV Palma started sporadically broadcasting a number of US TV series including Dallas, Dynasty, The Colbys, Barnaby Jones, Remington Steele, The Flying Nun, The Big Valley, Cagney &amp; Lacey, Tales of the Unexpected, Charlie&#x27;s Angels, M*A*S*H, The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill, The Young and Restless, Days of Our Lives and I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan. Later, Palma broadcast a few US teen TV series including Dead at 21 and Kenan &amp; Kel.

By late 1998, TV Palma shifted its focus to broadcasting a number of political and art shows. Around the turn of 1999, the late-night adult program was cancelled.

On 12 December 2000 TV Palma broadcast the first and only interview with Slobodan Milošević following his overthrow. This was condemned by several MPs from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia including Nebojša Čović.

In late 2001 TV Palma canceled all its political shows and started to orient itself to more commercial content. Talk show host Olivera Miletović confirmed in an interview for Ekspres in May 2001 that this was a precondition set by the US before Palma could be allowed to broadcast via satellite.

==In popular culture==
In December 2015 Serbian hip hop artist Mimi Mercedez released a music video for her single &quot;Suši&quot; (&quot;sushi&quot;). The logo of TV Palma was featured prominently, and the image was distorted to resemble turbo folk music videos as an homage to 1990s pop culture in Serbia.

<text>Responsibilities for traditional coast guard duties in Australia are distributed across various federal, state and community agencies. The de facto coast guard of Australia is the Maritime Border Command, a joint command of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Border Force which works alongside the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Each state and territory government have specific maritime safety agencies and police marine units. In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organisations which act as auxiliary search and rescue services and maritime safety educators with the largest organisations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol established in 1937, the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard established in 1961, and Marine Rescue New South Wales established in 2009.

==Federal agencies==
===Maritime Border Command===
The Maritime Border Command is the de facto coast guard of Australia. The Maritime Border Command is a joint unit of the Australian Defence Force (the Royal Australian Navy Patrol Force and the Royal Australian Air Force Surveillance and Response Group) and the Australian Border Force (Marine Unit and Coastwatch aircraft). It is responsible for border protection in the exclusive economic zone of Australia and its 19,650 kilometres of coastline and issues such as illegal fishing and exploitation of natural resources, maritime terrorism and piracy, biosecurity threats, and marine pollution. The Australian Federal Police supports the Maritime Border Command and particularly the Australian Border Force with criminal investigations, law enforcement and national security matters. From August to December 2021, the Maritime Border Command participated in the Royal Australian Navy and OCIUS Bluebottle trial of unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The purpose of the trial was to assess the use of the Bluebottle as a maritime surveillance system to support maritime security. They tested its ability to detect small boats that pose a threat within its area of operation.

===Australian Maritime Safety Authority===
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is responsible for maritime safety and seaworthiness of Australian and foreign vessels in Australian waters including compulsory pilotage, aids to navigation, the Australian Rescue Coordination Centre and coordination of search and rescue operations, and management of Australia&#x27;s international maritime obligations.

===Australian Fisheries Management Authority===
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is responsible for the management and sustainable use of fisheries resources and for combating illegal fishing activities in the Australian Fishing Zone. There are three main branches: Fisheries Operations, Fisheries Management, and Corporate Services. Fisheries Operations is primarily responsible for combating illegal activities, data management, and international communication. Fisheries Management is responsible for economics and policy.

===Office of Transport Security===
The Office of Transport Security has various responsibilities for maritime security.

==State agencies==
Each State Government also has agencies with coast guard responsibilities.

===Queensland===
Marine Rescue Queensland, a branch of the Queensland Police Service, is responsible for maritime safety and rescue.

===Western Australia===
Neither the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol nor the Australian Volunteer Coastguard are active in Western Australia, which is the largest state with the longest coastline. Inshore close to towns the West Australian Police co-ordinate local search and rescue between various state agencies (such as DOT, Fisheries and Water Police). Marine Rescue WA Groups form the core of the system with three main areas of emergency response / search and rescue (SAR), education, and radio monitoring. MR WA groups (37) are part of DFES (Department of Fire and Emergency Services) The 3 largest MR groups are part of DFES including Mandurah the oldest VMR group in WA.
==Community organisations==
In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organizations, the two largest organizations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). These volunteer organizations have no law enforcement powers, and are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. In NSW these two organisations have joined to become Marine Rescue in 2009.

===Marine Rescue NSW===
In November 2008, the NSW Government announced the establishment of a new volunteer marine rescue organisation to be called Marine Rescue NSW, (MRNSW) which was incorporated in July 2009. Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (NSW units) and Volunteer Rescue Association (marine units) united under the new organisation which began operation on 1 January 2010.

Marine Rescue NSW is a charitable organisation similar to the RNLI in Britain. It provides radio and rescue services over New South Wales with 44 units along the coast including two inland units and has over 3000 volunteers. It is also a registered training organisation ensuring that its members are trained and maintain competencies.

The NSW Government imposes an annual levy of $7 both on boat registration and on boat driver licences to provide funds for MRNSW to refurbish and replace old boats and equipment. As at 1 January 2016, MRNSW has refurbished a number of boats and purchased many new purpose-built boats.
MRNSW members are volunteer and in addition to their duties as radio operators, boat crew and many other tasks spend large amounts of time raising funds needed in addition to those provided by the government.

=== Australian Volunteer Coast Guard ===

The Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Association was established in 1961, and modelled on the US Coast Guard Auxiliary, the association is an organisation composed entirely of volunteers. It guards the coast in the most effective way – initially by education, example, examination and finally by search and rescue. The Australian Volunteer Coast Guard has no law enforcement powers. Flotillas and radio bases are located from the Skardon River in the Gulf of Carpentaria, down the eastern seaboard to Ceduna in South Australia, including Tasmania and major inland lakes and weirs. Coast Guard currently has more than 2,500 Regular members and 9,000 Associate members. Expansion is continuing in areas of need.
Australian Volunteer Coast Guard resources across Australia include:
*107 Association-owned rescue vessels
*147 radio bases under the control of 72 local flotillas
*30 communication and display vans and 4WD vehicles
*Registered Training Organisations delivering competency based training
*Formal affiliations and collaborations with similar organisations in Australia, New Zealand, North America, the Philippines and Europe.

=== Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol ===
In 1936 Commander Rupert Long, OBE, RAN, Director of Naval Intelligence raised with retired Captain Maurice Blackwood, DSO, RN the possibility of raising a group of trained yachtsmen as a Naval Auxiliary Service. Discussions were held with HWG Nobbs and W Giles, both Sydney yachtsmen and a proposal sent to the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board that a Volunteer Coastal Patrol be established under the command of Captain Blackwood. The Naval Board supported this and on 27 March 1937 the Volunteer Coastal Patrol was established under the command of Captain Blackwood, DSO, RN (rtd) with H.W.G. Nobbs as Staff Officer Operations and W Giles as Staff Officer Administration.

During World War II Coastal Patrol members became special constables and guarded commercial wharves, oil installations and bridges. By the war&#x27;s end, patrol vessels had patrolled 128,000 miles of harbour and coastal waters and donated 393,000-man-hours of unpaid war service. They were granted the right to fly the Police Nemesis pennant as recognition of this service and the right to fly the New South Wales State Flag as their ensign.

Post war development saw the Patrol undertake civilian search and rescue operations as their primary role but maintain their original Royal Australian Navy inspired organisation structure, ranks and uniform. 1955 saw a democratically elected council formed which directed the development and administration of the Patrol and appointed the Officer Commanding. 1963 saw the Patrol become an incorporated company and the articles of association written. In 1974, Her Majesty the Queen granted the Patrol the privilege of adding the Royal prefix to its title when it became the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (RVCP).
In 2008 the NSW State Government after strong representations by RVCP agreed to the amalgamation of the three volunteer rescue organisations (RVCP, Volunteer Rescue Association (marine sections) and Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (NSW units) into one organisation which became Volunteer Marine Rescue NSW (VMRNSW) and commenced operation on 1 January 2010.
Today VMRNSW works closely with all government agencies in search and rescue and education to the boating public. They maintain constant watch in Radio Bases for marine traffic, work with the Water Police in search and rescue as well as crowd control at major maritime events, run education classes in seamanship, navigation, first aid and meteorology for the public as well as providing constant information to Radio Stations and TV stations regarding sea conditions etc.
The NSW Government imposes an annual levy of $7 on boat registration and boat driver licences to fund the operation of VMRNSW which has enabled the replacement and refurbishment of many old boats and equipment. All members of the Patrol are volunteers with a large proportion of their time devoted to raising funds needed in addition to the government provision.

== Proposals for an Australian Coast Guard ==
After the Tampa affair, and the declaration of the War on Terrorism, in 2001 Kim Beazley announced that the Australian Labor Party, if in government, would establish an Australian Coast Guard &quot;responsible for conducting Australia&#x27;s coastal surveillance and meeting Australia&#x27;s maritime protection needs, including in relation to illegal immigration, drugs, fisheries, and quarantine-related issues&quot;. This plan met with criticism. Peter Reith criticised Beazley for stating that an Australian Coast Guard both will and will not be an &quot;answer to the question of people smuggling&quot;. The plan was criticised by the Australian government, on the grounds that it would either be prohibitively expensive or inadequate to the task. Later, the motives for the establishment of an Australian Coast Guard were interpreted by some as &quot;a plan to extend the capabilities of the Australian Federal Police.&quot;

<text>Ange-Jacques Gabriel (; 23 October 1698 – 4 January 1782) was the principal architect of King Louis XV of France. His major works included the Place de la Concorde, the École Militaire, and the Petit Trianon and opera theater at the Palace of Versailles. His style was a careful balance between French Baroque architecture and French neoclassicism.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Ange-Jacques Gabriel was born on 23 October 1698, to a famous Parisian family of architects, and was connected by marriage with another celebrated architect of the time, François Mansart. His grandfather was an architect, and his father, Jacques Gabriel (1667-1742) received the title of Controller of the Buildings of the King at the age of twenty-one. His father&#x27;s major projects included the Hôtel de Ville de Rennes and the Place Royale (now Place de la Bourse) in Bordeaux. The young Ange-Jacques became a member of the Académie royale d&#x27;architecture in 1728, and assisted his father on the Place de la Bourse. He became the principal assistant to his father as &quot;Premier Architecte&quot; at the Versailles from 1735 and, after his father&#x27;s death, succeeded him as chief architect of the King.

In his new position, he served under the supervision of two successive Directors of the Buildings of the King, Charles François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem and Abel-François Poisson, Marquis de Marigny, the brother of the King&#x27;s mistress and cultural advisor, Madame de Pompadour.

===Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde)===

The Place Louis XV, today&#x27;s Place de la Concorde was conceived in 1748 and completed in 1772, and was Gabriel&#x27;s first major project. He was asked to find a compromise between several competing plans for the development of the marshy land between the gates of the Tuileries Garden and the new Champs-Élysées, on land donated by the King. Gabriel&#x27;s design, combining elements of the earlier schemes, left the view toward the Seine open, and preserved unobstructed the long axis between the Tuileries and the Champs-Élysées. On the north side of the Place, he built two symmetrical palaces, leaving a gap between them, creating a new north–south axis, the Rue Rye Royale, connecting the Place to the Madeleine church, then under construction. The façades of the palaces, with rows of Corinthian columns, were modeled after the colonnades of the Louvre. 
The centerpiece of the square was an equestrian statue of Louis XV. The project was finalized in 1754 and was completed in 1763. The statue of Louis XV was removed during the French Revolution, and the obelisk, statues and fountains were added in the 19th century.

===École Militaire===

Louis XV decided in 1751 to create the École Militaire, the first French military academy, to train five hundred young men from poor noble families &quot;gentlemen&quot; in the art of warfare. The site chosen was next to the plain of Grenelle, on the left bank to the west of the city center. Gabriel&#x27;s plan called for a &quot;château&quot; with two wings flanking a central pavilion with a dome, similar to that of the Louvre. The building featured a façade with a colonnade of the Doric order, and to the rear had a large courtyard with a façade of superimposed orders of columns, opening onto Place de Fontenoy. A chapel was artfully integrated into the architecture of the main building. The interior featured a lavishly-decorated salon, now the &quot;Salle des Marechals&quot;, connected to the grand floor by a majestic ramp, and the Chapel of Louis IX, or Saint Louis, the patron saint of the Army. Two additional wings along Avenue de la Motte-Piquet were added in the 19th century.

===Petit Trianon===

At the request of Madame de Pompadour, Gabriel had made plans for a smaller pavilion at Versailles away from the main palace and the Grand Trianon. With the end of the expensive Seven Years&#x27; War Louis XV approved the plans, and between 1763 and 1768 the Petit Trianon was constructed. The building was cubic, and each façade was different; each was decorated with pilasters, columns and pediments in perfect proportion and harmony. The façades of the Petit Trianon represented in its most pure form the emerging style of Neoclassicism in France.

===Royal Opera of Versailles===

Much of his attention was devoted to modifications of the Palace of Versailles desired by Louis XV. The palace lacked a proper opera theater; a theater had been commanded under Louis XIV in 1682 for the end of the North Wing but the project had been put on hold due to its cost of the King&#x27;s wars and the complexity of meeting the needs of the Court. Gabriel made a new proposal for the same site in 1748, but it was also put on hold due to the cost. Gabriel subsequently occupied himself with numerous modifications to the exterior of the palace, notably the completion and extension of the North Wing, following closely the original designs of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, completed in 1764.

The Opera project was revived in 1765 and was accelerated in 1770 for the celebrations of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, to the Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria. To finish the project quickly and at lower cost, the theater was made entirely of wood, painted to resemble marble, but also giving it exceptionally good acoustics. The theater was in blue and gold, made in shape of truncated ellipse or oval, surrounded by tiers of boxes, decorated with carved and gilded wood, illuminated by three thousand candles whose light was reflected in mirrors. By this time Louis XV had a new mistress, Madame du Barry, and the royal box, the size of three ordinary boxes, had a grill to protect their privacy. Sculptures by Augustin Pajou and a painted ceiling by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau completed the interior. Gabriel and his chief architectural engineer, Blaise Arnaud, studied installing a mechanism to hoist the floor of the theater up to the level of the stage, to create an enormous ballroom, but this was never completed.

===Death===
His final projects were the completion of the façades of the buildings he designed for the Place de la Concorde; the former Hôtel de Coislin, and the Hotel Crillon, finished in 1770. and the building of what today is the Hôtel de la Marine, the headquarters of the French Navy until 2016, which was finished in 1774.
He died in Paris in 1782.

==Style==
His sober rationality in planning and detail promoted the transition from Rococo to Neoclasscism. He was not especially known for boldness or originality; borrowing extensively from the French classicism and early classical models, particularly from the Louvre. He was known for his craftsmanship, his ability to balance the animation of the Baroque style with the more restrained neoclassicism, the proportions and balance and careful detail of his buildings, and his ability to create dramatic and harmonious ensembles of monumental buildings, as he did in the Place de la Concorde.

<doc id="1120159" wikidata="Q2453955" url="?curid=1120159" title="The Musketeers of Pig Alley">
<text>The Musketeers of Pig Alley is a 1912 American short drama and a gangster film. It is directed by D. W. Griffith and written by Griffith and Anita Loos. It is also credited for its early use of follow focus, a fundamental tool in cinematography.

The film was released on October 31, 1912, and re-released on November 5, 1915, in the United States. The film was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey where many other early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century. Location shots in New York City reportedly used actual street gang members as extras during the film.

It was also shown in Leeds Film Festival in November 2008, as part of &quot;Back to the Electric Palace&quot;, with live music by Gabriel Prokofiev, performed in partnership with Opera North.

In 2016, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
The film is about a poor married couple living in New York City. The husband works as a musician and must often travel for work. When returning, his wallet is taken by a gangster. His wife goes to a ball where a man tries to drug her, but his attempt is stopped by the same man who robbed the husband. The two criminals become rivals, and a shootout ensues. The husband gets caught in the shootout and recognizes one of the men as the gangster who took his money. The husband sneaks his wallet back and the gangster goes to safety in the couple&#x27;s apartment. Policemen track the gangster down but the wife gives him a false alibi.

<text>The Telmac 1800 is an early microcomputer that was delivered in kit form. It was introduced in 1977 by Telercas Oy, the Finnish importer of RCA microchips. Most of the 2,000 kits manufactured over four years were bought by electronics enthusiasts in Finland, Sweden and Norway.

An expansion board, OSCOM, later became available, and included an alphanumeric video display, and up to of memory. A Tiny BASIC could be run on this configuration.

The first-ever commercial video game to be developed in Finland, &quot;Chesmac&quot;, was developed by Raimo Suonio on a Telmac 1800 computer in 1979.

The Telmac 1800 was followed by the Oscom Nano and the Telmac 2000.

<text>Ohud Hospital is a 280-bed hospital in the outskirts of Madinah Al Munawwara, Saudi Arabia. It is located adjacent to the large air conditioning and electricity complex that supplies Masjid Al-Nabawi. The hospital also contains a residential campus where the hospital doctors reside. Nurses quarters are also located on site.

It started its life in 1405 as a charity hospital called Badr Al-Khairi and because it was well constructed and neat, it was taken over by the ministry of health. An identical campus is also located on the outskirts of Madinah.

<text>The Matrimandir is an edifice of spiritual significance for practitioners of integral yoga, in the centre of Auroville established by the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. It is called &quot;Soul of the City&quot; (French: &quot;L&#x27;âme de la ville&quot;) and is situated in a large open space called &quot;Peace&quot;.

==Structure and surroundings==
The Matrimandir took 37 years to build, from the laying of the foundation stone at sunrise on 21 February 1971 - the Mother&#x27;s 93rd birthday - to its completion in May 2008. It is in the form of a huge sphere surrounded by twelve petals. The Geodesic dome is covered by golden discs and reflects sunlight, which gives the structure its characteristic radiance. Inside the central dome is a meditation hall known as the &quot;inner chamber&quot; - this contains the largest optically-perfect glass globe in the world. The Matrimandir, and its surrounding gardens in the central Peace Area, is open to the public by appointment.

The four main pillars that support the structure of Matrimandir, and carry the Inner Chamber, have been set at the four main directions of the compass. These four pillars are symbolic of the four aspects of the mother as described by Sri Aurobindo, and are named after these four aspects.

<doc id="1120168" wikidata="Q753091" url="?curid=1120168" title="Crash (magazine)">
<text>Crash, stylized as CRASH, is a magazine dedicated to the ZX Spectrum home computer, primarily focused on games. It was published from 1984 to 1991 by Newsfield Publications Ltd until their liquidation, and then until 1992 by Europress. It was relaunched as a quarterly A5 magazine in December 2020 with the backing of the original founders.

The magazine was launched to cater for the booming Spectrum games market. It was immediately popular owing to its quality of writing and distinctive, though occasionally controversial, artwork created by Oliver Frey. By 1986 it had become the biggest-selling British computer magazine with over 100,000 copies sold monthly, but struggled towards the end of the decade after other magazines put cassettes of games on the front cover. In the 2010s, a number of retrospective issues were created via a kickstarter campaign leading to the new publication by Fusion Retro.

==History==

&quot;Crash&quot; was launched in 1983 in Ludlow, Shropshire by Roger Kean, Oliver Frey and Franco Frey. The trio had met the previous year when they were working for newspaper publisher Alan Purnell, learning how to write and produce a magazine from scratch. Franco Frey had worked for an electronics company, and had been asked by one of his business contacts if could get hold of video games. Kean remembers that &quot;The High Street was ignorant of computer games&quot; and they wanted to source titles and sell them. They set up a mail order catalogue called &quot;Crash Micro Games Action&quot; and advertised in contemporary computer magazines such as &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. It was immediately successful, so by late 1983, they decided to launch a dedicated magazine, forming the company Newsfield to do so. Kean and Oliver Frey wanted a catchy title for the magazine, choosing &quot;Crash&quot; after J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel of the same name.

Though he had regularly played video games throughout the 1970s, the middle-aged Kean realised that the target market for the magazine was teenagers and young men, and the writing needed to accommodate this. Consequently, he hired teenage staff writer Matthew Uffindel and the pair recruited local schoolchildren to review the games, including Ben Stone and Robin Candy. To produce screenshots, a camera was set up to directly capture the television set or monitor that the Spectrum was plugged into. The film was then processed in-house, printed and delivered to a local print shop to prepare the final page.

The first issue was intended to be published in November 1983, in time for the pre-Christmas trade, but owing to a conflict with retailers WH Smith it was published in February the following year. The magazine maintained focus squarely on Spectrum gaming. It was an instant hit thanks to Oliver Frey&#x27;s artwork and Kean&#x27;s writing, assisted by Uffindel. Kean and the Frey brothers would continue to be involved with the magazine throughout its lifetime.

Reviewers would give their direct opinions on whether a game was good or not, regardless of advertising or any pressure from software houses. Though publishers sometimes tried to bribe the magazine editors to give games good reviews, the children would not do that, and once gave a game a low score of 9%. This honesty gave &quot;Crash&quot; a good reputation and made it highly influential in the games industry. If a game was awarded a &quot;Crash Smash&quot; (an overall rating of 90% or above), the industry believed it was genuinely good and it would sell well. The logo was used in advertisements for games, big and small. Notable Crash Smashes included &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; and &quot;Head over Heels&quot;. In 1986, Gremlin Graphics published a compilation, &quot;Four Crash Smashes&quot;, which featured &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;, &quot;Alien 8&quot;, &quot;Dun Darach&quot; and &quot;Night Gunner&quot;.

In October 1986, &quot;Crash&quot; reported sales of over 100,000 copies. Its ABC figure of 101,483 copies a month for the period of January to June were claimed by the magazine to be higher than any other British computer magazine.

By 1989, rival Spectrum magazine &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; regularly came with a free cassette attached to the cover that contained a complete game and various demos. &quot;Crash&quot; had occasionally featured cassettes on the cover, but began to lag in circulation. It was relaunched that June with a free cover-mounted cassette with a number of complete games, which continued as a regular feature. This came at the expense of page count and editorial content, both of which were reduced. Kean was annoyed by having to put tapes on the cover to keep up with the competition, as it increased costs and obscured Frey&#x27;s cover artwork.

Newsfield was suffering increasing financial difficulties by the early 1990s. The last edition of &quot;Crash&quot; published by the company was in September 1991. Following the company&#x27;s liquidation, the magazine was relaunched by Europress that December, continuing until the final issue in April 1992. After this, &quot;Crash&quot; was bought by EMAP, publisher of &quot;Sinclair User&quot;, who merged the two magazines. In practice, this meant little more than the appearance of the &quot;Crash&quot; logo on the front cover.

In May 2016, No. 2 King Street, Ludlow was awarded a Blue plaque as the premises of Newsfield while it was publishing &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;ZZap!64&quot; from 1984–9, which both hired pupils from Ludlow Church of England School alongside professional journalists.

In 2017, the magazine was commemorated in a special exhibition in Ludlow Buttercross Museum documenting Newsfield&#x27;s contribution to the local industry. The same year, a special edition of the magazine was issued following a Kickstarter campaign that raised £12,000. Kean, Oliver Frey and Nick Roberts all returned to contribute to this issue. The following year, a similar campaign led to the 2019 &quot;Crash&quot; annual – issue 100. The magazine was relaunched as an A5 quarterly publication in December 2020.

==Cover art==

&quot;Crash&quot; featured distinctive cover art, mostly drawn by Oliver Frey. Much of his work was published in book form for the first time in 2006.

The cover of issue 18, July 1985, which depicted a scantily clad sorceress with a man on his knees in collar and chains, was considered provocative by some shops who moved it to the top shelf. Issue 31 in August 1986 was criticised for the front cover featuring staff writer Hannah Smith in a swimsuit mud wrestling with an alien. The cover of issue 41, June 1987, was a particularly violent image depicting two barbarians fighting, with one about to slit the throat of another. The picture was deemed too strong by W H Smith and that issue was relegated to the top shelves. However, these controversial covers helped boost the sales of &quot;Crash&quot;, particularly doubling the circulation from 1985 to 1986.

==Editorial content==
Much editorial content (such as previews and responses to readers&#x27; letters) was credited to Lloyd Mangram, a fictional character, although written by members of the editorial staff. He was created by the team simply to make the magazine look more important and professional by appearing to have a greater number of writers, and named after golfer Lloyd Mangrum. On one occasion, Mangram was depicted visually in the magazine by a sketch of a man wearing a paper bag over his head with holes cut for eyes, and was reported to work on a Hermes typewriter.

The &quot;Playing Tips&quot; section featured solutions to games cheats to make them easier. Candy was a regular host of this section in its early years. Issue 27 in April 1986 included a special &quot;Robin Candy&#x27;s Playing Tips&quot; supplement of cheats and game modifications, including a room editor for the Crash Smash game &quot;Sweevo&#x27;s World&quot;. Following Candy&#x27;s departure, Hannah Smith ran the section as a self-styled &quot;girlie tipster&quot;, establishing a rivalry with fictional Melissa Ravenflame from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. Nick Roberts began his role in the magazine editing this section after Smith, and stayed for the remainder of its run, working out POKEs (alterations to the game&#x27;s machine code in memory that allowed a player to cheat) using a Multiface, a Spectrum hardware add-on. The magazine also covered technical information and stories about future hardware and peripherals in its &quot;Tech Niche&quot; and &quot;Tech Tips&quot; sections, the latter frequently written by Simon N Goodwin. In 1988, a special &quot;Tech Tape&quot; was released, containing utilities and programs associated with this section.
&quot;Crash&quot; included the occasional column which seemed unusual for a computer magazine. Its first year saw the launch of both the &quot;Lunar Jetman&quot; strip (written and illustrated by John Richardson, based on the character from the games by Ultimate Play the Game) and &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;, an original piece of fiction written by Kelvin Gosnell and illustrated by Oliver Frey. Later years would see a brief revival of &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;, as well as Mel Croucher&#x27;s comic story &quot;Tamara Knight&quot;, both of which ended mid-run. After the closure of Newsfield&#x27;s short-lived lifestyle magazine &quot;LM&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot; inherited its video reviews for a short period.

The August 1985 issue of &quot;Crash&quot; featured &quot;Unclear User&quot;, a spoof on rival magazine &quot;Sinclair User&quot;. This led to a successful injunction being taken out against the magazine two days before the official publication date on the grounds of copyright infringement. Copies were withdrawn from newsagents and an apology published in the following issue. Readers were also offered a back issue with the offending pages removed at a reduced price and priority delivery.

==Readers awards==
Starting in 1984, the magazine published an annual readers awards article, based on votes from the readers.

<doc id="1120181" wikidata="Q2075823" url="?curid=1120181" title="Murphy bed">
<text>A Murphy bed (also known as a pull-down bed, fold-down bed, or wall bed) is a bed that is hinged at one end to store vertically against the wall, or inside a closet or cabinet. Since they often can be used as both a bed or a closet, Murphy beds are multifunctional furniture.

==History==

The Murphy bed is named after William Lawrence Murphy (1876–1957), president of the Murphy Bed and Door Company.

===Pre-Murphy folding beds===

Under the name &quot;bureau bedstead&quot; the fold-up bed appeared in the eighteenth century, but never gained popularity. When closed, the bed looked like a bureau with fake drawers, hence the name. Gloag points to three eighteenth century pieces: one manufactured by Gillows of Lancaster and London in 1788, another one advertised by John Taylor in 1769, and the third one with a description published in the &quot;Prices for Cabinet Work&quot; in 1797.

A foldup bed was exhibited in the US by Sarah E. Goode in 1884, and foldup beds were offered through the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. catalog in 1895, before Murphy&#x27;s inventions.

===Murphy===
Murphy applied for his first patents around 1900. According to legend, he was wooing an opera singer, but living in a one-room apartment in San Francisco, and the moral code of the time frowned upon a woman entering a man&#x27;s bedroom. Murphy&#x27;s invention converted his bedroom into a parlor, enabling him to entertain.

Murphy introduced pivot and counterbalanced designs for which he received a series of patents, including one for a &quot;Disappearing Bed&quot; on June 18, 1912, and another for a &quot;Design for a Bed&quot; on June 27, 1916.

Murphy beds are used for space-saving purposes, much like trundle beds, and are popular where floor space is limited, such as small houses, apartments, hotels, mobile homes and college dormitories. In recent years, Murphy bed units have included options such as lighting, storage cabinets, and office components. They saw a resurgence in popularity in the early 2010s due to the weak economy, with children moving back in with their parents and families choosing to renovate homes rather than purchasing larger ones.

In 1989, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the term &quot;Murphy Bed&quot; had entered common usage so thoroughly that it was no longer eligible for trademark protection.

==Designs and models==
Few Murphy beds have box springs. Instead, the mattress usually lies on a wood platform or wire mesh and is held in place so as not to sag when in a closed position. The mattress is attached to the bed frame, often with elastic straps to hold the mattress in position when the unit is folded upright. Pistons-lifts or torsion springs make modern Murphy beds easy to lower and raise.
Since the first model several other variations and designs have been created, including: sideways-mounted Murphy beds, Murphy bunk beds, and solutions that include other functions. Murphy beds exist with tables or desks that fold down when the bed is folded up, and there are also models with sofas and shelving solutions.

==Risks==
If not secured or used properly, a Murphy bed could collapse on the operator. A 1945 court case in Illinois found that a tenant assumed the risk of injury from a wall bed installed in a rented inn room. In 1982, a drunk man suffocated inside a closed Murphy bed, and two women were entrapped and suffocated by an improperly installed wall bed in 2005. A 2014 lawsuit alleged that a defective Murphy bed led to the death of a Staten Island man. In April 2022, Bestar Wall Beds of Quebec, Canada, recalled 129,000 beds in the United States and 53,000 beds in Canada after a 79-year-old woman was killed and 60 others injured by falling beds. Later that year, Cyme Tech, also of Quebec, Canada, recalled 8,200 beds after 146 reports of falling beds resulting in 62 injuries.

==In popular culture==
Murphy beds were a common setup for comic scenes in early cinema, including in silent films. The earliest known film to feature a Murphy bed is the lost 1900 Biograph Company film &quot;A Bulletproof Bed&quot;, which was remade in 1903 by Edison Pictures as the extant film &quot;Subub Surprises the Burglar&quot;. It was a recurrent slapstick element in many Keystone Studios productions of the 1910s, including &quot;Cursed by His Beauty&quot; (1914), &quot;Fatty&#x27;s Reckless Fling&quot; (1915), &quot;He Wouldn&#x27;t Stay Down&quot; (1915), and &quot;Bath Tub Perils&quot; (1916). Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 1916 &quot;One AM&quot; also features an exaggerated encounter with a Murphy bed.

Murphy beds were a routine enough feature of comic film to invite commentary from retailers. One store based in Vancouver, British Columbia remarked in an advertisement, &quot;Gone are the days of Laurel and Hardy where the beds were portrayed as a fold away trap for your worst enemies.&quot;

In comics, the Murphy bed is depicted in the &quot;Tintin&quot; book &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; as being an invention of Professor Calculus.

<text>Guto Harri (; born 8 July 1966) is a Welsh broadcaster, writer and strategic communications consultant. He most recently served as Downing Street Director of Communications, having been appointed by Boris Johnson in February 2022. 

Harri spent 18 years as a journalist at the BBC. From 2008 to 2012 he was director of external affairs for Mayor of London Boris Johnson. He worked at News International from 2012 to 2015, Liberty Global from 2016 to 2017, Hanover Communications from 2018 to 2020, and Hawthorn Advisors from 2020 to 2022. 

In May 2021, Harri joined GB News as a presenter; he was suspended and resigned in July 2021 after he took the knee on air. In February 2022, Harri was appointed Downing Street Director of Communications by Prime Minister Johnson, following the resignation of Jack Doyle, and left the post in September 2022.

==Early life and education==
Guto Harri was born in Cardiff to writer and psychiatrist Harri Pritchard-Jones and Lenna (née Harries). A native Welsh speaker, he studied at Tonyrefail School and Ysgol Bryntaf, before attending Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari. After school Harri attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. He then undertook a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism at Cardiff University.

==Career==
===Television===
He started his career in Welsh-language radio before moving into network radio and television. He remained a regular contributor on the S4C news programme &quot;Newyddion&quot; (“News”) as well as on a number of historical documentaries for S4C. He later presented a number of BBC Wales&#x27; main election programmes.

Harri was a regular presenter on BBC television and radio programmes such as &quot;The World at One&quot;, &quot;Westminster Live&quot;, Straight Talk, &quot;Despatch Box&quot; and &quot;The World This Weekend&quot;. He covered the collapse of communism in Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany before reporting on the Gulf War from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and northern Iraq. He became the BBC&#x27;s chief political correspondent in November 2002 and also presented the weekly interview programme, &quot;One To One&quot;. He moved briefly to Rome from July 2004 to January 2005 and then became North America business correspondent based in New York City until June 2007.

Harri was appointed as a trustee of S4C in 2014, and he was a member of the S4C Authority from 2014 to 2018.

Since June 2018, he has presented the S4C current affairs television programme, &quot;Y Byd yn ei Le&quot;. S4C confirmed that he would not continue hosting the programme following his appointment as Downing Street Director of Communications.

In May 2021, it was announced that Harri would be joining GB News as co-host of a weekly news and discussion programme. On 13 July 2021, Harri took the knee on GB News to show support for the England football team&#x27;s kneeling for anti-racism; following backlash from viewers, GB News suspended him indefinitely for failing to maintain the editorial standards expected by the network. Shortly afterwards, he resigned from GB News, having written in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that the channel was &quot;becoming an absurd parody&quot; that was replicating cancel culture on the far right.

===Public relations===
After leaving the BBC at the end of 2007, he was approached to work for Conservative Party leader David Cameron, but joined London public relations agency Fleishman-Hillard as a senior policy advisor, reportedly spending four days as an adviser to Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. 

In May 2008, he was appointed communications director for Mayor of London Boris Johnson&#x27;s administration at London City Hall. Harri joined News UK in May 2012 as a director of communications and corporate affairs, but left in December 2015, remarking that he was leaving with the &quot;job done&quot; after the fallout over phone hacking at the company.

He then joined Virgin Media owner Liberty Global in February 2016 as their managing director of external communications. He left the role in December 2017.

In May 2018, Harri took a part-time role with London PR firm Hanover Communications as a vice president, for &quot;GQ&quot; magazine as a contributing political editor, and also for Hydro Industries, a water treatment company based in Llanelli where he is a director.

===Brexit/Boris Johnson===
Harri is a critic of Brexit. After Johnson likened Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s Chequers Brexit agreement to a &quot;suicide vest&quot; around the British constitution in September 2018, Harri criticised Johnson for &quot;[joking] about suicide vests&quot; and being &quot;sexually incontinent&quot;, saying he was &quot;digging his political grave&quot; with his comments. He also said Johnson had become &quot;more tribal, and tribal within the tribe, so that he would now be—if he were to become leader—a hugely divisive figure&quot;.

Harri was a board director of Hawthorn Advisors, a communications consultancy based in London and co-founded by Conservative Party co-chair Ben Elliot in 2013. Hawthorn advised and lobbied the government on behalf of Huawei, a firm with close ties to the Chinese government that has been accused of spying on 5G networks in the UK and other Western nations. Harri personally met with top executives from Huawei, including the company&#x27;s vice-president, in 2020.

Harri was critical of Boris Johnson over parties held in Downing Street and Westminster during COVID-19 lockdowns, although he has argued that people were losing their &quot;sense of perspective&quot; over the controversy. After a wave of resignations from Boris Johnson&#x27;s team at 10 Downing Street in February 2022 in light of the scandal, he became Downing Street Director of Communications, replacing Jack Doyle.

Harri left his Director of Communications post on 6 September 2022, the same day that Johnson resigned as Prime Minister.

==Family and personal life==
Harri grew up in Rhondda Cynon Taf. He married his wife, Shireen, in 2000 and has three children. In 2005, Harri published an advertisement in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; seeking a Welsh-speaking nanny for their two children while he worked for the BBC in New York City, in which he argued for the importance of the language in bringing up his children. Outside work he says he enjoys rowing, sailing, fishing and cooking.

Harri is a non-executive board member of the Hay Festival. He was previously a trustee for UK-based cultural non-governmental organisation Visiting Arts. Harri is trained and serves as a volunteer crew member on the River Thames for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He holds an honorary doctorate from the University of South Wales.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2022 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours for political and public service.

<doc id="1120185" wikidata="Q1158126" url="?curid=1120185" title="House of Khalifa">
<text>The House of Khalifa () is the ruling family of the Kingdom of Bahrain. They profess Sunni Islam and belong to the Anizah tribe. Some members of this tribe joined the Utub alliance which migrated from Najd in central Arabia to Kuwait, then ruled all of Qatar, more specifically Al Zubarah, which they built and ruled over before settling in Bahrain in the early 17th century. The current head of the family is King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999 and proclaimed himself King of Bahrain in 2002, in fact becoming a constitutional monarch.

As of 2010, roughly half of the serving cabinet ministers of Bahrain were members of the Al Khalifa royal family, while the country&#x27;s Prime Minister, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, is also from the Al Khalifa family and is the son of the current King.

==History ==
Bahrain fell under the control of Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa in 1783, following the defeat of Nasr Al-Madhkur who ruled the archipelago as a dependency of Persia (see Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain). Ahmed ruled Bahrain as hakim until 1796, but was based in Zubarah (in modern-day Qatar) and spent summers in Bahrain. Ahmed was the first hakim of Bahrain and the progenitor of the ruling Al Khalifa family of Bahrain. All of the Al Khalifa rulers of Bahrain are his descendants.

Ahmed had four children. Following his death in 1796, two of his sons, Salman and Abdulla, moved to Bahrain, and co-ruled it as feudal estates and imposed taxes on the indigenous Baharnah population. Salman settled in Bahrain Island and Abdulla in Muharraq Island, each ruling independently. The Al Khalifa soon became split into two branches, Al-Abdulla and Al-Salman that engaged in open conflict between 1842 and 1846. The Al-Salman branch was victorious and enjoyed complete rule of Bahrain. Until 1869, Bahrain was under threat of occupation by various external powers including the Wahhabis, Omanis, Ottomans, Egyptians and Persians, yet the Al Khalifa managed to keep it under their control. The Al-Abdulla branch continued to be a cause of threat until 1895. Today, Abdulla ibn Ahmad Al Khalifa descendants live in Qatar, while Salman ibn Ahmad Al Khalifa&#x27;s descendants live in Bahrain.

==List of Al Khalifa rulers of Bahrain==
Since 1783, the Al Khalifa have been rulers of Bahrain:

==Family tree==








==Ruling Family Council==
Decisions pertaining to the Al Khalifa family, as well as disputes between family members are arbitrated by the Ruling Family Council (). The council attends to internal family disputes particularly those related to appropriation of land, sale of real estate and other properties. Members of the ruling family are not allowed to refer these or other disputes to ordinary law courts.

Relations between the political leadership and the rest of the &quot;rank and file&quot; members of the Al Khalifa ruling family have been formally managed by the council since 1932. However, on the eve of the 1973 parliamentary elections, then the Amir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa issued a decree restructuring the Ruling Family Council to become a formal organ of the state, and giving the administrative head of the council the rank of minister.

The Ruling Family Council is chaired by King Hamad, its deputy chairman is Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Hamad Al Khalifa, and the director general is Ibrahim bin Khalid bin Mohammed Al Khalifa.

The King appoints the members of the board of the Ruling Family Council as recognised representatives of various kingship lines and factional alliances within the Al Khalifa family.

==Cabinet ministers==
As of 2024, 4 out of 25 serving cabinet ministers of Bahrain were members of the Al Khalifa royal family.

* Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Prime Minister, The Crown Prince, and Deputy Supreme Commander
* Shaikh Khalid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Deputy Prime Minister
* Shaikh Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa, Minister of Interior
* Shaikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, Minister of Finance and National Economy

==Notable people==

*Shaikha Dheya bint Ebrahim Al Khalifa, royal family member and President of the Riyada Group of Companies

==Controversies==
The King of Bahrain, King Al Khalifa was responsible for attacks on protesters during the Arab Spring. He and the Bahraini government were condemned both locally and overseas. He later enlisted the help of nearby Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The current rector of the university, appointed by the Presidency on 24 June 2020, is Mehmet Cahit Güran.

==History==

The history of Hacettepe University dates back to the establishment of the Institute of Child Health on 8 July 1958, along with the inauguration of the Hacettepe Children&#x27;s Hospital, founded by Prof. Dr. İhsan Doğramacı. In 1961, the School of Health Sciences was established, encompassing divisions of Nursing, Medical Technology, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, and Nutrition, all centered around the Institute of Child Health.

On 15 June 1963, the Faculty of Medicine at Hacettepe University was founded, accompanied by the construction of a general teaching hospital. Three months later, the School of Dentistry was established. In the summer of 1964, the School of Basic Sciences opened, offering courses in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. During this period, all teaching institutions of Hacettepe were affiliated with Ankara University and collectively referred to as the &quot;Hacettepe Science Center.&quot;

Hacettepe University was officially established through Act No. 892 of the Turkish Parliament on 8 July 1967. The core institutions of Hacettepe University were the Hacettepe Institutes of Higher Education, and the Faculties of Medicine, Science and Engineering, and Social and Administrative Sciences were founded. In 1969, the School of Pharmacy and the School of Health Administration were established. In 1971, a reorganization led to the elevation of these schools to faculty status, resulting in the creation of the Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Pharmacy, and Faculty of Science. The School of Technology was established in 1973.

In 1982, a further reorganization led to the formation of the Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Fine Arts, and Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences.

<doc id="1120207" wikidata="Q2046065" url="?curid=1120207" title="Law enforcement in Australia">
<text>Law enforcement in Australia is one of the three major components of the country&#x27;s justice system, along with courts and corrections. Law enforcement officers are employed by all three levels of government – federal, state/territory, and local.

Federally, the primary law enforcement agency is the Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has a wide mandate to enforce Australian criminal law and protect its national interests. There is also a number of other agencies that have powers confined to specific areas, such as customs and immigration (Australian Border Force), and white-collar crime (Australian Taxation Office, Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission). Each branch of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) has its own military police which operates under the Joint Military Police Unit (JMPU). The ADF Investigative Service also forms part of the JMPU and is the primary agency for complex investigations that fall under the &quot;Defence Force Discipline Act&quot;.

General law enforcement duties are generally the responsibility of state police forces, who are in turn responsible to a state government minister (usually a Minister for Police). These forces carry out uniformed policing throughout the entire state in which they operate. Other state government agencies may also have investigative or enforcement powers for specific offences within their purview, such as fisheries. The Northern Territory is the only Australian Territory with its own police force, but in Australia&#x27;s other territories (including the Australian Capital Territory) law enforcement is handled by the Federal Government, specifically the Australian Federal Police. Local governments may also employ their authorised officers, commonly known as council rangers, to enforce local government by-laws or certain state laws pertaining solely to the local government jurisdiction in which they&#x27;re employed. Council rangers do not have full police powers unless they are sworn as special constables.

State police officers and Australian Federal Police officers routinely carry firearms, other state and federal law enforcement officers may carry firearms or other items for personal defence depending on their agency or the condition in which they&#x27;re deployed. While on duty, an armed law enforcement officer&#x27;s duty belt generally consists of a handgun, Taser, expandable baton, pepper spray, a set of handcuffs, ammunition magazines, gloves, torch, and a two-way radio.

==Federal==
===Australian Federal Police===
The primary federal law enforcement agency in Australia is the Australian Federal Police. The AFP was created in 1979, having been the result of an amalgamation of the now-defunct Commonwealth Police and Australian Capital Territory Police Force. It is responsible for the investigation of federal offences (crimes against the Commonwealth), and has federal jurisdiction throughout Australia. It provides protective services to federal government properties, government personnel, dignitaries and foreign diplomatic officials, and major airports. It also provides regular law enforcement within external Australian territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. The boundaries between the two levels of law enforcement are somewhat flexible, and both state and federal police cooperate on or transfer cases between each other depending on the specific circumstances.

The AFP also conducts operations overseas. These include providing liaison officers to various overseas posts to assist in relations with various police forces overseas, providing community policing to assist in the development of foreign law enforcement agencies, and contributing to peacekeeping operations such as the RAMSI Mission in the Solomon Islands and the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.

The AFP forms part of Australia&#x27;s National Intelligence Community.

===Australian Border Force===

The Australian Border Force is responsible for customs and immigration enforcement and border protection at Australia&#x27;s ports as well as in Australian waters, and conducts investigations where the AFP does not have primary jurisdiction. Unlike AFP Officers, Border Force Officers do not have fully vested federal police powers, and can only exercise arrest and detain powers at airport and seaport jurisdictions. They may, however, detain persons for state or federal crimes or warrants until that person can be presented to a federal or state law enforcement officer with the appropriate powers. Australian Border Force officers have the authority to carry firearms when trained. In practice, only maritime, counter-terrorism, and investigation officers carry firearms.

===Australian Fisheries Management Authority===
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) provides fisheries enforcement in Australia&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone, officers are authorised under the &quot;Fisheries Management Act 1991&quot; to board and search vessels, and search vehicles and persons suspected of committing fisheries offences and may also search shore-based installation under a search warrant or in other specific circumstances. AFMA officers may with or without a warrant, arrest a person suspected of committing a fisheries offence or an offence against environmental law, and authorised to carry personal defense equipment. Like the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force, AFMA is overseen by the National Anti-Corruption Commission.

===Australian Tax Office===
The Australian Tax Office (ATO) is a revenue service responsible for tax collection throughout Australia. The ATO is overseen by the National Anti-Corruption Commission. ATO officers are provided limited law enforcement powers under the &quot;Excise Act 1901&quot; and the &quot;Tax Administration Act 1953.&quot; AFP and ABF officers are also provided powers under these Acts.

===Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission===
The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) is a standing commission to provide criminal intelligence to Federal and State law enforcement agencies and assists in criminal investigations. ACIC is formed under the &quot;Australian Crime Commission Act&quot;, and while the Commission itself does not have full law enforcement powers, law enforcement officers from state and federal agencies are routinely seconded to the ACIC to assist in its functions. Under the &quot;Australian Crime Commission Act&quot; ACIC members have a number of coercive powers to gather criminal intelligence. The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), is an independent criminology research institute formed under the ACIC, with the CEO of the ACIC also serving as the director of the ACI. Like the AFP, ACIC is also part of Australia&#x27;s National Intelligence Community.

===National Anti-Corruption Commission===
The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is a statutory anti-corruption commission responsible for investigating allegations of corrupt conduct by Commonwealth officials. The commission has the power to investigate Commonwealth ministers, public servants, statutory office holders, government agencies, parliamentarians, and personal staff of politicians and replaced the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The commission&#x27;s powers are equivalent to that of a Royal Commission with the ability to compel witnesses and compel documents to be produced to the commission.

==Military==

Military Police, also known as Service Police, are the law enforcement branches of the services of a military tasked with enforcing and investigating offences violating military law. 

In Australia, each branch of the Australian Defence Force maintains its independent police force made up of military personnel from that service. In the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police conducts general law enforcement duties including security on military installations, investigations and close personal protection. In the Royal Australian Navy, policing functions are undertaken by Coxswains. In the Royal Australian Air Force, security and law enforcement duties are undertaken by Security Forces and Airfield Defence personnel.

Along with the independent service police forces is the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS), a special ADF unit made up of Investigators from each service&#x27;s police and tasked with investigating more serious military offences. All ADF policing agencies come under the umbrella of the Joint Military Police Unit (JMPU), an agency of the Australian Department of Defence led by the Provost Marshal and tasked with providing specialised military policing services and supporting civilian police in defence matters.

==State/territory==

Each state, as well as the Northern Territory, is responsible for maintaining its police force which is responsible for policing at the state and local levels. This involves general law and order, forensics, traffic policing, major crime, anti-terrorism branches, water police, search and rescue and in some states transit police. Local policing in the Australian Capital Territory, Jervis Bay Territory and Australian external territories is contracted to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Each state has a Department of Corrections which looks after the jails and prisoners.

In some states, local governments employ by-laws officers or rangers to enforce local by-laws or ordinances relating to such matters as parking, dog ownership, retailing, littering, or water usage. These local government officers are not considered to be police forces as they generally only have the power to issue fines and do not have the same powers as state police. They may rely upon appointment as a special constable or legislated powers for their authority.
=== Police ===
State police also perform certain functions on behalf of the Australian government such as the enforcement of various Commonwealth Acts and regulations in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and other Commonwealth officers.

The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Jervis Bay Territory are serviced by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) ACT Policing. The AFP also provide local policing the Australian external territories. 

While ACT Policing is under the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police, the following policing agencies are regulated by their respective state or territory government and are highly visible:

===Sheriffs===
In recent years, the states and territories have returned the responsibility of recovering court-ordered fines to their sheriffs. In practice, the police often carry out the functions of sheriffs and bailiffs in rural and more sparsely populated areas of Australia.

The office of sheriff was first established in Australia in 1824. This was simultaneous with the appointment of the first Chief Justice of New South Wales. The role of the sheriff has not been static, nor is it identical in each Australian state. In the past, a sheriff&#x27;s duties included: executing court judgments, acting as a coroner, transporting prisoners, managing the jails, and carrying out executions (through the employment of an anonymous hangman).

Currently, no Australian state provides for capital punishment. A government department (usually called the Department of Corrections or similar) now runs the prison system and the coroner&#x27;s office handles coronal matters. In most states, the sheriff is now largely responsible for enforcing the civil orders and fines of the court by seizing and selling the property of judgment debtors who do not satisfy the debt, providing court security, enforcing arrest warrants, evictions, taking juveniles into custody, and running the jury system. In some states the duties of the Sheriff also extends to courtroom security. Some state sheriffs can also apply a wide range of sanctions ranging from suspending driver&#x27;s licenses and car registration through to wheel clamping and arranging community service orders, and as a last resort can make arrests.

===Fisheries===
In addition to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, each state and the Northern Territory have Fisheries officers authorised to enforce State and Federal fisheries laws within their state&#x27;s jurisdiction. The powers of these fisheries officers vary from State to State but generally, these officers have the power to board vessels, search vehicles, vessels, and persons and conduct arrests all in relation to fisheries laws. In some States, such as New South Wales, fisheries officers are authorised to carry personal defense equipment like their Federal counterparts.

===Local===
Council rangers are officers employed by local government areas in Australia to enforce the by-laws (local laws in Western Australia); of those local governments and a limited range of state laws relating to such matters as litter control, animal control, dog and cat laws, fire control, off-road vehicles, emergency management, and parking. Unless they are also sworn in as special constables rangers do not have full police powers. Council rangers are also referred to as local laws officers in some of Australia&#x27;s eastern states. Most Council rangers have the power to issue fines that do not exceed a certain amount.

==Advisory bodies and community groups==
The Australia New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA) was established in October 2007. ANZPAA is a joint initiative of the Australian and New Zealand Police Commissioners and is funded by contributions to Australia and New Zealand Police jurisdictions. ANZPAA is a non-operational policing agency that provides strategy and policy advice, and secretarial services to the ANZPAA Board on cross-jurisdictional policing initiatives that help enhance community safety and security. ANZPAA&#x27;s strategic direction is set by ANZPAA’s board and the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation (ANZCoPP, formerly Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee, APPSC).

The Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee (APPSC) was an organisation that served all police jurisdictions around Australia and New Zealand. It was the body for police education and training in Australia and New Zealand; the council comprising each of the police commissioners from Australia and New Zealand along with the president of the Police Federation of Australia and the president of the New Zealand Police Association. On 9 November 2007, APPSC roles and functions were amalgamated into ANZPAA. In 2013, APPSC was retitled to the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation.

Crime Stoppers programs run in each state and on a national level. These programs collect information about crimes and pass them on to police, ensuring that the community can participate in fighting crime.

== Controversies ==
=== Colonial legacy ===
Involvement of state law enforcement in suppressing Indigenous resistance to colonisation has been widely controversial. The New South Wales Mounted Police were formed following the Bathurst War between British colonists and the Wiradjuri people in 1824, and in modern Australia continue to be deployed as part of police presence at peaceful protests in many states.

Across colonial Australia, police forces were mobilised in violent conflict during the Australian frontier wars and were heavily involved in the many Indigenous fatalities that led to sharp decline of Indigenous populations since colonisation. The Queensland Native Police Force alone were responsible for an estimated 24,000 &quot;violent Aboriginal deaths&quot; between 1859 and 1897, as calculated by professor Raymond Evans in 2009.

Slavery in Australia was sanctioned by law (before being banned in 1901 following Federation) and was officially upheld by many police forces and government systems. In the Northern Territory, the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (Cth) allowed forced recruitment of Indigenous people and legal non-payment of wages, granting Protectors and police the right to uphold this arrangement.

=== Police misconduct and corruption ===
==Transportation==
By agreement between the various commissioners, most police cars in Australia are predominantly white, with a blue and white Sillitoe tartan checkered strip on the side. Historically, police fleets were composed predominantly of domestically built models such as the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon. With the demise of Holden and Ford production in Australia, fleets have grown to include models such as the Chrysler 300, BMW 5 Series, Kia Stinger, Volkswagen Passat, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and Hyundai Sonata. Prisoner transport vehicles are based on light commercial vehicles such as the Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, Holden Colorado, Mercedes Vito, or Volkswagen Transporter.

A wide range of vehicles are used for unmarked purposes to blend in with civilian vehicles.

Emergency vehicle lighting differs across Australian jurisdictions and may vary based on law enforcement functions (e.g. parks compliance, fisheries, local law enforcement, etc.). However, primary law enforcement agencies utilise blue and red flashing warning lights.

Most Australian police services have mounted police units that are prominently used for ceremonial purposes, although in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria the mounted police also undertake operational policing duties.

<doc id="1120210" wikidata="Q1259422" url="?curid=1120210" title="Asteridae">
<text>Asteridae is an obsolete botanical name at the rank of subclass. Composition of the subclass has also varied; however, by definition it always includes the family Asteraceae (Compositae). In the modern APG IV system of classification, asterid and euasterid are names for clades with a composition similar to that of Asteridae.

One of the better-known and more influential systems that formally recognized subclass Asteridae was the Cronquist system devised by botanist Arthur Cronquist, which included the orders:

* Gentianales
* Solanales
* Lamiales
* Callitrichales
* Plantaginales
* Scrophulariales
* Campanulales
* Rubiales
* Dipsacales
* Calycerales
* Asterales

Most of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have definitely been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies.

To a large extent Cronquist&#x27;s subclass Asteridae corresponds with the older concepts of Sympetalae and Tubiflorae, groups that were defined by having their petals united into a tube. However, these older classifications contained some sympetalous families, such as Cucurbitaceae, that are now known not to be closely related. Cronquist&#x27;s concept also corresponds closely with the APG II group of euasterids but the APG does not formally recognize a group called &quot;Asteridae&quot; (or any other group above the rank of order).

Recent phylogenetic studies have suggested that several families, including three major orders not included in Asteridae by Cronquist, Ericales, Cornales, and Apiales, also belong to the asterid group. The circumscription of subclass Asteridae, as well as the circumscriptions of the orders contained within it, is currently in a state of flux; many systematic botanists refer to these as clades (asterids, euasterids, etc.), rather than use formal names such as subclass Asteridae.

<doc id="1120214" wikidata="Q289971" url="?curid=1120214" title="Cloop">
<text>The compressed loop device (cloop) is a module for the Linux kernel. It adds support for transparently decompressed, read-only block devices. It is not a compressed file system: cloop is mostly used as a convenient way to compress conventional file systems onto Live CDs.

Cloop was originally written for the Levanta Bootable Business Card by Rusty Russell, but is now maintained by Klaus Knopper, the author of Knoppix. 

A compression ratio of about 2.5:1 is common for software. The Knoppix cloop image, for example, is 700 MB compressed and around 1.8 GB uncompressed.

== Design ==
cloop images contain:

* A shell script (with mount commands for the image)
* A header with the number of blocks and the uncompressed block size
* A seek index with compressed and uncompressed block sizes in pairs
* zlib-compressed data blocks, packed end-to-end

The data blocks are compressed separately; this makes it possible to seek to individual blocks without having to decompress the entire image from the start, but at the cost of slightly reducing the compression ratio. Live CD images typically use a block size of 256 KB as a compromise between decompression speed and space-efficiency.

Apple uses a similar file format in the compressed variant of its DMG disk images.

== Limitations ==
The design of the cloop driver requires that compressed blocks be read whole from disk. This makes cloop access inherently slower when there are many scattered reads, which can happen if the system is low on memory or when a large program with many shared libraries is starting. A big issue is the seek time for CD-ROM drives (~80 ms), which exceeds that of hard disks (~10 ms) by a large factor. On the other hand, because files are packed together, reading a compressed block may thus bring in more than one file into the cache. The effects of tail packing are known to improve seek times (cf. reiserfs, btrfs), especially for small files. Some performance tests related to cloop have been conducted.

<doc id="1120226" wikidata="Q701321" url="?curid=1120226" title="Japanese war crimes">
<text>During its imperial era, the Empire of Japan committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity across various Asian-Pacific nations, notably during the Second Sino-Japanese and Pacific Wars. These incidents have been referred to as &quot;the Asian Holocaust&quot;, and &quot;Japan&#x27;s Holocaust&quot;, and also as the &quot;Rape of Asia&quot;. The crimes occurred during the early part of the Shōwa era, under Hirohito&#x27;s reign.

The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) were responsible for a multitude of war crimes leading to millions of deaths. War crimes ranged from sexual slavery and massacres to human experimentation, torture, starvation, and forced labor, all either directly committed or condoned by the Japanese military and government. Evidence of these crimes, including oral testimonies and written records such as diaries and war journals, has been provided by Japanese veterans.

The Japanese political and military leadership knew of its military&#x27;s crimes, yet continued to allow it and even support it, with the majority of Japanese troops stationed in Asia either taking part in or supporting the killings.

The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service participated in chemical and biological attacks on civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, violating international agreements that Japan had previously signed, including the Hague Conventions, which prohibited the use of &quot;poison or poisoned weapons&quot; in warfare.

Since the 1950s, numerous apologies for the war crimes have been issued by senior Japanese government officials; however, apologies issued by Japanese officials have been criticized by some as insincere. Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged the country&#x27;s role in causing &quot;tremendous damage and suffering&quot; before and during World War II, particularly the massacre and rape of civilians in Nanjing by the IJA. However, the issue remains controversial, with some members of the Japanese government, including former prime ministers Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzō Abe, having paid respects at the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors all Japanese war dead, including convicted Class A war criminals. Furthermore, some Japanese history textbooks provide only brief references to the war crimes, and certain members of the Liberal Democratic Party have denied some of the atrocities, such as the government&#x27;s involvement in abducting women to serve as &quot;comfort women&quot;, a euphemism for sex slaves.

==Definitions==

The Tokyo Charter defines war crimes as &quot;violations of the laws or customs of war,&quot; which involves acts using prohibited weapons, violating battlefield norms while engaging in combat with the enemy combatants, or against protected persons, including enemy civilians and citizens and property of neutral states as in the case of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Military personnel from the Empire of Japan have been convicted of committing many such acts during the period of Japanese imperialism from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. Japanese military soldiers conducted a series of human rights abuses against civilians and prisoners of war throughout East Asia and the western Pacific region. These events reached their height during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937–45 and the Asian and Pacific campaigns of World War II (1941–45).

===International and Japanese law===

Japan signed the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War and the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded, but the Japanese government declined to ratify the POW Convention. In 1942, the Japanese government stated that it would abide by the terms of the Convention &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; (&#x27;changing what has to be changed&#x27;). The crimes committed also fall under other aspects of international and Japanese law. For example, many of the crimes committed by Japanese personnel during World War II broke Japanese military law, and were subject to court martial, as required by that law. The Empire also violated international agreements signed by Japan, including provisions of the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) such as protections for prisoners of war and a ban on the use of chemical weapons, the 1930 Forced Labour Convention which prohibited forced labor, the 1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children which prohibited human trafficking, and other agreements. The Japanese government also signed the Kellogg–Briand Pact (1929), thereby rendering its actions in 1937–45 liable to charges of crimes against peace, a charge that was introduced at the Tokyo Trials to prosecute &quot;Class A&quot; war criminals. &quot;Class B&quot; war criminals were those found guilty of war crimes &quot;per se&quot;, and &quot;Class C&quot; war criminals were those guilty of crimes against humanity. The Japanese government also accepted the terms set by the Potsdam Declaration (1945) after the end of the war, including the provision in Article 10 of punishment for &quot;all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners&quot;. Japanese law does not define those convicted in the post-1945 trials as criminals, despite the fact that Japan&#x27;s governments have accepted the judgments made in the trials, and in the Treaty of San Francisco (1952). Former Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had advocated the position that Japan accepted the Tokyo tribunal and its judgements as a condition for ending the war, but that its verdicts have no relation to domestic law. According to Abe, those convicted of war crimes are not criminals under Japanese law.

===Historical and geographical extent===

Outside Japan, different societies use widely different timeframes when they define Japanese war crimes. For example, the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 was enforced by the Japanese military, and the Society of Yi Dynasty Korea was switched to the political system of the Empire of Japan. Thus, North and South Korea both refer to &quot;Japanese war crimes&quot; as events which occurred during the period of Korea under Japanese rule.

By comparison, the Western Allies did not come into a military conflict with Japan until 1941, and North Americans, Australians, South East Asians and Europeans may consider &quot;Japanese war crimes&quot; to be events that occurred from 1942 to 1945.

Japanese war crimes were not always carried out by ethnic Japanese personnel. A small minority of people in every Asian and Pacific country invaded or occupied by Japan collaborated with the Japanese military, or even served in it, for a wide variety of reasons, such as economic hardship, coercion, or antipathy to other imperialist powers. In addition to Japanese civil and military personnel, Chinese (including Manchus), Koreans, and Taiwanese who were forced to serve in the military of the Empire of Japan were also found to have committed war crimes as part of the Japanese Imperial Army.

Both South Korea and North Korea have stated that the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which lead to the annexation of Korea by Japan, was concluded illegally.

==Background==

===Japanese militarism, nationalism, imperialism, and racism===


Militarism, nationalism, and racism, especially during Japan&#x27;s imperialist expansion, had great bearings on the conduct of the Japanese armed forces both before and during the Second World War. After the Meiji Restoration and the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Emperor became the focus of military loyalty, nationalism, and racism. During the so-called &quot;Age of Imperialism&quot; in the late 19th century, Japan followed the lead of other world powers by establishing a colonial empire, an objective which it aggressively pursued.

Unlike many other major powers, Japan never ratified the Geneva Convention of 1929—also known as the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva 27 July 1929—which was the version of the Geneva Convention that covered the treatment of prisoners of war during World War II. Nevertheless, Japan ratified the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 which contained provisions regarding prisoners of war and an Imperial Proclamation in 1894 stated that Japanese soldiers should make every effort to win the war without violating international laws. According to Japanese historian Yuki Tanaka, Japanese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War released 1,790 Chinese prisoners without harm, once they signed an agreement not to take up arms against Japan if they were released. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, all of the 79,367 Russian prisoners who were held by the Japanese were released and they were also paid for the labor which they performed for the Japanese, in accordance with the Hague Convention. Similarly, the behavior of the Japanese military in World War I was at least as humane as that of other militaries which fought during the war, with some German prisoners of the Japanese finding life in Japan so agreeable that they stayed and settled in Japan after the war.
Propaganda depictions of the Japanese military as superior and of others such as the Chinese or Koreans as cowards, pigs, rats, or mice occurred in the use of woodcuts produced for wide consumption which were intended to provide a cruel amusement. The Myrdal-Kessle woodcut cartoon collection donated to the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, Sweden, was the subject of a catalogued exhibition in 2011 and includes examples of this type of material from the Meiji period.

===Events of the 1930s and 1940s===
By the late 1930s, the rise of militarism in Japan created at least superficial similarities between the wider Japanese military culture and that of Germany. Japan also had a military secret police force within the IJA, known as the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, which resembled the Nazi &quot;Gestapo&quot; in its role in annexed and occupied countries, but which had existed for nearly a decade before Hitler&#x27;s own birth.

Perceived failure or insufficient devotion to the Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind. In the military, officers would assault and beat men under their command, who would pass the beating all the way down on to the lowest ranks. In POW camps, this meant that prisoners of war received the worst beatings of all, partly in the belief that such punishments were merely the proper technique to deal with disobedience.

The phenomenon of &quot;gekokujō&quot; (下克上) which involves lower-ranking officers overthrowing or assassinating their superiors, as evidenced by the multiple coups and assassinations carried out on the mainland, also allowed for the proliferation of war crimes because if commanders tried to restrict atrocities they would either face mutiny or reassignment. Historians have also attributed war crimes to the lack of supervision and disorganization within the military which without stronger control over units and effective court martial procedures allowed for war crimes to go unpunished and therefore continue.

==War crimes==

Much of the controversy regarding Japan&#x27;s role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian Sterling Seagrave has written that:
In 1943, Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito and a member of the Imperial House of Japan, served as an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army stationed in China. He authored a book published in 1984, in which he revealed his shock at the atrocities carried out by the Japanese military during his one-year deployment in China. In 1994, the Japanese newspaper outlet Yomiuri Shimbun conducted an interview with him. He provided an account of Japanese atrocities committed against the Chinese, and verified that he had denounced the aggression in a speech addressed to Japanese soldiers in China during World War II. He discovered that military officers utilized Chinese prisoners of war for bayonet drills to bolster the resolve of Japanese soldiers. Additionally, he noted that POWs were asphyxiated and shot in large numbers while being restrained to posts. He emphasized that killing POWs in a gruesome manner constitutes a massacre, affirming without doubt that Japanese soldiers indeed committed such atrocious acts.

According to Werner Gruhl, approximately eight million Chinese civilian deaths were attributable directly to Japanese aggression.

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among prisoners of war from Asian countries held by Japan was 27.1%. The death rate of Chinese prisoners of war were much higher because—under a directive ratified on 5 August 1937, by Emperor Hirohito—the constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed. Only 56 Chinese prisoners of war were released after the surrender of Japan. After 20 March 1943, officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered and encouraged the Navy to execute all prisoners taken at sea.

According to British historian Mark Felton, &quot;officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the deliberately sadistic murders of more than 20,000 Allied seamen and countless civilians in cold-blooded defiance of the Geneva Convention.&quot; At least 12,500 British sailors and 7,500 Australians were murdered. The Japanese Navy sank Allied merchant and Red Cross vessels, then murdered the survivors floating in the sea or in lifeboats. During Naval landing parties, the Japanese Navy rounded up, raped, then massacred civilians. Some of the victims were fed to sharks, others were killed by sledge-hammer, bayonet, crucifixion, drowning, hanging, and beheading.

===Attacks on neutral powers===

Article 1 of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;III – The Opening of Hostilities&quot; prohibited the initiation of hostilities against neutral powers &quot;without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war&quot; and Article 2 further stated that &quot;[t]he existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph.&quot; Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred on 7 December 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over. Tokyo transmitted the 5,000-word notification (commonly called the &quot;14-Part Message&quot;) in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time.

The 14-Part Message was not moreover a declaration of war, but was instead about sending a message to U.S. officials that peace negotiations between Japan and the U.S. were likely to be terminated. Japanese officials were well aware that the 14-Part Message was not a proper declaration of war as required by the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;III – The Opening of Hostilities&quot;. They decided not to issue a proper declaration of war anyway as they feared that doing so would expose their secret attack on Pearl Harbor to the Americans.

Some historical negationists and conspiracy theorists charge that President Franklin D. Roosevelt willingly allowed the attack to happen to create a pretext for war, but no credible evidence exists to support the claim. The diary of Henry L. Stimson, Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of War, showed that Roosevelt believed in late November 1941 that a Japanese attack on British or Dutch soil was &quot;likely,&quot; but was &quot;confident that the Japanese would not dare to start hostilities against the United States.&quot; The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan declared war on the U.S. and the U.S. likewise declared war on Japan.

Simultaneously with the bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (Honolulu time), Japan invaded the British colony of Malaya, bombed Singapore, and began land actions in Hong Kong, without a declaration of war or an ultimatum. Both the United States and United Kingdom were neutral when Japan attacked their territories without explicit warning of a state of war.

The U.S. officially classified all 3,649 military and civilian casualties and destruction of military property at Pearl Harbor as non-combatants as there was no state of war between the U.S. and Japan when the attack occurred. Joseph B. Keenan, the chief prosecutor in the Tokyo Trials, says that the attack on Pearl Harbor not only happened without a declaration of war but was also a &quot;treacherous and deceitful act&quot;. In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials distracted up to the point that Japanese planes launched their attack on Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack; as it turned out, he was killed by the USAAF in Operation Vengeance in 1943. At the Tokyo Trials, Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, Shigenori Tōgō, then Foreign Minister, Shigetarō Shimada, the Minister of the Navy, and Osami Nagano, Chief of Naval General Staff, were charged with crimes against peace (charges 1 to 36) and murder (charges 37 to 52) in connection with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Along with war crimes and crimes against humanity (charges 53 to 55), Tojo was among the seven Japanese leaders sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1948, Shigenori Tōgō received a 20-year sentence, Shimada received a life sentence, and Nagano died of natural causes during the Trial in 1947.

Over the years, many Japanese nationalists argued that the attack on Pearl Harbor was justified as an act of self-defense in response to the oil embargo imposed by the United States. Most historians and scholars agree that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception of something being essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan had failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat Takeo Iguchi states that it is &quot;[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.&quot; While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a halt by the American embargo, this &quot;need&quot; cannot be considered proportional with the destruction suffered by the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as devastating as possible.

===Mass killings===

The estimated number of people killed by Japanese troops varies. R. J. Rummel, a professor of political science at the University of Hawaii, estimates that between 1937 and 1945, the Japanese military murdered from nearly three to over ten million people, most likely six million Chinese, Indians, Koreans, Malays, Indonesians, Filipinos, and Indochinese, among others, including European, American, and Australian prisoners of war. According to Rummel, &quot;This democide [i.e., death by government] was due to a morally bankrupt political and military strategy, military expediency and custom, and national culture.&quot; According to Rummel, in China alone, from 1937 to 1945, approximately 3.9 million Chinese were killed, mostly civilians, as a direct result of the Japanese operations and a total of 10.2 million Chinese were killed in the course of the war. According to the British historian M. R. D. Foot, civilian deaths were between 10 million and 20 million. British historian Mark Felton claims that up to 30 million people were killed, most of them civilians.:

One of the major atrocities committed during this period was the Nanjing Massacre of 1937–38, when, according to the findings of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the Japanese Army massacred as many as 260,000 civilians and prisoners of war, though some have placed the figure as high as 350,000. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders has the death figure of 300,000 inscribed on its entrance. 

In the early 1980s, after conducting extensive interviews with Chinese survivors and reviewing existing Japanese records, Japanese journalist Honda Katsuichi concluded that the violence perpetrated by Japanese troops in the Nanjing Massacre was not an isolated event. Instead, it was part of a broader pattern of Japanese atrocities against the Chinese in the Lower Yangtze region since the Battle of Shanghai. Hosaka Akira was an army physician, and his infantry battalion was stationed in China. In his diary, he admitted to following an order to murder civilians in the Chinese city of Changzhou. 
Hosaka&#x27;s diary documenting the Japanese atrocities in Changzhou has been supported by various Japanese sources. In 1987, his squad leader, Kitayama, confessed to killing civilians in Changzhou. Makihara Nobuo was part of a infantry platoon that entered a Chinese town. In Makihara&#x27;s diary, he recorded that his Machine Gun Company followed orders to indiscriminately kill all civilians in the town.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese followed what has been called a &quot;killing policy&quot;, including killings committed against minorities such as Hui Muslims in China. According to Wan Lei, &quot;In a Hui clustered village in Gaocheng county of Hebei, the Japanese captured twenty Hui men among whom they only set two younger men free through &quot;redemption&quot;, and buried alive the other eighteen Hui men. In Mengcun village of Hebei, the Japanese killed more than 1,300 Hui people within three years of their occupation of that area.&quot; The Japanese also desecrated and destroyed mosques, and destroyed Hui cemeteries. After the Nanjing Massacre, mosques in Nanjing were found filled with dead bodies. Many Hui Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese War fought against the Japanese military.

In addition, The Hui Muslim county of Dachang was subjected to massacres by the Japanese military.

Another massacre during this period was the Parit Sulong massacre in Japanese-occupied Malaya, when, according to the findings of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the Imperial Japanese Army massacred approximately five hundred prisoners of war, although higher estimates exist. A similar crime committed was the Changjiao massacre in China. Back in Southeast Asia, the Laha massacre resulted in the deaths of prisoners of war on Japanese-occupied Indonesia&#x27;s Ambon Island, and in Japanese-occupied Singapore&#x27;s Alexandra Hospital massacre, Japanese soldiers murdered hundreds of wounded Allied soldiers, innocent citizens, and medical staff. 

In Southeast Asia, the Manila massacre of February 1945 resulted in the death of 100,000 civilians in the Japanese-occupied Philippines. It is estimated that at least one out of every 20 Filipinos died at the hands of the Japanese during the occupation. In Singapore during February and March 1942, the Sook Ching massacre was a systematic extermination of &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; elements among the Chinese population; however, Japanese soldiers did not try to identify who was &quot;anti-Japanese&quot;. As a result, the Japanese soldiers engaged in indiscriminate killing. Former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, who was almost a victim of the Sook Ching Massacre, has stated that there were between 50,000 and 90,000 casualties. According to Lieutenant Colonel Hishakari Takafumi, a newspaper correspondent at the time, the plan was to ultimately kill about 50,000 Chinese, and 25,000 had already been murdered when the order was received to scale down the operation.

There were other massacres of civilians, such as the Kalagon massacre. In wartime Southeast Asia, the Overseas Chinese and European diaspora were particular targets of Japanese abuse; in the former case, this was motivated by a Sinophobic resentment of the historic expanse and influence of Chinese culture, and in the latter, by a racist Pan-Asianism and a desire to show former colonial subjects the impotence of their former rulers. The Japanese executed all the Malay Sultans on Kalimantan and wiped out the Malay elite in the Pontianak incidents. In the Jesselton Revolt, the Japanese killed thousands of native civilians during the Japanese occupation of British Borneo and nearly wiped out the entire Suluk Muslim population of the coastal islands. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, when a Moro Muslim juramentado swordsman launched a suicide attack against the Japanese, the Japanese would massacre the man&#x27;s entire family or village. However, Chinese immigrants in Southeast Asia were sometimes spared if they supported the war effort, whether sincerely or not. This also applied to other ethnicities.

50 Moros were vivisected by a Japanese unit, the 33rd coast guard squad in Zamboanga in Mindanao in which Akira Makino served in. Moro guerillas armed with spears were the main enemies of the Japanese in the area.

Historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta reports that a &quot;Three Alls Policy&quot; () was implemented in China from 1942 to 1945 and was in itself responsible for the deaths of &quot;more than 2.7 million&quot; Chinese civilians. This scorched earth strategy, sanctioned by Hirohito himself, directed Japanese forces to &quot;kill all, burn all, and loot all&quot;, which caused many massacres such as the Panjiayu massacre, where 1,230 Chinese people were killed. Additionally, captured Allied servicemen, and civilians were massacred in various incidents, including the following:
* Alexandra Hospital massacre
* Laha massacre
* Bangka Island massacre
* Parit Sulong Massacre
* Palawan massacre
* SS &quot;Behar&quot;
* massacre perpetrated by 
* Wake Island massacre
* Tinta Massacre
* Bataan Death March
* Sandakan Death Marches
* &quot;Shin&#x27;yō Maru&quot; Incident
* Sulug Island massacre
* Pontianak incidents
* Manila massacre (concurrent with the Battle of Manila)
* Balikpapan massacre
* Dutch East Indies massacres
The Japanese massacred Hui Muslims in their mosques in Nanjing and destroyed Hui mosques in other parts of China. Shen Xi&#x27;en and his father Shen Decheng witnessed the corpses of Hui Muslims slaughtered by the Japanese in Nanjing, when he was asked by Hui people to help bury their relatives. The Hui security maintenance leader Sun Shurong and Hui Imams Zhang Zihui, Ma Zihe, Ge Changfa, Wang Shouren, Ma Changfa were involved in collecting Hui corpses and burying them after the Nanjing massacre. The Ji&#x27;e lane Mosque caretaker father Zhang was in his 60s when killed by the Japanese and his decomposing corpse was the first to be washed in accordance to Islamic custom and buried. They buried the Hui corpses in Jiuhua mountain, Dongguashi, Hongtu Bridge (where Guangzhou road is now located), Wutai mountain, Donguashi (where Nanjing Normal University is located). Shen Xi&#x27;en helped bury 400 Hui bodies including children, women, and men. Shen recalled burying a 7 or 8 year old boy in addition to his mother among the Hui bodies.

Japanese used machine guns to massacre Muslim Suluk children and women at a mosque in the aftermath of the Jesselton revolt.

In the Pontianak incidents, the Japanese justified their mass execution of the twelve Arab and Malay Muslim Sultans by claiming they were planning to rebel and that the Arabs, Sultans, and Chinese were all working to &quot;massacre Japanese&quot;. The Japanese report on the incident noted that there were anti-Dutch Chinese independence movements before and linked them to the anti-Japanese conspiracy. On 28 June 1944 the Japanese executed the Sultans of West Kalimantan including Pontianak after a naval court martial. The accusations against the Sultans were printed in Borneo Shimbun on 1 July 1944. The Japanese slaughter of the Malay sultans of west Kalimantan led to Dayaks ascending to the political scene after the violent destruction of the Malay nobility at the hands of Japan.

===Human experimentation and biological warfare===

Special Japanese military units conducted experiments on civilians and POWs in China. The purpose of experimentation was to develop biological weapons that could be used for aggression. Biological agents and gases developed from these experiments were used against the Chinese Army and civilian population. These included Unit 731 under Shirō Ishii. Victims were subjected to experiments including but not limited to vivisection, amputations without anesthesia, testing of biological weapons, horse blood transfusions, and injection of animal blood into their corpses. Anesthesia was not used because it was believed that anesthetics would adversely affect the results of the experiments.

A former unit 731 member testified:

As soon as the symptoms were observed, the prisoner was taken from the cell and into the dissection room...he was strapped down, still screaming frightfully. One of the doctors stuffed a towel into his mouth, then with one quick slice of the scalpel he was opened up.&quot; Witnesses at vivisections report that the victim usually lets out a horrible scream when the cut is made, and the voice stops soon after.
Furthermore, according to the 2002 &quot;International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare&quot;, the number of people killed by the Imperial Japanese Army germ warfare and human experiments is around 580,000. Top officers of Unit 731 were not prosecuted for war crimes after the war, in exchange for turning over the results of their research to the Allies. They were also reportedly given responsible positions in Japan&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry, medical schools, and health ministry.

While Unit 731 is the most infamous facility, scholars have shown that Japanese biological and chemical warfare units stationed in Beijing (Unit 1855), Nanjing (Unit 1644) and Canton (Unit 1688) also experimented on human subjects.
One case of human experimentation occurred in Japan itself. At least nine of 11 members of Lt.Marvin Watkins&#x27; 29th Bomb Group crew (of the 6th Bomb Squadron) survived the crash of their U.S. Army Air Forces B-29 bomber on Kyūshū, on 5 May 1945. The bomber&#x27;s commander was separated from his crew and sent to Tokyo for interrogation, while the other survivors were taken to the anatomy department of Kyushu University, at Fukuoka, where they were subjected to vivisection or killed.

In 1939, Unit 731 launched 100 periodic biological attacks on military and civilian targets. Attacks include contaminating wells with intestinal pathogens, distribution of microbe-laced foods, air drops of plague inflected fleas, and aerial spray of contaminants. Although the effectiveness of the biological attacks is hard to assess, civilian casualties are estimated to be high, with several hundred thousand killed.

Some Japanese physicians killed their victims with potassium cyanide before dissecting them, while others used chloroform. Yoshio Onodera, who conducted human experiments within Unit 1644, testified that his group conducted experiments on roughly 100-150 people. They would then murder their victims by injecting them with chloroform.

On 11 March 1948, 30 people, including several doctors and one female nurse, were brought to trial by American military tribunal. Fukujiro Ishiyama, the doctor most responsible for the experimentation, killed himself before the trial started. Charges of cannibalism were dropped, but 23 people were found guilty of vivisection or wrongful removal of body parts. Five were sentenced to death, four to life imprisonment, and the rest to shorter terms. In 1950, the military governor of Japan, General Douglas MacArthur, commuted all of the death sentences and significantly reduced most of the prison terms. All of those involved in relation to the university vivisection, with the exception of Isamu Yokoyama, the general most responsible for allowing the experimentation to happen, walked free no later than 1958. Yokoyama died in prison in 1952. In 1980, an author found that one of the doctors who was supposed to be executed was still alive and practicing medicine.

In China, the Japanese waged ruthless biological warfare against Chinese civilians and soldiers. Japanese aviators sprayed fleas carrying plague germs over metropolitan areas, creating bubonic plague epidemics. Japanese soldiers used flasks of diseases-causing microbes, which included cholera, dysentery, typhoid, anthrax, and paratyphoid, to contaminate rivers, wells, reservoirs, and houses; mixed food with deadly bacteria to infect hungry Chinese civilians; and even passed out chocolate filled with anthrax bacteria to the local children.

During the final months of World War II, Japan had planned to use plague as a biological weapon against U.S. civilians in San Diego, California, during Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night, hoping that the plague would spread terror to the American population, and thereby dissuade America from attacking Japan. The plan was set to launch at night on 22 September 1945, but Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.

In July 1989, a mass grave of more than one hundred skeletons was unearthed at a construction site in Tokyo, which was the former location of the Army Medical College from 1929 to 1945. Investigators determined that the bones belonged to various ethnic Asian groups of foreign origin, as indicated by the skulls. Investigators also discovered skulls that were marked with scalpels, cut by a sword, or pierced by bullets from a pistol. From these findings, it&#x27;s inferred that Japanese military physicians conducted experiments on the brains of individuals on the battlefield, and that the evidence was subsequently disposed of and buried at that location.

In 2006, former IJN medical officer Akira Makino stated that he was ordered—as part of his training—to carry out vivisection on about 30 civilian prisoners in the Philippines between December 1944 and February 1945. The surgery included amputations. Most of Makino&#x27;s victims were Moro Muslims. Ken Yuasa, a former military doctor in China, has also admitted to similar incidents in which he was aggressively performing live vivisections on live Chinese victims, blaming the nationalistic indoctrination of his schooling for his conduct and lack of remorse. Yuasa admitted to killing Chinese captives while training others in surgery. He further added that in order to quickly train military physicians for the battlefield, physicians would gather every few months to perform &quot;surgery drills&quot; in China. Surgery drills involved capturing local citizens, shooting them in the thigh with a bullet, and monitoring the amount of time it would take to extract the bullet. The drills were widespread in China, with most instances involving the abduction of local citizens by the military and their subsequent delivery to the Army&#x27;s medical division.

The Imperial House of Japan was responsible for the human experimentation programs, as members of the imperial family, including Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, Prince Chichibu, Prince Mikasa, and Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda, participated in the programs in various ways, which included authorizing, funding, supplying, and inspecting biomedical facilities.

Shiro Ishii was demoted after the cholera attack he directed in 1942 against Chinese civilians accidentally infected and killed Japanese soldiers and he did not direct anymore bioglocial attacks for the rest of the war. Ishii boasted about his role in the 1940-1941 biological disease attacks and boasted to the Japanese army in the 1942 attacks that he would kill even more, until he accidentally killed Japanese troops with his own weapons, causing a disaster among Japanese ranks and he was forced out and replaced.

===Use of chemical weapons===
While obtaining precise numbers is difficult, recent studies indicate that the number of Chinese killed by Japanese chemical warfare may have been in excess of 500,000 people.

Throughout the war with China from 1937 to 1945, Japan deployed chemical weapons, including poisonous and irritating gases, against both Chinese military personnel and civilians. This action was denounced by the League of Nations in May 1938.

According to Walter E. Grunden, history professor at Bowling Green State University, the Japanese incorporated gas warfare into many aspects of their army&#x27;s war against China because they concluded that Chinese forces were unable to retaliate in kind. Their utilization of gas warfare involved deploying specialized gas troops, as well as infantry, artillery, engineers, and air force units. Grunden further added that &quot;from 1937 to 1945, the military services of Japan used chemical weapons on over 2000 occasions, primarily in the China Theater of Operations.&quot; 

The Narashino Military Academy near Tokyo had assembled a compilation of fifty-six case studies detailing the use of chemical weapons by Japan in China during World War II. This collection included information on lethal agents like Yperite, commonly known as mustard gas. The document was discovered at the National Archives and Records Administration by a Japanese historian.

According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Kentaro Awaya, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, gas weapons, such as tear gas, were sporadically used in 1937, but in early 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army resorted to the full-scale use of phosgene, chlorine, Lewisite, and nausea gas (red), and from mid-1939, mustard gas (yellow) was used against both Kuomintang and Communist Chinese troops.

In 2004, Yoshimi and Yuki Tanaka discovered documents in the Australian National Archives which state that cyanide gas was tested on Australian and Dutch prisoners in November 1944 on Kai Islands (Indonesia).

According to Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, Emperor Hirohito signed orders which specified the use of chemical weapons in China. For example, during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions, despite the 1899 Hague Declaration &quot;IV, 2 – Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases&quot; and Article 23 (a) of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot;. A resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemned the use of poison gas by Japan.

According to Prince Mikasa, a member of the imperial family of Japan, he watched an army film that showed Japanese troops gassing Chinese prisoners who were tied to stakes.

Another incident of chemical warfare occurred during the Battle of Yichang in October 1941, during which the 19th Artillery Regiment helped the 13th Brigade of the IJA 11th Army by launching 1,000 yellow gas shells and 1,500 red gas shells at the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. The area was crowded with Chinese civilians unable to evacuate. Some 3,000 Chinese soldiers were in the area and 1,600 were affected. The Japanese report stated that &quot;the effect of gas seems considerable&quot;.

In 2004, Yoshimi Yoshiaki published the most comprehensive study of Japan&#x27;s military use of poisonous gases in China and Southeast Asia. Yoshimi discovered a battle report by a Japanese Infantry Brigade that detailed its use of mustard gas in a major operation against the Communist-led Eighth Route Army in Shanxi Province in the winter of 1942. The unit which carried out the operation noted the severity of the mustard gas attack, and it also commented about the anti-Japanese sentiment which existed among the members of the civilian population who were affected by the mustard gas.

===Torture of prisoners of war===

Japanese imperial forces employed widespread use of torture on prisoners of war, usually in an effort to gather military intelligence quickly. Tortured POWs were often later executed. A former Japanese Army officer who served in China, Uno Shintaro, stated:

After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II, the Japanese secret police tortured a captured American P-51 fighter pilot named Marcus McDilda to discover how many atomic bombs the Allies had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who had originally told his captors he knew nothing about the atomic bomb (and who indeed knew nothing about nuclear fission), &quot;confessed&quot; under further torture that the US had 100 atomic bombs and that Tokyo and Kyoto were the next targets:
According to many historians, one of the favorite techniques of Japanese torturers was &quot;simulated drowning&quot;, in which water was poured over the immobilized victim&#x27;s head, until they suffocated and lost consciousness. They were then resuscitated brutally (usually with the torturer jumping on their abdomen to expel the water) and then subjected to a new session of torture. The entire process could be repeated for about twenty minutes.

===Execution and killing of captured Allied airmen===
Many Allied airmen captured by the Japanese on land or at sea were executed in accordance with official Japanese policy. During the Battle of Midway in June 1942, three American airmen who were shot down and landed at sea were spotted and captured by Imperial Japanese Navy warships. After being tortured, machinist mate first class Bruno Gaido and his pilot Ensign Frank O&#x27;Flaherty were tied to five-gallon kerosene cans filled with water and dumped overboard from the ; a third airman, Ensign Wesley Osmus, was fatally wounded with an axe before being pushed into the sea from the stern of the &quot;Arashi&quot;.

On 13 August 1942, Japan passed the Enemy Airmen&#x27;s Act, which stated that Allied pilots who bombed non-military targets in the Pacific Theater and were captured by Japanese forces were subject to trial and punishment, despite the absence of any international law containing provisions regarding aerial warfare. This legislation was passed in response to the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, in which American B-25 bombers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle bombed Tokyo and other Japanese cities. According to the Hague Convention of 1907 (the only convention Japan had ratified regarding the treatment of prisoners of war), any military personnel captured on land or at sea by enemy troops were to be treated as prisoners of war and not punished for simply being lawful combatants. Eight Doolittle Raiders captured upon landing in China (four months before the passage of the Act) were the first Allied aircrew to be brought before a kangaroo court in Shanghai under the act, charged with strafing of Japanese civilians during the Doolittle Raid. The eight aircrew were forbidden to present any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidence, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were executed by firing squad on 14 October 1942.

The Enemy Airmen&#x27;s Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War. An estimated 132 Allied airmen shot down during the bombing campaign against Japan in 1944–1945 were summarily executed after short kangaroo trials or drumhead courts-martial. Imperial Japanese military personnel deliberately killed 33 American airmen at Fukuoka, including fifteen who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government&#x27;s intention to surrender was announced on 15 August 1945. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied airmen before the Japanese military arrived to take the airmen into custody. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately abandoned in a prison during the bombing of Tokyo on 24–25 May 1945.

===Execution and killing of captured Allied seamen===
*Rear Admiral Takero Kouta, commander of the Japanese First Submarine Force at Truk, on 20 March 1943 sent out to subs under his command an order to kill Merchant Navy crewman after the ship was sunk.
*The United States Merchant Navy ship SS &quot;Jean Nicolet&quot;, torpedoed by on 2 July 1944, off Ceylon at . All of the crew and passengers made it into the lifeboats safely. The I-8 forced the 100 onto the deck of the submarine and then killed most of them. The &quot;I-8&quot; crew shot at both the crew and the lifeboats. The submarine crew took the crew&#x27;s valuables. Those not shot, about 30 crew members, were hit and stabbed on the deck. Seeing a plane, the submarine crew tossed overboard the remaining crew and dived. A Catalina flying boat spotted the crew in the water and sent Royal Navy armed trawler rescued the men. After over 30 hours in the water the crew was rescued on 4 July 1944.
*Merchant Navy SS &quot;Behar&quot; sank on 6 March 1944, in the Indian Ocean, seventy-two merchant seamen made it into lifeboats. They were taken aboard the heavy cruiser Tone and the crew&#x27;s valuables taken. The crew was roped up in painful positions, beaten, and locked in an extremely hot store room. By order of Vice Admiral Sakonju, the crew, men and women, were killed. Sakonju was executed for his war crimes in 1947.
*Japanese submarine I-26, after sinking the merchant ship SS &quot;Richard Hovey&quot; in the Arabian Sea, shot at the crew in their three lifeboats and a two life rafts. &quot;I-26&quot; rammed one lifeboats capsizing it. &quot;I-26&quot; took the captain and three crew POWs. The four survived and were repatriated after the end of the war.
* Planes from the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū sank and killed crew and passengers in the &#x27;s lifeboats, sinking six of the nine boats off Sumatra.
*&quot;I-37&quot; on 27 November 1943 shot and killed eight crewmen in the MV &quot;Scotia&quot; lifeboats. On 22 February 1944 shot at &#x27;s lifeboats, 13 were killed. On 29 February 1944 SS &quot;Ascot&quot; lifeboats were shot at, leaving only seven survivors.
*&quot;I-165&quot; on 18 March 1944 shot at &#x27;s lifeboats, killing 23.
*&quot;I-12&quot; on 28 October 1944 shot at the lifeboats of the SS &quot;John A. Johnson&quot;, killing eleven.
* One survivor, James Blears, a 21-year-old radio operator, of the crew of the , lived to tell of the torture and execution of the lifeboat crew by submarine &quot;I-8&quot;. How many other lifeboat crews did not have survivors is not known.
*Cargo ship Langkoeas lifeboats attacked by I-158 &quot;I-158&quot; on 3 January 1942 sank the Dutch cargo ship and subsequently attacked its lifeboats with machine guns. After interrogating the crew under threat of torture, its commander threw them back into the sea without their lifeboats.
*Tanker Augustina massacre, in the Western Java Sea, 1942, lifeboats machine-gunned, only 2 survived.

===Using Allied nationals as human shields===
The prohibition of using enemy nationals as human shields is based on Article 23 under Section II of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention, which states: &quot;A belligerent is [...] forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country&quot;. A World War I-era 1915 Belgian report stated &quot;[i]f it be not permissible to compel a man to fire on his fellow citizens, neither can he be forced to protect the enemy and to serve as a living screen.&quot;

The application is limited to only enemy nationals and it does not apply to the same persons exposed to dangers from aerial and naval attack since the Fourth Hague Convention only governs land warfare. The 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits parties to the international conflict from using protected persons regardless of nationality as human shields against any type of enemy attacks, closing the gaps mentioned in the preceding sentence.

====Battle of Manila (1945)====
During the Battle of Manila in 1945, Japanese forces used Filipino civilians as human shields to protect their positions against the liberating American troops. Author Damien Lewis wrote &quot;The Japanese defenders had taken thousand of Filipinos–men, females, and children alike–hostage, and were holding them as human shields. Many died in the bombardment and subsequent battles that followed, as the walled city was cleared in bitter street-to-street fighting.&quot; Alec Wahlman wrote:

An American WWII veteran who fought in the 1945 Battle of Manila stated &quot;the Japanese would use Philippine civilians as human shields when they were trying to get away. The Japs would grab them and drag them in front of them. We couldn&#x27;t shoot at the Japanese when they had the civilians in front of them.&quot; When American forces reached Intramuros, they realized 4,000 Filipino civilians were held hostage within the wall, most of whom were rounded up by the Japanese and used as human shields. U.S. commanders demanded the Japanese soldiers to surrender or release the hostages but were met in response with silence. American artillery and infantry assaults on the wall began as a result, killing over 1,000 Japanese and taking 25 prisoners, but the ensuing fight with the Japanese defenders also caused considerable and collateral damage along the way.

The American assault on Intramuros weakened Japanese defenses, and the Japanese decided to release 3,000 hostages, most of them females and children, because most of the men under Japanese captivity were murdered. At the end, the use of human shields along with the Manila massacre by the Japanese resulted in the deaths of 100,000 civilians in the battle.

===Cannibalism===

Many written reports and testimonies which were collected by the Australian War Crimes Section of the Tokyo tribunal, and investigated by prosecutor William Webb (the tribunal&#x27;s future Judge-in-Chief), indicate that Japanese personnel committed acts of cannibalism against Allied prisoners of war in many parts of Asia and the Pacific. In many cases, these acts of cannibalism were inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel which resulted from hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: &quot;cannibalism was often a systematic activity which was conducted by whole squads which were under the command of officers&quot;. This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an Indian POW, &quot;Havildar&quot; Changdi Ram, testified that &quot;[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters ... They cut it [into] small pieces and fried it.&quot;

In some cases, flesh was cut from living people: another Indian POW, &quot;Lance Naik&quot; Hatam Ali (later a citizen of Pakistan), testified in New Guinea and stated:

According to another account by Jemadar Abdul Latif of 4/9 Jat Regiment of the Indian Army who was rescued by the Australian Army at the Sepik Bay in 1945:

Perhaps the most senior officer convicted of cannibalism was Lt Gen. Yoshio Tachibana (立花芳夫,&quot;Tachibana Yoshio&quot;), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on Chichijima, in the Bonin Islands. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana&#x27;s orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and &quot;prevention of honorable burial&quot;. Tachibana was sentenced to death, and hanged.

===Avoidable hunger===
Deaths caused by the diversion of resources to Japanese troops in occupied countries were also considered war crimes, because Article 52 under Section III of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention states that &quot;Requisitions in kind and services ... shall be in proportion to the resources of the country&quot;. Millions of civilians in Southeast Asia – especially in Vietnam and Dutch East Indies, which were major producers of rice – died during the avoidable hunger in 1944–45.

In the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 one to two million Vietnamese starved to death in the Red River delta of northern Vietnam due to the Japanese, as the Japanese seized Vietnamese rice without paying for it. In Phat Diem the Vietnamese farmer Di Ho was one of the few survivors who saw the Japanese steal grain. The North Vietnamese government accused both France and Japan of the famine and said 1–2 million Vietnamese died. Võ An Ninh took photographs of dead and dying Vietnamese during the great famine. Starving Vietnamese were dying throughout northern Vietnam in 1945 due to the Japanese seizure of their crops. By the time the Chinese came to disarm the Japanese forces, Vietnamese corpses were on the streets of Hanoi and had to be cleaned up by students.

===Forced labor===

The Japanese military&#x27;s use of forced labor, by Asian civilians and POWs, also caused many deaths. According to a joint study by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo, and Mark Peattie, more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilised by the &quot;Kōa-in&quot; (Japanese Asia Development Board) to perform forced labour. More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the Burma-Siam Railway.

The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in Java the Japanese military forced between four and ten million &quot;rōmusha&quot; (Japanese: &quot;manual laborers&quot;) to work. About 270 000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, but only 52 000 were repatriated to Java, likely indicating an eighty percent death rate.

According to historian Akira Fujiwara, Emperor Hirohito personally ratified the decision to remove the constraints of international law (The Hague Conventions) on the treatment of Chinese prisoners of war in the directive of 5 August 1937. This notification also advised staff officers to stop using the term &quot;prisoners of war&quot;. The Geneva Convention exempted POWs of sergeant rank or higher from manual labour, and stipulated that prisoners performing work should be provided with extra rations and other essentials. Japan was not a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War at the time, and Japanese forces did not follow the convention, although they ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Wounded and Sick.

Shortly after the war, Japan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry wrote a comprehensive report about Chinese laborers. The report estimated that of some 40,000 Chinese laborers taken to Japan, nearly 7,000 had died by the end of the war. The Japanese burned all copies except for one for the fear of that it might become incriminating evidence at the war crimes trials. In 1958, a Chinese man was discovered hiding in the mountains of Hokkaido. The man did not know that the war was over, and he was one of thousands of laborers who were taken to Japan. This specific event brought attention to Japan&#x27;s use of forced Asian labor during the war.

Korean men and women were the largest group forced into labor in wartime Japan, and many were not able to return to Korea afterwards.

In the 1930s and 1940s the Japanese in Manchukuo forced all members of the indigenous Hezhen ethnic minority into forced labour camps where entire Hezhen clans died, and only 300 Hezhen survived at the end of World War II. The Hezhen population later regrew to 5,000. Hezhen culture was damaged and only a few Hezhen retained traditional knowledge like making fish skin clothing, like the mother of You Wenfeng.

===Rape===
The expressions &quot;ianfu&quot; (慰安婦, ) or &quot;jūgun ianfu&quot; (従軍慰安婦, ) are euphemisms for women used in military brothels in occupied countries, many of whom were forcefully recruited or recruited through fraud, and who are considered victims of sexual assault and/or sexual slavery.

In addition to the systematic use of comfort women, Japanese troops engaged in wholesale rape in Nanjing, China. John Rabe, the leader of a Safety Zone in Nanjing, China, kept a diary during the Nanjing Massacre, and wrote about the Japanese atrocities committed against the people in the Safety Zone.

Japanese soldiers committed mass rapes in Manila massacre in the Philippines. Japanese soldiers in Bayview Hotel, Manila, raped hundreds of Italian, Russian, Spanish, British, American, and Filipino women.

In 1992, historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi published material based on his research in archives at Japan&#x27;s National Institute for Defense Studies. Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the Kōain and &quot;comfort stations&quot;. When Yoshimi&#x27;s findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato Koichi, to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that &quot;Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day&quot;, &quot;The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women&quot;, and that the women were &quot;recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion&quot;.

Japanese veteran Yasuji Kaneko admitted to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the women &quot;cried out, but it didn&#x27;t matter to us whether the women lived or died. We were the emperor&#x27;s soldiers. Whether in military brothels or in the villages, we raped without reluctance.&quot;

The Bahay na Pula in the Philippines was an example of a military-operated garrison where local women were raped.

On 17 April 2007, Yoshimi and another historian, Hirofumi Hayashi, announced the discovery, in the archives of the Tokyo Trials, of seven official documents suggesting that Imperial military forces, such as the &quot;Tokkeitai&quot; (naval secret police), directly coerced women to work in frontline brothels in China, Indochina, and Indonesia. These documents were initially made public at the war crimes trial. In one of these, a lieutenant is quoted as confessing having organized a brothel and having used it himself. Another source refers to &quot;Tokkeitai&quot; members having arrested women on the streets, and after enforced medical examinations, putting them in brothels.

On 12 May 2007, journalist Taichiro Kaijimura announced the discovery of 30 Dutch government documents submitted to the Tokyo tribunal as evidence of a forced massed prostitution incident in 1944 in Magelang.

In other cases, some victims from East Timor testified they were dragged from their homes and forced into prostitution at military brothels even when they were not old enough to have started menstruating and were repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers &quot;night after night&quot;.

A Dutch-Indonesian survivor of sexual slavery, Jan Ruff O&#x27;Herne (who later lived in Australia until her death), who gave evidence to the U.S. committee, said the Japanese Government had failed to take responsibility for its crimes, that it did not want to pay compensation to victims, and that it wanted to rewrite history. Ruff O&#x27;Herne said that she had been raped &quot;day and night&quot; for three months by Japanese soldiers when she was 21.

On 26 June 2007, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed a resolution asking that Japan &quot;should acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its military&#x27;s coercion of women into sexual slavery during the war&quot;. On 30 July 2007, the House of Representatives passed the resolution. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said this decision was &quot;regrettable&quot;.

Scholars have stated that there were as many as 200,000 comfort women, mostly from Korea, and some other countries such as China, Philippines, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Netherlands, and Australia were forced to engage in sexual activity.

Japanese use of Malays, Javanese Thai, Burmese, Filipino, and Vietnamese women as comfort women was corroborated by testimonies. As a result of the rape, many women were infected with sexually transmitted diseases. There were comfort women stations in Malaya, Indonesia, Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Korea.

After the defeat of Japan, some of the non-European victims received no compensation or apology and the exploitation of them was ignored.

As the Dutch implemented a war of attrition and scorched earth, they forced Chinese on Java to flee inland, and the Dutch destroyed all important assets, including Chinese factories and property. Local Indonesians joined in on the Dutch violence against the Chinese, looting Chinese property and trying to attack Chinese citizens. However, when the Japanese troops landed and seized control of Java from the Dutch, to people&#x27;s surprise, the Japanese forced the native Indonesians to stop looting and attacking Chinese and warned the Indonesians they would not tolerate anti-Chinese violence in Java. The Japanese viewed the Chinese in Java and their economic power specifically as important and vital to the Japanese war effort, so they did not physically harm the Chinese of Java, and no known execution or torture of Chinese citizens took place (unlike in other places). There was no violent confrontation between Japanese and Chinese on Java, unlike in British Malaya. The Japanese also allowed Chinese of Java in the Federation of Overseas-Chinese Associations (Hua Chiao Tsung Hui) to form the Keibotai, their own armed Chinese defence corps for protection with Japanese military instructors training them how to shoot and use spears. The Chinese viewed this as important to defending themselves from local Indonesians. The majority of Chinese of Java did not die in the war. It was only after the war ended when Japanese control fell and then the native Indonesians again started attacks against the Chinese of Java when the Japanese were unable to protect them.

In Java, the Japanese heavily recruited Javanese girls as comfort women and brought them to New Guinea, Malaya, Thailand, and other areas foreign to Indonesia besides using them in Java itself. The Japanese brought Javanese women as comfort women to Buru island, and Kalimantan. The Japanese recruited help from local collaborator police of all ethnicities to recruit Javanese girls, with one account accusing Chinese recruiters of tricking a Javanese regent into sending good Javanese girls into prostitution for the Japanese in May 1942. The Japanese also lied to the Javanese telling them that their girls would become waitresses and actresses when recruiting them. The Japanese brought Javanese women as comfort women prostitutes to Kupang in Timor while in East Timor the Japanese took local women in Dili. In Bali, the Japanese sexually harassed Balinese women when they came and started forcing Balinese women into brothels for prostitution, with Balinese men and Chinese men used as recruiters for the Balinese women. All of the brothels in Bali were staffed by Balinese women. In brothels in Kalimantan, native Indonesian women made up 80% of the prostitutes. Javanese girls and local girls were used in a Japanese brothel in Ambon in Batu Gantung. European Dutch women were overrepresented in documents on Dutch East Indies comfort women which did not reflect the actual reality because the Dutch did not care about native Indonesian women being victimised by Japan, refusing to prosecute cases against them since Indonesia was not a UN member at the time. Javanese comfort women who were taken by Japanese to islands outside Java were treated differently depending on whether they stayed on those islands or returned to Java. Since Javanese society was sexually permissive and they kept it secret from other Javanese, the Javanese women who returned to Java fared better, but the Javanese women who stayed on the islands like Buru were treated harsher by their hosts since they locals in Buru were more patriarchal. The Japanese murdered Christians and forced girls into prostitution in Timor and Sumba, desecrating sacred vessels and vestments in churches and using the churches as brothels. Javanese girls were brought as prostitutes by the Japanese to Flores and Buru. Eurasians, Indians, Chinese, Dutch, Menadonese, Bataks, Bugis, Dayaks, Javanese, Arabs, and Malays were arrested and massacred in the Mandor affair.

The Japanese brought Indonesian Javanese girls to British Borneo as comfort women to be raped by Japanese officers at the Ridge road school and Basel Mission Church, and the Telecommunication Center Station (former rectory of the All Saints Church) in Kota Kinabalu as well as ones in Balikpapan and Beaufort. Japanese soldiers raped Indonesian women and Dutch women in the Netherlands East Indies. Many of the women were infected with STDs as a result. Sukarno prostituted Indonesian girls from ethnic groups like Minangkabau to the Japanese. The Japanese destroyed many documents related to their rape of Indonesian Javanese girls at the end of the war so the true extent of the mass rape is uncountable, but testimony witnesses records the names and accounts of Indonesian Javanese comfort women.

Japanese in one instance tried to disguise the Javanese comfort girls they were raping as red cross nurses with red cross armbands when they surrendered to Australian soldiers in Kupang, Timor.

In addition to disguising the Java girls with Red Cross armbands some Dutch girls were also brought to Kupang and native girls from Kupang were also kidnapped by the Japanese while the native men were forced into hard labour.

Indian and Javanese captives in Biak were freed from Japanese control by Allied forces.

Only 70,000 Javanese survived out of 260,000 Javanese forced to labour on the death railway between Burma and Thailand.

In August 1945, the Japanese were getting ready to execute female European internees by shooting in the Dutch East Indies and their plans were only stopped by the atomic bomb with the plans and list of detainees already written down.

Francis Stanley (Frank) Terry, an Australian sailor on a naval vessel, participated in the repatriation of Indonesian Javanese comfort women from islands across Indonesia back to their home.

The Dutch royal family and government seized the money from Japanese comfort women prostitution in the Dutch East Indies territory for itself instead of compensating the women.

The Japanese forced Javanese women to work in brothels and Javanese men to become forced labour at airstrips in Labuan, Borneo. The Javanese men were worked to starvation, resembling skeletons, barely able to move and were sick with beri beri by the time they were freed in June 1945 by Australians. The Japanese reserved a house as a brothel and officer&#x27;s club on Fox Road in Labuan.

On 28 August 1945, the British and Australians gave medical treatment to 300 Javanese and Malay men slaves of the Japanese who were malnourished and starving from forced labour.

Many Indonesian comfort females were reluctant to talk about their experiences due to shame. A 10-year-old Indonesian girl named Niyem from Karamangmojo in Yogyakarta was repeatedly raped for two months by Japanese soldiers along with other Indonesian girls in West Java. She did not tell her parents what the Japanese did to her when she managed to flee.

The Japanese killed four million Indonesians. After the defeat of Japan, the Dutch generally did not care about Japanese rape of non-white, native Indonesian Muslim girls and most of the time they only charged Japanese war criminals for rape of white Dutch women.

Suharto silenced public discussion in Indonesian on Japanese war crimes in Indonesia in order to stop anti-Japanese sentiment building up but it happened regardless when the movie Romusha came out in 1973 and the Peristiwa Malari (Malari affair) riots broke out in Indonesia in 1974 against Japan. Suharto also sought to silence discussion on Japanese war crimes due to Indonesia&#x27;s own war crimes in East Timor after 1975, but Indonesians started talking about Indonesian comfort women in the 1990s following the example of Korea. Mardyiem, a Javanese Indonesian comfort woman talked about what happened to her after Indonesian comfort women were interviewed by Japanese lawyers, after decades of being forced to stay silent.

Three major revolts happened against Japan by Indonesians in Java. Japanese forced Indonesians of West Java in Cirebon to hand over a massive quota of rice to the Japanese military with Japanese officers using brutality to extract even more than the official quota. The Indonesians in Cirebon rebelled twice and targeted Indonesian collaborator bureaucrats and Japanese officers in 1944. Japan killed a lot of Indonesian rebels while crushing them with deadly force. In Sukmana, Singapurna, the Tasikmalaya regency, the conservative religious teacher Kiai Zainal Mustafa told his followers that in the month when Muhammad was born they would gain divine protection when he gave a sign. In February 1943, Japanese Kempeitai caught wind of what was happening and came to the area but the roads were blocked to stop them. The Indonesian villagers and students began to fight the Japanese and seized the sabre of the Japanese chief to kill him. More Japanese arrived and 86 Japanese and 153 Indonesian villagers died in the fighting. The Japanese then arrested Zainal and 22 others for execution. Supriyadi lead a Peta mutiny against the Japanese in February 1945.

Japanese raped Malay comfort women but UMNO leader Najib Razak blocked all attempts by other UMNO members like Mustapha Yakub at asking Japan for compensation and apologies.

The threat of Japanese rape against Chitty girls led Chitty families to let Eurasians, Chinese, and full-blooded Indians to marry Chitty girls and stop practicing endogamy.

Japanese soldiers gang raped Indian Tamil girls and women they forced to work on the Burma railway and made them dance naked. 150,000 Tamils were killed on the railway by Japanese brutality. Tamils who got sick from cholera were executed by the Japanese. As Tamil women got raped by Japanese, the Japanese soldiers contracted venereal diseases like soft sore, syphilis, and gonorrhoea, and Thai women also spread those diseases to coolies on the railroad.

===Looting and destruction of heritage===
Several scholars have claimed that the Japanese government, along with Japanese military personnel, engaged in widespread looting during the period of 1895 to 1945. The stolen property included private land, as well as many different kinds of valuable goods looted from banks, depositories, vaults, temples, churches, mosques, art galleries, commercial offices, libraries (including Buddhist monasteries), museums and other commercial premises, and private homes.

In China, an eyewitness, journalist F. Tillman of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, sent an article to his newspaper where he described the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s entry into Nanjing in December 1937: &quot;The plunder carried out by the Japanese reached almost the entire city. Almost all buildings were entered by Japanese soldiers, often in the sight of their officers, and the men took whatever they wanted. Japanese soldiers often forced Chinese to carry the loot.&quot;

In Korea, it is estimated that about 100,000 priceless artifacts and cultural goods were looted by Japanese colonial authorities and private collectors during the nearly fifty years of military occupation. The Administration claims that there are 41,109 cultural objects which are located in Japan but remain unreported by the Japanese authorities. Unlike the works of art looted by Nazis in Europe, the return of property to its rightful owners, or even the discussion of financial reparations in the post-war period, met with strong resistance from the American government, particularly General Douglas MacArthur.

According to several historians, MacArthur&#x27;s disagreement was not based on issues of rights, ethics, or morals, but on political convenience. He spoke on the topic in a radio message to the U.S. Army in May 1948, the transcript of which was found by the magazine &quot;Time&quot; in the U.S. National Archives. In it, MacArthur states: &quot;I am completely at odds with the minority view of replacing lost or destroyed cultural property as a result of military action and occupation&quot;. With the advent of the Cold War, the general feared &quot;embittering the Japanese people towards us and making Japan vulnerable to ideological pressures and a fertile ground for subversive action&quot;.

Kyoichi Arimitsu, one of the last living survivors of the Japanese archeological missions which operated on the Korean peninsula, which started early in the twentieth century, agrees that the plunder in the 1930s was out of control, but that researchers and academics, such as himself, had nothing to do with it. However, he recognizes that the excavated pieces which were deemed to be most historically significant were sent to the Japanese governor-general, who then decided what would be sent to Emperor Hirohito.

In 1965, when Japan and South Korea negotiated a treaty to reestablish diplomatic relations the issue of returning the cultural artifacts was raised. However, the then South Korean dictator, Park Chung Hee, preferred to receive cash compensation that would allow him to build highways and steelworks; works of art and cultural goods were not a priority. As a result, at the time the Koreans had to settle for the return of only 1,326 items, including 852 rare books and 438 ceramic pieces. The Japanese claim that this put an end to any Korean claim regarding reparation for cultural goods (or of any other nature). American journalist Brad Glosserman has stated that an increasing number of South Koreans are raising the issue of the repatriation of stolen cultural artifacts from Japan due to rising affluence among the general populace as well as increased national confidence.

Hundreds of Utsul Muslim houses and mosques in Sanya, Hainan were destroyed by the Japanese in order to build an airport.

===Perfidy===

Throughout the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers often feigned injury or surrender to lure approaching American forces before attacking them. An alleged example of this was the &quot;Goettge Patrol&quot; during the early days of the Guadalcanal Campaign in August 1942. After the patrol believed they saw a white flag displayed on the west bank of Matanikau River, Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Frank Goettge assembled 25 men, primarily consisting of intelligence personnel, to search the area. Unknown to the patrol, the white flag was actually a Japanese flag with the &quot;Hinomaru&quot; disc insignia obscured. A Japanese prisoner was plied with alcohol and in his drunken state mistakenly revealed that there were a number of Japanese soldiers west of the Matanikau River who wanted to surrender. The Goettge Patrol landed by boat west of the Lunga Point perimeter, between Point Cruz and the Matanikau River, on a reconnaissance mission to contact a group of Japanese troops that American forces thought was willing to surrender. The Japanese soldiers were not in fact about to surrender and soon after the patrol landed the group of Japanese naval troops ambushed and almost completely wiped out the patrol. Goettge was among the dead. Only three Americans made it back to American lines in the Lunga Point perimeter alive.

News of the killing and supposed treachery by the Japanese outraged the American Marines:

Second Lieutenant D. A. Clark of the 7th Marines told a similar story while patrolling Guadalcanal:

Samuel Eliot Morison, in his book, &quot;The Two-Ocean War: A Short History of the United States Navy in the Second World War&quot;, wrote:

These incidents, along with many other perfidious actions of the Japanese throughout the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those attempting to surrender and not readily take them as prisoners of war. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided:

Another reported,

===Attacks on hospital ships===

Hospital ships are painted white with large red crosses to show they are not combat ships but vessels carrying wounded people and medical staff. Japan had signed the Hague Convention X of 1907 that stated attacking a hospital ship is a war crime.
* On 23 April 1945, was struck by a Japanese suicide plane. The plane crashed through three decks, exploding in surgery, which was filled with medical personnel and patients. Casualties were 28 killed (including six nurses) and 48 wounded, with considerable damage done to the ship.
* was attacked and damaged during the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Okinawa.
* USS &quot;Relief&quot; was attacked and damaged at Guam on 2 April 1945.
* On 19 February 1942, the Australian HMHS &quot;Manunda&quot; was dive-bombed during the Japanese air raids on Darwin; twelve crew and hospital staff were killed and nineteen others were seriously wounded.
* On 14 May 1943, the Australian was sunk by off Stradbroke Island, Queensland with 268 lives lost.
* The Royal Netherlands Navy hospital ship was bombed on 21 February 1942, in the Java Sea. One surgeon and three nurses were killed, and eleven were badly wounded. After repairs, on 28 February 1942, she was commandeered by the near Bawean Island. The Japanese forced her to transport their POWs. On 20 December 1942, she became the &quot;Tenno Maru&quot;, a Japanese hospital ship, and the Dutch crew became POWs. As the war came to an end, the ship was first modified and later sunk to cover up the crime.

===War crimes in Vietnam===

The Viet Minh had begun fighting the Vichy French in 1944, then began attacking the Japanese in early 1945 after Japan replaced the French government on 9 March 1945. After the Viet Minh rejected Japanese demands to cease fighting and support Japan, the Japanese implemented the Three Alls policy (San Kuang) against the Vietnamese, pillaging, burning, killing, torturing, and raping Vietnamese women.

Japanese officers ordered their soldiers to behead and burn Vietnamese. Some claimed that Taiwanese and Manchurian soldiers in the Japanese army were participating in atrocities against the Vietnamese.

The Japanese on occasion attacked Vietnamese while masquerading as Viet Minh. They also tried to play the Vietnamese against the French by spreading false rumours that the French were massacring Vietnamese at the time to distract the Vietnamese from Japanese atrocities. Similarly, they attempted to play the Laotians against the Vietnamese by inciting Lao people to kill Vietnamese, as Lao murdered seven Vietnamese officials in Luang Prabang and Lao youths were recruited to an anti-Vietnam organization by the Japanese when they took over Luang Prabang.

The Japanese also started openly looting the Vietnamese. In addition to taking French-owned properties Japanese soldiers stole watches, pencils, bicycles, money, and clothing.

Vietnam was in the grip of a famine in 1945 caused in part by Japanese requisition of food without payment; the Japanese beheaded Vietnamese who stole bread and corn while they were starving. The Vietnamese professor Văn Tạo and Japanese professor Furuta Moto both conducted a study in the field on the Japanese induced famine of 1945 admitting that Japan killed two million Vietnamese by starvation.

On 25 March 2000, the Vietnamese journalist Trần Khuê wrote an article () in which he harshly criticized ethnographers and historians in Ho Chi Minh City&#x27;s Institute of Social Sciences such as Dr. Đinh Văn Liên and Professor Mạc Đường for trying to whitewash Japan&#x27;s atrocities against the Vietnamese by, among other things, changing the death toll of two million Vietnamese dead at the hands of the Japanese famine to one million, calling the Japanese invasion as a presence and calling Japanese fascists as simply Japanese at the Vietnam-Japan international conference.

==War crimes trials==

Soon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as Class-A war criminals, and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal courts. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These indicted war criminals included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Korean people. Class A criminals were all tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, also known as &quot;the Tokyo Trials&quot;. Other courts were held in numerous places across Asia and the Pacific.

===Tokyo Trials===
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.

High-ranking officers who were tried included Kōichi Kido and Sadao Araki. Three former (unelected) prime ministers: Kōki Hirota, Hideki Tojo, and Kuniaki Koiso were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.
* Mamoru Shigemitsu served as Minister for Foreign Affairs both during the war and in the post-war Hatoyama government.
* Okinori Kaya was Minister of Finance during the war and later served as Minister of Justice in the government of Hayato Ikeda. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.

Hirohito and all members of the Imperial House of Japan implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Takeda and Prince Higashikuni were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by Douglas MacArthur, with the help of Bonner Fellers who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.

Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, &quot;with the full support of MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor&quot; and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime &quot;cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.&quot; For Herbert Bix, &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.&quot;

MacArthur&#x27;s reasoning was that if the emperor were executed or sentenced to life imprisonment, there would be a violent backlash and revolution from the Japanese from all social classes, which would interfere with his primary goal to change Japan from a militarist, semi-feudal society to a pro-Western modern democracy. In a cable sent to General Dwight D. Eisenhower in February 1946, MacArthur said executing or imprisoning the emperor would require the use of one million occupation soldiers to keep the peace.

===Other trials===


Between 1945 and 1956, the Chinese, Americans, British, Australians, Dutch, French, and Filipinos held trials at forty-nine locations. Australian prosecutors collaborated with British and American courts to hold Japanese individuals accountable, conducting trials for numerous individuals in Amboina, Dutch East Indies, and Rabaul, New Britain. China prosecuted at least 800 individuals, including some linked to the Nanjing massacre, while France and the Netherlands tried several hundred others. The French prosecuted a Japanese civilian in Java for forcing many women into military prostitution, and the Dutch sentenced Japanese individuals to death for murdering local residents and Dutch prisoners. In late 1949, the Soviet Union also put twelve Japanese on trial in Khabarovsk for biological warfare offenses—six were from Unit 731, two from Unit 100, and four from other groups. Later, several hundred Japanese people suspected of war crimes were handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where they faced trials in the mid-1950s.

Approximately 4,300 of the 5,379 Japanese, 173 Taiwanese, and 148 Koreans tried as Class B and C war criminals were convicted of conventional crimes, such as rape, murder, violations of the rules of war, and mistreatment of prisoners of war. Hundreds were given life sentences, while nearly 1,000 were given death sentences.

The largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the summary execution of more than 300 Allied POWs in the Laha massacre (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General Hong Sa Ik, who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the South Korean government &quot;pardoned&quot; 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals. One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes; 11 were executed.

While German doctors were prosecuted and their crimes made public, the U.S. kept details of Japanese biological warfare experiments hidden and granted immunity to those responsible. In contrast to the immunity given to those involved with Unit 731, the U.S. conducted a tribunal in Yokohama in 1948, where nine Japanese physician professors and medical students were charged with vivisecting captured American pilots. Two professors received death sentences, and the others were sentenced to 15–20 years in prison.

==Post-war events and reactions==

===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===

The British authorities lacked the resources and will to fully commit themselves to pursuing Japanese war criminals.

On 4 September 1952, President Truman issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.

On 26 May 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles rejected a proposed amnesty for the imprisoned war criminals but instead agreed to &quot;change the ground rules&quot; by reducing the period required for eligibility for parole from 15 years to 10.

===Official apologies===

Several Japanese government officials and former Japanese emperors have acknowledged Japanese war atrocities committed in China.
The Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, in August 1995, stated that Japan &quot;through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations&quot;, and he expressed his &quot;feelings of deep remorse&quot; and stated his &quot;heartfelt apology&quot;. Also, on 29 September 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka stated: &quot;[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.&quot;

However, apologizes made by Japanese officials have been criticized as insincere. For example, in the Kono Statement, while Japanese officials acknowledge the japanese military&#x27;s involvement in the comfort women system, they denied the coercion and forced transportation of the woman and refused to offer compensation to the victims.

The official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. In October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party paid visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed &quot;regret&quot; or &quot;remorse&quot;. On 2 March 2007, the issue was raised again by Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe, in which he denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. He stated, &quot;The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion.&quot; Before he spoke, a group of LDP lawmakers also sought to revise the Kono Statement. This provoked negative reaction from Asian and Western countries.

Emperor Showa initiated an official boycott of the Yasukuni Shrine after learning that Class-A war criminals had been covertly enshrined there after the war. This boycott remained in place from 1978 until his death and has been upheld by his successors, Akihito and Naruhito.

On 31 October 2008, the chief of staff of Japan&#x27;s Air Self-Defense Force Toshio Tamogami was dismissed with a 60 million yen allowance due to an essay he published, arguing that Japan was not an aggressor during World War II, that the war brought prosperity to China, Taiwan, and Korea, that the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s conduct was not violent and that the Greater East Asia War is viewed in a positive way by many Asian countries and criticizing the war crimes trials which followed the war. On 11 November, Tamogami added before the Diet that the personal apology made in 1995 by former prime minister Tomiichi Murayama was &quot;a tool to suppress free speech&quot;.

Some in Japan have asserted that what is being demanded is that the Japanese Prime Minister or the Emperor perform &quot;dogeza&quot;, in which an individual kneels and bows his head to the ground—a high form of apology in East Asian societies that Japan appears unwilling to do. Some point to an act by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who knelt at a monument to the Jewish victims of the Warsaw Ghetto, in 1970, as an example of a powerful and effective act of apology and reconciliation similar to dogeza.

On 13 September 2010, Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada met in Tokyo with six former American POWs of the Japanese and apologized for their treatment during World War II. Okada said: &quot;You have all been through hardships during World War II, being taken prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered extremely inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese government and as the foreign minister, I would like to offer you my heartfelt apology.&quot;

On 29 November 2011, Japanese Foreign Minister Kōichirō Genba apologized to former Australian POWs on behalf of the Japanese government for pain and suffering inflicted on them during the war.

===Compensation===
The Japanese government, while admitting no legal responsibility for comfort women, set up the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund in 1995, which gives money to people who were forced into prostitution during the war. Though the organisation was established by the government, legally, it has been created such that it is an independent charity. The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.

Some argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims&#x27; own governments. California Congressman Mike Honda, speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that &quot;without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds. In fact, as you will hear today, many Comfort Women returned the Prime Minister&#x27;s letter of apology accompanying the monetary compensation, saying they felt the apology was artificial and disingenuous.&quot;

====Compensation under the San Francisco Treaty====
=====Compensation from Japanese overseas assets=====
&quot;Japanese overseas assets&quot; refers to all assets which were owned by the Japanese government, firms, organizations, and private citizens, in colonized or occupied countries. In accordance with Clause 14 of the San Francisco Treaty, Allied forces confiscated all Japanese overseas assets, except those in China, which were dealt with under Clause 21.

=====Compensation to Allied POWs=====
According to historian Linda Goetz Holmes, many funds used by the government of Japan were not Japanese funds but relief funds contributed by the governments of the US, the UK, and the Netherlands and sequestered in the Yokohama Specie Bank during the final year of the war.

=====Allied territories occupied by Japan=====
Clause 14 of the treaty stated that Japan would enter into negotiations with the Allied nations whose territories were occupied and suffered damage by Japanese forces, with a view to Japan compensating those countries for the damage.

===Historical negationism and denialism in Japan===
In numerous historical debates within the region, Japan has been criticized for its failure to adequately address its imperial past. Key issues include the visits of Japanese prime ministers to the contentious Yasukuni Shrine, ongoing denials of state involvement in the system of forced wartime prostitution, efforts to justify the Asia-Pacific War, legal rulings rejecting state compensation for forced labor, and the positive assessments of Japan&#x27;s colonial period. These issues have periodically strained Japan&#x27;s relations with its crucial neighbors, particularly the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.

Nippon Kaigi is an influential ultra-right-wing lobby group that wields considerable power in shaping Japanese politics. As of 2015, its membership boasts prominent figures such as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, approximately 80% of the cabinet, and nearly half of the country&#x27;s parliamentarians. This organization is infamous for its historical negationism and denial of certain war crimes The organization denies the Nanjing Massacre, labelling it as exaggerated or fabricated.
Historical negationism concerning the comfort women issue has been predominantly led by the Nippon Kaigi since the mid-1990s, with significant efforts notably observed during both the initial and second Abe administration.

Following a Cabinet meeting during Shinzo Abe&#x27;s initial tenure as prime minister in 2007, the administration said that there was no documented evidence supporting the coerced recruitment of comfort women. This stance was the official position of the administration and is reinforced through collaboration with Japanese right-wing media outlets.

====Textbook controversy====

The existing regulations regarding textbooks grant the government absolute authority to determine which textbooks should be adopted by local schools. School boards, teacher unions, and local citizens, traditionally more left-leaning groups that have opposed government-approved books, have experienced a significant erosion of their autonomy in selecting textbooks, compelling them to adopt government-censored textbooks.

In 1952, the Japanese government instructed Japanese historian Ienaga Saburo to eliminate information and references from his textbook regarding Unit 731, despite having his claims corroborated by other scholars. While Ienaga&#x27;s legal action against the Japanese government initially compelled them to publish his textbooks detailing Japanese war crimes, the Japanese Supreme Court overturned this decision in 1993. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1993 ruling affirmed the government&#x27;s authority to compel Mr. Ienaga to remove unsettling specifics concerning the Japanese invasions of Manchuria and Korea, as well as the rapes and killings committed by Japanese military personnel during their occupation of East and Southeast Asia.

Textbooks approved for junior high schools in 1997 typically presented relatively high estimates of the number of victims, but those published in 2005 often refrained from providing specific numbers altogether. Similarly, the term &quot;massacre&quot; was largely replaced with the term &quot;incident.&quot;

In 2014, the Japanese government attempted to pressure McGraw Hill, an American publishing company, to remove two paragraphs addressing the issue of comfort women from one of their textbooks. McGraw Hill rejected the demands from the Japanese government, and American historians condemned Japan&#x27;s attempt to alter the historical account of comfort women.

In 2015, other alterations involve six out of seven textbooks reducing the criticism of the Japanese military&#x27;s role in mass suicides among Okinawans in 1945. Additionally, only one textbook addressed the topic of comfort women.

In 2022, the Japanese government made changes to 14 textbooks covering Japanese and world history. The ministry replaced the words &quot;forced arrest&quot; and &quot;forced conscription&quot; with &quot;mobilization&quot; and &quot;conscription&quot; when recounting the history of forced laborers in Japan, including Koreans during the period of Japanese annexation of Korea from 1910 to 1945.

===Later investigations===

As with investigations of Nazi war criminals, official investigations and inquiries are still ongoing. During the 1990s, the South Korean government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military. In South Korea, it is also alleged that during the political climate of the Cold War, many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.

Further evidence has been discovered as a result of these investigations. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women. Some have cited Japanese inventory logs and employee sheets on the battlefield as evidence for this claim. For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.

In 2011, it was alleged in an article published in the &quot;Japan Times&quot; newspaper by Jason Coskrey that the British government covered up a Japanese massacre of British and Dutch POWs to avoid straining the recently re-opened relationship with Japan, along with their belief that Japan needed to be a post-war bulwark against the spread of communism.

Tamaki Matsuoka&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;Torn Memories of Nanjing&quot; includes interviews with Japanese veterans who admit to raping and killing Chinese civilians.

===Concerns of the Japanese imperial family===

Potentially in contrast to Prime Minister Abe&#x27;s example of his Yasukuni Shrine visits, by February 2015, some concern within the Imperial House of Japan — which normally does not issue such statements – over the issue was voiced by then-Crown Prince Naruhito, who succeeded his father on 1 May 2019. Naruhito stated on his 55th birthday (23 February 2015) that it was &quot;important to look back on the past humbly and correctly&quot;, in reference to Japan&#x27;s role in World War II-era war crimes, and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to &quot;correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade&quot;. Two visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in the second half of 2016 by Japan&#x27;s former foreign minister, Masahiro Imamura, were again followed by controversy that still showed potential for concern over how Japan&#x27;s World War II history may be remembered by its citizens as it entered the Reiwa era.

Emperor Shōwa upheld an official boycott of Yasukuni Shrine after he discovered that Class-A war criminals had been secretly enshrined after the war. This boycott lasted from 1978 until his death, and his successors, Akihito and Naruhito, have continued the boycott.

==Service history==
===As USS &quot;Bagley&quot; and USS &quot;Doran&quot;===

Named for Ensign Worth Bagley, she was launched 19 October 1918 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Adelaide Worth Bagley, mother of Ensign Bagley, commissioned 27 August 1919 and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

Between August 1919 and July 1920 &quot;Bagley&quot; served in destroyer Flotillas 1, 3, and 8 participating in maneuvers and training in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She was placed in reserve commission 16 July 1920 and out of commission at Philadelphia 12 July 1922. During 25 April 1932 – 20 April 1934 she was on loan to the Coast Guard.

The name &quot;Bagley&quot; was dropped 31 May 1935 and, until 1939, she was referred to as DD-185 (ex-&quot;Bagley&quot;). She was renamed Doran 22 December 1939, for John James Doran. Recommissioned 17 June 1940, she reported to the Atlantic Squadron. &quot;Doran&quot; served with the Squadron until 22 September 1940, when she was decommissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transferred under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement to the United Kingdom.

===As HMS &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;===
She was renamed HMS &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; and arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, 8 October 1940. Assigned to the permanent escort force of the 1st Minelaying Squadron, she arrived on the west coast of Scotland 31 October and took part in some of the early minelaying operations in Denmark Strait, between Iceland and Greenland. She also escorted a number of convoys. During 1941 she took part in most of the Squadron&#x27;s minelaying operations and rendered service in the defense of shipping. On 29 August 1941, she collided with the transport &quot;Royal Ulsterman&quot; off the west coast of Scotland and was in Salford Docks until December.

&quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; carried out minelaying and shipping defense duties in 1942 and 1943. In February 1944 she was paid off in the Tyne and remained there until the end of the war, when she was scrapped.

<text>Tukoroirangi &quot;Tuku&quot; Morgan (born 7 October 1957) is a New Zealand Māori politician and former broadcaster. 

Morgan has been a prominent political figure since the 1990s. Since 2022, he has served as the chair of Te Arataura, which is the executive board of Te Whakakitenga, the governing council of the Waikato Tainui tribal confederation. He previously chaired Te Arataura from 2006 until 2012 and is a former advisor to Kingi Tuheitia.

Morgan was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1996 to 1999 for New Zealand First and Mauri Pacific. He was the president of the Maori Party from 2016 to 2017.

==Early life and family==
Born in Auckland on 7 October 1957, Morgan affiliates to the Tainui iwi confederation. He was raised under whāngai adoption by his grandparents at Waahi marae in Huntly. The household spoke te reo Māori as their first language and Morgan once stated the only time English was spoken was when he would read aloud from the newspaper to his grandfather. His grandparents were close to the kingitanga and did not have formal employment; the only income the family received was a family benefit.

Morgan was educated at St Stephen&#x27;s School, Bombay from 1970 to 1971, and Huntly College from 1971 to 1976. He then gained a Diploma of Teaching from Epsom Teachers&#x27; College and taught English and Māori studies at Huntly College from 1980 to 1982, then at Birkdale College (1982). In the 1980s, Morgan attended a Māori land protest where he was convicted of obstructing a police officer and ordered to do community service.

Morgan married Carolyn Brown (Ngāti Porou), whom he met at teachers&#x27; college. They share three children. Morgan&#x27;s brother-in-law is Tau Henare (their wives are sisters).

==Broadcasting career==
In 1984, Morgan was hired as one of the first reporters on &quot;Te Karere&quot;, New Zealand&#x27;s first Māori-language news programme which was broadcast by Television New Zealand. He then moved to rival broadcaster TV3 as a mainstream news reporter. He briefly worked outside of the media, as manager of the Tainui Health Authority, Raukura Hauora o Tainui.

Later, he was involved in the establishment of the short-lived Aotearoa Television Network, New Zealand&#x27;s first Māori-language broadcaster, which began operations in 1996. Morgan was the network&#x27;s head of sport, youth and current affairs programmes and also a news presenter. 

==Member of Parliament==


Morgan was elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as the New Zealand First MP for Te Tai Hauāuru. New Zealand First captured all five Māori electorates in the 1996 election (including Te Tai Hauāuru). Morgan and the other four Māori electorate MPs became known as the Tight Five. 

After the election, New Zealand First formed a coalition government with the National Party. Morgan had reportedly preferred New Zealand First to work with Labour. He was not given a ministerial role in the government and was appointed a member of the Māori affairs and the health committee. He had been expected to be the government&#x27;s nominee to chair the Māori affairs committee, but withdrew his nomination because of a controversy early in the term.

In February 1997, it emerged that two weeks before the general election, Morgan had spent $4,000 of Aotearoa Television funds on clothes including an $89 pair of Hugo Boss underpants, among other alleged financial misuse by the company&#x27;s directors. Morgan stated the spending was from a clothing budget for on-air presenters; however, he was no longer in an on-air role with the network at the time the spending was made. The expenditure was controversial because the Māori affairs minister, Morgan&#x27;s brother-in-law Tau Henare, had announced $4 million of new government funding for the network the month prior (the provision of which was later withdrawn). In a special debate in Parliament on 18 February, calls were made for Morgan to resign from Parliament, including by Alliance MP Sandra Lee who criticised Morgan for &quot;endanger[ing] the aspirations of Māori.&quot; Morgan refused to resign. In his maiden speech, delivered on 25 February 1997, he addressed the controversy, saying he &quot;would never be caught with his pants down again.&quot;

Morgan sponsored two member&#x27;s bills which were debated in Parliament. He inherited the Taonga Maori Protection Bill from Henare in 1996 and it was debated in 1998. The bill proposed establishing a national trust for the purposes of protecting and repatriating taonga. The bill was considered and endorsed by the Māori affairs committee and approved for continuation by Parliament in a 111-7 vote on 1 September 1999. The bill was adopted by the subsequent Labour government after the 1999 election and eventually discharged in 2004. Morgan also promoted the Smoke-free Environments (Enhanced Protection) Amendment Bill in July 1999, which was transferred to Steve Chadwick after the election.

The coalition government broke down in August 1998. Morgan resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, becoming an independent MP. He later joined the newly formed Mauri Pacific. In the 1999 election, Morgan was ranked second on Mauri Pacific&#x27;s party list. He contested the Te Tai Hauāuru seat again, but was not returned to Parliament. He then returned to television and film production and also opened an art shop on Ponsonby Road.

==Life after parliament==
Morgan was chair of Te Arataura, the Waikato-Tainui executive board, from 2003 to 2004, when he was removed from office because of a criminal conviction for obstructing police during a protest march in the 1980s. He returned after a rule change in 2006 and held that role until 2012. He was also appointed to a two-year term as a director of Auckland Council Property, a council-controlled organisation of the Auckland Council from 2010.

In 2015 he became the Māori Party&#x27;s co-chair of the Hauraki-Waikato electorate. In July 2016 he was elected as president of the Māori Party. As president, he set the party&#x27;s goal of winning all seven Māori electorates at the 2017 general election. In the event, the party lost all seven electorates to Labour and was not eligible to return to Parliament. Morgan resigned in December 2017 and called for the party&#x27;s co-leaders to follow suit.

In August 2018, he published an open letter to the Māori King Tūheitia Paki, whose advisor he had previously been, detailing a number of criticisms of Paki&#x27;s behaving, including his continued support and employment of Rangi Whakaruru as chief of staff. He rejoined the Te Arataura board in 2021 and regained the chair in 2022.

<doc id="1120233" wikidata="Q4925268" url="?curid=1120233" title="Percy–Neville feud">
<text>The Percy–Neville feud was a series of skirmishes, raids, and vandalism between two prominent northern English families, the House of Percy and the House of Neville, and their followers, that helped provoke the Wars of the Roses. The original reason for the long dispute is unknown, and the first outbreaks of violence were in the 1450s, prior to the Wars of the Roses. The antagonists would later meet in battle several times during the feud.

==Origins and context==

Yorkshire&#x27;s three ridings were divided among the crown (as Duke of Lancaster), the Percy family, Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. The King and the Duke of York do not seem to have visited Yorkshire very often, which Ralph Griffiths suggests meant that any tension would be solely between Percy and Neville. Since the city of York was the most important, the capital city of the north, it &#x27;provided a focus for their rivalries&#x27;. It is not, he said, a coincidence that &#x27;the two virtual battles between Percy and Neville in 1453 and 1454 were fought close to the city&#x27;s walls&#x27;. He also suggests that Percy tenants may have been as anti-Neville as their lords, since their estates were contiguous, this could have encouraged rivalry and bred antagonism. As Professor Pollard has pointed out, Neville retained some of his knights from &#x27;deep in Percy country, particularly southern Northumberland&#x27;.

Griffiths has suggested that by the mid-fifteenth century, relations between Percy and Neville were &#x27;poisoned by jealousy and resentment&#x27;. He has pointed out that Salisbury probably did not expect- and not receive- the assistance of the Raby branch of his family (by his father&#x27;s first wife, Margaret Stafford), which he puts down to the previous feud between the two branches of the family, over the division of Westmorland&#x27;s will. Robin Storey has also pointed out how Northumberland seems to have been receiving less royal favour than Salisbury. He points out that when trouble came, it was to be the earls&#x27; sons, not the lords, that would start it. The degree to which the two earls were assisting and encouraging the feud behind the scenes has also been questioned. Griffiths has said that Thomas and John were Salisbury&#x27;s direct representatives in it.

==Immediate causes for the feud==
Various immediate causes having been ascribed to causing the outbreak of violence in 1454. Professor Griffiths has suggested that Lord Cromwell&#x27;s manor of Wressle, Yorkshire, was seized by the Percys following the joining of the Cromwell and Neville families in marriage in 1453 (see below), and that Cromwell viewed the Nevilles as allies against the Percys. Likewise, Warwick&#x27;s feud with Somerset in south Glamorgan may have driven him into an alliance with the Duke of York against him. Griffiths also suggests that the single most important event to precipitate the feud was the marriage of Salisbury&#x27;s second son, Thomas Neville to Maud Stanhope, the widow of Robert, Lord Willoughby. Not only, says Griffiths, was any further aggrandisement for Salisbury&#x27;s family anathema to the Percys, but the new Cromwell connection gave the Nevilles access to the ex-Percy manors of Wressle and Burwell, two-thirds of which had each been granted to Cromwell for life in February 1438, together with the reversion of the remainder. This grant was then converted into one in fee simple two years later, further reducing the likelihood of the Percys reclaiming it. Griffiths has calculated Burwell to have been worth an income of &quot;c&quot;. £38 10&quot;s&quot; 6&quot;d&quot; &quot;per annum&quot; in 1456. These manors had been forfeited in 1403 by the first earl of Northumberland after the failure of the Percy Rebellion against Henry IV, and Cromwell&#x27;s holding them in fee-simple meant they were available to him to grant away to whomever he liked.

==Skirmish at Heworth Moor==

This, the first actual confrontation (and &#x27;most serious incident to date&#x27;) between the two families, in response to the marriage of Thomas Neville and Maud, a marriage which Griffiths has said must have been &#x27;obnoxious&#x27; to the Percys, and particularly Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont. This clash, on 24 August 1453, has been described as having the intention of &#x27;the destruction of the entire Neville party&#x27; on the latter&#x27;s way to the Neville stronghold of Sheriff Hutton Castle; it is, says Griffiths &#x27;unclear&#x27; as to whether the Earl of Northumberland was party to Egremont&#x27;s plans. Since only five members of the wedding party are ever named as being present by contemporary chroniclers, it is impossible to assess the strength of their force—Griffiths suggests &#x27;their retinue must have been impressive.&#x27; It has been suggested that the earl of Salisbury was personally targeted for attack by one Sir William Buckton, due to the fact that at the later indictments, his name was individually recorded as being &quot;contra comite Sarum in campo&quot; (&#x27;against the earl of Salisbury in the field&#x27;).

The prospect of Percy manors passing to the Neville family was too much for Lord Egremont, who spent days fiercely recruiting in York and ambushed the Nevilles on their way home to Sheriff Hutton. He no doubt intended to assassinate the Nevilles, but all of the family were there with their own retinues, so they probably had a larger force than Egremont expected (as earls, Salisbury and Warwick were entitled to at least a hundred soldiers each in their retinues).

Still, the Percy force was almost certainly larger in size (though 710 names have been preserved, they probably numbered over a thousand). Mutual fear of fighting a pitched battle meant there was little if any bloodshed, and the Nevilles were able to retreat swiftly to their stronghold in Sheriff Hutton. There is an alternative view; the evidence for this is found on legal rolls and nowhere else. As not a soul is recorded as being injured in the skirmish, it is possible that the Nevilles used this incitement of violence as an excuse, an early example of a legal fiction, to take the matter to the royal courts, resolving the legal case and thereby stating whose land this skirmish took place on. This view has been suggested after studying the Kings Bench lists (now withdrawn from the public), where a number of skirmishes such as this are recorded but the only injuries or casualties found are a hen and occasionally a dog.

==Incidents and chronology==
20 Oct 1453: The leaders of both Neville and Percy forces—Thomas and John Neville for the former, Egremont and Sir Richard Percy for the latter—converged respectively on their castles of Topcliffe and Sand Hutton in the North Riding. Significantly, they were, for the first time, accompanied by their fathers and elder brothers—Salisbury and Richard, Earl of Warwick accompanied John and Thomas, whilst the Percy brothers were with Northumberland and his elder brother Henry, Lord Poynings. However, the result of this near-confrontation appears to be unrecorded, says Griffiths.

Griffiths has suggested that the conflict intensified after Christmas 1453, compared to the first few months.

6 May 1454: Salisbury&#x27;s house in York was broken into and his tenants attacked. Those who took part in this attack had mostly been with Egremont at Heworth. These men were also responsible for the sacking of Skipwith&#x27;s York house a week later.

==Crown intervention==
On 12 July 1453, the king and council announced a commission of Oyer and Terminer, which was headed by the earls of Salisbury and Northumberland themselves. This was however, reformed two weeks later; Griffiths has speculated that this was probably because not only was it not big enough to deal with such a serious collapse in law and order, but also the commissioners themselves &#x27;were not very effective.&#x27; Another weakness of this commission, he suggests, is the fact that it was composed with a number of Neville retainers; thus displaying a clear partisanship which would have been obvious to the Percys, and further reduce their faith in the crown&#x27;s ability—or desire—to achieve a fair settlement.

By 27 July, says Griffiths, the situation in the north had deteriorated so badly that the crown effectively abrogated its authority in the region, by writing directly to the two earls, laying responsibility for ending the dispute on them, and instructing them to keep their sons in order. It was at this point too, that the commission of Oyer and Terminer of 12 July was reissued; this time, without the presence of the earls, and with a much larger number of lawyers, 328 members included. The reissued commission was composed of Sir William Lucy of Northamptonshire, Peter Arden, John Portyngton, and Robert Danby, the latter three being lawyers and the former an uninvolved knight. The commission also expanded geographically into Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, &#x27;and Yorkshire generally,&#x27; as opposed to the narrow remit of just York and environs as had the first one. Griffiths points to the fact that it actually found against at least four of John Neville&#x27;s &#x27;principle accomplices&#x27;- Sir John Conyers, Sir James Pickering, Sir Randolph, and Sir Thomas Mountford.
The crown continued to write to the involved parties. On 8 October 1453, the council wrote to the earl of Westmorland and congratulated him on not assisting the Middleham branch. It also wrote again to Salisbury and Northumberland, &#x27;more in sorrow than in anger,&#x27; as Griffiths has phrased it, exhorting them to remember their positions of Commissioners of the Peace and also as members of the king&#x27;s council. At the same time, Parlt demanded that the nobility resolve their problems peaceably rather than in force. However, the king&#x27;s letters &#x27;concluded wearily&#x27; that both of them kept raising armed forces in spite of the appeals from king and parliament. Similar letters were sent to their involved younger sons using stronger terms, warning them that they could eventually suffer forfeiture. Griffiths has suggested that the crown was constrained in its attempts to suppress the law breaking because by now, the king had become incapacitated, and the council ruling in his stead were ill-able to afford alienating fellow magnates whose support might be required in government.

==Open warfare==
In retaliation, Sir John Neville raided the absent Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s house at Catton, in Yorkshire, and all but ruined it. The next day, Richard Percy attacked a house on Neville property.

The danger of civil war was intensified when both sides began summoning their retainers to strongholds in the north. On 20 October, the Percy clan had gathered 10,000 men at Topcliffe. Only four miles away, the Neville force was stationed at Sheriff Hutton. After several threats from the king, both sides reached a truce and disbanded their men. However, one chronicler said, &quot;There was no reconciliation, the day of reckoning had merely been postponed.&quot;

Despite these precautions, it is probable that a few hundred men clashed at Stamford Bridge on 31 October or 1 November 1454, resulting in hundreds dead and more wounded. Lord Egremont was then captured and imprisoned by John Neville.

==York&#x27;s protectorate==
Michael Hicks has described the roots of the Neville&#x27;s alliance with Richard, Duke of York in 1453 as being based on their having &#x27;common enemies&#x27; (for instance, the king&#x27;s chief minister, Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset) and that this association was significant enough to be &#x27;a coalition of national significance.&#x27;
Griffiths notes that the parliament of 1453 failed to achieve any accord in the north, and that following the mental collapse of the king, York was made protector and Salisbury Chancellor; this, Griffiths suggests, presented Salisbury with an opportunity for revenge- which the earl took. Salisbury was now in an official position to write to Egremont and his father much more threateningly than the council had attempted the previous year. Northumberland was ordered to appear before the council by 12 June 1454, and his sons on 2 June.

==Rebellion of the Duke of Exeter==
During York&#x27;s Protectorate, Somerset was imprisoned, and the Percys suffered greatly at the hands of the Nevilles. When the king recovered from his illness, York was relieved of power, and Somerset was released and was quick to ally himself with the Percys.

Six months later, Henry VI, Somerset and the Percys (the Lancastrians) met the Duke of York and the Nevilles (the Yorkists) in the First Battle of St Albans, where the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Northumberland were slain.

==Battle of Stamford Bridge==

Stamford Bridge, one of the earl of Salisbury&#x27;s manors, was on the old Roman Road east of York. On 31 October 1454 (or, according to some accounts, 1 or 2 November) Egremont, and a short while later Richard Percy were captured by Sir Thomas Neville. Griffith&#x27;s account describes there being hundreds killed and many wounded. It is likely that the Neville victory was made possible by the (to the Percys) treasonous flight of Peter Lound, the bailiff of their Pocklington manor, which was approximately two miles south of Stamford Bridge. The two Percy brothers were taken to Middleham Castle and then transferred to the duke of York&#x27;s custody.

==Aftermath and consequences==

Following their defeat at Stamford Bridge, the Percy brothers were arraigned before a commission of Oyer and Terminer at York. This commission bound them over for massive sums; 8,000 marks payable to Salisbury, and including fines towards his countess and sons, to a total of 16,800 marks; Griffiths describes this as Salisbury&#x27;s &#x27;reckoning&#x27; of all the damage caused to his estates during the course of the feud.
Griffiths has summarised the financial bonds that were intended to hold the peace together. Salisbury entered into a bond with the king for 12,000 marks on behalf of his sons Thomas and John (for being the principal Neville players). Conversely, Northumberland and his mother bound themselves for the same amount, &#x27;for all offences&#x27; against York and the Nevilles. Salisbury also agreed that Lord Egremont was to be released from the 16,800 mark bond he had been punished with in November 1454, and would also desist from taking any action against the Newgate sheriffs responsible for Egremont&#x27;s escape. Egremont himself was then obligated in bond for 4,000 marks. This would have to be paid to Salisbury if he broke the peace towards the earl and his family for the next ten years. As Griffiths put, with these bonds, it was intended that &#x27;the slate was wiped clean.&#x27;

<text>The County of Auxerre was a county in current central France, with its capital in Auxerre. It was commonly associated with the Duchy of Burgundy.
==History==
The first count attested by the sources is one Ermenaud, a companion of Charlemagne who reigned around 770. In 859 Charles the Bald handed over the county to his cousin Conrad II of Burgundy. When he revolted, the county was assigned to Robert the Strong. After the latter&#x27;s death, Hugh the Abbot was count, but named a viscount in his lieu; later Auxerre was absorbed in Richard of Burgundy&#x27;s dominion.

Count John IV sold it to the King of France in 1370. After the Treaty of Arras (1435) between Charles VII of France and Philip III of Burgundy, it returned once again to the latter. In 1477, with the annexion of Burgundy, it became definitively part of France.

No one was able to discover the perpetrator. Yoshitsune was then aged 38 years. The &quot;sadaijin&quot; Konoe Iezane succeeded Yoshitsune as &quot;sesshō;&quot; and the &quot;dainagon&quot; Fujiwara no Tadatsune became &quot;sadaijin.&quot;

<text>Douglas Arthur Wimbish (born September 22, 1956) is an American bassist, primarily known for being a member of rock band Living Colour and funk/dub/hip hop collective Tackhead, and as a session musician with artists such as Sugarhill Gang, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, The Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger, Depeche Mode, James Brown, Annie Lennox, Tarja Turunen, and Barrington Levy (as well as his studio work for the rap/hip hop label Sugarhill Records and the experimental dub label On-U Sound).

==Biography and career==

Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Wimbish started playing guitar at the age of 12 and switched to bass guitar at the age of 14. In 1979 he was hired together with guitarist Skip McDonald and drummer Keith LeBlanc to form the house rhythm section for Sugarhill Records. Although they did not play on the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s famous song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (the rhythm tracks for this song were played by the group Positive Force), they did play on many other popular song tracks, including &quot;The Message&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, &quot;White Lines&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel, &quot;New York City&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and &quot;Apache&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang. 
Together with McDonald and LeBlanc, Wimbish headed to London in 1984 and started working with producer Adrian Sherwood and formed the group Tackhead. Together with Tackhead and as a session bassist, Wimbish found himself in demand as a bass player for many artists and was considered as a permanent sideman for the Rolling Stones after the departure of bassist Bill Wyman in 1993, but lost the position to Darryl Jones. In the late 1980s Wimbish began crossing paths with vocalist Bernard Fowler, who collaborated with Tackhead and Little Axe. Both sang on records by the Rolling Stones, and Wimbish later played on the Stones&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;. Wimbish joined Living Colour in 1992 (he replaced Muzz Skillings, who left the band) to tour and record the album, &quot;Stain&quot;.

Living Colour disbanded in 1995, and Wimbish joined his old Sugarhill Gang partners to play in Little Axe, an ambient-dub project initiated by Skip &#x27;Little Axe&#x27; MacDonald.

After Living Colour disbanded, Wimbish went back to London to continue his career as a studio bassist. In 1999 he formed the drum and bass group Jungle Funk together with drummer Will Calhoun and percussionist/vocalist Vinx. Also in 1999, Wimbish solo album &quot;Trippy Notes for Bass&quot; was released. In 2000, Living Colour was re-formed and toured in the United States, South America and Europe. In 2001 and 2002 Wimbish recorded and played with rapper Mos Def in a band called BlackJack Johnson, which also featured members of P-Funk and Bad Brains in the lineup.

Wimbish also formed Head Fake, a drum and bass project with drummer Will Calhoun. They released a CD, &quot;In The Area&quot;. In 2005 they started recording new songs. The recording took place in Brussels, Belgium and was followed by an extensive European tour. The CD has never been released. A Head»Fake DVD was released in 2008. It features a recording of a Head»Fake concert in Prague.

In 2008 Wimbish, signed with Enja Records, and released his second solo album, &quot;CinemaSonics&quot;.

In 2009, Living Colour released and toured for the album &quot;The Chair in the Doorway&quot;.

Wimbish was also featured on six Little Axe albums with Alan Glen on harmonica.

==Gear==
Wimbish has endorsed Ibanez and Spector bass guitars.

<doc id="1120255" wikidata="Q577606" url="?curid=1120255" title="Chief Dan George">
<text>Chief Dan George (born Geswanouth Slahoot; July 24, 1899 – September 23, 1981) was a chief of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, a Coast Salish band whose Indian reserve is located on Burrard Inlet in the southeast area of the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He also was an actor, musician, poet and author. The Chief&#x27;s best-known written work is &quot;My Heart Soars&quot;. As an actor, he is best remembered for portraying Old Lodge Skins opposite Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and for his role in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976), as Lone Watie, opposite Clint Eastwood.

==Early years==
Born as Geswanouth Slahoot in North Vancouver, his English name was originally Dan Slaholt. The surname was changed to George when he entered a residential school at age 5. He worked at a number of different jobs, including as a longshoreman, construction worker, and school bus driver, and was band chief of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation from 1951 to 1963 (then called the Burrard Indian Band).

==Acting career==

=== 1960–1970: Early roles and breakthrough ===
In 1960, when he was already 60 years old, he landed his first acting job in a CBC Television series, &quot;Cariboo Country&quot;, as the character Ol&#x27; Antoine (pron. &quot;Antwine&quot;). He performed the same role in a Walt Disney Studios film&quot; Smith!&quot; (1969), adapted from an episode in the series &quot;The High Chaparral&quot; (the episode in turn being based on &quot;Breaking Smith&#x27;s Quarter Horse&quot;, a novella by Paul St. Pierre). 

In 1970, at age 71, he received several honours for his role in Arthur Penn&#x27;s film &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

=== 1971–1981: Subsequent success ===
In 1971 He played Chief Red Cloud in Season 13 Episode 14 (Warbonnet) on the Western series Bonanza.
He played the role of Rita Joe&#x27;s father in George Ryga&#x27;s stage play, &quot;The Ecstasy of Rita Joe&quot;, in performances at Vancouver, the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, and Washington, D.C.

In 1972, he was among the guests in David Winters&#x27;s television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;. That same year he acted in the film Paul Bogart&#x27;s &quot;Cancel My Reservation,&quot; and got the recurring role of Chief Moses Charlie in the comedy-drama television series &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, a role he would revisit until his death in 1981.

In 1973, he played the role of &quot;Ancient Warrior&quot; in an episode of the TV show &quot;Kung Fu.&quot; That same year George recorded &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; with the band Fireweed, with &quot;Indian Prayer&quot; on the reverse. His album, &quot;Chief Dan George &amp; Fireweed – In Circle&quot;, was released in 1974 comprising these songs and seven others.

The following year he had roles in &quot;Alien Thunder&quot; (1974), &quot;The Bears and I&quot; (1974), and &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974). 

In 1975, he portrayed the character Chief Stillwater in the &quot;Showdown at Times Square&quot; episode in Season 6 of &quot;McCloud&quot;.

In 1976 he acted in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&quot; and George McCowan&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of the Hawk.&quot;

On television the following year he had a role in the 1978 miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;, based on the book by James A. Michener.

In 1979, he acted in &quot;Americathon,&quot; and &quot;Spirit of the Wind&quot;.

In 1980 he had his final film role in &quot;Nothing Personal.&quot;

=== 1984: Posthumous written work ===
George was well known for his poetic writing style and in 1974, George wrote &quot;My Heart Soars&quot; followed by &quot;My Spirit Soars&quot; in 1983, both published by Hancock House Publishers. The two books were later combined to form &quot;The Best of Chief Dan George&quot; which went on to become a best seller and continues to sell well today. One of his better known pieces of poetry &quot;A Lament for Confederation&quot; has become one of his most widely known works.

== Death ==
The Chief died at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver in 1981 at the age of 82. He was interred at Burrard Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Dan George&#x27;s granddaughter Lee Maracle was a poet, author, activist, and professor. His granddaughter Charlene Aleck is an actress who performed for 18 years on &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; on CBC. His granddaughter Joan Phillip is the BC NDP MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. His great-granddaughter Columpa Bobb is an actress and poet.

Chief Dan George&#x27;s grand-nephew, Chief Jesse &quot;Nighthawk&quot; George, currently resides in Chesapeake, Virginia, and is the Inter-Tribal Peace Chief for the Commonwealth of Virginia.

== Activism ==
During his acting career, he worked to promote better understanding by non-aboriginals of the First Nations people. His soliloquy, &quot;Lament for Confederation&quot;, an indictment of the appropriation of native territory by European colonialism, was performed at the City of Vancouver&#x27;s celebration of the Canadian centennial in 1967. This speech is credited with escalating native political activism in Canada and touching off widespread pro-native sentiment among non-natives.

==Accolades==
Chief Dan George received the following accolades for &quot;Little Big Man&quot;.
==Honours and legacy==

In 1971, George was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

He was included on the Golden Rule Poster under &quot;Native Spirituality&quot; with the quote: &quot;We are as much alive as we keep the earth alive&quot;.

Canadian actor Donald Sutherland narrated the following quote from his poem &quot;My Heart Soars&quot; in the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

:&quot;The beauty of the trees,&quot;
:&quot;the softness of the air,&quot;
:&quot;the fragrance of the grass,&quot;
:&quot;speaks to me.&quot;
:&quot;And my heart soars.&quot;

<text>Otto James Messmer (; August 16, 1892 – October 28, 1983) was an American animator known for his work on the Felix the Cat cartoons and comic strip produced by the Pat Sullivan studio.

The extent of Messmer&#x27;s role in the creation and popularity of Felix is a matter of ongoing dispute, particularly as he only laid his claim to the character after the death of Sullivan, who until that time had received the credit.

== Early life ==
Messmer was born on August 16, 1892, to a German Catholic family in West Hoboken, New Jersey (now Union City). He attended Holy Family Parochial School. He had a love of vaudeville and the entertainment industry instilled in him by his parents and teachers which began at a young age. He attended the Thomas School of Art in New York City from 1911–1913, and participated in a work-study program with the Acme Agency, where he did illustrations for fashion catalogs.

== Career ==
Messmer&#x27;s first love, however, was cartooning. Inspired by Winsor McCay&#x27;s animated films, such as &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot;, Messmer began creating his comics for local newspapers in 1912, the same year he met Anne Mason, whom he married in 1934. One of his comics, &quot;Fun&quot;, ran as part of the Sunday comics&#x27; page for &quot;New York World&quot;.

Messmer signed a deal with Universal Studios in 1915 to produce a test film of a character Messmer created called &quot;Motor Mat&quot;. It was never released, but drew the interest of animator Pat Sullivan, though Messmer instead decided to go to work with Henry &quot;Hy&quot; Mayer, a well-known cartoonist. Mayer and Messmer collaborated on the successful animated series &quot;The Travels of Teddy&quot;, which was based on the life of Teddy Roosevelt. Messmer would subsequently work for Sullivan, who handled the business side of the work, with Messmer handling creative responsibilities. When Sullivan served a nine-month prison sentence in 1917, Messmer briefly returned to work with Mayer, until Messmer was drafted into World War I.
When Messmer returned to the United States in 1919, he returned to Sullivan&#x27;s studio, which was hired by director Earl Hurd of &quot;Paramount Screen Magazine&quot; for a cartoon short that would accompany a feature film. Sullivan gave the project to Messmer, whose end result, &quot;Feline Follies&quot;, starred Master Tom, a black cat, who was a prototype to Felix, which brought good luck to people in trouble.

Sullivan&#x27;s involvement in the project is disputed. However, handwriting in the animation has been identified as his. In addition to Sullivan&#x27;s handwriting in &#x27;Feline Follies&#x27;, the Australian term for mother &#x27;MUM&#x27; is used in a speech bubble of one of the kittens at the 4:00 mark of &#x27;Feline Follies&#x27;.

Felix was the first cartoon character created and developed for the screen, as well as the first to become a licensed, mass merchandised character. Both his design and his unique character were highly influential. Sullivan took the credit for Felix, and though Messmer directed and was the lead animator on all of the episodes he appeared in, Sullivan&#x27;s name was the only onscreen credit that appeared in them. Messmer also oversaw the direction of the Felix newspaper strip, doing most of the pencils and inks on the strip until 1954.

Felix the Cat starred in over 150 cartoons until 1931, when animation studios began converting to sound films. The newspaper strip&#x27;s popularity began to fade in the late 1930s, though the character was reintroduced to new fans via comic books in the 1940s. Messmer then teamed with Douglas Leigh on the large moving electronic signs that lit up Times Square.

Messmer also produced more &quot;Felix&quot; comic books in the 1940s and 1950s for companies such as Dell Comics, Toby Press, and Harvey Comics, as well as doing animation for Famous Studios (Several Popeye cartoons carry his credit). By the 1960s, Felix had been reinvented for television, and Messmer&#x27;s longtime assistant Joe Oriolo (the creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost) made sure that Messmer was finally credited as the creator of Felix the Cat. Messmer continued working on the character for the rest of his life.

== Death and legacy ==
Messmer died from a heart attack at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey on October 28, 1983. He was 91 years old. Today, Felix the Cat is run in syndication in over 250 newspapers all over the world.

<doc id="1120262" wikidata="Q883764" url="?curid=1120262" title="Shutter priority">
<text>Shutter priority (usually denoted as S on the mode dial), also called time value (abbreviated as Tv), refers to a setting on cameras that allows the user to choose a specific shutter speed while the camera adjusts the aperture to ensure correct exposure. This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, aperture priority where the user picks an aperture with the camera selecting the shutter speed to match, or program mode where the camera selects both.

==Background==
Shutter priority with longer exposures is chosen to create an impression of motion. For example, a waterfall will appear blurred and fuzzy. If the camera is panned with a moving subject, the background will appear blurred. When photographing sports or high-speed phenomena, shutter priority with short exposures can ensure that the motion is effectively &quot;frozen&quot; in the resulting image.

Like aperture priority, this mode allows for partial automation thus decreasing the need for total concentration.

Shutter priority is often abbreviated as &quot;S&quot; (with Nikon, Minolta, Konica Minolta, Sony, Olympus, Sigma, Panasonic) or &quot;Tv&quot; (for &quot;time value&quot; with Canon, Pentax, Leica) on a camera mode dial.

<text>The Summers memo was a 1991 memo on trade liberalization that was written by Lant Pritchett and signed by Lawrence Summers who was then Chief Economist of the World Bank. It included a section that both Summers and Pritchett say was sarcastic that suggested dumping toxic waste in third-world countries for perceived economic benefits.

After the material was leaked by Roberto Smeraldi of Friends of the Earth to &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; on February 2, 1992. Pritchett (who worked under Summers) stated that he had written the memo and Summers had only signed it, and that it was intended to be &quot;sarcastic&quot;. According to Pritchett, the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony, and was &quot;a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit Larry and the World Bank&quot;.

Daniel Hausman and Michael McPherson have argued that the satirical section might seem to be based in economics as a science, but in fact contains strong moral premises which cannot be removed and still leave the argument intact. Brazil&#x27;s environment secretary Jose Lutzenberger argued that it demonstrated &quot;the arrogant ignorance of many conventional &#x27;economists&#x27; concerning the nature of the world we live in&quot;.

==Coverage==
Extensive news articles and discussion regarding this memo were included in the US Senate hearing records for Summers&#x27; nomination to Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 1993. In this hearing, Summers stated:

<doc id="1120275" wikidata="Q5262544" url="?curid=1120275" title="Derf Scratch">
<text>Frederick Charles Milner III (October 30, 1951 – July 28, 2010), better known by his stage name Derf Scratch, was an American musician, best known as a former member of the punk rock band Fear and its original bass guitarist.

==Career==
Scratch played bass for Fear since the band&#x27;s formation in 1977. Scratch met John Belushi during this time in Los Angeles. Belushi loved Fear and was their biggest booster; the two became good friends and abused cocaine together; this period of their lives is well documented in the Bob Woodward book &quot;Wired: The Short Life And Fast Times Of John Belushi,&quot; a biography of the comedy actor.

Belushi got Fear a guest appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that essentially ended in a semi-planned melee. 

After their &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance, they recorded their debut album &quot;The Record,&quot; now a classic punk album. &quot;The Record&quot; was the first of its kind and sets itself apart from other punk recordings of that era, in that the production value was incredibly high for this type of recording. The album was recorded and engineered at the same studio that Fleetwood Mac was recording at and was given the same attention and technical talent that was given to this major super group. Scratch not only played bass on most of the record, he played saxophone on the song &quot;New York&#x27;s Alright If You Like Saxophones&quot; (while lead singer Lee Ving played bass, as they had been doing the song live). Scratch also co-wrote one song with Ving on the album, &quot;Fresh Flesh&quot;, and wrote and sang lead vocal on another, &quot;Getting The Brush&quot; which was about his struggle to get his songs put on the album. Derf claimed that Lee would use up all the record space with his songs as 70% of the publishing and royalty proceeds went to the writer of the song, leaving only 30% to split with the rest of the band members. Scratch was also seen with the band in the movie &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; and on an episode of Casey Kasem&#x27;s syndicated &quot;America&#x27;s Top 10&quot; TV show where his band took first place receiving a &quot;Gong&quot; trophy.

Fear hung on until the mid-1980s, eventually breaking up due to the death of the Hollywood punk scene and Ving&#x27;s increasing interest in acting and performing country music. Lee&#x27;s unwillingness to share the publishing rights by allowing other members to contribute their songs on any recordings was also a huge source of dissent among the band members. During the punk revival generated by Nirvana in the 1990s, vocalist Lee Ving did one final performance with the original lineup of Fear before putting together a new version of Fear containing no original members other than himself. Lee instead decided to use unknown &quot;hired guns&quot; to perform and record with Fear in order to maintain all the publishing rights and keep the royalties.

Scratch, wishing to concentrate on guitar and saxophone, sold the Fender bass he used on &quot;The Record&quot; to then-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt. Watt played the instrument on another future punk classic, the 1982 release &quot;What Makes A Man Start Fires?&quot; His surviving instruments and the saxophone used on the New York&#x27;s Alright&quot; recording are now in possession of his wife Tammy.

Scratch later resurfaced in several other groups, including groups such as the eponymous Scratch which released a record in Belgium with very limited sales and included the song &quot;About Me&quot; https://myspace.com/derfscratch a fine example of Derf&#x27;s clever song writing, Derf Scratch and Friends, and The Werewolfs (which also featured Butch Patrick who played as the son in the TV show The Munsters). As a member of The Werewolfs, Scratch was seriously injured in a car accident after a show in Los Angeles.

During the last 5 years of Derf&#x27;s life he developed an interest in art, he began painting in 1994 alongside of his wife Tammy who was an artist creating original jewelry pieces that she sold under the name Rita Blackwood. Derf produced a series of &quot;Legs&quot; works which he was planning to exhibit, he continued painting up until his death, his wife Tammy is in possession of these works.

==Death==
Scratch died on July 28, 2010, from liver disease. He was 58 years old. He is survived by his wife of fourteen years, Tammy.

==Personal life==
The nickname Derf was actually given to him by his parents when he was a child, it is simply Fred spelled backwards, he carried the name practically all his life.

Derf was ostracized from the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast as it was suspected that he contributed to John Belushi&#x27;s death by giving him his first taste of heroin. To make matters worse Derf did an interview with Bob Woodward for the book &quot;Wired&quot; in which he exposed a lot of the rampant drug use in John&#x27;s circle of friends. On the night John Belushi died, Derf claimed he was looking for John who was late for a Blues Brother&#x27;s rehearsal which Derf 
was to attend for the first time as the new bass player.

Scratch met his wife Tammy in 1992 who at the time called herself &quot;Rita Blackwood&quot;. They married in 1996. She was a member of Derf Scratch and Friends who played keyboards and sang vocals.

Scratch was a real estate agent who had passed his test during his early days with Fear. He shared a desk with his parents at the realtor and would tell them he was going to look for properties, but would go to Lee Ving&#x27;s place to brainstorm ideas for the band.

<text>Saterland (; Saterland Frisian: , ) is a municipality in the district of Cloppenburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated between the cities of Leer, Cloppenburg, and Oldenburg. It is home to Saterland Frisians, who speak Frisian in addition to German and Low German.

The municipality of Saterland was formed in 1974, when the smaller municipalities Strücklingen (&quot;Strukelje&quot; in Saterland Frisian), Ramsloh (&quot;Roomelse&quot;), Sedelsberg (&quot;Seeidelsbierich&quot;) and Scharrel (&quot;Schäddel&quot;) were merged.
== History ==
In medieval times, the Saterland was a sandy region occupying an area of about 15 km long by 1–4 km wide surrounded by marshes. It was settled between the 10th and 13th centuries by Frisians from East Frisia. Being relatively isolated, the inhabitants developed their own form of the East Frisian language, Saterland Frisian, which survives to this day. The &quot;&quot;Saterfriesen&quot;,&quot; as the speakers of this language are called in German, are the smallest minority recognized by the federal government.

== Notable places ==
On the area of the municipality of Saterland is the VLF transmitter DHO38, a large VLF transmitter of the German Navy for sending commands to submarines.

<text>The first USS &quot;Haraden&quot; (DD–183) was a in the United States Navy in the period following World War I. She was later transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Columbia&quot;, as a .

== Construction and career ==

===United States Navy===
Named for Jonathan Haraden, she was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Miss Mabel B. Stephens, great-niece of Captain Jonathan Haraden. &quot;Haraden&quot; was commissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard on 7 June 1919.

&quot;Haraden&quot; was assigned to U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters; after calling at Newport, Rhode Island for supplies she departed New York 30 June 1919 for duty in the Adriatic Sea. She arrived at Split, (then Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, now Croatia), on 28 July 1919 and conducted operations from that port assisting the naval force in the execution of the terms of the Austrian armistice, serving as station ship at Trieste and Rijeka, and participating in maneuvers. This duty occupied her until 23 October 1919, when she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 18 November.

The destroyer departed Norfolk on 7 April 1920 for Charleston, South Carolina, and operated with reserve destroyer divisions out of Charleston until 15 March 1921. After an extensive overhaul at New York, ending on 2 May, &quot;Haraden&quot; sailed for Newport and training operations off New England. She returned to Charleston on 12 October 1921 and to Philadelphia on 10 April 1922. &quot;Haraden&quot; decommissioned 17 July 1922.

With the mounting tensions in 1939, &quot;Haraden&quot; was called back to active service and recommissioned at Philadelphia 4 December 1939. After shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the destroyer performed neutrality patrol in Cuban waters briefly and then returned to Newport, 6 March 1940. She subsequently conducted neutrality patrol in waters off Block Island and Nantucket Shoals, and made three training cruises in Chesapeake Bay.

Arriving Boston Navy Yard 7 September 1940, &quot;Haraden&quot; was one of the fifty over-age destroyers to be sent to the United Kingdom in exchange for bases. She sailed on 18 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia, and decommissioned there for transfer to the British on 24 September 1940. Her name was struck from the Navy List 8 January 1941.

===Royal Canadian Navy===
Assigned to Canada and renamed HMCS &quot;Columbia&quot; following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), after the Columbia River originating in British Columbia and flowing into Washington and thence along the Oregon border. &quot;Columbia&quot; first underwent refit and then was assigned to convoy duties in the Atlantic. Her first major action began 15 October 1941 when she joined convoy SC 48, already under submarine attack. &quot;Columbia&quot;, and the other escorts fought valiantly, but nine merchantmen from the convoy were sunk before reaching England. After the U.S.&#x27;s entry into the war &quot;Columbia&quot; was reassigned to convoy ships from New York to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, the first leg of the transatlantic journey. She escorted convoys and performed anti-submarine patrol until 25 February 1944, when she struck a cliff in foul weather off the coast of Newfoundland. &quot;Columbia&quot; was not fully repaired after the accident but made watertight and used as a fuel and ammunition hulk in Nova Scotia until her return to the War Assets Administration for disposal in August 1945 when she was sold for scrapping.

<text>São Mateus is a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo. Its population was estimated at 132,642 in 2020, and its area is 2,346 km². São Mateus is located at 36 meters above sea level.

==History==
It is the second oldest and seventh most populous municipality in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. São Mateus was founded on 21 of September 1544, receiving municipal autonomy only in 1764. Originally, it was called Povoado do Cricaré, being renamed in the year 1566 by Father José de Anchieta after Saint Matthew.

Until the second-half of 19th century, it was one of the main gateways of enslaved Africans in Brazil. The large influx of slaves arriving at the Americas by the São Mateus&#x27; port explains why today the municipality is considered to have the biggest Afro-descendant population of the state. There were also italian immigrants arriving at the area, these ones being responsible for colonizing part of the backcountry of the municipality.

<text>In photography, stopping down refers to increasing the numerical f-stop number (for example, going from 2 to 4), which decreases the size (diameter) of the aperture of a lens, resulting in reducing the amount of light entering the iris of a lens.

Reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field of the image. In the case of film cameras, this allows less light to reach the film plane – to achieve the same exposure after stopping down, it is necessary to compensate for the reduced light by either increasing the exposure time, or using a photographic film with a higher film speed (ISO). In the case of digital cameras, stopping down the aperture allows less light to reach the image sensor – to achieve the same exposure, it is necessary to compensate for the reduced light by either increasing the exposure time, or increasing the signal gain of the sensor by increasing the camera&#x27;s ISO setting. Alternatively, more light can be added to the scene by increasing the amount of light illuminating the scene, such as by using or increasing the strength of electronic flash or other light sources.

As a lens is stopped down from its maximum (widest) aperture, most lens aberrations (spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism) are decreased, but lens diffraction increases. The effect is that for most lenses, the balance between the decreasing aberrations and the increasing diffraction effects of stopping down the lens means that lenses have an optimum aperture for best results, often about three stops closed down from maximum aperture, so for a lens with a maximum aperture of ƒ/2.8, ƒ/8 would be the optimum aperture.

==Early life==
Greig was born in Maidstone, Kent, the second of three sisters. Her father, Eric (1906–1998), worked as a colour chemist creating dyes, and her mother, Ann (1933–2001), was enthusiastic about amateur dramatics. There was a 27-year age gap between her parents, with her father being 60 years old when Greig was born. The family moved to Kilburn when she was three.

She went to Malorees Junior School, followed by Camden School for Girls later graduating with a first-class BA in Drama and Theatre Arts from the University of Birmingham in 1988. After graduating, she worked at the Family Planning Association and continued doing temporary work until 1996. She also spent some time at a secretarial college.

==Career==
===Radio===
Greig has had a long-running part as Debbie Aldridge in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; since 1991. As her other work increased, her appearances in the show decreased and her character Debbie spends most of her time living in Hungary.

Her other radio work includes narrating the Radio 4 comedy &quot;Warhorses of Letters&quot;, and guest-starring in five episodes of the second series of the radio version of &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, playing Charles Prentiss&#x27;s former lover Gayle Shand, who now runs a rival firm.

===Television===
Greig appeared in a number of supporting parts, notably as Lamia in &quot;Neverwhere&quot; (1996) and The Mother in an episode of &quot;People Like Us&quot; (2000). Her first major role was Fran Katzenjammer in the sitcom &quot;Black Books&quot;, which ran for three series from 2000. Fran was a friend of the main character, Bernard, and originally owned a gift shop called &quot;Nifty Gifty&quot; next door to his bookshop.

In 2004, she played constantly embarrassed surgical registrar Dr Caroline Todd, the lead character in the Channel 4 comedy drama series &quot;Green Wing&quot;. Her performance won her &quot;Best Comedy Performance&quot; in the 2005 Royal Television Society Awards. She also appeared as Caroline in an appearance at &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

She starred in the BBC comedy drama series &quot;Love Soup&quot; (2005), as Alice Chenery, a lovelorn woman working on a department store perfume counter, in a role specifically written for her by David Renwick, whom she met in 2003 when she appeared in an episode of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. In May 2005 she also appeared as a nurse in an episode of the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, entitled &quot;The Long Game&quot;.

Greig appeared in the role of Edith Frank in the BBC&#x27;s January 2009 production of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. Also in 2009, she appeared as Miss Bates in the BBC serial &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Emma&quot;. In 2010, she played Sacharissa Cripslock in the two part mini-series &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Going Postal&quot;.

In 2011, she starred in the BBC/Showtime sitcom &quot;Episodes&quot;, alongside Matt LeBlanc and &quot;Green Wing&quot; co-star Stephen Mangan. Greig and Mangan play a husband-and-wife writing duo who travel to America to work on an adaptation of their successful series. Greig also stars in the Channel 4 sitcom, &quot;Friday Night Dinner&quot;, as Jackie Goodman, the mother of a North London Jewish family.

She played Beth in the 2012 BBC series &quot;White Heat&quot;.
She is also the lead in &quot;The Guilty&quot; in the three-part series on ITV in 2013, playing DCI Maggie Brand who investigates the death of a young child who went missing five years previously.
 In 2014, she played Sally in the &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &quot;Last Gasp&quot;.

In 2015 the fourth season of &quot;Episodes&quot; was aired, and in 2016 a seven-episode fifth season, still starring Greig alongside Stephen Mangan and Matt LeBlanc, was filmed in London.

Greig narrated the sixth series of &quot;The Secret Life of the Zoo&quot;, taking over from Olivia Colman, in 2018.

Greig has received three BAFTA nominations for her TV work. She was nominated for Best Comedy Performance for &quot;Green Wing&quot; in 2005, and for Best Female Comedy Performance for &quot;Friday Night Dinner&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Episodes&quot; in 2015.

===Theatre===
During 2006 and early 2007, Greig played Beatrice in a much acclaimed production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; for which she won a Laurence Olivier Award, and Constance in &quot;King John&quot;, as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Works&quot; season. Whilst the win itself was a surprise, her acceptance speech was received very well as being highly entertaining, claiming that she was so excited that she had wet her dress. The speech was apparently completely improvised. Backstage, when told not to tell her mother about her wetting her dress, she told the host that her mum was dead before dedicating her award to her &quot;dead mum&quot;. She also won the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for &quot;Best Shakespearean Performance&quot; in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, becoming the first woman to win the award, and was nominated for &quot;The FRANCO&#x27;S Best Actress in a Play&quot; in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Awards.

At the Gielgud Theatre in March 2008, she co-starred with Ralph Fiennes, Janet McTeer and Ken Stott in the UK premiere of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;The God of Carnage&quot; (&quot;Le Dieu du carnage&quot;) translated by Christopher Hampton and directed by Matthew Warchus. The play won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy in 2009. In 2008, she co-starred in the surreal sci-fi film &quot;Captain Eager and the Mark of Voth&quot;.

In November 2008, she made her National Theatre debut in &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, a new play by David Hare which toured the UK.
Greig starred in &quot;The Little Dog Laughed&quot; by Douglas Carter Beane at the Garrick Theatre in London, which ran a limited season until 10 April 2010. She starred alongside Rupert Friend, Gemma Arterton and Harry Lloyd, and the play was directed by Jamie Lloyd. She won the 2011 WhatsOnStage Theatregoers Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress in a play for her portrayal. Her performance as Diane in &quot;The Little Dog Laughed&quot; garnered her a second Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress. In October 2011 she was Hilary, the central character, in &quot;Jumpy&quot; at the Royal Court, London., which later transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in the West End. In March 2013 she played Varia in &quot;Longing&quot;, a new play by William Boyd based on two short stories by Chekov, at the Hampstead Theatre. Greig previously performed in &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre, London, until May 2015. In March 2015, she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

In October 2016, she returned to the Hampstead Theatre to play Empty in &quot;The Intelligent Homosexual&#x27;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures&quot; by Tony Kushner. In February 2017 she returned to the Royal National Theatre to play Malvolia in a new production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Olivier Theatre. As a Labour constituency agent spanning a period of 27 years, she gave a &quot;polished ... magnificent&quot; performance in James Graham &quot;Labour of Love&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre, London, in October 2017.

===Film===
Greig made a cameo appearance in the 2004 comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. She starred with Richard E. Grant in the 2009 film &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, and with Roger Allam and Gemma Arterton in &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot; (2010). The latter role earned Greig a British Independent Film Awards nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She co-starred in 2015&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; and in the 2016 release of &quot;Breaking the Bank&quot;, opposite Kelsey Grammer.

==Personal life==
 Greig lived in a flat in Kensal Green, having moved back to the area in 1996 to be with her dying father. She became a Christian at this time, despite being brought up as an atheist. Greig is also a vegetarian.

Since 1997 she has been married to actor Richard Leaf, whom she met at a wrap party of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 1996 miniseries &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, and has three children.

She is a supporter of the National Health Service, giving her backing to a rally organised by pro-NHS protest group NHS Together. She also supports more practical teaching of Shakespeare in British schools, supporting the RSC&#x27;s &quot;Stand Up For Shakespeare&quot; manifesto. Greig was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to the 2014 referendum on that issue.

<text>Luiz Floriano Bonfá (17 October 1922 – 12 January 2001) was a Brazilian guitarist and composer. He was best known for the music he composed for the film &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;.

==Biography==
Luiz Floriano Bonfá was born on October 17, 1922, in Rio de Janeiro. He began studying with Uruguayan classical guitarist Isaías Sávio at the age of 11. These weekly lessons entailed a long, harsh commute (on foot, plus two and half hours on train) from his family home in Santa Cruz, in the western rural outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to the teacher&#x27;s home in the hills of Santa Teresa. Given Bonfá&#x27;s extraordinary dedication and talent for the guitar, Sávio excused the youngster&#x27;s inability to pay for his lessons.

Bonfá first gained widespread exposure in Brazil in 1947 when he was featured on Rio&#x27;s Rádio Nacional, then an important showcase for up-and-coming talent. He was a member of the vocal group Quitandinha Serenaders in the late 1940s. Some of his first compositions such as &quot;Ranchinho de Palha&quot;, &quot;O Vento Não Sabe&quot;, were recorded and performed by Brazilian crooner Dick Farney in the 1950s. Bonfá&#x27;s first hit song was &quot;De Cigarro em Cigarro&quot; recorded by Nora Ney in 1957. It was through Farney that Bonfá was introduced to Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, the leading songwriting team behind the worldwide explosion of Bossa Nova in the late 1950s to 1970s, becoming a fever in the US. Bonfá collaborated with them and with other prominent Brazilian musicians and artists in productions of de Moraes&#x27; anthological play &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot;, which several years later gave origin to Marcel Camus&#x27; film &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; (&quot;Orfeu Negro&quot; in Portuguese). In the burgeoning days of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s jazz scene, it was commonplace for musicians, artists, and dramatists to collaborate in such theatrical presentations. Bonfá wrote some of the original music featured in the film, including the numbers &quot;Samba de Orfeu&quot; and his most famous composition, &quot;Manhã de Carnaval&quot; (of which Carl Sigman later wrote a different set of English lyrics titled &quot;A Day in the Life of a Fool&quot;), which has been among the top ten standards played worldwide, according to &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

As a composer and performer, Bonfá was an exponent of the bold, lyrical, lushly orchestrated, and emotionally charged &quot;samba-canção&quot; style that predated the arrival of João Gilberto&#x27;s more refined and subdued bossa nova style. Jobim, João Donato, Dorival Caymmi, and other contemporaries were also essentially &quot;samba-canção&quot; musicians until the sudden, massive popularity of the young Gilberto&#x27;s unique style of guitar playing and expressively muted vocals transformed the genre. Camus&#x27; film and Gilberto&#x27;s and Jobim&#x27;s collaborations with American jazz musicians such as Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd did much to bring international recognition to Brazilian popular music, and Bonfá became a highly visible ambassador of Brazilian music in the United States beginning with the famous November 1962 Bossa Nova concert at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

Bonfá worked with American musicians such as Quincy Jones, George Benson, Stan Getz, and Frank Sinatra, recording several albums while in U.S. Elvis Presley sang a Bonfá composition, &quot;Almost in Love&quot; with lyrics by Randy Starr in the 1968 MGM film &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot;. Also of note is his &quot;The Gentle Rain&quot;, with lyrics by Matt Dubey, &quot;Non-Stop To Brazil&quot; (recorded by Astrud Gilberto) and &quot;Sambolero&quot;. From 1990 to 1999, Bonfá worked with singer Ithamara Koorax on several recordings and concerts, appearing live with her as special guest at several venues in Rio de Janeiro such as Teatro Rival, BNDES Auditorium and Funarte-Sidney Miller Hall. They also recorded together, in 1996, the album Almost In Love - Ithamara Koorax Sings The Luiz Bonfá Songbook, featuring Bonfá on acoustic guitar plus special guests Larry Coryell, Eumir Deodato, Ron Carter, Marcos Suzano, and Sadao Watanabe. The sessions, produced by Arnaldo DeSouteiro, were filmed for a Japanese TV broadcast presented by Sadao Watanabe.

Bonfá wrote soundtracks for two dozens of movies, such as &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, &quot; O Santo Módico&quot;, &quot;Os Cafajestes&quot;, &quot;The Gentle Rain&quot;, &quot;Pour Un Amour Lointain&quot;, &quot;Le Ore dell&#x27;Amore&quot;, &quot;Carnival Of Crime&quot; and &quot;Prisoner Of Rio&quot; (on which he collaborated with arranger Hans Zimmer), among many others. He died of prostate cancer at 78 in Rio de Janeiro on January 12, 2001. At the time of his death, he was working in the soundtracks for a movie produced and starred by Karen Black and for a Broadway show titled &quot;Brazilian Bombshell&quot; based in the life of Carmen Miranda and to be starred by Sonia Braga.

==Legacy==
In 2005, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings released an album of Bonfá&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;Solo in Rio 1959&quot;, which included previously unreleased material from the original recording session.

In 2008, Universal Music France released a coffee table book containing two CDs which included previously unreleased material of the &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; soundtrack, and a DVD. Also in 2008, Universal Music released &quot;The Brazilian Scene&quot;, &quot;Braziliana&quot; and &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; celebrating the 50th anniversary of the bossa nova.

Bonfá&#x27;s major legacy continues to be his compositions from the &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; soundtrack, most notably the instantly recognizable bossa nova classic &quot;Manhã de Carnaval&quot;. Bonfá&#x27;s discography also attests to his inventive mastery of Brazilian jazz guitar. Bonfá&#x27;s guitar style was brassier and more penetrating than that of his major contemporary, João Gilberto, and Bonfá was a frequent and adept soloist whereas Gilberto plays his own suave, intricate brand of rhythm guitar almost exclusively. Bonfá often played solo guitar in a polyphonic style, harmonizing melody lines in a manner similar to that made famous by Wes Montgomery in the US, or playing lead and rhythm parts simultaneously. As a composer and as a guitarist, Bonfá played a pivotal role in bridging the incumbent &quot;samba-canção&quot; style with the innovations of the bossa nova movement.

Bonfá&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Seville&quot; from his 1967 LP &quot;Luiz Bonfa Plays Great Songs&quot; is the basis for the 2011 hit &quot;Somebody That I Used to Know&quot; by Belgian-Australian musician Gotye. Gotye&#x27;s song charted number one in 27 countries.

Many other Bonfá&#x27;s songs have been heavily sampled by MCs, rappers and DJs of the hip-hop generation. &quot;Bonfá Nova&quot; was sampled by Brazilian rapper Marcelo D2 on the hit song &quot;À Procura da Batida Perfeita,&quot; &quot;Jacarandá&quot; was sampled by the group Planet Hemp on &quot;Se Liga&quot;, &quot;Bahia Soul&quot; was sampled by the British band Smoke City on their biggest hit &quot;Underwater Love&quot;. &quot;Saudade Vem Correndo&quot; became the hip-hero anthem &quot;Runnin&#x27;&quot; recorded by The Pharcyde. In 2021, JPEGMAFIA sampled different parts of the same song in &quot;DIKEMBE!&quot;, which was included in the offline version of his &quot;LP!&quot; album and afterwards released in streaming services in his EP &quot;OFFLINE!&quot;. Japanese DJ Nujabes ヌジャベス also sampled &quot;Shade of the Mango Tree&quot; (from 1980&#x27;s &quot;Bonfa Burrows Brazil&quot;) in his track &quot;Lady Brown&quot; on the album &quot;Metaphorical Music&quot; in 2004.

== Science ==
The lignite (brown coal) deposits in the region are former Miocene swamp forest dominated by &quot;Castanopsis&quot;, a type of chinkapin. Such plants do not occur naturally in Europe. A type of fossil wood has been described from logs found in Eschweiler mines. It was named &quot;Castanoxylon eschweilerense&quot; in reference to the town; the name would translate as &quot;Eschweiler chinkapin wood&quot;, as it probably belonged to &quot;Castanopsis&quot; but perhaps to some other genus of chinkapin.

== Transport ==
Eschweiler has six railway stations: &quot;Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof&quot; (central station), &quot;Eschweiler-Aue&quot; (from 2009), &quot;Eschweiler-West&quot;, &quot;Eschweiler-Talbahnhof&quot;, &quot;Eschweiler-Nothberg&quot;, &quot;Eschweiler-Weisweiler&quot; and &quot;Nothberg&quot; (till 2009). &quot;Eschweiler-St. Jöris&quot; is planned.

<doc id="1120306" wikidata="Q16387175" url="?curid=1120306" title="Murther and Walking Spirits">
<text>Murther and Walking Spirits, first published by McClelland and Stewart in 1991, is a novel by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies.

&quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot; is, in a way, another ghost story, a genre Davies visited in his short story collection &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1982). In the very first sentence of the novel, &quot;Gil&quot; Gilmartin, the protagonist and narrator, is a film critic who comes home to find his attractive wife having an affair with a nerdy coworker, who strikes him with a walking stick in fear, causing his death. His ghost then attends a strange film festival. While the attendees see actual films, Gilmartin is shown &quot;films&quot; detailing the lives of his ancestors, such as one who was a Tory during the American Revolution or another who was a master carpenter who married a blue-blooded woman, only to have it end in a nasty divorce. The films, dealing as they do with more and more recent subjects, bring the novel to its modern-day conclusion. Gilmartin&#x27;s ghost is able to cross over when his killer confesses to the newspaper editor, who chides him for the sin, but also for society in general: &quot;It&#x27;s a hot dinner for the wrongdoer and the victims struggle&quot;. Rather than surrender the killer to the authorities, the editor says his punishment should be to carry that walking stick for the rest of his life, akin to a &quot;mark of Cain&quot;. Gilmartin also learns that prior to his death, he had impregnated his wife, and his ancestors&#x27; tribulations may have been shown to him as a sign the bloodline will continue. The final scene is where Gilmartin finds himself in the sky, being addressed by a feminine voice. Thinking it at first to be his deceased mother, she says she is not, but &quot;the woman in the man&quot;, thinking of a remark one of his newspaper coworkers made.

Davies used his own ancestry — Welsh and United Empire Loyalist — as inspiration for the &quot;films&quot; presented.

The novel is prefaced with a quote from Samuel Butler: &quot;But where Murthers and Walking Spirits meet, there is no other Narrative can come near it.&quot; (The word &quot;murther&quot; is an archaic spelling of &quot;murder&quot;.)

&quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot; was not well received by critics, and sales of the book were disappointing compared to Davies&#x27; previous works.

Unlike Davies&#x27; previous novels, &quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot; was not part of a trilogy. There is some supposition, however, that had Davies lived long enough this novel and his next novel, &quot;The Cunning Man&quot;, might have constituted another trilogy. In fact, in his introduction to &quot;The Merry Heart&quot; (1996), a collection of Davies&#x27; writings published posthumously, Davies&#x27; publisher, Douglas M. Gibson, tells how Davies had been researching and preparing the novel which would have followed &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; and would have been the third in the series. Gibson speculated that this unfinished trilogy might have been called the &quot;Toronto Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="1120307" wikidata="Q1260928" url="?curid=1120307" title="Pneumatic weapon">
<text>A pneumatic weapon is a weapon that fires a projectile by
means of air pressure, similar in principle to the operation of pneumatic tube delivery systems. The term comes from a Greek word for &quot;wind&quot; or &quot;breath&quot; (πνεῦμα).

== Comparison with firearms ==
In theory, pneumatic weapons have certain advantages over traditional firearms:
*The ammunition needs no propellant or casing; the entire round becomes the projectile. This makes it smaller, lighter, easier and cheaper manufactured, and safer. For the same payload, more projectile can be fired.
*Since no propellant is fired, there is no chemical residue to accumulate in the barrel or chamber, no fumes or odor either.
*Because there is no casing to eject, the firing mechanism can be simpler (resulting in a more reliable and cheaper weapon), and it is theoretically possible to have a higher rate of repeat fire.
*The gas is cool to begin with, and furthermore undergoes adiabatic cooling as it pushes the projectile, instead of being a high temperature mixture. The barrel is not heated to nearly the same extent as with a firearm, and doesn&#x27;t have to withstand such a high temperature.
*Pressure can be controlled and adjusted, instead of being a fixed parameter of the ammunition.

On the other hand, 
*The &quot;action&quot;, or the mechanism by which subsequent rounds are automatically reloaded, must also be powered by the air pressure; that is not a major drawback as pneumatic tools such as the nail gun proves as long as you carry an air tank and compressor around with you.
*The weapon has to supply or be supplied with a source of very high pressure gas. What is won in complexity and weight around the ammunition, is lost on the other hand in reservoir and compressor, which are not that easily provided. In most case the trade-off on this item proves to favor the firearm.

In practice, steam cannons and airguns were developed throughout 17th to 19th century, and the latter even in service with the Austrian army from 1780 to around 1815, but firearms kept the upper hand.

== Pneumatic weapons in the toy industry ==
The low projectile speed requirement of a toy weapon greatly reduces the amount of air pressure needed; combined with the importance of safety in the toy industry, this has led to widespread adoption of pneumatic firing mechanisms in toy weapons, where a propellant reaction is not appropriate (although other technologies, such as rubber bands, can be used).

The toy industry has produced a number of pneumatic toy weapons, which fire small, lightweight (often plastic and frequently hollow) projectiles at relatively low speeds. Airsoft and paintball guns are a popular toy that operates this way; when used with adequate safety equipment (eye protection at a minimum) these may be used in games involving shooting at other players.

BB guns and other low powered air guns are often marketed towards the youth market. However, in many countries they are subject to normal firearms laws, or else a minimum age is imposed for possession and/or purchase. Such items can inflict lethal injuries if misused. In some countries minors may only use even low-powered airguns under the direct supervision of an adult. Gun safety rules should be followed when using air guns and BB guns.

<text>The European Robotic Arm (ERA) is a robotic arm that is attached to 
the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) of the International Space Station. Launched to the ISS in July 2021; it is the first robotic arm that is able to work on the Russian Segment of the station. The arm supplements the two Russian &quot;Strela&quot; cargo cranes that were originally installed on the &quot;Pirs&quot; module, but were later moved to the docking compartment &quot;Poisk&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot; module.

The ERA was developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a number of European space companies. Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands (formerly Dutch Space) designed and assembled the arm and was the prime contractor; it worked along with subcontractors in 8 countries. In 2010, a spare elbow joint for the arm and ERA&#x27;s Portable Workpost was launched preemptively, attached to &quot;Rassvet&quot; or Mini Research Module 1(MRM-1). The &quot;Nauka Module&quot; and Prichal module serves as home base for ERA; originally, the arm was going to be attached to the canceled Russian Research Module and later to the also canceled Science Power Platform.

== Technical characteristics ==
The European Robotic arm consists of two &#x27;limbs&#x27; that are symmetrical sections made primarily of carbon fibre reinforced plastic, and are approximately 5 m (16 ft) long. At either end of the arm are identical gripper mechanisms called End Effectors (EES), which the arm uses to hold onto the station, grab onto payloads, and to assist in EVA activities. In total there are seven motorized joints, three are located at each of the wrists, and allow for roll, yaw, and pitch movements, giving 7 degrees of freedom of movement. The elbow consists of one motorized joint, which is limited to pitch movements. The arm is controlled by the ERA Control Computer (ECC), or On Board Computer (OBC) which is located towards the elbow. The two limb design of the arm gives it the ability to &#x27;walk&#x27; around the exterior of the Russian segment of the station under its own control, moving hand-over-hand between the pre-fixed base points.

When fully extended the arm has a total length of 11.3 m (37 ft), and can reach and has 7 degrees of freedom. It has a mass of 630 kilograms (1,390 lb) and can hold a total payload mass of 8,000 kilograms (18,000 lb). The arm&#x27;s tip can reach a speed of 0.1 metres per second (0.33 ft/s) and has an accuracy of 5 mm (0.20 in). The European Robotics Arm itself was designed to be serviceable with spare parts kept outside Rassvet 
module and allow for the exchange of large parts via EVA in case of failure or an emergency situation. These parts are called EVA Replaceable Units (ERUs), also referred to as Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs), which can all be replaced in-orbit; the ERA is composed of three ERU sections. The arm is wrapped with beta cloth blankets for thermal protection.

On average the arm uses 475 watts of power to operate while having a peak operational power consumption of 800 watts. When on standby the arm only consumes 420 watts, and 250 watts while in hibernation.

=== End effectors ===

Located at either end of the arm are the End Effector Subsystems (EES). The EES is designed to attach specifically with the base points located on the Russian segment of the station. Since the ROS uses different base points than the US Orbital Segment, the arm is unable to operate and access the other parts of the station. The EES consists of two Basic End Effectors (BEE) that connect to Base Points (BP) and Grapple Fixtures (GF). During normal operations, one end effector is connected to a base point on the station, this provides a sufficiently stiff connection between the station and ERA, as well as enabling the transmission of power, data and video signals for operation of the ERA. At the same time, the second end effector provides mechanical and electrical power to the grappled objects, and allows for data transfer. Both of the end effectors are also capable of measuring torques/forces as well as contain a Camera and Lighting Unit (CLU) which aids in the control of the arm; an additional two CLUs are located on both limbs.

==== Integrated Servicing Tool ====
Located within each of the end effectors&#x27; lower compartment is an integrated servicing tool. It is used to provide torque for a grappled object, acting like a wrench. It is capable of screwing and unscrewing bolts. The IST head starts with rotating slowly at first upon system comment, until popping into the IST head receptacle, which allows it to provide the mechanical power to the screw interface.

=== Hardware and software ===
The ERA is controlled from a central computer called the ERA control computer. Control is assisted by the additional microprocessors located in the different subsystems.

==== ERA control computer (ECC) ====
The &quot;ECC&quot; is located towards the elbow of the &quot;ERA&quot;, and composes three main components; the &quot;Application Layer&quot; (AL), the &quot;Service Layer&quot; (SL), and the operating system (OS). The application layer contains the high level command, mission plan, and event handling; the service layer contains the main robot motion control loops, motion related checks and image processing; together the AL and SL constitute the Application software (ASW). Together the OS and ASW provide the main control the arm.

Located with in the ECC&#x27;s RISC subsystem is the ERA&#x27;s main central processing unit (CPU). The main CPU is a Temic designed ERC32 with 10 MHz clock, addressing 1.5 megabytes (Mb) of memory, as well as 32 kilobytes (Kb) of ROM.

The ECC&#x27;s I/O subsystem includes an Intel 80C186 with 11 MHz clock addressing 16 kB ROM. It handles the communications between the RISC processor and the other subsystems of the ERA.

The ECC&#x27;s housekeeping subsystem includes an Intel 80C31 with 8 kB ROM.

==== Joint subsystem ====
Located in each wrist and in the elbow, there is one microprocessor that takes care of the bus communication, local inhibits, and safety checks, as well as general housekeeping.

The communications of the Joint subsystem are handled by the Joint I/O which includes an Intel 80C31 with 8 MHz clock, and 24kB of ROM, as well as communication through dual ported RAM.

The control of the subsystem was handled by an Intel 80C32 with 27 MHz clock, addressing 16 kB ROM and 8 kB DPRAM. The processor ran high speed digital control loops.

==== End effector subsystem ====
While the ECC handles primary control of the end effectors, the EES still includes its own micro-processor to aid in control.

Using a torque/force sensor inside the end effectors, the ECC actively controls the arm&#x27;s pose to keep the contact forces within tight limits. To handle the drift and calibration, the torque force sensor pre-processes the data locally, with its own microprocessor. The processor located within the sensor is an Intel 80C86 with 7.2 MHz clock, addressing 64kB of memory and 32 kB ROM.

A separate processor in the end effector control electronics takes care of the bus communication, grapple mechanism control, and general housekeeping. The processor also controls the Integrated Service Tool. The processor is Intel 80C31 with 12 MHz clock, addressing 32 kB RAM and 48 kB ROM.

== Control ==
Astronauts can control the ERA from both inside and outside the space station. The ERA is also the only robotic arm on the station to not include controllers, but is instead controlled through several different interfaces. While possessing multiple control modes, it is primarily used in autotrajectory mode, but manually selectable single-joint modes are also available. In addition to being able to be controlled from the station, ground operators can control the arm, as well.

=== EVA control ===
Control from outside the space station uses a specially designed interface that can be controlled while in a spacesuit known as the Extra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (EVA-MMI or EMMI). The EVA-MII has 16 LED displays of eight characters each; displaying essential status data, command verification data and emergency caution and warning messages. It also provides redundancy for critical status data through redundant LEDs.

The EVA-MMI allows for manual control of the arm in emergencies during an EVA. During manual control, only one degree of freedom at a time in a joint space, or one degree of freedom in Cartesian Space is able to be used. Also on the console is the emergency stop button which, when pressed, will activate brakes in all joints and at the same time send a command to the Russian Segment to switch the whole arm off. Whenever the ERA is active, there will always be two astronauts with an EVA-MMI, at two different locations. One has full control of the arm, while the other can at times issue an emergency stop command, as well as take over control of the arm. The EVA-MMI can survive long periods of space exposure, totaling up to 18 months.

=== Onboard control ===
Control from inside the space station is done by the Intra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (IVA-MMI), using a laptop, which shows a computer generated model of the ERA and its surroundings. As well on several monitors, video feeds from the arm are also available. In comparison to the EVA-MMI, the IVA-MMI provides more data from the arm, including the intended position of the arm. The IVA-MMI is used during servicing missions. The control systems finished development in 2001.

== Capabilities ==
The ERA has the ability to operate under manual control, as well as automatically or semi-automatically. The autonomy of the arm allows for astronauts to focus on other tasks, due to being freed up from others that the ERA can cover.

Specific tasks of the ERA include:
* Installation, removal or replacement of experiment payloads
* Transferring payloads in and out of the Station through the Russian airlock
* Inspection of the Station with the use of cameras
* Handling of (external) payloads
* Support of astronauts during space walks
*Freeing cosmonauts to do other work during spacewalks
Before the cancelation of the Science Power Platform, the first task of the ERA included the assembly of solar arrays on the Russian Orbital Segment, as well as replacement of said solar arrays. Many of the arms early tasks were associated with the platform.

==Development and service history==

=== Early design ===
Design on the European Robotic Arm started in 1985, with Fokker Space performing a study for ESA on a 10-meter (33 ft.) manipulator arm for the Hermes Space Plane, known as the Hermes Robotic Arm (HERA). It functioned similarly to the Canadarm on the American Space Shuttle; being located within the cargo bay and controlled from the cockpit. The arm was attached to the Hermes at the shoulder. Due to design problems, the Hermes cargo bay had to become a closed structure, with HERA being relocated an end structure called the &quot;Hermes Resource Module&quot;.

After the decision to cancel the Hermes program, ESA and the Russian Space Agency, in 1992, agreed to use the HERA technology to service the Mir-2 Space Station. The name was then changed to the European Robotic Arm (ERA). It was here that a control computer was added to the arm&#x27;s design, as well as two new operational consoles were designed, one for a cosmonaut in EVA, and one for a cosmonaut inside the station.

The following year in 1993, Russia agreed to join in the merging of the Space Station Alpha with the Mir-2 into one International Space Station. Following this, the ERA elements of Mir-2 were adapted to the Russian segment of the station, and would act as the main assembly and servicing toll for the segment.

=== Science Power Platform ===

With the shift to the ISS, the ESA and &quot;Roscosmos&quot; signed a cooperation agreement about the ERA in 1996, and would have the arm be a part of the canceled Russian Research Module, with development beginning in 1998. Following the cancellation of the Research Module ERA was moved to the Russian Science Power Platform, which would have become the base of operations for the arm. Its first mission after being relocated to its storage position would have been to install part of the solar array system. The arm would have then aided in the day-to-day needs of the station and would have seen 10 years of service.

In September 1994 the ERA System Requirements Review was completed. The completion of the review cleared the way to start full development of ERA. In early 1995 a Request of Quotation was released and six months later the DDT&amp;E contract was signed between ESA and Fokker Space. The Preliminary Design Review for ERA was completed in 1996. Payload mass and clearance limitations resulted in ERA no longer launching with the Science Power Platform on a Proton Rocket; instead ERA was moved to a space shuttle launch.

With the change to a shuttle launch, two major changes to the ERA design were made in 1997. The first being that the joints were altered to facilitate launch on the Space Shuttle. Secondly the ERA on-board computers were switched to being based on the ESA&#x27;s Data Management System. That same year also saw evaluation and review of the Man Machine Interfaces for ERA start. The inclusion of ISS astronauts and cosmonauts along with experts led to several design improvements. Manufacturing and testing of ERA engineering models also started in 1997. The electrical interface model was shipped to Russia to verify electrical interfaces between the ERA systems and elements of the Russian segment of the ISS.

1998 saw several components being delivered both to Russia and ESA. Early that year the Geometric model was sent to Russia for fit-checks and configuration analysis. The first flight equipment was also delivered to Russia, that being the grapple fixture basepoints. In March of that year the Weightless Environment Test model &quot;WET&quot; underwent acceptance activities at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. In May 2000, all major components of the ERA were delivered to Fokker Space allowing for the start of the assembly, integration and test program at the flat-floor test facility. Construction of the ERA was finished in 2001.

Originally planned to be launched in 2001 on a Space Shuttle, it was later delayed to 2002. Following further delays and launch set-backs, the launch date was left uncertain following the hold on the Space Shuttle program due to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, as well as the cancelation of the Science Power Platform.

=== Nauka===

In 2004, Roscosmos introduced the Multipurpose Laboratory Module Upgrade (MLM-U), also called &quot;Nauka&quot;, and proposed that the ERA could be installed, launched and operated on the module. An agreement was reached and ERA was transferred to &quot;Nauka&quot;. The &quot;Nauka&quot; module was not designed for launch on a Space Shuttle and instead would be launched on a Russian Proton rocket. The following year, ESA signed a contract with Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands to prepare the ERA to launch on a Proton rocket in November 2007.

Training of instructors was complete in 2005 with two training courses being held at ESTEC with nine Russian instructors receiving certification the following year after a refresher training course in June 2006.

In February and March 2006, the Mission Preparation and Training Equipment for the European Robotic Arm was delivered in Russia, which would be used for training to use the arm as well as preparation for both its launch and use. Equipment was also delivered to the Russian Mission Control Centre for the ISS, and would be used for mission monitoring purposes.

Following technical issues, the launch was delayed from 2007 to 2012. In 2010, the Space Shuttle Atlantis delivered Rassvet (Mini Research Module 1) on STS-132, (as a part of an agreement with NASA) to the station, which included a spare elbow joint with 2 limbs to allow the actual to repair itself while in orbit and the Portable Work Platform for the ERA, which will be used during EVAs. Further delays resulted in the ERA launch being delayed to 2014.

Due to issues in the development of the MLM module, the launch was further delayed, and the earliest it could have launched was the end of 2015. Further issues with &quot;Nauka&quot; resulted in the launch being delayed several more times until January 2021. Due to concerns over the novel coronavirus, work on the Proton rocket and &quot;Nauka&quot; was delayed, which resulted in the launch being delayed to May 2021.

In May 2020 the ERA was shipped to Baikonur for final processing. On 20 May 2021 the arm was attached to the hull of the &quot;Nauka&quot; module.

The ERA was launched on 21 July 2021 atop a Proton rocket alongside the &quot;Nauka&quot; module, 20 years after its originally planned launch and 35 years after it was first designed. It successfully docked and was attached to the station on 29 July 2021 at 13:29 UTC.

==== Launch configuration ====

During launch the ERA was located in a launch position on Nauka, referred to as the &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; configuration. During launch, both of the end effectors were grappled on to a special base point, each acting as a load suspension system. The arm was also attached to Nauka by the means of six launch fixation mechanisms. Each mechanism consisted of one or two hooks that tied down the ERA to its mounting seat, during future EVA&#x27;s these hooks will be released allowing for ERA to start to prepare for operations. These attachment points are located at the elbow joint, the wrist electronic boxes and the roll joints.

=== Bringing ERA to functionality ===
Following the completion of the Nauka module being connected to the ISS via a series of cables, the ERA will be deployed. It will take five spacewalks to assemble and prepare the robotic arm to be fit for space operations. The first of these, originally scheduled for January 2022 but were delayed to 18 April 2022, will involve the removal of external covers and launch restraints, following which the ERA will be activated and undergo an In-Orbit Validation. The validation is necessary as to establish the on-orbit performance of the arm and ensure that it can perform all required function, in conjunction with the ground equipment. Following this the ERA will be thoroughly checked out to ensure that it is safe to move from its launch position to its first in-orbit home base position. Before ERA can began normal operations a series of performance tests will also be conducted. All necessary checks and assembly of ERA were originally planned to occur within 6 months of &quot;Nauka&quot; docking with the ISS but have since been pushed back. Following the performance tests an 8 weeks on-ground post analysis will be conducted on the recorded on-orbit data.

The ERA will need to be fully operational in order to proceed with the next phase of operations – which is transferring the outfittings for &quot;Nauka&quot;.

==== ERA validation operations and deployment ====
The assembly and Validation of the European Robotic Arm will be conducted in five different stages. The first part was the connecting and testing of ERA and its control interfaces, as well as conducting an initial check of the arm. This was performed on 22 September 2021 when ESA astronaut and Flight Engineer Thomas Pesquet, worked with Roscosmos cosmonaut and Flight Engineer Pyotr Dubrov in &quot;Nauka&quot; to configure the ERA controller hardware and software. During testing the ERA laptop, external control panel and the Russian control computer were shown to being working well, and able to communicate with each other but initial tests showed glitches in data transmission between Zvezda and Nauka which could cause delays to ERA deployment. Communication links between the ISS, Russian Mission Control Centre, and the European Robotic Arm Support center in the Netherlands were successfully tested. Initial checks also included the validation of the external Man Machine Interface and that the ERA can communicate properly while connected to a base point located on the outside of the ISS. To validate the MMI an EVA was required.

On 18 April the first in a series of space walks was conducted by cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev and Denis Matveev; taking seven hours to complete. During the EVA the EVA-MMI was installed the outside of the station and subsequently conducted a diagnostic test to confirm that the panel was receiving power and in good working order. Following the completion of the installation of the EVA-MMI the cosmonauts removed covers from the arm&#x27;s grapple fixtures and base plates, as well as on the elbow. Following the removal of the elbow covers handrails were installed on the arm.

The second stage included the installation and validation of the ERA&#x27;s transfer capabilities. During this stage both the internal and external MMI were evaluated. During an EVA an astronaut will remove the launch restraints keeping the ERA in its launch configuration as well as remove the remainder of launch covers. On 28 April 2022, the second of the series of space walks occurred, during which Artemyev and Martveev unstowed the arm from its launch position by releasing actuators enabling the arm&#x27;s grip, freed additional launch locks, as well as installed handrails to ease working on and around the device. Following this the ERA was extended and commanded to attach to existing interfaces on Nauka, and moved to the forward-facing side of the module. During the EVA the arm was controlled by Sergey Korsakov. A third EVA in the series was scheduled to occur in mid-May and was performed by Oleg Artemyev and Samantha Cristoforetti.

On June 22, 2022, an attempt to connect to the BTL-3 grapple fixture was successful and perform the base command and control was changed to ERA EE1 from EE2 on BTL-2 fixtures.

During this stage, EVA cameras were installed by an astronaut, which are located on the wrist and elbow joint of the ERA. Following the completion of the EVAs needed on the ERA, joint tests were carried out, followed by multiple joint tests. Following the completion of these tests, the ERA was relocated by grappling base points on the surface of the ISS and was checked by being commanded to grapple and relocate the Portable Work Platform. The portable work platform launched with the spare elbow joint on MRM-1 in 2010 can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to ride on the end of the arm during spacewalks. Upon completion the ERA was placed in hibernation mode.

The third stage was the brakes run-in, thermal validation and imaging quality checks. This had the brakes run-in so that they function correctly to manipulate heavy payloads. As well thermal parameters were monitored inside the ERA at different points. Finally the ERA cameras were evaluated under different lighting conditions, and included the accuracy in proximity targeting by the end effector cameras as well as image quality.

The final two stages of preparation of the ERA for full operation was checking its motion performance as well the procession of data on the ground. After completion of all five stages of the In-Orbit Validation to a satisfactory level, the ERA validation ended, and the ERA system was considered ready for operational use.

====Installation of outfitting equipment for Nauka ====

====Commissioning of ERA portable workpost====
A portable work platform sent to ISS along with Rassvet was also transferred over as the last MLM-outfitting in August 2023 during VKD-60 spacewalk, which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to &quot;ride&quot; on the end of the arm during spacewalks. This completed the ERA outfitting tasks.

== Mission Preparation and Training Equipment ==
Mission Preparation and Training Equipment (MPTE) are tools and facilities developed by National Aerospace Laboratory - NLR, used in the training of astronauts and operators, supporting maintenance, as well as aiding in missions. Three identical versions of the MPTE were installed at Rocket-Space Corporation Energia RSC/E, the Russian Mission Control Centre for the ISS, the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC), as well as the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC). Both the arm and the MPTE had to be designed to be able to function and operate for a minimum of 10 years.

In February and March 2006, the MPTE was delivered to several locations in Russia. Due to the delays in the launch, much of the hardware in the computer systems had surpassed its expected life span. As a result, it had become hard to maintain the computers in the MPTE as spare parts were becoming obsolete, and hard to find. As well the ERA software maintenance facility underwent a complete upgrade to the latest software development tools at the time.

=== ERA Operation Plan ===
The MPTE is used for composing an ERA Operations Plan (EOP), based on the Mission Plan for the Russian Segment, which contains all information about the segment to plan a detailed ERA mission.

An ERA Operation Plan, in general, contains:

* ERA Actions
* Auto Sequences, the sequence of commands which will be executed automatically by the ECC 
* ERA Tasks, a subset of the Auto Sequence composed of logical groups of individual commands or actions
* ERA Uplinkable Command List (EUCL), one or more auto sequences, where are ERA commands are the implementation of planned actions to control one of the ERA&#x27;s subsystems

=== European Robotic Arm simulator ===
The European Robotic Arm Simulator, comprised completely of a digital simulator, that uses the EuroSim program, is designed to train astronauts to use the ERA. The simulator is set up such that an astronaut can operate a command console while standing in front of a large realistic visualization. The ERA simulator includes the reuse of existing software that was created to aid in the development of the arm itself, such as the ERA Simulator Facility, as well as existing software such as the Image Generation Subsystem of EuroSim.

==== Refresher Trainer ====
To complement the training astronauts receive on the ground, The Refresher Trainer provides the crew on board the ISS with the capability to rehearse their missions. The Refresher Trainer is a software application running on a laptop computer; it contains simulations for internal and external Man Machine Interfaces, session manager to prepare, store and replay mission sessions, as well as all relevant reference documents on the ERA. Acceptance testing on the Refresher Trainer was completed in 2006.

== Test models ==

=== Weightlessness Environment Test Model ===
Commonly referred to as the WET model, the Weightless Environment Test model was a mockup of the ERA that was located at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC), in Moscow, Russia. Attached to a mockup of &quot;Nauka&quot;, both were submerged in a large pool in the Hydrolab facility. Here it was used by astronauts, for the testing of the arm in a simulated weightless environment. Astronauts would don suites designed to mimic the conditions of wearing a spacesuit, as well as the weightless environment. The WET model was also used in the training of astronauts, including practice of the choreography of arm motion and EVA tasks.

In 2005, ESA astronaut André Kuipers and his colleague Dimitry Verba, conducted the first trial on the arm. This involved assembling the arm in the weightless environment, and was used to make recommendations of changes to the final arm, before its launch in 2021.

=== Additional models ===
In addition to the WET model of the ERA, several other models were used in testing. The Geometric Model was used in testing the geometric fit of the ERA on its launch interface, as well as in critical operational situations. The mass and stiffness model (MSM) was used to test the arm in a vibration test in the launch configuration. Other models included the thermal and structural models, as well as the Engineering Qualification Model; all used in testing and validation of the ERA&#x27;s systems and structure.

== Other robotic systems at the ISS ==
The International Space Station features numerous additional robotic arms and robotic systems, which serve many different functions. The first of these is the Space Station Remote Manipulator System, more commonly known as the Canadarm2. The Canadarm2 uses the PDGF grapple fixtures on the US Orbital segment, and since they are different from the grapple fixtures on the Russian segment, the arm is unable to be used on the segment, except for the &quot;Zarya module.&quot; Alongside the Canadarm2 is the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, also known as &quot;Dextre&quot; or &quot;Canada hand&quot;. Dextre has two robotic arms, fixed to its body, but because the Russian grapple fixtures are different, that arm and Dextre can only be used on the &quot;Zarya&quot; module of the Russian segment since a PDGF was installed in 2011 during STS-134.

An additional arm is fixed on the Japanese Experiment Module, the Remote Manipulator System (JEM-RMS), also known as &quot;Kibo&quot;. The arm was added to the station during STS-124. The arm uses a similar PDGF grapple fixture to Canadarm2, but is primarily used to service the JEM Exposed Facility.

Because all Russian and European spacecraft dock automatically there is no need to manipulate spacecraft on the Russian segment so it is not necessary for ERA to be as large or handle as large of loads as Canadarm2.

Originally connected to &quot;Pirs&quot;, the ISS also has two Strela cargo cranes. One of the cranes could be extended to reach the end of Zarya. The other could extend to the opposite side and reach the end of Zvezda. The first crane was assembled in space during STS-96 and STS-101. The second crane was launched alongside Pirs itself. The cranes were later moved to the docking compartment &quot;Poisk&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot; module.

=== Comparison with Canadarm2 ===
The Canadarm2 is a large robotic arm on the US Orbital Segment of the station. Due to the similarities between the ERA and the Canadarm2 a comparison can be made between the two. Both arms perform Station maintenance, are able to move supplies and equipment, inspection of the station, as well as aid astronauts during spacewalks. Where they differ is that the ERA is able to function completely automatically or semi-automatically, as well be directed either from inside or outside the station. The Canadarm2 has to be controlled by a human, whether that be by astronauts on board the ISS or be a ground team at the CSA headquarters or NASA The ERA is less powerful and smaller than the Canadarm2 as it is not required to dock spacecraft with the station. Due to the difference between the grapple fixtures between the ROS and the USOS of the station, the Canadarm2 is only able to operate on the USOS while the ERA is only able to operate on the ROS. Both arms are able to move around from point to point, end-over-end on the station, with them being able to self-relocate.

The ERA is in length, shorter than the Canadarm2 which is in length. The ERA is also lighter by , with the arm being as opposed to the Canadarm2&#x27;s 1,800 kg (4,000 lb). The maximum payload mass of the ERA is , as opposed to the Canadarm2&#x27;s maximum payload mass at 116,000 kg (256,000 lb).

<text>Mühlhausen () is a town in the north-west of Thuringia, Germany, north of Niederdorla, the country&#x27;s geographical centre, north-west of Erfurt, east of Kassel and south-east of Göttingen.

Mühlhausen was first mentioned in 967 and became one of the most important cities in central Germany in the late Middle Ages. In the mid-13th century, it became a &quot;Freie Reichsstadt&quot;, an independent and republican self-ruled member of the Holy Roman Empire, controlling an area of approximately and 19 regional villages. Due to its long-distance trade, Mühlhausen was prosperous and influential with a population of 10,000 around 1500. Because it was spared from later destruction, Mühlhausen today has a great variety of historical buildings with one of the largest medieval city centres remaining in Germany, covering a surface of more than 50 hectares within the inner city wall and approximately 200 hectares overall. There are eleven Gothic churches, several patricians’ houses and a nearly completely preserved fortification.

Johann Sebastian Bach worked as the city&#x27;s organist in 1707–08. The theologian Thomas Müntzer, a leading person in the German Peasants&#x27; War, gave sermons here and was executed outside the city walls. John A. Roebling, the constructor of the Brooklyn Bridge, and Friedrich August Stüler, an influential architect in mid-19th-century Prussia, were born in Mühlhausen.

Mühlhausen is within the Thuringian Basin, a flat and fertile area, on the Unstrut river on the eastern edge of the Hainich hills.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
According to legend, in the 5th century Attila stayed at &quot;Burg Mulhus&quot; as a guest of his Thuringii allies before moving on to the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains.
Within the north-eastern parts of the city centre around St. George&#x27;s Church, sizeable archaeological finds have been made, relating to a large settlement of the Thuringii/Francia period (from the 6th to the early 10th century), which can be seen as the origin of the later city. Mühlhausen itself was first mentioned in 967 was part of a territory given by Otto II to his wife Theophanu. It belonged to the &quot; ab initio&quot;, i.e. there was no territorial lord other than the German emperor and the area was not the emperor&#x27;s own property, so that it did not go to his son after his death but reverted to his successor as emperor, even if he was from another family. The emperors had a in Mühlhausen, which they often visited from Otto III to Henry III during the 10th and 11th centuries. The election of Philip of Swabia in 1198 ended with a homage in Mühlhausen, attended by Walther von der Vogelweide.

In 1135, Mühlhausen was first referred to as a &quot;villa&quot; which can be seen as the beginning of the evolution from a settlement to a city. During the early 12th century, the &quot;old town&quot; was set up around the along the , an important trade route between the Kassel and the Erfurt regions. The fortifications were erected after 1170, eventually including 52 towers. In the early 13th century, the &quot;new town&quot; north of Schwemmnotte river followed with a regular grid around St. Mary&#x27;s Church and with as main streets. The Teutonic Knights received St. Blaise&#x27;s Church (Divi-Blasii) in 1227 and St. Mary&#x27;s Church in 1243 from the emperor, which ensured them influence in the city and high revenues. The largest monastery of Mühlhausen was the 1227-founded at , a Magdalenians monastery. It held large estates in the region and its buildings were demolished in 1884. The Franciscans came to the city in 1225 and built their monastery around today&#x27;s Corn Market Church and the Dominicans established a monastery in 1289 near ; their church was demolished after a fire in 1689, only some walls remained. Jews have lived in Mühlhausen at least since the late 13th century; the runs parallel to in the new town. During the Black Death Jewish persecutions in 1349, many Mühlhausen Jews were killed.
In the mid-13th century, the citizens emancipated more and more from the emperor&#x27;s rule. For example, Conrad IV had to concede the established wall between the city and the (emperor&#x27;s court) and later in the 13th century, the citizens destroyed the court. From 1251, Mühlhausen was referred to as a and became the second most powerful city in Thuringia after Erfurt. The &quot;Mühlhausen Law Book&quot; (1224) is the oldest book of law in the German language and regulated the law of the city. In 1308/09, Mühlhausen allied with Erfurt and Nordhausen against the Wettins, who tried to get these three major Thuringian cities under their rule. The alliance lasted nearly 200 years and was successful. After 1348, Mühlhausen did not have to pay any more taxes to the emperor, so that its independence was complete. The three cities pursued their own territorial policy (e.g. by buying castles) to protect their trade routes against robbery, which brought them constantly into conflict with local nobles. Another aspect of the territorial policy was buying land and villages around the city, making use of any opportunity that presented itself, for example if local rulers (counts, monasteries etc.) needed money. Mühlhausen bought 19 still existing and 43 later abandoned villages and an area of in this way, covering the north-western part of today&#x27;s district Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis. The villages had to pay taxes to Mühlhausen and were secured by the Mühlhausen , a moat of length with several towers () to observe the region.

The economic heyday between the mid-13th and the early 16th century was a result of long-distance trade with textiles, woad and other goods. In 1286, Mühlhausen had joined the Hanseatic League. By the mid-15th century it was one of the largest cities in Germany.

=== Early modern period ===

The Reformation brought disturbances to Mühlhausen. The monk and peasant leader Heinrich Pfeiffer from Reifenstein Abbey preached at St. Mary&#x27;s in February 1523 for the first time, followed by Thomas Müntzer in August 1524. Both had not only religious demands (they were members of the Anabaptist movement) but also political ones, aimed against the privileges of the magistracies and their oligarchic rule over the city. The city council was deposed and replaced by an &quot;Eternal Council&quot; (). During the German Peasants&#x27; War 1524/25, the city&#x27;s monasteries were looted and the &quot;Bildersturm&quot; devastated the churches. After the emperor&#x27;s army defeated the uprising, Müntzer, Pfeiffer and other leaders were executed. Müntzer&#x27;s execution on 27 May 1525 took place right outside the city. Furthermore, the city had to pay a fine of 40,000 guilders to the empire and partially lost its independence, because the Hessians and both lines of the Wettins (Ernestines and Albertines) were appointed to control the city government. By contrast to these three rulers, Mühlhausen remained Catholic and became a secret member of the Nuremberg League, an alliance of catholic territories in the empire, founded in 1538. After the three rulers realized that in 1542, the Reformation was introduced by force in Mühlhausen by Justus Menius. The Schmalkaldic War resulted in the defeat of the Hessians and the Ernestines by the emperor in 1547 and partially returned the city&#x27;s independence. In foreign policy it had to coordinate with the Albertines and it had to pay taxes to the empire. After 1710, Hanover was Mühlhausen&#x27;s protecting power.

Johann Sebastian Bach was organist of the church Divi Blasii from 1707 until 1708. Among the works Bach composed while living in the town was an elaborate, festive cantata, &quot;Gott ist mein König&quot;, BWV 71, for the inauguration of the new council in 1708.

Internal dissensions and destruction caused during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) and the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) helped in bringing about Mühlhausen&#x27;s decline. In addition, Leipzig&#x27;s rise as a trade fair town and new long-distance trading routes like also contributed by decreasing the city&#x27;s trade and damaging the finances of the city. The German mediatization led to the formal loss (that had de facto already occurred) of Mühlhausen&#x27;s independence in 1803, as the city became part of Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars it was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 until 1815, when it became part of Prussia again according to the decisions of the Congress of Vienna.

=== Since 1815 ===
After 1815, Mühlhausen was part of the newly created Prussian Province of Saxony, where the Mühlhausen district was established. In 1831, the Mühlhausen-born civil engineer John A. Roebling, later constructor of the Brooklyn Bridge, emigrated to the United States. The era of industrialisation and urbanisation reached Mühlhausen relatively late, around 1870, when the city was connected to the railway by a line from Gotha to Leinefelde. In 1892, Mühlhausen became an independent city district. In 1898, the municipal power station was founded and the tramway network started its operation in Mühlhausen. Major industries were textiles and engineering.

Between 1910 and 1917, the provincial hospital of Pfafferode was built on the western edge of the city, one of the largest hospitals in the Prussian Province of Saxony. The Great Depression after 1929 hit Mühlhausen very hard and led to massive unemployment. In 1935, the Nazi armament campaign resulted in the building of a large military complex with several barracks with the deliberate side effect of boosting the city&#x27;s weak economy. The synagogue was damaged during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in November 1938, but as one of only a few in Germany, it was not completely destroyed and still stands today. At the Pfafferode hospital, nearly 2,000 patients were killed or died during the Nazi period (Action T4), most of them were mentally or physically disabled. From 1944 to March 1945, a women&#x27;s forced labour camp was located directly outside Mühlhausen (a branch of the Buchenwald camp), producing arms. The women were deported in April 1945 to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The US Army arrived in Mühlhausen on 4 April 1945 and the city was handed over without a fight. On 5 July 1945, the Soviet Army took over the city, which became part of the GDR in 1949.

In 1975, the 450th obit of Thomas Müntzer, the city was officially renamed &quot;Thomas-Müntzer-Stadt Mühlhausen&quot;. Müntzer and the German Peasants&#x27; War received a lot of attention from the GDR government and East-German historians; they referred to it as &quot;Frühbürgerliche Revolution&quot; (early bourgeois revolution) and included it in their Marxist conception of history. Many exhibitions were set up (including some of the museums in Mühlhausen and the &quot;Bauernkriegspanorama&quot; near Bad Frankenhausen) and events celebrating the historical connection took place. After German reunification, the focus on Müntzer and the Peasants&#x27; War ended. The city name was changed back to plain &quot;Mühlhausen&quot; in 1991.

After reunification, many factories in Mühlhausen were closed, leading to another deep economic crisis with high unemployment rates during the 1990s and early 2000s. On the other hand, the city&#x27;s architectural heritage was rediscovered and the restoration of the historic city centre began.

== Geography and demographics ==
=== Topography ===
Mühlhausen is situated in the flat landscape of the Thuringian Basin, a very fertile area covering the northern centre of Thuringia at an elevation of approximately 215 metres above sea level. To the north and west, the terrain gets hilly, whereas to the south and east lie wide agricultural areas, much like most of the municipal territory itself. Furthermore, there are two forests within the territory: the &quot;Stadtwald&quot; (as part of the Hainich) in the west and the &quot;Mühlhäuser Hardt&quot; between the Windeberg district and Menteroda. Both are broadleaf forests with beeches prevalent. The Hainich hills south-west of Mühlhausen became Thuringia&#x27;s only National Park in 1997 because of their old near-natural beech forests. The highest hills within the Mühlhausen terrain reach approximately 400 metres of elevation. The main river crossing the city in northwest–southeast direction is the Unstrut. Furthermore, there are many small tributaries running from the western hills through Mühlhausen to the Unstrut like the Schwemmnotte, which is dividing the inner city.

Germany&#x27;s accurate geographical centre is located only south of the city in the neighbouring municipality of Niederdorla, where a monument can be found at this spot.

=== Climate ===
The average annual temperature in Mühlhausen is .

With an annual precipitation of only , the climate in Mühlhausen is relatively dry, compared to other regions in Germany.

=== Administrative division ===
Mühlhausen abuts the following municipalities (all of them are part of the Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis): Anrode, Unstruttal and Menteroda in the north, Obermehler and Körner in the east, Vogtei in the south and Rodeberg in the west. In the direction of Ammern (part of Unstruttal) there is no interruption in the build-up area, the &quot;Ruhrstraße&quot; forms an urban municipal border here.

The city itself (in addition to the core town) includes the following villages (population as of March 2021):
The former municipality Weinbergen which consisted of the villages Bollstedt, Grabe, Höngeda, and Seebach was merged into Mühlhausen in January 2019. In January 2023 Mühlhausen absorbed the village Hollenbach from the former municipality Anrode. In January 2024 it absorbed the village Eigenrieden from the former municipality Rodeberg.

=== Demographics ===
Mühlhausen had approximately 10,000 inhabitants during the late Middle Ages around 1500, which made it the second-largest number within today&#x27;s Thuringia, after Erfurt, the current capital. The early modern period brought stagnation to the city, so that the population was still 10,000 around 1800. Mühlhausen fell back behind the new ducal residence cities like Weimar, Gotha or Altenburg in this period and lost its former importance. Furthermore, the traffic routes changed during the 19th century and Mühlhausen lost its good connections. Industrialization started later than in other German cities. Nevertheless, the population grew to 14,000 in 1850, 23,000 in 1880 and 35,000 in 1910, which was a significantly lower rate of growth than in other cities of comparable size during that period of rapid urbanisation in Germany. By 1940, the population had increased to 42,000 and with German refugees from eastern Europe, the peak was reached around 1950 with a population of 52,000. Since that time, the population has decreased to 43,000 in 1988, 39,000 in 2000 and 33,000 in 2012 (the statistical adjustment during the 2011 Census led to a loss of 3,000 persons).

The average decline in population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.38% p.a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions has been shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Mühlhausen. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others were Unstruttal and Weinbergen.

The birth deficit was 203 in 2012, this is −6.1 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +1.2 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Mühlhausen migrants are rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like other eastern German cities, foreigners account for only a small share of Mühlhausen&#x27;s population: circa 1.6% are non-Germans by citizenship and 4.2% overall are classified as migrants (according to the 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the largest groups of migrants in Mühlhausen are Russians and Ukrainians.

Due to the official atheism of the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 19.8% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 10.3% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Museums ===

There are several museums in Mühlhausen:
* The &quot;Müntzergedenkstätte&quot; inside St. Mary&#x27;s Church was opened in 1975 and shows an exhibition about Thomas Müntzer and various other items of cultural history.
* The &quot;Bauernkriegsmuseum&quot; inside the Corn Market Church shows an exhibition about the &quot;Bauernkrieg&quot; (German Peasants&#x27; War) and its importance for German history.
* The &quot;Museumsgalerie&quot; inside the All Saints Church hosts some art exhibitions: a permanent one with Thuringian art of different epoques and temporary ones of modern art. 
* The &quot;Museum am Lindenbühl&quot; exhibits the municipal history of Mühlhausen and the regional history of north-western Thuringia including natural history and archaeology. 
* The &quot;Wehrgang&quot; is part of the medieval city wall, accessible next to the Frauentor gate. It gives access to a large stretch of the city walls and the towers.
* The &quot;1st German Bratwurst Museum&quot; was reopened in Mühlhausen on 16 August 2023 after moving from Holzhausen.

=== Cityscape ===
The historic city centre of Mühlhausen consists of three parts. Within the inner city wall are the &quot;old town&quot; (south of Schwemmnotte river around Untermarkt and St. Blaise&#x27;s Church) and the &quot;new town&quot; (north of Schwemmnotte river around Obermarkt and St. Mary&#x27;s Church). The former suburbiums of Mühlhausen are situated between the inner and the outer city walls. Like the inner city, they are of medieval origin, but in contrast from the core, this area was overbuilt often during the city&#x27;s later history and today shows a mixture of old and new buildings. Within the inner city walls, most buildings date back to the Middle Ages. In the late 19th and the 20th century, the city grew into all directions and a relatively low density of buildings is typical for Mühlhausen, so that the built-up area is very large in relation to the number of inhabitants.

Characteristic for Mühlhausen&#x27;s buildings is the predominant use of one kind of material – Travertine. It was found near the city in large quantities and is both light and solid, so that the Gothic churches with their filigree masonries and other important buildings could be built relatively cheaply. Nevertheless, many older citizens&#x27; houses were half-timbered constructions, with only the ground-floors made of stone.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches and synagogue ====
Mühlhausen is primarily known for its large number of intact Gothic churches:

===== Inside the inner city walls =====
* &quot;St. Blaise&#x27;s Church&quot; is the main church of the medieval Old Town at Untermarkt. It was built during the 13th century in early-Gothic style and is one of the most important 13th-century church buildings in Germany. It was first mentioned in 1227. The Teutonic Knights, owners of the church, had it expanded after 1270 using architects/builders from Maulbronn and Walkenried. Johann Sebastian Bach worked here in 1707–1708 as organist. Today, it is the main Lutheran parish church of Mühlhausen.
* &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Church&quot; is the main church of the medieval New Town at Obermarkt. It was built in the early 14th century in high-Gothic style and is Thuringia&#x27;s second-largest church after Erfurt Cathedral, sporting Thuringia&#x27;s highest steeple (). In 1975, the church was deconsecrated and is used as a museum today.
* &quot;All Saints Church&quot; at Steinweg was built in the late 13th century and has been a museum since 1989. 
* &quot;St. Anthony&#x27;s Chapel&quot; at Holzstraße was built in the 13th century and is a hostel today. 
* &quot;Corn Market Church&quot; at Kornmarkt was built as a Franciscanian monastery c. 1250. The monastery was abandoned in 1568. In 1702–22 the church was redesigned in the baroque style. The last service was held here in 1802 after which the church became a warehouse. Since 1975 it has been used as a museum. 
* &quot;St. James&#x27;s Church&quot; at Jakobistraße was built in the 14th century and hosts the city library today. 
* &quot;St. Kilian&#x27;s Church&quot; at Kiliansgraben was built during the 14th/15th century and hosts a theatre today. 
* &quot;St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Church&quot; between Steinweg and Mönchgasse was the church of the Dominican monastery, built in the early 14th century and demolished after a fire in 1689. Today, there are only a few walls remaining.

===== Outside the inner city walls =====
* &quot;St. George&#x27;s Church&quot; at Sondershäuser Straße was built in the 14th century and is a Protestant parish church today. 
* &quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Church&quot; at Kiliansgraben was built in the 14th century and is a Protestant parish church today. 
* &quot;St. Nicholas&#x27; Church&quot; at Bastmarkt is a Protestant parish church and was built in the early 14th century in Gothic style as the largest church outside the inner city walls. 
* &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Church&quot; at Petristeinweg was built between 1352 and 1356 and is a Protestant parish church today. 
* &quot;St. Boniface&#x27;s Church&quot; at Blobach was built in 1851 in Gothic Revival style and hosts a Catholic kindergarten today. 
* &quot;St. Joseph&#x27;s Church&quot; at Karl-Marx-Straße was built in 1903/04 in Gothic Revival style. Today, it is the Catholic parish church.

===== Synagogue =====
The Mühlhausen Synagogue at Jüdenstraße was first mentioned in 1380. Today&#x27;s building is of younger origin: it was established in 1840/41 after the emancipation of the Jews in Prussia. The Synagogue was damaged during the pogrom of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, but it was one of only a few in Germany that survived the Nazi period and World War II. In 1998, it was reconsecrated and it is in use by the Jewish Community of Thuringia. It is also open for visitors.

==== Secular buildings ====

* The &quot;inner city walls&quot; were built during the 12th century with a length of , a height of and a thickness of . They are mostly intact, with the exception of most of the gates, laid down during the 19th century to improve traffic access. The only existing gates are the &quot;Frauentor&quot; in the west (inner and outer one), out of an original total of 23 gates. Next to the inner Frauentor stands the &quot;Rabenturm&quot;, which is accessible via the &quot;Wehrgang-Museum&quot;. 
* The &quot;Rathaus&quot; (town hall) at Ratsstraße is unusual, because it is not located in a square, not even on a main street but more inside a city block. It stretches across Ratsstraße with an arch. It was built after 1310 and several times expanded on until 1596.
* The &quot;Brotlaube&quot; (bread storage) is a large building at Obermarkt, first mentioned in 1304 and rebuilt after a fire in 1689. It was the market hall of the bakers. The façade mainly dates to 1722.
* The Order of the Teutonic Knights had two courts in Mühlhausen. The one in the old town at Untermarkt was rebuilt in 1720 and hosts the superintendenture today. The one in the new town next to St. Mary&#x27;s Church was rebuilt during the 16th century. It was the residence of Thomas Müntzer and later the birthplace of Friedrich August Stüler. 
* The &quot;Pfafferode Hospital&quot; is a large hospital complex within a park, built between 1910 and 1917 at the western edge of the city and is a typical example of the early-20th-century sanatorium architecture in Germany. 
* The &quot;Brunnenhaus Popperode&quot; is a small Renaissance building in the south-western periphery of Mühlhausen, built in 1614. The well was first mentioned in 1199 as part of the medieval city&#x27;s water supply.
* There are also many architecturally interesting citizens&#x27; and patricians&#x27; houses within the centre of Mühlhausen, especially along the Steinweg street and at the Untermarkt square.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved: the unemployment rate in the Unstrut-Hainich district declined from 21% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with higher rates in the city than in the bordering rural municipalities. Still, Mühlhausen itself has one of the highest unemployment rates in Thuringia.

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture still plays an important role in the Mühlhausen region today. Approximately 55% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, mostly for growing cereals and vegetables. The region is a centre of the food industry in Germany, especially in the production of conserves like pickles, sauerkraut, apple sauce, cherries and other fruits and vegetables. A well-known product is the &quot;Mühlhäuser Pflaumenmus&quot; (Mühlhausian plum jam), which has been produced here since 1908.

Production of textiles, machines and electrical engineering were major manufacturing industries in Mühlhausen. Nevertheless, most factories were closed after German reunification in 1990. Since that time, Mühlhausen has had some problems finding a new economic core. Compared to other cities in Thuringia, the economic situation is relatively poor. In 2012, there were only 23 companies with more than 20 workers in the industrial sector, employing a total of 1,800 persons and generating an annual turnover of €314 million.

As district capital, Mühlhausen is a regional service hub in retail, health care, cinemas, education, government etc. One of the largest employers was the Bundeswehr, but the closure of the barracks in 2015 lead to a loss of more than 800 jobs in the city. Tourism does not play an important role yet, although the city has many historic sights and the Hainich National Park is only away. In 2012, there were 52,000 overnight visitors staying for a total of 118,000 nights in Mühlhausen.

=== Transport ===

Mühlhausen is connected to the railway by a station at the Gotha–Leinefelde line, opened in 1870. There are some regional express trains to Göttingen and to Zwickau/Glauchau (via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera) running every two hours and some local trains to Leinefelde and Erfurt (unlike the express via Kühnhausen), running every one to two hours. Former local railway connections to Sondershausen in the east and Treffurt in the west were discontinued.

Mühlhausen is the largest city in Thuringia without a direct connection to the Autobahn. The Bundesautobahn 4 near Eisenach is to the south and the Bundesautobahn 38 near Leinefelde is to the north. The connection to the city is via the Bundesstraße 247 (which is the most important route) to Leinefelde in the north and Bad Langensalza (with further connection to Erfurt and Gotha) in the south, the Bundesstraße 249 to Eschwege in the west and Sondershausen in the east and secondary roads to Bleicherode in the north, Eisenach in the south and Küllstedt in the north-west. Municipal traffic is mainly via the ring road along the inner city walls, where the load is high on the eastern side at Kiliansgraben. Therefore, a bypass road east around Mühlhausen is in planning to keep the transit traffic out of the city. This is part of a larger set of measures to improve the connections of Mühlhausen by extending the B 247 between Leinefelde, Mühlhausen and Bad Langensalza.

The next local airport is the Erfurt-Weimar Airport, approximately to the south-east and the next major airport is the Frankfurt Airport, approximately to the south-west.

Biking is getting more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. The &quot;Unstrut Trail&quot; and the &quot;Unstrut-Werra Trail&quot; are long-distance biking trails. Both connect points of touristic interest, the former along the Unstrut river from the Eichsfeld north-west of Mühlhausen to the Saale river near Naumburg, the latter on an abandoned railway track through the Hainich hills from Mühlhausen to Treffurt in the Werra valley.

The Mühlhausen tramway network was established in 1898 and discontinued in 1969. Since that time, there has been a bus network for local transport within the city and to neighbouring communities.

=== Education ===
There are two &quot;Gymnasiums&quot; in Mühlhausen: one state-run and one Protestant. There was a school of education in Mühlhausen until 1990, when it was merged into the later University of Erfurt.

== Politics ==

===Mayor and city council===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Hans-Dieter Dörbaum, who served from 1990 to 2012. Since 2012, Johannes Bruns of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) has been mayor. The most recent mayoral election was held on 15 April 2018, and the results were as follows:

<text>Antony Bek (also spelled Beck and Beke; c.1245 – 3 March 1311) was a bishop of Durham and the Patriarch of Jerusalem.

==Early life==

Bek and his elder brother Thomas Bek were members of a family of knights. Their father was Walter Bek, who held lands at Eresby in Lincolnshire. Another brother was John Beke, 1st Baron Beke of Eresby, who held the family lands in Eresby. Walter had married Eve, the niece of Walter de Gray, Archbishop of York. Bek was born about 1245 and was Walter&#x27;s third son. Both Thomas and Antony were educated at Oxford University, where they studied from 1267 to 1270.

Having entered the clergy, Bek received several benefices and soon attracted the attention of the Lord Edward, the heir of King Henry III of England. He was Archdeacon of Durham by 1275, as well as precentor of York and held prebends at Lichfield, London, and Wells. Bek accompanied Edward when the prince went on Crusade in 1270. When Edward returned from crusading, he appointed Bek to the office of Keeper of the wardrobe on 21 September 1274, but Bek held the office for only about a month, and was replaced in October with his brother Thomas Bek. Edward named Bek the constable of the Tower of London in 1275. In November 1277 Bek was one of the councillors sent by Edward to negotiate with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. The result was the Treaty of Aberconwy which required Llywelyn to give up hostages, pay a large fine, give up claims to some lands and pay homage to King Edward. Bek was also sent to Aragon to negotiate the marriage of Edward&#x27;s daughter Eleanor to the heir of Aragon, Alfonso.

==Bishop of Durham==
Edward I secured Bek&#x27;s election as bishop of Durham in 1283. He was elected on 9 July 1283 and consecrated on 9 January 1284. During his consecration, Bek had the remains of Saint William of York moved to a new shrine in York Minster. Bek was enthroned at Durham Cathedral on 25 December 1285. Bek was sent to Scotland after the death of King Alexander III of Scotland in 1286, to act on Edward&#x27;s behalf for Alexander&#x27;s heir Margaret of Norway, who was bethrothed to Edward&#x27;s son Prince Edward. However, Margaret died soon after this, and Edward was brought in to decide the succession of the Scottish throne. Bek was employed by King Edward in the negotiations and also served as a spokesman. In November 1292, Edward decided in favor of John Balliol, and Bek assisted in the enthronement of Balliol at Scone soon after.

==Service for Edward I==

In 1293, Bek was excommunicated by the Archbishop of York because Bek had allowed the king&#x27;s officers to arrest two clerks while Bek was in Scotland on a royal mission. In response, a legal case was brought against the archbishop in Parliament alleging that because Bek was acting as the king&#x27;s officer at the time, he wasn&#x27;t acting as bishop but as earl palatine, and thus the excommunication was actually an affront to the royal dignity. Before the case could be decided, the archbishop yielded and was fined. In 1294 the king sent Bek, along with others, on a diplomatic errand to the German king Adolf of Nassau and the archbishop of Cologne. The embassy was attempting to secure allies for Edward&#x27;s war against King Philip IV of France.
Taking part in Edward&#x27;s campaigns in Scotland, the bishop received the surrender of King John I of Scotland at Brechin in 1296, and led one division of the English army at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. During the Falkirk campaign, but before the battle itself, a section of the army under Bek captured Dirleton Castle.

In 1300, soon after his return to England, Bek became involved in a quarrel with Richard de Hoton, Prior of Durham and the cathedral chapter. Both Hoton and the chapter were attempting to assert their independence from oversight by the bishop. Bek deposed and excommunicated the prior, and locked the cathedral and the priory up. Appeals from both sides were made to the king, but the prior had previously secured the support of several of the king&#x27;s advisors. Attempts to secure a negotiated settlement failed, and other disputes over lands and rights escalated the dispute. At sometime after 1301 the king confiscated the lands of the bishop. A settlement in 1303 which restored the bishop&#x27;s lands, did not settle the dispute between the prior and the bishop. In 1304, further charges were brought against the bishop by the prior and the cathedral chapter, including a serious one of imprisoning a royal messenger. The issue of the messenger led to the lands of the bishop once more being confiscated in 1305. The bishop secured the support of Pope Clement V who named Bek Patriarch of Jerusalem on 26 February 1306. Further actions against the bishop were stopped by the death of the king in 1307.

==Service under Edward II==

Bek conducted the funeral service for King Edward I on 27 October 1307 at Westminster Abbey. In September, shortly after the death of Edward I, Edward II restored Bek&#x27;s lands and rights. Bek&#x27;s title of patriarch made him the senior ecclesiastic in England, and it was probably due to that status that he was named the main investigator of the Templars in 1308. In 1309, he finally managed to visit the priory at Durham, and the new prior announced that he and the chapter would not institute any more legal proceedings against the bishop stemming from the dispute.

==Death and legacy==

The bishop died at Eltham Palace near London on 3 March 1311. He was buried on 3 May 1311 in Durham Cathedral. Bek served as an important advisor to King Edward I throughout most of his term as bishop, only losing that status at the end of Edward&#x27;s reign due to the dispute with the Durham prior. His extravagance was legendary, and his retinue was large, and consisted of 140 knights. Bek was a wealthy man, and his personal estate at his death was valued at 6000 marks. He built at Auckland Castle, Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. He also built Durham Castle&#x27;s Great Hall. Some efforts were made after the bishop&#x27;s death to have him canonized, but nothing came of these efforts. Bek was known for his chastity and bravery also.

Bek&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas Bek was Bishop of St David&#x27;s and a trusted servant of Edward I. Two other relations were Thomas Bek, who was Bishop of Lincoln, and Antony Bek, who was Bishop of Norwich.

<doc id="1120319" wikidata="Q2246779" url="?curid=1120319" title="Japanese warship Shōhei Maru">
<text>was a sailing frigate constructed on orders of the Tokugawa shogunate of Bakumatsu period Japan by Satsuma Domain in response to the Perry Expedition and increasing incursions of foreign warships into Japanese territorial waters. She was built from 1853 to 1854 at Sakurajima in what is now Kagoshima Prefecture.
&quot;Shōhei Maru&quot; should not be confused with the World War II passenger/cargo vessel of the same name, sunk by the submarine off Korea.

==Background==
Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate ruling Japan pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the Dutch and the Chinese and was conducted exclusively at Nagasaki under a strict government monopoly. No foreigners were allowed to set foot in Japan, and no Japanese was permitted to travel abroad. In June 1635 a law was proclaimed prohibiting the construction of large, ocean-capable vessels. However, by the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1846, an official American expedition led by Commodore James Biddle visited on an official mission with two ships, including one warship armed with 72 cannons, asking for ports to be opened for trade, but his requests for a trade agreement were refused.

Following the July 1853 visit of Commodore Perry, an intense debate erupted within the Japanese government on how to handle the unprecedented threat to the nation’s capital, and the only universal consensus was that steps be taken immediately to bolster Japan’s coastal defenses. The law forbidding construction of large vessels was repealed, and many of the feudal domains took immediate steps to construct or purchase warships. These included the &quot;Hōō Maru&quot; constructed by the &quot;Uraga bugyō&quot; office, and the &quot;Asahi Maru&quot; constructed by Mito Domain.

Citing the need to protect Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, Satsuma &quot;daimyō&quot; Shimazu Nariakira successfully petitioned the Tokugawa shogunate to lift the prohibition on the construction of large ocean-going vessels in December 1852. A shipyard was constructed on Sakurajima and the new vessel was launched in May 1853 even before the July 1853 visit of Commodore Perry, and his fleet of &quot;Black Ships&quot; to Edo Bay.

&quot;Shōhei Maru&quot; took longer to complete than was anticipated, and was commissioned on December 12, 1854, almost six months after &quot;Hōō Maru&quot; was completed.

==Design==
&quot;Shōhei Maru&quot; was a three-masted barque-rigged sailing vessel, with an overall length of , beam of , and displacement of 370 tons. Of wooden construction, she was depicted in contemporary artwork as being armed with five cannon on each beam. Her sails had black bands, characteristic of Tokugawa naval vessels. She was depicted in an 1855 print as flying the rising sun flag. The new ship was apparently built using manuals obtained from the Netherlands via the trading outpost of Dejima, and occasional observations of foreign vessels roaming the waters off Japan. Nakahama Manjirō may have contributed to its design from his personal experiences, but this is uncertain.

==Service record==
&quot;Shōhei Maru&quot; was transferred to Edo in February 1855 and commissioned into the Tokugawa shogunate navy in August 1855. It was later assigned to the Nagasaki Naval Training Center as a training vessel.

Following the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, &quot;Shōhei Maru&quot; was seized by the new Meiji government, but was considered too obsolete for use by the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy and was assigned to the Colonization Ministry together with the &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; and as a transport for the development of the northern island of Hokkaidō. She was wrecked after she ran aground on a sandbar off what is now Kaminokuni, Hokkaidō () after a storm on 2 March 1870.

<doc id="1120331" wikidata="Q7728404" url="?curid=1120331" title="The Cunning Man">
<text>The Cunning Man, published by McClelland and Stewart in 1994, is the last novel written by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies.

&quot;The Cunning Man&quot; is the memoir of the life of a doctor, Dr. Jonathan Hullah, living in Toronto. Hullah is a holistic physician — a &quot;cunning&quot; diagnostician who can often get to the root of problems that have baffled others. A young journalist&#x27;s query about the circumstances surrounding an Anglican priest&#x27;s death at the high altar on Good Friday leads Hullah to reflect on his own life and career.

As is typical in Davies&#x27; work, the novel&#x27;s themes are wide-ranging: miraculous cures, halitosis, cannibalism, medical solutions to literary mysteries, and more.

Dunstan Ramsay, the narrator of &quot;Fifth Business&quot; and a major character in Davies&#x27; Deptford Trilogy, makes a brief appearance here.

A fictionalised version of Toronto&#x27;s Church of St. Mary Magdalene features prominently.

Unlike most of Davies&#x27; previous novels, &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; was not part of a trilogy. However, there is some speculation that, had Davies lived long enough, this novel and his previous one, &quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot; (1991), would have been the first two volumes in another trilogy. For example, &quot;Gil&quot; Gilmartin, the narrator of &quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot;, reappears in &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; as Hullah&#x27;s godson. In fact, in his introduction to &quot;The Merry Heart&quot; (1996), a collection of Davies&#x27; writings published posthumously, Davies&#x27; publisher, Douglas Gibson, tells how Davies had been researching and preparing the novel which would have followed &quot;The Cunning Man&quot; and would have been the third in the series. Gibson speculates that this unfinished trilogy might have been called the &quot;Toronto Trilogy&quot;.

He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively canon of Rouen Cathedral, treasurer of Rouen, and archdeacon of Oxford. King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was translated to Rouen in late 1184.

When Richard I, King Henry&#x27;s son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the Third Crusade, but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between William Longchamp, the justiciar whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince John, Richard&#x27;s younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar&#x27;s expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard&#x27;s ransom on the king&#x27;s release in February 1194.

Coutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andely manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the castle of Gaillard on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard&#x27;s death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King Philip II of France. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.

==Early life==

Coutances was born in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice during the reign of King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy and ended up in Cornwall, that was a flattering invention on Gerald&#x27;s part. Coutances&#x27; family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.

Coutances was usually given the title of &quot;magister&quot;, which signified that he had received an education in a school; most likely he attended the schools of Paris. Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning, and considered him to be a talented courtier.

==Service to King Henry==

Coutances started his career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He probably owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.

By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a group of royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, Walter Map, Ralph Diceto, John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Coutances was the chaplain to Henry the Young King, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry&#x27;s service. He became Archdeacon of Oxford, perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became Chancellor of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there. This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances&#x27; part comes from Arnulf&#x27;s correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, it does not appear that the attempt was a sustained one.

On his return to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of Wilton and Ramsey, which were being held by King Henry pending the election of new abbots. He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys&#x27; revenues in the name of the king, who had the regalian rights to that income. In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission. In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II&#x27;s will, made before the king travelled to Normandy.

==Bishop of Lincoln and Archbishop of Rouen==

Coutances was elected to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183, selected by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183. While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances&#x27; time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.

On 17 November 1184 Coutances was translated to the diocese of Rouen, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen had taken place in the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter&#x27;s nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances&#x27; ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry&#x27;s service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10 years of Henry&#x27;s reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the constable, equalled the 16 charters that Coutances witnessed.

In the later part of 1186, after the death of King Henry&#x27;s son Geoffrey—who was Duke of Brittany—King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey&#x27;s daughters be placed in the French king&#x27;s custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be surrendered into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.

At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was a member of a commission appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard&#x27;s conflict stemmed from Richard&#x27;s desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip&#x27;s sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry&#x27;s heir, and that Richard&#x27;s youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate&#x27;s threat of an interdict on France.

==Service to King Richard==

Shortly after Richard took the throne he sought absolution for his sins in rebelling against his father, from Baldwin of Forde and Coutances. The two archbishops absolved Richard in a ceremony in Sées. Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy in a ceremony held in Rouen, before accompanying Richard to England, where he participated in the new king&#x27;s coronation, on 3 September 1189.

In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated, among other things, that the clergy should not hold secular offices, even though Coutances himself had held and continued to hold such offices. On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Forde and the monks of his cathedral chapter over Baldwin&#x27;s plan to create a church dedicated to Thomas Becket, the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this church not with monks, but with canons. The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin&#x27;s plan, fearing that it was part of a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church&#x27;s canons. Sitting on the commission with Coutances were Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Godfrey de Lucy, the Bishop of Winchester, Hubert Walter, the Bishop of Salisbury, Peter de Leia, the Bishop of St David&#x27;s, Richard fitzNigel, the Bishop-elect of London, William Longchamp, the Bishop-elect of Ely, and some abbots. The commission travelled to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, managed to secure a compromise between the parties, which lasted until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, revived the plan. In the compromise, Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop&#x27;s authority.

When Richard left England in late 1189, the archbishop accompanied him to Normandy and then to Sicily, where Richard began the Third Crusade. In October 1190, Coutances was one of the negotiators between the city of Messina and the crusaders, and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between King Richard and Tancred, the King of Sicily. The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army.

While Richard was still in Sicily, word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard&#x27;s younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome, where Coutances received a release from his crusading vow. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp&#x27;s grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard&#x27;s bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20 years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances&#x27; if the archbishop&#x27;s advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been. Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king&#x27;s interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances.

==Acting Justiciar==
After Longchamp&#x27;s exile Coutances was named head of a council of regency, which is sometimes equated to the post of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document. Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar. He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.

Coutances had long experience in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard&#x27;s ransom. As evidence of this emphasis on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices from a wide range of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerant rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances&#x27; successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.

A new note in Coutances&#x27; administration was his custom of issuing writs not in his own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king&#x27;s name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent of many of the leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp&#x27;s authoritarian method of government.

The archbishop supervised the election of a new Archbishop of Canterbury, as Baldwin of Forde had died while on Crusade in 1190. Although both Longchamp and Coutances were considered as possible candidates and rivals for the see, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury elected the Bishop of Bath, Reginald fitzJocelin, in November 1191. Reginald died a month later and the see remained vacant until March 1193, when the king&#x27;s candidate, Hubert Walter, was elected.

During 1191 the citizens of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard&#x27;s captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard&#x27;s lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John&#x27;s men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.

In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at the court of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the outstanding portion of Richard&#x27;s ransom, and the king was released. The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 marks for his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and spent the rest of his career on Norman affairs. His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king&#x27;s English charters, but not after 1194.

==Return to Normandy==

Coutances returned to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure compensation for the losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that the conditions of the treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop&#x27;s punishment was valid.

When Coutances returned to his diocese in July 1196, he found that the king had seized the manor of Andely independently of the treaty provisions, and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king, Richard began to fortify the manor. He also built a castle there, now Château Gaillard. On 7 November 1196, Coutances set off for Rome, to protest the seizure to the pope. Richard sent a royal embassy, and eventually a settlement was reached. The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy, and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of Dieppe. The various lands that Coutances&#x27; received in exchange for Andely were worth £1,405 a year. This episode marked the end of Coutances&#x27; service to the Angevin kings; for the rest of his life the archbishop focused on protecting and guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights.

==Service to King John==

When Richard died on 6 April 1199, the archbishop invested Richard&#x27;s youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged to protect the Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of the archbishop to some jurisdictional rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy.

In September 1201 one of Coutances&#x27; suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of Sées died. King John objected when the cathedral chapter attempted to elect one of their own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of Sées, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king&#x27;s choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sées.

In May 1202, Pope Innocent III wrote to Coutances, urging him to impose religious punishments on any rebels against King John&#x27;s rule in the duchy of Normandy. When John lost the duchy in 1204, Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II, although he did not make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207. In 1206/07, Coutances, along with his suffragan bishops, petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage, which Philip granted.

==As archbishop==

Although Coutances was absent from Rouen for most of the period between 1190 and 1194, he remained an active archbishop. He secured the continued immunity of clergy from secular jurisdiction, and supervised the administration of the archdiocese. He began the custom of keeping records in registers of episcopal judgements from about 1200, and he appointed the first officials of Rouen. He also oversaw the rebuilding of Rouen Cathedral, which had begun in 1155, and restarted the work after a fire in 1200. His relations with his cathedral chapter were evidently excellent, as they remembered him as &quot;a magnificent benefactor of the church of Rouen&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and was buried at Rouen Cathedral, in the chapel of Saints Peter and Paul. The inventory of his personal possessions made after his death included a large number of jewels and vestments. He also owned a large library, which contained not only religious works but also legal texts on canon law and works of classical authors such as Juvenal and Ovid.

Coutances&#x27; nephew, John of Coutances, became Archdeacon of Oxford and Dean of Rouen under Walter&#x27;s influence, and later Bishop of Worcester. Other nephews were William, successively a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen, and Richard, also an archdeacon at Rouen.

The historian John Gillingham called Coutances &quot;one of the great fixers&quot; of his time. Two other historians have argued that it was probably Coutances&#x27; judgement and stability that persuaded the king to trust him. The medieval poet John of Hauville dedicated a satirical poem in 1184 to Coutances called Architrenius. It was on the tribulations of a poor scholar.

<text>Jean Broc (1771–1850) was a French neoclassical painter. His most famous work, &quot;The Death of Hyacinthos&quot;, was completed and exhibited at the Salon in 1801.

Hyacinthus was a young male beauty and lover of the god Apollo. One day, while playing with a discus, Hyachinthus was struck with the object and consequently died. The painting depicts Apollo&#x27;s mourning for his dead lover. Some myths link a jealous Zephyr to the incident, blaming his jealousy of Hyacinthus for a gust of wind resulting in the youth&#x27;s death.

Broc studied under Jacques-Louis David and is well known for the cultivation of the intellectual group known as &quot;Les Primitifs&quot; (a.k.a., Barbus or &quot;The Bearded Ones&quot;).

<text>The Whitby Gazette is an English provincial newspaper published in Whitby, North Yorkshire.

==History==

The &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot; was founded on 6 July 1854 by Ralph Horne, a local printer, bookseller, stationer, bookbinder, paperhanger and shipowner, who was also a member of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society. It was originally published as the Whitby Gazette: Horne&#x27;s List of Visitors, and was little more than a list of visitors to the seaside town. However, on 2 January 1858, it became a proper twice-weekly newspaper, published on Tuesday and Friday each week.

On the death of Ralph Horne in 1892, his two sons, H. S. &quot;Mr Harry&quot; Horne and F. W. &quot;Mr Fred&quot; Horne had taken over as Editor and Chairman respectively. In 1920, &quot;Mr Harry&quot; Horne retired and one of &quot;Mr Fred&quot; Horne&#x27;s sons, William Mackenzie Horne, took over the editorship between the wars. In 1949, &quot;Mr Fred&quot; Horne died thereby relinquishing the Chairmanship, and William Mackenzie&#x27;s son, L. M. &quot;Mr Lionel&quot; Horne, took over the running of the entire business. The &quot;Gazette&quot; stopped being privately owned by the Horne family on 30 March 1978, when Lionel Horne, the great grandson of Ralph Horne, died.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; briefly experimented with a paywall, but this was quickly abandoned as the number of subscribers remained low. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was re-launched as weekly edition in January 2012 and the paper is now published on a Friday. It is published by Yorkshire Regional Newspapers Ltd, part of Johnston Press.

Editor: Ed Asquith Editorial Director since 2003 (previously editor 1996-1998)

The &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot; is the only newspaper in the world to have been read on the highest mountain on each of the seven continents, thanks to the efforts of mountaineer Alistair Sutcliffe, who lives in a village near to the seaside port.

Lewis Carroll&#x27;s first ever published literary works, &quot;Coronach&quot; and the &quot;Lady of the Ladle&quot;, were published in the &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot; between 1854 and 1856.

==Awards==

In 2011 the editorial team was a finalist in the O2 Media Awards for the Yorkshire and Humber. In 2013 the &quot;Gazette&quot; was nominated for the 02 Media&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper of the Year award. In 2014 the newspaper was also JP Weekly Paper of the Year Runner-up. Winner Yorkshire best weekly newspaper O2 Awards winner 2017

<text>MKM steel, an alloy containing nickel and aluminum, was developed in 1931 by metallurgist Tokushichi Mishima (三島徳七). While conducting research into the properties of nickel, Mishima discovered that a strongly magnetic steel could be created by adding aluminum to non-magnetic nickel steel. 

==Characteristics==
The developers claim MKM steel is tough and durable, inexpensive to produce, maintains strong magnetism when miniaturized and can produce a stable magnetic force in spite of temperature changes or vibration. MKM steel is similar to Alnico.

<text>Kars ( or ; ; ) is a city in northeast Turkey. It is the seat of Kars Province and Kars District. As of 2022, its population was 91,450. Kars, in classical historiography (Strabo), was in the ancient region known as &quot;Chorzene&quot; (), part of the province of Ayrarat in the Kingdom of Armenia, and later the capital of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia from 929 to 961. Currently, the mayor of Kars is Türker Öksüz. The city had an Armenian ethnic majority until it was re-captured by Turkish nationalist forces in late 1920.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name may derive from the Armenian word , meaning &#x27;bride&#x27;. According to another hypothesis, the name derives from the Georgian word , meaning &#x27;gate&#x27;.

== History ==
===Medieval period===
Little is known of the early history of Kars beyond the fact that, during medieval times, it had its own dynasty of Armenian rulers and was the capital of a region known as Vanand. Medieval Armenian historians referred to the city by a variety of names, including (&#x27;Kars city&#x27;), , , (all meaning &#x27;Kars Fortress&#x27;). At some point in the ninth century (at least by 888) it entered into the domains of the Armenian Bagratunis. Kars was the capital of the Bagratid kingdom of Armenia between 929 and 961. During this period, the town&#x27;s cathedral, later known as the Church of the Holy Apostles, was built.

In 963, shortly after the Bagratuni seat was transferred to Ani, Kars became the capital of a separate independent kingdom, again called Vanand. However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani&#x27;s capture by the Byzantine Empire in 1045, the Bagratuni title &quot;King of Kings&quot; held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars.

In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by Alp Arslan (leader of the Seljuk Turks), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.

The Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the Saltukids in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing Georgian attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the Zakarids–Mkhargrdzeli succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani. It was conquered in 1242 by the Mongols and later Kars fell under Georgian influence. During the reign of David IX of Georgia, the Ilkhanate occupied the southern territories of the Kingdom of Georgia, which included Kars. By 1358, the city was ruled by the Jalayirids and in 1380 it fell to the Qara Qoyunlu. In 1387 the city was leveled and the surrounding countryside was devastated by Timur (Tamerlane). Anatolian beyliks followed for some time after that, until it firstly fell into the hands of the Qara Qoyunlu and subsequent Aq Qoyunlu. After the Ak Koyunlu, as it went naturally for almost all their former territories, the city fell into the hands of the newly established Safavid dynasty of Iran, founded by king Ismail I. Following the Peace of Amasya of 1555 that followed the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1533–1555, the city was declared neutral, and its existing fortress was destroyed. In 1585, during the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1579–1590, the Ottomans took the city alongside Tabriz. On June 8, 1604, during the next bout of hostilities between the two archrivals, the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1603–1618, Safavid ruler Abbas I retook the city from the Ottomans. The fortifications of the city were rebuilt by the Ottoman Sultan Murad III and were strong enough to withstand a siege by Nader Shah of Persia, in 1731. It became the head of a sanjak in the Ottoman Erzurum vilayet. In July 1744, the city was again besieged by Nader Shah. Later, in August 1745, a huge Ottoman army was routed at Kars by Nader Shah during the Ottoman–Persian War of 1743–1746. As a result, the Turks fled westwards, raiding their own lands as they went.

===Russian administration===

In 1807, Kars successfully resisted an attack by the Russian Empire. During a break between the Russian campaigns in the region conducted against the Ottomans, in 1821, commander-in-chief Abbas Mirza of Qajar Iran occupied Kars, further igniting the Ottoman–Persian War of 1821–1823. After another Russian siege in 1828 the city was surrendered by the Ottomans on June 23, 1828, to the Russian general Count Ivan Paskevich, 11,000 men becoming prisoners of war. At the end of the war it returned to Ottoman control for diplomatic reasons, Russia gaining only two border forts. During the Crimean War, an Ottoman garrison led by British officers, including General William Fenwick Williams, kept the Russians at bay during a protracted siege, but after the garrison had been devastated by cholera and food supplies were depleted, the town was surrendered to General Muravyov in November 1855.

The city&#x27;s significance increased as the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire contested its possession. The fortress was stormed by the Russians in the Battle of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78 under generals Loris-Melikov and Ivan Lazarev. Following the war, Kars was transferred to Russia by the Treaty of San Stefano. Kars became the capital of the Kars Okrug and larger Kars Oblast (&quot;region&quot;), comprising the &quot;okrugs&quot; (&quot;districts&quot;) of Kars, Ardahan, Kagizman, and Olti, which was the most southwesterly extension of the Russian Transcaucasus. In the following years the Russians supported the fortification of Kars.

From 1878 to 1881 more than 82,000 Muslims from formerly Ottoman-controlled territory migrated to the Ottoman Empire. Among those there were more than 11,000 people from the city of Kars. At the same time, many Armenians and Pontic Greeks (here usually called Caucasus Greeks) migrated to the region from the Ottoman Empire and other regions of Transcaucasia. According to the Russian census data, by 1897 Armenians formed 49.7%, Russians 26.3%, Caucasus Greeks 11.7%, Poles 5.3% and Turks 3.8%.

===World War I===
In the First World War, the city was one of the main objectives of the Ottoman army during the lost Battle of Sarikamish in the Caucasus Campaign. Russia ceded Kars, Ardahan and Batum to the Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918. However, by then Kars was under the effective control of Armenian and non-Bolshevik Russian forces. The Ottoman Empire captured Kars on 25 April 1918, but under the Armistice of Mudros (October 1918) was required to withdraw to the pre-war frontier and Kars came under control of the First Republic of Armenia. The Ottomans refused to relinquish Kars; its military governor instead established a government, the Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus, led by Fahrettin Pirioglu, that claimed Turkish sovereignty over Kars and Turkic-speaking regions as far as Batumi and Alexandropol (Gyumri). Much of the region fell under the administrative control of Armenia in January 1919 but the pro-Turkish government remained in the city until a joint operation launched by British and Armenian troops dissolved it on 19 April 1919, arresting its leaders and sending them to Malta. In May 1919, Kars came under the full administration of the Armenian Republic and became the capital of its Vanand province.

Skirmishes between the Turkish revolutionaries and Armenian border troops in Olti took place during the summer of 1920. In the autumn of that year four Turkish divisions under the command of General Kâzım Karabekir invaded the Armenian Republic, triggering the Turkish-Armenian War. Kars had been fortified to withstand a lengthy siege but, to the astonishment of all, was taken with little resistance by Turkish forces on 30 October 1920, in what some modern scholars have called one of the worst military fiascoes in Armenian history. The terms of the Treaty of Alexandropol, signed by the representatives of Armenia and Turkey on 2 December 1920, forced Armenia to give back all the Ottoman territories granted to it in the Treaty of Sèvres.

After the Bolshevik advance into Armenia, the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the Treaty of Kars (October 23, 1921), signed between Turkey and the Soviet Union. The treaty allowed for Soviet annexation of Adjara in exchange for Turkish control of the regions of Kars, Igdir, and Ardahan. The Treaty of Kars established peaceful relations between the two nations, but as early as 1939, some British diplomats noted indications that the Soviet Union was not satisfied with the established border. The Treaty of Kars, signed in 1921 by the Government of the Grand National Assembly and by the Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, established the current north-eastern boundaries of Turkey. The treaty included &quot;de jure&quot; provisions guaranteeing the Armenian residents right to relinquish Turkish nationality, leave the territory freely and take with them either their goods or the proceeds of their sale, but by some accounts formerly Armenian lands had &quot;de facto&quot; become state property as a consequence of the treaty.

===After World War II===
After World War II, the Soviet Union attempted to annul the Kars treaty and regain the Kars region and the adjoining region of Ardahan. On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow Selim Sarper that the regions should be returned to the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics. Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister Winston Churchill objected to these territorial claims, while President Harry Truman initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the Cold War, however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its claims to Kars and the other regions.

=== Recent history ===
In April 1993, Turkey closed its Kars border crossing with Armenia, in a protest against the capture of the Kelbajar district of Azerbaijan by Armenian forces during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Since then the land border between Armenia and Turkey has remained closed. In 2006, former Kars mayor Naif Alibeyoğlu said that opening the border would boost the local economy and reawaken the city. Despite unsuccessful attempts to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2009, there remained opposition and pressure from the local population against the re-opening of the border. Under pressure from Azerbaijan, and the local population, including the 20% ethnic Azerbaijani minority, the Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoğlu reiterated in 2010 and 2011 that opening the border with Armenia was out of the question. , the border remains closed.

The last elected mayor of Kars was Ayhan Bilgen of the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP), who was elected in 2019, and arrested and deposed in 2020. He was replaced by the governor of Kars Province, Eyüp Tepe, as a government-appointed trustee.

==Demographics==
According to Turkey&#x27;s 2011 Statistical Yearbook, the area has been depopulating because of migration to bigger cities. In Istanbul alone, there are 269,388 people from Kars, more than three times the city&#x27;s population.

Today, Kars has a mixed population of Azerbaijanis, Kurds and Turks.

The Azerbaijanis are mainly composed of the Terekeme and Qarapapaq sub-ethnic groups. The Shia Azerbaijanis make up 20% of the city&#x27;s population.

Most of the population in Kars is Sunni Muslim, mainly made up by the population of Kurds and Turks, and the minority is Shia Muslim, mainly among the Azerbaijanis.

==Government==
The present day ethnic make-up of Kars is also reflected in politics, with the Turks and Azerbaijanis often voting for the nationalist MHP and the Kurds often voting for the pro-Kurdish HDP. On 30 March 2014, Murtaza Karaçanta (MHP) was elected mayor. During the June 2015 elections, Kars was won by the pro-Kurdish HDP, becoming the largest political party in both the city and the province of Kars. The last elected mayor was Ayhan Bilgen from the HDP until he was deposed in October 2020.

== Climate ==
Kars has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb, Trewartha: Dcb&quot;). It experiences significant seasonal and diurnal temperature variation, due to its location away from large bodies of water, its high elevation and location, where the high plateau of Eastern Anatolia converges with the Lesser Caucasus mountain range.

Summers are generally brief and quite warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is .

Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is , and temperatures can plummet to during the winter months. Kars experiences frequent and sometimes heavy snowfall, with four months of snow cover on average.

Highest recorded temperature: on 24 August 2022&lt;br&gt;Lowestrecorded temperature: on 4 February 1947

== Sports ==
The town has a football club Kars S.K. Bandy, a sport which does not exist in Turkey today, was once played here.

== Education ==
Kars hosts the Kafkas University, which was established in 1992.

== Transport ==
Kars is served by a main highway from Erzurum, and lesser roads run north to Ardahan and south to Igdir. The town has an airport (Kars Harakani Airport), with daily direct flights to Ankara and Istanbul. Kars is served by a station on the Turkish Railways (TCDD) that links it to Erzurum. This line was originally laid when Kars was within the Russian Empire and connected the city to nearby Alexandropol and Tiflis, with a wartime, narrow-gauge extension running to Erzurum. Turkey&#x27;s border crossings with Armenia, including the rail link, the Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railway, have regrettably been closed since April 1993. Turkey&#x27;s border with Armenia was closed down after local Armenian forces occupied the Kalbajar District (adjacent to disputed Nagorno Karabakh) in Azerbaijan. (As of September 2018, Turkey maintains that the border will remain closed until Armenia ends its occupation). Construction on a new line, the Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway, intended to connect Turkey with Georgia and Azerbaijan, began in 2010. The line became operational on October 30, 2017. The line connects Kars to Akhalkalaki in Georgia, from where trains will continue to Tbilisi, and Baku in Azerbaijan.

==Places of interest==
===Kars Citadel===
The Castle of Kars (), also known as the Citadel, sits at the top a rocky hill overlooking Kars. Its walls date back to the Bagratuni Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the Zak&#x27;arid dynasty.

The walls bear crosses in several places, including a Khachkar with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by Ottoman Sultan Murad III during the war with Persia, at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably ordered the reconstruction of much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at Ardahan). During the eighteenth century, at the Battle of Kars (1745), a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.

By the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars – this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the Siege of Kars in 1855.

=== Other historical structures ===

Below the castle is a mosque, formerly the Armenian church known as Surb Arak&#x27;elots, the Church of the Holy Apostles. Built in the 930&#x27;s, it has a tetraconch plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum contains bas-relief depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russians built porches in front of the church&#x27;s three entrances, and an elaborate clocktower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.

The Grand Mosque of Kars is the largest historic mosque in the city. Built by the Seljuks, it was restored by the Ottomans in 1579.

The Taşköprü (Stone Bridge) is a bridge over the Kars River, built in 1725. Close to the bridge are three old bath-houses, none of them operating any longer.

As a settlement at the juncture of Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, Kurdish and Russian cultures, the buildings of Kars come in a variety of architectural styles. Most Russian-era buildings in Kars are identical in architectural style to those of Gyumri in Armenia. Orhan Pamuk in the novel &quot;Snow&quot;, set in Kars, makes repeated references to &quot;the Russian houses&quot;, built &quot;in a Baltic style&quot;, whose like cannot be seen anywhere else in Turkey, and deplores the deteriorating condition of these houses.

<text>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an interleukin, which is a type of cytokine signaling molecule forming part of the immune system. It is a 15.5–16 kDa protein that regulates the activities of white blood cells (leukocytes, often lymphocytes) that are responsible for immunity. IL-2 is part of the body&#x27;s natural response to microbial infection, and in discriminating between foreign (&quot;non-self&quot;) and &quot;self&quot;. IL-2 mediates its effects by binding to IL-2 receptors, which are expressed by lymphocytes. The major sources of IL-2 are activated CD4+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells. Put shortly the function of IL-2 is to stimulate the growth of helper, cytotoxic and regulatory T cells.
== IL-2 receptor ==

IL-2 is a member of a specific family of cytokines, each member of which has a four alpha helix bundle; this cytokine family also includes IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. IL-2 signals through a IL-2 receptor, a complex consisting of three chains, termed alpha (CD25), beta (CD122) and gamma (CD132). The gamma chain is common to all family members.

The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) α subunit binds IL-2 with low affinity (Kd~ 10−8 M). Interaction of IL-2 and CD25 alone does not lead to signal transduction due to its short intracellular chain but has the ability (when bound to the β and γ subunit) to increase the IL-2R affinity 100-fold. Heterodimerization of the β and γ subunits of IL-2R is essential for signalling in T cells. IL-2 can signalize either via intermediate-affinity dimeric CD122/CD132 IL-2R (Kd~ 10−9 M) or high-affinity trimeric CD25/CD122/CD132 IL-2R (Kd~ 10−11 M). Dimeric IL-2R is expressed by memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells, whereas regulatory T cells and activated T cells express high levels of trimeric IL-2R.

== IL-2 signaling pathways and regulation ==
Instructions to express proteins in response to an IL-2 signal (called IL-2 transduction) can take place via 3 different signaling pathways; they are: (1) the JAK-STAT pathway, (2) the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and (3) the MAPK/ERK pathway. The signalling is commenced by IL-2 binding to its receptor, following which cytoplasmatic domains of CD122 and CD132 heterodimerize. This leads to the activation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 which subsequently phosphorylate T338 on CD122. This phosphorylation recruits STAT transcription factors, predominantly STAT5, which dimerize and migrate to the cell nucleus where they bind to DNA. with an &quot;express other proteins&quot; signal. The proteins expressed by means of the three pathways include bcl-6 (the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway), CD25 &amp; prdm-1 (the JAK-STAT pathway) and certain cyclins (the MAPK/ERK pathway).

Gene expression regulation for IL-2 can be on multiple levels or by different ways. One of the checkpoints (in other words one of the things which needs to be done before IL-2 is expressed) is that there must be signaling through a conjunction of a T Cell Receptor (a TCR) and an HLA-peptide complex. As a result of that conjunction a signalling pathway (signalling a cell&#x27;s protein making machinery to express or &#x27;make&#x27; IL-2), a PhosphoLipase-C (PLC) dependent pathway, is set up. PLC activates 3 major transcription factors and their pathways: NFAT, NFkB and AP-1. In addition and after costimulation from CD28 the optimal activation of expression of IL-2 and these pathways is induced. In summary therefore before a cell will make IL-2 in accordance with this pathway there have to be two reactions: TCR+HLA and protein complex on the one hand and CD28 costimulation on the other indeed mere IL-2 ligation to its receptor is too low affinity to enable pathway.

At the same time Oct-1 is expressed. It helps the activation. Oct1 is expressed in T-lymphocytes and Oct2 is induced after cell activation.

NFAT has multiple family members, all of them are located in cytoplasm and signaling goes through calcineurin, NFAT is dephosphorylated and therefore translocated to the nucleus.

AP-1 is a dimer and is composed of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. It cooperates with other transcription factors including NFkB and Oct.

NFkB is translocated to the nucleus after costimulation through CD28. NFkB is a heterodimer and there are two binding sites on the IL-2 promoter.

== Function ==

IL-2 has essential roles in key functions of the immune system, tolerance and immunity, primarily via its direct effects on T cells. In the thymus, where T cells mature, it prevents autoimmune diseases by promoting the differentiation of certain immature T cells into regulatory T cells, which suppress other T cells that are otherwise primed to attack normal healthy cells in the body. IL-2 enhances activation-induced cell death (AICD). IL-2 also promotes the differentiation of T cells into effector T cells and into memory T cells when the initial T cell is also stimulated by an antigen, thus helping the body fight off infections. Together with other polarizing cytokines, IL-2 stimulates naive CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes while it impedes differentiation into Th17 and folicular Th lymphocytes.

IL-2 increases the cell killing activity of both natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells.

Its expression and secretion is tightly regulated and functions as part of both transient positive and negative feedback loops in mounting and dampening immune responses. Through its role in the development of T cell immunologic memory, which depends upon the expansion of the number and function of antigen-selected T cell clones, it plays a key role in enduring cell-mediated immunity.

== Evolution ==
IL-2 has been discovered in all classes of jawed vertebrates, including sharks, at a similar genomic location. In fish, IL-2 shares a single receptor alpha chain with its related cytokines IL-15 and IL-15-like (IL-15L). This &quot;IL-15Rα&quot; receptor chain is similar to mammalian IL-15Rα, and in tetrapod evolution a duplication of its coding gene plus further diversification created mammalian IL-2Rα. Sequences, and structural analysis of grass carp IL-2, suggest that fish IL-2 binds IL-15Rα in a manner reminiscent of how mammalian IL-15 binds to IL-15Rα.

Despite fish IL-2 and IL-15 sharing the same IL-15Rα chain, the stability of fish IL-2 is independent of it whereas IL-15 and especially IL-15L depend on binding to (co-presentation with) IL-15Rα for their stability and function. This suggests that, like in mammals, fish IL-2, in contrast to fish IL-15 and IL-15L, is not relying on &quot;in trans&quot; presentation by its receptor alpha chain. As a free cytokine, mammalian IL-2 that is secreted by activated T cells is important for a negative feedback loop by the stimulation of regulatory T cells, the latter being the cells with the highest constitutive IL-2Rα (aka CD25) expression. Besides this negative feedback loop, mammalian IL-2 also participates in a positive feedback loop because activated T cells enhance their own IL-2Rα expression. As in mammals, fish IL-2 also stimulates T cell proliferation and appears to preferentially stimulate regulatory T cells. Fish IL-2 induces the expression of cytokines of both type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) immunity.

As has been found in some studies on mammalian IL-2, data suggest that fish IL-2 can form homodimers and that this is an ancient property of the IL-2/15/15L-family cytokines.

Homologues of IL-2 have not been reported for jawless fish (hagfish and lamprey) or invertebrates.

== Role in disease ==

While the causes of itchiness are poorly understood, some evidence indicates that IL-2 is involved in itchy psoriasis.

== Medical use ==
=== Pharmaceutical analogues ===
Aldesleukin is a form of recombinant interleukin-2. It is manufactured using recombinant DNA technology and is marketed as a protein therapeutic and branded as Proleukin. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a black box warning and in several European countries for the treatment of cancers (malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer) in large intermittent doses and has been extensively used in continuous doses.

Interking is a recombinant IL-2 with a serine at residue 125, sold by Shenzhen Neptunus.

Neoleukin 2/15 is a computationally designed mimic of IL-2 that was designed to avoid common side effects. However, clinical trials into this candidate were discontinued.

==== Dosage ====
Various dosages of IL-2 across the United States and across the world are used. The efficacy and side effects of different dosages is often a point of disagreement.

The commercial interest in local IL-2 therapy has been very low. Because only a very low dose IL-2 is used, treatment of a patient would cost about $500 commercial value of the patented IL-2. The commercial return on investment is too low to stimulate additional clinical studies for the registration of intratumoral IL-2 therapy.

===== United States =====
Usually, in the U.S., the higher dosage option is used, affected by cancer type, response to treatment and general patient health. Patients are typically treated for five consecutive days, three times a day, for fifteen minutes. The following approximately 10 days help the patient to recover between treatments. IL-2 is delivered intravenously on an inpatient basis to enable proper monitoring of side effects.

A lower dose regimen involves injection of IL-2 under the skin typically on an outpatient basis. It may alternatively be given on an inpatient basis over 1–3 days, similar to and often including the delivery of chemotherapy.

Intralesional IL-2 is commonly used to treat in-transit melanoma metastases and has a high complete response rate.

==== Local application ====
In preclinical and early clinical studies, local application of IL-2 in the tumor has been shown to be clinically more effective in anticancer therapy than systemic IL-2 therapy, over a broad range of doses, without serious side effects.

Tumour blood vessels are more vulnerable than normal blood vessels to the actions of IL-2. When injected inside a tumor, i.e. local application, a process mechanistically similar to the vascular leakage syndrome, occurs in tumor tissue only. Disruption of the blood flow inside of the tumor effectively destroys tumor tissue.

In local application, the systemic dose of IL-2 is too low to cause side effects, since the total dose is about 100 to 1000 fold lower. Clinical studies showed painful injections at the site of radiation as the most important side effect, reported by patients. In the case of irradiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma the five-year disease-free survival increased from 8% to 63% by local IL-2 therapy 

====Toxicity====
Systemic IL-2 has a narrow therapeutic window, and the level of dosing usually determines the severity of the side effects. In the case of local IL-2 application, the therapeutic window spans several orders of magnitude.

Some common side effects:
* flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue)
* nausea/vomiting
* dry, itchy skin or rash
* weakness or shortness of breath
* diarrhea
* low blood pressure
* drowsiness or confusion
* loss of appetite

More serious and dangerous side effects sometimes are seen, such as breathing problems, serious infections, seizures, allergic reactions, heart problems, kidney failure or a variety of other possible complications. The most common adverse effect of high-dose IL-2 therapy is vascular leak syndrome (VLS; also termed capillary leak syndrome). It is caused by lung endothelial cells expressing high-affinity IL-2R. These cells, as a result of IL-2 binding, causes increased vascular permeability. Thus, intravascular fluid extravasate into organs, predominantly lungs, which leads to life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema.

Other drawbacks of IL-2 cancer immunotherapy are its short half-life in circulation and its ability to predominantly expand regulatory T cells at high doses.

Intralesional IL-2 used to treat in-transit melanoma metastases is generally well tolerated. This is also the case for intralesional IL-2 in other forms of cancer, like nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

=== Pharmaceutical derivative ===
Eisai markets a drug called denileukin diftitox (trade name Ontak), which is a recombinant fusion protein of the human IL-2 ligand and the diphtheria toxin. This drug binds to IL-2 receptors and introduces the diphtheria toxin into cells that express those receptors, killing the cells. In some leukemias and lymphomas, malignant cells express the IL-2 receptor, so denileukin diftitox can kill them. In 1999 Ontak was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL).

== Preclinical research ==
IL-2 does not follow the classical dose-response curve of chemotherapeutics. The immunological activity of high and low dose IL-2 show sharp contrast. This might be related to different distribution of IL-2 receptors (CD25, CD122, CD132) on different cell populations, resulting in different cells that are activated by high and low dose IL-2. In general high doses are immune suppressive, while low doses can stimulate type 1 immunity. Low-dose IL-2 has been reported to reduce hepatitis C and B infection.

IL-2 has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic viral infections and as a booster (adjuvant) for vaccines. The use of large doses of IL-2 given every 6–8 weeks in HIV therapy, similar to its use in cancer therapy, was found to be ineffective in preventing progression to an AIDS diagnosis in two large clinical trials published in 2009.

More recently low dose IL-2 has shown early success in modulating the immune system in disease like type 1 diabetes and vasculitis. There are also promising studies looking to use low dose IL-2 in ischaemic heart disease.

=== IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb immune complexes (IL-2 ic) ===
IL-2 cannot accomplish its role as a promising immunotherapeutic agent due to significant drawbacks which are listed above. Some of the issues can be overcome using IL-2 ic. They are composed of IL-2 and some of its monoclonal antibody (mAb) and can potentiate biologic activity of IL-2 &quot;in vivo&quot;. The main mechanism of this phenomenon &quot;in vivo&quot; is due to the prolongation of the cytokine half-life in circulation. Depending on the clone of IL-2 mAb, IL-2 ic can selectively stimulate either CD25high (IL-2/JES6-1 complexes), or CD122high cells (IL-2/S4B6). IL-2/S4B6 immune complexes have high stimulatory activity for NK cells and memory CD8+ T cells and they could thus replace the conventional IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy. On the other hand, IL-2/JES6-1 highly selectively stimulate regulatory T cells and they could be potentially useful for transplantations and in treatment of autoimmune diseases.

== History==

According to an immunology textbook: &quot;IL-2 is particularly important historically, as it is the first type I cytokine that was cloned, the first type I cytokine for which a receptor component was cloned, and was the first short-chain type I cytokine whose receptor structure was solved. Many general principles have been derived from studies of this cytokine including its being the first cytokine demonstrated to act in a growth factor–like fashion through specific high-affinity receptors, analogous to the growth factors being studied by endocrinologists and biochemists&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, studies reported &quot;activities&quot; in leukocyte-conditioned media that promoted lymphocyte proliferation. In the mid-1970s, it was discovered that T-cells could be selectively proliferated when normal human bone marrow cells were cultured in conditioned medium obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes. The key factor was isolated from cultured mouse cells in 1979 and from cultured human cells in 1980. The gene for human IL-2 was cloned in 1982 after an intense competition.

Commercial activity to bring an IL-2 drug to market was intense in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1983, Cetus Corporation had created a proprietary recombinant version of IL-2 (Aldesleukin, later branded as Proleukin), with the alanine removed from its N-terminal and residue 125 replaced with serine. Amgen later entered the field with its own proprietary, mutated, recombinant protein and Cetus and Amgen were soon competing scientifically and in the courts; Cetus won the legal battles and forced Amgen out of the field. By 1990 Cetus had gotten aldesleukin approved in nine European countries but in that year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to approve Cetus&#x27; application to market IL-2. The failure led to the collapse of Cetus, and in 1991 the company was sold to Chiron Corporation. Chiron continued the development of IL-2, which was finally approved by the FDA as Proleukin for metastatic renal carcinoma in 1992.

By 1993 aldesleukin was the only approved version of IL-2, but Roche was also developing a proprietary, modified, recombinant IL-2 called teceleukin, with a methionine added at is N-terminal, and Glaxo was developing a version called bioleukin, with a methionine added at is N-terminal and residue 125 replaced with alanine. Dozens of clinical trials had been conducted of recombinant or purified IL-2, alone, in combination with other drugs, or using cell therapies, in which cells were taken from patients, activated with IL-2, then reinfused. Novartis acquired Chiron in 2006 and licensed the US aldesleukin business to Prometheus Laboratories in 2010 before global rights to Proleukin were subsequently acquired by Clinigen in 2018 and 2019.

<text>Ralph de Diceto or Ralph of Diss (; ) was archdeacon of Middlesex, dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (from ), and the author of a major chronicle divided into two partsoften treated as separate worksthe &#x27; (Latin for &quot;Abbreviations of Chronicles&quot;) from the birth of Jesus to the 1140s and the &#x27; or  (&quot;Images of Histories&quot;) from that point until 1202.
==Life==
Ralph is first mentioned in 1152, when he received the archdeaconry of Middlesex in London. He was probably born between 1120 and 1130. Of his parentage and nationality, we know nothing. The common statement that he derived his surname from Diss in Norfolk is a mere conjecture. may equally well be a Latinized form of Dissay, Dicy, or Dizy, place names in Maine, Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne.

In 1152, Ralph was already a Master of Arts and, presumably, had studied at Paris. His reputation for learning and integrity stood high. He was regarded with respect and favor by Arnulf of Lisieux and Gilbert Foliot, two of the most eminent bishops of their time. Quite naturally, the archdeacon assumed the same side on the Becket controversythat of King HenryIIas did his friends.

By 1164, Ralph had acquired the livings of Aynho in Northamptonshire and Finchingfield in Essex, serving them both by vicars.

Although Ralph&#x27;s narrative is colourless and although he was one of those who showed some sympathy for Becket at the Council of Northampton in 1164, his correspondence shows that he regarded the archbishop&#x27;s conduct as ill considered and that he gave advice to those whom Becket regarded as his chief enemies.

The natural impartiality of his intellect was accentuated by a certain timidity, which is apparent in his writings no less than in his life. Apart from his selection in 1166 as the envoy of the English bishops when they protested against the excommunications launched by Becket, which he characteristically neglects to record, he remained in the background.

About 1180, Ralph became dean of St Paul&#x27;s. In this office, he distinguished himself by careful management of its estates, by restoring the discipline of its chapter, and by building a deanery house at his own expense. A scholar and a man of considerable erudition, he evinced a strong preference for historical studies. About the time he was preferred to the deanery, he began to collect materials for the history of his own times.

Ralph&#x27;s friendships with Richard FitzNeal, who succeeded Gilbert Foliot in the see of London; with William Longchamp, the chancellor of King RichardI; and with Walter de Coutances, the archbishop of Rouen in Normandy, gave him excellent opportunities of collecting information.
==Works==
Ralph of Diceto&#x27;s Chronicle covers the history of the world from the birth of Jesus to the year 1202. It is divided into two parts, often treated as separate works: the (&quot;Abbreviations of Chronicles&quot;) up to around 1147 and the or (&quot;Images of Histories&quot;) from then until 1202.

The former is a work of learning and industry but is almost entirely based upon extant sources. The latter, beginning as a compilation from Robert de Monte and the letters of Bishop Foliot, becomes an original authority and a contemporary record . In precision and fullness of detail, however, the are inferior to the chronicles of Roger of Howden. Ralph is careless in his chronology. The documents which he incorporates, while often important, are selected on no overarching principle. He has little sense of style but displays considerable insight when he ventures to discuss a political situation. For this reason and on account of the details with which they supplement the more important chronicles of the period, the are a valuable (though secondary) source.

==Editions==
* . The first volume (Google Books) contains an introduction, the , the (&quot;Summary of the Images of History&quot;), and the first part of the itself. The second volume (Internet Archive) contains the from 1180–1202 and minor works, compendia of facts taken from well-known sources.
* . This covers Diceto&#x27;s fragmentary domesday of the deanery&#x27;s estates.

<text>Steam beer, also known as California common beer, is made by fermenting lager yeast at a higher than normal temperature. 

Historically steam beer came from Bavaria, Germany, and is associated with San Francisco and the West Coast of the United States. It was an improvised process, originating out of necessity, and was considered a cheap, low-quality beer, as shown by references to it in literature of the 1890s and 1900s.

Modern steam beer originated with the Anchor Brewing Company, which trademarked the term in 1981 (and ceased operations in 2023). Although the modern company had corporate continuity with a small brewery which made beer since the 1890s, Anchor Steam was a modern craft-brewed lager. The company did not claim any close similarity between its present-day product and turn-of-the-20th-century steam beer.

==Etymology==
There have been various explanations for the use of the name &quot;steam beer&quot;. According to Anchor Brewing, the name &quot;steam&quot; came from the fact that the brewery had no way to effectively chill the boiling wort using traditional means. So they pumped the hot wort up to large, shallow, open-top bins on the roof of the brewery so that it would be rapidly chilled by the cool air blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. Thus while brewing, the brewery had a distinct cloud of steam around the roof let off by the wort as it cooled, hence the name. Another explanation is that the carbon dioxide pressure produced by the 19th-century steam-beer-making process was very high, and that it may have been necessary as part of the process to let off &quot;steam&quot; before attempting to dispense the beer. It is also possible that the name or brewing process derive from &quot;Dampfbier&quot; (literally &quot;steam beer&quot;), a traditional German beer that was also fermented at unusually high temperatures and that may have been known to 19th-century American brewers, many of whom were of German descent; Dampfbier is an ale, however, not a lager.

==Brewing process==

In 19th-century California, brewers found a strain of lager yeast which would ferment at higher temperatures.

The flavor of beer is influenced by the strain of yeast and the fermentation temperature. Lager yeast is best used at temperatures from . Classic lagering of beers takes place over a period of time from weeks to many months at a temperature of . Conversely, ale yeast is best used at temperatures from . Fermentation by ale yeasts produces a beer that has a more distinct flavor. Steam Beer uses bottom fermenting lager yeasts at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinctive flavor profile that includes both ale and lager characteristics.

While steam beer is considered a specialty microbrew style of beer today, it was originally a cheap beer made for blue collar workers. Wahl and Heinus&#x27;s &quot;American Handy Book of Brewing and Malting&quot; (1902) describes California Steam Beer as “a very clear, refreshing drink, much consumed by the laboring classes&quot;, and while most modern California common beers are all-barley malt, adjuncts were often used in the early days. Malt, grits, or raw cereals of any kind, and sugars, especially glucose, were added in the kettle and roasted malt or sugar coloring used to give the amber color of Munich beer.

==In literature==
Jack London refers to steam beer in his &quot;alcoholic memoir&quot;, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, in a passage explaining how he started drinking in late-1880s San Francisco:

:The first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper, according to custom, called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up pins for several hours. The others asked for beer. I said I&#x27;d take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer.

As a budding writer, &quot;a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest of honour to a beer bust&quot; and was challenged to a drinking contest.

:I&#x27;d show them, the young rascals... These unlicked cubs who thought they could out-drink &quot;me!&quot; Faugh! It was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer...

Frank Norris&#x27;s 1899 novel &quot;McTeague&quot;, set in San Francisco, sets the stage with a reference to steam beer in its opening paragraph:

:It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that day, McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car conductors&#x27; coffee-joint on Polk Street. He had a thick gray soup; heavy, underdone meat, very hot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet pudding, full of strong butter and sugar. On his way back to his office, one block above, he stopped at Joe Frenna&#x27;s saloon and bought a pitcher of steam beer. It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to dinner... By and by, gorged with steam beer, and overcome by the heat of the room, the cheap tobacco, and the effects of his heavy meal, he dropped off to sleep.

When he marries, his wife convinces him to adopt more refined habits:

:She broke him of the habit of eating with his knife, she caused him to substitute bottled beer in the place of steam beer, and she induced him to take off his hat to Miss Baker, to Heise&#x27;s wife, and to the other women of his acquaintance.

==California Common beer==
Apart from Anchor Steam, other commercial examples include Skyscraper Brewing Company Lug Nut Lager, Moab Brewery Rocket Bike Lager, Southampton West Coast Steam Beer, Old Dominion Victory Amber, Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager, Schlafly&#x27;s Pi Common, Linden Street Common Lager, Eagle Steam Beer, 33 Acres Brewing Company California Common, Cosmic Brewing Company Plead the Fifth, and Mare Island Brewing Company War Bond.

==Other varieties of &quot;steam beer&quot;==
Adam Wood Steam Brewery is listed as having been sold in 1859.

A British brewery, the Lincolnshire Steam Beer Co., derives its name from the steam-powered brewing machinery.

When Canadian brewer Sleeman introduced a product called Steam Beer in Canada in 1999, Anchor sued for trademark infringement, since it had trademarked the term &quot;steam beer&quot; in Canada ten years earlier. Canadian courts dismissed the suit and subsequent appeals, ruling that Anchor&#x27;s Canadian trademark was invalid, since the beer had not been marketed in Canada up to that time. After Sapporo bought Sleeman in a $400-million takeover in 2006, Sleeman&#x27;s production of Steam Beer was discontinued.

In Richmond, Virginia, the remains of a former Yuengling brewery along the James River were once called David Yuengling Jr.&#x27;s James River Steam Brewery, located at (or near) 912 East Main St.

&quot;The St. Louis Guide for Citizens and Strangers&quot; (1859) shows advertising copy for J. F. Boyd &amp; Co. St. Louis Ale, Porter and Lager Beer Steam Brewery.

The 1865, New Orleans City Directory has an advertisement for the Old Canal Steam Brewery, &quot;First Lager-Beer Steam Brewery in New Orleans&quot;, owned by Geo. Merz, next to the Ice House and Lager Beer Cellar.

Widmer Brothers Brewery released Columbia Common Beer, a seasonal common ale which is brewed with lager and hefeweizen yeasts and Columbia hops.

Derecho Common was issued by the Port City Brewing Company of Alexandria, VA after the power outages related to the June 2012 North American derecho resulted in a tank of Port City&#x27;s beer fermenting as a steam beer due to loss of refrigeration. Port City has since continued to release Derecho Common.

Steam beer may have developed in parallel in North Korea. Due to the scarcity of electricity, a North Korean beer style very similar to steam beer has developed because it does not require refrigeration.

Many brewing supply shops provide a Steam Beer/California Common kit, and recipes abound.

<text>Rauf Yekta Bey (27 March 1871 – 8 January 1935) was a Turkish musician, musicologist and writer on music. 

==Biography==
Rauf Yekta was born on 27 March 1871, in the Aksaray area of Istanbul, Turkey to his father Ahmed Arif Bey. He was named Mehmed Rauf but adopted Rauf Yekta as a pen name.
Rauf Yekta spoke 3 languages: French, Arabic and Persian. He was a government official.
Zeliha Han married Rauf Yekta Bey and they had two sons and two daughters.

==Contribution to the theory of Turkish classical music==

Yekta wrote the first modern account of Turkish classical music available in a Western language (Raouf Yekta Bey, &quot;La musique turque&quot;, in &quot;Encyclopedie de la musique et dictionnaire du Conservatoire&quot;, edited by Albert Lavignac, Première partie, Volume V, pp. 2945–3064. Paris, 1922). His emphasis in this encyclopedia article was on intervals, modes and rhythms, quoting some 73 musical examples. 

In the article he introduced a modified European notation. Yekta&#x27;s system used a variety of accidentals to express the microtonal inflections necessary for the Turkish modal system. This notational system was the one used for the official publications of the Istanbul Conservatory during the 1920s and 1930s.

The present-day theory of Turkish classical music is the result of collaboration by Yekta with Dr. Suphi Ezgi (1869–1962) and H. Sadettin Arel (1880–1955).

==Career as a performer==

Yekta performed often at Mevlevi ceremonies.

<doc id="1120377" wikidata="Q1306072" url="?curid=1120377" title="Monopod">
<text>A monopod, also called a unipod, is a single staff or pole used to help support cameras, binoculars, rifles or other precision instruments in the field.

==Camera and imaging use==
The monopod allows a still camera to be held steadier, allowing the photographer to take sharp pictures at slower shutter speeds, and/or with longer focal length lenses. In the case of video, it reduces camera shake, and therefore most of the resulting small random movements. Monopods are easier to transport and quicker to set up than conventional tripods, making them preferable for on-the-go (OTG) photography. An OTG photographer is not able to carry a heavy, bulky tripod around, and when they see a potential shot, there is no time to bother with setting up a complicated tripod. A simple monopod is easy to carry, easy to set up, and enables the photographer to take advantage of the situation they are presented with, all while providing camera support to capture a clear, sharp image. Examples of situations in which a monopod is preferable include wildlife and sports photography where you can dramatically increase the stability of long lenses, travel photography, particularly around the golden hours and of course outdoor macro photography, especially when trying to photograph insects etc.

When used by itself, it eliminates camera shake in the vertical axis. When used in combination with leaning against a large object, a bipod is formed; this can also eliminate horizontal motion.

Unlike a tripod, monopods cannot support a camera independently. In the case of still cameras, this limits the shutter speed that can be used. They still allow longer exposures than hand holding, and are easier to carry and use than a tripod. Because it confers less stability than a tripod, monopods may present difficulties when trying to get a good image with very low light photography, i.e. night time, and shots where you need a 100% stable camera for example shooting light trails or landscapes with extreme depth of field.

Many monopods can also be used as a &quot;beltpod,&quot; meaning that the foot of the monopod can rest on the belt or hip of the photographer. This is usually used in selfies for clearer shots by ensuring that the camera is not in motion relative to the body.

With a special adapter, monopods can be used as a &quot;chestpod&quot;, meaning that the foot rests now on the chest of the photographer. The result is that the camera is held more steadily than by hand alone (though not as steadily as when the foot is planted on the ground), and the camera/monopod is completely mobile, travelling with the photographer&#x27;s movements. This technique is widely used in videography in which the photographer has to move with the subject e.g. first-person scenes, and is also especially useful for disabled photographers.

Generally, in terms of mobility versus stability, if mobility increases, stability decreases as follows:
* Tripod or tablepod resting on a solid surface (most stable)
* Monopod on solid surface
* &quot;Chestpod&quot; / &quot;Beltpod&quot;
* Hand-held (least stable)

Monopods are often equipped with a ball swivel, allowing some freedom to pan and tilt the camera while the monopod remains relatively stationary.

Walking sticks or &quot;trekking poles&quot; exist that have a 1/4&quot;-20 threaded stud on the top of the handle, usually covered by a cap when not in use, allowing them to double as a camera monopod. The user would usually need to carry a ball swivel adapter separately and mount it as needed.

Monopods used with a smartphone or camera to take selfie photographs beyond the normal reach of the arm are known as selfie sticks, and (depending on the model) may have Bluetooth connectivity.

== Ways of attaching a camera ==
There are two ways to attach your camera to a monopod. The first is to screw the monopod&#x27;s screw thread directly into the camera body. This is fine if you&#x27;re using a fairly small, light lens.

If you&#x27;re shooting using a long, heavy telephoto lens, it&#x27;s better to use a tripod mount ring. This fixes the monopod to the lens rather than the camera body, giving better balance and stopping the monopod from rotating in your hands as you try to position it.

There are various different types of monopod head available, and ball heads offer the most flexibility. They allow you to shoot in portrait or landscape orientation, and angle your camera to adjust for any sloping of the monopod.

==Firearms==

A monopod can be used for firearms. They have the advantage of being light and compact, although when used in firing mode they can only be used with small firearms. They are also used as &quot;butt spikes&quot; as a rear support on precision rifles.

==Precision optical and measuring instruments==
When used to support a compass or transit, the monopod is referred to as a &quot;jacob staff&quot;. Mounting the compass atop the jacob staff eliminates reading errors introduced by body movements, and permits the taking of more precise bearings to targets.

Monopods known as &quot;finnsticks&quot; are also used to steady high-power (typically, 10× or more) binoculars to permit a clear view without shake or wobble introduced by the user&#x27;s hand and body movements. With the introduction of gyroscopically stabilized binoculars, the use of stabilizing supports for binoculars have declined in recent years.
