<text>The desert lark (Ammomanes deserti) breeds in deserts and semi-deserts from Morocco to western India. It has a very wide distribution and faces no obvious threats, and surveys have shown that it is slowly increasing in numbers as it expands its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Originally, the desert lark was classified as belonging to the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; until moved to &quot;Ammomanes&quot;. Alternate names include desert finch lark and sand lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Twenty-two subspecies are recognized: 
* Southern Moroccan desert lark (&quot;A. d. payni&quot;) - : Found in southern Morocco and south-western Algeria
* Algerian desert lark or North Algerian desert lark (&quot;A. d. algeriensis&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern Algeria, Tunisia, north-western Libya and north-western Chad
* South Algerian desert lark (&quot;A. d. whitakeri&quot;) - : Found in south-eastern Algeria and south-western Libya

==Description==
The desert lark is a medium-sized, big-headed and long-billed lark, growing to a length of . The sexes are alike, but there is considerable geographical variation. It has a rather dull plumage which can vary from quite pale to rather dark. Plumage may vary between subspecies but individuals within populations can be variable too. It is similar in appearance to the bar-tailed lark but is slightly larger, has a less-domed head, a larger broader beak, stouter legs and a longer tail. The upper parts of the many subspecies vary in colour; most are pale greyish brown, but some races are very washed out and others are quite a deep colour. Some have some rufous colour on wings and tail, similar to the bar-tailed lark, but the underparts are a pale pinkish grey and have much more streaking than that species, and the desert lark lacks the clearly defined terminal black band on the tail of that species, although it may have a rather diffuse dark patch. The colour variation seems to mainly match the habitat, so sandy-coloured birds are commoner in sandy areas, greyer birds in rocky areas and the darkest birds in desert dominated by basalt.

The song is a mournful &quot;choo-wee-chacha &quot;, uttered from the ground or a boulder, or during undulating flight. It is more mellow and less squeaky than that of the bar-tailed lark. When flushed it utters a short &quot;&quot; or &quot;chee-lu&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The desert lark is found from Mauritania, Western Sahara and southern Morocco in the west east through northern Africa south to Chad and Somalia through south west Asia to western India.

It is resident (non-migratory) apart from local movements in arid stony areas, and avoids flat sand and will always be found in broken terrain with a vertical element to it

==Behaviour and ecology==
The desert lark is not very sociable and does not form large flocks, being mainly encountered in small groups or as single birds. They are territorial when breeding, nesting on the ground under the shelter of a tussock or stone in a shallow scrape lined with plant material and having a rim of pebbles, which may surround the nest or be on the more exposed side of the nest. The clutch is 1-5 eggs and these are laid at different times in various parts of its range, e.g. January–February in the south and March–April in the north. The desert lark eats seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

<text>Poulan is a brand name of the Swedish manufacturer Husqvarna AB.

==History==
Poulan was founded as Poulan Saw Co. in 1946 by chainsaw pioneer Claude Poulan in Shreveport, Louisiana. Purchased in late 1950s or early &#x27;60 by the Beaird Company, also of Shreveport, it was known as Beaird-Poulan. The company was acquired by Emerson Electric in 1972, and was purchased by Electrolux in 1984, which closed its Shreveport factory in 1988. In 2006 Electrolux spun off Husqvarna into its own company. In 2022, a company called Valsi in Mexico purchased tooling from Husqvarna for manufacturing walk behind mowers. Valsi also purchased the rights to manufacture outdoor power equipment under the Poulan Pro brand.

==Poulan brand today==
The Poulan brand name is used primarily for outdoor power equipment, such as chainsaws, lawn mowers, and leaf blowers, aimed at the mid-level consumer market. Since Poulan is owned by Husqvarna, the two brands often share technologies. In recent years Poulan has offered a more upscale &quot;Poulan Pro&quot; brand employing a black and gold color scheme instead of Poulan&#x27;s traditional green. As a result, Poulan products have been pushed even further upmarket.

<doc id="1140759" wikidata="Q2292719" url="?curid=1140759" title="Chris Klein (soccer)">
<text>Chris Klein (born January 4, 1976) is an American former soccer player who spent 13 seasons in Major League Soccer and earned 22 caps with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. He became the club president of the LA Galaxy on January 28, 2013, after a promotion from vice president. Klein was fired from the LA Galaxy on May 30, 2023, after 11 seasons with the club.

A former midfielder, Klein spent the entirety of his 12-year professional career playing in Major League Soccer, for the Kansas City Wizards, Real Salt Lake and Los Angeles Galaxy, winning the MLS Cup and Supporters&#x27; Shield with Kansas City in 2000, and the Supporters&#x27; Shield with Los Angeles in 2010, his last year as a professional. He was notable for his fitness and resilience to injury, setting an MLS record in 2008 when he made his 118th consecutive first team start. Klein was also a veteran member of the United States national team during the early 2000s; he acquired 23 caps, scored 5 goals, and represented his country at the 2003 Confederations Cup.

==Career==

===Amateur===
Klein attended De Smet Jesuit High School, winning a Missouri state championship in the fall of 1993. He played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1994 to 1997. In total, he started 88 games for the Hoosiers, registering 11 goals and 11 assists as a senior.

===Professional===
Upon his graduation, Klein was selected fourth overall by the Kansas City Wizards in the 1998 MLS College Draft. He received little playing time as a rookie, starting eight games and substituting into nine, and scored no points. Starting in 1999, however, Klein began to cement a place for himself as one of the league&#x27;s best midfielders; in the 1999 season, Klein started 24 games for the Wizards, registering six goals and five assists. He started 26 games in 2000, scoring six goals and eight assists, helping the Wizards to an MLS Cup victory. Klein has been an equally important part of the Wizards midfield for the last four years, although his 2004 campaign was cut short by a torn ACL. He came back in 2005 and was named MLS Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career, his first coming in 2002. However, before the 2006 season, Klein was traded with an international roster spot to Real Salt Lake for allocation money.

On June 21, 2007, Klein was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy for midfielder Nathan Sturgis and forward Robbie Findley.

===International===
Klein was a fringe player for the United States national team for several years. He received his first cap October 25, 2000 against Mexico, his debut for the men&#x27;s national team at any age level. He has played in a total of 22 games for the national team, scoring five goals; his best year was 2003, when he played in seven games, and scored three goals.

==After playing career==

Klein was the club president of the LA Galaxy for 11 seasons, during which the team missed the playoffs four times. A fan protest in 2023 led to his firing. He was also sanctioned by MLS for a violation of roster rules during the 2019 season. He also served as an assistant coach for Newport Mesa Soccer Club, which is part of the West Ham International Academy.

==Personal life==
Klein is married with three children. He and his wife are evangelical Christians, and Klein is active with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Klein resides in suburban Los Angeles with his family.

<doc id="1140773" wikidata="Q1631822" url="?curid=1140773" title="Sleepwalkers (1992 film)">
<text>Sleepwalkers (also known as Stephen King&#x27;s Sleepwalkers) is a 1992 American horror film written by Stephen King and directed by Mick Garris. The film stars Brian Krause, Mädchen Amick and Alice Krige. The film revolves around the last two survivors of a vampiric shapeshifting species that feed on the life force of human female virgins. It was the first time King wrote a screenplay intended for the screen first, rather than adapting one of his novels or stories.

==Plot==

Charles Brady and his mother/lover Mary are sleepwalkers, nomadic shapeshifting energy vampires who feed off the lifeforce of virgin women. Though they normally maintain a human form, they can transform into human-sized bipedal werecats, their natural form, at will. They have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Domestic cats are their only weakness, and the two species are mutually hostile. Cats see through their illusions and violently attack them, inflicting severe to fatal wounds on them with their claws and teeth.

Charles and Mary live in Travis, a small Indiana town, having recently fled Bodega Bay, California, after draining and killing a young girl there. Charles attends the local high school, and meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class. Charles feigns romantic interest in Tanya in order to take her lifeforce for himself and his starving mother. Their teacher, Mr. Fallows, is suspicious about Charles and tells him that his older high school certificates were fakes; he also physically assaults Charles, but Charles kills him.

On their first date, at a picnic at a nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain Tanya&#x27;s lifeforce while kissing her. Tanya tries frantically to ward off Charles by bashing his head with her camera, scratching his face, and plunging a corkscrew into his left eye, though nothing she does seems to cause Charles more than temporary discomfort.

Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson is driving by the cemetery. When Tanya flees to him for help, Charles kills Simpson. When Charles resumes feeding off Tanya, the deputy&#x27;s cat, Clovis, enraged by his master’s death, violently scratches him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded, Charles staggers back home to his mother, who is able to make both of them &quot;dim&quot; (almost invisible) and thus keep Charles from being arrested when the police storm their house. Clovis and a small number of other cats begin to gather outside, only kept at bay by the leghold traps the Sleepwalkers have set.

Knowing that the only way for her dying son to survive is to feed, Mary attacks the Robertson household, killing several deputies and state troopers and severely wounding Tanya&#x27;s parents. She kidnaps Tanya and takes her back to her house. Charles is near death, but Mary revives him, and Charles makes a final attempt to drain Tanya&#x27;s life force. However, Tanya plunges her fingers into his eyes, killing him. Tanya escapes with the help of the sheriff, whom Mary later impales on the picket fence surrounding the house. The cats that have been gathering around their house, led by Clovis, jump on Mary and claw and bite her until she bursts into flames and dies. Tanya hugs Clovis, her savior, as the other cats depart, leaving Mary&#x27;s body lying ablaze on her former driveway.

==Cast==
== Production ==
&quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; was the first film written by King to not be based on one of his preexisting works. Columbia Pictures initially approached Rupert Wainwright to direct, but at King&#x27;s insistence Columbia offered the film to Mick Garris, who had previously directed the horror films &quot;Critters 2: The Main Course&quot; and &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;. The film was shot in Franklin Canyon Park in Los Angeles, California.

Garris said there were a couple of ideas he put into the film that hadn&#x27;t been in King&#x27;s original script. One is the introduction and title sequence from that page in the &quot;Book of Arcane Knowledge&quot; (which he invented) to give it a little backstory. The other was the scene where the Sleepwalkers are making love. Garris said this sex scene was so explicit he had to cut it to avoid an X-rating by the Motion Picture Association.

==Soundtrack==
The original music score was composed by Nicholas Pike.

(Side 2 of the cassette begins at track 9)

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 29% based on 17 reviews, giving it an average rating of 4.4/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 38% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an idiotic horror potboiler&quot;.
British horror critic Alan Jones gave the film a scathing review in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, saying that &quot;Garris tries to inject life into the pathetic script... but this underdeveloped material is so poor he&#x27;s constantly fighting a losing battle. There&#x27;s little to engage the attention in an idiotic potboiler off the creaky King conveyor belt. From the daft prologue set in Bodega Bay where Hitchcock filmed &quot;The Birds&quot; to the soggy moggy climax, this is absurdly unscary and confusingly dull.&quot; In &quot;Horror Films FAQ: All That&#x27;s Left to Know About Slashers, Vampires, Zombies, Aliens, and More&quot;, John Kenneth Muir praised the first half of the film, stating: &quot;&quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; starts out in fine form, as a serious, grim, involving horror film about the last two survivors of a species doing what they must to survive, Krige is incredibly sensual as the half-crazed mother who must be &#x27;fed&#x27; through the act of sexual intercourse with her son.&quot; He then says that the latter half of the film &quot;devolves into a campy disaster.&quot;

==Proposed sequel==
In April 2020, on his Post Mortem podcast during a listener Q&amp;A session with Joe Russo, Garris confirmed that there was discussion from Columbia Pictures about a sequel, saying in full, &quot;There was a little bit of talk. I mean, the movie was successful, it was the #1 movie the week that it came out. I never heard the studio talk about it, but Tabitha King, Stephen King&#x27;s wife, actually wrote a treatment for a sequel to &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; that involved a women&#x27;s basketball team somehow. I&#x27;m not sure how, I never read it, but King was very excited that Tabby came up with this. But it was a sequel that nobody at the studio gave a shit about. You know, they liked the money that &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; made, but it was not a prestige release by any means, so they never even thought about &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; after.&quot; Both Garris and Russo then discussed a potential reboot, with Garris expressing surprise that there was seemingly no interest, with Russo admitting that &quot;We had a very flirtatious conversation with a production company about a year ago, maybe. It was nothing more than flirting.&quot;

<doc id="1140774" wikidata="Q161564" url="?curid=1140774" title="1,8-Bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene">
<text>1,8-Bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene is an organic compound with the formula CH(NMe) (Me = methyl). It is classified as a peri-naphthalene, i.e. a 1,8-disubstituted derivative of naphthalene. Owing to its unusual structure, it exhibits exceptional basicity. It is often referred by the trade name Proton Sponge, a trademark of Sigma-Aldrich.

==Structure and properties==
This compound is a diamine in which the two dimethylamino groups are attached on the same side (peri position) of a naphthalene ring. This molecule has several very interesting properties; one is its very high basicity; another is its spectroscopic properties.

With a p&quot;K&quot; of 12.34 for its conjugate acid in aqueous solution, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene is one of the strongest organic bases. However, it only absorbs protons slowly—hence the trade name. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and/or the strong interaction between the nitrogen lone pairs. Additionally, although many aromatic amines such as aniline show reduced basicity (due to nitrogen being sp2 hybridized; its lone pair occupying a 2p orbital and interacting and being withdrawn by the aromatic ring), this is not possible in this molecule, as the nitrogens&#x27; methyl groups prevent its substituents from adopting a planar geometry, as this would require forcing methyl groups from each nitrogen atom into one another—thus the basicity is not reduced by this factor which is found in other molecules. It is sterically hindered, making it a weak nucleophile. Because of this combination of properties, it has been used in organic synthesis as a highly selective non-nucleophilic base.

Proton sponge also exhibits a very high affinity for boron and is capable of displacing hydride from borane to form a boronium–borohydride ion pair.

==Preparation==
This compound is commercially available. It may be prepared by the methylation of 1,8-diaminonaphthalene with iodomethane or dimethyl sulfate.

==Related compounds==
===Other proton sponges===
Second generation proton sponges are known with even higher basicity. 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN is prepared from 1,8-diaminonaphthalene by reaction with tris(dimethylamino)bromophosphonium bromide in the presence of triethylamine. HMPN has a pK of 29.9 in acetonitrile which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge.

The aromatization of an additional ring in 4,12-Dihydrogen-4,8,12-triazatriangulene is utilized by Al-Yassiri and Puchta to get a representative for a new class of Δ-shaped proton sponges. This compound has a calculated proton affinity of 254 kcal/mol (B3LYP/6-311+G**) and is therefore between 1,8-Bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene and HMPN.

===Hydride sponge===
The chemical inverse of a proton sponge would be a hydride sponge. This property is exhibited by CH(BMe), which reacts with potassium hydride to afford K[CH(BMe)H].

<doc id="1140775" wikidata="Q97210751" url="?curid=1140775" title="Artillery observer">
<text>An artillery observer, artillery spotter, or forward observer (FO) is a soldier responsible for directing artillery and mortar fire support onto a target. An artillery observer usually accompanies a tank or infantry unit. Spotters ensure that indirect fire hits targets which those at a fire support base cannot see.

== History ==

Historically, the range of artillery steadily increased over the centuries. In the era of bombards or &quot;Steinbüchse&quot;, the gunner could usually still fire directly on the target by line-of-sight. As ranges increased, methods of employing indirect fire were developed. This made a forward observer essential in order to be able to use artillery effectively. The proximity of the observer to the target depended on the terrain and battlefield situation. Elevated observation posts could be used as an aid to facilitate communication between the guns and the observers. The development of optical and communication aids for observation advanced significantly in the First and Second World Wars. In the 21st century, Joint Tactical Fire Support observers emerged usually using sophisticated communications engineering systems.

== Description ==
Because artillery is an indirect fire weapon system, the guns are rarely in line-of-sight of their target, often located miles away. The observer serves as the eyes of the guns, by sending target locations and if necessary corrections to the fall of shot, usually by radio. Equipment used in the observer role ranges from binoculars to laser rangefinders to unmanned aerial vehicles. When attached to a special forces unit, an artillery observer is often tasked with coordinating fire from long-range artillery guns against high-value targets such as enemy headquarters. This is in contrast to an artillery observer&#x27;s typical work with field/line artillery, which works in support of its own combat group. Such patrols may also form into &#x27;stay behind&#x27; parties which deliberately hide in special observation hides as the main force fights a withdrawal.

Broadly, there are two very different approaches to artillery observation. Either the observer has command authority and orders fire, including the type and amount of ammunition to be fired, to batteries. Or the observer requests fire from an artillery headquarters at some level, which decides if fire will be provided, by which batteries, and the type and amount of ammunition to be provided. The first is characterized by the British, the second by the United States. In World War II both Germany and the Soviet Union tended towards the British method. In the British system, the observer sends a fire order to their own and any other batteries authorized to them, and may request fire from additional batteries. Each battery command post converts the fire orders into firing data for its own guns. Until post-World War II the observer would usually order actual firing data to the guns of their own troop, this was enabled by the use of calibrating sights on the guns.

In the U.S. system, the observer sends a request for fire, usually to their battalion or battery Fire Direction Center (FDC). The FDC then decides how much fire to permit and may request additional fire from a higher artillery headquarters. FDC(s) convert the observer&#x27;s target information into firing data for the battery&#x27;s weapons. The equivalent of an artillery observer for close air support is a forward air controller, while for the equivalent for naval gunfire support is a spotter. For general fire support, the position is known as a fire support specialist (FiSTer) or simply an observer.

== U.S. Army / U.S. Marine Corps ==

In the U.S. Army, a Light, Heavy, or Stryker Infantry company Fire Support Team (FIST) consists of a Fire Support Officer (FSO), a Fire Support Sergeant, three Forward Observers (FO), two Fire Support Specialists and three Radio Telephone Operators (RTO). Armored/Cavalry FIST teams usually consist of just one FSO and three enlisted personnel. Brigade COLT teams operate in groups of two individuals, a Fire support specialist in the grade of E-1 to E-4 and a Fire Support Sergeant in the grade of E-5. Currently in unit training is beginning to incorporate more close air support and close combat attack missions into the field artillery team&#x27;s mission.

In the U.S. Marine Corps, scout observers also act as naval gunfire spotters and call for, observe and adjust artillery and naval gunfire support, and coordinate fire support assets to include mortars, rockets, artillery, NSFS and CAS/CIFS. A rifle company Fire Support Team typically consists of a Fire Support Officer (FSO), Forward Air Controller (FAC) or Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), two scout observers (FO), and two radio operators (RO). In Weapons Company, the Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC) determines fire support asset allocation to each rifle company FiST, and supervises the planning and execution of each FiST&#x27;s fire support plan. Key players in the FSCC include the Fire Support Coordinator (FSC), Battalion Fire Support Officer (FSO), and Battalion Air Officer (Air-O).

== British Forward Observation Officer ==

For centuries the Battery Commander had been responsible for controlling the fire of their battery. This continued with the introduction of indirect fire in the early years of the 20th Century. However, the First World War introduced 24 hour, seven days a week fighting. Furthermore, indirect fire had increased the distance between the guns and their targets, and between the observers and their guns. This led to the use of observing officers to act on behalf of the battery commander. In the 1938 re-organization of the Royal Artillery batteries were divided into troops, with the troop commanders (Captains) as observing officers at an (OP). These officers and their parties could operate as either as an Observation Post (OP) or accompany the supported arm (infantry or armour) as Forward Observation Officers (FOOs). During World War II it became the practice for close support battery commanders to become part of the tank regiment or infantry battalion headquarters they were supporting. They also started using &#x27;quick fireplans&#x27; usually limited to their own regiment, to support fast moving limited battalion actions.

Generally FOOs were assigned to a company or squadron of a battalion or regiment that their battery was supporting. In the British artillery system FOOs were always authorized to order fire commands to their own troop or battery, based on their assessment of the tactical situation and if necessary liaison with the supported arm commander.

From mid World War II some artillery observers were authorized to order fire to all batteries of their regiment, it also became the practice for some observers to be designated &#x27;Commander&#x27;s Representative&#x27; able to order fire to a divisional or corps artillery. Unauthorized officers could request fire from more than their own battery. During that war it also became the practice that FOOs arranged quick fireplans comprising several coordinated targets engaged by guns and mortars to support short offensive actions by the squadron or company they were with.

In World War II OP/FOO parties were normally mounted in an armored carrier, although those assigned to support armored brigades usually had a tank – initially a Stuart but in NW Europe usually a Sherman. Tanks continued to be used by some observers until about 1975. In 2002 the British Army adopted the term Fire Support Team (FST) for its observation parties, including FACs under control of the artillery officer commanding the FST.

A functionally similar title is a mortar fire controller (MFC). An MFC is an infantry NCO who is part of their battalion&#x27;s mortar platoon. He controls platoon&#x27;s fire in the same way as an FOO. The introduction of FSTs places MFCs under tactical control of the FST commander.

Training, enabled by simulators, allows most soldiers to observe artillery fire, which has long been possible via a FOO.

==Air observation post==

The Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force had been responsible reporting targets and observation of fire in World War I, this role was subsequently called &#x27;Arty/R, but proved difficult from high performance aircraft over hostile territory in World War II. In 1940 it was agreed that RAF AOP squadrons equipped with light aircraft, operating at low altitude over friendly territory and flown by Royal Artillery officers would be formed. These squadrons existed until the formation of the Army Air Corps in 1957.

==Use of unmanned aerial vehicles==
Since the development of small unmanned aerial vehicles, they have been used for identifying targets, spotting fall of shot, and correcting aim. Operators are usually relatively close to the target, behind enemy lines, and subject to attack.

<doc id="1140777" wikidata="Q1264630" url="?curid=1140777" title="Dukes Highway">
<text>Dukes Highway is a 190 kilometre highway corridor in South Australia, which is part of the link between the Australian cities of Adelaide and Melbourne. It is part of the National Highway system spanning Australia, and is signed as route A8.

==Route==
Dukes Highway begins at the intersection with Princes Highway in Tailem Bend. It heads in a southeast direction to the state border with Victoria just east of Bordertown, continuing into Victoria as Western Highway, with the same route signage (route A8). It is mostly a single carriageway of one lane each way, with 36 overtaking lanes. Approximately has &#x27;wide centre lines&#x27;, providing a boundary between traffic travelling in opposite directions.

Generally, the quality of Dukes Highway is of a high standard, with the entire road having wide lane widths and sealed shoulders with at least five (and usually six) metres clear beyond the edge line. There are 16 rest areas or parking bays along the Dukes Highway, at approximately 15 km intervals. Each one provides sealed parking space for at least four B-double trucks, with bins, tables, shelter and lighting.

==History==
Dukes Highway runs through the northern part of the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. The route and many of the settlements, including Bordertown, were established in the 1850s to supply water to horses for the gold escorts from the Victorian goldfields to Adelaide.

Gold was taken to Adelaide rather than the closer Melbourne because a higher price was offered there. The higher price was offered to stop the South Australian economy from collapsing, as all the labourers were heading to the Victorian Goldfields. The &quot;Bullion Act&quot; was passed and an Assay office was established in Adelaide for the assaying and stamping of gold in 1852. It is claimed that this saved South Australia from bankruptcy.

By the 1930s, the series of separate tracks had started to coalesce into the route it follows today, and was already being referred to as &quot;the Duke&#x27;s Highway&quot; – after the Duke of York, later King George VI – but at the time the name had never been officially recognised. There was a push to name the road Tolmer Highway, after former police commissioner Alexander Tolmer of gold escort fame, but this never eventuated.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the western end of Dukes Highway was realigned to meet the Mallee Highway closer to Tailem Bend. It previously ran north from Coomandook on the alignment that is now known as the &quot;Old Dukes Highway&quot; to Moorlands.

The final 17 km of the highway after Bordertown, was originally built on unstable ground, and was re-constructed in 2005.

== Safety ==
Dukes Highway is South Australia&#x27;s deadliest major road, with 28 deaths in the 5 years to 2009. This has led to calls for road improvements to separate traffic in each direction with a dual carriageway. Point-to-point speed cameras have been installed on one section of the highway to identify drivers who flout the speed limit.

Parts of the highway have wider centre lines installed, with audio tactile treatment to help drivers to realise and recover from drifting across the centre line before they encounter an oncoming vehicle. This is intended to reduce fatigue and inattention-related crashes.

<doc id="1140781" wikidata="Q209935" url="?curid=1140781" title="Point-and-shoot camera">
<text>A point-and-shoot camera, also known as a compact camera and sometimes abbreviated to P&amp;S, is a still camera (either film or digital) designed primarily for simple operation. Most use focus free lenses or autofocus for focusing, automatic systems for setting the exposure options, and have flash units built in. They are popular for vernacular photography by people who do not consider themselves photographers but want easy-to-use cameras for snapshots of vacations, parties, reunions and other events.

Most compact digital cameras use small 1/2.3-type (“1/2.3-inch”) image sensors, but since 2008, a few non-interchangeable lens compact cameras use a larger sensor such as 1.0-type (“1-inch”), APS-C (e.g. Fujifilm X100 series), or even full frame (e.g. Sony RX1 series). Most models prioritize being operated in auto mode, but some high end point-and-shoot cameras have PASM (program, aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual modes) on the mode dial, raw image format, and a hot shoe. None have interchangeable lenses, but some have secondary lens mounts. 

Point-and-shoots have been by far the best selling type of standalone camera, as distinct from camera phones. However, point-and-shoot camera sales declined after about 2010 as smartphones overtook them in usage. To overcome market shrinkage, compact camera manufacturers began making higher-end versions with a stylish metal body.

== Types of point-and-shoot digital cameras ==
Current point-and-shoot digital cameras have coalesced into three categories:
* premium compact cameras with a large sensor and prime lens optimized for travel and street photography;
* vlogging cameras with a flip screen and wide-angle or ultra wide-angle lens;
* travel zoom cameras with a compact body.
Fixed-lens cameras that include an all-in-one superzoom lens in a large DSLR-style body are known as bridge cameras.

==Types of point-and-shoot film cameras==
The lowest-end point-and-shoot film cameras are similar to disposable cameras, but can be reloaded. These cameras have focus-free lenses, with fixed apertures. They may or may not have a light meter. Most have a wheel or lever for advancing the film and cocking the shutter, and a crank for returning the film to the canister for unloading. Because of the fixed apertures, models with flash have no way of controlling the exposure from the flash. Therefore, flash pictures have to be taken within a narrow range of distance from the subject.

Advanced models use automatic focus and have variable apertures. They all have light meters. They use electric motors to advance and rewind the film. They are much more versatile than the low-end models. They are also likely to have zoom lenses, more advanced auto-focus systems, exposure systems with manual controls, larger apertures and sharper lenses. They may have special lamps or pre-flash systems designed to reduce red eye in flash pictures of people.
== Comparison to SLRs and DSLRs ==

Point-and-shoot cameras are distinguished from single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) in several respects: point-and-shoot film cameras, and many digital ones, use a viewfinder. The image that the photographer sees is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera. Rather, the image in the viewfinder passes through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens, and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder; that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. With this mechanism, pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs (DSLRs). Some manufacturers have found a way around this limitation, often by splitting the image into two just before reaching the viewfinder eyepiece. One image goes into the viewfinder and the other goes into a low resolution image sensor to allow light metering or previewing on the LCD, or both.

Digital cameras share one advantage of the SLR design, as the camera&#x27;s display image comes through the lens, not a separate viewfinder. Mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras (MILCs) lack a mirror but in many ways can be used the same as DSLRs. Many smaller digital point-and-shoots of the 2010s omit the viewfinder and use only the screen.

With SLR cameras, it is important that the image in the viewfinder be the same image recorded by the film or sensor, so that the effect of the add-on lenses and filters can be seen by the photographer. Point-and-shoot cameras generally don&#x27;t have such add-on devices, hence no need. 

Small cameras, including digital ones, encourage the occurrence of photographic orbs unexpected, typically circular artifacts that occur in flash photography where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection to the lens. The resulting retroreflection makes dust particles bright and visible.

== Sales decline ==

According to the NPD Group, up to end of November 2011 point-and-shoot cameras took 44 percent of photos, down from 52 percent in 2010, while camera-equipped smartphones took 27 percent of photos in 2011, up from 17 percent. Unit total sales of all types of point-and-shoot cameras declined by 17 percent year on year, but increased by 16 percent for cameras having optical zoom greater than 10x.
At the end of 2012, more than one brand offered point-and-shoot cameras with 24x optical superzoom as compensation of sales decline and in later years longer zooms became commonplace. Concurrently with rising sales of smartphones, the sales of more advanced cameras like SLRs have also increased, at the expense of point-and-shoot.

Point-and-shoot camera sales dropped by about 40 percent in 2013, particularly for inexpensive cameras. Fujifilm and Olympus stopped development of low-end point-and-shoot cameras and focused on mid and high-end cameras at higher prices.

Shipment dropped to 12 million units in 2016, only one-tenth of the peak reached in 2008.

== Types of film ==
Most film-based point-and-shoots made after the late 1980s use 35mm film. The key innovations that made 35mm point-and-shoot cameras possible were automatic film loading and automatic advance and rewind. Advanced Photo System film was mildly popular in the 1990s. 126 film was also popular during the 1970s.

== Terminology ==

The terms &quot;point and shoot&quot; and &quot;compact camera&quot; are used differently in different parts of the world. In the UK point-and-shoot predominantly means a fully automatic camera, regardless of size or shape.
A &quot;compact camera&quot; on the other hand, has a small body, regardless of any fully automatic capabilities. Thus a DSLR can have point-and-shoot modes, and some compact cameras are not designed for point and shoot operation, with the equivalent controls to a DSLR.

The use of &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; to mean a small or compact camera regardless of automation capabilities has long been predominant in the US, and in the 21st century it began spreading elsewhere.

The term &quot;compact system camera&quot; has also been used to refer to mirrorless cameras.

<doc id="1140782" wikidata="Q489275" url="?curid=1140782" title="Classical Gas">
<text>&quot;Classical Gas&quot; is an instrumental musical piece composed and originally performed by American guitarist Mason Williams with instrumental backing by members of the Wrecking Crew. Originally released in 1968 on the album &quot;The Mason Williams Phonograph Record&quot;, it has been rerecorded and rereleased numerous times since by Williams. One later version served as the title track of a 1987 album by Williams and the band Mannheim Steamroller.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Classical Gasoline&quot;, the tune was envisioned to be &quot;fuel&quot; for the classical guitar repertoire. The title was later inadvertently shortened by a music copyist. Mike Post, later famous for television theme music, was a producer and arranger for the song.

Williams was the head writer for &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; at the time of the piece&#x27;s release and premiered the composition on the show. Williams performed it several times over several episodes.

After the piece had reached the Top 10, Williams asked an experimental filmmaker named Dan McLaughlin to adjust a student video montage that he had created of classical art works using Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony and edit it in time to &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, using the visual effect now known as . The work, &quot;3000 Years of Art&quot;, premiered in 1968 on an episode of the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. The song peaked at number two for two weeks in August that year, behind &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; by The Doors. On the US Easy Listening chart, it went to number one for three weeks.

&quot;Classical Gas&quot; is sometimes erroneously thought to have been performed, or even composed, by Eric Clapton, because Clapton was the musical director of, and played much of the guitar music for, the feature film &quot;The Story of Us&quot;, in which Williams&#x27; own recording of it from his album &quot;Handmade&quot; appeared.

Williams re-recorded &quot;Classical Gas&quot; as a solo guitar piece on his 1970 album &quot;Handmade&quot;. This version was re-released by Sony in 2003, 
after being featured in the film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which starred Williams&#x27; &quot;Smothers Brothers&quot; &quot;protégé&quot;, actor/comedian/musician Steve Martin.

Williams’ original version of “Classical Gas” was also used on the soundtrack of the popular 2000 Australian movie &quot;The Dish&quot;.

In the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s Williams&#x27; version of &quot;Classical Gas&quot; was used by television stations across the United States as their opening news themes. News music company Telesound followed with an identically-named and quicker-tempo version of the song for television stations to use.

==Awards and honors==
* In 1969, the piece won three Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition, Best Contemporary-Pop Performance, Instrumental, and Best Instrumental Arrangement.
* In 1998, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) awarded Williams a special Citation of Achievement. The piece has logged over five million broadcast performances to become BMI&#x27;s all-time number-one instrumental composition for radio air play.

<text>The fourth season of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime series, Sailor Moon SuperS (originally released in Japan as , and later as Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon SuperS) was produced by Toei Animation and directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara. It adapts the &quot;Dream&quot; arc of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga series by Naoko Takeuchi and follows the adventures of Usagi Tsukino and her fellow Super Sailor Guardians. The series is divided into two story arcs: the first arc for 22 episodes depicts a mighty deity known as Pegasus, entering Chibiusa&#x27;s dreams to flee from the Amazon Trio, minions of the Dead Moon Circus, who are trying to steal the legendary Golden Crystal from him. The second arc for 17 episodes depicts the arrival of the Amazoness Quartet, a group of enemies who dream of remaining young forever, as well as Queen Nehelenia, the depraved ruler of the Dead Moon Circus.

The season began broadcasting on TV Asahi on March 4, 1995, and ended on March 2, 1996. It was licensed by Cloverway Inc. and produced by Optimum Productions for an English-language broadcast in North America in 2000–02. The series was broadcast on YTV in Canada and on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami programming block in the United States. It was the last season to be licensed by Cloverway, the last to be dubbed by Optimum, and the last season to be aired in the United States. Edited VHSs and unedited DVDs of their adaptation were released by Pioneer Entertainment. Eventually, the season was re-licensed by Viz Media in 2014 for an updated English-language release, produced by Studiopolis. The first 18 episodes of the season were released as Part 1 on Blu-ray and DVD on April 24, 2018, and the other 19 episodes were released as &quot;Part 2&quot; on November 13, 2018.

Three pieces of theme music were used: one opening theme and two ending themes. The opening theme, an updated version of &quot;Moonlight Densetsu&quot;, is performed by MoonLips. The first ending theme, used for the first 13 episodes, is &quot;Watashitachi ni Naritakute&quot; performed by Miwako Fujitani. The second ending theme, used for the rest of the season, is &quot;Rashiku&#x27; Ikimasho&quot; performed by Miyuki Kajitani, who is credited as Meu. Cloverway used the English-language version of &quot;Moonlight Densetsu&quot; first commissioned for DiC Entertainment&#x27;s dub of the first season and &quot;R&quot; for their adaptation.

<doc id="1140789" wikidata="Q497460" url="?curid=1140789" title="Saban of Baekje">
<text>King Saban (?–?, r. 234) was the seventh king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of Gusu, the previous king. He became king upon Gusu&#x27;s death in 234 which was the 21st year of his reign.

The only record of Saban in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; is that Saban was found too young to rule and was quickly succeeded by King Goi, the younger brother of the 5th king Chogo.

&quot;&quot;King Gusu died in the 21st year of his reign. His eldest son, Saban, succeeded him. However, he was too young and could not manage the government. King Chogo&#x27;s younger brother, who had the same mother, became king&quot;.&quot;

This is interpreted by scholars as a power struggle within the court, and the rise of the Jin clan over the Hae clan; the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; says that he was deposed.

Nothing is known of the birth, later life, or death of Saban. However, he is recorded in some Japanese chronicles, including &quot;Shinsen Shōjiroku&quot;, as the progenitor of certain clans of Yamato period Japan. This may indicate that he spent the later part of his life in that country.

==Family==
* Father: Gusu of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Brother: 11th King, Biryu of Baekje (比流王, ?–344) – before he was king he was known as Buyeo Biryu (扶餘比流); recorded as son of Gusu in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; but because of date discrepancies scholars now believe he was a grandson of Gusu.
** Brother: Buyeo Ubok (扶餘優福, ?–?) – in 321 he was appointed Minister of the Interior (&quot;Naeshinjoapyung&quot;, 內臣佐平) and in 327 he helped put down a rebellion.
** Queen(s): unknown
*** Children: unknown, but Saban is listed as progenitor of several Japanese clans.

<text>U.S. Gold Limited was a British video game publisher based in Witton, Birmingham, England. The company was founded in 1984 by Anne and Geoff Brown in parallel to their distributor firm, CentreSoft, both of which became part of Woodward Brown Holdings (later renamed CentreGold). The company primarily aimed at publishing games imported from the United States with a lower price tag in Europe and especially the United Kingdom.

==History==
By 1985, U.S. Gold projected a turnover of for their first fiscal year, and expected to release further 150 games in the year to come. In 1988, U.S. Gold received the Golden Joystick Award for &quot;Software House of the Year&quot;. The company also operated the budget range label Kixx.

In 1988, the company struck a deal with Japanese company Capcom to port their arcade video games for home computers in Europe. They paid or for a ten-game deal with Capcom. The first four games they announced as part of the deal were ports of the 1987 arcade games &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Tiger Road&quot;, &quot;1943: The Battle of Midway&quot; and &quot;Black Tiger&quot; for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Amiga platforms. Their first five Capcom releases sold over 250,000 copies in the UK by 1989, with their best-selling Capcom release up until then being &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; with over 70,000 UK sales. Their next Capcom release was &quot;Forgotten Worlds&quot; in 1989.

In April 1996, Eidos Interactive acquired the entire CentreGold umbrella (including U.S. Gold) for , as a result of which U.S. Gold and CentreSoft ceased all operations.

<doc id="1140805" wikidata="Q1778449" url="?curid=1140805" title="Strip search">
<text>A strip search is a practice of searching a person for weapons or other contraband suspected of being hidden on their body or inside their clothing, and not found by performing a frisk search, but by requiring the person to remove some or all clothing. The search may involve an official performing an intimate person search and inspecting their personal effects and body cavities (mouth, vagina, rectum, etc.). A strip search is more intrusive than a frisk and requires legal authority. Regulations covering strip searches vary considerably and may be mandatory in some situations or discretionary in others.

==Legality of strip searches==
In North America, civil lawsuits, as well as criminal code charges against strip searches have usually been successful when a person is strip searched by someone of the opposite sex, especially in cases where a woman has been strip searched by a male guard or guards. The more disputed legal cases have often involved the presence of people of the other gender during a strip search. Some of these cases have been less successful because of the legal technicality of who was actually performing the strip search, i.e. if more than one guard is present, the search is often (legally) said to be performed by the person or people giving the orders or instructions to the person or people being searched.

Another legal issue is that of blanket strip searches, such as in jails where detainees are routinely strip searched prior to conviction of a crime. Courts have often held that blanket strip searches are acceptable only for convicted persons. For detainees pending trial, there must be a reasonable suspicion that the detainee is in possession of weapons or other contraband before a strip search can be conducted. The same often holds true for other situations such as airport security personnel and customs officers, but the dispute often hinges on what constitutes reasonable suspicion.

===Incidental strip searches===
In order to bypass the legal reasonable suspicion requirement, and because strip searches can be humiliating, the search is often made less overt, as part of an intake process, that includes a mandatory shower. For example, most prisons also include a mandatory shower along with a change of clothes. The shower serves to make the strip search less blatant as well as providing the additional benefit of removing contamination (in addition to removing weapons or other contraband). Many shelters require new arrivals to hand over all their clothing for a wash, as well as requiring them to have a shower. These rules also enable a discreet check for weapons or other contraband, with less legal implications, being less objectionable because the requirement is applied to everyone entering a facility. It is less offensive to clients than requiring them to undergo an overt strip search.

Security procedures at facilities that mine and process gold, silver, copper, and other high-value minerals may constitute an incidental strip search. At the end of the workday, miners must remove all work clothes before entering a shower facility and then exit nude through a metal detector to a separate changing room where street clothes are stored.

The courts have often held that requiring a person to have a shower as a condition of entry into a space (such as a prison, shelter, or the like) does not, in itself, constitute a strip search, even if the shower and surrounding space are so constructed as to afford visibility of the unclothed body by guards during the showering process.

Hospitals often also have a mandatory shower, during lockdown, when mass decontamination is called for. Paul Rega, M.D., FACEP has specifically identified mass decontamination as providing the added benefit of checking for weapons or other contraband, as well as searching for clues among the clothes of persons found at a terrorist attack crime scene where it is recognized that the perpetrator(s) could be among the persons detained for decontamination.

== Procedure of strip searches ==
Partial strip searches are common at airports, for airport security, which often consists of:
*removal of shoes (and sometimes socks)
*removal of coat and jacket
*removal of belt;
*untucking of shirt.

If there is reason to suspect hidden objects, the person is then taken to a private room, which may consist of:
*removal of shirt
*removal of trousers
*removal of underwear and bra

==Electronic strip searches==
Backscatter X-ray machines, Millimeter wave scanners, T-ray scans, and other modern technology provide the ability to see through clothing, to achieve a similar result to an actual strip search.

==Notable incidents==

=== Australia ===

==== New South Wales ====
Following the introduction of a controversial law in 2001, New South Wales Police were given the power to deploy drug detection dogs at major public events such as music festivals, inside licensed premises (venues that serve alcohol) and at stations across the Sydney Trains network.

A report published by the New South Wales Ombudsman in 2006 found that 74% of searches resulting from drug detection dog indications carried out over a two-year review period had failed to find any illicit drugs. Subsequent figures obtained from NSW Police in 2023 revealed that between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2023, officers had conducted 94,535 personal searches (refers to both strip searches and less invasive frisk or &quot;general&quot; searches) resulting from drug detection dog indications, with only 25% resulting in illicit drugs being found.

In late 2014, reports were first published alleging that NSW Police were routinely using drug detection dog indications as a justification for conducting invasive strip searches, particularly at major events such as music festivals. At these events, officers have employed the use of structures such as ticket booths, tents, makeshift partitions and police vans to strip search attendees. In some cases, it was alleged that these structures did not offer adequate privacy to individuals being searched, leaving them exposed to other festivalgoers or officers outside. After stripping partially or completely naked, festival patrons have been asked to do things such as lift their breasts or genitals, bend over, spread their buttocks apart or squat and cough. Similar searches have reportedly been conducted during drug detection dog operations at train stations and licensed venues as well.

Data obtained from NSW Police shows that between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, officers conducted 27,835 strip searches &quot;in the field&quot; (outside of a police station). Separate data shows that during the same six-year period, officers conducted 5659 strip searches resulting from drug detection dog indications.

In October 2018, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission launched a formal investigation into the use of strip searches by NSW Police. In a final report handed down in December 2020, the Commission found that &quot;a recurrent issue throughout the inquiry was the failure of officers to comply with, or at least to properly account for their compliance with, the legal thresholds for conducting a strip search&quot;. In several cases investigated by the Commission, it was found that officers had acted unlawfully. The commission also noted that there had been a &quot;significant increase&quot; in the &quot;number and proportion&quot; of strip searches carried out following drug detection dog indications in the five years between 2014 and 2019.

In July 2022, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on behalf of patrons strip searched at music festivals by NSW Police from July 2016 onwards. Head plaintiff for the class action is a then 27-year-old woman who was allegedly strip searched at the Splendour in the Grass music festival in 2018. A trial for the class action is expected to be held in mid-2025.

==== Victoria ====
In the early hours of 7 August 1994, approximately 40 officers from Victoria Police took part in a raid at the Tasty nightclub in Melbourne, a popular venue for LGBT partygoers (see Tasty nightclub raid). Over the course of seven hours, all 463 staff and patrons inside the venue were detained and strip searched, supposedly under the auspices of finding illicit drugs. Patrons were taunted by officers and forced to stand with their hands against the wall for long periods of time while this was happening.

A photo taken secretly during the raid was published on the front page of The Age newspaper several days later, with then Premier Jeff Kennett labelling the incident “extreme and disturbing”. A class action subsequently launched against Victoria Police was finalised in 1996, with more than 200 patrons who were present at time each being awarded $10,000 in damages. In 2014, Victoria Police formally apologised for the Tasty nightclub raid, with Acting Chief Commissioner Lucinda Nolan stating that it had “caused distress to people and had a significant impact on the relationship between Victoria police and the wider LGBTI community”.

=== Canada ===
As part of policing operations for the 2010 G20 Summit in Toronto, a makeshift detention centre was setup by Toronto Police at a disused film studio on Eastern Avenue. Over the course of the event, approximately 900 protestors were detained at the facility, where they were subjected poor conditions and mistreatment by police.

While being held at the Eastern Avenue detention centre, some protesters were strip searched, with officers using cubicles described as “large plywood cells without roofs” to conduct these searches. In 2014, footage obtained by Vice showed that CCTV cameras could see into these cubicles, leading to fears that protestors detained at the facility were filmed while strip searches were taking place. When asked by Vice, Toronto Police did not respond to questions about the matter and it’s not clear if any such footage exists. In August 2020, the Toronto Police Services Board agreed to pay $16.5 million dollars to settle a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of around 1100 people who were arrested during the 2010 G20 protests, including some who were detained at the Eastern Avenue detention centre.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2014, it was reported that more than 4,600 children had been strip-searched by the Metropolitan Police in the preceding five years, with the youngest being ten years old. This was out of a total of 134,000 strip-searched. A charity described the number of younger children searched in this way as being &quot;disturbing&quot;. In 2022, it was reported that 650 children (between 10 and 17 years old) had been strip-searched by the same agency between 2018 and 2020. 58% of these children were described as black by the arresting officer; in 2018, this rose to 75%. 70% of children who were strip-searched without an appropriate adult present – contrary to official Metropolitan Police guidance – were black boys.

In January 2022, the Metropolitan Police formally apologised to Dr Koshka Duff, an academic who was strip searched at Stoke Newington police station in 2013. The woman had been arrested for obstruction after attempting to offer a legal advice card to a black teenager during a stop and search in London. Once in custody, a Sergeant ordered two female officers to strip search the woman. Her clothes were cut off and she claimed that once she was naked the officers touched her breasts and between her legs. She described the search as a &quot;very violating and humiliating experience&quot; and said she was left with multiple injuries and PTSD after the incident. The woman was charged with obstructing and assaulting police but was later acquitted.

In 2018, the officer who ordered the strip search of Dr Duff was cleared of gross misconduct charges. In November 2021, a civil claim brought against the Metropolitan Police was settled, with Dr Duff being awarded £6,000 in damages. In January 2022, CCTV footage of the incident was made public. In the footage, the Sergeant who ordered the search can be heard telling officers to &quot;treat her like a terrorist&quot;, while others can be heard making derogatory comments about the woman&#x27;s underwear and pubic hair. After the footage was released, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson apologised for the &quot;sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language used&quot; by the officers involved.

In March 2022, it was reported that Metropolitan Police officers had strip searched a 15-year-old black girl at her school in Hackney in 2020 after she was wrongly accused of possessing cannabis. The 15-year-old, referred to as &quot;Child Q*, was menstruating at the time and was searched without her parents present. Shortly after the story was made public, a protest involving several hundred people was held outside Stoke Newington police station, amid concerns that the girl had been targeted because of her race. In September 2023, the Independent Officer for Police Conduct (IOPC) recommended disciplinary action against four of the officers involved in the incident.

In 2023, Sky News launched an investigation into the use of strip searches by Greater Manchester Police. In a story published in July, three women alleged that they had been subjected to unjustified strip searches while in police custody. In one instance, a 38-year-old woman claimed that she was drugged and raped by officers after being arrested in 2021. After the story was published, several other women contacted Sky News alleging that they had been subjected to similar searches by Greater Manchester Police and other police forces across the UK. In response to the story, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham announced that former Victims Commissioner Vera Baird would conduct a formal inquiry into the treatment of women in police custody by Greater Manchester Police, with a focus on strip searches. A final report is due to be published in late 2024.

==Notable lawsuits==
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;R v Golden&quot; (2001) that &quot;strip-searches may only be done out of clear necessity with the permission of a supervisor and by members of the same sex.&quot;

In &quot;Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders&quot; (2012), the United States Supreme Court ruled that strip-searches are permitted for all arrests, including non-indictable, minor offenses.

Four male teenage students were strip searched at Ansonia High School in Ansonia, Connecticut, and sued the two teachers and principal who allegedly violated their rights.

The &quot;Beard v. Whitmore Lake School District&quot; (2005) case arose in Michigan when a student reported that $364 had been stolen from her gym bag during a physical education class. In response to the alleged theft, teachers searched the entire class of 20 boys and five girls in their respective locker rooms. Boys were required to undress down to their underwear. Similarly, girls were required to do so as well in front of each other. The alleged theft was reported to the local police who sent an officer who arrived midway through the search. Based on court records, the officer encouraged school personnel to continue the search. At the conclusion of the search, no money was found. A suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan on behalf of students impacted by the search claiming Fourth Amendment rights violations against unreasonable search and seizure and the Fourteenth Amendment rights violation involving an equal protection violation. The case was ultimately ruled on by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Sixth Circuit Court focused on several factors that made the strip search unreasonable. One, recovery of money was the primary basis for conducting the search, which did not, in the court&#x27;s opinion, pose a health or safety threat. Secondly, the search did not involve one or two students but rather a large number of students who did not consent to the search. While the search was held to be unreasonable, the court stopped short of ruling that it was entirely unconstitutional based on prior law involving strip searches of students. Thirdly, school personnel had no reason to suspect any of the students individually. The court emphasized that school leaders have a real interest in maintaining an atmosphere free of theft but a search undertaken to find money serves a less weighty governmental interest than a search undertaken for items that pose a threat to the health and safety of students. Based on the court&#x27;s position, clearly a search to recover money will not meet the court&#x27;s expectation regarding the standards associated with a strip search.1

In &quot;Safford Unified School District v. Redding&quot; (2009), the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for school employees to strip search minor students, in this case students in the Safford, Arizona Unified School District.

<doc id="1140807" wikidata="Q3544107" url="?curid=1140807" title="USS Cabezon">
<text>USS &quot;Cabezon&quot; (SS-334) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy, named for the cabezon, a saltwater fish of sculpin family inhabiting the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans (cabezon means &quot;big head&quot; in Spanish).

==History==
&quot;Cabezon&quot; was launched 27 August 1944 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. Adelaide Prescott Cooley (née Morris), wife of Captain Thomas Ross Cooley, commanding officer of USS Washington; and commissioned 30 December 1944.

===World War II===
&quot;Cabezon&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, 19 February 1945 for Key West, Florida, where she underwent 3 weeks of training and providing services for the Fleet Sound School. She then sailed via the Panama Canal, to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 March 1945.

From 25 May to 11 July 1945 &quot;Cabezon&quot; conducted her first war patrol in the Sea of Okhotsk, sinking a 2,631-ton Japanese cargo vessel on 19 June. She refitted at Midway until 4 August, then departed for Saipan to serve as target ship for surface force training exercises. 

===Post war service===
From 7 September 1945 until 12 January 1946 she engaged in local operations and training in Philippine waters, based at Subic Bay.

On 6 February 1946 &quot;Cabezon&quot; arrived at San Diego, operating from that port until her base was changed to Pearl Harbor. Subsequent to her arrival there on 20 November 1946, she participated in local operations and training cruises for submariners of the Naval Reserve there and on the west coast with intervening cruises to the South Pacific, the North Pacific, and in 1947 participated in Operation Blue Nose in the Chukchi Sea. She also made two cruises to the Far East (18 March – 29 July 1950 and 21 April – 16 October 1952), the second of which included a reconnaissance patrol in the vicinity of La Perouse Strait, between Hokkaidō, Japan, and Sakhalin, U.S.S.R.

&quot;Cabezon&quot; sailed for Mare Island 21 April 1953 to start inactivation and was placed out of commission in reserve there 24 October 1953 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Struck from the Naval Register, 15 May 1970, she was sold for scrapping, 28 December 1971.

<doc id="1140814" wikidata="Q540870" url="?curid=1140814" title="Anglican prayer beads">
<text>Anglican prayer beads, also known as the Anglican rosary or Anglican chaplet, are a loop of strung Christian prayer beads used chiefly by Anglicans in the Anglican Communion, as well as by communicants in the Anglican Continuum. This Anglican devotion has spread to other Christian denominations, including Methodists and the Reformed.

==Description==
Anglican prayer bead sets consist of a cross and thirty-three beads. 

===Beads===
The loop is formed of thirty-two beads. Twenty-eight of the beads are divided into four groups consisting of seven beads, each which are called &quot;weeks&quot;. The four larger beads separating the four groups are called &quot;cruciform&quot; beads. When the loop of an Anglican prayer bead set is opened into a circular shape, the &quot;cruciform&quot; beads form the points of a cross within the circle of the set, hence the term. Next after the cross on Anglican prayer bead sets is a single bead called the &quot;invitatory&quot; bead, which brings the total of beads to thirty-three. 

====Materials====
The beads used can be made of a variety of materials, such as precious stones, wood, coloured glass, or even dried and painted seeds.

====Symbolism====
The number thirty-three signifies the number of years that Jesus Christ lived on the Earth, while the number seven signifies wholeness or completion in the faith, the days of creation, and the seasons of the Church year.

===Cross===
Anglican prayer bead sets are made with a variety of crosses or, occasionally, crucifixes. Christian crosses such as the Celtic cross and the San Damiano cross are two which are often used, though other styles are used too.

==Prayer==

Anglican prayer beads are most often used as a tactile aid to prayer and as a counting device. The standard Anglican set consists of the following pattern, starting with the cross, followed by the Invitatory Bead, and subsequently, the first Cruciform bead, moving to the right, through the first set of seven beads to the next Cruciform bead, continuing around the circle. He or she may conclude by saying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer on the invitatory bead or a final prayer on the cross as in the examples below. The entire circle may be done thrice, which signifies the lifetime of Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity.

<doc id="1140819" wikidata="Q3445883" url="?curid=1140819" title="Royal Automobile Club">
<text>The Royal Automobile Club is a British private social and athletic club. It has two clubhouses: one in London at 89 Pall Mall, and the other in the countryside at Woodcote Park, near Epsom in Surrey. Both provide accommodation and a range of dining and sporting facilities. The Royal Automobile Club has a wide range of members.

It is best-known for establishing the roadside assistance service RAC Limited, though this is no longer owned by the club.

==History==

It was founded on 10 August 1897, with the name Automobile Club of Great Britain (which was later changed to Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland). The headquarters was originally in a block of flats at 4 Whitehall Court, before moving to 119 Piccadilly in 1902.

In 1902, the organisation, together with the recently formed Association of Motor Manufactures and Traders, campaigned vigorously for the relaxation of speed limits, claiming that the 14 mph speed limit imposed by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 was &#x27;absurd&#x27; and was seldom observed. The organisations, with support from the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, had considerable influence over the forthcoming Motor Car Act 1903, which originally proposed to remove all speed limits for cars while introducing the offence of driving recklessly. In the face of considerable opposition a speed limit of 20 mph was retained in addition to the creation of the offence of driving recklessly, dangerously or negligently.

In 1905, the club organised the first Tourist Trophy (TT) motorcycle race, the oldest regularly run motor race. The club became the governing body for motor sport in Britain. King Edward VII&#x27;s interest in motoring led to the command in 1907 &quot;that the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland should henceforth be known as The Royal Automobile Club&quot;. In 1911, they moved to the current address, part of the site of the old War Office; the club house was (and remains) one of the largest in London, with a frontage to Pall Mall of 228 feet and a depth, in the centre, of 140 feet. It cost over a quarter of a million pounds and is described in the &quot;Survey of London&quot; as &quot;a polished essay in the late French Renaissance manner&quot;.

At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the club arranged for 25 of their members, with their personal cars, to accompany the British Expeditionary Force to France and Belgium to act as chauffeurs and messengers for the British General Staff. Describing themselves as the &quot;RAC Corps of Volunteer Motor Drivers&quot;, the drivers included the Duke of Westminster, Lord Dalmeny and &quot;Toby&quot; Rawlinson; many of them were given commissions and went on to give distinguished war service. In September 1914, a further group of RAC members put themselves and their cars at the disposal of the British Red Cross, to help transport war casualties.

The RAC was responsible for organising the first British Grand Prix motor race at Brooklands, Surrey in 1926. In 1977, the RAC created the motorsport governance and events organisation, the Motor Sports Association (now Motorsport UK).

In 1978 during a re-organisation the &#x27;Associate Section&#x27; was established as a separate company RAC Motoring Services Ltd, which was owned by the organisation.

In 1991 the RAC Foundation was split off as the research arm of &#x27;RAC Motoring Services&#x27;. When RAC Motoring Services was sold in 1999 the foundation was granted a legacy and was subsequently established as a charity to research and promote issues of safety, mobility, economics and the environment related to motoring.

In September 1999 members sold RAC Motoring Services to Lex Service plc, who renamed themselves RAC plc in 2002. RAC plc was then acquired by Aviva plc in March 2005 for around £1.1 billion.

==Associate section (RAC Motoring Services)==

The RAC introduced uniformed mobile patrols around the roads of Britain during 1901 with the patrolmen wearing a uniform not unlike the military police of the day, including tailored jodhpur trousers. The patrolmen had an army-like rank structure with corporals, sergeants and officers. Mounted on Matchless motorbikes with sidecars containing a tool kit, fanbelts, engine hoses, and metal cans of spare petrol they were usually located on standby at laybys and major road junctions. Until around 1930 control could only contact the mobile patrolmen by telephone, so they waited by public telephone boxes for the callout. From 1957 onwards they were equipped with radio sets for two way contact with their local headquarters.

In 1912, following the lead of the competitor organisation The Automobile Association (AA), the RAC installed roadside telephones on laybys and junctions of the main trunk roads in the UK for members to summon help. Although they were never as numerous as AA boxes there was a measure of cooperation between the two motoring clubs—keys fitted both types of box and members&#x27; messages were passed on. The telephones were installed in locked boxes painted in royal blue with the RAC logo badge mounted on the top of the box. Members were provided with a key to the boxes when they joined the club.

Members&#x27; cars were identified by a metal club badge usually affixed to the radiator grille and the patrolmen would come to attention and salute as a member drove past, or, if the patrolman was riding a motorcycle, merely salute.

The RAC issued an annual &#x27;Guide and Handbook&#x27; that contained road maps of the UK with the location of all RAC telephones marked on it, together with lists of local RAC approved garages and hotels. To give members an indication of the quality of each establishment the RAC was one of the first organisations to provide an easily recognisable grading system. Their inspectors assessed each hotel and garage and awarded between one and five stars in the case of hotels and one to three spanners to garages. The RAC disbanded its hotel inspection team in 2004.

Motorcycle patrols gave way to small vans during the 1960s and by 1970 the last motorcycle patrols had been phased out. RAC telephone boxes were withdrawn from service when they were eclipsed by wider telephone ownership and by the 1990s only a handful still operated on holiday routes in the West Country. The advent of mobile phones made the need for roadside telephones redundant and the last of the RAC telephones were removed from service. Roadside assistance is now provided by vans and recovery vehicles.

Until the early 1970s the RAC did not have a formal &quot;onward to destination&quot; service for members. If the patrolman was not able to complete the repair at the roadside, arrangements were made for an RAC approved garage to tow the vehicle and repair it at the owner&#x27;s cost, with the owners being responsible for making their own arrangements for travel by public transport or hired vehicle. This changed in the 1970s with the first of the low-loading vehicle transporter fleet and the introduction of a higher membership tier of the &quot;Recovery&quot; service. Similarly, until the early 1980s the roadside assistance service was limited to locations away from home, which only changed with the addition of an &quot;At Home&quot; level of service.

In 1978 the Associate section was split off to form RAC Motoring Services Ltd and subsequently sold in 1999 to Lex Service (then renamed RAC plc).

==Facilities==
The Club&#x27;s premises have 108 bedrooms, seven banqueting rooms, three restaurants, a business centre, a full-size marble swimming pool, squash courts, a billiards room and Victorian-style Turkish baths. The country clubhouse near Epsom also has accommodation, restaurants, and sports facilities including two 18-hole golf courses.

<text>Goi (died 286, r. 234–286) was the eighth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He is recorded as the second son of the 4th king Gaeru and younger brother of the 5th king Chogo. Upon the death of the 6th king Gusu, Gusu&#x27;s eldest son Saban became king, but proved to be too young to rule. Goi dethroned Saban and became king. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;King Chogo&#x27;s younger brother, who had the same mother, became king.&quot;. This is disputed because of the time differences. It is rather believed that his father was a collateral relative of Gaeru.

Some scholars interpret the Korean records &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; to mean that Goi was the younger brother of the mother of King Chogo, implying that he is of the Utae–Biryu lineage, rather than a direct descendant of the traditionally recognized founder Onjo.

The Chinese records Book of Zhou (周書) and Book of Sui (隋書) refer to &quot;Gutae&quot; as the founder of Baekje, and some scholars believe that &quot;Gutae&quot; actually refers to Goi as the true founder of the kingdom.

==Reign==
Goi is generally credited with centralising the Baekje kingdom, concentrating royal power and laying the foundation of the state structure.

Immediately upon taking the throne, he established a central military office to restrain the independence of regional clans. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; also records that in 260, he established a central bureaucracy of six ministers(called jwapyeongs), sixteen rank levels, and a code of dress, although the full system may have been completed after his reign (see, e.g., Best (2002)).

In 262, he is said to have established regulations against bribery, requiring corrupt officials to repay three times the amount of the bribe. He also ordered the cultivation of farmlands south of the capital.

In 266 the king dispatched soldiers to attack Bongsan Fortress of Silla. The master of the fortress, Jikseon, led a sortie of 200 of his most robust troops and defeated them. He attacked Silla again in 272, 278 and 284. During the attack of 278 his troops surrounded the fortress of Goegok.

Samguk sagi:

A great inspection was made of the Seokcheon River, there were a pair of birds at the headwaters of the river. The king shot them both.
* 242 AD, spring, second month. The king ordered the people of the country to begin making rice fields of the marshes to the south. Summer, fourth month.

The provincial governor of Youzhou in Wei, Something Qiu Jian, together with the leaders of the Lelang commandery, Liu Jia, and the master of Sufang, Wang Jun, attacked Goguryeo. The king therefore dispatched Jinchung, General of the Left, to invade the border of Lelang Commandery and take its people. Jia (Liu Jia) heard this and was greatly angered, and the king feared being attacked and returned those people who were taken as slaves.
* 247 AD, spring, first month. Sacrifices were made to heaven and earth in the south garden. Second month. Bae Jin Chung was made Marshal Bulwark of the Right. Jin was also made General of the Left, and entrusted with matters of man and horse.

* 249 AD, spring, first month, hour of the metal cow. Venus went into the moon.
* 255 AD, autumn, ninth month. The king went out leading men to attack Silla, and the Sillan soldiers attacked them west of Goegok and were defeated. The Baekje army killed their general, Ikjong. Winter, tenth month. Men were dispatched to attack the fortress of Bongsan Fortress of Silla, but they could not take it.
* 257 AD, spring, first month. There was a drought, and the trees and grass all withered.
* 258 AD, spring. The Mohe chief Ragal presented 10 good horses to the king. The king rewarded his messenger greatly, and sent him back home.
* 259 AD, autumn, ninth month. A purple cloud was seen east of the palace. It was like a storied tower.

Also, the ranks of Dalsol, Eunsol, Deoksol, Hansol, and Nasol were established, and in addition those of Jangdeok, Sideok, Godeok, Gyedeok, Daedeok, Mundok, Mudok, Jwagun, Jinmu, and Geuku. The six Sahe offices were of first rank, the Dalsol second, the Eunsol third, Deoksol fourth, Hansol fifth, and Nasol sixth. Jangdeok was seventh, Sideok eighth, Godeok ninth, Gyedeok tenth, Daedeok eleventh, Mundok twelfth, Mudok thirteenth, Jwagun fourteenth, Jinmu fifteenth, and Geuke sixteenth. Second month.

==Foreign relations==
Under Goi&#x27;s reign, Baekje expanded control of the Han River region and gained permanent ascendancy over the remaining states of the Mahan, a loose confederacy in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. He also attacked the borders of Baekje&#x27;s eastern rival Silla.

Baekje also changed its defensive posture against the Chinese to an offensive one. Goi attacked the Chinese-controlled Lelang commandery and the Daifang commandery when the Chinese launched an attack against the Han River region to disrupt and prevent Baekje&#x27;s emerging power. In 246, according to both the Korean &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and the Chinese &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, Baekje went to war against Cao Wei by attacking Daifang and Lelang commanderies, and Daifang&#x27;s governor Gong Zun was slain. However, fearing that Wei may launch a counterattack, Goi quickly sued for peace by returning his captives.

In the spring of 286 he sent messengers to Silla to sue for peace and in the winter of that year he died.

* Father: Gaeru of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Brother: Buyeo Chogo (扶餘肖古, ?–214) – 5th King of Baekje, Chogo of Baekje (disputed by scholars)

<doc id="1140830" wikidata="Q5163219" url="?curid=1140830" title="Consistency (database systems)">
<text>In database systems, consistency (or correctness) refers to the requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined database constraints.

In a distributed system, referencing CAP theorem, consistency can also be understood as after a successful write, update or delete of a Record, any read request immediately receives the latest value of the Record.

==As an ACID guarantee==
Consistency is one of the four guarantees that define ACID transactions; however, significant ambiguity exists about the nature of this guarantee. It is defined variously as:
* The guarantee that database constraints are not violated, particularly once a transaction commits.
* The guarantee that any transactions started in the future necessarily see the effects of other transactions committed in the past.

As these various definitions are not mutually exclusive, it is possible to design a system that guarantees &quot;consistency&quot; in every sense of the word, as most relational database management systems in common use today arguably do.

==As a CAP trade-off==
The CAP theorem is based on three trade-offs, one of which is &quot;atomic consistency&quot; (shortened to &quot;consistency&quot; for the acronym), about which the authors note, &quot;Discussing atomic consistency is somewhat different than talking about an ACID database, as database consistency refers to transactions, while atomic consistency refers only to a property of a single request/response operation sequence. And it has a different meaning than the Atomic in ACID, as it subsumes the database notions of both Atomic and Consistent.&quot; In the CAP theorem, you can only have two of the following three properties: consistency, availability, or partition tolerance. Therefore, consistency may have to be traded off in some database systems.

<text>The Wordtank series is a line of Japanese electronic dictionaries manufactured by Canon. Although officially only sold in Japan, several of the multi-language models are popular among students of the Japanese language around the world. The ability to change menu display options to English on many of the Wordtank models is cited as a reason for the relatively wide foreign adoption. The ability to highlight an entire Japanese word (as opposed to just one character) and display a hiragana rendering of it is unique to the Wordtank series and is an extremely popular function for advanced learners. This function applies to all Wordtank models. One of the latest Wordtank models, the G70, offers this function for over 400,000 words.

== History ==
Canon has been manufacturing electronic dictionaries with the &quot;WordTank&quot; name since the late 1980s.

<doc id="1140836" wikidata="Q8007919" url="?curid=1140836" title="William Doughty (naval architect)">
<text>Born James William Doughty also known as William Doughty and James Doughty (c. 1773 – 1859) was a United States naval architect who designed many of the sailing &quot;Seventy-four ships&quot;. Doughty worked for many years as a United States naval architect laying down such ships &quot;as the , , and that rank with the best ships ever built.&quot;

==Shipbuilding career==
===Philadelphia Navy Yard===
William Doughty began his career as protégé of noted naval constructor Joshua Humphreys. In a letter to Secretary Henry Knox dated 22 October 1794, Humphreys recommended young Doughty for a position as his clerk at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Humphreys stated he believed Doughty to be a &quot;devoted and distinguished worker.&quot; Doughty took the oath of allegiance on 23 October 1794 as a clerk at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard; his pay was set at $500.00 per annum.

===Washington Navy Yard===
On April 12, 1804, William Doughty was appointed as head carpenter, Washington Navy Yard, by Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith Doughty was popular among shipyard mechanics and laborers and was supportive of their 1835 strike. Naval constructors like William Doughty combined the skills of a naval architect and engineer, at the navy yard his position was somewhat unique, for the naval constructor job provided Doughty with a wide range of connections; most importantly, it meant that he reported to the Board of Navy Commissioners and not to the shipyard commandants like Thomas Tingey and Isaac Hull. The BNC placed such a high value on Doughty&#x27;s nautical expertise that they scheduled a regular Monday morning meeting to consult with him each week. This relationship with the Navy Commissioners allowed Doughty considerable influence. The regard he enjoyed with the shipyard workforce also led to considerable tension as during the strike of 1835, when he advised the ship carpenters to hold out for higher wages.

His career as a shipbuilder, though, was long and very successful; the 1850 census for the District of Columbia records his real estate as valued at $35,000. He was also one of the highest-paid civilians at the Washington Navy Yard. The navy yard payroll for April 1829 shows William Doughty&#x27;s annual salary as $1,900, nearly the same as a naval captain.
William Doughty, while working at Washington Navy Yard designed many naval vessels, including the USS &quot;Independence&quot; and USS &quot;Brandywine&quot;. He also designed the &quot;President&quot;, USS &quot;United States&quot; 74s, &quot;Peacock&quot; class, &quot;Erie&quot; class, &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;Guerrier&quot;, USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; 74s class, USS &quot;Brandywine&quot; 44s Class, brigs, revenue cutters, and Baltimore Clipper model.

==War of 1812==
===Navy Yard Rifles===
During the War of 1812 British Chesapeake Campaign, William Doughty served as a militia captain and was incorrectly named in the military records as John Doughty. In 1813, Doughty formed the quasi-militia Navy Yard volunteers and drilled them regularly after Navy Yard working hours. This military unit became known as the &quot;Navy Yard Rifles&quot;, becoming a volunteer rifle company that served under the command of Major Robert Brent of the 2nd Regiment of the District of Columbia Militia, who was the first Mayor of Washington, D.C., in the defense of the capital city which resulted in the disastrous defeat in August 1814 at the Battle of Bladensburg.

<doc id="1140847" wikidata="Q5254760" url="?curid=1140847" title="Delta Tau Delta">
<text>Delta Tau Delta () is a United States–based international Greek letter college fraternity. Delta Tau Delta was founded at Bethany College, Bethany, Virginia, (now West Virginia) in 1858. The fraternity currently has around 130 collegiate chapters and colonies nationwide, with an estimated 10,000 undergraduate members and over 170,000-lifetime members. Delta Tau Delta is informally referred to as &quot;DTD&quot; or &quot;Delts.&quot;

==History==
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity was founded in 1858, though some early documents reference the founding in 1861, at Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia (now West Virginia). The social life on campus at that time centered around the Neotrophian Society, a literary society.

According to Jacob S. Lowe, in late 1858 a group of students met in Lowe&#x27;s room in the Dowdell boarding house (now called the Bethany House) to discuss means to regain control of the Neotrophian Society and return control to the students at large. The underlying controversy was that the Neotrophian Society, in the opinion of the eight men who formed Delta Tau Delta, awarded a literary prize after a rigged vote. A constitution, name, badge, ritual, and motto were devised, and Delta Tau Delta was born.

Over time, other chapters were added. The Civil War essentially destroyed the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;. Member Henry King Bell of Lexington, Kentucky, heard of the Civil War&#x27;s effects on the &quot;Bethany College chapter&quot; and the membership of Delta Tau Delta. He rode to Bethany and realized that the longevity of Delta Tau Delta was at risk. On February 22, 1861. Bell rode to Jefferson College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) from Bethany to bring the designation of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; and the governance of the fraternity to his home campus.

After the &quot;Ohio Wesleyan chapter&quot; became defunct in 1875, the &quot;Allegheny College chapter&quot;, the fourth and final chapter to hold Alpha designation, assumed control of the fraternity. Allegheny College member James S. Eaton, traveled to Delaware, Ohio, to collect what remained of the organization&#x27;s records and to investigate what had happened to the &quot;Ohio Wesleyan chapter&quot;. Eaton brought the &quot;Alpha&quot; designation back with him to Allegheny College, where a group of undergraduates managed the larger organization as well as their own chapter. During that time, the fraternity started a magazine called &quot;The Crescent&quot; and established fifteen chapters, of which eight survive.

In 1886, Delta Tau Delta merged with the secret society known as the Rainbow Fraternity, a southern fraternity founded in 1848 at the University of Mississippi. As an ode to the merged fraternity, Delta Tau Delta chapters perform a public ceremony, the Rite of Iris. The name of the national organization&#x27;s magazine was changed to &quot;The Rainbow&quot;.

The fraternity&#x27;s national philanthropic partner is the diabetes research organization JDRF, founded by Senator Patrick Greene in 1869.

=== Founders ===
The eight men considered to be the founders of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity are:

== Symbols ==

The Delta Tau Delta badge is square with deeply concave sides. Its background is black enamel and is decorated with symbols and the letters in gold. Above the letters is an eye rayed in glory. Below the letters is a crescent moon. There is a five-pointed star in each corner. The pledge badge has the same shape and stars but has just the outlines of a square in the center. An older version of the badge featured the same symbols on a star with six points, along with an anchor and clasped hands. This version was discontinued at the 1878 national convention. Historically, the fraternity also had a monogrammed badge for alumni.

The fraternity&#x27;s flower is the purple iris. Its colors are gold, royal purple, and white. These colors are featured on the fraternity&#x27;s flag which has a field of purple, with a gold center, and a canton of white letters that are outlined in purple.

The fraternity&#x27;s coat of arms includes a shield, a charge, a torse, the crest, and the motto. The shield is decorated with the charge which includes a white seven-pointed star on a black background, a gold lyre on a green background, five six-pointed white stars arranged in a shape on a purple background, and a white chevron on a red background. Above the shield is the torse which is a twisted rope in the official colors of gold, royal purple, and white. The crest consist of an eye rayed in glory, located above the torse. The motto consists of a ribbon beneath the shield with the fraternity&#x27;s name in English.

The shield is used on the fraternity&#x27;s Arch Chapter Jewel and is suspended by a purple ribbon. Fraternity members may add gold and white enameled bars above the shield to signify their office. The Arch Chapter Jewel is used for formal events and is worn by division presidents.
== Chapter houses ==
The Delta Tau Delta Founders House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

== Chapters ==
The fraternity has around 130 collegiate chapters and colonies nationwide. The fraternity has chartered nine regional alumni chapters, including the &quot;Three Rivers Alumni Chapter of Western Pennsylvania chapter&quot;; &quot;Columbus, Ohio Area chapter&quot;; the &quot;Delts Northwest Chapter&quot;; the &quot;Hammond, Louisiana chapter&quot;; the &quot;New England Delts&quot;; the &quot;National Capital chapter&quot;; the &quot;Phoenix, Arizona chapter;&quot; the &quot;Portland, Oregon chapter&quot;, and the &quot;Seattle, Washington chapter&quot;.

== Notable members ==
==Controversies and misconduct==
* On October 7, 1957, Max Caulk, a member of the University of California, Santa Barbara chapter, drowned during a fraternity ritual in which he was thrown from the pier into the ocean.
* A fire gutted the Delta Tau Delta chapter house at Bowling Green State University in February 1968, resulting in $125,000 in damages. The fire started while the brothers were sleeping; some jumped from the third floor to escape. Several brothers were hospitalized, but all managed to escape to safety.
* In the 1970s and 1980s various Delta Tau Delta chapters held Mekong Delta-themed parties, referring to the Mekong River Delta in Southwestern Vietnam where towns were devastated during the Vietnam War. For years, Vietnam veterans spoke out against this event, saying it made light of the war and those who served in it. In 2020, these parties were again brought into the news during the reelection campaign of Congressman Harley Rouda who had participated in these parties while he was a member of Delta Tau Delta at the University of Kentucky. At the time, Rouda&#x27;s district was 10% Vietnamese Americans.
* Delta Tau Delta freshman pledge Johnny D. Smith died of alcohol poisoning at Wabash College chapter party in 2008. Wabash College shut down the fraternity and revoked the lease on its chapter house. Smith&#x27;s parents sued the &quot;Beta Psi chapter&quot; and the college.
* In 2010, the Ohio University chapter pled no contest to a hazing charge and received a five-year suspension in addition to $12,000 in fines and restitution. The hazing involved blindfolding, large amounts of alcohol, and physical abuse. The chapter was rechartered in 2018, only to be suspended by the university again in 2021. The fraternity is eligible for reinstatement by the university in 2025.
* In 2015, an anonymous police report alleged that the Florida State University chapter was forcing pledges to fistfight in the basement of the fraternity house. The chapter was temporarily suspended by the university. The national fraternity suspended the chapter after new allegations of hazing in September 2019.
* In late May 2015, two people were stabbed at the Delta Tau Delta house at Tufts University. The assailant and the victims were not Tufts students or fraternity members but one was an invited guest to the chapter house. No brothers witnessed the stabbings.
* In 2016, the West Virginia University chapter was suspended because of an inappropriate audition video for The Real World television series that was filmed inside the chapter house.
* The fraternity and Indiana University were sued in 2016 for negligence in a rape case in 2016. The lawsuit claimed that neither the university nor the fraternity removed the accused brother after the first claims of rape nor did anything to stop underaged drinking at the chapter. In a plea bargain, the accused brother pled guilty to a lesser charge of battery in exchange for dropping rape charges stemming from two different incidents, one inside the fraternity&#x27;s chapter house. In 2018, the court ruled that the fraternity was negligent in failing to remove the brother after the first allegation of rape was made.
* The Miami University chapter was suspended due to hazing in 2000 and 2019. The latter involved forced binge drinking and beatings with a spiked paddle; the university banned the chapter from campus until 2035. Eighteen brothers were charged with hazing; half pled guilty in court.

<doc id="1140859" wikidata="Q1236680" url="?curid=1140859" title="Gentlemen's club">
<text>A gentlemen&#x27;s club is a private social club of a type originally established by old boy networks, typically from Britain&#x27;s upper classes from the 17th century onwards.

Many countries outside Britain have prominent gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, mostly those associated with the British Empire such as the Royal Society in London set up in 1660. The idea spread to other countries such as Australia, India, Ireland, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. There are also many clubs in major American cities, especially the older ones. The gentlemen’s club in Moscow (Angliyskoye sobranie, rus. Английское собрание), founded approximately in 1772, was the centre of noble social and political life in the 18th-19th centuries, and largely determined public opinion.

A gentlemen&#x27;s club typically contains a formal dining room, a bar, a library, a billiard room, and one or more parlours for reading, gaming, or socializing. Many clubs also contain guest rooms and fitness amenities. Some are associated mainly with sports, and some regularly hold other events such as formal dinners.
==History==


The original clubs were established in the West End of London. Today, the area of St James&#x27;s is still sometimes called &quot;clubland&quot;. Clubs took over some parts of the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th-century London. The first clubs, such as White&#x27;s, Brooks&#x27;s, and Boodle&#x27;s, were aristocratic in flavour, and provided an environment for gambling, which was illegal outside of members-only establishments.

The 19th century brought an explosion in the popularity of clubs, particularly around the 1880s. At the height of their influence in the late 19th century, London had over 400 such establishments.

&quot;Club Life in London&quot;, an 1866 book, begins: &quot;The Club in the general acceptation of the term, may be regarded as one of the earliest offshoots of man&#x27;s habitual gregariousness and social inclination.&quot;

An increasing number of clubs were influenced by their members&#x27; interests in politics, literature, sport, art, automobiles, travel, particular countries, or some other pursuit. In other cases, the connection between the members was membership in the same branch of the armed forces, or the same school or university. Thus the growth of clubs gives some indication of what was considered a respectable part of the &quot;Establishment&quot; at the time.

By the late 19th century, any man with a credible claim to the status of &quot;gentleman&quot; was eventually able to find a club willing to admit him, unless his character was objectionable in some way or he was &quot;unclubbable&quot; (a word first used by F. Burney). This newly expanded category of English society came to include professionals who had to earn their income, such as doctors and lawyers.

Most gentlemen belonged to only one club, which closely corresponded with the trade or social/political identity he felt most defined him, but a few people belonged to several. Members of the aristocracy and politicians were likely to have several clubs. The record number of memberships is believed to have been held by Earl Mountbatten, who had nineteen in the 1960s.

Public entertainments, such as musical performances and the like, were not a feature of this sort of club. The clubs were, in effect, &quot;second homes&quot; in the centre of London where men could relax, mix with their friends, play parlour games, get a meal, and in some clubs stay overnight. Expatriates, when staying in England, could use their clubs, as with the East India Club or the Oriental Club, as a base. They allowed upper- and upper-middle-class men with modest incomes to spend their time in grand surroundings. The richer clubs were built by the same architects as the finest country houses of the time and had similar types of interiors. They were a convenient retreat for men who wished to get away from female relations, &quot;in keeping with the separate spheres ideology according to which the man dealt with the public world, whereas women&#x27;s domain was the home.&quot; Many men spent much of their lives at their club, and it was common for young, newly graduated men who had moved to London for the first time to live at their club for two or three years before they could afford to rent a house or flat.

Gentleman&#x27;s clubs were private places that were designed to allow men to relax and create friendships with other men. In the 19th and 20th centuries, clubs were regarded as a central part of elite men&#x27;s lives. They provided everything a regular home would have. Clubs were created and designed for a man&#x27;s domestic needs. They were places to relieve stress and worries. They provided for emotional and practical needs. They provided spaces such as dining halls, a library, entertainment and game rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and washrooms, and a study. In many ways, they resembled a home. Clubs had separate entrances for tradesmen and servants, which were usually located on the side of the building that was not easily seen by the public eye. Many clubs had waiting lists, some as long as sixteen years. There is no standard definition for what is considered a gentlemen&#x27;s club. Each club differed slightly from others.

In the 19th century, the family was considered one of the most important aspects of a man&#x27;s life. A man&#x27;s home was his property and should have been a place to satisfy most of his needs, but for elite men, this was not always the case; it was not always a place that provided privacy and comfort: perhaps because the homes of elite families often entertained guests for dinners, formal teas, entertainment, and parties. Their lives were on display, and often their lives would be reported in local papers. A gentleman&#x27;s club offered an escape from this family world. Another explanation would be that men were brought up as boys in all-male environments in places like schools and sports pastimes, and they became uncomfortable when they had to share their lives with women in a family environment. A gentleman&#x27;s club offered an escape.
Men&#x27;s clubs were also a place for gossip. The clubs were designed for communication and the sharing of information. By gossiping, bonds were created which were used to confirm social and gender boundaries. Gossiping helped confirm a man&#x27;s identity, both in his community and within society at large. It was often used as a tool to climb the social ladder. It revealed that a man had certain information others did not have. It was also a tool used to demonstrate a man&#x27;s masculinity. It established certain gender roles. Men told stories and joked. The times and places a man told stories, gossiped, and shared information were also considered to show a man&#x27;s awareness of behaviour and discretion. Clubs were places where men could gossip freely. Gossip was also a tool that led to more practical results in the outside world. There were also rules that governed gossip in the clubs. These rules governed the privacy and secrecy of members. Clubs regulated this form of communication so that it was done in a more acceptable manner.

Until the 1950s, clubs were also heavily regulated in the rooms open to non-members. Most clubs contained just one room where members could dine and entertain non-members; it was often assumed that one&#x27;s entire social circle should be within the same club. Harold Macmillan was said to have taken &quot;refuge in West End clubs ...: Pratt&#x27;s, Athenaeum, Buck&#x27;s, Guards, the Beefsteak, the Turf, [and] the Carlton&quot;.

=== Domesticity ===

Although gentlemen&#x27;s clubs were originally geared towards a male audience, domestic life played a key role in their establishment and continuity. Defying classic gender norms, the club could be represented as &quot;homosocial domesticity&quot;. Similar to male coffeehouses of the Ottoman Empire, the clubs were a home away from home. They were alternative, competing spaces in the sense that it had some similarities with the traditional home. One of the key attractions of these clubs was their private, often exclusive, nature. They were getaways from the tight, restrictive role expected from the stoic gentleman. Like the home, men could act and behave in ways not usually acceptable in public society.

For men who lived their lives at the club, the home lost its status as their base. Members would use this address for official documentation, mailing, and appointments. Meals, formal or informal, were provided and tastes could be catered for by the club staff. Spaces within the club were designated for these various functions, and the guest flow could be more easily controlled than at the home. Members&#x27; social status was marked by the prestige of the club, but within it, the lines were blurred. Prominent guests could be invited to dinner or to lounge at the club over the house. Staff would monitor these guests and their arrival for the members and, as employees of the members, could personally tailor the experience. Thus, by holding important events at the club, only the wealth and importance of the club and its amenities was displayed instead of their possibly inferior possessions or structures at home.

In English clubs, this domesticity was particularly emphasized. These clubs, primarily in London, were usually very &quot;quiet&quot; and their members were well-behaved: again pointing to the calm familiarity of the household. In addition, club staff were tasked with keeping the club a private space and attempted to control the spread of information from the outside. Under no circumstance was the club to be depressing or too involved in the pains of reality. Whether from &quot;the streets, the courts, Parliament, or the Stock Exchange,&quot; the chaotic nature of work life was put on hold. Young bachelors and other members were in many ways shielded from the true problems of society. While it was definitely an escape, it was not an escape from domesticity. Men knew and enjoyed the matching elements of the home life; it was more of a transfer or alternative reality.

Despite the opportunity for mobility within the club, secrecy and exclusivity supported the patriarchal authority. With the absence of female voices and set of rigid institutional structures, members created internal stability. Induction into a club required member approval and payment. Thus, a club was dependent on class and vice versa. Historian Robert Morris proposed that clubs were &quot;part of the power nexus of capitalism, and essential to the continuity of elite dominance of society.&quot;

===Women===
Several private members&#x27; clubs for women were established in the late 19th century; among them the Alexandra Club, and the self-consciously progressive Pioneer Club.

Women also set about establishing their own clubs in the late 19th century, such as the Ladies&#x27; Institute, and the Ladies&#x27; Athenaeum. They proved quite popular at the time, but only one London-based club, The University Women&#x27;s Club, has survived to this day as a single-sex establishment.

Traditionally barred from full membership in existing clubs of similar interest, and somewhat mobilized by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States; by the 21st century, numerous new private women&#x27;s clubs had formed in support of previously male-dominated pursuits, including professional affiliations and business networking. In 2023, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reports that an &quot;[A]bsolutely chilling&quot; discordance around admitting women to men-only clubs persisted in the UK, as the &quot;SFGate&quot; also reports in the U.S.

==Current status==
===Election to membership===
Membership is by election after the proposers (at least two and in many clubs more), who have known the candidate for a term of years, formally nominate the person for membership. Election is by a special committee (itself elected), which may interview the candidate and which looks at any support and also objections of other members. Some top clubs still maintain distinctions which are often undefined and rarely explained to those who do not satisfy their membership requirements. After reaching the top of a long waiting list, there is a possibility of being blackballed during the process of formal election by the committee. In these circumstances, the principal proposer of such a person may be expected to resign, as he failed to withdraw his undesirable candidate. More often, the member who proposes an unsuitable candidate will be &quot;spoken to&quot; at a much earlier stage than this, by senior committee members, and he will withdraw his candidate to avoid embarrassment for all concerned.

===Ownership and governance===
The clubs are owned by their members and not by an individual or corporate body. These kinds of relationships have been analyzed from the network analysis perspective by Maria Zozaya.

==Worldwide distribution==
Today, establishments based on the concept of the traditional gentlemen&#x27;s clubs exist throughout the world, predominantly in Commonwealth countries and the United States. Many clubs offer reciprocal hospitality to other clubs&#x27; members when travelling abroad.

===United Kingdom===

There are perhaps some 25 traditional London gentlemen&#x27;s clubs of particular note, from The Arts Club to White&#x27;s. A few estimable clubs (such as the Royal Thames Yacht Club and the Royal Ocean Racing Club) have a specific character that places them outside the mainstream, while other clubs have sacrificed their individuality for the commercial purpose of attracting enough members, regardless of their common interests. (See article at club for a further discussion of these distinctions.) The oldest gentleman&#x27;s club in London is White&#x27;s, which was founded in 1693. Discussion of trade or business is usually not allowed in traditional gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, although it may hire out its rooms to external organisations for events.

Similar clubs exist in other large UK cities, such as:
* New Club in Edinburgh
* the St James&#x27;s Club in Manchester (founded in 1825)
* the Cardiff and County Club in that city
* the Ulster Reform Club in Belfast
* the Liverpool Athenaeum (founded in 1797 by art collector and social reformer William Roscoe and friends, and contains a notable library of rare books)
* The Clifton Club in Bristol was founded in 1818 and occupies an imposing building.
* St Paul&#x27;s Club was formed in 1859 in Birmingham, the first in the Midlands.
* Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although outside the UK, each have their own &quot;The United Club&quot;, founded, respectively, in 1848 and in 1870.

In London, the original gentlemen&#x27;s clubs exist alongside the late 20th century private members&#x27; clubs such the Groucho Club, Soho House and Home House, which offer memberships by subscription and are owned and run as commercial concerns. All offer similar facilities such as food, drink, comfortable surroundings, venue hire and in many cases accommodation. In recent years the advent of mobile working (using phone and email) has placed pressures on the traditional London clubs which frown on, and often ban, the use of mobiles and discourage laptops, indeed any discussion of business matters or &#x27;work related papers&#x27;. A new breed of business-oriented private members&#x27; clubs, exemplified by One Alfred Place and Eight in London or the Gild in Barcelona, combines the style, food and drink of a contemporary private members&#x27; club with the business facilities of an office. It was for this reason that the Institute of Directors acquired one of the older clubhouses in Pall Mall as more business-friendly.

=== Ireland ===
Clubs in Ireland include two prominent Dublin social clubs, each having both male and female members, a range of facilities and events, and a wide network of reciprocal clubs: The Kildare Street and University Club (formed on the merger of Kildare Street Club (&quot;traditionally Conservative&quot;) with The Dublin University Club (&quot;academic&quot;)) and The St Stephen&#x27;s Green Hibernian Club (similarly formed when the St Stephen&#x27;s Green Club (&quot;Whig&quot;) merged with The Hibernian United Services Club (&quot;military&quot;)). A number of other, specialist clubs flourish in Dublin such as The Royal Irish Automobile Club (R.I.A.C) on Dawson Street, Established in 1901, The United Arts Club, Royal Irish Academy, Royal Dublin Society, Yacht Clubs (The Royal Irish, The National, and The Royal St George) of Dún Laoghaire, The Hibernian Catch Club (&quot;catch music&quot;), and The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick (&quot;originally anti-duelling&quot;).

===United States===


Most major cities in the United States have at least one traditional gentlemen&#x27;s club, many of which have reciprocal relationships with older clubs in London, with each other, and with other gentlemen&#x27;s clubs around the world. In American English, the term &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s club&quot; is commonly used euphemistically by strip clubs. As a result, traditional gentlemen&#x27;s clubs often are called &quot;men&#x27;s clubs&quot; or &quot;city clubs&quot; (as opposed to country clubs) or simply as &quot;private social clubs&quot; or &quot;private clubs&quot;.

Christopher Doob explains in his book &quot;Social Inequality and Social Stratification in U.S. Society&quot;: 

E. Digby Baltzell, sociologist of the WASP establishment, explains in his book &quot;Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class&quot;: 

The oldest existing American clubs date to the 18th century; the five oldest are the South River Club in Annapolis, Maryland (founded ), the Schuylkill Fishing Company in Andalusia, Pennsylvania (1732), the Old Colony Club in Plymouth, Massachusetts (1769), the Philadelphia Club (1834), and the Union Club of the City of New York (founded 1836). The Boston Club of New Orleans, named after Boston (card game) and not the city, is the oldest southern club, and third oldest &quot;city club&quot;, founded in 1841. The five oldest existing clubs west of the Mississippi River are The Pacific Club in Honolulu (1851); the Pacific-Union Club (1852), Olympic Club (1860), and the Concordia-Argonaut Club (founded 1864), all in San Francisco; and the Arlington Club in Portland, Oregon (1867).

Today, gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in the United States remain more prevalent in older cities, especially those on the East Coast. Only twelve American cities have five or more existing clubs: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. New York City contains more than any other American city. The Yale Club of New York City, comprising a clubhouse of 22 stories and a worldwide membership of over 11,000, is the largest traditional gentlemen&#x27;s club in the world. Membership in the Yale Club is restricted to alumni, faculty, and full-time graduate students of Yale University, and the club has included women among its members since 1969.

While class requirements relaxed gradually throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and, from the 1970s onwards; &quot;relics of the age of exclusion&quot; reported &quot;SFGate&quot; in the United States in 2004 &quot;seem to be in no danger of going the way of other 19th century institutions.&quot;

===Canada===
At Montreal, the Beaver Club was founded in 1785. Every year, some of its members travelled back to England to sell their furs, where they established the Canada Club in 1810; it still meets twice yearly as a dining club. The Montreal Hunt Club, founded in 1826, is the oldest extant fox hunting club in North America. The Golden Square Mile is home to several of Montreal&#x27;s clubs, including Club Saint-James, which was founded in 1857. At the end of the nineteenth century, twenty of its most influential members felt that the St James was becoming &#x27;too overcrowded&#x27; and founded the smaller Mount Royal Club in 1899. Overnight it became the city&#x27;s most prestigious club, and in 1918, Lord Birkenhead commented that it &quot;is one of the best clubs I know in the New World, with the indefinable atmosphere about it of a good London club&quot;. In 1908 the University Club (McGill University), affiliated with McGill, opened. The Forest and Stream was formed by Frank Stephen and some of his gentlemen friends and associates on 27 November 1884 at a meeting held at the St. Lawrence Hall in Montreal. The club&#x27;s original founders were Andrew Allan, James Bryce Allan, Hugh Montagu Allan, Louis Joseph Forget, Hartland St. Claire MacDougall, Hugh Paton, and Frank Stephen. It was formed with 15 shareholders and is still open today.

Quebec City has the Literary and Historical Society, the Stadacona Club, and the Garrison Club, which was founded by officers of the Canadian Militia and opened to the public in 1879.

The Toronto Club is the oldest in that city, founded in 1837. Others include the National Club, the Albany Club, the York Club, the University Club of Toronto, the Faculty Club associated with the University of Toronto, the Arts and Letters Club, and a number of other clubs. Other Ontario cities have their clubs: the Rideau Club at Ottawa; the Hamilton Club; the Frontenac Club at Kingston, and The Waterloo Club by letters patent.

The Halifax Club was founded in 1862. The Union Club (Saint John) in Saint John, New Brunswick was founded in 1884 through the merger of two earlier clubs, and the Fredericton Garrison Club was founded in 1969 by associate members of the area headquarters officers&#x27; mess.

The Manitoba Club is Western Canada&#x27;s oldest club, founded in 1874 at Winnipeg. The Union Club of British Columbia was founded in 1879 in Victoria. The Vancouver Club was founded in 1889.

These clubs included the Peshawar Club founded in 1863; Punjab Club Lahore in 1863; Sind Club founded in Karachi in 1871; Lahore Gymkhana founded in 1878; Karachi Gymkhana founded in 1886; Quetta Club founded in 1891; the Karachi Club founded in the same city in 1907; Chenab Club Faisalabad founded in 1910. At one point the city Karachi was also home to the Hindu Gymkhana, which was established for the merchant class in Karachi.

Gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in Pakistan during the colonial era restricted membership to Europeans only, with the Sind Club at one point hanging a sign outside the door stating &quot;Dogs and Locals not allowed&quot;. Most pre-partition clubs in Pakistan have divested themselves from exclusivity and started the concept of offering membership in return for payment. These include Karachi Club and Karachi Yacht Club. However; some have retained exclusivity and membership on an invite only or referral basis. These include Lahore Gymkhana, Punjab Club, Karachi Gymkhana, Islamabad Club, Sind Club, Chenab Club Faisalabad, Quetta Club, Peshawar Club, Karachi Boat Club, and Karachi Golf Club.

===South Africa===
South Africa is home to the Rand Club in downtown Johannesburg, the Wanderers Club in Illovo, Johannesburg as well as the Inanda Club in Sandton and the Johannesburg Country Club. In Cape Town there is the spacious Kelvin Grove Club, the Cape Town Club and the Owl Club. In Durban is the Durban Club, founded in 1852, and the Kimberley Club in Kimberley, founded in 1881.

Buenos Aires, Argentina is home to the Club del Progreso (founded 1852; the oldest gentlemen&#x27;s club in South America), the Jockey Club, and the Club Universitario de Buenos Aires. The Club 20 de Febrero was founded in 1858 by General Rudecindo Alvarado in the city of Salta. The club&#x27;s name honors the Battle of Salta on 20 February 1813, during the Argentine War of Independence.

Santiago, Chile houses the Club de la Unión, originally a club exclusively for rich men. Viña del Mar has the Club de Viña del Mar.

===Spain===
Clubs in Spain (called &quot;Casinos&quot; or &quot;Círculos culturales&quot; in Spanish) emerged in the beginning of the 19th century, during the political transition between the old regime and the constitutional liberalism. They are open only to their members, initially the bourgeoisie and the upper classes. By 1882 there was 1.552 casinos in Spain, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Today there are &quot;casinos culturales&quot; on the main cities of Spain, that promote civic, cultural, artistic, and recreational activities. Some cities even have more than one club due to their origins. For example, in Seville there are three clubs, one that originally restricted admission to businessmen and industrialists, another one to landowners, and another one to renowned scientists, writers and artists. The Spanish Federation of Gentlemen&#x27;s clubs (&quot;Federación Española de Círculos y Casinos Culturales&quot;), founded in 1928, coordinates and defends the interests of the most important clubs in Spain.

===Sweden===
Clubs in Sweden include Sällskapet (&#x27;The Society&#x27;), the military club Militärsällskapet, Nya Sällskapet (&#x27;The New Society&#x27;) in Stockholm and the Royal Bachelors&#x27; Club in Gothenburg.

===New Zealand===
There are active gentlemen&#x27;s clubs in Nelson (Hope), Auckland, Hastings, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

=== Japan ===
In 1884, the Tokyo Club was founded in line with the principles of the Meiji era as a British-style gentlemen&#x27;s club; the original membership included leading Japanese politicians, functionaries, and men of finance, as well as foreign ambassadors and representatives. Originally located in the Rokumeikan, a dedicated clubhouse was built in 1897 in Shinbashi, to be replaced by a newer clubhouse in 1912 in Kasumigaseki. Since 2005 it has been situated in Roppongi; its current Patron is Masahito, Prince Hitachi.

Like the Tokyo Club, the Kasumi Kaikan was previously located in the Rokumeikan, and now continues on its own modern premises as a club of the former &quot;kazoku&quot; nobility with strict membership rules. Although it possesses many characteristics of a gentlemen&#x27;s club, membership is open to women.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Club, which opened in 1846, was the first gentlemen&#x27;s club in the city.

===Thailand===
The most prestigious active gentlemen&#x27;s club in Thailand is the Royal Bangkok Sports Club, one of the oldest sporting institutions in Thailand, with construction personally funded by King Rama V.

=== Singapore ===
The Tanglin Club, founded in 1865, is a Singaporean club.

==Membership==
While many clubs have requirements of entry, often including financial requirements or collegiate affiliations – the Yale Club and Penn Club of New York City are typical of university clubs: they are open to all who have a connection with their respective universities (in this case Yale University or the University of Pennsylvania) – some clubs have highly specific membership requirements.

The Caledonian Club in London requires &quot;being of direct Scottish descent, that is to say, tracing descent from a Scottish father or mother, grandfather or grandmother&quot; or &quot;having, in the opinion of the Committee, the closest association with Scotland.&quot;

The Travellers Club, from its foundation in 1819, has excluded from membership anyone who has not met a very specific travelling requirement. Rule 6 of the club&#x27;s constitution states that &quot;no person be considered eligible to the Travellers&#x27; Club, who shall not have travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least 500 miles from London in a direct line&quot;.

The Reform Club requires its potential members to attest that they would have supported the 1832 Reform Act, whilst certain members of the East India Club must have attended one of its affiliated public schools.

Clubs also require membership fees, which, along with the ongoing cost of meeting their dress codes and the cost of bar tabs and dining bills, tends to impose a financial barrier for existing and would-be members. Most clubs have favourable subscription fees for younger members.

<text>A smart shop (or smartshop) is a retail establishment that specializes in the sale of psychoactive substances, usually including psychedelics, as well as related literature and paraphernalia. The name derives from the name &quot;smart drugs&quot;, a class of drugs and food supplements intended to enhance cognitive abilities which are often sold in smart shops.

==The rise of anonymous smart shops==
Some governments do not tolerate smart shops in any form as a part of their crime prevention. For example, the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden with its zero tolerance drug policy, does not accept physical smart shops and has shut down every known Swedish online smart shop that have been selling pure research chemicals on the visible Web. To circumvent this the usage of anonymous marketplaces through the Tor network has taken over since the establishment of Silk Road, which in contrast took the FBI two and a half years to take down for one month.

==Typical products specialization==
===Smart drugs===
Smart shops (often webshops) offer prescription-free pharmacy products such as Ritalin, Adderall, and modafinil, for example.

===Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants===

====Traditional entheogens====
Smart shops are best known in practice for selling whatever psychedelics, dissociatives, entactogens and deliriants local law permits. In the Netherlands, which is home to most of the smart shops in Europe, this includes &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, Peyote, San Pedro cactus, &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot;, and various ingredients for Ayahuasca preparations. 
As of 1 December 2008, magic mushrooms are under stricter control in the Netherlands. Those new controls are quite controversial, because the list of banned mushrooms also contains species that have no psychoactive substances. Magic Mushroom spore prints and grow boxes are still available over the counter in the Netherlands. Psilocybin is not included in the ban and continues to be sold in smart shops nationwide in truffle form.

====Decline of designer drugs====

Smart shops in various countries have been known in the past to sell designer drugs: that is, synthetic substances that were not (yet) illegal. The sale of synthetic drugs not explicitly approved as food, supplements or medicines is illegal in some of them. For example, in the Netherlands it is dealt with by the relatively benign machinery of the &quot;Warenautoriteit&quot; (Commodities Authority) rather than in criminal law, as would be the case with controlled substances.

Yet, this has made it effectively impossible to sell them in a formal retail setting, even if their production and possession is entirely legitimate. Smart shops have attempted no further marketing of synthetics since they tried to sell methylone as a &quot;room odorizer&quot; but were ultimately forced to pull it from their shelves in 2004, though it can still be obtained under the counter in some shops.

===Drug paraphernalia===
Smart shops sell many products that can be seen as complement goods to psychoactive drugs, including illegal ones. In the Netherlands, which has no drug paraphernalia laws, this is entirely legal. In particular, the sales of literature about illegal drugs or their manufacture is rarely criticized and protected by a traditional concern for free speech in local law and custom that is more pronounced than in other European nations.

Many of the paraphernalia and complements sold in smart shops reduce, in one way or another, the harm associated with illegal drugs. For instance, reagent kits for testing the purity of ecstasy can be essential now that tablets named ecstasy can in practice contain just about anything, and often do not, in fact, contain MDMA at all. Supplements of vitamins and amino acids have been developed to mitigate specifically the damage of certain illegal drugs. Tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, for instance, can be used to help the body replenish serotonin levels in the brain after the use of MDMA, and vitamin supplements are appropriate for users of stimulants such as amphetamine. Vitamin B12 is depleted by recreational use of nitrous oxide, and is thereby useful.

Smart shop is distinguished from head shops found in many countries. Head shops provide only paraphernalia, whereas smart shops usually sell at least some actual drugs. The term head shop is more common in the UK, though many British head shops sold magic mushrooms until July 2005 when the Government introduced a complete ban on magic mushrooms, putting them in the same category as heroin and crack cocaine. Many of the British head shops still sell a range of other legal highs.

==Education and information==
Smart shops have become a natural source of information about the drugs they sell. They commonly provide instruction leaflets similar to the package inserts distributed with prescription drugs, which contain information on contra-indications, side effects, and the importance of set and setting. In the Netherlands, there is relatively little formal regulation of the smart shop industry, but the natural concentration of expertise about a relatively exotic range of products in combination with the realization that closer public scrutiny and regulation are always lurking in the background have caused the smart shops to organize into an industry association that, among other things, promotes the spread of information about its wares.

==Legality==

===The Netherlands===
Legally, smart shops operate under a decision of the Hoge Raad (Supreme Court) that has declared that unprepared mushrooms and cacti are not considered &quot;preparations&quot; of the substances they contain, and are therefore not banned under the Opium Act or international law even if their active ingredients are.

There are some shops from the Netherlands that operate as both a smart shop and a head shop on an international level. Customers are expected to accept the responsibility to inform themselves about the local laws, import and custom regulations before ordering and to certify that the import to their country of the products ordered is legal.

As of December 1, 2008, the sale of magic mushrooms was subject to tighter control in the Netherlands.

This legal regime is markedly different from the one that applies to cannabis products. Those are formally illegal under the Opium Act and international law, which explicitly bans the plant rather than the cannabinoids in it. Cannabis products such as marijuana and hashish can be sold and possessed only pursuant to a web of executive orders more-or-less silently assented to by parliament. The sale of magic mushrooms, on the other hand, was entirely legal and subject only to the common regulation of foodstuffs by the &quot;Warenautoriteit&quot; (Commodities Authority).

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, there was a sharp rise in Smart shops around the Celtic Tiger era, however, given new government legislations against psychoactive substances, Smart shops that do still operate in the Republic Of Ireland have become shops for paraphernalia and growing equipment, more comparable to a Head Shop.

===UK===
As with UK based head shops, both paraphernalia and &quot;legal highs&quot; are available from these stores, such as Salvia Divinorum-based products designed to simulate illegal drug highs such as those experienced through the use of amphetamine [speed], methamphetamine, and psychedelics [psilocybin]. Magic mushrooms were available until the government closed a loophole, effectively banning the sale of raw or prepared magic mushrooms in January 2006.

Since the passing of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, the sale of any chemical substance which alters or affects mental functioning in any way is illegal. This has effectively rendered the term &quot;smartshop&quot; obsolete in the UK.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, prior to March 2013, the drug laws were very liberal, and several smartshops were opened. A chain store, called Magic Mushroom, emerged as the market leader. Shops in Portugal still sell all type of herbal incense and plant feeders. In March 2013, the Portuguese Government enacted a law making it illegal to sell psychoactive drugs, thus ending the smartshop business in the country.

<doc id="1140878" wikidata="Q935349" url="?curid=1140878" title="Shamo chickens">
<text>is an overall designation for gamefowl in Japan. There are seven recognised breeds of Shamo chicken in Japan, all of which are designated Natural Monuments of Japan. The Shamo breeds are thought to derive from fighting chickens of Malay type brought from Thailand in the early part of the seventeenth century.

== History ==

The Shamo breeds are thought to derive from fighting chickens of Malay type brought from Thailand in the early part of the seventeenth century or early Edo period (1603–1867). The Japanese word &quot;Shamo&quot; derives from &quot;Siam&quot;, the former name of Thailand. The birds have been selectively bred for several hundred years for their fighting ability. Some were imported to Western countries in the 1970s; in the twenty-first century, the birds are reported from four countries outside Japan: Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

== Breeds ==

The seven recognised Shamo breeds designated as Natural Monuments of Japan are:

* Ehigo-Nankin-Shamo, a slightly taller and more slender variant of the Nankin-Shamo from Niigata
* O-Shamo (&quot;large Shamo&quot;, )
* Kinpa
* Ko-Shamo (&quot;small Shamo&quot;, )
* Nankin-Shamo (Nankin Shamo, )
* Yakido or Ygido ()
* Yamato-Shamo or Yamato Gunkei

Other Shamo variants are the Chu-Shamo (&quot;medium Shamo&quot;, ) and the Chibi Shamo, the bantam of the Yamato Gunkei.

== In the West ==

In Western countries, the breed name &quot;Shamo&quot; includes both the O-Shamo and the Chu-Shamo. In the United Kingdom, different weight ranges are given in the &quot;British Poultry Standards&quot; for the two types within the Shamo breed; the Ko-Shamo, Nankin Shamo, Yakido and Yamato Gunkei are recognised as distinct breeds. The Entente Européenne recognises the Shamo, Ko-Shamo, Yakido and Yamato Gunkei, and lists the Chu-Shamo and Nankin Shamo as unrecognised. The &quot;Australian Poultry Standards&quot; list only one form of Shamo, which has a minimum weight of . The American Poultry Association recognises the Shamo as a breed, both full-sized and bantam.

<text>James John &quot;Jimmy&quot; Tompkins (7 September 1870 – 5 May 1953) was a Roman Catholic priest who founded the Antigonish Movement, a progressive effort that incorporated adult education, cooperatives and rural community development to aid the fishing and mining communities of northern and eastern Nova Scotia, Canada. The Antigonish Movement later evolved into the Extension Department (now the Coady International Center) of St. Francis Xavier University. 

Father Tompkins believed in the emancipating power of education and sought to improve economic conditions through study groups and co-operative action. &quot;It is not enough to have ideas, we have to put legs on them&quot;, he often said. He started the first regional library in Nova Scotia along with the first credit union and a cooperative housing association in Reserve Mines that was dubbed &quot;Tompkinsville&quot;. Father Tompkins was the Spiritual founder of the Antigonish Movement.

==Brief biography==
Jimmy Tompkins was born in Margaree Forks, Nova Scotia, a small farming community on Cape Breton Island. From 1888-1895, he attended St. Francis Xavier University in alternate semesters while teaching Greek and Mathematics to support himself. He attended the Urban College of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (Papal Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith) in Rome from 1897 to 1902. On his return, he continued teaching at St. Francis Xavier University and became the vice-rector in 1907.

Working closely with the Carnegie Corporation, he implemented various reform and modernization programs, culminating in an unsuccessful attempt to amalgamate various sectarian and non-sectarian colleges in the Maritime Provinces into one nondenominational university centered around Dalhousie University in Halifax. Although the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Halifax Edward McCarthy supported amalgamation, the Catholic Bishop of Antigonish James Morrison successfully opposed it and eventually exiled Tompkins to the tiny fishing village of Canso, Nova Scotia as parish priest for Canso, Little Dover and Queensport.

As parish priest Tompkins observed firsthand the plight of the poor fishing community there and helped organize and lead what would become the Antigonish Movement of cooperative fisheries, stores, housing projects, and adult study groups. The Antigonish Movement was eventually institutionalized in the form of the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier, which was headed by Tompkins&#x27; double-cousin Father Moses Coady and which included Father Hugh MacPherson, A.B. MacDonald and others.

<doc id="1140897" wikidata="Q2232083" url="?curid=1140897" title="Foam party">
<text>A foam party is a social event at which participants dance to music on a dance floor covered in several feet of suds or bubbles, dispensed from a foam machine. In the past, foam parties have been associated with nightclubs, large events, and college parties. 

Today, mobile foam party services and foam machine rental companies are available to bring foam party equipment to residential properties and backyards for birthday parties, graduation parties, and family reunions. Mobile foam parties are also a popular form of enrichment and physical activity for children at schools, daycare centers, and summer camps. 

==History==

Foam parties can be dated back to &quot;A Rhapsody in Black and Blue&quot;, a 1932 short film directed by Aubrey Scotto, wherein Louis Armstrong dances, sings, and plays his trumpet in a large area of soap suds. Songs performed in the foam are &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Glad When You&#x27;re Dead, You Rascal You&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot;. Another film featuring foam parties is &quot;The Party&quot;, featuring Peter Sellers.

Modern foam parties were developed in the early 1990s by club promoters in Ibiza. Generally, machines were large, ceiling-mounted foam generators, created by Weird Dream Productions, that created a large volume of foam that fell from the ceiling onto clubbers. The large water usage and subsequent cleanup required made this impractical for many venues., resulting in a demand upon Weird Dream Productions to modify their foam to be of low water content. Weird Dreams achieved this in model Mk III which produced 200,000 litres per minute with just 50l of water. UK style leaders Big Fun and Roy Barlow Leisure purchased machines from Weird Dream Productions and later began manufacturing their own versions, creating a global market for the product, and these three companies remained global market leaders throughout the craze. All market leaders were UK-based until around 2004. In recent years, there has been a large growth in at-home parties, and even more grand foam experiences. In the kids birthday and party market, there are many companies offering parties for front or back yards, using the water and electricity of the homeowner. Sometimes one can rent inflatables to contain the foam. While they can contain the foam, these can take up a lot of space. In warmer climates, kids often wear bathing suits. Today, there are a few companies that make foam cannons from industrial fans and pipes.

As Ibiza foam parties became more popular, the craze spread, and the foam cannon was developed by Roy Barlow from The Entertainment Biz and Robin Wincup from Galaxy. 

In the 1990s, foam parties were performed weekly at Amnesia in Ibiza.

==Safety==
There are numerous hazards associated with foam parties. Common hazards include slipping on floors made slick by the foam, with risks being intensified when combined with alcohol. 

In 2008, three people were electrocuted and two others injured at a foam party at the Venezia Palace Hotel in Antalya, Turkey.

Today, the foam used by most mobile foam party companies for birthday parties and other outdoor events is generated by mixing a powdered or gel foam concentrate with water and pumping it through a foam machine or cannon. These products are bio-degradable, allergy-free, and safe for children, pets, and residential lawns when used as directed.

<text>Justin Francis Rigali (born April 19, 1935) is an American cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was the eighth Archbishop of Philadelphia, having previously served as Archbishop of St. Louis from 1994 to 2003, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003. Following a sex abuse probe into the Catholic Church, Cardinal Rigali resigned in 2011.

Rigali previously served as the Committee for Pro-Life Activities chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
The youngest of seven children, Justin Rigali was born on April 19, 1935, in Los Angeles, California, to Henry Alphonsus and Frances Irene (née White) Rigali. His sister Charlotte joined the Sisters of St. Joseph and his brother Norbert the Society of Jesus. Rigali attended Holy Cross School before entering the preparatory seminary in Hancock Park, Los Angeles, in 1949.

Rigali studied at one of the Los Angeles College campuses, at Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary in San Fernando, California, and at St. John&#x27;s Seminary in Camarillo, California.

=== Priesthood ===
Rigali was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles by Cardinal James Francis McIntyre on April 25, 1961. After his ordination, Rigali received pastoral assignments at parishes in Los Angeles and Downey, California.

In 1961, Rigali earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In October 1961, he entered the graduate division of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, obtaining a Doctor of Canon Law degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1964.

While in Rome, Rigali served as an assistant during the first two sessions (1962–1963) of the Second Vatican Council. Rigali returned to California in the summer of 1964 and was briefly assigned as an associate pastor at a parish in Pomona. Back to Rome, he studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1964 to 1966 in preparation for his diplomatic work for the Vatican.

=== Vatican Secretariat ===
Rigali began his service in the English section of the Secretariat of State on November 25, 1964. From September 1966 to February 1970, he served as secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature to Madagascar. The Vatican named Rigali as a papal chamberlain on July 11, 1967. On February 11, 1970, Rigali became director of the English section of the Secretariat of State. He also served as the English translator for Pope Paul VI, accompanying him on several international trips.

During his service at the Secretariat of State, Rigali also served as a chaplain at a Carmelite monastery and as a professor at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He accompanied Pope John Paul II on several international trips, including his 1979 and 1987 visits to the United States. The Vatican elevated Rigali to a prelate of honor on April 19, 1980, and to a magistral chaplain in the Order of the Knights of Malta on October 25, 1984.
=== Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy ===
On June 8, 1985, Rigali was appointed president of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and titular archbishop of Volsinium by John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on September 14, 1985, from John Paul II, with Cardinals Eduardo Somalo and Achille Silvestrini as co-consecrators, at Albano Cathedral in Lazio, Italy. Rigali selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Verbum Caro Factum Est&quot;, meaning, &quot;The Word Became Flesh&quot; (). He was named a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre on October 13, 1986.

From 1985 to 1990, Rigali also held several positions within the Roman Curia:

* Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops, appointed by John Paul II on December 21, 1989; he was the second-highest official of that dicastery. 
* Secretary of the College of Cardinals, named by John Paul II on January 2, 1990
* Member of the Permanent Interdicasterial Commission
* Member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America 
* Member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
* Member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity
* Member of the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church

During the same time, Rigali also provided pastoral service to parishes and seminaries in Rome.

===Archbishop of St. Louis===
On January 25, 1994, John Paul II named Rigali as the seventh archbishop of St. Louis. Rigali was installed in St. Louis, Missouri, by Cardinal Bernardin Gantin on March 15, 1994.

Rigali became a member of the Knights of Columbus on November 7, 1994. During his tenure at St. Louis, Rigali showed a great interest in schools, visiting every Catholic high school in the archdiocese. However, Rigali opposed collective bargaining by teachers, and opposed any efforts they made to unionize. Rigali was widely credited as an able administrator and effective fundraiser, although observers said that his popularity dimmed as his tenure continued.

In January 1999, Rigali hosted the visit of John Paul II to St. Louis. The pope reportedly decided to visit the archdiocese because of his longtime close friendship with Rigali in Rome.

According to the &quot;St. Louis Business Journal&quot;, Rigali &quot;brought financial stability to the St. Louis Archdiocese, overseeing successful capital campaigns to address immediate needs and raising endowment funds for the future.&quot;

===Archbishop of Philadelphia===
Rigali was appointed the eighth archbishop of Philadelphia by John Paul II on July 15, 2003. He was installed as archbishop on October 7, 2003. On September 28, 2003, the Vatican elevated Rigali to the College of Cardinals, a customary privilege for the archbishops of Philadelphia. Rigali was created as cardinal-priest of &quot;Santa Prisca&quot; in Rome during the consistory of October 21, 2003.

Rigali was the only American cardinal to serve as a concelebrant at the 2005 funeral Mass for John Paul II. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI.

In September 2007, Rigali was named by Pope Benedict XVI as a member of the Congregation for Bishops. On August 31, 2009, Benedict XVI appointed Rigali as the apostolic administrator to the Diocese of Scranton, following the resignations of Bishop Joseph Martino and Auxiliary Bishop John Dougherty. Rigali served eight months as the apostolic administrator.

On June 16, 2011, Benedict XVI appointed Rigali to serve as his special envoy to the celebrations at Prachatice in the Czech Republic for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Bishop John Neumann.

=== Retirement ===
On July 19, 2011, Benedict XVI accepted Rigali&#x27;s resignation as archbishop of Philadelphia and named Archbishop Charles J. Chaput to succeed him. Chaput was installed as archbishop on September 8, 2011. Rigali then retired in residence at the Diocese of Knoxville. He was invited there by Bishop Richard Stika, with whom he shares living quarters.

Rigali participated in the 2013 conclave that selected Pope Francis. Rigali remained eligible to vote in conclaves until he reached 80 on April 19, 2015. In December 2013, Rigali retired from the Congregation for Bishops. During this period, Rigali participated in some activities in the Diocese of Nashville. In January 2023, Rigali was hospitalized in Knoxville, Tennessee, for a few days for an undisclosed medical condition.

===Sexual abuse scandals===
In October 2005, a grand jury empaneled in 2003 by Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham released a report on the cover-ups of sexual abuse by clergy in the archdiocese. In response to the report, Rigali stated that “no priests in ministry today who have an admitted or established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor against them.” However, some groups disputed the accuracy of that statement.

In 2007, a former Catholic high school student reported that he had been repeatedly molested by Bishop Michael J. Bransfield of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. The alleged abuse took place when Bransfield was priest teaching Lansdale Catholic High School in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, during the 1970s. Rigali, then archbishop of Philadelphia, announced in October 2009 that the allegations could not be substantiated and took no action against Bransfield.

In 2011, Bransfield gave $1,000 to Rigali. Bransfield made other cash gifts to senior clerics in the archdiocese, including Monsignor Timothy C. Senior, the vicar for clergy. One of Bransfield&#x27;s accusers said that Rigali and other archdiocesan officials &quot;looked the other way&quot; and failed to inform him about the church&#x27;s handling of his complaint.

In early 2011, another grand jury in Philadelphia reported that the archdiocese was still negligent in its handling of sexual abuse accusations against clergy. In March 2011, Rigali suspended 21 priests in a single day, &quot;prompting criticism that he should have alerted prosecutors sooner.&quot;

==Views==

===Same sex marriage===
In June 2006, Rigali traveled to the White House along with Archbishop John J. Myers and Cardinal Seán Patrick O&#x27;Malley to attend a press conference by US President George W. Bush. The purpose was to support passage of the proposed Marriage Protection Amendment to the US Constitution in the United States Senate, which would ban civil unions and marriages by same sex couples. The amendment did not pass the senate in 2006 or in later years.

===Abortion===
As chair of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Pro-Life Committee, he remarked during the annual Washington, DC, Pro life rally in January 2007 that there were &quot;reasons for rejoicing&quot; in the pro-life cause because more and more young people were working for the cause, and that there was a &quot;growing moral sensitivity among them.&quot; In 2009, Rigali endorsed passage of the Pregnant Women Support Act in Congress. He praised the bill for offering &quot;an authentic common ground&quot; that will provide many kinds of life-affirming support for pregnant women and their unborn children. The bill did not pass congress.

===Conscience rights===
In November 2009, Rigali, along with other Catholic prelates and religious leaders from other denominations, signed the &quot;Manhattan Declaration.&quot; The document reiterated conservative viewpoints on marriage and religious freedom &quot;.&quot;

===Stem cell research===
In March 2009, Rigali described President Barack Obama&#x27;s lifting of George W. Bush&#x27;s restrictions on embryonic stem cell research as &quot;a sad victory of politics over science and ethics.&quot;

===Ordination of women===
In April 2009, Rigali denounced the ordination ceremony of two Catholic women in Philadelphia, calling it a &quot;pseudo-ordination&quot; that &quot;denigrates the truth entrusted to the Church by Christ himself.&quot; He excommunicated the two participants

===Communications===
Rigali has run a weekly series of Lenten discourses on YouTube. In 2010, he established an official Facebook page.

==Charity work==
Rigali is an honorary council member of the St. Louis, Missouri–based humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.

<text>Thomas Moles (13 November 1871 – 3 February 1937) was a journalist and Ulster Unionist politician.

==Life==
Born in Belfast in 1871, Moles was the son of Edward Moles and Margaret née Carson and was educated at the Collegiate School, Ballymena. A journalist by profession, he was Leader Writer for the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; from 1909 until 1924 and managing editor for that newspaper from 1924.

Moles was an Irish representative on the British press visit to Canada in 1911. He was a member of the Secretariat to the Irish Convention from 1917 to 1918.

Moles was MP for Belfast Ormeau 1918–1922 and Belfast South at Westminster from 1922 until he retired in 1929.

He was also an MP in the Northern Ireland House of Commons from 1921 to 1929 for South Belfast and for Belfast, Ballynafeigh from 1929 to his death in 1937. He was the first ever member declared elected to the Northern Ireland House of Commons. He was Chairman of the Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons from 7 June 1921 until his death; and Member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland in 1923.

Moles was married in Ramoan, Co Antrim on 20 March 1901 to Charlotte Brannigan and had three children. He was also a motorcycle enthusiast and helped to push through parliament the first Road Races Act, which made it legal for the roads on the Clady Course to be closed for the first Ulster Grand Prix motorcycle road race on 14 October 1922.

<text>Santos Ltd. (South Australia and Northern Territory Oil Search) is an Australian oil and gas exploration and production company, with its headquarters in Adelaide, South Australia. It owns liquefied natural gas (LNG), pipeline gas, and oil assets. It is the biggest supplier of natural gas in Australia, with its plants in the Cooper Basin in South Australia and South West Queensland supplying the eastern states of Australia. Its operations also extend to the seas off Western Australia and Northern Territory.

The company has been criticised by environmentalists and others for its high level of greenhouse gas emissions, its lobbying of political parties, and various incidents causing contamination. Santos provides sponsorship of several arts festivals and bodies, charities, and the University of Adelaide&#x27;s Australian School of Petroleum.

==History==
Santos was incorporated on 18 March 1954, with its name an acronym of South Australia Northern Territory Oil Search. Its core business was initially built on gas discoveries in the Cooper Basin, South Australia, with the discovery and development of the Gidgealpa 2 well in 1963 and Moomba 1 in 1966. It signed supply contracts with the South Australian Gas Company, the Electricity Trust of South Australia and the Australian Gas Light Company, commencing supply in 1969.

After oil was discovered at Tirrawarra, near Moomba, South Australia, in the early 1970s, the company developed its liquid supply operations, which included a plant at Moomba and a fractionation and loading facility at Port Bonython.

In the 1990s, the company expanded, acquiring other companies and developing its operations both onshore and offshore in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea. Also in this decade it acquired interests in petroleum in the United States and United Kingdom, as well as operations in the Timor Sea and Western Australia. The Ballera gas plant in South West Queensland was established in 1991 and upgraded in 1997.

In 2015 Santos began producing LNG, shipping it to South Korea.
In August 2018 Santos announced the acquisition of Australian oil and gas company Quadrant Energy for $2.15 billion. As part of the deal, Santos obtained Quadrant&#x27;s 80% stake in Dorado in the Bedout Basin in northern Western Australia.

In May 2020 Santos completed its acquisition of ConocoPhillips&#x27; northern Australia and Timor-Leste assets for US$1.265 billion as well as a contingent payment of US$200 million, which gave Santos control of ageing offshore assets in Bayu-Undan, subsea assets in the Timor Sea, and onshore gas plant Darwin LNG (DLNG), which included the Bayu-Undan to Darwin Pipeline. At the completion of the deal with ConocoPhillips, the interest of Santos in these assets was increased to 68.4%, The sale was contingent on a final investment decision on the future #Barossa project, which once concluded increased Santos&#x27; interest in the project to 62.5%.

In December 2021, Santos bought Oil Search, the largest oil and gas exploration and development company incorporated in Papua New Guinea, which operated all of the country&#x27;s oilfields.

==Description and governance==
Santos is one of Australia&#x27;s domestic gas and oil producers, supplying sales gas to all mainland Australian states and territories, ethane to Sydney, and oil and liquids to domestic and international customers. It is the biggest supplier of natural gas in Australia, Australia&#x27;s second-largest independent producer of oil and natural gas, and was slated to become the world&#x27;s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter by 2019. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Santos was ranked as the 1583rd-largest public company in the world.

Santos has its headquarters at 60 Flinders Street, Adelaide. It also has offices in Brisbane, Sydney, Perth and Jakarta.

Since 1 February 2016 and the company&#x27;s CEO has been Kevin Gallagher. He was preceded by David Knox.

==Operations==
The South Australian and Queensland gas reserves are the main sources of natural gas to the eastern states of Australia. Santos is the primary venture partner and operator of natural gas processing facilities at Moomba in SA and Ballera in Queensland, and pipelines connecting those facilities with Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Rockhampton and Mount Isa.

===Gas and LNG===

Santos has made significant discoveries in the Browse Basin, off the northwest of Western Australia. On 22 August 2014 the company announced a major gas condensate discovery at the Lasseter-1 exploration well in WA-274-P in the basin, in which Santos had a 30% interest in company with Chevron (50%) and Inpex (20%). It was the second major discovery by the company in the area in two years.

On 7 September 2017 Santos pledged to divert 30 petajoules of gas from the Gladstone LNG plant slated for export into Australia&#x27;s east coast market in 2018 and 2019, as part of efforts to avert government-imposed restrictions on gas exports to solve local gas shortages. Because of shortages in its own supply of gas for export, Santos rely on purchasing gas from third parties to supply its overseas contracts.

Santos has an interest in the Darwin LNG project, which was the first liquefied natural gas project in the Northern Territory and the second in Australia. It has been supplied by the Bayu-Undan field, which is anticipated will be exhausted during the 2020s, hence the intention to develop the Barossa project to replace the dwindling reserves.

====Barossa project====

The Barossa project is a proposed gas field in the Timor Sea, intended to take over from Bayu-Undan field after its reserves are exhausted, supplying LNG to the Darwin facility via a new pipeline which, for part of its length, run parallel to the existing Bayu-Undan to Darwin Pipeline. Condensate oil will also be extracted. It is situated around north of Darwin, in Australian waters. Worth , the project was signed off in 2021, with gas production is expected to commence in 2025. The project is expected to create about 600 jobs during construction and 350 ongoing jobs in Darwin over the following 20 years.

The project has been criticised for its future carbon emissions. If developed, Barossa would become the most carbon-intensive gas development in Australia. When the project was purchased from ConocoPhillips in 2020, it was projected to produce 1.5 tonnes of for every tonne of LNG. A 2021 report using the Darwin LNG project as a case study suggested that emissions could be greatly reduced by the use of solar power by using Sun Cable&#x27;s Australia-Asia Power Link. but the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) described the project as an “emissions factory with a gas by-product”, saying that even if it employed carbon capture and storage, the project would continue to release financially risky carbon dioxide emissions at the site, onshore and across the whole supply chain.

The project has been the target of a number of high profile legal cases. In March 2022 leaders of the Jikilaruwu Tiwi Islands clan targeted the South Korean state-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation, which are planning to lend Santos approximately (£530m). The case failed in the Seoul District Court. In June 2022 traditional owners of the Tiwi Islands filed a lawsuit against Santos and the federal government, who they said had not properly consulted them. In the lawsuit Dennis Tipakalippa (senior lawman of the Munipi Clan) also argued that NOPSEMA, the federal offshore gas regulator, should not have approved Santos’ plans to drill the Barossa gas field due to the Santos&#x27; inadequate consultation.
The traditional owners are concerned about the effect on the nesting areas of flatback and olive ridley turtles, which provide one of the Aboriginal people&#x27;s traditional food sources. Four federal government marine parks, including Ashmore Reef, are also in the vicinity. Santos has submitted an environmental impact plan, which includes the potential impact of an oil spill, and its plans for cleanup should one occur. In September 2022 Judge Mordecai Bromberg dismissed Santos’ environmental plan, thus invalidating its authorisation for drilling. As a result Santos had to disconnect its drilling rig from the sea north of Melville Island and leave the Barossa field by 6 October 2022.
==Financial results==
Santos&#x27; production for 2008 was of oil equivalent. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisations and exploration expenses for the period was A$2.8 billion, representing after tax profit of A$1.65 billion. On 22 August 2014 the company said its oil production was at its highest level in six years. For the first half of 2014, Santos recorded sales revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 20% on the comparable period the previous year. Sales volumes rose by 5% to 28.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of the company writing off its investment in a coal seam gas project in Indonesia, the 2014 first-half profit being down 24% at $206 million.

In 2015, Santos&#x27; financial troubles became more evident as the share price crashed to one third of its value from the previous year. It hit a 12-year low and has stayed low since. This occurred because of mounting debt and an oil price slump. CEO David Knox was forced to leave, with chairman Peter Coates stepping into the role and leading a strategic review of the gas company. Options of partial asset sale, even takeovers, has been speculated including &quot;No options will be ruled out from consideration, but neither is any particular option a preferred course at this time,&quot; Coates said.

==Issues==
=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===

In 2020, Santos was named on a list of Australia&#x27;s 65 worst greenhouse gas emitting companies. Following additional pressure from ethical investors, Santos announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 using a combination of carbon capture and storage, renewable energy and offsetting through tree planting programs.

=== Lobbying and political donations ===
Santos has engaged Adelaide-based consultancy Bespoke Approach to lobby the Australian Government and the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland. Other lobbyists which have represented Santos include: Kreab Gavin Anderson (Australia) Ltd, Craig Emerson Economics and Australian Public Affairs.

In the financial year 2012–13, Santos Ltd gave donations directly to the Labor, Liberal, and National political parties at state and federal levels. Donations are tabled below.
== Incidents ==
=== Moomba explosions, South Australia ===

On 1 January 2004 an explosion occurred at Santos&#x27; Moomba processing facility. The blast was traced to the Liquids Recovery Plant (LRP), where an inlet manifold and a related flange weld both failed after corrosion by mercury. Mercury was released along with a cloud of flammable gases including methane, ethane, propane and butane. Workers saw the cloud and raised the alarm, shutting down the plant and evacuating to designated safety points. Some workers allegedly did not hear the emergency alarms. The gas cloud ignited on contact with a heating unit 150 metres away, and an explosion followed. The plant was seriously damaged.

Moomba workers who sought to remain anonymous told &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper on 5 January that the company was running a &quot;cowboy&quot; operation, and that it was luck, not management that had prevented any loss of life. They also said that the emergency muster area was too close to the plant in the event of a major tank explosion.

Gas supplies to South Australia and New South Wales were interrupted, leading to down-time in the manufacturing sector and short-term rationing measures in both states while repairs were made. Santos spent $40 million on remedial action following the incident. In 2011, the South Australian industrial relations court ruled that 13 employees had been placed at risk due to critical safety shortcomings. These included an inadequate risk assessment which failed to identify the likelihood of plant failing due to liquid metal rendering it brittle. The company pleaded guilty to breaching the &quot;Occupational Health Safety and Welfare Act&quot; after a SafeWork prosecution and was fined $84,000.

=== Sidoarjo mud flow, Indonesia ===
In May 2006, the Sidoarjo mud flow disaster occurred in East Java, Indonesia. Controversy exists surrounding the probable cause of the disaster which has displaced approximately 10,000 people and covered villages, farms and industrial areas with mud. The eruption is ongoing, though since 2011 the rate of flow has reduced.

Santos had stated in June 2006 that it maintained &quot;appropriate insurance coverage for these types of occurrences&quot;.

=== Port Bonython groundwater contamination, South Australia ===

In May 2008, groundwater contamination was reported to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) following detection at Santos&#x27; Port Bonython site, Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Hydrocarbons were found floating on and in the groundwater. One hundred and fifty inspection wells were later established, and a cement bentonite wall was constructed &#x27;to stop the further spread of contamination off-site&#x27; including to the marine environment. In May 2012, Santos reported declining rates of hydrocarbon recovery from groundwater extraction wells and claimed that their remediation efforts were working.

=== Pilliga CSG wastewater spill, New South Wales ===
In 2011, a 10,000-litre spill of untreated coal seam gas water occurred impacting native vegetation and soil in the Pilliga forest. Coal seam gas extraction produces water that can contain lead, mercury, various salts and other heavy metals. Rehabilitation has been trying to restore this site to remediate elevated contamination in the soil.

=== Jackson oil spill, Queensland ===
In May 2013, an uncontrolled oil spill was reported in Santos&#x27; Zeus field near Jackson in Queensland&#x27;s remote south-west. The flow lasted &#x27;almost a week&#x27; before international experts were able to contain it. The rate of flow was estimated at 50,000 litres per day.

=== Uranium contamination of Narrabri aquifers, New South Wales ===
In 2013, groundwater monitoring detected elevated levels of salinity and heavy metals near Santos&#x27; Tintsfield ponds in the Pilliga forest. Also it was reported that at the Bibblewindi ponds, uranium 20 times above the safe drinking levels was detected. A NSW Government investigation into the incident determined the leak was &quot;small, localised and contained&quot; and drinking water sources and stock and domestic water sources were not impacted nor were they at risk. The Investigation also found that the uranium detected was not from the pond&#x27;s water, but was from naturally occurring Uranium in the surrounding soil that was mobilised from the leaking pond.

===Climate activism===
In March 2021, four Extinction Rebellion protesters glued themselves to the road outside the Santos building in Adelaide, and two scaled the building, painted messages on it, set off flares and glued themselves to the building. Police and firefighters had to remove them and the protesters, who included three women aged over 64, were charged. They were protesting against fracking, and called upon Santos to invest more in renewable energy.

Tiwi Islanders won a landmark case in September 2022, against drilling for gas by Santos in their traditional waters after complaining that the company failed to consult them about the impact of the project. Judge Mordecai Bromberg set aside approval for the drilling, part of Santos’s $4.7bn Barossa project and gave Santos two weeks to shut down and remove its rig from the sea north of Melville Island. The Judge said the offshore oil and gas regulator Nopsema failed to assess whether Santos had consulted with everyone affected by the proposed drilling, as required by the law.

In 2024 Santos was granted permission to resume laying an underwater pipeline for the Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea, north of Darwin, after winning a legal battle against a group of Tiwi Islands elders. The case founded on the traditional accounts of the Ampiji and the Crocodile Man was characterised by a significant degree of divergence among relevant Tiwi Islanders about the content of those Dreaming or songlines. Justice Charlesworth also said she was not satisfied by claims the pipeline might damage potential cultural heritage sites along the sea floor.

The evidence established nothing more than a negligible chance that there may be objects of archaeological value in the area of the pipeline route.

=== Pipeline explosions ===
In January 2023, a gas pipeline exploded due to material fatigue. A similar event occurred in 2020. Both events were reported to the Government of South Australia, but neither was made public until they were discussed at the company&#x27;s 2023 AGM and subsequently reported on by ABC news.

==Sponsorship==

Santos sponsors many community activities, events, institutions and projects in jurisdictions where they operate commercially. In October 2014, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; claimed that Santos spends $10 million annually on South Australian community groups, events and institutions. Figures published in Santos&#x27; 2014 Sustainability Report state that $7,487,731 was spent on &#x27;Community investment&#x27; in South Australia that financial year and $3,108,057 in Queensland. Other jurisdictions received between $5,000 (South Korea) and $775,255 (Western Australia) and the total &#x27;community investment&#x27; spent across all regions during 2013–14 was $13,217,617.

* Santos GLNG Food &amp; Fire Fest
* Queensland Police Service&#x27;s &quot;Stay on Track Outback&quot; road safety campaign (2012–2014)

=== ANU divestment ===
In October 2014, the Australian National University (ANU) sold its shares in Santos and several other companies in the nation&#x27;s most reported case of fossil fuel industry divestment. Santos responded by claiming that gas is necessary in the state&#x27;s future energy mix, and &quot;The Advertiser&quot; published its economic value to South Australia. It was reported that Santos employed 3500 people nationally as well as thousands of contractors, and had a $13 billion market value. Politicians expressing their support for the company included the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and federal MPs Jamie Briggs, Christopher Pyne, James McGrath, Greg Hunt and Treasurer Joe Hockey. Several senior state ministers also spoke out against the decision to divest in South Australia and Queensland, including South Australian Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis. Former Liberal party leaders John Hewson and Malcolm Fraser both supported ANU&#x27;s right to choose how and where to invest its money. ANU chancellor Gareth Evans said that the university had not described Santos as a &quot;socially irresponsible&quot; company, and in a letter to Santos CEO David Knox, Evans said the university regretted any embarrassment suffered by Santos over the decision to divest.

=== Opposition to Santos sponsorship ===
In December 2014, photographs showing Queensland police vehicles featuring Santos company logos was criticised by anti-coal seam gas group Lock the Gate Alliance. Santos contributed approximately $40,000 to the road safety program &quot;stay on track outback&quot; which was described as valuable addition to a road safety campaign. Queensland Police commissioner Ian Stewart described the vehicles as &quot;PR vehicles that we use at shows, we use at expos, all of those sorts of things just as any PR machine would be used by a company or another government organisation.&quot;

Online activists referred to the sponsorship as a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; and &quot;a bloody disgrace&quot; with Stop Brisbane Coal Trains spokesman John Gordon calling for the logos to be removed. Santos responded by stating that the company was &quot;proud to support a program that promotes safe driving and is saving lives in outback Australia.&quot; Queensland&#x27;s Police Minister Jack Dempsey defended the program and its sponsors stating &quot;The Queensland Police Service&#x27;s &#x27;Stay on Track Outback&#x27; is a road safety program aimed at keeping communities safer and reducing road trauma in regional Queensland. It has been in place since 2012 thanks to support from a number of sponsors.&quot;

In 2015, the Frack Free NT Alliance (a diverse group of opposing shale gas in the Northern Territory) called for the Darwin Festival to reject Santos sponsorship due to the company&#x27;s involvement in shale gas exploration and development in the Northern Territory. Dayne Pratzky, &quot;Frackman&quot;, supported the call. On 19 October 2022, Santos announced they would not renew their 20 year funding agreement with the Darwin Festival.

In 2021 and 2022, Extinction Rebellion held protests at the Adelaide Botanic Garden to denounce Santos&#x27; sponsorship of the Santos Museum of Economic Botany. Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Ben Brooker described the arrangement, slated to last until 2029, as &quot;a terrible stain on this treasured institution&quot; and one that &quot;goes absolutely against the letter and the spirit of the Garden&#x27;s own charter, which of course has biodiversity and conservation at its heart&quot;, adding that &quot;we just do not feel that those values are compatible with taking money from an incredibly destructive fossil fuel company&quot;.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Debret (; 18 April 1768 – 28 June 1848) was a French painter, who produced many valuable lithographs depicting the people of Brazil. Debret won the second prize at the 1798 Salon des Beaux Arts.

==Biography==

Debret studied at the French Academy of Fine Arts, a pupil of the great Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) to whom he was related. He accompanied David to Rome in the 1780s. His debut was at the Salon des Beaux Arts of 1798, where he got the second prize.

He travelled to Brazil in March 1816 as a member of the so-called French Artistic Mission, a group of bonapartist French artists and artisans bound to creating an arts and crafts lyceum in Rio de Janeiro (Escola Real de Artes e Ofícios) under the auspices of King D. João VI and the Count of Barca. The lyceum later became the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts) under Emperor Dom Pedro I.

As a painter favored first by the Portuguese court in exile and later by the imperial court in Rio, Debret was often commissioned to paint portraits of many of its members, such as Portuguese king Dom João VI and the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, the first empress of Brazil, who married D. Pedro I (Debret was commissioned to produce a painting of her arrival for the marriage at the Rio port, as well as the public acclaiming of the new Emperor). He established his at the Imperial Academy in December 1822 and became a valued teacher in 1826. In 1829 Debret organized the first arts exhibition ever to take place in Brazil, in which he presented many of his works as well as of his disciples. Emulating David&#x27;s role during the French Empire, Debret was also involved in the drawing ornaments for many of public ceremonies and official festivities of the court and even some of the courtier&#x27;s uniforms are credited to him.

He corresponded frequently with his brother in Paris. After noticing his brother&#x27;s interest in his depiction of everyday life in Brazil, he started to sketch street scenes, local costumes and relations of the Brazilians in the period between 1816 and 1831. He took a particular interest in slavery of blacks and in the indigenous peoples in Brazil. Together with the German painter Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802–1858), his work is one of the most important graphic documentation of life in Brazil during the early decades of the 19th century.

Debret returned to France in 1831 and became a member of the Academie des Beaux Arts. From 1834 to 1839 he published his monumental series of three volumes of engravings, titled &quot;Voyage Pittoresque et Historique au Brésil, ou Séjour d&#x27;un Artiste Français au Brésil&quot; (&quot;A Picturesque and Historic Voyage to Brazil, or the Sojourn of a French Artist in Brazil&quot;).
Unfortunately the work was not a commercial success. In order to survive, he made lithographs depicting paintings by his distant cousin David, but the editions were very limited and money was short. Debret died poor in Paris in 1848.

<text>Conny and Johanna Strandberg is a Swedish sidecarcross team, and one of very few male-female teams in this sport. They started racing in 1998 for the fun of it, only doing one race. Continued until 2005 after they missed the Swedish Championship&#x27;s third place in 2004 by two points (ending up in fourth place), yet making their best result ever.
First mixed team to take World Championships points, in 2002 and then again in 2003.
Throughout their career they changed appearance many times, with new colour schemes on bike and clothes every year. Only in 2004 did they keep the same colours.

In 2009 they made a brief comeback for one season.

Conny Strandberg (born 1960), Swedish sidecarcross driver. Started driving in 1984, best results in 199x, Swedish Championships second. Had several passengers, most famous of them Henrik Söderkvist in 1991-93 (who went on to become Swedish Champion in 1999-2004 as a driver with Tobias Sylwan as passenger) and Johanna Jeppsson, 1998-2004 (J Strandberg from 2002). Finished his career in 2004 with an overall fourth place in the Swedish Championships.

Johanna Strandberg (born Jeppsson, 1979), Swedish sidecarcross passenger. She is the most successful of very few female sidecar passengers (no drivers are known). Followed in her fathers (Gösta Jeppsson) footsteps with then boyfriend Conny Strandberg as they raced in the final Swedish Championship of 1997 just for the fun of it. They did well and decided to continue. Raced in the Swedish and Danish Championships as well as the World GPs throughout Europe and became the first woman to take GP points, at the Estonian GP in 2002. In 2010, Johanna continued as a sidecarcross passenger and teamed up with Magnus Birgersson from Varberg, after Conny felt unable to continue after the 2009 season.

He has twice been named as one of &quot;Granta&quot;″s Best of Young British Novelists. In 2015 he received the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is an advisory editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

==Life==

Thirlwell was educated at the independent Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, Elstree. He read English at New College, Oxford, where he got the top first. He was a Prize Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford between 2000 and 2007, and worked as assistant editor at the literary magazine Areté. He now lives in London. In 2011 he was the S Fischer Guest Professor of Comparative Literature at the Freie Universität Berlin. In 2015 he was announced as an Honorary Fellow of the Metaphysical Club at the Domus Academy in Milan.

==Work==

Thirlwell is the author of four novels: &quot;Politics&quot; (2003), &quot;The Escape&quot; (2009) described by Milan Kundera as &quot;a novel where the humour is melancholic, the melancholy mischievous, and the talent startling&quot;, &quot;Lurid &amp; Cute&quot; (2015). and &quot;The Future Future&quot; (2023).

He is also the author of a project on the novel and translation, which includes a book first published in 2007, which was chosen as a book of the year by Tom Stoppard in The Guardian and A. S. Byatt in the Times Literary Supplement; and, as guest editor, &quot;Multiples&quot;, an anthology of multiple translations for McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly. In 2019 he created &quot;Studio Créole&quot;, a group show with novelists and interpreters, co-curated with Hans Ulrich Obrist, which premiered at Manchester International Festival in July.

An experimental book with unfolding pages called &quot;Kapow!&quot;, designed by Studio Frith, was published by Visual Editions in 2012. It was nominated for the Design Museum&#x27;s 2013 Designs of the Year awards and has been included in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. A book with the artist Philippe Parreno, &quot;Conversation&quot;, was published by Serralves Museum in 2017.

Thirlwell wrote a short film, &quot;Everyday Performance Artists&quot;, for Channel 4&#x27;s Random Acts, directed by Polly Stenham and starring the voice of Shia LaBeouf, with Gemma Chan, James Norton, and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, in 2016. In 2018, he wrote and directed &quot;Utopia&quot;, starring Lily Cole, Lily McMenamy and Babirye Bukilwa.

He has written columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;. In May 2015, he was named London editor of the &quot;Paris Review&quot;.

In June 2018 Thirlwell was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in its &quot;40 Under 40&quot; initiative.

<doc id="1140952" wikidata="Q7989147" url="?curid=1140952" title="Westminster College (Cambridge)">
<text>Westminster College in Cambridge, England is a theological college of the United Reformed Church. Its principal purpose is training for the ordination of ministers, but is also used more widely for training within the denomination.

==History==
The college was founded in London in 1844 with a temporary home in the Exeter Hall in the Strand, before moving to permanent premises in Queen&#x27;s Square, London in 1859. It then moved to Cambridge in 1899 following the gift of a prime site of land near the centre of the city by two Scottish sisters, Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson, both noted biblical scholars. Following an appeal for funds from the wider Presbyterian congregation, the college commissioned a new building designed by Henry Hare and built between 1897 and 1899. In 1967 the college began to amalgamate with Cheshunt College, Cambridge, presaging the union of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches to form the United Reformed Church in 1972.

The dedication of a new college chapel took place in 1921; it was given by Sir William Noble, 1st Baronet and his wife Margaret. The gift was to commemorate the death of their son William Black Noble in World War I. The 11 stained glass windows are by Douglas Strachan. The decoration of the apse was completed in 1929 by W. Jowsey.
===Lewis and Gibson===
Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson were noted for their study of one of the earliest versions of the Old Gospels, in the Syriac Sinaiticus manuscript discovered in Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. The other important contributions to the field of Aramaic and Theology are the publications of the Codex Climaci Rescriptus, a 6th-century palimpsest written in Christian Palestinian Aramaic which contains portions of the Old Testament and New Testament, and another palimpsest manuscript of the Forty Martyrs of the Sinai desert and the Story of Eulogios, the Stone Cutter in the same Aramaic dialect. The sisters found the manuscripts in the antiquities market of Cairo and acquired them for the library in Westminster College. They were sold in 2010 to the Green Collection, displayed in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. They edited also many other important manuscripts in Syriac and Arabic.

In 1897 Lewis and Gibson also found and purchased some fragments of parchment of the Cairo Genizah whilst travelling in the Middle East. With the support of Solomon Schechter they made several more trips to the Middle East, locating the majority of the Genizah at the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. Schechter identified the fragments as forming part of the Hebrew Wisdom of Sirach.

The Cairo Genizah collection was put up for sale by Westminster College for £1.2 million in 2013. The two Oxbridge libraries, the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford and Cambridge&#x27;s Cambridge University Library combined to raise funds to buy the collection from Westminster after it was put up for sale. This is the first time the two libraries have collaborated for such a fundraising effort. The money was used by Westminster College to help finance a £7 million refurbishment of the College in 2013–2014.

==Today==
The college is not part of the University of Cambridge, but has joined with six other religious colleges in Cambridge to form the Cambridge Theological Federation, which is affiliated with the university.

Currently, Westminster has connected with it around 50 students; some in training for ministry in the United Reformed Church, and some studying for other work or pleasure. Westminster is served by five academic staff, covering the traditional theological disciplines of Systematic Theology, Church History, Old Testament Studies, New Testament Studies and Pastoral Studies. Traditionally, most students have studied for four years, which includes an internship year working in a local church. However, the College now trains many students part-time and via distance learning, as well as through full-time in-house courses. Most students still work, nonetheless, either for a BA or MA degree (awarded by Anglia Ruskin University) or a BTh or BA/Tripos degree (awarded by Cambridge University).

Since 2017 the Westminster College site has also been home to the Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths and Faraday Institute for Science and Religion.

Westminster College is also affiliated with the American writer and Presbyterian theologian, Frederick Buechner. The College awards an annual prize for Excellence in Writing named after the author.

==Notable alumni==
Notable former students include
* Thomas Walter Manson, the biblical scholar and Rylands Professor in the University of Manchester
* Lesslie Newbigin, ecumenist, bishop, scholar and pioneer of the Church of South India
* William Paton, a precursor to Newbigin and a seminal figure in modern ecumenism
* W. D. Davies, known for his work on Paul and his Jewish background

==Notable staff==
* Patrick Carnegie Simpson, Professor of Church History from 1914 to 1937
* James Oswald Dykes, Principal and Barbour Professor of Divinity from 1888 to 1907
* Herbert Henry Farmer, Barbour Professor of Systematic Theology from 1935 to 1960

<text>William Knight (1572 – 29 November 1596) was an English layman put to death for his Catholic faith at York, England. With him also suffered George Errington of Herst, Northumberland; William Gibson of Ripon; and Henry Abbot of Howden, Yorkshire.

==Life==
Knight, apparently a secret convert to the Catholic Church, was the son of a Leonard Knight and lived at South Duffield, a hamlet currently in the Selby District of North Yorkshire. On coming of age, he claimed from his uncle some property which had been left to him by his father, an Anglican, and his uncle denounced him to the authorities for being a Roman Catholic. He was at once seized and committed to the custody of Roger Colyer, a pursuivant, who treated him with indignity and severity. 

He was sent in October 1593, to York Castle, where William Gibson and George Errington were already confined, the latter having been arrested some years before for participation in a rising in the North.

A Church of England clergyman was among the prisoners at York. To gain his freedom, he had recourse to an act of treachery: feigning a desire to convert to the Roman Church, he won the confidence of Knight and his two companions, who explained their faith to him. With the connivance of the authorities, he was directed to Henry Abbot, then at liberty, who endeavoured to procure a priest to reconcile him to the Church. When the minister had sufficient evidence, Abbot was arrested and, together with Knight and his two comrades, accused of attempting to persuade the clergyman to embrace Roman Catholicism — an act of treason under the penal laws. The men were found guilty, and, with the exception of Abbot who was executed later, suffered hanging, drawing and quartering at York on 29 November 1596. Knight was about 24 years old when he died.

Knight was one of the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987 during a trip to Great Britain.

<text>William Gibson (1548 – 29 November 1596) was a layman from Ripon in Yorkshire, England, a member of a noble Scottish family, who was executed at York for professing the Roman Catholic faith. He is honoured as a martyr by the Catholic Church.

With him also suffered George Errington of Herst, Northumberland; William Knight of South Duffield and (after a short reprieve) Henry Abbot of Howden, also in Yorkshire.

==Life==
Gibson was the son of Lord George Gibson II (+1590) of Goldingstones, Fife, Scotland, a judge of the High Court of Scotland, who was a &quot;free baron&quot; under charter of King James IV of Scotland. His great-uncle and namesake, Bishop William Gibson, Dean of Restalrig, had been one of the leading Catholic clergymen in Scotland prior to the Scottish Reformation. He frequently represented King James V to the Holy See, and, with the support of Cardinal David Beaton, his writings in defence of the Catholic faith had earned him the papal title of &quot;Guardian of the Scottish Church&quot; ().

The younger William Gibson was accused of treason for being a Catholic and denounced to the authorities. He was at once seized and committed to the custody of a pursuivant, Roger Colyer, who treated him with indignity and severity.

Gibson was sent in August 1593 to York Castle, where he was joined shortly thereafter by fellow future martyrs William Knight and George Errington, both arrested for participation in a rising.

A certain Anglican clergyman chanced to be among their fellow prisoners. To gain his freedom he had recourse to an act of treachery: feigning a desire to become a Roman Catholic, he won the confidence of Gibson and his two companions, who explained their faith to him. With the connivance of the authorities, he was directed to Henry Abbot, then at liberty, who endeavoured to procure a priest to reconcile him to the Catholic Church. When the clergyman had sufficient evidence, Gibson was arrested and, together with Knight and his two comrades, accused of attempting to persuade the clergyman to embrace Catholicism — an act of treason under the English Penal Laws. They were all found guilty, before (with the exception of Abbot, who was executed later) suffering hanging, drawing and quartering at York on 29 November 1596.

Gibson was one of the Eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987 in the course of a visit to the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1140978" wikidata="Q2068744" url="?curid=1140978" title="The Maids">
<text>The Maids ( ) is a 1947 play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. It was first performed at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed.
The play has been revived in France, the UK, and the United States on multiple occasions, sometimes with men playing the roles of the maids. A TV dramatization Stuepigerne was done by Danish national broadcaster Danmarks Radio in 1962. A film adaptation of the play was released in 1974. Swedish composer adapted the play in 1994 for a chamber opera.
==Background==
Genet loosely based his play on the infamous sisters Christine and Léa Papin, who brutally murdered their employer and her daughter in Le Mans, France, in 1933. In an introduction written for &quot;The Maids&quot;, Jean-Paul Sartre quotes a line from Genet&#x27;s novel &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; in which a character muses that if he had a play written for women he&#x27;d cast adolescent boys in the parts. Sartre then speculates on having this idea applied to &quot;The Maids&quot;.

==Plot==
Solange and Claire are two sisters who are housemaids. When their mistress (Madame) is away, they take turns role-playing Madame while the other plays her maid. In this way, they portray both sides of the power divide. Each, when playing Madame, demeans and abases her sister. There is a 
&quot;furtive&quot; eroticism to their interactions. 

The ultimate goal of their role-playing is carrying out the real murder of Madame as the only way to free themselves of subjugation. The maids&#x27; deliberate pace, their emotionally-charged arguments, and their devotion to detail guarantee that they always fail to actualize their fantasies of ceremoniously &quot;killing&quot; Madame at the ritual&#x27;s dénouement with unexpected consequences.

==Characters==
* Solange - Maid/sister
* Claire - Maid/sister
* Madame - Haughty, disdainful mistress
* Monsieur - Madame&#x27;s lover and thief

==Production history==
In Britain, the play was first presented in French by the Institute of Contemporary Arts, initially at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, London, in 1952. Peter Zadek directed, while Eduardo Paolozzi provided the scenic design. Selma Vaz Dias played Solange, Olive Gregg played Claire, and Oriel Ross played Madame. The production subsequently transferred to the Royal Court Theatre, where Betty Stockfeld played Madame and David de Bethel provided the scenic design. Zadek also directed the play&#x27;s first production in Britain in English, which opened on 5 June 1956 at the New Lindsey Theatre Club. Selma Vaz Dias again played Solange and Betty Stockfeld played Madame, while Hazel Penwarden played Claire.

The play was produced at Tempo Playhouse in New York City in 1955, with Julie Bovasso originally as Claire and later as Solange. Bovasso won the first best actress Obie Award for &quot;The Maids&quot;.

Minos Volanakis directed the play at the Oxford Playhouse in 1963. This production was reprised in 1964 in a double bill with Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Exception and the Rule&quot;.

The play was revived in London at the Greenwich Theatre in 1973 with the actresses Vivien Merchant as Madame, Glenda Jackson as Solange and Susannah York as Claire. This production was filmed as part of the American Film Theatre series in 1974, directed by Christopher Miles and photographed by Douglas Slocombe. Miles and Slocombe planned the 12-day shoot with a single camera which could track anywhere over the set, and deliberately implemented many of Genet&#x27;s theatrical devices for the film.
The 1987 Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production at The Barbican (The Pit) was directed by Gerard Murphy, designed by David Ultz and starred Miles Anderson as Claire, Gerard Murphy as Solange, and Patrick Bailey as Madam. It was twinned with &quot;Deathwatch&quot; with the same actors.

Clare Davidson directed it at Dublin Theatre Festival; subsequently at The Lyric Theatre Studio Hammersmith on 12 October 1981 with Mark Rylance as Madame.

Cesear&#x27;s Forum, a minimalist theatre company, produced the play in Chicago in 1990. Claire and Solange were portrayed by male actors in drag but Madame was cast female. In his Chicago Reader review, Albert Williams writes: &quot;Genet deliberately sought to invoke the sense of ceremony expressed in (as he wrote to his publisher) &#x27;the sacrifice of the Mass&#x27;...the endless shifting of roles among the women, and the patent artificiality of the female impersonation are the poetic means by which the playwright explores his themes...&quot;

In Canada, a 2011 production at Buddies in Bad Times in Toronto, Ontario, used female and male casting, with the roles of Solange and Claire played by Diane D&#x27;Aquila and Ron Kennell.

A 2013 Sydney Theatre Company production, adapted by Andrew Upton and directed by Benedict Andrews, starred Cate Blanchett as Claire, Isabelle Huppert as Solange, and Elizabeth Debicki as the Mistress. The production was shown as part of the Lincoln Center Festival in August 2014 at New York City Center. Andrews employed contemporary devices that combined theatre with film in his use of video cameras, stylized choreography, popular “underground” music soundtracks, liberal use of profanity, and cultural modernization such as off handed comments from the Mistress on her dresses: &quot;McQueen designed it for me.&quot;

In 2016 a production starring Uzo Aduba and Zawe Ashton as Solange and Claire, and Laura Carmichael as Mistress, was directed by Jamie Lloyd and performed at Trafalgar Studios in London. The script was from the same translation as the 2013 Andrews-directed performance.

In Australia, a 2021 production starring Marta Dusseldorp and Essie Davis as Solange and Claire, and Stephanie Jack as Mistress, was directed by Ben Winspear and performed at The Playhouse Theatre in Hobart.

<text>In mathematics, racks and quandles are sets with binary operations satisfying axioms analogous to the Reidemeister moves used to manipulate knot diagrams.

While mainly used to obtain invariants of knots, they can be viewed as algebraic constructions in their own right. In particular, the definition of a quandle axiomatizes the properties of conjugation in a group.

==History==
In 1942, introduced an algebraic structure which he called a (), which would later come to be known as an involutive quandle. His motivation was to find a nonassociative algebraic structure to capture the notion of a reflection in the context of finite geometry. The idea was rediscovered and generalized in an unpublished 1959 correspondence between John Conway and Gavin Wraith, who at the time were undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge. It is here that the modern definitions of quandles and of racks first appear. Wraith had become interested in these structures (which he initially dubbed sequentials) while at school. Conway renamed them wracks, partly as a pun on his colleague&#x27;s name, and partly because they arise as the remnants (or &#x27;wrack and ruin&#x27;) of a group when one discards the multiplicative structure and considers only the conjugation structure. The spelling &#x27;rack&#x27; has now become prevalent.

These constructs surfaced again in the 1980s: in a 1982 paper by David Joyce (where the term quandle, an arbitrary nonsense word, was coined), in a 1982 paper by Sergei Matveev (under the name distributive groupoids) and in a 1986 conference paper by Egbert Brieskorn (where they were called automorphic sets). A detailed overview of racks and their applications in knot theory may be found in the paper by Colin Rourke and Roger Fenn.

==Racks==
A rack may be defined as a set formula_1 with a binary operation formula_2 such that for every formula_3 the self-distributive law holds:
:formula_4

and for every formula_5 there exists a unique formula_6 such that 
:formula_7

This definition, while terse and commonly used, is suboptimal for certain purposes because it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary. To avoid this, we may write the unique formula_6 such that formula_9 as formula_10 We then have
:formula_11

and thus 
:formula_12

and
:formula_13

Using this idea, a rack may be equivalently defined as a set formula_1 with two binary operations formula_15 and formula_16 such that for all formula_17
#formula_18 (left self-distributive law)
#formula_19 (right self-distributive law)
#formula_20
#formula_21

It is convenient to say that the element formula_22 is acting from the left in the expression formula_23 and acting from the right in the expression formula_10 The third and fourth rack axioms then say that these left and right actions are inverses of each other. Using this, we can eliminate either one of these actions from the definition of rack. If we eliminate the right action and keep the left one, we obtain the terse definition given initially.

Many different conventions are used in the literature on racks and quandles. For example, many authors prefer to work with just the &quot;right&quot; action. Furthermore, the use of the symbols formula_2 and formula_16 is by no means universal: many authors use exponential notation
:formula_27

and
:formula_28

while many others write
:formula_29

Yet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as automorphisms of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one. In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws:

:formula_30

which are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier.

==Quandles==
A quandle is defined as an idempotent rack, formula_31 such that for all formula_32
: formula_33

or equivalently
: formula_34

==Examples and applications==
Every group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation:
: formula_35

In fact, every equational law satisfied by conjugation in a group follows from the quandle axioms. So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation.

Every tame knot in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a &#x27;fundamental quandle&#x27;. To define this, one can note that the fundamental group of the knot complement, or knot group, has a presentation (the Wirtinger presentation) in which the relations only involve conjugation. So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle. The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots. In particular, if two knots have isomorphic fundamental quandles then there is a homeomorphism of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be orientation reversing, taking one knot to the other.

Less powerful but more easily computable invariants of knots may be obtained by counting the homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a fixed quandle formula_36 Since the Wirtinger presentation has one generator for each strand in a knot diagram, these invariants can be computed by counting ways of labelling each strand by an element of formula_31 subject to certain constraints. More sophisticated invariants of this sort can be constructed with the help of quandle cohomology.

The are also important, since they can be used to compute the Alexander polynomial of a knot. Let formula_38 be a module over the ring formula_39 of Laurent polynomials in one variable. Then the Alexander quandle is formula_38 made into a quandle with the left action given by
:formula_41

Racks are a useful generalization of quandles in topology, since while quandles can represent knots on a round linear object (such as rope or a thread), racks can represent ribbons, which may be twisted as well as knotted.

A quandle formula_42 is said to be involutory if for all formula_43
: formula_44

or equivalently,
: formula_45

Any symmetric space gives an involutory quandle, where formula_46 is the result of &#x27;reflecting formula_47 through formula_48&#x27;.

<text>Jean Baptiste Abbeloos (15 January 1836 – 25 February 1906) was a Belgian orientalist and Rector of the University of Leuven.

==Life==
He was born on 15 January 1836 in Gooik, Belgium. He was educated at the junior seminary and the Major Seminary, Mechelen from 1849 to 1860. After his ordination to the priesthood on 22 September 1860, he studied at Leuven and Rome, devoting himself especially to Syriac language and literature. He received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Leuven on 15 July 1867 and spent the following winter in London.

On his return to Belgium, he was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture in the seminary of Mechelen. Failing health obliged him to abandon the work of teaching, and he became, in 1876, pastor at Duffel. He was appointed in 1883 vicar-general under Cardinal Deschamps and held that position until 10 February 1887, when he was appointed Rector of the University of Leuven.

During his administration the University grew rapidly in equipment and organization. He retired in 1900 and died on 25 February 1906.

Though not mentioned by Hugo von Hurter in the &quot;Nomenclator,&quot; he has left many theological works, among which are five volumes in quarto on the Incarnation and the Sacraments; one in quarto on Grace, and several minor treatises on moral and dogmatic subjects. He wrote also extensively on points of history, via: &quot;The Historical Annals of the Kings of Aragon,&quot; &quot;The First Kings of Pampeluna,&quot; and has left many manuscripts and one work, which he withheld, about the Church of del Pilar.

<text>Abbo Cernuus (&quot;the Crooked&quot;), Abbo Parisiensis, or Abbo of Saint-Germain (c. 850c. 923) was a Neustrian Benedictine monk and poet of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. He was born about the middle of the ninth century.

Abbo was present at the Siege of Paris by the Vikings in 885–886. He was the only eyewitness who wrote a description of it, in Latin verse, with an account of subsequent events to 896, the so-called &quot;De bellis Parisiacæ urbis&quot; or &quot;Bella Parisiacæ urbis&quot; (&quot;Wars of the City of Paris&quot;). Abbo also left some sermons for the instruction of clerics in Paris and Poitiers (&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;, CXXXII).

==Life==
Though coming from one of the most prominent ecclesiastical centres of ninth-century Francia, the monk Abbo is unusually obscure for an individual responsible for a source such as the &quot;De bellis&quot;. The little that is known about him is gleaned from this work, with very little corroboratory evidence from elsewhere. Though he was a Neustrian, there is no information regarding his political agenda or affiliations, as he contradicts his own &quot;views&quot; throughout the work. As a result, historians have often speculated that the &quot;De bellis&quot; was &quot;refined&quot; at a later date by a separate editor.

Abbo can be viewed as a source for the collapse of Carolingian hegemony in 887–88. He regarded Odo as the legitimate successor of Charles the Fat in West Francia after Charles&#x27; death (888) and does not seem to have regarded the deposition of East Francia as binding on West Francia. Abbo also regards the empire as Frankish and he himself, though a Neustrian and Parisian, as Frankish as well. He does not present a united West Francia as a more basic political unit than the empire and is therefore seen by some historians as refuting the hypothesis that regional identities led to the break-up of the empire within Abbo&#x27;s lifetime.

In 921, Abbo published some of his sermons at the insistence of Bishop Fulrad of Paris, who held office from 921 - 927. His publications under Fulrad are the last indications of Abbo in French records, causing ambiguity about the year of his death. His death has no definitive date, though it has been assumed to be sometime after 922, given his relationship with Fulrad.

==&quot;De bellis Parisiacæ urbis&quot;==
The &quot;Wars of the City of Paris&quot; was written in the 890s. The poem narrates events taking place over an eleven-year period from 885 to 896. It was first composed around 890 and later extended up to 896. The entire poem consists of 1,393 lines in three books: 660 lines in the first book, 618 in the second, and 115 in the third. Throughout the poem Abbo employs a dactylic hexameter, though with the occasional fault. This metre helps to underpin the epic nature of the poem, a conscious aim of Abbo. The purpose of the work was both scholarly and hortative, warning future generations of the Viking menace. Its polemic literary style (sometimes called the &quot;hermeneutic style&quot;) is typical of its period and place, though it is studded with &quot;obscure Grecisms.&quot; It has usually received negative criticism from historians, or even been viewed as a contemporary parody of the hermeneutic style.

A detailed and political work, it has been underused by historians of the late Carolingians. It may have been written at the request or insistence of Odo of France, who appears as the hero and &quot;future king&quot; (&quot;rex futurus&quot;) in the poem. The poet views Odo through the lens of the 890s. He praises Odo as &quot;the noblest&quot; of the city of Paris, more so than Askericus or Joscelin. Abbo also presents the Emperor Charles III, whom he refers to as &quot;basileus Francorum&quot; (&quot;emperor of the Franks&quot;), in a positive light. The poem stresses the magnitude and diversity of the united Frankish empire. Significantly, he places no blame on the emperor for the siege of Paris nor for the subsequent harrying of Burgundy, which he actually considered to be appropriate for the Burgundians&#x27; refusal to aid the city. Abbo even warns the Neustrians not to use &quot;the purple to keep warm&quot;, a reference to over-reliance on imperial protection, purple being an imperial colour. The term &quot;basileus&quot; is likewise a distinctly Byzantine term.

Overall the &quot;De bellis&quot; seems less concerned with historical accuracy than with theology, preferring to ask why Paris was besieged by the Vikings and to speculate on the spiritual battle that &quot;must&quot; have occurred. Since this theme is most prominent in Book III, it has been treated with neglect by historians of the period. Henri Waquet even chose to omit it from his edition of the work entirely.

<text>A Zabel is a German two-stroke motocross engine, mainly used in Sidecarcross.

Zabel engines have won the Sidecarcross world championship in 1998 - driven by Kristers Sergis from Latvia then 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012 driven by Daniel Willemsen from the Netherlands at 2015 with Kaspars and Etienne at 2017 with Etienne and Nicolas Musset and at 2018 with Ben van den and driver as Marvine.

Prior to 1990 a 610cc Zabel manufactured big-bore conversion was available for large bore Maico motocross engines. From 1990 to 1996 both 620cc and 685cc versions of Zabel&#x27;s own engine were available. The 620 version was then discontinued with the 685cc version remaining available until the end of 1998. In 1999 a new 700cc version of the engine was released with hydraulic clutch and many modifications. This engine has been in continuous development since. The most recent ZM29 model was released in 2010 but improved to be ZM30.

<text>Giethoorn () is a village in the province of Overijssel, Netherlands, with a population of 2,795 in 2020. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, about southwest of Steenwijk. As a popular Dutch tourist destination both within the Netherlands and abroad, Giethoorn is often referred to as &quot;Dutch Venice&quot; () or the &quot;Venice of the Netherlands&quot;.

==History==
Giethoorn used to be a pedestrian precinct, but nowadays exceptions are made. It became locally famous, especially after 1958, when the Dutch filmmaker Bert Haanstra made his famous comedy &quot;Fanfare&quot; there. In the old part of the village, there were no roads (though a cycling path was eventually added), and all transport was undertaken by water over one of the many canals. The lakes in Giethoorn were formed by peat digging.

Giethoorn was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became part of Brederwiede, which subsequently lost its municipality status in 2001 to merge with Steenwijk.

==Tourism==
Tourism has been an influence on the old traditional town. The village, still fully accessible only by boat, is one of several places commonly known as the Venice of the North or &quot;Venice of the Netherlands&quot;. Giethoorn has 176 bridges.

===Monopoly edition===
In 2015, the village of Giethoorn was chosen from 182 contenders across the world to achieve a place on the board of the new international edition of Monopoly. An online campaign led by local Village Marketeer Giethoorn.com resulted in enough votes to obtain spot number 21 in the special edition.

<text>Henry Thomas Hare (1860–1921) was a British architect who was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire and educated in Sheffield and Harrogate.

==Career==
At the age of 16 he was articled to the Scarborough architect C A Bury but left after four years to complete his studies at the Atelier Ginain in Paris. He returned to London in 1878 to work as an assistant to the London architects King + Hill, and in 1886 passed the associateship examination for entry to the Royal Institute of British Architects, (RIBA) receiving the Asphitel Prize for passing with the highest marks.

Hare set up his own practice in London in 1891, often working in collaboration with others. He was well-respected, serving on RIBA Council for many years, being President of the Architectural Association in 1902 and later becoming a Vice-President and then President of the RIBA from 1917 to 1919. He died in January 1921.

Hare&#x27;s trademark was including an etching or carving of a hare in every building he designed.

<doc id="1141025" wikidata="Q1966775" url="?curid=1141025" title="Commendatory abbot">
<text>A commendatory abbot () is an ecclesiastic, or sometimes a layman, who holds an abbey &quot;in commendam&quot;, drawing its revenues but not exercising any authority over its inner monastic discipline. If a commendatory abbot is an ecclesiastic, however, he may have limited jurisdiction.

Originally only vacant abbeys, or those that were temporarily without an actual superior, were given &quot;in commendam&quot;, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed. An abbey is held &quot;in commendam&quot;, i.e. provisorily, in distinction to one held &quot;in titulum&quot;, which is a permanent benefice.

==History==

Originally only vacant abbeys, or such as were temporarily without an actual superior, were given in commendam, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed.
Pope Gregory the Great (590–604) on various occasions gave vacant abbeys &quot;in commendam&quot; to bishops who had been driven from their episcopal sees by invading barbarians or whose own churches were too poor to furnish them a decent livelihood.

The practice began to be seriously abused in the eighth century when the Anglo-Saxon and Frankish kings assumed the right to set commendatory abbots over monasteries that were occupied by religious communities. Often these commendatory abbots were laymen, vassals of the kings, or others who were authorized to draw the revenues and manage the temporal affairs of the monasteries in reward for military services. The practice was especially widespread during the reigns of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Philip I of France, William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry I and Henry II of England. Such a system often proved disastrous for monastic discipline, as the commendatory “abbot” of the community was rarely a monk, nor was he often even present in the monastery.

Such a system divided the revenues of the monastery between the &quot;mensa abbatialis&quot; (the “abbot’s table”) and the &quot;mensa conventualis&quot; (the “monk’s table”) The commendatory abbot would take his portion, thereby reducing the resources of the monks. It was a common arrangement that the commendatory abbot would retain two thirds of the revenue for his own use and leave the remaining third for the support of the abbey. The commendatory bishop was bound to defray the expenses of the community, to keep the buildings in repair, to furnish the ornaments for divine service, and to give suitable alms. Nonetheless, many did not and buildings fell into disrepair and new members could even be turned away on account of a simple lack of funds.

After the eighth century various attempts were made by popes and councils to regulate the appointment of commendatory abbots. At the Concordat of Worms in 1122, when the Investiture Controversy was settled in favour of the church, the appointment of laymen as commendatory abbots was abolished. The practice again increased during the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) and especially during the Papal Schism (1378–1417), when the papal claimants gave numerous abbeys &quot;in commendam&quot; in order to increase the number of their adherents.
Boniface VIII (1294–1303) decreed that a benefice with the cure of souls attached should be granted &quot;in commendam&quot; only in great necessity or when evident advantage would accrue to the Church, but never for more than six months. Clement V (1305–1314) revoked benefices which had been granted by him &quot;in commendam&quot; earlier. The Council of Trent determined that vacant monasteries should be bestowed only on pious and virtuous regulars, and that the motherhouse of an order, and the abbeys and priories founded immediately from it, should no longer be granted &quot;in commendam&quot;. The succeeding bull &quot;Superna&quot; of Gregory XIII and the constitution &quot;Pastoralis&quot; of Innocent X greatly checked &quot;in commendam&quot; appointments but did not abolish them entirely. In spite of various efforts to reform such a system, it continued to plague the monastic orders throughout the centuries.

Especially in France, they continued to flourish to the detriment of the monasteries; for example Cluny Abbey. On the eve of the French Revolution of 1789, of the two-hundred-thirty-seven Cistercian institutions in France, only thirty-five were governed by regular Cistercian abbots.

Finally the French Revolution and the general secularization of monasteries in the beginning of the eighteenth century reduced the significance of commendatory abbots along with the significance of monasteries in general. Since that time commendatory abbots have become very rare, and the former abuses have been abolished by careful regulations. There are still a few commendatory abbots among the cardinals; Pope Pius X himself was Commendatory Abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Subiaco near Rome.

==Authority==
If the monastery is occupied by a religious community where there is a separate &quot;mensa abbatialis&quot;, i.e. where the abbot and the convent have each a separate income, the commendatory abbot, who must then be an ecclesiastic, has jurisdiction &quot;in foro externo&quot; over the members of the community and enjoys all the rights and privileges of an actual abbot.

Under the title of Claustral Prior a regular superior was appointed to supervise the internal discipline of the house. If there is no separate &quot;mensa abbatialis&quot;, the power of the commendatory abbot extends only over the temporal affairs of the monastery. In case of vacant monasteries the commendatory abbot generally has all the rights and privileges of an actual abbot.

<doc id="1141036" wikidata="Q4536735" url="?curid=1141036" title="Lay abbot">
<text>Lay [[abbot]] (, ) is a name used to designate a layman on whom a king or someone in authority bestowed an abbey as a reward for services rendered; he had charge of the estate belonging to it, and was entitled to part of the income. The custom existed principally in the Frankish Empire from the eighth century until the ecclesiastical reforms of the eleventh.

==Background==
Numerous synods held in France in the sixth and seventh centuries passed decrees against this abuse of church property. The Merovingians had bestowed church lands on laymen, or at least allowed them their possession and use, though not ownership. The Merovingian kings were also in the habit of appointing abbots to monasteries which they had founded; moreover, many monasteries, though not founded by the king, placed themselves under royal patronage in order to share his protection, and so became possessions of the Crown.

==History==
This custom of the Merovingian rulers was taken as a precedent by the French kings for rewarding laymen with abbeys, or giving them to bishops &quot;in commendam&quot;. Charles Martel was the first to bestow outright extensive existing ecclesiastical property upon laymen, political friends and soldiers. St. Boniface and later Hincmar of Reims picture most dismally the consequent downfall of church discipline, and though Boniface tried to reform the Frankish Church, the bestowal of abbeys on secular abbots was not abolished.

Charlemagne also frequently gave church property, and sometimes abbeys, in feudal tenure. The abbey of Saint-Riquier (Centula) in Picardy had secular abbots from the time of Charlemagne, who had given it to his friend Angilbert, the poet and the lover of his daughter Bertha, and father of her two sons. After Angilbert&#x27;s death in 814, the abbey was given to other laymen.

Louis the Pious aided St. Benedict of Aniane in his endeavours to reform the monastic life. In order to accomplish this it was necessary to restore the free election of abbots, and the appointment as well of blameless monks as heads of the monastic houses. Although Louis shared these principles, he continued to bestow abbeys on laymen, and his sons imitated him. Although not a cleric, Einhard was lay abbot of the monastery of St. Bavo in Ghent and at his own foundation at Michelstadt.

Various synods of the ninth century passed decrees against this custom; the Synod of Diedenhofen (October, 844) decreed in its third canon, that abbeys should no longer remain in the power of laymen, but that monks should be their abbots In like manner the Synods of Meaux and Paris (845-846) complained that the monasteries held by laymen had fallen into decay, and emphasized the king&#x27;s duty in this respect. But abbeys continued to be bestowed upon laymen, especially in France and Lorraine, e.g. St. Evre near Toul, in the reign of Lothair I. Lothair II, however, restored it to ecclesiastical control in 858, but the same king gave Bonmoutier to a layman; and the Abbeys of St. Germain and St. Martin, in the Diocese of Toul, were also given to secular abbots. In the Diocese of Metz, the Abbey of Gorze was long in the hands of laymen, and under them fell into decay. Stavelot and Malmedy, in the Diocese of Liège, were in the eleventh century bestowed on a certain Count Raginarius, as also St. Maximin near Trier on a Count Adalhard, etc. In 888 a Synod of Mainz decreed (canon xxv) that the secular abbots should place able provosts and provisors over their monasteries.

In a synod held at Trosly, in the Diocese of Soissons, in 909, sharp complaints were made (ch. iii) about the lives of monks; many convents, it was said, were governed by laymen, whose wives and children, soldiers and dogs, were housed in the precincts of the religious. To better these conditions it was necessary, the synod declared, to restore the regular abbots and abbesses; at the same time ecclesiastical canons and royal capitularies declared laymen quite devoid of authority in church affairs.

Lay abbots existed in the tenth century, also in the eleventh. Crínán of Dunkeld (d. 1045) was the lay abbot of the monastery of Dunkeld. While the title of Hereditary Lay Abbot was a feudal position that was often exercised in name only, Crinán seems to have acted as Abbot in charge of the monastery in his time. He was thus a man of high position in both clerical and secular society.

Gosfred, Duke of Aquitaine, was Abbot of the monastery of St. Hilary at Poitiers, and as such he published the decrees issued (1078) at the Synod of Poitiers. It was only through the so-called investitures conflict that the Church was freed from secular domination; the reforms brought about by the papacy put an end to the bestowal of abbeys upon laymen.

<doc id="1141044" wikidata="Q2821315" url="?curid=1141044" title="Abdias of Babylon">
<text>Legend makes Abdias (or Obadiah) first bishop of Babylon and one of the Seventy Apostles who are collectively mentioned in the &quot;Gospel of Luke&quot; . Saints Simon and Jude allegedly consecrated him as the first Bishop of Babylon. He is also associated with St. Thomas and St. Addai, recognized as the first Patriarch of the Church of the East in Syriac Christianity.

==History of the Apostolical Contest==

An apocryphal work in ten books called &quot;Historia Certaminis Apostolici&quot; (&quot;History of the Apostolical Contest&quot;) was traditionally ascribed to an Abdias, assumed to be this bishop of Babylon. It is a major collection of New Testament apocrypha, which tells of the labors and miracles, persecution and deaths of the Apostles. It exhibits a taste for the marvelous that places the narratives in the genre of heroic romances, of which &quot;these stories came at length to form a sort of apostolic cycle&quot; 

This compilation purports to have been translated from Hebrew into Greek by &quot;Eutropius&quot;, a disciple of Abdias, and, in the third century, from Greek into Latin by Sextus Julius Africanus, the friend of Origen, or as reported in &quot;Golden Legend&quot; by his disciple Tropaeus Africanus.

Later scholarship determined the book was originally written in Latin, probably around 910 AD, long after the death of Abdias of Babylon. The most obvious clues include the book&#x27;s citations of the &quot;Vulgate&quot; of St Jerome, of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of Rufinus and of his Latin translation of the &quot;Recognitiones&quot; of Clement.

An earlier date of composition is given by R. A. Lipsius, who theorizes the work was compiled during the latter half of the sixth century, in an unidentified Frankish monastery, for the purpose of satisfying the natural curiosity of Western Christians. At the same time the author of this &quot;Historia&quot; used much older pseudo-Apostolic materials that he abridged or excerpted to suit his purpose. He often revised or expurgated to conform them to Catholic teaching, because many of the writings that he used were originally Gnostic compositions, filled with Gnostic speeches and prayers.

The work is of interest because of what the author claims to have drawn from the ancient &quot;Acta of the Apostles&quot;, and because of many ancient legends which have survived in this collection. The text of the compiler who may then be called the Pseudo-Abdias may be found in Constantin von Tischendorf, and in the &quot;Codex Apocryphus Novi Testimenti&quot; of Johann Albert Fabricius. There are also parallel texts of single books printed in the Bollandists&#x27; &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;.

<doc id="1141049" wikidata="Q280232" url="?curid=1141049" title="Elizabeth Hubbard">
<text>Elizabeth Hubbard (December 22, 1933 – April 8, 2023) was an American actress, recognized for her role as Althea Davis on the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;The Doctors&quot; (1964–1969, 1970-77, 1981–1982), for which she received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1974, and as businesswoman Lucinda Walsh on the CBS soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1984–2010) for which she received eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations. Hubbard also starred in films such as &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970), &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1979), and &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), and received another Emmy Award for playing former First Lady Edith Wilson in the television film &quot;First Ladies Diaries: Edith Wilson&quot; (1976).

==Early life and education==
Hubbard was born on December 22, 1933, in New York City, to Elizabeth Wright Hubbard and Benjamin Alldritt Hubbard. Her mother, a physician, was a pioneer in homeopathy and one of the first women to earn a medical degree from Columbia University. She had two brothers, Theodore and Merle, an opera talent manager.

Hubbard attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated summa cum laude in 1955. She pursued her theatrical education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, where she was the first American to receive the school&#x27;s silver medal. She graduated from RADA in 1957.

==Acting career==

Hubbard made her Broadway debut as a replacement actress in a revival of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; in 1955. She later performed in 14 Broadway productions, including &quot;The Passion of Josef D.&quot;, &quot;The Physicists&quot; (for which she received the 1965 Clarence Derwent Award for Most Promising Female), &quot;A Time for Singing&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; and &quot;Dance a Little Closer&quot;. Hubbard began her screen career in 1962, starring as Anne Fletcher on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. The following year, she joined the cast of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; as Carol Kramer. In 1964, she inaugurated the role of Dr. Althea Davis on NBC&#x27;s year-old soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;. Hubbard played the role until October 1969, when she left to pursue a career in Hollywood. She returned to the role as of October 1, 1970 and continued the role until 1977. She returned again in 1981 and remained with the show until its cancellation in 1982. In 1974, Hubbard was awarded the first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Hubbard&#x27;s pairing with the character of Dr. Nick Bellini (Gerald Gordon) made them one of the most popular romantic couples in soap operas, dominating the show&#x27;s storyline during the later half of the 1960s and for most of the 1970s.

In 1970, Hubbard made her big screen debut in the Academy Award-nominated drama film &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; opposite Melvyn Douglas and Gene Hackman. In 1976, Hubbard won an additional Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Edith Wilson in the television film &quot;First Ladies Diaries: Edith Wilson&quot;. She also appeared in films &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1979), &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), &quot;Cold River&quot; (1982), &quot;Center Stage&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Treatment&quot; (2006).

After &quot;The Doctors&quot; was cancelled, Hubbard joined the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in the recurring role of society matron Estelle Chadwick. In 1984, she joined &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as businesswoman Lucinda Walsh. She was nominated nine times for a Daytime Emmy for the role. Hubbard left the program in 1999 due to a disagreement over the character&#x27;s direction, but was persuaded to return several months later by the show&#x27;s new executive producer. Hubbard was featured in a prominent storyline in 2005 when her character was diagnosed with cancer. She was in the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary episode in April 2006 and remained with the show until its final episode in September 2010.

In July 2009, she began a recurring role on the Dutch soap opera &quot;Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden&quot; (&quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;), and played the role of Sair Poindexter, an American sexologist and mother of character Irene Huygens, played by Anita Donk. Hubbard, who traveled frequently to the Dutch province of Friesland where her boyfriend resided, was cast after meeting the writers on one of her visits. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; also aired in the Netherlands and Hubbard was already well-known there as a result.

In 2015, Hubbard appeared as Eva Montgomery on the soap opera web series &quot;Anacostia&quot;. She was nominated in 2016 for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a Digital Daytime Drama Series for the role.

==Marriage and child==
Hubbard was married to furrier David Bennett from 1968 to 1973. They had one child, a son, Jeremy Bennett (born September 20, 1971). 

==Death==
Hubbard died of cancer at her home in Roxbury, Connecticut, on April 8, 2023, at the age of 89.

<text>Abdon and Sennen, variously written in early calendars and martyrologies Abdo, Abdus, and Sennes, Sennis, Zennen, are recognized by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church as Christian martyrs, with a feast day on 30 July. In some places they have been honoured on 20 March, and the first Sunday of May.

Nothing is known historically about Abdon and Sennen, and whether they can be verified. The Roman Martyrology indicates that they were martyred for their faith, and suggests they were buried on 30 July in the Cemetery of Pontianus on the Via Portuensis, outside Rome. Their names were subsequently removed in the twentieth century from the list in the General Roman Calendar, which is commemorated liturgically worldwide, but they may still be celebrated everywhere on their feast day unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day. The rank of their celebration was given as &quot;Simple&quot; in the Tridentine calendar and remained such until the classification was changed to that of &quot;Commemoration&quot; in the General Roman Calendar of 1960.

==Veneration==
Their &quot;Acts&quot;, written for the most part prior to the 9th century, describe them as Persian nobles, captured and taken to Rome during a military campaign in the third century. There they became slaves, converted to Christianity and helped bury the Christian dead. They came to the attention of Emperor Decius who had them taken in chains before the Roman Senate, where they refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, and so were dismembered by gladiators in the Colosseum approximately in the year 250. The &quot;Acts&quot; certainly contain several fictitious statements about the cause, the circumstances of their coming to Rome and the nature of their torments. They relate that their bodies were buried by a subdeacon, &quot;Quirinus&quot;, and later transferred in the reign of Constantine the Great (reigned 306–337) to the Cemetery of Pontianus on the road to Porto, near the gates of Rome.

A fresco found on a sixth century sarcophagus supposed to contain their remains represents them receiving crowns from Christ. Several cities, notably Florence and Soissons, claim possession of their bodies, but the Acta Sanctorum insist that they rest in the Basilica of San Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio, Rome, having been brought there in 1474. They may have even had their own church in Rome, which has now been lost. The Benedictine Abbey of Sainte-Marie in Arles-sur-Tech, France also claims their tomb.

Abdon and Sennen are patron saints of Calasparra, in Murcia, Spain. The feasts days celebrated in their honor in this Spanish town date back to the 16th century.

<text>The Clearing is a 2004 American crime thriller film and the directorial debut of film producer Pieter Jan Brugge. The film is loosely based on the real-life kidnapping and murder of Dutch businessman Gerrit Jan Heijn that took place in the Netherlands in 1987. The screenplay was written by Justin Haythe.

==Plot==
Wayne Hayes and his wife Eileen are living the American dream in a wealthy Pittsburgh suburb, having raised two children and built up a successful business from scratch. He is looking forward to a peaceful retirement with Eileen. Everything changes when Wayne is kidnapped in broad daylight by a former employee, Arnold Mack. While Wayne tries negotiating with the kidnapper, Eileen works with the FBI to try to secure her husband&#x27;s release. During the investigation, Eileen learns that Wayne has continued an extramarital affair that he promised to end months previously.

Eileen is eventually instructed to deliver the ransom to the kidnapper, but Arnold takes the money without returning her husband; Arnold murdered Wayne the day of the kidnapping. Eileen&#x27;s ordeal takes place over the course of a week, but the film shows Wayne&#x27;s kidnapping as if it were happening at the same time.

Authorities eventually catch Arnold when he starts spending the ransom money in the neighborhood where he lives. At a local grocery store, he uses a $100 bill for a purchase. The store manager calls to verify the serial number on the $100 bill is on a watch list the FBI distributed to local businesses. During questioning, police ask Arnold if he wanted to be caught, and he admits that the kidnapping was to get money for his depressed wife—but it took him all day to bring himself to kill Wayne and he could not live with the guilt of his crime. In the end, Eileen receives a loving note written by Wayne before his death.

==Cast==
* Robert Redford as Wayne Hayes
* Helen Mirren as Eileen Hayes
* Willem Dafoe as Arnold Mack
* Alessandro Nivola as Tim Hayes
* Matt Craven as FBI Agent Ray Fuller
* Melissa Sagemiller as Jill Hayes
* Wendy Crewson as Louise Miller
* Larry Pine as Tom Finch
* Diana Scarwid as Eva Finch

==Locations==
The film was shot in and around Asheville, North Carolina and in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

== Reception ==
The film has received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though it has an excellent cast, this emotionally detached movie is the kind that one admires more than enjoys.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

According to Roger Ebert, writing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, it &quot;doesn&#x27;t feel bound by the usual formulas of crime movies. What eventually happens will emerge from the personalities of the characters, not from the requirements of Hollywood endings.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;The pleasures of this endeavor, directed with a keen eye for detail by Pieter Jan Brugge, come from what the actors bring to the material.&quot;

Ty Burr, in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, felt that the film had a &quot;lack of emotion&quot; and &quot;could have been more than it is&quot;. M. Torreiro, in the Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, described the film a &quot;tense thriller, cramped and made of downtime and sensations on the limit, a strange film.&quot;

<text>Louis Abelly (1603–1691) was Vicar-General of Bayonne, a parish priest in Paris, and subsequently Bishop of Rodez in 1664.

==Biography==
In 1666, Abelly abdicated and attached himself to Vincent de Paul in the House of St. Lazare, Paris (Lazarists). His ascetical works reveal his deep and sincere piety. He was a bitter foe of the Jansenists, chiefly of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, against whom he directed his &quot;Life of St. Vincent de Paul&quot;, a work which Hurter describes as &quot;full of unction.&quot; 

His &quot;Medulla Theologica&quot; went through many editions, and is characterized by its &quot;solidity, directness, and usefulness.&quot; According to Alphonsus Liguori, Abelly is &quot;a classic in probabilism.&quot; His &quot;Défense de la hiérarchie de l&#x27;Eglise&quot; was directed against an anonymous Gallican writer. He wrote also two s, one for bishops, another for priests; a treatise entitled &quot;De l&#x27;obéissance et soumission due au Pape&quot;; and another called &quot;Traité des Hérésies&quot;. Replying to a Jansenist work known as &quot;Monita Salutaria&quot;, he published his &quot;Sentiments des SS. Pères, touchant les excellences et les prérogatives de la T.S. Vierge&quot;.

<doc id="1141072" wikidata="Q1762366" url="?curid=1141072" title="Inscription of Abercius">
<text>The inscription of Abercius is the Greek epitaph of Abercius who was probably Bishop of Hieropolis in Phrygia. It is an important example of early Christian epigraphy.

==Archeology and context==
In the second half of the 2nd century, Abercius left Hieropolis and visited Rome. Later he travelled through Syria and Mesopotamia, where an ecclesiastical network seems to have already existed. He died back home in Hieropolis after having composed his own epitaph. This text gives an impression of his self-perception and identity as a clergyman. This epitaph may have been a main inspiration for the &quot;Life of Abercius&quot; transmitted in later manuscripts, since the information contained therein can well be explained by the hints contained in the inscription or by common stereotypes for the lifes of saints.

Indeed, the &quot;Life&quot; includes a full transcription of the epitaph. Prior to the late 19th century, scholars such as Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont and Jean Baptiste Francois Pitra tried to prove the authenticity of this transcribed inscription, while Ernest Renan regarded it as completely invented. However, in 1882 the Scottish archaeologist William Mitchell Ramsay discovered at Kelendres, near Synnada, in the Roman province of Phrygia Salutaris (in modern Anatolia), a Christian gravestone dated to the year 300 of the Phrygian era (AD 216). The gravestone belonged to a certain Alexander, son of Anthony. Giovanni Battista de Rossi and Louis Duchesne immediately recognized that the wording corresponded, almost word for word, parts of the epitaph quoted in the &quot;Life of Abercius&quot;. On a second visit to the site of Hieropolis, a year later, Ramsay discovered two fragments of another inscription, built into the public baths. They belonged to another gravestone, but included as well some parts of the epitaph of Abercius as transmitted in the &quot;Life&quot;. These fragments are now in the Vatican Museum.

==Reconstructed epitaph ==
The citizen of a chosen city, this [monument] I made [while] living, that there I might have in time a resting-place of my body, [I] being by name Abercius, the disciple of a holy shepherd who feeds flocks of sheep [both] on mountains and on plains, who has great eyes that see everywhere. For this [shepherd] taught me [that the] book [of life] is worthy of belief. And to Rome he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen golden-robed and golden-sandalled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark. And I saw the land of Syria and all [its] cities; Nisibis [I saw] when I passed over Euphrates. But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul ... Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it [faith] ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread. These things I, Abercius, having been a witness [of them] told to be written here. Verily I was passing through my seventy-second year. He that discerneth these things, every fellow-believer [namely], let him pray for Abercius. And no one shall put another grave over my grave; but if he do, then shall he pay to the treasury of [the] Romans two thousand pieces of gold and to my good native city of Hieropolis one thousand pieces of gold.

==Theories and conclusions==
The interpretation of the Abercius inscription has stimulated animated controversies. In 1894 G. Ficker tried to prove that Abercius was a priest of the mother goddess Cybele, being supported by Otto Hirschfeld. In 1895 Adolf von Harnack tried to explain Abercius as a representative of a religious syncretism. In 1896, Albrecht Dieterich tried to prove that Abercius had been a priest of Attis. These theories were refuted by several archaeologists and theologists such as Armand Abel and Franz Joseph Dölger.

Linguistic and paleographic details show that the epitaph of Abercius is as older than that of Alexander, i.e. prior to the year 216 AD. Abercius himself may be identified with a writer named Avircius Marcellus, mentioned by Eusebius as the author of a work against Montanism. As that treatise was written in the later second cenury AD, the identity of this author with Abercius of Hieropolis is indeed possible.
Abercius was a high clergyman of a little town, the name of which is wrongly given in some sections of the Life, since he belongs to Hieropolis in Phrygia Salutaris, and not to Hierapolis in Phrygia Pacatiensis. Whether the episcopate already existed across the board at the time of Aberkios is disputed. It is therefore unclear whether he himself held this title. The text of the inscription is particularly important regarding the symbolism of the early church. Abercius himself seems to have been proud of his sophisticated formulations and metaphor-rich language, as he emphasises that he wrote the inscription himself.

The middle part of the inscription describes Abercius&#x27; journeys to Rome, Syria and Mesopotamia. The metaphors included in this sentences are not yet fully understood. Whether the &quot;queen golden-robed and golden-sandalled&quot; is a member of the Roman imperial family, refers to the city of Rome itself as the &quot;queen of the world&quot; or is to be interpreted as a metaphor for the Catholic Church is a matter of debate. The &quot;people bearing a shining mark&quot; that Abercius claims to have seen in Rome is generally interpreted as the christian community there, the &quot;mark&quot; (or &quot;seal&quot;) being a common metaphor for the baptism. Regarding his later journeys to Syria and Mesopotamia, Abercius mentions the Apostle Paul as his companion. As the apostle, or rather his writings, became an important authority in the theological debates of the 2nd century, this remark could give an indication of the purpose of the journeys. The vita of the saint suggests as well that Abercius wanted to defend the &quot;true faith&quot; on his travels and take action against Marconism.

The inscription is cited as evidence of the following in second-century Christianity:
# the importance of the church of Rome
# the practice of baptism
# the reception of the Eucharist
# the practice of praying for the dead.

The liturgical cultus of Abercius presents no point of special interest; his name appears for the first time in the Greek menologies and synaxaries of the 10th century, but is not found in the Martyrology of St. Jerome.

<text>John Abercromby (fl. 1561) was, according to Thomas Dempster&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; (1829), a Benedictine monk who was executed for his Roman Catholicism.

<text>Cipitio is a legendary character from Salvadoran folklore revolving around the Siguanaba and cadejo legends. He is generally portrayed as an 8- to 10-year-old boy with a large conical hat and a pot-belly. His name is taken from the Nahuatl word for child: or . Some also relate his name to the deity Xipe Totec.

According to the legend, he is the product of a forbidden romance between Sihuehuet, goddess of the moon, commonly known as La Siguanaba, and Lucero de la mañana (Lucifer). When Sihuehuet&#x27;s husband found out about this affair, he sought the assistance of the god Teotl. Both the queen and Cipitio were cursed and condemned by Teotl. Cipitio was condemned to live eternity as a small boy with his feet set in a backwards position to serve as reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents. Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy. They decide to follow them but eventually get lost because unbeknownst to them Cipitio has backwards feet and so they head in the wrong direction into the bush.

Cipitio is said to enjoy eating ashes, throwing pebbles at beautiful ladies, and preferring to eat a variety of banana called . He can also teleport anywhere he wants.

A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book &quot;Cuentos de Cipotes&quot; by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador Salarrué.

He is the main protagonist on a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station and is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role since the show&#x27;s beginning. Each episode depicts the problems that Salvadoran children encounter in their communities, families, and schools. Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

These dimensions are about twice as large as those of a typical brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), which suggests about eight times the body mass.

The body mass has been estimated at , comparable to a rabbit.

&quot;Papagomys armandvillei&quot; is the only extant species in the genus &quot;Papagomys,&quot; with another smaller species, &quot;Papagomys theodorverhoeveni&quot;, known from subfossil remains. The specific epithet, armandvillei, honours the Dutch Jesuit missionary Cornelis J. F. le Cocq d&#x27;Armandville (1846–1896) who was stationed in the Dutch East Indies, and later in New Guinea.

Guy Musser describes the Flores giant rat as having small, round ears, a chunky body, and a small tail, and as appearing to be adapted for life on the ground with refuge in burrows. It has dense dark hair (pelage). Analysis of the teeth suggests a diet of leaves, buds, fruit, and certain kinds of insects as inferred by large hypsodont teeth.

The Flores giant rat has been suggested to have been a prey item of the extinct dwarf human species &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;.

==Conservation==
&quot;P. armandvillei&quot; is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. Threats include subsistence hunting and predation by dogs and cats.

<text>The São Paulo Art Biennial (Portuguese: &quot;Bienal de São Paulo&quot;) was founded in 1951 and has been held every two years since. It is the second oldest art biennial in the world after the Venice Biennale (in existence since 1895), which serves as its role model.

== History ==

The Biennial was founded by the Italian-Brazilian industrialist Ciccillo Matarazzo (1898–1977). Since 1957, the São Paulo Biennial has been held in the Ciccillo Matarazzo pavilion in the Parque do Ibirapuera. The three-story pavilion was designed by a team led by architects Oscar Niemeyer and Hélio Uchôa, and provides an exhibition space of 30,000 m2. The São Paulo Bienal features Brazilian and international contemporary art and is one of South America&#x27;s most important large-scale art exhibitions.

After the completion of the 6th Biennial, the São Paulo Biennial Foundation was created to advance the exhibition, which until then had been organized by the Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo (MAM-SP). The pavilion the institution occupies - its home to this day - only began holding the Bienal exhibitions starting with its 4th edition in 1957. 

Since 1951, 32 Bienals have been produced with the participation of 170 countries, more than 16 thousand artists and almost 10 million visitors, making direct contact possible between the Brazilian public and visual, theatrical and graphic arts, music, film, architecture, and other forms of artistic expression from around the world. The 1998 edition cost almost $12 million and drew nearly 400,000 visitors during a two-month run. The 25th biennial was originally scheduled for 2000 but was delayed to 2002 after a gigantic exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of Brazil&#x27;s discovery by the Portuguese was organized by former biennial president Edemar Cid Ferreira and booked into the Ciccillo Matarazzo pavilion. That year, for the first time, the chief curator of the biennial was a foreigner, Alfons Hug from Germany.

The biennial&#x27;s initial aim was to make contemporary art (primarily from Western Europe and the United States) known in Brazil, push the country&#x27;s access to the current art scene in other metropolises, and establish São Paulo itself as an international art center. Naturally, the biennial always serves to bring Brazilian art closer to foreign guests.

== Artists, works and countries ==
== Highlights year by year ==
=== 1st Bienal, 1951 ===
The first Bienal was held by the Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo (MAM-SP) in a temporary pavilion located on the Belvedere Trianon, in the neighborhood along Paulista Avenue. Abraham Palatnik’s first &quot;Aparelho cinecromático&quot; (1949) was initially rejected by the selection committee on the grounds that it did not fit any of the established categories, though the work was later accepted and awarded an honorable mention by the international jury.

=== 2nd Bienal, 1953 ===
Known as the “Guernica Bienal”, in reference to Pablo Picasso’s 1937 masterpiece, the 2nd Bienal is by far one of the most memorable editions of the event. Exhibiting twice as many artworks as the first edition, the 2nd Bienal was held at two pavilions designed for the newly inaugurated Ibirapuera Park by Oscar Niemeyer (1917-2012): the States Pavilion (presently the Pavilion of Brazilian Cultures) and the Nations Pavilion (now home to the Afro Brasil Museum). The exhibition continued into the following year as part of the celebrations for São Paulo&#x27;s 400th anniversary.

=== 3rd Bienal, 1955 ===
Having established itself as an important event in international art world, the Bienal&#x27;s 3rd edition featured the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.

=== 4th Bienal, 1957 ===
In the 4th Bienal, many Brazilian artists contested the selection process and Ciccillo Matarazzo&#x27;s inordinate influence. This was the first time the Bienal was held at its present home, the Industry Pavilion at Ibirapuera Park. This edition was surrounded by controversy when works by several leading names in the Brazilian art scene, such as Flávio de Carvalho, were turned down by the selection jury. The abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock, who died the year before, was honoured with a special room organized by the American delegation, which marked the height of his international renown.

=== 5th Bienal, 1959 ===
200,000 visitors ensured the success of this exhibition, whose highlights included a selection of thirty works by the impressionist icon, Vincent van Gogh, and a strong showing of Tachism and Informal Art.

=== 6th Bienal, 1961 ===
Ciccillo Matarazzo ceases to be the main patron of the Bienal and the exhibition endured its first financial crisis. The 6th edition is remembered for its museology and the predominance of Neoconcretism, typified by the revolutionary presence of Lygia Clark’s &quot;Bichos&quot;. Furthermore, part of the selection committee was elected by artists. The Bienal received a delegation from the USSR for the first time in the event’s history.

=== 7th Bienal, 1963 ===
The 7th edition was marked by an excessive number of works selected, which, in turn, created an eclectic scene that was difficult to understand. This was the first time that Fundação Bienal (founded in 1962) organized the exhibition, instead of the Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo. The catalog was dedicated to Wanda Svevo, who died the previous year.

=== 8th Bienal, 1965 ===
The Bienal comes under political pressure from the government with the beginning of the military dictatorship in Brazil. At the awards ceremony, artists Maria Bonomi and Sérgio Camargo deliver a motion for the repeal of the preventive arrests of Mário Schenberg, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Florestan Fernandes and Cruz Costa to the President Castelo Branco. Despite the complications, the exhibition is remembered for a special room dedicated to Surrealism and Fantastic art. Marcel Duchamp’s famous ready-made &quot;Roue de bicyclette&quot; (1913) was shown alongside works by Max Ernst, Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, Jean Arp, Man Ray, Paul Klee, Paul Delvaux, René Magritte and Francis Picabia.

=== 9th Bienal, 1967 ===
The “Pop Art Bienal” opened under a shroud of controversy: even before the exhibition opened, the Federal Police removed two works on the grounds that they were “offensive” to the Brazilian Constitution: Cybèle Varela’s painting &quot;O presente&quot; was considered “anti-nationalist” – the work was destroyed and the artist almost arrested by the DOPS – and the series by Quissak Jr., &quot;Meditação sobre a Bandeira Nacional&quot;, which infringed laws that prohibited the free use of the flag. The US delegation presented a sample of Pop Art that included Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg. Many works were damaged and the US room was vandalized a few days into the exhibition. From this show on, the award jury was composed of art critics rather than consultants.

=== 10th Bienal, 1969 ===
Months after Institutional Act n. 5 (AI-5) came into force, effectively annulling personal freedoms, eighty percent of the artists invited to exhibition refused, in protest, to participate. The 10th edition was thus nicknamed the “Boycott Bienal”

=== 11th Bienal, 1971 ===
Controversy surrounded the opening of the Bienal with the boycott by artists, again, and the exile of Mario Pedrosa, who had been a leader for most of the editions in the Bienal&#x27;s first decade, and director of the 6th and 7th editions. The selection of Brazilian artists was made from a pre-Bienal held the previous year.

=== 12th Bienal, 1973 ===
A giant mouth designed by Vera Figueiredo &quot;swallowed&quot; visitors to 12th Bienal, demonstrating the strength of Neo-concrete derivations. Installations and environments that appealed to all of the senses were presented in the Art and Communication segment. Replacing the Art Technical Committee, the Council for Art and Culture (CAC) developed a new selection framework and denied entry to 90% of the Brazilian works submitted. The Brazilian Representation was made up of 100 artists selected through regional juries (Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Curitiba). Kandinsky&#x27;s works, which were brought by the French Representation, are exhibited for the first time in South America.

=== 13th Bienal, 1975 ===
Eager for updating, the so-called &quot;Videomakers Bienal&quot; brought Brazil a precise selection video art produced by renowned artists from all parts of the world, ranging from Andy Warhol to South Korean Nam June Paik, whose installation &quot;TV Garden&quot; (1974) surprised the Brazilian audience by arranging TV monitors among vases of Palm trees and artificial plants.

=== 14th Bienal, 1977 ===
The first Bienal without Ciccillo was defined by meaningful changes: the appointment of a Council for Art and Culture with freedom to develop the exhibition program – among the new rules is the requirement that National Representations follow the themes proposed by the Bienal for the selection of artists, a model inspired by the Venice Biennale. The CAC defines three chapters for the exhibition: Anthological Exhibitions (replacing the Special Rooms), Great Confrontations and Contemporary Propositions – the latter composed of seven themes: Urban Archaeology, Nature Recuperation, Catastrophic Art, Video Art, Space Poetry, The Wall as a Display for Artworks, Non Codified Art. For the first time in its history, the Grand Prize &quot;Itamaraty&quot; was awarded to a Latin American artist, the Argentine Grupo CAYC of the Centro de Arte y Comunicación in Buenos Aires. 

=== 15th Bienal, 1979 ===
The &quot;Bienal of the Bienals&quot; was a retrospective of the previous fourteen editions and brought national and international prize-winning works since 1951 back to the pavilion, as well as artists selected by the Brazilian Association of Art Critics (ABCA). On the other hand, it was the first Bienal not to grant any awards, a strategy that would continue on definitively in the following editions.

=== 16th Bienal, 1981 ===
The emergence of the General Curator role would change the course of the Bienal. The critic and former Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art of the University of São Paulo (MAC-USP), Walter Zanini, was the first to fill the position, in an edition which abolished separate spaces for each country and chose to group the works according to &quot;analogy of language&quot; (techniques and themes). This show also marks the end of the boycotts of the Bienal by artists and the beginning of political openness in Brazil.

=== 17th Bienal, 1983 ===
The increasingly common languages in contemporary global art of performance, video, videotext, installation and happening set the tone of the 17th Bienal. Fluxus Street was installed on the ground floor of the pavilion and was one of the most memorable installations. It even included a room with documentation on the group – records of Ben Vautier sleeping, Dick Higgins playing the piano, and Wolf Vostell during an action in New York.

=== 18th Bienal, 1985 ===
This edition showed the rising trend of expressionism in contemporary painting and featured an unusual expography that set the debate through the course of the entire 18th Bienal. The curator, Sheila Leirner, arranged most of the works in three 100-meter long halls, installing paintings side by side – a display called the Great Canvas.

=== 19th Bienal, 1987 ===
Adopting “Utopia versus Reality” as its theme, the 19th Bienal&#x27;s highlights were the works by German artist Anselm Kiefer. Marked by a strong presence of installations and sculptures, the third floor of the pavilion received the monumental sculpture, &quot;Palette mit Flügel&quot; (1985), by Kiefer, and the installation &quot;Enquanto flora a borda...&quot; (1987), by Tunga, which would slide from the ceiling to the floor in the large central span of the pavilion.

=== 20th Bienal, 1989 ===
The 20th Bienal was conceived by a triumvirate: Carlos von Schmidt, Stella Teixeira de Barros, and João Cândido Galvão. Interrupting the propositions of past editions, the team resumed the granting of awards and the arrangement of national representations in separate rooms. The Brazilian Representation was considered to be one of the most solid in a long time.

=== 21st Bienal, 1991 ===
Only for this edition did the Bienal resume the system of open registration for artists from all over the world. Heading the curatorship, João Cândido Galvão repeated his role in the previous edition as curator of the dance, music and theater sections, and enjoyed success by presenting two unforgettable performances: &quot;Suz/O/Suz&quot;, by the Catalan group Fura dels Baus, and &quot;O Trilogie Antica: Medeea, Troienele, Electra&quot;, by Henrik Ibsen, narrated in Latin and Greek by the National Theater Company of Bucharest.

=== 22nd Bienal, 1994 ===
The Bienal changes its calendar and starts taking place in even-numbered years. The historical segment takes on a major importance in this edition, whose theme, “Rupture as Support,” made it possible to explore platforms and poetics observed in the works of Hélio Oiticica, Lygia Clark and Mira Schendel.

=== 23rd Bienal, 1996 ===
A new record in the number of national representations with 75 countries subscribing to the theme proposed by Nelson Aguilar: “The Dematerialization of Art at the End of the Millennium.” On this occasion, a Historical Nucleus with a broad diversity of countries brought together over 200 prints by Francisco de Goya, illustrated the posthumous work of Jean-Michael Basquiat, and presented 37 paintings by Edvard Munch.

=== 24th Bienal, 1998 ===
Known as one of the best editions ever produced, the &quot;Anthropophagy Bienal&quot; was led by Paulo Herkenhoff as general curator and Adriano Pedrosa as associate curator. The concept, extracted from the roots of Brazilian culture, permeated the work of all 76 curators involved in the exhibition, as well as was the result of powerful solo shows dedicated to each of the 53 National Representations. The curators worked with the idea of contamination and put contemporary Brazilian works in dialogue with works in the Historical Nucleus.

The 1998 bienial was specifically acclaimes a new perspective on art history through a Brazilian lens. It introduced a novel curatorial approach relevant to the era of post-colonial globalization. The exhibition utilized the Brazilian concept of anthropophagy as both a theoretical framework and practical methodology. This approach encouraged the &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;cannibalization&quot; of established art historical narratives, alongside a broader understanding of the exhibition&#x27;s educational role in integrating art, culture, and political history.

=== 25th Bienal, 2002 ===
Centered on the theme “Metropolitan Iconographies”, the 25th Bienal has become famous for the strong presence of Brazilian artists off the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro axis. The appointment of the first foreign curator, Alfons Hug, from Germany, excited controversy. However, the show received excellent acclaim and beat attendance records, at 668,428 visitors.

==== Taiwan controversy ====

During the event, the title of Taiwan&#x27;s national pavilion was changed overnight read &quot;Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei&quot;. This was revealed to had been caused by the Chinese government, who had threatened to pull their own artists out of the event. In protest Chien-Chi Chang, the artist chosen to represent Taiwan at the Biennial, closed their installation. Austrian group Monochrom, who were running the neighbouring pavilion, invited other artists to donate letters from their own country titles in order to recreate the word &quot;Taiwan&quot;. Although they were successful, this too was taken down.

=== 26th Bienal, 2004 ===
This was the first year of the free admission policy, which would be applied to all subsequent editions. With the theme of “Free Territory,” the 26th Bienal, introduced a new generation into the art scene, such as Cabelo, Chelpa Ferro and Laura Vinci, among others. Once again the exhibition demonstrated its highly contemporary character by presenting works mostly produced between 2002 and 2004. At least one third of the works in the show were site-specific projects, developed specifically for the Bienal Pavilion.
=== 27th Bienal, 2006 ===
The theme “How to Live Together” – the title of a set of seminars delivered by Roland Barthes in the 1970s – served curator Lisette Lagnado as a guide. The edition was marked by the extinction of National Representations – the selection of artists was up to the determination of the curators of the Bienals – and by the claim that art is a transnational language. Constituting a fundamental innovation for the exhibition, the curatorial projects would be chosen from then on through a selection process conducted by an international committee of critics and curators.

=== 28th Bienal, 2008 ===
Rethinking the purpose and direction of the exhibition, the 28th Bienal – “In Living Contact” carried out a radical proposal by keeping the second floor of the pavilion completely empty, as an Open Plan – a metaphor for the conceptual crisis experienced by traditional biennial systems faced by the institutions that organize them. The noteworthy episode of that edition was the graffiti on the pavilion&#x27;s guardrails, which led to a discussion in the art milieu about urban art.

=== 29th Bienal, 2010 ===
Driven by a new impetus promoted by a new board of directors committed to the renewal of the institution, the Bienal inaugurated its 29th edition with a permanent educational project and a broad parallel program. Favoring politically oriented works, the curatorship of Agnaldo Farias and Moacir dos Anjos held nearly 400 activities in the six conceptual spaces entitled Terreiros, and made its theme a verse by Jorge de Lima: “There is always a cup of sea to sail in”. &quot;Bandeira branca&quot; (2010), by Nuno Ramos, stirred controversy due to its live vultures flying in the central span of the pavilion accompanied by a montage of sounds from the national popular tradition.

=== 30th Bienal, 2012 ===
Titled “The Imminence of Poetics”, this edition of the Bienal adopted the constellation as a metaphor and established discursive interconnections between past and present; center and periphery; object and language. With a large number of works by each artist, the exhibition focused on Latin American artists and paid tribute to Arthur Bispo do Rosário and Waldemar Cordeiro. The project Mobile Radio set up a radio station on the mezzanine floor of the pavilion that had broadcasts throughout the entire period of the exhibition. The Biennial featured the largest corpus of works by Alair Gomes ever shown, the entire portfolio People of the XXth Century by August Sander and for the first time in the Americas the entire Alphabet Bété by Frédéric Bruly-Bouabré, among 119 artists represented within the Matarazzo Pavilion and other institutions throughout the city of São Paulo. 

=== 31st Bienal, 2014 ===
The works of this edition – entitled “How to (…) things that don’t exist” – were designed within the concept of &quot;project,&quot; many carried out in collaboration between two or more individuals – artists and professionals from other disciplines, such as teachers, sociologists, architects or writers. Daring, the exhibition established itself as being deeply connected with some central themes of contemporary life: identity, sexuality and transcendence.

=== 32nd Bienal, 2016 ===
The 32nd Bienal – “Live Uncertainty” set itself the aim of observing notions of uncertainty and strategies offered by contemporary art to embrace or inhabit it. Established artists like Öyvind Fahlström, Sonia Andrade, Lourdes Castro and Víctor Grippo were seen alongside young artists, most of whom were women. Also noteworthy is the fact that this edition was the one that presented the highest number of commissioned artworks in the history of the exhibition. The curators traveled to four cities to bring forth Study Days (Accra, in Ghana, Lamas, in Peru, Santiago, in Chile, and Cuiabá, in Brazil), and also held a last meeting in São Paulo. Conceived as an artwork by Jorge Menna Barreto, the exhibition&#x27;s restaurant unfolds notions regarding the relationships between human eating habits and the environment, landscape, climate and life on Earth.

=== 33rd Bienal, 2018 ===
The 33rd Bienal – “Affective Affinities” was held from September 7 to December 9. According to the general curator, Gabriel Pérez-Barreiro, this theme was inspired by both the novel Elective Affinities by Johann Wolfgang Goethe and the thesis of Brazilian art critic Mário Pedrosa titled &quot;On the Affective Nature of Form in the Work of Art.&quot; The curatorial model was changed to include seven artists, with each curating their own exhibition.

=== 34th Bienal, 2020/2021 ===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most events for this year were postponed to September 4 through December 5, 2021, with future Bienales to be held in odd-numbered years. The theme was &quot;Though it’s dark, still I sing&quot;, reflecting the turbulent events of the time, from Amazon forest fires to the economic crisis and the pandemic.

=== 35th Bienal, 2023 ===
The 2023 São Paulo Bienal – titled &quot;Choreographies of the Impossible&quot; – sought to address and question activism, repressed cultures, and the art history of South America. Focusing on the history and consequence of colonialism and oppression, the majority of participating artists hailed from Africa, Asia and South America. To signal this break with tradition and hierarchy, the curatorial team was composed of four curators with no chief curator.

=== 36th Bienal, 2025 ===
The upcoming 2025 São Paulo Biennial, titled &quot;Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice&quot;, is set to extend the traditionally month-long event by an additional 4 weeks.

<text>The 15 cm sIG 33 (schweres Infanteriegeschütz 33, lit. &quot;heavy infantry gun&quot;) was the standard German heavy infantry gun used during Second World War. It was the largest weapon ever classified as an infantry gun by any nation.

Its weight made it difficult to use in the field, and the gun was increasingly adapted to various &quot;ad hoc&quot; mobile mounting, which were generically referred to as the SIG 33.

== Development ==
Sources differ on the development history, but the gun itself was of conventional design. Early production models were horse-drawn, with wooden wheels. Later production models had pressed steel wheels, with solid rubber tires and air brakes for motor towing, albeit at a low speed (only carriages with pneumatic tires and suspension system could be towed at highway speeds). As with most German artillery carriages, the solid rubber tires and lack of springing meant that the gun could not safely be towed above 10 mph, and horse-drawing was still extensively employed.

The sIG 33 was rather heavy for its mission, and it was redesigned in the late 1930s to incorporate light alloys. This saved about , the outbreak of war forced the return to the original design before more than a few hundred were made, as the Luftwaffe had a higher priority for light alloys. A new carriage, made entirely of light alloys, was tested around 1939, but was not accepted for service.

== Ammunition ==
Most of the shells used by the sIG 33 were unexceptional in design. The &quot;Stielgranate 42&quot; was an exception. The finned projectile was mounted in front of and outside the barrel on a muzzle-loaded driving rod, and fired with a special propellant charge. The projectile had a range of about a , with the rod separating at about . The &quot;Stielgranate 42&quot; was designed for demolition and obstacle clearance, unlike the previous anti-tank &quot;Stielgranate 41&quot;.

<text>Arthur Barclay (31 July 1854 – 10 July 1938) was the 15th president of Liberia from 1904 to 1912.

==Early life and education==
Barclay was born at Bridgetown, Barbados, on 31 July 1854, the tenth of twelve children of Anthony and Sarah Barclay. He was the father of Anthony Barclay, who served on the Supreme Court of Liberia, and uncle of the 18th president, Edwin Barclay.

Barclay immigrated to Liberia with his father in 1865. His first teacher was his oldest sister, Antoinette Barclay. He later entered the Preparatory Department of Liberia College, under the principalship of Anthony T. Ferguson. Having completed the course prescribed, he matriculated into the Collegiate Department and graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in the Class of 1873.

==Career==

In 1877, he was appointed principal of the Preparatory Department of his alma mater, which position he held for a number of years, and served during the vacation as chief clerk of the House of Representatives. His later services to the said institution were: professor, member of the board of trustees, and sometimes acting president.

He was called to the bar of Montserrado County in 1877, and after practicing law for three years, he attained the rank of counsellor of the Supreme Court.

His first official position was private secretary to President Joseph Jenkins Roberts in 1874. His second position was judge of the Court of Quarter Sessions and Common Pleas of Montserrado County to which he was appointed by President Alfred F. Russell in 1883.

In 1885, President Hilary R. W. Johnson appointed him sub-treasurer of Montserrado County, which he held for 5 years.

He was mayor of Monrovia from 1892 to 1902.

In 1892, President Joseph James Cheeseman elevated him to the cabinet position as postmaster-general and then to secretary of state. Upon the death of his predecessor H. A. Williams in 1896, he was appointed secretary of the treasury, which he held until his election to the presidency in May 1903. Inaugurated in January 1904, he served until January 1912. After his retirement served as president of Liberia College from 1914 to 1917.

He served upon the following diplomatic commissions:
* In 1893, associated with Senator A. B. King, and William Rothery, he was sent as a commissioner to the World&#x27;s Fair at Chicago, Illinois, United States.
* In 1897, associated with Attorney General Stevens, he went to London, England, to arrange with the Council of Foreign Bondholders for the amortization of the loan of 1870, contracted in the administration of President Edward James Roye, which had been in default for over 20 years.
* In 1901, he was associated with Chief Justice Z. B. Roberts and Senator A. B. King on diplomatic missions to England and France.

==Presidency (1904–1912)==

Arthur Barclay was president from 1904 to 1912. In addition to continued internal unrest, the country faced a severe economic crisis and huge indebtedness to European creditors. In the decades after 1868, escalating economic difficulties weakened the state&#x27;s dominance over the coastal indigenous population. Conditions worsened, as the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. Liberia tried desperately to modernize its largely agricultural economy.

In 1907, while president of the nation, he headed the mission to arrange boundary disputes with the British and French Governments, associating with F. E. R. Johnson, secretary of state, and T. McCants Stewart, Deputy Attorney-General of Liberia.

George Washington Ellis wrote of Barclay in 1911,He brought with his elevation to the presidency a deep thinker, a wide public experience and equipment, a gentleman of modest and retiring manners, a faithful public servant and a brave champion of public measures. He surrounded himself with the ablest men of his country and his administrations will be remembered for many notable civic triumphs in behalf of the Liberian state: the definition of Liberian boundaries, the pacification of the interior, increased control of the native races, organization of the Liberian Frontier Police Force, better supervision of the Liberian customs, and repeated attempts at judicial and other domestic reformsUnder his government, the Liberian Frontier Force was created, which later evolved into the Liberian Armed Forces.

==Death==
He died at his home in Monrovia on 10 July 1938.

<text>In mathematics, the Siegel upper half-space of degree &quot;g (orgenus &quot;g) (also called the Siegel upper half-plane) is the set of &quot;g&quot; × &quot;g&quot; symmetric matrices over the complex numbers whose imaginary part is positive definite. It was introduced by . It is the symmetric space associated to the symplectic group .

The Siegel upper half-space has properties as a complex manifold that generalize the properties of the upper half-plane, which is the Siegel upper half-space in the special case &quot;g&quot; = 1. The group of automorphisms preserving the complex structure of the manifold is isomorphic to the symplectic group . Just as the two-dimensional hyperbolic metric is the unique (up to scaling) metric on the upper half-plane whose isometry group is the complex automorphism group = , the Siegel upper half-space has only one metric up to scaling whose isometry group is . Writing a generic matrix &quot;Z&quot; in the Siegel upper half-space in terms of its real and imaginary parts as &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;X&quot; + &quot;iY&quot;, all metrics with isometry group are proportional to
:formula_1

The Siegel upper half-plane can be identified with the set of tame almost complex structures compatible with a symplectic structure formula_2, on the underlying formula_3 dimensional real vector space formula_4, that is, the set of formula_5 such that formula_6 and formula_7 for all vectors formula_8.

As a symmetric space of non-compact type, the Siegel upper half space formula_9 is the quotient
:formula_10
where we used that formula_11 is the maximal torus.
Since the isometry group of a symmetric space formula_12 is formula_13, we recover that the isometry group of formula_9 is formula_15. An isometry acts via a generalized Möbius transformation
:formula_16
The quotient space formula_17 is the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension formula_18.

<text>Maultier (English: &quot;mule&quot;) or [[Sd.Kfz.]] 3 is the name given to series of half-track trucks used by Nazi Germany during World War II. They were based on Opel, Mercedes-Benz, Alfa Romeo or Ford trucks.

==History==
Soon after invading the USSR, German troops discovered that their wheeled transport vehicles were unsuitable for the sparse road network, particularly in the muddy conditions of the &quot;rasputitsa&quot;. Only half tracks like the Sd.Kfz. 11 could haul supplies to forward units in these conditions, but removing them from their combat role for supply duties was not feasible, so it was decided to produce half-tracked versions of standard Opel, Daimler-Benz, Alfa-Romeo and Ford trucks (lorries) by removing their rear axles, truncating the prop-shafts and connecting them to redundant Panzer I track assemblies. Heavier trucks (4 tons payload) were fitted with Panzer II track assemblies.

Horstmann suspension components employed by the Panzer I was practically identical to the light tank track system used on the Universal Carrier, with the Maultier&#x27;s use of them closely resembling the roadwheel/suspension system used by the T16 American-produced version in its roadwheel design. Most Maultier conversions were based on Opel Blitz model S trucks, which proved successful in service.

Although they lacked the overall mobility of purpose-built half tracks, they were cheaper and sufficiently effective. From 1943 some Maultier trucks were fitted with armored bodies, designated Sd.Kfz. 4. Some of these were armed with ten-tube rocket launcher Panzerwerfer 42, and were designated Sd.Kfz.. 4/1.

== Production ==
The vehicles were built by Opel at the Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG and also in France in the Ford factory in Asnieres. In 1942 a total of 635 vehicles were produced, 1943 there were 13,000 and 1944 only 7,310.

<text>Katie Hafner (born December 5, 1957) is an American journalist and author. She is a former staff member of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and has written articles and books on subjects including technology and history. She co-produces and hosts the podcast series &quot;Lost Women of Science&quot;. Her first novel, &quot;The Boys&quot;, was published in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Hafner was born in Rochester, New York, and raised in Amherst, Massachusetts. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in German literature from the University of California at San Diego in 1979 and a master&#x27;s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1981.

==Career==
Beginning in 1983, Hafner worked as a reporter at &quot;Computerworld&quot; and then at &quot;The San Diego Union&quot;. She became a staff editor at &quot;Business Week&quot; in 1986, leaving in 1989. From 1990 to 1994, she worked freelance, writing articles and books, before becoming technology correspondent at &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In February 1998 she became a writer for the weekly &quot;Circuits&quot; section of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where she remained on staff for a decade. She has also written for &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;The Golfer’s Journal&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

Hafner&#x27;s first book was &quot;Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier&quot; (1991), an exploration of youth computer-hacking in three parts, co-written with John Markoff. In 1996, with her then husband, Matthew Lyon, she published &quot;Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet&quot;. This was one of the earliest in-depth and comprehensive histories of the ARPANET and how it led to the Internet. It explored the &quot;human dimension&quot; of the development of the ARPANET covering the &quot;theorists, computer programmers, electronic engineers, and computer gurus who had the foresight and determination to pursue their ideas and affect the future of technology and society&quot;. Her 2001 book on the online community The WELL, an expansion of a 1997 article for &quot;Wired&quot;, was praised there for &quot;flashes of genuine insight&quot;. Her sixth book, &quot;Mother Daughter Me&quot; (2013), a memoir about trying to live with her mother and her teenage daughter in a house in San Francisco, was named one of &quot;Ten Titles to Pick Up Now&quot; in the August 2013 issue of &quot;O Magazine&quot; and was on other lists of recommendations including &quot;Parade&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Summer Reading List&quot;.

Her first novel, &quot;The Boys&quot;, was published in July 2022, the first novel to be published by the relaunched Spiegel &amp; Grau.

Hafner&#x27;s 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;Growing Wikipedia Refines its &#x27;Anyone Can Edit&#x27; Policy&quot; is included in the second edition of &quot;The McGraw-Hill Guide Writing for College, Writing for Life&quot;, an English composition textbook.

She is on the advisory board of the Internet Hall of Fame. She is interviewed in the John Korty documentary &quot;Miracle in a Box&quot;, about the rebuilding of a Steinway piano.

Hafner is co-executive producer and host of the podcast series &quot;Lost Women of Science&quot;. The first season tells the story of Dr. Dorothy Andersen, the first person to identify and describe cystic fibrosis. The second season is the story of Klára Dán von Neumann, one of the first women to work as a computer programmer. The third season is about Yvonne Young Clark, the first woman to earn a degree in mechanical engineering from Howard University and the first Black member of the Society of Women Engineers.

==Personal life==
Hafner&#x27;s first husband was John Markoff. They divorced and she married Matthew Lyon, a university administrator, in 1992; they had a daughter. He died in February 2002. In 2012 she remarried to Robert M. Wachter, who is chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. In June 2022, he announced that she probably had long COVID. In March 2023 she participated in an hour-long vodcast with Roy Wood Jr. on the Matilda effect.

<doc id="1141122" wikidata="Q163506" url="?curid=1141122" title="Sd.Kfz. 250">
<text>The Sd.Kfz. 250 (German: &quot;Sonderkraftfahrzeug&quot; 250; &#x27;special motor vehicle&#x27;) was a light armoured half-track, very similar in appearance to the larger Hanomag-designed Sd.Kfz. 251, and built by the DEMAG firm, for use by Nazi Germany in World War II. Most variants were open-topped and had a single access door in the rear.

The Sd. Kfz 250 was adopted in 1939 to supplement the standard half-track. Production delays meant that the first vehicle did not appear until mid-1941.

==Development==
In 1939, the Inspectorate for Motorised Troops (AHA/In 6) decided that it would be useful for armoured half-tracks to accompany tanks in the attack. These could meet the requirements for smaller vehicles to be used in the headquarters, artillery observer, radio, and reconnaissance roles.

Demag, the designer of the smallest half-track in service, the Sd.Kfz. 10, was selected to develop the &quot;light armoured troop carrier&quot; (&quot;leichter gepanzerter Mannschafts-Transportwagen&quot;) or Sd.Kfz. 250.

To this end, the Sd.Kfz. 10 hull was shortened by one road wheel station, and an armoured hull (&quot;Panzerwanne&quot;) constructed around the truncated running gear.

While intended as a derivative of a standard inventory item, eventually virtually every component was redesigned and specific to the Sd.Kfz. 250.

==Description==
Power for the &quot;Sd.Kfz. 250&quot; was provided by a Maybach 6-cylinder, water-cooled, 4.17-litre (254 cu in) &quot;HL 42 TRKM&quot; gasoline engine of . It had a semi-automatic pre-selector transmission with seven forward and three reverse gears: Maybach SRG, type &quot;VG 102 128 H&quot;, (SRG=Schaltreglergetriebe, VG=Variorex-Getriebe, H=Hohlachse).

Gears were first selected and then the change pedal depressed to change the ratio, the next gear could then be selected in advance. It could attain , but the driver was cautioned not to exceed .

Both tracks and wheels were used for steering. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would be applied to the tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The Sd.Kfz. 250 also inherited the track-sparing but more complicated rollers in place of the more commonplace toothed sprockets.

The track ran on four double roadwheels overlapping and interleaved in the so-called &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; design used by nearly all German half-tracked vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars, track tension being maintained by an idler wheel, mounted at the rear.

The front wheels had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers (the only ones fitted) to dampen impacts.

The &quot;Sd.Kfz. 250&quot; (and its parent, the Sd.Kfz. 10) were unique among German half-track designs as they used a hull rather than a frame or chassis.

===Armour===
==Service history==

The vehicle was used in a wide variety of roles throughout World War II. The basic troop carrier version was used as an armoured personnel carrier for reconnaissance units, carrying scout sections. This basic variant usually mounted one or two MG34 machineguns. Later variants carried 20 mm, 37 mm, and even 75 mm guns to support the more lightly armed versions (see table below).

Several special-purpose variants were seen early in the war. The 250/3 and 250/5 were command variants, with fewer seats but equipped with long-range radio equipment. These were used by battalion and higher commanders as personal command vehicles, most famously the 250/3 used by Erwin Rommel in the North African campaign. Early versions had large &#x27;bedframe&#x27; antennas, which were easy to spot at long range, making them more vulnerable to artillery fire. Later variants dispensed with this and instead used the far less conspicuous whip antenna.

The &quot;Sd.Kfz&quot;. 253 variant was fully enclosed, and was used by artillery observers to accompany tank and mechanized infantry units.

The initial design had a multi-faceted armoured body constructed from multiple plates, which gave good protection against small arms fire but was both slow and costly to manufacture, and resulted in a cramped interior.

Production of this early version stopped in October 1943 with some 4,200 built and the complex body-shape dropped in favour of a &quot;neue art&quot; (new version) with flattened crew compartment sides made from a single piece of armour. This greatly simplified manufacture but in both variants the level of protection was minimal - rifle-calibre small-arms fire and shell fragments would likely be stopped, but heavy machine guns, anti-tank rifles and virtually any form of artillery could perforate the Sd.Kfz. 250 even at long range.

In August 1943, Romania acquired a total of 27 armoured half-tracks, of both the &quot;251&quot; and &quot;250&quot; types. Sd.Kfz. 251s were known as &quot;SPW mijlociu&quot; (&quot;medium SPW&quot;) in Romanian service, while Sd.Kfz. 250s were referred to as &quot;SPW ușor&quot; (&quot;light SPW&quot;).

<text>The Sd.Kfz. 6 (&quot;Sonderkraftfahrzeug&quot; 6) was a half-track military vehicle used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was designed to be used as the main towing vehicle for the 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer.

== Development ==
Development of a new medium artillery tractor began in 1934 at Büssing-NAG, in Berlin. The vehicle, produced in around 750 units until 1942, could carry up to 11 men in three rows, covered by a canvas structure. As well as a tractor for the 10.5 leFH 18 howitzer, the vehicle was to be used to tow heavy equipment for engineer units. Production was carried out by both Büssing-NAG and Daimler-Benz.

== Description ==
The engine used gave , depending on the production version. Sd.Kfz. 6 was used by the various German military forces (Army, Waffen-SS, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) for the entire war.

== Variants ==

* Sd.Kfz. 6
:Standard half-tracked vehicle for Pioneers, used for towing Pioneer equipment and transporting fifteen men.
* Sd.Kfz. 6/1
:Standard half-tracked vehicle for Artillery, used for towing artillery pieces and transporting 10 men plus 500 kg equipment.
* Sd.Kfz. 6/2 &quot;3,7 cm FlaK36 auf Fahrgestell Zugkraftwagen 5t&quot;
:A Sd.Kfz. 6 fitted with a 3.7 cm Flak 36 anti-aircraft gun, sides would fold down to allow space to work on. Crew of seven., with three loaders and two gunners in the back, with the rest in the front. 203 vehicles were produced for the Luftwaffe from 1939 to 1941. The gun had an elevation of -8° to +85°.
* Sd.Kfz. 6/3 &quot;7,62 cm FK 296(r) auf Selbstfahrlafette Zugkraftwagen 5t&quot; 
:A Panzerjaeger constructed from a Sd.Kfz. 6 carrying a captured Soviet 76mm F-22 gun &quot;portée&quot; within an armoured superstructure. The gun was emplaced on the rear on its field carriage and thick armour plates were added to the sides and rear to augment the protection given by the gun shield. Nine were produced in 1941-42

<text>Mabel Lilian Poulton (13 April 1901 – 21 December 1994) was an English film actress, popular in Britain during the era of silent films.

==Career==
Born in Bethnal Green, London, England, Poulton worked as a stenographer and entered films by chance. Her first role in George Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; (1920) was opposite Betty Balfour, who was also making her debut, and the film was a success. Over the next several years, Poulton was cast in a succession of roles, and usually played feisty or mischievous characters. A petite blonde, she also became well regarded for her fashion style, and was a highly recognisable celebrity. In 1928, she starred in &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; by Adrian Brunel and received excellent reviews for her performance. By the end of the decade, she was considered to be one of Britain&#x27;s leading screen actresses along with Balfour, and was described by critics as Balfour&#x27;s only serious rival.

The advent of sound film brought a premature end to Poulton&#x27;s film career. The addition of the microphone revealed Poulton&#x27;s broad Cockney accent, which was at odds with the characters she had become identified with. Like Clara Bow who faced the same problem as a result of her Brooklyn accent, Poulton struggled to maintain her status. Also, like Bow, she attempted to mount a comeback in the mid-1930s, which was well publicised but unsuccessful. She made her final film appearance in 1938.

==Later years and death==
She spent her last years writing and re-writing a typescript about a young British starlet who is raped by a film director and who then descends into alcoholism. In biro, at some point of the writing process, she wrote in real names. Thomas Bentley is the director whom she accused. They had worked together on two films: &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; (1921) and &quot;Not Quite a Lady&quot; (1928).

Poulton died in 1994 in Merton, Surrey, aged 93.

<text>Aloys Sprenger (born 3 September 1813, in Nassereith, Tyrol; died 19 December 1893 in Heidelberg) was an Austrian Orientalist.
Sprenger studied medicine, natural sciences as well as oriental languages at the University of Vienna. In 1836 he moved to London, where he worked with the Earl of Munster on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Kriegswissenschaften bei den mohammedanischen Völkern&quot;, ‘History of Military Science among the Muslim Peoples’, and thence in 1843 to Calcutta, where he became principal of Delhi College. In this capacity he had many textbooks translated into Hindustani from European languages.

In 1848 he was sent to Lucknow, to prepare a catalogue of the royal library there, the first volume of which appeared in Calcutta in 1854. This book, with its lists of Persian poets, its careful description of all the chief works of Persian poetry and its valuable biographical material, became a worthy guide for the exploration of Persian literature.

In 1850 Sprenger was named examiner, official government interpreter, and secretary of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. He published many works while holding this latter position, among them “Dictionary of the Technical terms used in the sciences of the Musulmans” (1854) and “Ibn Hajar&#x27;s biographical dictionary of persons who knew Mohammed” (1856).

Sprenger took a position as professor of oriental languages at the University of Bern in 1857, moving in 1881 to Heidelberg. His voluminous collection of Arabic, Persian, Hindustani and other manuscripts and printed material was eventually acquired by the Berlin State Library.

<text>The IV (StuG IV) (Sd.Kfz. 167) was a German assault gun variant of the Panzer IV used in the latter part of the Second World War. It was identical in role and concept to the highly successful StuG III assault gun variant of the Panzer III. Both StuG models were given an exclusively tank destroyer role in German formations and tactical planning in the last two years of the war, greatly augmenting the capability of the dwindling tank force available to the German army on the Eastern and Western fronts.

==Development==

The IV resulted from Krupp&#x27;s effort to supply an assault gun. As Krupp did not build &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; IIIs, they used the &quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; IV chassis in combination with a slightly modified superstructure.

The first known proposal for a on the Panzer IV chassis is in Krupp drawing number W1468 dated February 1943. This initial drawing utilised the outdated Ausf. F superstructure on a Panzer IV chassis. This proposal had a sloped front superstructure with a combat weight of 28.26 tons. Krupp abandoned it in February 1943 because it was too heavy. Plans for the StuG IV were halted.

During the Führer Conference of 19 to 22 August 1943, after the Battle of Kursk, Hitler had seen reports of the StuG III outperforming the Panzer IV when used in an infantry support role and tactical defence. Convinced that a tank-hunter version would be superior to the tank version, Hitler planned to switch Panzer IV production to &quot;&quot;Panzerjäger&quot; IV&quot; production as soon as possible. It was to mount the same 7.5 cm L/70 used for the Panther. Another manufacturer, Vomag built a prototype Panzerjäger IV with 7.5 cm L/48 gun and demonstrated it on 20 October 1943. It was later re-designated as &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV Ausf. F. As the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV was already being produced by Vomag, the StuG IV may not have materialized, had it not been for the major disruption of StuG III production, and the scarce supply of the 7.5 cm L/70 gun designated for the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV.

In November 1943, Alkett, the manufacturer of the StuG III, suffered damage due to an Allied bombing raid. They produced 255 StuG III in October 1943, but in December production fell to just 24 vehicles. A conference held from 6 to 7 December 1943, addressed possible solutions to this problem. Hitler welcomed the suggestion of taking the StuG III superstructure and mounting it on a Panzer IV chassis. The StuG IV could be more quickly manufactured than the Jagdpanzer IV at the time. This restarted the IV project. This time, the superstructure of the StuG III Ausf. G was mounted on a Panzer IV chassis 7, with a box compartment for the driver added. Combat weight was 23000 kg, lighter than the 23900 kg for the StuG III Ausf. G. Between 16 and 17 December 1943, Hitler was shown the StuG IV and approved it. To make up for the large deficit in StuG III production StuG IV production was now given full support.

From December 1943 to May 1945, Krupp built 1,111 StuG IVs, in early 1944 Alkett built 30 Stug IVs using new Panzer IV chassis sent from Nibelungenwerk. While the number is smaller than the 10,000+ StuG III, the StuG IV supplemented and fought along with StuG III during 1944–45, when they were most needed.

== Design ==
The StuG IV became known as an effective tank killer, especially on the Eastern Front.

It had a four-man crew, and was issued mainly to infantry divisions.
* Commander in hull left rear
* Gunner in hull left center
* Loader in hull right rear
* Driver in hull left front

==Surviving vehicles==
There are presently six surviving examples of the StuG IV.
*Poland
**One in the &quot;Muzeum im. Orła Białego&quot; (White Eagle Museum) a military museum located in the town of Skarżysko-Kamienna. It is a makeshift restoration using a StuG IV hull and various parts from Stug IIIs and Panzer IVs.
**One in the Armoured Warfare Museum in Poznań. It is complete and in running condition.
*Latvia
**In October 2011, a StuG IV found in a swamp in the former Courland Pocket was restored by a Latvian enthusiast. This vehicle, with no engine or gearbox, was offered for sale on milweb.net at an asking price of 425,000 Euros. It was also listed on eBay with a &quot;Buy It Now&quot; price of 900,000 US Dollars.
*Australia
**A working StuG IV was restored by the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum.
* Russia
** Restored by the Vadim Zadorozhny Museum.
** One in the Museum Of Military Equipment &quot;Battle Glory Of The Urals&quot;. This vehicle was restored in 2009-2010 and lacks an engine and transmission.

<doc id="1141135" wikidata="Q1035226" url="?curid=1141135" title="Caput medusae">
<text>Caput medusae is the appearance of distended and engorged superficial epigastric veins, which are seen radiating from the umbilicus across the abdomen. The name &quot;caput medusae&quot; (Latin for &quot;head of Medusa&quot;) originates from the apparent similarity to Medusa&#x27;s head, which had venomous snakes in place of hair. It is also a sign of portal hypertension. When the portal vein, that transfers the blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver, is blocked, the blood volume increases in the peripheral blood vessels making them appear engorged. It is caused by dilation of the paraumbilical veins, which carry oxygenated blood from mother to fetus &quot;in utero&quot; and normally close within one week of birth, becoming re-canalised due to portal hypertension caused by formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) in liver.The appearance is due to cutanous portosystemic collateral formation between distended and engorged paraumbilical veins that radiate from the umbilicus across the abdomen to join systemic veins.

==Differential diagnosis==
===Inferior vena cava obstruction===
* Produces abdominal collateral veins to bypass the blocked inferior vena cava and permit venous return from the legs.

Determine the direction of flow in the veins below the umbilicus. After pushing down on the prominent vein, blood will:
* flow toward the legs → caput medusae
* flow toward the head → inferior vena cava obstruction.
* Color Doppler ultrasonography is used to differentiate between vena cava obstruction and portal hypertension

== See also ==
* Portacaval anastomosis
In &quot;Liver Cirrhosis&quot;, the paraumbilical veins open up to transfer portal venous blood into systemic circulation. It results in caput medusae.

<doc id="1141136" wikidata="Q910690" url="?curid=1141136" title="G. N. Ramachandran">
<text>Gopalasamudram Narayanan Ramachandran, or G.N. Ramachandran, FRS (8 October 1922 – 7 April 2001) was an Indian physicist who was known for his work that led to his creation of the Ramachandran plot for understanding peptide structure. He was the first to propose a triple-helical model for the structure of collagen. He subsequently went on to make other major contributions in biology and physics.

== Early life and education ==
Ramachandran was born in the town of Ernakulam, Kingdom of Cochin, India to a Tamil family. He completed his BSc honours in Physics from St Joseph&#x27;s College, Tiruchirappalli in 1939. He joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1942 in the Electrical Engineering Department. Quickly realising his interest in physics, he switched to the Department of Physics to complete his master&#x27;s and doctoral thesis under the supervision of Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman. In 1942, he received a master&#x27;s degree in physics from Madras University with his thesis submitted from Bangalore (he did not attend any Madras college at that time). He subsequently received his D.Sc. degree in 1947. Here he mostly studied crystal physics and crystal optics. During his studies he created an X-ray focusing mirror for the X-ray microscope. The resulting field of crystal topography is used extensively in studies involving crystal growth and solid-state reactivity.

Ramachandran then spent two years (1947–1949) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where he earned his PhD for &#x27;studies on X-ray diffuse scattering and its application to determination of elastic constants&#x27; under the direction of Professor William Alfred Wooster, popularly known as W.A. Wooster, a leading crystallography expert in the world.

== Research works ==
After completing his PhD, he returned to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in 1949 as an assistant professor of physics. In 1952, he moved to Madras University as professor and head of the Department of Physics where he continued his work on crystal physics. His interest, however, shifted to the structure of biological macromolecules. Using X-ray diffraction Ramachandran along with Gopinath Kartha proposed and published the triple helical structure of collagen in 1954 in the journal Nature, drawing worldwide scientific attention to the &quot;Madras group&quot;.

At Madras University, Professor Ramachandran was the favourite of the famous vice-chancellor and celebrated doctor and medical scientist, Sir Arcot Laksmanaswamy Mudaliar. Wanting to tackle problems at a more fundamental level, Ramachandran decided to use this information to examine the various polypeptide conformations then known and also to develop a good &#x27;yardstick&#x27; that could be used for examining and assessing any structure in general, but peptides in particular. The result which emerged from these calculations in 1962, – now commonly known as the Ramachandran plot – was published in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1963 and has become an essential tool in the field of protein conformation. When it was first calculated, crystal structures had barely been obtained for any protein. From the mid-1960s onward, Ramachandran studied many topics relating to the conformation of peptides including types of β-turns, conformation of prolyl residues, cis-peptide units, occurrence and need for non-planarity of the peptides, NMR coupling constants, peptides containing L and D residues and many others.

He was awarded the prestigious Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1968 for research on &quot;Protein and Polypeptide Conformation&quot;; he was one of its first recipients. Ramachandran can be credited for bringing together into the one field of molecular biophysics the then disparate fields of X-ray crystallography, peptide synthesis, NMR and other optical studies, and physico-chemical experimentation. In 1970, he founded the Molecular Biophysics Unit at the Indian Institute of Science which was later known as the Centre of Advanced Study in Biophysics.

Ramachandran and A.V. Lakshminarayanan developed convolution-backprojection algorithms which greatly improved the quality and practicality of results obtainable by x-ray tomography. Compared to previously used methods, their algorithms considerably reduced computer processing time for image reconstruction, as well as providing more numerically accurate images. As a result, commercial manufacturers of x-ray tomographic scanners started building systems capable of reconstructing high resolution images that were almost photographically perfect. In 1971, they published their research in PNAS.

In 1981, Ramachandran became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

Notable awards that Ramachandran received include the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Physics in India (1961) and the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London. In 1999, the International Union of Crystallography honoured him with the Ewald Prize for his &#x27;outstanding contributions to crystallography&#x27;. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize as well for his fundamental contributions in protein structure and function.

== Later years ==
Ramachandran was devastated by the death of his wife Rajalakshmi in 1998 and his health gradually deteriorated. During the last few years of his life, he suffered a stroke and was affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Ramachandran died in 2001 at age 78.

== Legacy ==
Each year, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) awards the &quot;G N Ramachandran Gold Medal for Excellence in Biological Sciences &amp; Technology&quot; in his memory for work in Biological Sciences &amp; Technology.

<text>La Santa María de la Inmaculada Concepción ( ), or La Santa María (), originally La Gallega (), was the largest of the three small ships used by Christopher Columbus in his first expedition across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, with the backing of the Spanish monarchs. Her master and owner was Juan de la Cosa.

==History==
&quot;Santa María&quot; was built in Pontevedra, Galicia. &quot;Santa María&quot; was a medium-sized commercial nau or carrack, about long on deck, and according to Juan Escalante de Mendoza in 1575, &quot;Santa María&quot; was &quot;&quot;very little larger than&quot; 100 toneladas&quot; (about 100 tons, or tuns) burthen, or burden, and was used as the flagship for the expedition. &quot;Santa María&quot; had a single deck and three small masts.

The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the smaller caravel-type ships &quot;Santa Clara&quot;; one particular ship sailed for 46 years and was remembered as &quot;La Niña&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Girl&quot;), and &quot;La Pinta&quot; (&quot;The Painted&quot;&quot;). All these ships were second-hand (if not third- or more) and were not intended for exploration. &quot;Niña&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and the &quot;Santa María&quot; were modest-sized merchant vessels comparable in size to a modern cruising yacht. The exact measurements of length and width of the three ships have not survived, but good estimates of their burden capacity can be judged from contemporary anecdotes written down by one or more of Columbus&#x27;s crew members, and contemporary Spanish and Portuguese shipwrecks from the late 15th and early 16th centuries which are comparable in size to that of &quot;Santa María&quot;. These include the ballast piles and keel lengths of the Molasses Reef Wreck and Highborn Cay Wreck in the Bahamas. Both were caravel vessels in length overall, keel length and in width, and rated between 100 and 150 tons burden. &quot;Santa María&quot;, being Columbus&#x27; largest ship, was only about this size, and &quot;Niña&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; were smaller, at only 50 to 75 tons burden and perhaps on deck (updated dimensional estimates are discussed below in the section entitled Replicas).

==Shipwreck==
With three masts, &quot;Santa María&quot; was the slowest of Columbus&#x27; vessels but performed well in the Atlantic Ocean crossing. Then on the return trip, on 24 December (1492), not having slept for two days, Columbus decided at 11:00 p.m. to lie down to sleep. The night being calm, the steersman also decided to sleep, leaving only a cabin boy to steer the ship, a practice which the admiral had always strictly forbidden. With the boy at the helm, the currents carried the ship onto a sandbank, running her aground off the present-day site of Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. It sank the next day. Realizing that the ship was beyond repair, Columbus ordered his men to strip the timbers from the ship. The timbers were later used to build a fort which Columbus called &quot;La Navidad&quot; (Christmas) because the wreck occurred on Christmas Day, north from the modern town of Limonade.

&quot;Santa María&quot; carried several anchors, possibly six. One of the anchors now rests in the Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien (MUPANAH), in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

On 13 May 2014, underwater archaeological explorer Barry Clifford claimed that his team had found the wreck of &quot;Santa María&quot;. In the following October, UNESCO&#x27;s expert team published their final report, concluding that the wreck could not be Columbus&#x27;s vessel. Fastenings used in the hull and possible copper sheathing dated it to the 17th or 18th century.

==Crew==
Columbus&#x27; crew was not composed of criminals as is widely believed. Many were experienced seamen from the port of Palos in Andalusia and its surrounding countryside, as well as from the region of Galicia in northwest Spain. It is true, however, that the Spanish sovereigns offered an amnesty to convicts who signed up for the voyage; still, only four men took up the offer: one who had killed a man in a fight, and three friends of his who had then helped him escape from jail.

Despite the romantic legend that the Queen of Spain had used a necklace that she had received from her husband the king as collateral for a loan, the voyage was principally financed by a syndicate of seven noble Genovese bankers resident in Seville (the group was linked to Amerigo Vespucci and funds belonging to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de Medici). Hence, all the accounting and recording of the voyage was kept in Seville. This also applies to the second voyage, even though the syndicate had by then disbanded.

The crew of &quot;Santa María&quot; is well-known, albeit in many cases, there are no surnames and the crewman&#x27;s place of origin was used to differentiate him from others with the same given name.

==Replicas==
Little is definitively known about the actual dimensions of &quot;Santa María&quot;, since no documentation or illustration has survived from that era. Since the 19th century, various notable replicas have been publicly commissioned or privately constructed.

===Quadricentennial===
Interest in reconstructing &quot;Santa María&quot; started in Spain at around 1890 for the 400th anniversary of Columbus&#x27;s voyage. An 1892 reconstruction by the Spanish government depicted the ship as a nau.

===West Edmonton Mall (1986)===
A replica was built during Expo 1986 and anchored in &quot;Deep Sea Adventure Lake&quot; at West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada. Built at False Creek in Vancouver, British Columbia, the ship was hand-carved and hand-painted, and then transported by flatbed trucks across the Rocky Mountains to Edmonton, Alberta.
===Quincentennial (1991)===

A replica, depicted as a carrack, was commissioned by the city of Columbus, Ohio. It was built by the Scarano Brothers Boat Building Company in Albany, New York, who later cut the ship in half and transported it by truck to the Scioto River. The replica cost about $1.2 million. The ship was constructed out of white cedar as opposed to the oak used on the original to give the ship a long life in the Scioto River and to reduce cost. The main mast was carved out of a single douglas fir tree and was equipped with a top sail (since removed). The ship was built using power tools, with a hull length of , keel length , beam , depth and load . The foremast is high, the mainmast is and mizzen mast is . The replica was declared by Jose Maria Martinez-Hidalgo, a Spanish marine historian, to be the most authentic replica of the &quot;Santa María&quot; in the world during the ship&#x27;s coronation on 12 October 1991. Dana Rinehart, the 50th mayor of Columbus, christened the ship as part of the 500th anniversary of its voyage. The ship was removed from its moorings in 2014, cut into 10 pieces, and stored in a lot south of the city, pending funding to do repairs and restorations. As of early 2016, the plans for restoration have stalled.

===Madeira (1998)===
A functional replica was built on the Portuguese island of Madeira, between July 1997 and July 1998, by craftsmen from the fishing village of Câmara de Lobos. The ship is long and wide. In 1998 &quot;Santa María&quot; represented the Madeira Wine Expo 98 in Lisbon, where she was visited by over 97,000 people in 25 days. Since then thousands more have sailed and continue to sail aboard that &quot;Santa María&quot; replica which is located in Funchal.

===Puszczykowo (2008)===
A stationary full-size replica can be seen in the Arkady Fiedler Museum in Puszczykowo, Poland (near Poznań). The ship was built there in 2004-2008, within the Garden of Cultures and Tolerance, by Fiedler&#x27;s sons with a ship modeller, Rajmund Korcz, and two assistants.

<text>La Niña (Spanish for &quot;The Girl&quot;) was one of the three Spanish ships used by Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in his first voyage to the West Indies in 1492. As was tradition for Spanish ships of the day, she bore a female saint&#x27;s name, Santa Clara. However, she was commonly referred to by her nickname, &quot;La Niña&quot; (&#x27;The Little Girl&#x27;), which was probably a pun on the name of her owner, Juan Niño of Moguer (&#x27;Niño&#x27;, his surname, meaning &#x27;Little Boy&#x27;). She was a standard caravel-type vessel.

The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the caravel-type and the carrack-type . &quot;Niña&quot; was by far Columbus&#x27;s favorite. She was originally lateen sail rigged &quot;caravela latina&quot;, but she was re-rigged as a &quot;caravela redonda&quot; at Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, with square sails for better ocean performance. There is no authentic documentation on the specifics of &quot;Niña&quot;″s design, although Michele de Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, mentioned that &quot;Niña&quot; was &quot;&quot;about&quot; 60 toneladas&quot; (60 tons), which may indicate a medium-sized caravel of around in length on deck. Often said to have had three masts, there is some evidence she may have had four masts.

&quot;Niña&quot;, like &quot;Pinta&quot; and &quot;Santa María&quot;, was a smaller trade ship built to sail the Mediterranean sea, not the open ocean. It was greatly surpassed in size by ships like of the Hanseatic League, built in 1462, in length, and the English carrack , built during the period 1420–1439, weighing between 1,400 and 2,750 tons, and long, in both weight and length.

On Columbus&#x27;s first expedition, &quot;Niña&quot; carried 26 men, commanded by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón. They left Palos de la Frontera on 3 August 1492, stopping at the Canary Islands on 12 August 1492, and continued westward. Landfall was made in the Bahamas at dawn on 12 October 1492.

On 14 February 1493, in the east of the Azores, a storm threatened to capsize &quot;Niña&quot;, and at Columbus&#x27;s instigation, he and the crew took a series of vows to perform certain acts including religious pilgrimages upon their return to Spain. &quot;Niña&quot; reached Lisbon, Portugal, on 4 March 1493, and arrived in Palos de la Frontera on 15 March 1493. On the first voyage to America, the crew of &quot;Niña&quot; slept on the deck but adopted the use of hammocks after seeing Native Americans utilizing them.

On September 25, 1493, the caravel &quot;La Niña&quot; was part of the flotilla of Columbus&#x27; second voyage. Already in the new lands, she left as captain of an exploration trip in which the southern coast of Cuba and Jamaica were discovered. On June 30, 1494, during the return of this trip, &quot;La Niña&quot; hit bottom and suffered damage.

In the summer of 1495 at the port of Isabela, in Hispaniola, a cyclone damaged the &quot;Niña,&quot; and sank all the other moored ships. The caravel &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; was then built following the model of &quot;La Niña&quot; to replace the sunken ships. The &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, also known as &quot;La India&quot;, was the first ship built in America by the Spanish. On June 11, 1496, the vessel returned to Spain with Columbus on board, as flagship.

&quot;Niña&quot; was then chartered for an unauthorized voyage to Rome. She was captured by a pirate corsair when leaving the port of Cagliari and brought to Cape Pula, Sardinia. The Captain, Alonso Medel, escaped with a few men. He stole a boat, rowed back to &quot;Niña&quot;, and made sail, returning to Cádiz.

In 1498, she returned to Hispaniola as advance guard of Columbus&#x27;s Third Voyage. She was lying in wait at Santo Domingo in 1500. In 1501, she made a trading voyage to the Pearl Coast on the island of Cubagua, Venezuela, and no further log of her is found in historic archives.

&quot;Niña&quot; logged at least under Columbus&#x27; command.

==Replicas==
A replica of &quot;Niña&quot; was built by the Spanish government for the Columbian Naval Review of 1893. Along with replicas of &quot;Santa María&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; she participated in the review.

A replica of &quot;Niña&quot; (based upon theory; there are no known contemporary likenesses of any of the three ships) now sails around the world.

The 4-masted replica &quot;Niña&quot; was built 1988-1991 by engineer and naval researcher John Patrick Sarsfield, British naval historian Jonathan Morton Nance, and a group of master shipbuilders in Bahia, Brazil who were still using design and construction techniques dating back to the 15th century. They built it from heavy, teredo-resistant Brazilian hardwoods using only adzes, axes, hand saws, and chisels. The sails were designed by Nance using square main sails and two aft lateen sails as were used by ships of this size at the end of the 15th century. The crew of &quot;Niña&quot; say that it can make about , which is quicker than older designs of the era. The replica weighs 75 tons.

In 1991, the replica sailed to Costa Rica to take part in the filming of &quot;1492: Conquest of Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Niña&quot; has visited hundreds of North America ports to give the public a chance to see and tour the ship. The vessel continues to visit ports across the Eastern to mid-United States along with its sister replica ship, &quot;Pinta&quot;. On 16 September 2020 the ship went adrift after her dock broke up in Hurricane Sally at Pensacola, Florida. Her anchor line later snapped causing her to go ashore in Pensacola Bay near the Maritime Park, Pensacola. The replicas of &quot;Niña&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; were built in Valença, Brazil using the same methods as the 15th century Portuguese.

Other replicas are located in Andalusia, Spain (at El Puerto de Santa María and at the Wharf of the Caravels in Palos de la Frontera). A replica had been harbored in Corpus Christi, Texas in the United States, but it sank on April 23, 2017—from Hurricane Harvey.

The historic San Francisco restaurant Bernstein&#x27;s Fish Grotto was designed to look like &quot;Niña&quot;.

<text>La Pinta (Spanish for &quot;The Painted One&quot;, &quot;The Look&quot;, or &quot;The Spotted One&quot;) was the fastest of the three Spanish ships used by Christopher Columbus in his first transatlantic voyage in 1492. The New World was first sighted by Rodrigo de Triana aboard &quot;La Pinta&quot; on 12 October 1492. The owner of &quot;La Pinta&quot; was Cristóbal Quintero. The Quintero brothers were ship owners from Palos. The owner of the ship allowed Martín Alonso Pinzón to take over the ship so he could keep an eye on it.

&quot;La Pinta&quot; was a caravel-type vessel. By tradition Spanish ships were named after saints and usually given nicknames. Thus, &quot;La Pinta&quot;, like &quot;La Niña&quot;, was not the ship&#x27;s actual name; &quot;La Niña&#x27;s&quot; actual name was the &quot;Santa Clara&quot;. The &quot;Santa María&#x27;&quot;s original nickname was &quot;La Gallega&quot;. The actual original name of &quot;La Pinta&quot; is unknown. The origin of the ship is disputed but is believed to have been built in Spain in the year 1441. She was later rebuilt for use by Christopher Columbus.

==Detail==
&quot;La Pinta&quot; was square rigged and smaller than . The ship displaced approximately 60 tons, with an estimated deck length of and a width of . The crew size was 26 men under Captain Martín Alonso Pinzón.

The other ships of the Columbus expedition were &quot;La Niña&quot; (real name &quot;Santa Clara&quot;) and &quot;Santa María&quot;. There are no known contemporary likenesses of Columbus&#x27;s ships.

&quot;Santa María&quot; (also known as the &quot;Gallega&quot;) was the largest, of a type known as a carrack (&quot;carraca&quot; in Spanish), or by the Portuguese term &quot;nau&quot;. &quot;La Niña&quot; and &quot;La Pinta&quot; were smaller. They were called caravels, a name then given to the smallest three-masted vessels. Columbus once used the word for a vessel of forty tons, but it generally applied in Portuguese or Spanish use to a vessel ranging from 120 to 140 Spanish &quot;toneles&quot;. This word represents a capacity about one-tenth larger than that expressed by the modern English &quot;ton&quot;.

&quot;La Niña&quot;, &quot;La Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa María&quot; were not the largest ships in Europe at the time. They were small trade ships surpassed in size by ships like , built in Scotland in 1511 with a length of , and a crew of 300 sailors, 120 gunners, and up to 1,000 soldiers. of the Hanseatic League was built in 1462 and was long. Another large ship, the English carrack , was built during the period 1420–1439, was long, and displaced between 1,400 tons and 2,750 tons. Ships built in Europe in the 15th century were designed to sail the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean coastlines. Columbus&#x27; smaller-sized ships were considered riskier on the open ocean than larger ships. This made it difficult to recruit crew members, and a small number were jailed prisoners given a light sentence if they would sail with Columbus.

Most of the commerce of the time was the coastal commerce of the Mediterranean, so it was better if ships did not draw much water. As it sailed, the fleet of Columbus consisted of &quot;Gallega&quot; (the &quot;Galician&quot;), which he changed to &quot;Santa María&quot;, &quot;La Pinta&quot; and &quot;La Niña&quot;. Of these the first was about 100 tons, the second about 70 tons. &quot;La Niña&quot; was smaller, not more than 50 tons. One writer says that they were all without full decks, that is, that such decks as they had did not extend from stem to stern. Other authorities, however, speak as if &quot;La Niña&quot; only was an open vessel, and the two larger were decked. Columbus himself took command of &quot;Santa María&quot;, Martin Alonso Pinzon of &quot;La Pinta&quot;, and his brothers, Francis Martin and Vicente Yanez, of &quot;La Niña&quot;. The whole company in all three ships likely numbered 90 men (Santa Maria 40, La Nina 24, La Pinta 26) although some historians cite 120 men.

==Replicas==

A replica of &quot;La Pinta&quot; was built by the Spanish government for the Columbian Naval Review of 1893. Along with replicas of &quot;Santa María&quot; and &quot;La Niña&quot;, it participated in the review.

Replicas are on display in two locations in Spain:
* at the Wharf of the Caravels (Spanish: Muelle de las Carabelas) in Palos de la Frontera, Andalusia
* in Baiona, Pontevedra, Galicia

In 2008, a replica of &quot;La Pinta&quot;, although 15 feet (4.5 m) longer and 8 feet (2.4 m) wider than the original, was launched by the Christopher Columbus Foundation. This ship weighs about 100 tons and often sails alongside an authentic replica of &quot;La Niña&quot;, which was launched in 1991.
==Legacy==
Pinta in the Galapagos Islands is named for the ship and Pinzón Island for its captain.

<text>Oskar Schlemmer (; 4 September 1888 – 13 April 1943) was a German painter, sculptor, designer and choreographer associated with the Bauhaus school.

In 1923, he was hired as Master of Form at the Bauhaus theatre workshop, after working at the workshop of sculpture. His most famous work is &quot;Triadisches Ballett&quot; (Triadic Ballet), which saw costumed actors transformed into geometrical representations of the human body in what he described as a &quot;party of form and colour&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and apprenticeships ===
Born in September 1888 in Swabia, Germany, Oskar Schlemmer was the youngest of six children. His parents, Carl Leonhard Schlemmer and Mina Neuhaus, both died around 1900 and the young Oskar lived with his sister and learned at an early age to provide for himself. By 1903 he was completely independent and supporting himself as an apprentice in an inlay workshop, moving on to another apprenticeship in marquetry from 1905 to 1909.

Oskar Schlemmer studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in Stuttgart and won a scholarship to attend the Akademie der Bildenden Künste (State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart), where he studied under the tutelage of landscape painters Christian Landenberger and Friedrich von Keller starting in 1906. In 1910 Schlemmer moved to Berlin where he painted some of his first important works before returning to Stuttgart in 1912 as the master pupil of abstract artist Adolf Hölzel, abandoning impressionism and moving toward cubism in his work. In 1914 Schlemmer was enlisted to fight on the Western Front in World War I until he was wounded and moved to a position with the military cartography unit in Colmar, where he resided until returning to work under Hölzel in 1918. The doll-like figures he created in this period may have been a reaction to the wounded soldiers he saw in military hospitals during the war.

=== The Bauhaus years ===


In 1919 Schlemmer turned to sculpture and had an exhibition of his work at the gallery &quot;Der Sturm&quot; in Berlin. At the same time he helped to update the curriculum at the Stuttgart Academy of Fine Art with the appointment of new faculty and exhibitions of modern art. Among those involved were Paul Klee and Willi Baumeister. After his marriage to Helena Tutein in 1920, Schlemmer was invited to Weimar by Walter Gropius to run the mural-painting and sculpture departments at the Bauhaus School before taking over the stagecraft workshop from Lothar Schreyer in 1923. His complex ideas were influential, making him one of the most important teachers working at the school at that time. However, due to the heightened political atmosphere in Germany at the end of the 1920s, and in particular with the appointment of the Marxist architect Hannes Meyer as Gropius&#x27;s successor, in 1929 Schlemmer resigned his position and moved to take up a job at the Staatliche Akademie für Kunst und Kunstgewerbe Breslau.

Schlemmer became known internationally with the première of his &#x27;Triadisches Ballett&#x27; in Stuttgart in 1922. His work for the Bauhaus and his preoccupation with the theatre are an important factor in his work, which deals mainly with the problem of the figure in space. People, typically stylised faceless female figures, continued to be the predominant subject in his painting. While at Bauhaus, he developed the multidisciplinary course &quot;Der Mensch (The human being).&quot; In the human form he saw a measure that could provide a foothold in the disunity of his time. After using Cubism as a springboard for his structural studies, Schlemmer&#x27;s work became intrigued with the possibilities of figures and their relationship to the space around them, for example &#x27;Egocentric Space Lines&#x27; (1924). Schlemmer&#x27;s characteristic forms can be seen in his sculptures as well as his paintings. Yet he also turned his attention to stage design, first getting involved with this in 1929, executing settings for the opera &#x27;Nightingale&#x27; and the ballet &#x27;Renard&#x27; by Igor Stravinsky.

=== Life and death under the Third Reich ===
From 1928 to 1930, Schlemmer worked on nine murals for a room in the Folkwang Museum in Essen. After leaving the Bauhaus in 1929, Schlemmer took a post at the Akademie in Breslau, where he painted his most celebrated work, the &#x27;Bauhaustreppe&#x27;, (&#x27;Bauhaus Stairway&#x27;) (1932; Museum of Modern Art, New York). He was obliged to leave the Breslau Academy when it was closed down in the wake of the financial crisis following the Wall Street crash, and took up a professorship at Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Vereinigte Staatsschulen für freie und angewandete Kunst&quot; (United State School for Fine and Applied Art) in 1932, which he held until 1933 when he was forced to resign due to pressure from the Nazis. The Schlemmers then moved to Eichberg near the Swiss border, and then to Sehringen before his pictures were displayed at the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in 1937. The last ten years of his life were spent in a state of &#x27;inner emigration&#x27;. Max Bill, in his obituary of Schlemmer, wrote that it was &#x27;as if a curtain of silence&#x27; had descended over him during this time.

During World War II, Schlemmer worked at the Institut für Malstoffe in Wuppertal, along with Willi Baumeister and Georg Muche, run by the philanthropist Kurt Herbert. The factory offered Schlemmer the opportunity to paint without the fear of persecution. His series of eighteen small, mystical paintings entitled &quot;Fensterbilder&quot; (&quot;Window Pictures,&quot; 1942) were painted while looking out the window of his house and observing neighbors engaged in their domestic tasks. These were Schlemmer&#x27;s final works before his death of a heart attack in the hospital at Baden-Baden in 1943.

== Legacy ==
Schlemmer&#x27;s ideas on art were complex and challenging even for the progressive Bauhaus movement. His work, nevertheless, was widely exhibited in both Germany and outside the country—a rejection of pure abstraction, instead retaining a sense of the human, though not in the emotional sense but in view of the physical structure of the human. He represented bodies as architectural forms, reducing the figure to a rhythmic play between convex, concave and flat surfaces. And not just of its form, he was fascinated by every movement the body could make—trying to capture it in his work. As well as leaving a large body of work behind, Schlemmer&#x27;s art theories have also been published. A comprehensive book of his letters and diary entries from 1910 to 1943 is also available.

Along with Schlemmer&#x27;s diary, his private letters to Otto Meyer and Willi Baumeister have given valuable insight on what happened at the Bauhaus, especially his writings of how the staff and students responded to the many changes and developments at the school.

Schlemmer&#x27;s first retrospective in the United States was mounted by the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1986.

In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Triadic Ballet&quot; the 23rd best work of performance art in history, writing, &quot;A major signal of the Bauhaus movement, &quot;Triadic Ballet&quot; cemented its place in history as one of the first examples of multimedia performance. Schlemmer even created his costumes first, and then designed the choreography around them&quot;. On 4 September 2018, to commemorate what would have been his 130th birthday, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating him.

=== Controversy ===
In 2000, the artist&#x27;s daughter Ute Jaina Schlemmer, who asserted that she owns the painting &quot;Bauhaus Stairway (Bauhaustreppe)&quot; or is owed money for it, obtained a court order to hold it for further investigation while it was on temporary loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Before the injunction was served on the Neue Nationalgalerie, &quot;Bauhaus Stairway&quot; had already been packed and shipped to New York.

== Art market ==
In 1998, Schlemmer&#x27;s &quot;Idealistic Encounter&quot; (1928) was sold for $1.487 million at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York.

<text>Louis Charles Alphonse Léodgard d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Beaujolais (7 October 1779 – 30 May 1808) was a French prince of the blood, son of Philippe Égalité and the younger brother of King Louis-Philippe I of the French.

==Biography==

Louis Charles was born at the Palais-Royal in Paris. He was the third and youngest son of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orléans as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;, and of his wife, Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;prince du sang&quot;.

His mother was the greatest heiress of the age as the only surviving child of the vastly wealthy duc de Penthièvre. She was also the sister in law of the famous &quot;princesse de Lamballe&quot;.

In 1781 the Countess of Genlis was appointed to be the governess to Louis-Charles and to his two older brothers Louis-Philippe and Antoine. Two years later the abbé Mariottini, nephew of the apostolic nuncio to France was made his tutor, but he resigned in 1786 after a conflict with Madame de Genlis. Louis Charles was then tutored by the first chamberlain Barrois, before being assigned to the under-governor Lebrun in 1789.

In April 1793 Louis Charles was arrested with his father and imprisoned at Fort-Saint-Jean in Marseille. During his imprisonment he contracted tuberculosis, a condition which eventually caused his death. His father was executed in November 1793 but Louis Charles remained imprisoned until August 1796 when the Directory decided to exile him and his brother Antoine to Philadelphia. The French chargé d&#x27;affaires in Philadelphia settled upon Louis-Charles an annual pension of 15,000 francs.

In February 1797 Louis Charles and Antoine were joined in Philadelphia by their older brother Louis Philippe. Together they travelled to New York City and Boston, and as far north as Maine and as far south as Nashville.

In September 1797 Louis Charles and his brothers learnt that their mother had gone into exile in Spain, and so they decided to return to Europe. They went to New Orleans, planning to sail to Cuba and from there to Spain. The ship they took from New Orleans, however, was captured by a British warship in the Gulf of Mexico.

The British seized the three brothers, but took them to Havana anyway. Unable to find passage to Europe, the three brothers spent a year in Cuba, until they were unexpectedly expelled by the Spanish authorities. They sailed via the Bahamas to Nova Scotia. Eventually, the brothers sailed back to New York, and in January 1800, they arrived in England, where they settled at Twickenham outside London.

In September 1804 Louis Charles entered the Royal Navy, but his health did not allow him to continue a military career. In October he and his brothers went on a brief expedition to the French coast. They were fired upon by the French batteries at Boulogne but escaped without harm.

In 1808, in an attempt to improve Louis Charles&#x27; health, his older brother Louis Philippe accompanied him on a voyage to Gibraltar, Sicily and Malta. The brothers were received at Casa Miari, a palace in the Maltese capital city Valletta.

Louis Charles, however, continued to deteriorate; he died of tuberculosis a fortnight after his arrival on the island. His funeral took place on 3 June. Ten years later his body was buried on 10 April 1818 in St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral in Valletta. James Pradier designed and sculpted his tomb, a replica of which is at Dreux.

Louis Charles&#x27; portrait was painted posthumously in 1818 by Albert Gregorius (now in the Palais Royal) and by Charles-Francois Phelippes (now in the Palais-Royal). Another portrait was painted in 1835 by Amédée Fauré (now at the Château d&#x27;Eu). There are copies of all three portraits in the Palace of Versailles.

<text>The &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV / Sd.Kfz. 162, was a German tank destroyer based on the Panzer IV chassis and built in three main variants. As one of the casemate-style turretless Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer, literally &quot;hunting tank&quot;) designs, it was developed against the wishes of Heinz Guderian, the inspector general of the &quot;Panzertruppen&quot;, as a replacement for the (&quot;StuG&quot; III). Guderian objected against the (in his eyes) needless diversion of resources from Panzer IV tank production, as the StuG III was still more than adequate for its role.

Officially, only the L/48-armed vehicle was named Jagdpanzer IV. The L/70-armed vehicle was named Panzer IV/70. In this article, both versions are referred to in general as Jagdpanzer IV, except in the variants and surviving vehicles section.

==Development==

With experience gained during the initial phases of the Battle of Stalingrad, in September 1942 the Wehrmacht&#x27;s arms bureau, the &quot;Waffenamt&quot;, called for a new standard for heavy assault guns: 100 mm of armor to the front, 40–50 mm on the sides, wider tracks, ground clearance of , top speed of and the lowest possible firing positions. The new &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; (&quot;tank hunter&quot;) design would be armed with the same 7.5 cm gun as fitted to the Panther tank: the Pak 42 L/70. Initially a new chassis was planned, but that of the Panzer IV had to be used.

Previous efforts to mount bigger guns on smaller chassis resulted in the Marder I, II and III series and the &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; III. The Marder series were tall and had open crew compartments. The new design had a low silhouette and completely enclosed, casemate-style fighting compartment.

The &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV used a modified Panzer IV &quot;Ausf.&quot; H chassis, but the almost-vertical front hull plate was replaced by sloped armor plates. Internally, the layout was changed to accommodate the new superstructure, moving the fuel tanks and ammunition racks. Since the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; lacked a turret, the auxiliary engine which powered the Panzer IV&#x27;s turret traverse mechanism could be eliminated.

The new superstructure had 80 mm thick sloped armour, giving much greater protection than vertical armour of 100 mm. To make the manufacturing process as simple as possible, the superstructure was made from large, interlocking plates that were welded together.

==Armament==
===Main gun===
Armament consisted of a 7.5 cm main gun firing Fixed QF 75 × 640mm R ammunition, originally intended to be the Pak 42 L/70. Due to shortages, older guns were initially used, the 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/43 for pre-production, and the 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/48 for the initial production variant. These were shorter and less powerful than the Pak 42, and also carried a muzzle brake.

Installing the much heavier Pak 42 meant that the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV was nose-heavy, especially with the heavy frontal armour. This made them less mobile and more difficult to operate in rough terrain, leading their crews to nickname them &quot;Guderian-Ente&quot; (&quot;Guderian&#x27;s duck&quot;). To prevent the rubber rims of the roadwheels being dislocated by the weight of the vehicle, some later versions had steel roadwheels installed on the front.

The final prototype of the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV was presented in December 1943 and production started in January 1944, with the Pak 39 L/48 armed variant staying in production until November. Production of the Pak 42 L/70 armed variants started in August and continued until March/April 1945.

===Secondary armament===
Early versions of the Jagdpanzer IV carried two standard (no modification made) MG 42 machine guns on both sides of the main gun mantlet/glacis, firing 7.92×57mm Mauser rifle ammunition through a firing port which was protected by an armored cover plate (with the MG 42 retracted) when not in use. As the main gun was located between these machine guns one machine gun could be operated from the left side only, which is impractical for non-left-handed operators, and the other one from the right side only. Later version Jagdpanzer IVs carried only one MG 42 as internal secondary armament with about 1,200 rounds of ammunition. The Jagdpanzer IV secondary armament was exceptional, as other World War II era German tanks or other armored vehicles used the MG 34 for internal secondary or co-axial armament.

==Production==
On 19–22 August 1943, after the Battle of Kursk, Hitler received reports that StuG IIIs performed better than the Panzer IV within the constraints of how they were deployed. It was thus intended to stop production of the Panzer IV itself at the end of 1944 to concentrate solely on production of the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV, but the Panzer IV continued to be produced until the end of the conflict along with &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV. VoMAG in Plauen switched completely from Panzer IV production to Jagdpanzer IV in Spring 1944, Krupp-Grusonwerk in Magdeburg switched to StuG IV in early 1944, and only the Nibelungenwerk in St. Valentin continued with Panzer IV production.

==Variants==

*&quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV &quot;0-Serie&quot;
:with 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/43: a small number of these were built as the preproduction (&quot;0-Serie&quot;) probably in December 1943.
*&quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV (&quot;Sd.Kfz.162&quot;)
:with 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/48, developed under the name &quot;Sturmgeschütz neuer Art mit 7.5 cm Pak L/48 auf Fahrgestell PzKpfw IV&quot;, with 769–784 produced in January 1944 - November 1944.
*&quot;Panzer&quot; IV/70 (V) (&quot;Sd.Kfz.162/1&quot;)
:was one of two variants armed with the same Pak 42 L/70 gun. The (V) stands for the designer, Vomag. The most produced version, with 930–940 built in August 1944 - April 1945. Equipped with a long, powerful L/70 7.5cm anti-tank gun that could outrange opposing Allied tank weapons, the Panzer IV/70(V) Lang proved a formidable foe. The &quot;Lang&quot; (German for &quot;long&quot;) in its name was added to distinguish it from its predecessor with a shorter L/48 7.5cm gun.
*&quot;Panzer&quot; IV/70 (A) (&quot;Sd.Kfz.162/1&quot;)
:the other Pak 42 L/70 armed &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV. In order to send Pak 42 L/70 armed vehicles to the front as soon as possible, in July 1944 Hitler ordered an interim solution to speed up Nibelungenwerke&#x27;s transition from Panzer IV production to Panzer IV/70 production. &quot;A&quot; stands for Alkett, a manufacturer of the StuG III, that was ordered to redesign the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV superstructure to be mounted onto a standard Panzer IV chassis. The Vomag design used a modified chassis permitting a very low silhouette. Mounting the superstructure onto the original Panzer IV chassis required additional vertical steel plates mounted onto the chassis to counter height differences. The resulting vehicle was about 40 cm taller and lacked the sharp edged nose of the Vomag variant. Only 278 were built by Nibelungenwerke from August 1944 to March 1945.

Minor modifications and improvements were made throughout the production runs of all variants, as well as several field improvements, the most common being the addition of armour sideskirts (or in German, Schürzen).

Originally the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV&#x27;s gun had a muzzle brake installed, but because the gun was so close to the ground, each time it was fired, huge dust clouds would betray the vehicle&#x27;s position, leading many crews to remove the muzzle brake in the field. Later variants dispensed with the muzzle brake.

Early vehicles had &quot;zimmerit&quot; applied to the hull to protect against magnetic mines, but this was discontinued after about September 1944. Later vehicles had three return rollers rather than the original four, and adopted the twin vertical exhausts typical of the late Panzer IV series.

==Combat history==
The &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV served in the anti-tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. The vehicle fought against Western Allied forces in Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, and Soviet tanks and troops on the Eastern Front. It was very successful as a tank destroyer due to its low profile, accurate gun and good armour protection, but performed poorly when used out of role as a substitute for tanks or assault guns to support infantry. This was increasingly necessary in the later stages of the war from late 1944 to 1945, because there was often nothing else available to the badly depleted German armoured units.

Romania received several &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV/70 from the Red Army after the war ended. They were officially known as TAs T4 in their army&#x27;s inventory and were used until 1950 when they were phased out. German armour in Romanian service, including the Jagdpanzer IV, was replaced entirely with Soviet vehicles in 1954. Bulgaria also received Jagdpanzer IVs from both Germany and the Soviet Union (most coming from the latter post-war), and they saw limited service in the postwar Bulgarian military before being stripped of all engine components, dug in and turned into fixed gun emplacements on its border with neighbouring Turkey, as part of the Krali Marko Line (now fallen into disrepair). Most of these ex-German vehicles have been dug up recently, with some scrapped while others await restoration locally or abroad.

&quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV aces include &quot;SS-Oberscharführer&quot; (Senior squad leader) Rudolf Roy from the 12th SS &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; Battalion of 12th SS Panzer Division, who was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for battlefield bravery and credited with 36 tank kills. He was killed by an American sniper while looking out of the hatch of his &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; IV on December 17 in 1944 during the Ardennes Offensive in Belgium, the last major German offensive on the Western Front.

After the war, West Germany continued the &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot; concept with the &quot;Kanonenjagdpanzer&quot;, but few other fixed-casemate self-propelled guns were built in the postwar era. An innovative exception was the Swedish Stridsvagn 103, more widely known as the &quot;S-Tank&quot;.

Along with Panzer IVs and Sturmgeschütz IIIs, Syria acquired in the 1950s six Jagdpanzer IV L/48s. These were used in the conflicts with Israel up until 1967 when most were either destroyed, abandoned on the Golan Heights overlooking Israel, or scrapped.

<doc id="1141150" wikidata="Q1191862" url="?curid=1141150" title="Rouché's theorem">
<text>Rouché&#x27;s theorem, named after Eugène Rouché, states that for any two complex-valued functions and holomorphic inside some region formula_1 with closed contour formula_2, if on formula_2, then and have the same number of zeros inside formula_1, where each zero is counted as many times as its multiplicity. This theorem assumes that the contour formula_2 is simple, that is, without self-intersections. Rouché&#x27;s theorem is an easy consequence of a stronger symmetric Rouché&#x27;s theorem described below.

== Usage ==
The theorem is usually used to simplify the problem of locating zeros, as follows. Given an analytic function, we write it as the sum of two parts, one of which is simpler and grows faster than (thus dominates) the other part. We can then locate the zeros by looking at only the dominating part. For example, the polynomial formula_6 has exactly 5 zeros in the disk formula_7 since formula_8 for every formula_9, and formula_10, the dominating part, has five zeros in the disk.

== Geometric explanation ==
It is possible to provide an informal explanation of Rouché&#x27;s theorem.

Let &quot;C&quot; be a closed, simple curve (i.e., not self-intersecting). Let &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) + &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are both holomorphic on the interior of &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;h&quot; must also be holomorphic on the interior of &quot;C&quot;. Then, with the conditions imposed above, the Rouche&#x27;s theorem in its original (and not symmetric) form says that

Notice that the condition |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| &gt; |&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| means that for any &quot;z&quot;, the distance from &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) to the origin is larger than the length of &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), which in the following picture means that for each point on the blue curve, the segment joining it to the origin is larger than the green segment associated with it. Informally we can say that the blue curve &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is always closer to the red curve &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) than it is to the origin.

The previous paragraph shows that &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) must wind around the origin exactly as many times as &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). The index of both curves around zero is therefore the same, so by the argument principle, and must have the same number of zeros inside .

One popular, informal way to summarize this argument is as follows: If a person were to walk a dog on a leash around and around a tree, such that the distance between the person and the tree is always greater than the length of the leash, then the person and the dog go around the tree the same number of times.

== Applications ==
=== Bounding roots ===
Consider the polynomial formula_11 with formula_12. By the quadratic formula it has two zeros at formula_13. Rouché&#x27;s theorem can be used to obtain some hint about their positions. Since
formula_14

Rouché&#x27;s theorem says that the polynomial has exactly one zero inside the disk formula_15. Since formula_16 is clearly outside the disk, we conclude that the zero is formula_17.

In general, a polynomial formula_18. If formula_19 for some formula_20, then by Rouche&#x27;s theorem, the polynomial has exactly formula_21 roots inside formula_22.

This sort of argument can be useful in locating residues when one applies Cauchy&#x27;s residue theorem.

=== Fundamental theorem of algebra ===
Rouché&#x27;s theorem can also be used to give a short proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Let
formula_23
and choose formula_24 so large that:
formula_25
Since formula_26 has formula_27 zeros inside the disk formula_28 (because formula_29), it follows from Rouché&#x27;s theorem that formula_30 also has the same number of zeros inside the disk.

One advantage of this proof over the others is that it shows not only that a polynomial must have a zero but the number of its zeros is equal to its degree (counting, as usual, multiplicity).

Another use of Rouché&#x27;s theorem is to prove the open mapping theorem for analytic functions. We refer to the article for the proof.

== Symmetric version ==
A stronger version of Rouché&#x27;s theorem was published by Theodor Estermann in 1962. It states: let formula_31 be a bounded region with continuous boundary formula_2. Two holomorphic functions formula_33 have the same number of roots (counting multiplicity) in formula_1, if the strict inequality
formula_35
holds on the boundary formula_36

The original version of Rouché&#x27;s theorem then follows from this symmetric version applied to the functions formula_37 together with the trivial inequality formula_38 (in fact this inequality is strict since formula_39 for some formula_40 would imply formula_41).

The statement can be understood intuitively as follows.
By considering formula_42 in place of formula_43, the condition can be rewritten as formula_44 for formula_45.
Since formula_46 always holds by the triangle inequality, this is equivalent to saying that formula_47 on formula_2, which in turn means that for formula_40 the functions formula_50 and formula_51 are non-vanishing and formula_52.

Intuitively, if the values of formula_53 and formula_43 never pass through the origin and never point in the same direction as formula_55 circles along formula_2, then formula_50 and formula_51 must wind around the origin the same number of times.

== Proof of the symmetric form of Rouché&#x27;s theorem ==
Let formula_59 be a simple closed curve whose image is the boundary formula_2. The hypothesis implies that &quot;f&quot; has no roots on formula_2, hence by the argument principle, the number &quot;Nf&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of zeros of &quot;f&quot; in &quot;K&quot; is
formula_62
i.e., the winding number of the closed curve formula_63 around the origin; similarly for &quot;g&quot;. The hypothesis ensures that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is not a negative real multiple of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) for any &quot;z&quot; = &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), thus 0 does not lie on the line segment joining &quot;f&quot;(&quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) to &quot;g&quot;(&quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)), and
formula_64
is a homotopy between the curves formula_63 and formula_66 avoiding the origin. The winding number is homotopy-invariant: the function
formula_67
is continuous and integer-valued, hence constant. This shows
formula_68

<doc id="1141152" wikidata="Q2532841" url="?curid=1141152" title="Acacians">
<text>The Acacians (), or perhaps better described as the Homoians (from gr. hómoios) or Homoeans (), were a non-Nicene branch of Christianity that dominated the church during much of the fourth-century Arian Controversy. They declared that the Son was similar to God the Father, without reference to substance (essence). Homoians played a major role in the Christianization of the Goths in the Danubian provinces of the Roman Empire.

&quot;Though Homoian Arianism derived from the thought both of Eusebius of Caesarea and of Arius, we cannot with confidence detect it before the year 357, when it appears in the Second Sirmian Creed.&quot;

== Supporters ==
Homoian theology “was a development of the theology of Eusebius of Caesarea.”

* “Homoian Arianism derived from the thought both of Eusebius of Caesarea and of Arius.”
* &quot;Akakius of Caesarea is usually regarded as the leader of the Homoian Arians &quot;par excellence.&quot; He succeeded Eusebius as bishop of that see in 339 or 340 and remained there for at least twenty-five years. He was clearly a devoted disciple of his predecessor.&quot; Hanson refers to Eusebius of Caesarea as “Akakius&#x27; master.”

“Eusebius of Caesarea, the historian and theologian” “attended the Council of Nicaea in 325,”” was “universally acknowledged to be the most scholarly bishop of his day,”” and “was the most learned and one of the best-known of the 300-odd bishops present” at Nicaea.”

But when the first Homoian Creeds was formulated, Eusebius was dead and Akakius an important leader.

R.P.C. Hanson stated, &quot;If we are to determine who among the Homoian Arians was the most influential in the long run, we must choose Ulfilas, Apostle of the Goths.&quot; “He translated most of the Bible into Gothic.”

== Theology ==

=== Anti-Nicene ===
Homoian theology is specifically anti-Nicene. Particularly, it opposes all ousia-language. They were “refusing to allow ousia-terms of any kind into professions of faith.” (RW, 234) For example, the Sirmian Manifesto (AD 357) said, concerning the ousia-terms: There &quot;ought to be no mention of any of them at all, nor any exposition of them in the Church, and for this reason and for this consideration that there is nothing written about them in divine Scripture and that they are above men&#x27;s knowledge and above men&#x27;s understanding.&quot; (Athan., De Syn., xxviii; Soz., ii, xxx; Hil., De Syn., xi)

=== Anti-Arius ===
Homoian theology also opposed Arius because it opposed the key aspect of Arius’ theology “that the Son was created by the Father &#x27;out of non-existence&#x27;.” For example, the creed of the council of Ariminum anathemized those who say “that the Son is from nothing, and not from God the Father.&quot;

=== The incomparability of God ===
The main pillar of Homoian doctrine is “the incomparability of God the Father.” (RH, 563) They had “a long list of texts … to demonstrate the incomparability of the Father.&quot; For example:

* Invisible - “Christ is the visible God (the Father being the invisible God).&quot;
* Immortal - “Christ is not the immortal God (for he is mortal, that is capable of in some sense encountering death, in contrast to the Father who is immortal).”
* Ingenerate (exists without cause) - &#x27;We confess … one God, not two gods, for we do not describe him as two ingenerates.&quot;

=== A Suffering God ===
The Homoian system was designed to avoid “the risk of saying that the Father suffered.&quot; “But they were perfectly ready to say that God the Son suffered. Indeed, their Christology was specifically designed to do so.&quot; “Here, they were on stronger ground than the pro-Nicenes, whose Christology … always wanted to avoid of concluding that the full, authentic Godhead suffered.&quot;

=== Christ as subordinate ===
“A drastic subordination of the Son to the Father had been the keynote of this school of thought.&quot;

“The Son is eternally … subordinated to the Father,” even after everything is completed that must be done for our salvation.

“It is characteristic of this type of Arianism to teach that the Father is the God of the Son.” Therefore, the Son “worships the Father.&quot;

=== Christ as divine ===
But they did refer to the Son as &quot;God&quot;. For example, they described Him as &quot;God from God.&quot; However, &quot;they pointed out that the word &#x27;god&#x27; in the Bible was in several places applied to beings much inferior to God Almighty (and was therefore applicable in a reduced sense to Christ), e.g., Exod 7:1, Ps 82(81):6.&quot;

&quot;In the intellectual climate of the fourth century, it was quite logical to maintain that the Son was God or divine while not being fully equal to the Father.&quot;

=== The Holy Spirit ===
“The status of the Spirit in Homoian teaching is emphatically short of divine.” “The Holy Spirit is created, and this certainly implies that, unlike the Son, he is not God.” The Spirit “is … not to be worshipped nor adored.&quot;

For example, “Ulfilas&#x27; doctrine exhibits a drastic subordination of the Son to the Father, a fierce emphasis upon the incomparability of the Father … a denial of the divinity of the Holy Spirit and a strong and explicit repudiation of the pro-Nicene doctrine.”

== Homoian creeds ==
As stated, Homoian theology is particularly anti-Nicene and anti-ousia-language. During the first 25 years after Nicaea in 325, nobody mentioned or used or defended the Nicene Creed or ousia language:“For nearly twenty years after Nicaea, nobody mentions homoousios, not even Athanasius. This may be because it was much less significant than either later historians of the ancient Church or modern scholars thought that it was.” “After Nicaea homoousios is not mentioned again in truly contemporary sources for two decades. … It was not seen as that useful or important.” “What is conventionally regarded as the key-word in the Creed homoousion, falls completely out of the controversy very shortly after the Council of Nicaea and is not heard of for over twenty years.” (Hanson Lecture)For that reason, during that period, there were also no anti-Nicene creeds or statements:“Many of the theologies we have considered so far are non-Nicene more than anti-Nicene: only in the 350s do we begin to trace clearly the emergence of directly anti-Nicene accounts.”The first sign of an anti-Nicene doctrine was the creed of Sirmium 351:

* “Sirmium 351 had not only omitted &quot;ousia&quot; language, but positively condemned some uses of that language.”
* “Most significant of all, perhaps, is the appearance of anathemas directly and explicitly aimed at N.” “This creed marks a definite shift towards a more sharply anti-Nicene doctrine.”

“The confession of 357 [the third Council of Sirmium] even more strongly argues against ousia language, condemning use of it,” saying, “there should be no mention of it whatever, nor should anyone preach it.” “This text demonstrates … the emergence of ‘Homoian’ theology.”

The two main Homoian Creeds are “the Second Sirmian Creed of 357” and “the Creed of Nice (Constantinople) (of 360).” “The creed of Nice-Constantinople … was temporarily registered as ecumenical in 360.”

== Biblical language ==
The Homoians were committed to use only Biblical language and declared the Son to be similar () to God the Father, without reference to essence or substance.

* “The Arians tended … to avoid allegorising. … They tend to take Scripture literally.”
* “They prided themselves on their appeal to Scripture. … they pointed out that homoousios and ousia did not occur in the Bible. &#x27;We do not call the Holy Spirit God … because Scripture does not call him (so)’.”
* “Truth is discovered not from argument but is proved by reliable proof-texts.”

“The Homoian Arians … were not particularly interested in philosophy:”“The theologians of the fourth century … use the terminology of Greek philosophy. … It was never accepted by the Homoian Arians).”Consequently, they rejected all ousia-terms, including homoousion (same in substance), homoi-ousion (similar substance), and heter-ousion (different substance).

== Dominant view ==
The Homoian view dominated during much of the Arian Controversy:

=== Eusebius of Caesarea ===
Lewis Ayres identifies “the Eusebians” as one of the four “trajectories” when the Arian Controversy began. Homoian theology, since it was a development of the Eusebians’ theology (see above), already existed when the Nicene Creed was formulated. At that time, most bishops held to the &quot;Eusebian&quot; view:For example, the delegates to the Nicene Council of 325 were &quot;drawn almost entirely from the eastern half of the empire” and the Dedication Creed of 341, which has &quot;Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea and Asterius&quot; as its &quot;ancestors,” &quot;represents the nearest approach we can make to discovering the views of the ordinary educated Eastern bishop.”

=== Rise to dominance ===
“The Homoian group came to dominance in the church in the 350s” (RH, 558–559.) “Homoian Arianism is a much more diverse phenomenon, more widespread and in fact more longlasting.”

Throughout the Arian Controversy, the church&#x27;s Doctrine of God was decided by the Roman Emperors:“If we ask the question, what was considered to constitute the ultimate authority in doctrine during the period reviewed in these pages, there can be only one answer. The will of the Emperor was the final authority.”Similarly, Homoian theology continued to dominate under emperors Constantius and Valens:

* “Homoian Arians … had obtained power under Constantius from 360 to 361 and under Valens from 364 onwards.”
* “By 366 Valens the supporter of Homoian Arianism ruled in the East and Valentinian, the Western Emperor, was keeping as far as possible neutral in religious matters.”
* “The Emperor in the East, Valens, … was a fanatical opponent of the pro-Nicenes, as also of the Eunomians, and a supporter of the Homoian creed.”
Homoian theology continued to dominate until Theodosius became emperor and outlawed all non-Trinitarian branches of Christianity with the Edict of Thessalonica:“When Theodosius had entered Constantinople in November 380 he had given the Homoian Demophilus the chance to remain as bishop if he subscribed to Nicaea. When he did not he was exiled.”

=== Continuation after 381 ===
Marta Szada wrote:“Frequently, studies focusing on the fourth-century Trinitarian controversy stop at the 380s and emphasize the importance of the Council of Constantinople and the Council of Aquileia in 381, and the end of Italian rule of the last Homoian emperor, Valentinian II. In very common interpretation, these events mark the virtual end of the Latin Homoianism … In the present paper … I argue that the Latin Homoian Church survived long into the fifth century and had an active role in the process of converting the Goths into the Homoian Christianity.”

== Intermediate positions ==

R.P.C. Hanson discusses on pages 592-595 “a shift of emphasis on the part of Germinius as far as doctrine is concerned” which illuminates the disputes in Arian circles at the time. Germinius was “appointed bishop of Sirmium in 351” and regarded by some as “one of the standard-bearers of Arianism.” He wrote:“There is one true God the Father, eternal, almighty; and Christ his only Son and our Lord God … born before all things, in deity, love, majesty, power, glory, love, wisdom, knowledge, like in all things to the Father …”“This profession of faith caused alarm … among other Homoian Arian bishops.” “The Catholic faith declared at Ariminum&quot; read “that the Son is like the Father according to the Scriptures.” Homoians did not want to say that “he is like &#x27;according to substance&#x27;” or even “in all respects.” “To adopt such doctrines would be to return to the false teaching of Basil (of Ancyra) condemned at Ariminum.” (See, Homoi-ousianism)

But Germinius defended his views in response to the criticism and wrote:“Christ the Son of God our Lord like in all respects to the Father I ingenerateness excepted. God from God, Light from Light.”Hanson concludes: “Clearly Germinius had by now abandoned Homoian Arianism.”

==Development of Homoian theology in the 350s==
Traditionally, homoousios is regarded as the key term in the Nicene Creed. For example:In the “centuries-old account of the Council of Nicaea: … The whole power of the mysterious dogma is at once established by the one word &quot;homoousios&quot; … with one pronouncement the Church identified a term (homoousios) that secured its … beliefs against heresy.”But, as stated under Homoian Creeds above, during the 20–25 years after Nicaea, nobody mentions the term. However, in the 350s, Athanasius made the Nicene Creed, and the homoousios in particular, part of his polemical strategy. In this way, Athanasius brought the term back into the Controversy:“Athanasius’ engagement with Marcellus in Rome seems to have encouraged Athanasius towards the development of” “an increasingly sophisticated account of his enemies;” “the full flowering of a polemical strategy that was to shape accounts of the fourth century for over 1,500 years;” “a masterpiece of the rhetorical art.”

“During the 350s Athanasius honed his polemic.”

“Athanasius&#x27; decision to make Nicaea and homoousios central to his theology has its origins in the shifting climate of the 350s.”Athanasius&#x27; use of the term homoousios was being progressively accepted in the West and was used to attack the Eusebians. In response, the anti-Nicene creeds and Homoian theology developed in the late 350s. See - Homoian Arianism.

==Sirmian manifesto of 357==
“In the year &quot;357&quot; a small council met at Sirmium and produced a creed which was of great significance.” (RH, 343) Since it was formulated in the West, “the creed was originally written in Latin.” (RH, 343)

“In most older presentations, ‘western’ bishops were taken to be natural and stalwart defenders of Nicaea throughout the fourth century.” (LA, 135) It may, therefore, be surprising to find that the manifesto, issued after this Western meeting in Sirmium in 357, “is clearly Arian in its drastic, consistent and determined subordination of the Son to the Father.” (RH, 346) It said, for example: &quot;There is no uncertainty about the Father being greater. … This is catholic doctrine, that there are two Persons &quot;(personas)&quot; of the Father and the Son, and that the Father is greater.&quot; (RH, 344-5)Furthermore, “it attacks N [the Nicene Creed] … directly and openly.” (RH, 347) For example, it says:&quot;As for the fact that some, or many, are concerned about substance &quot;(substantia)&quot; which is called, ousia &quot;in&quot; Greek, that is, to speak more explicitly, homousion&quot;,&quot; or homoeusion as it is called, there should be no mention of it whatever.&quot; (RH, 344-5)Ossius was the chairperson of the Council of Nicaea. However, “Ossius signed it (the Sirmian manifesto).” (RH, 346)

Lewis Ayres concludes:

* “The East/West or Greek/Latin division which is often used as a primary dividing marker between varieties of fourth- and fifth-century Trinitarian theology is of far less significance than is usually thought.” (LA, 6)
* “Some writers still persist in assuming that theologies in the early fourth century can be divided between east and west, the westerners resolutely ‘beginning’ from the unity of God, easterners somehow naturally prone to a more diverse account of Father, Son, and Spirit.” Ayres describes this as “nonsensical.” (LA, 52)

== Councils of 359 and 360 ==

After a number of preliminary conferences accompanying an inevitable campaign of pamphleteering in which Hilary of Poitiers took part, the bishops of the Western portion of the Empire met at Ariminum towards the end of May, and those of the East at Seleucia Isauria in the month of September, 359. The theological complexion of both Synods was identical, at least in this, that the party of compromise, represented at Seleucia by Acacius and at Ariminum by Ursacius and Valens, was politically, though not numerically, in the ascendant and could exercise a subtle influence which depended almost as much on the argumentative ability of their leaders as on their curial prestige. In both councils, as the result of dishonest intrigue and an unscrupulous use of intimidation, the Homoian formula associated with the name of Acacius ultimately prevailed.

==Influences and decline==
It was Acacius and his followers who had managed the whole proceeding from the outset. By coming forward as advocates of temporizing methods, they had inspired the Eusebian or Semi-Arian party with the idea of throwing over Atius and his Anomoeans. As they had proved themselves in practice all through the course of the unlooked-for movement that brought them to the front, so were they now, in theory, the exponents of the Via Media of their day.

The Acacians separated themselves from the Athanasians and Niceans, by the rejection of the word &quot;homoousios&quot;; from the Semi-Arians by their surrender of the &quot;homoiousios&quot;; and from the Aetians by their insistence upon the term homoios.

They retained their influence as a distinct party just so long as their spokesman and leader Acacius enjoyed the favour of Constantius. Under Julian the Apostate, Atius, who had been exiled as the result of the proceedings at Seleucia, was allowed to regain his influence. The Acacians seized the occasion to make common cause with his ideas, but the alliance was only political; they threw him over once more at the Synod of Antioch held under Jovian in 363.

In 365 the Semi-Arian Synod of Lampsacus condemned Acacius. His theological ideas were considered too extreme by the Semi-Arians. He was deposed from his seat, and with that event the history of the party to which he had given his name, in all practicality, ended.

<text>Saint Acacius of Sebaste (; died 304) was a 4th-century Christian priest and hieromartyr who lived in Sebaste, Armenia, during the Diocletianic Persecution. 

== Biography ==
Under the governor Maximus (284–305) seven women and two children were brought to justice in Sebaste. The women were accused of having tempted their husbands to become Christians. They did not lose their dignity even under the harsh torture. One of the executioners, Irenarchus, was so impressed by their attitude to their faith that he joined them. It was the priest Acacius who administered the baptism of Irenarchus. All of them suffered of torture and were killed by the sword or the stake. 

== Veneration ==
They are venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and their feast day is on 27 November.

This Acacius should not be confused with the soldier Acacius, one of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste.

<doc id="1141158" wikidata="Q610757" url="?curid=1141158" title="Homosociality">
<text>In sociology, homosociality means same-sex relationships that are not of a romantic or sexual nature, such as friendship, mentorship, or others. Researchers who use the concept mainly do so to explain how men uphold men&#x27;s dominance in society.

&quot;Homosocial&quot; was popularized by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in her discussion of &quot;male homosocial desire&quot;. Sedgwick used the term to distinguish from &quot;homosexual&quot; and to connote a form of male bonding often accompanied by fear or hatred of homosexuality. Jean Lipman-Blumen had earlier (1976) defined homosociality as a preference for members of one&#x27;s own sex – a social rather than a sexual preference.

The opposite of homosocial is heterosocial, describing non-sexual relations with the opposite sex.

== Empirical evidence ==
In a study presented by Rose, males and females between the ages of 20 and 28 were examined on their evaluations of same- and cross-sex friendships. Results showed a preference for same-sex relationships in both men and women. Cross-sex relationships were evaluated by men and women to be less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships, and friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well.

Depending on the culture, and family, and social structures, same-sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old. (LaFreniere, Strayer,&amp; Gauthier, 1984; Jacklin&amp; Maccoby, 1978; Harkness &amp; Super, 1985). LaFreniere, Strayer, and Gauthier (1984) conducted a three-year-long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 and 6 years old, 98 boys and 93 girls. As they looked into sex segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exhibit these preferences around 3–4 years old. However, in a study by Harkenss and Super, Kenyan children were not found to have sex-preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn&#x27;t occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased. &quot;Just when and how such gender segregation appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche&quot; (Harkness &amp; Super, 1985).

It appears that the social bias towards members of one&#x27;s own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1992). That is, young girls favor other females (girls and women) over males (boys and men). The findings are identical for young boys. Moreover, a study done by Carol Martin (1989) found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a &quot;tomboy&quot; than a boy depicted as a &quot;sissy&quot;; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a &quot;sissy&quot;. This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender-incongruent behavior. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to adhere to and appreciate the social expectations for males—devaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10–12 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys.

== Sexual orientation ==

Homosociality, by definition, implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual. The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Some feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism, and lesbian desire, with Audre Lorde stating &quot;the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.&quot;

==Historical uses==

Homosociality is a term sometimes used in discussions of the all-male world of knightly life in medieval culture. It is also used for historically largely male occupations such as being a sailor (for example, historian Marcus Rediker uses the term to describe the pirate world). Homosocial relationships are not obliged to be sexual relationships; they are merely same-sex social interactions.

Predominantly homosocial arrangements include:
*Single-sex educational institutions
**Men&#x27;s colleges and Women&#x27;s colleges
*Fraternities and sororities
*Madrassas
*Monasteries, convents, and other cloistered religious societies
*Military (historically exclusively male, although presently both sexes are accepted in some forces) 
*Prisons
*Yeshivot
*Harems, Purdah
*Public baths
*Sports club teams, particularly geared toward single-sex membership or to one unique all-male or all-female sport 
*Exclusive male clubs or female clubs
*Historically, sailing-ships were often homosocial, manned by all-male crews of sailors, officers, merchants, etc. 

Generally, the more polarized the gender roles and restrictive the sexual code, the more homosociality one expects to find in a society.

==Study==

===Feminist theory===

Feminist scholars such as Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Heidi Hartmann and others have emphasized the role of male homosociality in perpetuating perceived patterns of male dominance in the workplace. Kanter has explored &quot;metaphorical &#x27;homosocial reproduction&#x27; - how men attempt to reproduce their dominant power relations by only uniting with and sharing the same occupational space and privilege with those males&quot; who resemble them - although &quot;subsequent research has suggested some revisions of Kanter&#x27;s underlying argument...[re] &#x27;homosocial reproduction&#x27;&quot;. Timothy Laurie has criticized how &quot;homosociality&quot; is used in the sociology of masculinity, noting that &quot;much extant research on [homosociality] retains the premise that men innately seek identification and communication with other men. The mysterious malepolitik is thus privileged over men&#x27;s relationships to femininity, or women&#x27;s relationships to masculinity&quot;. In terms of specific studies, Karen Gabriel offers a useful mapping of the working of homosociality in the context of India.

===Homosociality and homosexuality===

There is further controversy regarding the relationship between homosociality and homosexuality: &quot;how, if at all, male homosociality is connected to male homosexuality is one of the key questions posed by scholars in the field&quot;. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick identifies a continuum between homosociality and homosexuality, going as far as correlating feminism and lesbian desire. This approach has been compared to Adrienne Rich&#x27;s concept of the &quot;lesbian continuum.&quot;

At the same time, Sedgwick &quot;defines male homosociality as a form of male bonding with a characteristic triangular structure. In this triangle, men have intense but nonsexual bonds with other men, and women serve as the conduits through which those bonds are expressed&quot;. Sedgwick&#x27;s analysis of &quot;the love triangle in which two men appear to be competing for a woman&#x27;s love...develops René Girard&#x27;s claim that such a triangle may disguise as rivalry what is actually an attraction between men&quot;. Girard argued that &quot;the homosexual drift stems logically from the fact that the model/rival is a man&quot;, producing at times a &quot;noticeably increased preponderance of the mediator and a gradual obliteration of the [female] object&quot;.

Research at the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society (ARCSHS), La Trobe University, has found that mutual identification over heterosexual activity is often the medium through which male homosocial bonding is enacted.

== Bromance ==
In popular culture, the word &quot;bromance&quot; has recently been used to refer to an especially close homosocial yet non-sexual relationship between two men. Bromance is most often used in the case of two heterosexual partners, although there have been prominent celebrity gay-straight bromances (also known as homomances or hobromances). The female equivalent is a womance.

<text>Adalard of Corbie (; c. 751, Huise – 2 January 827) was the son of Bernard who was the son of Charles Martel and half-brother of Pepin; Charlemagne was his cousin. He is recognised as a saint within the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Biography==
Adalard received a good education in the Palatine School at the Court of Charlemagne in Aachen, and while still very young was made Count of the Palace. At the age of twenty, he entered the monastery at Corbie in Picardy, a monastery that had been founded by queen Bathild, in 662. In order to be more secluded, he went to Monte Cassino, but was ordered by Charlemagne to return to Corbie, where he was elected abbot. At the same time, Charlemagne made him prime minister to his son Pepin, King of Italy, in the Carolingian Empire. As a high court administrator, he attended some meetings that discussed military planning. His &quot;De ordine palatinii&quot; discusses in some detail a well-developed intelligence system by the end of Pepin&#x27;s reign. At his death in Milan in 810, Pepin appointed Adalard tutor to his son Bernard of Italy, then but twelve years of age.

When, in 817, Bernard, son of Pepin, aspired to the imperial crown, emperor Louis the Pious suspected Adalard of being in sympathy with Bernard and banished him to Hermoutier, the modern Noirmoutier, on the island of the same name. Adalard&#x27;s brother Wala was obliged to become a monk at Corbie. After seven years Louis saw his mistake and made Adalard one of his chief advisers.

Several hospitals were erected by him. In 822 Adalard and his brother Wala founded Corvey Abbey (&quot;New Corbie&quot;) in Westphalia. Corvey was an imperial abbey; its territory extended from the bishopric of Paderborn to the duchy of Brunswick. Its abbot was one of the eleven abbots, who sat with twenty-one bishops in the imperial diet at Regensburg.

Adalard was returning from Corvey to old Corbie when he fell sick three days before Christmas: he died about three in the afternoon, on January 1 in the year 827, at the age of seventy-three.

Shortly after his death, the &quot;Vitae Adalhardi&quot; was written by Paschasius Radbertus, who admired Adalhard greatly. 

==Veneration==
Adalard is honoured as patron saint of many churches and towns in France and along the lower Rhine.

<doc id="1141175" wikidata="Q404099" url="?curid=1141175" title="Máedóc of Ferns">
<text>Saint Máedóc of Ferns (;  6th &amp; 7th century), also known as Saint Aidan (; ; and &#x27;),Saint MadocorSaint Mogue&quot;&#x27; (), was an Irish saint who was the first Bishop of Ferns in County Wexford and the founder of thirty churches. His birth name was Áed, the name of the Irish god of the underworld, meaning &quot;fire&quot;. The name Aidan is a diminutive form of Aed or Aodh, and was also a form of the Latin name Dominus. Máedóc and Mogue are other pet forms of Aed or Aodh, formed from the Irish affectionate prefix &quot;mo-&quot; and the diminutive suffix &quot;-óg&quot;, meaning &quot;young&quot;, making for something like &quot;my dear little Aodh&quot;.

==Life==
Áed was born c. 558 at Inisbrefny (an island in Templeport Lake), in the area then known as Magh Slécht, now the parish of Templeport, County Cavan. In the Welsh genealogies of the saints, Aeddan is called the son of Gildas or Aneurin, sons of Caw, king of Strathclyde; Irish sources make him a son of Sedna, a chieftain of Connaught and his wife Eithne and a first cousin of St. Dallán Forgaill. These separate origins, his work in Wales, the extraordinary span of Aidan&#x27;s activity, and the appearance of two dates of death has led some scholars—such as Sabine Baring-Gould—to propose that the existing stories of Maedoc are a conflation of two separate Aeds, one Welsh and one Irish, who served as Bishop of Ferns a generation apart. There is also confusion of these Aeds with Aed mac Bricc, who preceded them and possibly participated in the cursing of Tara with Saint Ruadhán.

Irish legend says that the &quot;Bell of St. Mogue&quot; was given to the infant on his birth by Saint Caillín. When a boat could not be found to take the infant Aedan across the lake to where Caillín waited to baptize him, Aedan was floated to shore on a slab of stone. The font at St Mogue&#x27;s in Bawnboy is said to be made from part of the stone. As a youth, Aedan was a hostage of Ainmuire mac Sétnai of the Cenél Conaill, High King of Ireland. Ainmire was so impressed with Aedan that he told him he could stay or go. Aedan said he would go, but only if the other hostages were also released, whereupon Ainmire let them all return home. He studied at the great school of Saint Finnian at Clonard Abbey. While at Clonard, Aedan made friends with Molaise, who would later found the monastery of Devenish Island on the River Erne.

By this point, many began to come to the young man desiring to become his disciples. Instead of indulging them, he fled from Ireland to Wales to study under St. David. Welsh legends place his upbringing with David and go into detail concerning attempts on his life by David&#x27;s steward. Along with Saint Cadoc, he was said to have exterminated an army of Saxons or Irishmen by rolling stones upon their camp in a narrow valley. He was listed in the Welsh triads as one of David&#x27;s three most faithful disciples. He returned to Ireland in 570, landing on the coast of Wexford with hives of honey bees, which he had been told were scarce on the island. He landed as some locals were plundering another group of strangers and his quick response impressed the local chieftain, who granted him lands for religious communities. He then settled at Brentrocht in Leinster. Aidan is said to have fasted for seven years, during this period he ate only barley bread with water.

Aidan seems to have played a role in the king of Leinster&#x27;s defeat over the Uí Néill High King Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill at the Battle of Dún Bolg in 598, either (according to the hagiographers) through the intercession of his prayers or (according to the poets of the &quot;Bóroma Laigen&quot;) through a failed peace embassy followed by the successful idea to sneak Leinster&#x27;s soldiers into the enemy camp inside food baskets. However the Aidan, Bishop of Glendalough, referred to in the tale is unlikely to have been St. Máedóc as they had different mothers. Maedóc&#x27;s mother was Eithne while Aidan&#x27;s mother was Bríg, daughter of Chobtaig m. Crimthann mac Énnai m. Énnae Cennsalach of the Uí Ceinnselaig dynasty from Leinster. 

The grateful King Brandubh then granted him Ferns in County Wexford, where he established a monastery. The influence of Brandubh also convened a synod whereat Ferns was not merely constituted a see but its bishop Aedan was also given nominal supremacy over the other Leinster bishops as their Chief Bishop (). He was noted for his benevolence and hospitality: on one occasion, seeing them exhausted by their journey, he permitted beef to be given to a visiting delegation of British bishops during Lent and permitted them to excuse themselves with the claim that the slaughtered cow was merely &quot;milk and vegetables in condensed form&quot; whereas the whey and biscuits the other monks consumed had so many weevils as to occasion &quot;conscientious scruples&quot;. On another, he was pushed into a lake to see whether he would lose his temper; upon his meekly restoring himself, his tormenter confessed himself and apologized.

Aeddan himself died on 31 January 632 on Lough Melvin&#x27;s shore in County Leitrim. His relics are claimed by St. Edan&#x27;s in Ferns. His stone tomb is inside the cathedral, although his remains are in the original cathedral crypt below. The Breac Maodhóg (his shrine) dates from the 9th century and is an example of an early medieval reliquary. It was often used as a sacred object upon which to swear binding oaths. It was acquired by the National Museum of Ireland in the 1890s.

==Miracles==
Many miracles are recorded of St. Maedoc during his sojourn in Wales. He was said to have broken a jug while fetching ale for his fellow monks; making the sign of the cross over the shards, however, it was repaired and he continued on his errand. A yoke given to him by David&#x27;s steward purposefully too small to fit the necks of his oxen miraculously accommodated them and permitted him to bring the necessary materials for Llanddewi Velfrey. Following his return to Ireland, a local begged him for some meal as he was grinding flour and, after receiving some, disguised himself as a blind man to come back and beg for more. Annoyed, the saint cursed him that the generations of his descendants would never lack a blind member. Another time, wolves devoured a calf at one of his monasteries; its mother being inconsolable, Aedan blessed the head of his cook and told him to offer it to the heifer, which licked him and thenceforth &quot;loved him like a calf&quot;. When asked by Saint Fintan Munnu to heal monks suffering under an epidemic, Aedan was said to have indulged him: first by curing the monks and then by permitting the sickness to resume when Saint Fintan changed his mind, considering the sickness to be good for their souls. His hagiographers credited Aidan&#x27;s curses with Brandubh&#x27;s defeat of the Uí Néill; they further state that, when Sarán slew his father-in-law, he attempted to accommodate the saint only for Aidan to curse him that his right hand would wither to the stump. When Sarán begged for a penance, Aidan directed him to pray for forgiveness at Brandubh&#x27;s tomb in Ferns; when Sarán did so, a voice from the crypt forgave him. He lost his hand regardless. Miraculous blessings from Aidan were credited with King Brandubh&#x27;s victory at Dún Bolg in 598; with the selection of his successor Dachua (Mochua Luachra); and with the success of the Irish architect Gobán Saor. His heirs to Rosinver Abbey in County Leitrim and Drumlane Abbey in County Cavan were the Connachta noblemen Fearghus Mac Ailill and Faircheallaigh Mac Ailill.

==Legacy==

He is the patron saint of Hy Kinsellagh or Wexford; Ferns; and Templeport in County Cavan. His feast is commemorated in Bawnboy with prayerful visits to his church and to the island where he was born. The names Mogue and Aidan are popular for people in the West Cavan area. 
The Catholic episcopal seat formerly located at Ferns (prior to its destruction) is now at St. Aidan&#x27;s Cathedral in Enniscorthy, although the bishop resides at Wexford. The Anglican diocese is administered from Kilkenny, although St. Edan&#x27;s Cathedral in Ferns remains the seat of Church of Ireland diocese (itself part of the United Dioceses of Cashel and Ossory). Saint Áedan&#x27;s is located on the site (and partially includes the ruins) of the earlier Catholic cathedral, which was burnt down in 1575 by the O&#x27;Byrnes of Wicklow. It was ordered to be rebuilt by Queen Elizabeth I during her reign, but was only half rebuilt.

Aedan is credited as the founder of thirty churches and a number of monasteries. The first of these monasteries was on the island of his birth, now the site of 18th-century ruins and burial ground. The clay or mortar from the ruins of the church is said to provide protection against fire or drowning and is kept by many local people in their homes. Other monasteries include Drumlane (near Milltown in County Cavan); at Ferns in County Wexford; at Dissert-Nairbre in County Waterford; and at Rosinver near the site of his death. In Wales he founded Saint Madoc of Ferns church in Haroldston West, Pembrokeshire. The church of Llawhaden, also in Pembrokeshire, Wales, commemorates him near the site of a ford he supposedly discovered while leading his oxen.

<text>The Sitwells (Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, Sacheverell Sitwell), from Scarborough, North Yorkshire and the family seat of Renishaw Hall, were three siblings who formed an identifiable literary and artistic clique around themselves in London in the period roughly 1916 to 1930. This was marked by some well-publicised events, notably Edith&#x27;s &quot;Façade&quot; with music by William Walton, with its public debut in 1923. All three Sitwells wrote; for a while their circle was considered by some to rival Bloomsbury, though others dismissed them as attention-seekers rather than serious artists.

==&quot;Wheels&quot; anthologies==

The first Sitwell venture was the series of &quot;Wheels&quot; anthologies produced from 1916. These were seen either as a counterweight to the contemporary Edward Marsh &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthologies, or as light &#x27;society verse&#x27; collections. They did not really match the Imagist anthologies of the same years, or the modernist wing, in terms of finding poets with important careers ahead of them, but included both Nancy Cunard and Aldous Huxley.

==Legacy==
Wood End, the former family home of the Sitwells in Scarborough has been redeveloped into a &quot;creative industries centre&quot; providing artists&#x27; workspace as well as administrative and learning spaces. Weston Hall in Northamptonshire, owned by the Sitwell family, was sold in 2021.

A large collection of the Sitwells&#x27; papers reside at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at The University of Texas, Austin.

<text>Giles of Assisi (; 1190 – 1262), was one of the original companions of Francis of Assisi and holds a leading place among them. St. Francis called him &quot;The Knight of our Round Table&quot;.

==Life==
Of Giles&#x27; origins and early life nothing certain is known, other than that he was a simple farmer. In April, 1209, moved by the example of two leading fellow-Assisians, who had already become the first followers of Francis, he begged permission to join the little band, and on the feast of St. George (23 April) was invested in a poor religious habit which Francis had begged for him. Almost immediately afterwards he set out with Francis to preach in the Marches of Ancona. He accompanied Francis to Rome when the first Rule was approved orally by Pope Innocent III, and appears to have then received the monastic tonsure. 

About 1212 Giles made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. James at Compostella, in Spain. Shortly after his return to Assisi he started for Jerusalem, to venerate the Holy Places, visiting on his way home the Italian shrines of St. Michael, at Monte Gargano, and Saint Nicholas, at Bari. He is next found in Rome and still later at Tunis.

In these journeys Giles was always at pains to procure by manual labor what food and shelter he needed. At Ancona he made reed baskets; at Brindisi he carried water and helped to bury the dead; at Rome he cut wood, trod the wine-press, and gathered nuts; while the guest of a cardinal at Rieti he insisted on sweeping the house and cleaning the knives. He said: &quot;Happiness is to do bodily labor for the love of the Most High and not to take any lesser wages than Paradise for the good work one does.&quot;

A keen observer of people and events, Giles acquired in the course of these travels much valuable knowledge and experience, which he turned to good account. He took every opportunity to preach to the people. His sermons were brief and heartfelt talks, replete with homely wisdom; he never minced his words, but spoke to all with apostolic freedom. After some years of activity Giles was assigned by Francis to the hermitage of Monteripido, outside Perugia, where he began a life of contemplation and ecstasy which continued until his death. 

Giles was a stranger to theological and classical learning, but engaged in constant contemplation of heavenly things. Men of all social classes were drawn to Perugia to hear Giles teach. The answers and advice these visitors received were remembered, talked over, and committed to writing, and thus was formed a collection of the familiar &quot;Dicta&quot; or &quot;Sayings&quot; of Giles. Bonaventure held these &quot;Sayings&quot; in high esteem, and they are cited in the works of many subsequent ascetical writers. They are short, pithy, popular counsels on Christian perfection, applicable to all classes. Known for their mysticism, humanity, and originality, they faithfully reflect the early Franciscan spirit and teaching.

It was in 1262, on the fifty-second anniversary of his reception into the Order of Friars Minor, that Giles died, already revered as a saint. His immemorial cultus was confirmed by Pope Pius VI in 1777, and his feast day is celebrated on the 23 April.

<doc id="1141184" wikidata="Q4531809" url="?curid=1141184" title="Óengus of Tallaght">
<text>Óengus mac Óengobann, better known as Saint Óengus of Tallaght or Óengus the [[Culdee]], was an Irish bishop, reformer and writer, who flourished in the first quarter of the 9th century and is held to be the author of the &quot;Félire Óengusso&quot; (&quot;Martyrology of Óengus&quot;) and possibly the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;.

Little of Óengus&#x27;s life and career is reliably attested. The most important sources include internal evidence from the &quot;Félire&quot;, a later Middle Irish preface to that work, a biographic poem beginning &quot;Aíbind suide sund amne&quot; (&quot;Delightful to sit here thus&quot;) and the entry for his feast-day inserted into the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;.

==Background==

Óengus was known as a son of Óengoba and grandson of Oíblén, who is mentioned in a later genealogy as belonging to the Dál nAraidi, a ruling kindred in the north-east of Ireland. A late account prefaced to the Martyrology asserts that Óengus was born in Clúain Édnech/Eidnech (Clonenagh, Spahill, County Laois, Ireland), not far from the present town of Mountrath, and brought up at the monastic school founded there by Fintan of Clonenagh, where also his body was buried. The claim may be spurious since the &quot;Félire&quot; itself accords no such importance to the monastic foundation or its patron saint Fintan.

Óengus describes himself as a cleric in the &quot;Félire&quot;, using the more humble appellation of &quot;pauper&quot; (&quot;pauperán&quot; and &quot;deidblén&quot; in Old Irish). He was an important member of the community founded by Máel Ruain at Tallaght (now in South Dublin), in the borderlands of Leinster. Máel Ruain is described as his mentor (&quot;aite&quot;, also &quot;foster father&quot;). Óengus is first described as a bishop in a list of saints inserted into the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;.

==Writings==

===&quot;Félire Óengusso&quot;===

The literary effort most commonly attributed to Óengus is the Old Irish work known as &quot;Félire Óengusso&quot; (&quot;Martyrology of Óengus&quot;), which is the earliest metrical martyrology — a register of saints and their feast days – to have been written in the vernacular. The work survives in at least ten manuscripts, the earliest being Leabhar Breac of the early 15th century.

The martyrology proper consists of 365 quatrains, one for each day of the year, and is framed between a lengthy prologue and epilogue. Later scribes added a prose preface, including material on Óengus, and accompanied the text with abundant glosses and scholia. Óengus&#x27;s principal source was the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;, an abbreviated version in prose of the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot;, but with a multitude of Irish saints added to their respective feast days. Other sources are given in the epilogue as an &quot;antigraph of Jerome, the martyrology of Eusebius&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s host of books.&quot;

====Dating the calendar====

The precise date of the original composition has proved difficult to ascertain. The usual method of determining a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; has been to argue from the careers of saints and kings referred to in the text, many of whom remain obscure. The &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is a different game. In view of the selective nature of the &quot;Félire&quot;, arguments from silence have little to recommend it, at least in individual cases. What would have been instructive, the year of Óengus&#x27;s death, is unknown, but his education by Máel Ruain (d. 792) must at least mean that he did not outlive the 9th century.

The one thing that is usually accepted is that it was written no earlier than 797, when one of the rulers described in the prologue as having deceased, Donnchad mac Domnaill, king of Tara, died. Rudolf Thurneysen postulated a date before 808 on grounds that the reference to the death of Bran Ardchenn mac Muiredaig (d. probably 795), king of Leinster, should be attributed to political sympathies in the reign of his successor Fínsnechta mac Cellaig (d. 808).

Ó Riain, however, has rejected the traditional date (797 x 808) in favour of a later range, between 828 and 833, while more recently, Dumville has cast doubt on Ó Riain&#x27;s conclusions and dating methods. First, Ó Riain argues that such sympathies as Thurneysen refers to are pertinent only to the next kings in the royal line, Cellach mac Brain (r. 829–834) and Conchobar mac Donnchada (r. 819–833), sons of Bran and Donnchad respectively. Dumville objects that this political argument glosses over the probability that while Bran and Donnchad gave way to overlords from rival dynasties, they were nevertheless succeeded by members of their family in their own &quot;tuatha&quot; or &quot;mórthuatha&quot;. The inclusion of these kings in the prologue, therefore, offers no good reason to move up the &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;. Second, Ó Riain sees reason to identify the saints Airerán (11 August), Modímóc (10 December) and Flann (14 January) with Airfhinnán (d. 803), abbot of Tallaght, Dímmán of Araid (d. 811) and Flann mac Fairchellaig (d. 825), abbot of Lismore. Dumville, however, points out several weaknesses and concludes with Stokes &quot;that no saint or other person who certainly died in the ninth century is mentioned.&quot; Third, having identified a number of saints in the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;, the primary model for the &quot;Félire&quot;, he proposes obits extending to that of Teimnén or Temnán of Linn Duachaill, who died in 828. In Dumville&#x27;s view, the evidence is ambiguous, since the relationship of the extant copies of the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot; to the lost original which served as the source for the &quot;Félire&quot; is yet unclear. Liam Breatnach has also supported Thurneysen&#x27;s date.

====Centres of worldly and spiritual power====

Something of Óengus&#x27; view on secular politics appears to come through in his prologue to the &quot;Félire&quot;. In several stanzas, the deserted sites of Tara, Crúachan (also Crúachu) and Emain Machae are interpreted as the former sites of fortresses in which powerful rulers resided before the coming of Christianity. These pagan seats of power are contrasted with the great ecclesiastical centres of Ireland which were flourishing in Óengus&#x27; own time, such as Armagh and Clonmacnoise. According to the historian T.M. Charles-Edwards, Óengus was responding to the military domination of overlords of his day, commenting that worldly glory is transient, while spiritual power is enduring. To similar effect, Óengus also holds up the example of Máel Ruain, who continues to offer support and comfort after his death, against that of the contemporary warrior-kings Donnchadh and Bran Ardchenn, whose strong exercise of power meant no such thing after theirs.

===&quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;===

It has been suggested that Óengus was actively involved in the compilation if not the composition of the augmented &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;. This was a work of Northumbrian provenance, probably from Lindisfarne, which first passed through Iona and Bangor, where Irish scribes began to make some additions. The manuscript (now lost) finally arrived in Tallaght, where it received the majority of its Irish additions. It was written by someone of Óengus&#x27;s learning and literary skill at Tallaght and there are strong indications that this was Óengus himself: first of all, the sources named by Óengus in the epilogue to the &quot;Félire&quot; (see above) would make more sense if these were the materials used for the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;; second, a number of saints whom the same epilogue claims to have included are found in the Martyrology of Tallaght, but not in the actual &quot;Félire&quot;.

==Death==

According to the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;, Óengus&#x27;s feast day, and hence the date of his death, is 11 March. The poem beginning &quot;Aíbind suide sund amne&quot; claims that he died on a Friday in Dísert Bethech (&quot;The Birchen Hermitage&quot;). Together, these have produced a range of possible dates such as 819, 824 and 830, but pending the dates of the martyrologies, no conclusive answer can be offered. His metrical &quot;Life&quot; tells that he was buried in his birthplace Clonenagh.

==Reputation==

Becoming a hermit, he lived for a time at -beagh, where, on the banks of the Nore, he is said to have communed with the angels. From his love of prayer and solitude, he was named the &quot;Culdee&quot;; in other words, the &quot;Ceile Dé&quot;, or &quot;Servant of God.&quot; Not satisfied with his hermitage, which was only a mile from Clonenagh, and, therefore, liable to be disturbed by students or wayfarers, Óengus removed to a more solitary abode eight miles distant. This sequestered place, two miles southeast of the present town of Maryborough, was called after him &quot;the Desert of Óengus&quot;, or &quot;Dysert-Enos&quot;. Here he erected a little oratory on a gentle eminence among the Dysert Hills, now represented by a ruined and deserted Protestant church. He is also claimed to have founded Dísert Óengusa near to Croom, c. AD 780. Two of the reformed communities of Tallaght, monasteries in County Limerick and County Laois founded in Óengus&#x27;s lifetime, are known as Dísert Óengusa (&quot;Óengus&#x27;s Hermitage&quot;).

His earliest biographer in the ninth century relates the wonderful austerities practised by Óengus in his &quot;desert&quot;, and though he sought to be far from the haunts of men, his fame attracted a stream of visitors. The result was that the good saint abandoned his oratory at Dysert-Enos, and, after some wanderings, came to the monastery of Tallaght, near Dublin, then governed by Máel Ruain. He entered as a lay brother, concealing his identity, but Máel Ruain soon discovered him and collaborated with him on the Martyrology of Tallaght.

<doc id="1141191" wikidata="Q3021265" url="?curid=1141191" title="Affinity (Catholic canon law)">
<text>In Catholic canon law, affinity is an impediment to marriage of a couple due to the relationship which either party has as a result of a kinship relationship created by another marriage or as a result of extramarital intercourse. The relationships that give rise to the impediment have varied over time. Marriages and sexual relations between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as incest.

Today, the relevant principle within the Catholic Church is that &quot;affinity does not beget affinity&quot;—i.e., there is no affinity between one spouse&#x27;s relatives and the other spouse&#x27;s relatives. Canon 109 of the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; of the Catholic Church provides that affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple, and is a relationship which &quot;arises from a valid marriage, even if not consummated, and exists between a man and the blood relatives of the woman and between the woman and the blood relatives of the man.&quot; Also, affinity &quot;is reckoned in such a way that the blood relations of the man are related by affinity to the woman in the same line and the same degree, and vice versa.&quot;

==Historical development==
===Mosaic law===

In the Hebrew Bible, and contain prohibitions of sexual relations between a couple in a consanguineous relationship, as well as a number of prohibitions of certain affinity relationships, e.g., (father&#x27;s wife), (father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife), (brother&#x27;s wife), (wife&#x27;s sister), (father&#x27;s wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one&#x27;s mother or father) and (brother&#x27;s wife). Marriage to a brother&#x27;s widow is prohibited, but not to a deceased wife&#x27;s sister. However, as an exception, requires a brother to marry his brother&#x27;s widow if the brother died without issue, in a so-called levirate marriage.

===Roman law===
Roman civil law prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. However, the rule was that, if an issue of affinity arose, at whatever consanguineal level a couple was joined was considered the same level as regarded affinity. Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an unemancipated daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved. Slaves, as such, could not contract a legal marriage, but if freed were then subject to the general rules. Also, a marriage contracted within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity if contracted &quot;bona fide&quot;, out of ignorance of any impediments, is allowed to stand and any children of this union were considered legitimate.

===Historical Catholic canon law===
Regarding itself as not being bound by Old Testament commandments, the early Christian church followed Roman civil law, as the law of the land. The Christian emperors modified the rules from time to time and extended the civil law impediment to the first degree of collateral affinity. The church extended the impediment to relationships created by illicit intercourse. The Council of Elvira (), prohibited the marriage of a widower with his deceased wife&#x27;s sister. The prohibition became slowly more extensive. By the early 9th century, the Western Church had increased the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from four to seven. The method of calculating relationships was also changed to simply count the number of generations back to a common ancestor. The church also prohibited affinity to the same seven degrees. While the impediment of affinity is close to but not as compelling as that of consanguinity, the reasoning behind the prohibited degrees of affinity being treated the same as that of consanguinity is the nearness to the blood relatives by the very act of sexual intercourse.

Prior to the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), the Church recognized two additional forms of affinity. Firstly, when a man married a widow, her relatives as well as those of her former husband were considered the man&#x27;s relatives and treated as if they were his blood relatives. Secondly, if the woman&#x27;s first husband had been a widower then the blood relatives of his first wife became the woman&#x27;s relatives and, by her subsequent marriage, were also the new husband&#x27;s relatives by affinity. Also, a woman&#x27;s children by a deceased husband, as well as the children of her husband by a deceased wife, were considered related by affinity. So the subsequent marriages of step-siblings carried the same prohibitions as if they were related by blood. The principle established was &quot;affinity begot affinity.&quot;

The Fourth Lateran Council removed the second type of affinity rule and the new axiom became: &quot;affinity does not beget affinity&quot;, which is the principle followed in the modern Catholic Church. It also limited both affinity and consanguinity prohibitions to the fourth degree, but retained the same method of calculating, counting back to a common ancestor. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) limited the impediment to marriage on account of affinity in cases when the affinity is created outside of marriage (e.g., by force or extra-matrimonial intercourse) to the second degree of affinity.

===Dispensation===
As the affinity rules have their origin in ecclesiastical and not divine law, impediments can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. The Pope or a bishop may grant a dispensation to a marriage when the affinity rules would be breached.

==Contemporary Christian positions==
The current canon law of the Latin Church holds in Canon 1092 that affinity in any degree of the direct line invalidates marriage, such as between a father-in-law and his daughter-in-law, or between a mother-in-law and her son-in-law. However, the code does not prohibit marriages between people related by affinity in the collateral line, allowing a widow or widower to marry the sibling or first cousin of their deceased spouse. The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches of the Eastern Catholic Church holds in Canon 809 that affinity invalidates marriage in the direct line in any degree, and also in the collateral line to the second degree, thus prohibiting someone from marrying their sibling-in-law without first receiving a dispensation.

The modern laws of the Anglican Church regarding affinity are found in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, which were revised from time to time. The Deceased Wife&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Marriage Act 1907 removed the impediment to marrying a late wife&#x27;s sister. Restrictions were also relaxed by the Marriage Act 1949 s. 1 and the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees of Relationship) Act 1986 s. 1. The Anglican Communion allows marriages beyond the second degree of affinity.

The Eastern Orthodox Church relationship prohibitions because of affinity follow (father&#x27;s wife), (father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife), (brother&#x27;s wife), (wife&#x27;s sister), (father&#x27;s wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one&#x27;s mother or father) and (brother&#x27;s wife). However, the Greek patriarchs and bishops may grant dispensations with a certain degree of freedom or choose to adhere to the letter of the law. The Church of the East has few restrictions on affinity begetting affinity. The Armenian Apostolic Church restricts affinity to the fourth degree, while the policy of Oriental Orthodoxy in general is very close to that of the Roman Catholic canons. Conservative Lutherans also prohibit marriage within close degrees of affinity, even if not specifically outlawed by the state.

<text>Azymite (from Ancient Greek &quot;ázymos&quot;, unleavened bread) is a term of reproach used by the Eastern Orthodox Church since the eleventh century against the Latin Church, who, together with the Armenians and the Maronites, celebrate the Eucharist with unleavened bread. Some Latin controversialists have responded by assailing the Greeks as &quot;Fermentarians&quot; and &quot;Prozymites&quot;.

The canon law of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church mandates the use of unleavened bread for the Host, and unleavened wafers for the communion of the faithful. On the other hand, most Eastern churches explicitly forbid the use of unleavened bread (Greek: &quot;azymos artos&quot;) for the Eucharist. Eastern Christians associate unleavened bread with the Old Testament and allow only for bread with yeast, as a symbol of the resurrection of Christ (since yeast is the agent that gives rise to bread). Indeed, this usage figures as one of the three points of contention that traditionally accounted as causes (along with the issues of Petrine supremacy and the &quot;filioque&quot; in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) of the Great Schism of 1054 between Eastern and Western churches.

==Azymes==
&quot;Azymes&quot; (plural of &quot;azyme&quot;) is an archaic English word for the Jewish matzah, derived from the Ancient Greek word ἄζυμος (ἄρτος) &quot;ázymos (ártos)&quot;, &quot;unleavened (bread)&quot;, for unfermented bread in Biblical times; the more accepted term in modern English is simply unleavened bread or matzah, but cognates of the Greek term are still used in many Romance languages (Spanish &quot;pan ácimo&quot;, French &quot;pain azyme&quot;, Italian &quot;azzimo&quot;, Portuguese &quot;pão ázimo&quot; and Romanian &quot;azimă&quot;). The term does not appear frequently in modern Bible translations, but was the usual word for unleavened bread in the early Catholic English Douay–Rheims Bible.

==History==
The Western Church has always maintained the validity of consecration with either leavened bread or unleavened bread. Whether the bread which Jesus used at the Last Supper was leavened or unleavened is the central question giving rise to this issue. Various arguments exist for which kind was used. Regarding the usage of the primitive Church, knowledge is so scant, and the testimonies so apparently contradictory, that many theologians have pronounced the problem incapable of definitive solution.

In the ninth century the use of unleavened bread had become universal and obligatory in the West, while the Greeks, desirous of emphasizing the distinction between the Jewish and the Christian Pasch, continued the exclusive offering of leavened bread. Photius made no use of a point of attack which occupies a prominent place in later Orthodox polemics. The western explanation is that Photius saw that the position of the Latins could not successfully be assailed. Two centuries later, the quarrel with Rome was resumed by a patriarch who was not deterred by this consideration. As a visible symbol of Catholic unity, it had been the custom to maintain Greek churches and monasteries in Rome and some of Latin Rite in Constantinople. The issue became divisive when the provinces of Byzantine Italy which were under the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople were forcibly incorporated into the Church of Rome following their invasion by the Norman armies, said churches which were forced by Rome to use unleavened bread.

In response, Michael Cerularius ordered all the Latin churches in the Byzantine capital to be closed, and the Latin monks to be expelled.

Patriarch Michael Cerularius was responding to a concrete situation within his territory – the persecution of the Byzantine Italians in southern Italy, the closing of their churches, the prohibition of their Rite, the removal of their bishops and the imposition of the Latin unleavened bread for the Eucharist. This enforced change in the Byzantine provinces of southern Italy (which brought about the extinction of the Byzantine traditions there) caused anti-Italian riots in Constantinople; the Patriarch subsequently closed the Latin churches in the imperial city.

As a dogmatic justification of this act, the Patriarch advanced the novel tenet that the unleavened oblation of the &quot;Franks&quot; was not a valid Mass. The proclamation of war with the Pope and the West was drawn up by his chief lieutenant, Leo of Achrida, metropolitan of the Bulgarians. It was in the form of a letter addressed to John, Bishop of Trani, in Apulia, at the time subject to the Byzantine emperor, and by decree of Leo the Isaurian attached to the Eastern Patriarchate. John was commanded to have the letter translated into Latin and communicated to the Pope and the Western bishops. This was done by the learned Benedictine, Cardinal Humbert, who happened to be present in Trani when the letter arrived. Baronius has preserved the Latin version; Cardinal Hergenröther discovered the original Greek text:

This validity of the etymological reasoning with the terms &quot;artos&quot; from &quot;airo&quot; was and is disputed. The Latin divines found a number of passages in Scripture where unleavened bread is designated as &quot;artos&quot;. Cardinal Humbert recalled the places where the unleavened loaves of proposition are called artois. In the &quot;Septuagint&quot;, one can find the expression &quot;άρτους αζύμους&quot; [artous azymous] in Exod. 29:2.

Cerularius found the issue politically useful in his conflict with the Latins. In popular opinion, the flour and water wafers of the &quot;Franks&quot; were not bread; their sacrifices were invalid; they were Jews not Christians. Their lifeless bread could only symbolize a soulless Christ; therefore, they had clearly fallen into the heresy of Apollinaris. The controversy became a key factor in producing the East–West Schism, which persists to this day. This question of azyms brought forth a cloud of pamphlets, and made a deeper impression on the popular imagination than the abstruse controversy of the Filioque. But it caused little or no discussion among the theologians at the Councils of Lyons and Florence. At the latter Council the Greeks admitted the Latin contention that the consecration of the elements was equally valid with leavened and unleavened bread; it was decreed that the priests of either rite should conform to the custom of their respective Church.

Modern Russians have claimed for their nation the initiation of the azymes controversy; but the treatises ascribed to Leontius, Bishop of Kiev, who lived a century earlier than Cerularius, and in which all the well-known arguments of the Greeks are rehearsed, are judged to have proceeded from a later pen.

<text>Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue (August 1932 – 4 February 2024), also known as Lois O&#x27;Donoghue and Lois Smart, was an Australian public administrator and Indigenous rights advocate. She was the inaugural chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) from 1990 to 1996. She is known for her work in improving the health and welfare of Indigenous Australians, and also for the part she played in the drafting of the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;, which established native title in Australia.

O&#x27;Donoghue was the inaugural patron and namesake of the Lowitja Institute, a research institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing established in 2010, which in 2022 established the Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue Foundation.

The Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue Oration is held annually by the Don Dunstan Foundation, in her honour.

==Early life and education==
Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue, whose birth was unregistered, was born in August 1932, and later assigned the birthdate of 1 August 1932 by missionaries. She was born on a cattle station later identified in her official biography as De Rose Hill in the far north of South Australia (now in the APY Lands, not far from Iwantja). She was the fifth of six children of Tom O&#x27;Donoghue, a stockman and pastoral lease holder of Irish descent, and Lily, an Aboriginal woman whose tribal name was Yunamba. Lily was a member of the Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal clan of northwest South Australia. Lowitja was baptised by a pastor from the United Aborigines Mission.

Tom O&#x27;Donoghue had joined his older brother Mick in central Australia in 1920, and broke horses at Granite Downs until 1923 when he was granted a pastoral lease at De Rose Hill. After the birth of Eileen in 1924, Tom and Lily had another five children up to 1935. Mick O&#x27;Donoghue had two boysParker and Stevewith an Aboriginal woman called Mungi. Mick handed the boys over to missionaries of the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) at Oodnadatta before they turned four years of age. In March 1927, Tom O&#x27;Donoghue handed his first two childrenthree-year-old Eileen and the infant Geoffreyto the UAM at Oodnadatta, and the following month the mission moved south to Quorn in the Flinders Ranges, where the mission, named the Colebrook Home, was established in a cottage above the town.

In September 1934, aged two years, Lowitja was removed from her mother, and handed over to the missionaries at the Colebrook Home (on behalf of South Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal Protection Board), along with her four-year-old sister Amy, and her six-year-old sister Violet. Upon arrival at the home, Lowitja met her other siblings, now ten-year-old Eileen and eight-year-old Geoffrey. The missionaries called her Lois and gave her a date of birth of 1 August 1932. They also assigned a place of birth. She had no memory of any time spent with her parents as an infant. She later (sometime after 1994) changed her name back to Lowitja.

According to O&#x27;Donoghue, she was very happy living at Colebrook and said she received a sound education both there and at the Quorn Primary School. The Quorn community at large actively encouraged children from the home to participate in local events, and assisted in the maintenance of the home. Only a few people objected to the integration. In 1944 Colebrook Home moved to Eden Hills, South Australia, due to chronic water shortages, enabling her to attend Unley High School, a local public school, and obtain her Intermediate Certificate. She was taught up until the Leaving Certificate standard but did not sit for the examination.

After the publication of the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report in 1997, she said she preferred the word &quot;removed&quot; to the word &quot;stolen&quot; (as used in Stolen Generations) for her personal situation. She was the youngest child in her family, and was two years old when she was removed from her mother. After she was removed, she did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her family had been taken.

At the age of 16 she was sent to work as a domestic servant for a large family at Victor Harbor.

==Nursing==
After two years of working as a servant in Victor Harbor, O&#x27;Donoghue worked as a nursing aide in the seaside town and did some basic training. She then applied to be a student nurse in Adelaide. After a long struggle to win admission to train at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), including lobbying the premier of South Australia (Thomas Playford) and others in government, in 1954 she became a nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (one source claims she was the first Aboriginal person to become such). In 1994 she said: &quot;I&#x27;d resolved that one of the fights was to actually open the door for Aboriginal women to take up the nursing profession, and also for those young men to get into apprenticeships&quot;.

She remained at RAH for ten years, after graduating in 1958 being promoted first to staff sister and then to charge nurse.

In 1962 O&#x27;Donoghue went to work for the Baptist Overseas Mission working in Assam, northern India, as a nurse relieving missionaries who were taking leave back in Australia. Due to the nearby Sino-Indian War she was advised by the Australian government to evacuate to Calcutta, from where she would depart for her return to Australia. She was &quot;probably the first part-aborigine to be appointed
from Australia to an overseas mission&quot;.

==Public service==
After returning in 1962, she worked as an Aboriginal liaison officer with the South Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Education. She later transferred to the SA Department of Aboriginal Affairs and was employed as a welfare officer based mainly in the north of the state, in particular at Coober Pedy. There, in the late 1960s, she learnt of her true name, Lowitja, and also that her mother was living in poor conditions in Oodnadatta.

In 1967 O&#x27;Donoghue joined the Commonwealth Public Service as a junior administrative officer in an Adelaide office of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs.

Around 1973-4 she was appointed as regional director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in South Australia, the first woman to hold a position like this in a federal government department. In this role she was responsible for the local implementation of national Aboriginal welfare policy.

After a short while she left the public service and had various management/administrative roles with non-government organisations. She was then appointed by the government as chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission.

==Other roles and activities==
As part of her battle to be accepted for training as a nurse at the Royal Adelaide in 1954, O&#x27;Donoghue met white Aboriginal advocate Charles Duguid, and joined the Aborigines&#x27; Advancement League of South Australia.

She campaigned for a Yes vote in the 1967 referendum.

From 1970 to 1972, she was a member of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement.

In 1977, after the restructuring of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (established by the Whitlam government in 1973) into the National Aboriginal Conference, O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed founding chairperson of the new organisation, created by the Commonwealth Government.

In 1990, O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), a position she held until 1996. Attending a cabinet meeting in 1991, she used the occasion to put forward ATSIC&#x27;s position with regard to the government&#x27;s response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Her leadership in this position was greatly respected and admired. She was replaced as chairperson of ATSIC by Gatjil Djerrkura, who was considered by the Howard government to be more moderate.

In 1992 she received an SA Great Award.

In December 1992, O&#x27;Donoghue became the first Aboriginal Australian to address the United Nations General Assembly during the launch of the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Peoples (1993).

Following the 1992 Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia, O&#x27;Donoghue was a leading member of the team negotiating with the federal government relating to native title in Australia. Together with prime minister Paul Keating, she played a major role in drafting the bill which became the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;, and Keating shortlisted her for the position of Governor-General of Australia in 1995, which ultimately went to Sir William Deane.

On 29 April 1998, she delivered the Australian Library Week Oration at Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute in Adelaide, win which she stressed the importance of high quality library and information services to Indigenous Australians.

On 24 January 2000, O&#x27;Donoghue was the first Indigenous person to give the annual national address as part of Australia Day celebrations.

In 2000, O&#x27;Donoghue chaired the Sydney Olympic Games National Indigenous Advisory Committee. She was a member of the Volunteers Committee for the games, and carried the Olympic torch through Uluru.

In 2008, prime minister Kevin Rudd asked her for advice during his preparation for the Apology to the Stolen Generations.

She was the patron of a number of health, welfare, and social justice organisations over the years, including Reconciliation South Australia, the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre at the University of South Australia, the Don Dunstan Foundation, and CATSINaM (Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives).

==Recognition and honours==
In the 1976 Australia Day Honours, O&#x27;Donoghue became the first Aboriginal woman to be inducted into the new Order of Australia founded by the Labor Commonwealth Government. The appointment, as a Member of the Order (AM) was &quot;for service to the Aboriginal community&quot;.

In 1982 she won an Advance Australia Award.

O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1983 New Year Honours for service to the Aboriginal community, and was named Australian of the Year in 1984, for her work to improve the welfare of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

In 1995, the Royal College of Nursing, Australia awarded her an honorary fellowship, and in 1998 she was awarded an honorary fellowship from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

In 1998 she was declared an National Living Treasure.

O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 1999 Australia Day Honours, &quot;for public service through leadership to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the areas of human rights and social justice, particularly as chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&quot;.

O&#x27;Donoghue was inducted into the Olympic Order in 2000.

In 2005 or 2006, O&#x27;Donoghue was invested as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great (DSG) by Pope John Paul II.

In 2009 she received the NAIDOC Lifetime Achievement Award.

In May 2017, O&#x27;Donoghue was one of three Indigenous Australians, along with Tom Calma and Galarrwuy Yunupingu, honoured by Australia Post in the 2017 Legends Commemorative Stamp &quot;Indigenous leaders&quot; series to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum.

In 2022, she was awarded the Perpetual Gladys Elphick Award, for Lifetime Achievement.

==Lowitja Institute==
The Lowitja Institute is a national research centre known as a Cooperative Research Centre or CRC, focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. It was established in January 2010 and named in honour of its patron.

The Lowitja Institute Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health CRC (also known as the Lowitja Institute CRC), funded by the Australian Government&#x27;s Cooperative Research Centres programme, was part of the Institute until 30 June 2019. The history of this and the whole Lowitja Institute dates from the first CRC, the CRC for Aboriginal and Tropical Health (CRCATH), which was founded in Darwin in 1997 with Lowitja as inaugural chair. Based on its success, two further CRCs were funded by the government: CRC for Aboriginal Health (CRCAH, 2003–2009), followed by the CRC for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (CRCATSIH, 2010–2014), this time hosted by the new Lowitja Institute. The Lowitja Institute CRC developed three research programmes and conducted workshops.

Both the Institute and the CRCs have led reform in Indigenous health research, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people determining the outcomes.

, there are 12 member organisations of the Lowitja Institute, including AIATSIS, the Australian Indigenous Doctors&#x27; Association (AIDA), Flinders University, the Menzies School of Health Research, the Healing Foundation and the University of Melbourne. Directors of the Institute include June Oscar, Pat Anderson, and Peter Buckskin.

The Institute provides project grants for up to three years to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations or groups undertaking research focused on improving Indigenous health and wellbeing. The main requirement is that the research aligns with the themes of the Lowitja Institute Research Agenda of empowerment, sovereignty, connectedness, and cultural safety in the healthcare setting.

===Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue Foundation===
On 1 August 2022, the day on which O&#x27;Donoghue celebrated her 90th birthday, the Lowitja Institute announced the establishment of the Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue Foundation. The Foundation is a charitable organisation which seeks funding for scholarships to assist Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people to pursue nursing studies or to work in the public service sector; and to build an archive and educational resources relating to O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s life and achievements.

==Marriage and personal life==
In 1979 O&#x27;Donoghue married Gordon Smart, a medical orderly at the Repatriation Hospital, whom she had first met in 1964. He died in 1991 or 1992. He had six adult children from a previous marriage, but they had no children together.

She cited Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Tutu, Don Dunstan, and Paul Keating as having provided inspiration to her, and also praised the Fraser government for having passed the &quot;Land Rights Act&quot; in 1976.

Featured on ABC Television&#x27;s &quot;Compass&quot; in 1997, O&#x27;Donoghue said that she felt &quot;angry about the policy that removed us and also took away our culture, took away our language and took away our families... [and] about the mission authorities for not in fact keeping in touch with my mother and at least sending her some photographs so she could know that we were OK and what we looked like&quot;.

==Later life, death and legacy==
O&#x27;Donoghue retired from public life in 2008, and in her later years was cared for by her family on Kaurna land in South Australia.

On 4 February 2024 her family announced in a statement she had died in Adelaide. O&#x27;Donoghue was 91.

On 8 March 2024, a state funeral was held in St Peter’s Cathedral in North Adelaide, which was attended by prime minister Anthony Albanese, Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney, governor-general of Australia David Hurley, South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas, and governor of South Australia Frances Adamson, Lowitja Foundation chair Pat Anderson, and hundreds of relatives, friends, and supporters. Oscar played tribute to her &quot;enormous contribution&quot;, saying &quot;Dr O&#x27;Donoghue had an extraordinary lifelong career of service [and] she played a leading role in many of the major political movements across her long lifetime&quot;.

<doc id="1141206" wikidata="Q829732" url="?curid=1141206" title="Allied Command Europe Mobile Force">
<text>The Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (AMF) was a small NATO quick reaction force, headquartered at Heidelberg, Germany, active from 1960 to 2002. It formed part of Allied Command Europe (ACE), headquartered at SHAPE at Casteau, Belgium. The land component of the force, consisting of a brigade-sized formation of about 5,000 personnel, was composed of units from 14 NATO states.

HQ CO US AMF(L) Infantry was at Coleman Barracks, Mannheim, GE 95-02, HQ AMF (L) was at Sullivan Barracks, Mannheim, 1975–1991 and Turley Barracks, Mannheim, 1991–1995.

==ACE Mobile Force (Land)==
The ACE Mobile Force-Land or AMF(L) was intended as a multinational force that could be quickly despatched to any part of ACE&#x27;s command area - from North Norway, to Germany, to eastern Turkey - to demonstrate the solidarity of the alliance and its ability to resist all forms of aggression against any member state. During the Cold War the AMF-L did frequent exercises in North Norway and in other areas. The Bundeswehr responded to the request of NATO from December 9, 1960, from January 1961 to provide a paratrooper battalion, a medical company, an airborne telecommunications company, and air transport units.

In October 1961 Bundeswehr units, including parts of the 1st Airborne Division (the Parachute Battalion 262) in the AMF in October 1961 in Sardinia during Exercise First Try in part, on the Belgian, British and American soldiers were also involved. In November 1965, the Parachute Battalion 262 took part in the AMF maneuver Eastern Express II on the southeast flank of NATO, which took place in Turkey under the leadership of the AMF commander Major General Michael Fitzalan-Howard (UK). In total, 3,500 soldiers from the US, UK, Belgium, Germany and Italy participated in the maneuvers. In 1967 the maneuver Sunshine Express in Greece, also with German participation.

In 1970 at Narvik in northern Norway on the north flank of NATO, the AMF United maneuver Arctic Express with 4000 soldiers.

It was first deployed operationally in 1991 during the Gulf War, when part of its air component was dispatched to watch the Turkish borders, in the face of a potential threat to a member&#x27;s territory.

The AMF(L) was one of the NATO formations deployed to Norway during Exercise Strong Resolve 1998.

The AMF(L) formed the core of the Albania Force (AFOR), a NATO-led international force responsible for establishing and delivering humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo in Albania during the Kosovo crisis in 1999. It was led by Major General John Reith, Commander AMF(L).

The Immediate Reaction Task Force (Land) (IRTF-L) was a novel command and control concept successfully developed and evaluated by the AMF(L) between 1999 and 2001. The IRTF(L) concept allowed the AMF(L), an existing Immediate Reaction Force multinational brigade HQ, to command a divisional sized force with minimal augmentation and no intermediate HQs. The trial concluded in December 2001.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2002 that NATO had to disband the ACE Mobile Force, &#x27;..after Britain withdrew its contribution to ensure troops were available to join any US attack on Iraq. Britain&#x27;s contribution to [the force] included key support troops, without which the 6,000-strong force could not operate. With no other NATO member prepared to contribute more soldiers, the alliance had no choice but to disband it.&#x27;

HQ AMF(L) was disbanded on October 31, 2002 and has since been replaced by the NATO Response Force.

<doc id="1141208" wikidata="Q2705017" url="?curid=1141208" title="Independence (mathematical logic)">
<text>In mathematical logic, independence is the unprovability of some specific sentence from some specific set of other sentences. The sentences in this set are referred to as &quot;axioms&quot;.
A sentence σ is independent of a given first-order theory &quot;T&quot; if &quot;T&quot; neither proves nor refutes σ; that is, it is impossible to prove σ from &quot;T&quot;, and it is also impossible to prove from &quot;T&quot; that σ is false. Sometimes, σ is said (synonymously) to be undecidable from &quot;T&quot;. (This concept is unrelated to the idea of &quot;decidability&quot; as in a decision problem.)

A theory &quot;T&quot; is independent if no axiom in &quot;T&quot; is provable from the remaining axioms in &quot;T&quot;. A theory for which there is an independent set of axioms is independently axiomatizable.

==Usage note==
Some authors say that σ is independent of &quot;T&quot; when &quot;T&quot; simply cannot prove σ, and do not necessarily assert by this that &quot;T&quot; cannot refute σ. These authors will sometimes say &quot;σ is independent of and consistent with &quot;T&quot;&quot; to indicate that &quot;T&quot; can neither prove nor refute σ.

==Independence results in set theory==

Many interesting statements in set theory are independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). The following statements in set theory are known to be independent of ZF, under the assumption that ZF is consistent:
*The axiom of choice
*The continuum hypothesis and the generalized continuum hypothesis
*The Suslin conjecture

The following statements (none of which have been proved false) cannot be proved in ZFC (the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice) to be independent of ZFC, under the added hypothesis that ZFC is consistent. 

*The existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals
*The existence of large cardinals
*The non-existence of Kurepa trees

The following statements are inconsistent with the axiom of choice, and therefore with ZFC. However they are probably independent of ZF, in a corresponding sense to the above: They cannot be proved in ZF, and few working set theorists expect to find a refutation in ZF. However ZF cannot prove that they are independent of ZF, even with the added hypothesis that ZF is consistent.

*The axiom of determinacy
*The axiom of real determinacy
*AD+

== Applications to physical theory ==
Since 2000, logical independence has become understood as having crucial significance in the foundations of physics.

<text>Iris Adrian Hostetter (May 29, 1912 – September 17, 1994) was an American stage and film actress.

==Life and career==
Adrian was an only child, born in Los Angeles, California, to Florence (née Van Every) and Adrian Earl Hostetter, who wed in 1909 in Los Angeles. She was raised by her single mother in Los Angeles. She was a graduate of Hollywood High School.

Adrian won a beauty pageant, worked with the Ziegfeld Follies, and performed with Fred Waring before she entered films at the end of the silent era in &quot;Chasing Husbands&quot; (1928) and appeared as an extra or chorus girl in early sound films like &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930).

During the 1930s she specialised in playing hard-boiled gals, glamorous gold-diggers, and gangsters&#x27; &quot;molls&quot;. She played supporting roles in numerous features. She played &quot;Gee-Gee Graham&quot; in &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot;. In the Jerry Lewis comedy, &quot;The Errand Boy&quot;, she played a glamorous movie star &quot;Anastasia Anastasia&quot;, whose on-set birthday party is wrecked by Lewis&#x27;s shenanigans. She appeared on several radio programs, including the &quot;Abbott and Costello Show&quot;.

She acted regularly, albeit without achieving star status, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in more than one hundred films. In her later years she appeared in several Walt Disney films, including &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot;, &quot;The Love Bug&quot;, &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, and &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot;. Disney director Robert Stevenson considered Adrian his &quot;good-luck charm&quot;. In these and other movies (such as &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;), she was typically cast as sharp-tongued or wise cracking waitresses, landladies, and other blue collar neighborhood types. On television, she was a member of the cast of the unsuccessful situation comedy &quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot; in the spring of 1978. She also played numerous guest roles in television series such as &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, and &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;.

==Personal life==
Adrian was married to Charles Over from 1935 to 1936; the marriage ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to George Jay, also ended in divorce. On September 24, 1949, she married Dan Schoonmaker, a camera manufacturer, in Las Vegas. They separated two months later and were divorced on September 14, 1950, in Ciudad Juárez. Her fourth and final marriage was to football player Ray (Fido) Murphy, and lasted more than 30 years until his death in 1983.

Adrian had no children.

==Death==
Adrian died in Los Angeles, as a result of a fall in her home sustained during the 1994 Northridge earthquake eight months earlier. Her ashes are within the Columbarium of Radiant Dawn at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<text>John Diamond, Baron Diamond, PC (30 April 1907 – 3 April 2004), known as Jack Diamond, was a British Labour Party politician.

Diamond was educated at Leeds Grammar School and became an accountant. Diamond became managing director of &quot;Capitol and Provincial News Theatres&quot;. He was elected Member of Parliament in 1945 for the Blackley division of Manchester, but lost it in 1951. In 1946 and 1947, he was parliamentary private secretary to the Ministry of Works. He returned to the House of Commons in a 1957 by-election for Gloucester, caused by the death of its Labour MP, Moss Turner-Samuels.

He served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1964, a cabinet position from 1968, and Privy Councillor from 1965. He represented Gloucester until his surprise defeat in 1970 by the Conservative candidate, Sally Oppenheim.

Diamond was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1965 Birthday Honours, and was created a life peer as Baron Diamond &quot;of the City of Gloucester&quot; on 25 September 1970. In 1981 he left the Labour Party for the new Social Democratic Party (SDP). He led the SDP in the House of Lords from 1982 to 1988 but opposed its merger with the Liberals, associating instead with the Owenite &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP before rejoining Labour in 1995.

==Family==
Diamond was first married in 1932 and had two sons and a daughter. He had a daughter, Joan, by his second wife, Julie Goodman, whom he married in 1948. They separated in 1966 and divorced 10 years later. Upon his death at 96, he was survived by his children and by his third wife, Barbara Kagan, whom he had married in 1976.

<doc id="1141232" wikidata="Q350388" url="?curid=1141232" title="Eumenes III">
<text>Eumenes III (; ; (died 129 BC) originally named Aristonicus; in Greek Aristonikos Ἀριστόνικος) was a pretender to the throne of Pergamon. He led the revolt against the Pergamene regime and found success early on, seizing various cities near the coast of Anatolia, including the island of Samos, and killing the Roman Consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus. However, the revolt was eventually quelled by the Roman Republic in 129 BC when it dispatched the experienced Marcus Perperna to the region.

== Staking his Claim ==
When the Pergamene king, Attalus III, died in 133 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Though he stipulated that Pergamum and the rest of the Greek cities were exempt from this bequest, it mattered little to the Romans, with Tiberius Gracchus in particular eager to take advantage of this gift to fund his ambitious land reforms. As a result of the turmoil that stemmed from Gracchus encroaching on the prerogative of the Senate by attempting to use his power as the Tribune of the Plebs to allocate the bequest to the funding of his new laws, the Romans were slow in securing their claim. Aristonicus, who claimed to be the illegitimate son of the earlier Pergamene king, Eumenes II (197–160 BC), father of Attalus III, took advantage of the uncertainty and laid claim to the throne, taking the dynastic name, Eumenes III.

== Revolt ==
Eumenes’ revolt was met with staunch opposition, coming not only from the Romans but also from the surrounding Greek cities. Indeed, in the earlier stages of the revolt, much of the conflict came against the Greek cities of the Anatolian coast. According to Strabo, Eumenes successfully convinced Leucae to revolt and only left the region after being driven out by defeat to the Ephesians in a naval battle off the coast of Cyme. Before being expelled from the area he had taken Samos, Myndus and Colophon in sea raids, and crucially, the Roman consul dispatched to put an end to his revolt, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, was killed after an attempt to take back Leucae.

Eumenes then sought support in the interior, promising freedom to both slaves and serfs whom he referred to as &#x27;heliopolitae&#x27;. It was the serfs, who comprised most of the workers in the interior, who were more receptive to his message; his ideals failed to take hold in cities, where the slaves were concentrated. However the extent to which he was a social revolutionary or simply a dynastic contender to the throne is uncertain, with desperation rather than a genuine desire at reform perhaps motivating his offer of freedom. Nevertheless, he initially found success in the interior, seizing Thyatira as well as Apollonis. His cause was also furthered by the death of Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, who, along with Mithridates V of Pontus, Nicomedes II of Bithynia, and Pylaemenes of Paphlagonia, opposed the revolt in the hopes of winning the favor of Rome. It was around this time that he was joined by Blossius of Cumae, the Stoic, who had been a supporter of Tiberius Gracchus and promised to found a state called Heliopolis in which all were to be free.

== Downfall ==
Despite these gains, the revolt was dealt a blow in 130 BC by the appointment of Crassus’ successor: Marcus Perperna. The consul had prior experience with putting down slave revolts in Sicily, and the Romans reaped the rewards of this experience as Perperna, according to Justinus, subdued Eumenes in their first encounter. Though the location of this encounter is disputed, it is thought to be Stratonicea on the Caicus in Lydia. Here, the revolt came to an end, with Eumenes being starved into submission and sent, alive, to Rome. His most prominent ally, Blossius, intimately aware of the wrath Rome would bring down upon him, killed himself.

After Eumenes arrived in Rome, he was paraded through the city, then executed by strangulation in the Tullianum prison. Perperna&#x27;s successor in Asia, Manius Aquillius, subsequently oversaw the organisation of the area, dividing the Pergamene kingdom among Rome, Pontus, and Cappadocia.

<text>Jean Baptiste Audebert (1759 – December 1800) was a French artist and naturalist.

==Life==
Audebert was born at Rochefort. He studied painting and drawing at Paris, and gained reputation as a miniature-painter. Employed in preparing plates for the &quot;Histoire des cloportes&quot; of Guillaume-Antoine Olivier, he acquired a taste for natural history. His first original work, &quot;Histoire naturelle des singes&quot; appeared in 1800, illustrated by sixty-two folio plates, drawn and engraved by himself. The coloring in these plates was unusually beautiful, and was applied by a method devised by himself.

His work was also included in the bestselling &quot;Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse&quot;.

Audebert died in Paris, leaving complete materials for another work, &quot;Histoire des colibris, oiseaux-mouches, jacamars et promerops&quot;, which was published in 1802. Two hundred copies were printed in folio, one hundred in large quarto, and fifteen were printed with the whole text in letters of gold. Another work, left unfinished, was also published after the author&#x27;s death, &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des grimpereaux et des oiseaux de paradis&quot;. The last two works also appeared together in two volumes, &quot;Oiseaux dorés, ou à reflets métalliques&quot; (1801-1802), written with his friend Louis Pierre Vieillot. In this work he printed lines of gold and silver over the painted colours of the birds to give them a metallic sheen imitating the iridescent colours of nature.

<doc id="1141234" wikidata="Q1351382" url="?curid=1141234" title="Rack (torture)">
<text>The rack is a torture device consisting of a rectangular, usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one or both ends. The victim&#x27;s ankles are fastened to one roller and the wrists are chained to the other. As the interrogation progresses, a handle and ratchet mechanism attached to the top roller are used to very gradually retract the chains, slowly increasing the strain on the prisoner&#x27;s shoulders, hips, knees, and elbows and causing excruciating pain. By means of pulleys and levers, this roller could be rotated on its own axis, thus straining the ropes until the sufferer&#x27;s joints were dislocated and eventually separated. Additionally, if muscle fibres are stretched excessively, they lose their ability to contract, rendering them ineffective.

==Uses==


It is unclear exactly from which civilization the rack originated, they always would use the earliest examples are from Greece. The Greeks may have first used the rack as a means of torturing slaves and non-citizens, and later in special cases, as in 356 BC, when it was applied to gain a confession from Herostratus, an arsonist who was later executed for burning down the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot; states that Alexander the Great had the pages who conspired to assassinate him, along with their mentor, his court historian Callisthenes, tortured on the rack in 328 BC.

According to Tacitus, the rack was used in a vain attempt to extract the names of the conspirators to assassinate Emperor Nero in the Pisonian conspiracy from the freedwoman Epicharis in 65 A.D. The next day, after refusing to talk, she was dragged back to the rack on a chair (all of her limbs were dislocated, so she could not stand), but strangled herself on a loop of cord on the back of the chair on the way. The rack, in Roman sources, was referred to with the name &quot;equuleus&quot;; the word &quot;fidicula&quot;, more commonly the name of a small lyre or stringed instrument, was used to describe a similar torture device, although its exact design has been lost.

The rack was also used on early Christians, such as St. Vincent (304 A.D.), and mentioned by the Church Fathers Tertullian and St. Jerome (420 A.D.).

===Britain===
Its first appearance in England is said to have been due to John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, the constable of the Tower in 1447, and it was thus popularly known as &quot;the Duke of Exeter&#x27;s daughter&quot;.

The Protestant martyr Anne Askew, daughter of Sir William Askew, Knight of Lincolnshire, was tortured on the rack before her execution in 1546 (age 25). She was so damaged by the torture on the rack that she had to be carried on a chair to her burning at the stake. The accusations against her were from: (1) the Bishop&#x27;s Chancellor Edmund Bonner, who claimed that women were not allowed to speak the Scriptures, and (2) the Bishop of Winchester Stephen Gardiner, because she would not profess that the sacraments were the literal flesh, blood and bone of Christ; this despite the fact that the English Reformation had already begun a decade earlier.

The Catholic martyr Nicholas Owen, a noted builder of priest holes, died under torture on the rack in the Tower of London in 1606. Guy Fawkes is also thought to have been put to the rack, since a royal warrant authorising his torture survives. The warrant states that &quot;lesser tortures&quot; should be applied to him at first, but if he remained recalcitrant he could be racked.

In 1615 a clergyman called Edmond Peacham, accused of high treason, was racked.

In 1628 the question of its legality was raised in connection with a proposal in the Privy Council to rack John Felton, the assassin of George Villiers, the 1st Duke of Buckingham. The judges resisted this, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the laws of England. The previous year Charles I had authorised the Irish Courts to rack a Catholic priest; this seems to have been the last time the rack was used in Ireland.

In 1679 Miles Prance, a silversmith who was being questioned about the murder of the respected magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, was threatened with the rack.

===Russia===

In Russia up to the 18th century the rack (&quot;дыба&quot;, dyba) was a gallows-like device for suspending the victims (strappado). The suspended victims were whipped with a knout and sometimes burned with torches.

<text>Migros () is Switzerland&#x27;s largest retail company, its largest supermarket chain and largest employer. It is also one of the forty largest retailers in the world. It is structured in the form of a cooperative federation (the Federation of Migros Cooperatives), with more than two million members.

It co-founded Turkey&#x27;s largest retailer, also named Migros, which became independent of Migros Switzerland in 1975.

The name comes from the French &quot;mi&quot; for half or mid-way and &quot;gros&quot;, which means wholesale. Thus the word connotes prices that are halfway between retail and wholesale. The logo of the company is a large orange M. Migros is often referred to as &quot;the orange giant&quot; (German: &quot;oranger Riese&quot;, French: &quot;géant orange&quot;, Italian: &quot;gigante arancio&quot;).

==History==
Migros was founded in 1925 in Zurich as a private enterprise by Gottlieb Duttweiler, who had the idea of selling just six basic foodstuffs at low prices to householders who, in those days, did not have ready access to markets of any kind. At first he sold only coffee, rice, sugar, pasta, coconut oil and soap from five lorries that went from one village or hamlet to another. The strategy to cut the intermediate trade and their margins led to the broad resistance of his competitors who goaded the producers to boycott him. As a reaction to this threat, Migros started creating its own line of goods beginning with meat, milk and chocolate.

Duttweiler and his drivers expanded their inventory and, in 1926, the first market opened its doors in Zurich. His second store, in Ticino, presaged the future as it was founded as a cooperative. By 1941, the energetic entrepreneur had built a number of markets but, in that year, he basically gave the business to his customers by transforming everything from his privately owned enterprises into regional cooperatives, headed by the Federation of Migros Cooperatives.

As early as 1935, Duttweiler showed his zest for expansion by founding the Hotelplan travel agency. In 1942, the Migros brand was applied to a weekly magazine, &quot;Wir Brückenbauer&quot; (now known as &quot;Migros Magazine&quot;). Other ventures were restaurants in 1952, filling stations (Migrol) in 1954, language schools (Eurocentres) in 1956, the Migros Bank in 1957 and an insurance company in 1959.

In 1948, the economist Elsa Gasser convinced Duttweiler to introduce the self-service approach in Migros stores, paving the way for the development of Switzerland&#x27;s most successful supermarket chain.

On behalf of the Migros Federation, the Zurich-based Reederei Zürich AG ordered at the &quot;H. C. Stülcken Sohn&quot; shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, the cargo ship &quot;Adele&quot; which was launched on 15 July 1952; the ship was christened by Adele Duttweiler, the wife of Gottlieb Duttweiler.

In 1954 Migros entered the Turkish market, forming Migros Türk in partnership with the Istanbul City Council. This was sold to the Turkish conglomerate Koç Holding in 1975 and is the largest retailer in Turkey. Between 2008 and 2011, Koç Holding sold most of its shares of Migros Türk to BC Partners. It would not be until 1993 for Migros to open another foreign supermarket, this time in Thoiry, near Geneva.

1986 saw Migros&#x27; first recreation park, Säntispark, in Abtwil.

In 1995, Migros introduced its organic label &quot;Migros Bio&quot; (products which follow the Bio Suisse guidelines). In 2017, it added a specific label for organic products containing at least 90% Swiss ingredients (&quot;Migros Bio Suisse&quot;).

In October 2012, Migros expanded in the German market by acquiring the Hessian food store chain Tegut. In the same year, Migros opened the first Swiss store of German organic supermarket chain Alnatura. In 2013, however, the company announced the sale to the REWE retail group of its four Migros-branded stores in Germany, the first of which had established in 1995 in Lörrach, near Basel.

In 2016, Migros announced that it would phase-out free plastic bags at check-out. Migros had tested the measure in the Canton of Vaud since 2013: the measure had reduced the number of plastic bags distributed by ninety percent (and saved 100,000 francs per year). Migros was the first to introduce the measure across the country, on 1 November 2016. The company also announced that profits from the remaining sale of plastic bags would be invested in environmental projects.

=== Philosophy ===
Gottlieb Duttweiler was concerned about the health of his customers and decided that Migros would not sell any alcoholic beverages nor any tobacco. It is still the case today; although Denner, owned by the Migros group, does sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.

Here is a summary of some characteristics of Migros and its &quot;responsible&quot; philosophy guided by Gottlieb and Adele Duttweiler&#x27;s &quot;fifteen theses&quot;:
* Does not sell any alcoholic beverages nor any tobacco; (It does so on its online shop, however);
* Does not pay any dividends;
* If the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) reaches 5% of the market value of the company, the supermarkets have to lower their prices;
* Organised as a cooperative (federation of regional cooperatives), with more than two million shareholders;
* Every adult living in Switzerland can become a member (receive a share for free) and vote at the general assembly;
* Uses 1% of its revenue to social and cultural projects.
Migros was also a prominent supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage in Switzerland, it financed a considerable amount of the yes campaigns in the different cantons and also the two national referendums in 1959 and 1971. It counted with an in-house women suffrage committee and for the yes campaign of the successful national referendum in 1971, Migros gave out paper bags printed with advertising for the yes campaign. In its weekly company magazine, which counted with a circulation of about 600&#x27;000 magazines, it published articles supporting women&#x27;s suffrage ahead of the referendum for several weeks.

Adèle and Gottlieb Duttweiler&#x27;s &quot;fifteen theses&quot; (1950), without being legally binding, are an ethical heritage of Migros. They contain values and guidance such as a goal of &quot;serving the community&quot;, &quot;The general principle that we profess is to place people at the center of the economy&quot; and &quot;The general interest will be placed higher than the interests of the Migros cooperatives&quot;.

The company attracted controversy, however, when in 1977 it fired its most outspoken internal critic, Hans A. Pestalozzi, who was then working for the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute, a think tank whose goal was to investigate the shortcomings of capitalism in modern society.

In 2021, Migros began considering alcohol sales in its supermarkets. A June 2022 vote was held and the sale of alcohol was rejected by each of the ten regional cooperatives by an overwhelming majority of their members.
== Migros today ==
To this day, Migros keeps the cooperative society as its form of organisation. A large part of the Swiss population are members of the Migros cooperative – around 2 million of Switzerland&#x27;s total population of 8.4 million, thus making Migros a supermarket chain that is owned by its customers. More than 90% of the assortment of goods is produced by ninety subsidiaries of Migros.

It has obligated itself to spend one percent of its annual turnover for financing cultural projects in a broad sense; the sub-organisation taking care of this is called &quot;Migros Kulturprozent&quot; (&quot;cultural percent&quot;).

The supermarkets are categorized in the three size classes of M, MM and MMM. The firm&#x27;s loyalty card is the M-cumulus card (a play on the word accumulate and a type of cloud formation).

=== M-Budget and Migros Sélection ===
In 1996, influenced by the budget ranges in supermarket chains in Australia, Migros made their budget range called &quot;M-Budget&quot; with seventy products aimed at those with low incomes and large families. Now it has grown to 330 products including mountain bikes, snowboards, mp3 players, milk chocolate, jeans, shoes and lighters. M-Budget products have a standardized packaging color scheme, consisting of a grass green background with the Migros logo in small white text repeated over it.

Many of these products are produced in limited quantities rather than as an integral, permanent part of the Migros line. Whether they become permanent depends on their success. This, combined with the considerable brand recognition that Migros enjoys, conveys a certain amount of desirability to the rarer products. As a result, M-Budget items will sometimes be considered collectibles, as it is not always sure that they will ever be produced again.

To promote the range in the early 2000s Migros developed &quot;M-Budget Party&quot; tickets costing 9.90 CHF including free non-alcoholic drinks (cola, lemonade and orange juice) and snacks (crisps, chocolate and cakes).

In 2005, together with Swisscom, Migros launched M-Budget Mobile, a pay-as-you-go MVNO mobile virtual network operator.

Also in 2005, Migros introduced a premium line called &quot;Migros sélection&quot;, featuring for the most part food products typically associated with higher budgets and prepared in different fashions than is available through general stock. Sélection products also have their distinctive packaging, with pearl white and gold color schemes.

In April 2006, Migros announced the M-Budget credit card, an initiative between the Federation of Migros Cooperatives, GE Money Bank and MasterCard, originally with an annual fee of CHF 4.40, which was very low compared to credit card annual fees of CHF 100 for a MigrosBank MasterCard Argent credit card. The card was ready by the autumn 2006. After Coop, the biggest competitor of Migros, announced a credit card without any annual fee, Migros scrapped its annual fee.

In 2014 the company again followed its main competitor Coop and started implementing self-service checkout.

==Companies==

=== M-Industry ===
A large part of the products sold in the Migros supermarkets are produced by its own companies (M-Industry), mostly in Switzerland. In 2017, M-Industry comprised 32 companies, 25 of which were in Switzerland, and produce more than 20,000 products for the Migros supermarkets.

M-Industry companies include:

M-Industry products are exported to fifty countries, including China (under the name Orange Garten, , in partnership with Tmail).

=== Globus group (formerly owned by Migros) ===
Globus Group became part of Migros in 1997, but was sold to Signa Holding and Central Group in 2020.

* Interio: furniture stores, sold separately to Austrian XXXLutz Group in 2019 before being discontinued for good in 2020.
* Globus: premium department stores
* Globus Herren: menswear stores
* : office supplies (not the British Office Worlds, owned by Staples)
* Globi: a cartoon character who is mascot of the Globus Group, often referred to as Switzerland&#x27;s Mickey Mouse.

== Competitors ==
Migros&#x27;s main competitor, Coop (Switzerland&#x27;s second-largest supermarket chain), also has a cooperative structure like Migros, but with a more centralized organization. Smaller competitors include the Manor department-store chain, and more recently German hard discounter Aldi. A further competitor, Lidl, established its first Swiss supermarkets in March 2009.

In January 2007 Migros acquired 70 per cent Denner&#x27;s shares, effectively merging the largest and third-largest food retail chains in Switzerland. According to both companies, the move took place in order for the Denner chain to better compete with increasing foreign competition.
