<text>In Search of Space (also known as &quot;X in Search of Space&quot; or &quot;Xin Search of Space&quot;) is the second studio album from Hawkwind, released in 1971. It reached No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Background==
Bass player John A Harrison left just after recording the first album, replaced by Thomas Crimble who in turn was replaced by Dave Anderson from Amon Düül II for this album, and who in turn would be gone before its release. Electronics player Dik Mik Davies had also temporarily left so the band&#x27;s live sound engineer Del Dettmar was pulled in as a replacement, whilst Huw Lloyd-Langton had departed after a bad LSD experience at the Isle of Wight Festival.

==Songs==
&quot;You Shouldn&#x27;t Do That&quot; is an extended piece they had been playing live from Crimble&#x27;s time in the band and he asserts he should have received a writer&#x27;s credit for the central bass line on which this is based. It was recorded for a BBC Maida Vale session on 19 May 1971 for the &quot;Sounds of the 70s&quot; show, a bootleg version of the session can be found on &quot;The Text of Festival&quot;. It was the encore for the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; show but omitted from that album, later appearing in 1976 on the compilation album &quot;Roadhawks&quot;. It has been part of the live set at various times throughout their career, versions of which can be found on &quot;The Business Trip&quot; (1994) and &quot;Spaced Out in London&quot; (2004).

&quot;You Know You&#x27;re Only Dreaming&quot; uses the riff and feel from Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;Jackson-Kent Blues&quot; from &quot;Number 5&quot;, an artist Brock has acknowledged being influenced by. This too was recorded for the BBC &quot;Sounds of the Seventies&quot; session and has appeared in the live set at various times throughout their career, including &quot;The 1999 Party&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Business Trip&quot; (1994).
&quot;Master of the Universe&quot; was written by Brock and Turner (who sings the lead vocal), although Anderson contends he should also have received a writer&#x27;s credit for writing the main riff. It is the only track on the album that could be interpreted as lyrically having a space theme, but may also be viewed as being anthropocentric. This was also part of the &quot;Sounds of the Seventies&quot; session and quickly became a live favourite and almost ever present in the set, appearing on numerous live albums. The track was used by the Ford Motor company to advertise the Ford B-Max on television in 2012.

&quot;We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago&quot; is a twelve string guitar number with a band jam in the middle section and its lyrics bemoan the direction of society. A new acoustic version of &quot;We Took The Wrong Step Years Ago&quot; was included on &quot;The Road to Utopia&quot; (2018), produced and arranged by Mike Batt with additional orchestrations.

&quot;Adjust Me&quot; is a band improvisation.

&quot;Children of the Sun&quot; is an acoustic guitar number, although after the vocal passage the repeated heavy riff is augmented by electric guitars and bass.

The bonus track &quot;Seven by Seven&quot;, originally the b-side to &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, uses the riff from late 1960s English psychedelic band Leviathan&#x27;s &quot;Flames&quot;. The lyrics concern the seven rays.

==Recording==
The band originally started to record the album at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios, but after a week with little to show for their effort, and the studio engineers reported to be reluctant to work with the band after friends of the band broke &quot;into George Martin&#x27;s drinks cabinet, pinched all his booze and spiked the engineers with acid&quot;, the record company moved them to Olympic Studios to work with George Chkiantz to finish the recording quickly.

==Sleeve==
The band had started working with a wider range of artists, a number of whom were contributing to the underground press. Graphic artist Barney Bubbles titled the album and designed the cover and with space-age poet Robert Calvert produced the accompanying 24-page &quot;The Hawkwind Log&quot; with photos by Phil Franks.

The front cover is a die-cut interlocking foldout. The back cover has a shot of a naked Stacia on stage under strobe lights and the phrase &quot;TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEA̋D&quot; which some people assert is a demonstration of the heavy metal umlaut. The inside panel features individual portraits of the band, however as Dik Mik had left the band his portrait was not taken, so on rejoining just before the album&#x27;s release a hastily added image was included. Inside the foldout sleeve are various pictures of Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies playing together underneath the Westway in London.

There is no overall concept or theme to the songs on the album; the ideas that would culminate in the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; show are merely contained within the album package, principally &quot;The Hawkwind Log&quot;. It opens with:

Within, the journal entries are from various times and places, including a return to a burnt out Earth in November 1987. Themes explored include astrology and astronomy, ecology, science, occultism and mysticism, religion and philosophy. Some pieces would later be reused, such as the entries &quot;0207 hrs 15 April 1572, Praesepe cluster&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Lift Off&quot; which appeared on &quot;Space Ritual&quot; as &quot;The Awakening&quot; and &quot;Ten Seconds of Forever&quot; respectively, and Black Elk&#x27;s &quot;Offering of the Pipe&quot; &quot;Hetchetu Aloh&quot; chant was later used on &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; from &quot;Space Bandits&quot;. One of the last entries, &quot;1027 hrs. 5 May 1971, Ladbroke Grove&quot;, explains:

==Critical reaction==
&quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewed the album in the context of contemporary German acts, feeling that &quot;their instrumental playing&quot; did not reach the same heights but that &quot;they yield precedence to no-one in their creative use of electronics.&quot; Beat Instrumental assessed the album as &quot;excellent&quot;, saying that the &quot;music alternates between spaced out imagery and hard rock&quot; as well as commenting that this is the start of the space trip leading to the &quot;Space Opera&quot;.

In the US, Lester Bangs in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; favourably appraised the album in the context of other musical works concerned with space, going on to describe the music as &quot;monotone jammings with hypnotic rhythms and solos unravelling off into... well, space. The synthesizers warble, woof and scream and gurgle like barfing computers, the drums pound, and the singers chant Unknown Tongue rebops.&quot; Billboard described the music as &quot;forcefully compelling, electronic and repetitive&quot; and the band &quot;nearly brings to fruition its claim of being a truly &#x27;mind-expanding&#x27; rock group&quot;

In April 2006 it made No. 83 in &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums&quot;, noting that &quot;drummer Terry Ollis and bassist Dave Anderson could hit an awesome groove, allowing the rest of the band to cut loose on their acid-fuelled sonic adventures without fear of losing themselves or their listeners.&quot; In the same issue, Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson placed it at No. 2 in his top 5, adding &quot;it&#x27;s an extraordinary whirlpool of cosmic sound, the definitive space-rock statement. I love the album&#x27;s repetitive, almost pagan feel. It dispensed with the idea of soloists and has a real sense of &#x27;otherness&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Royal warrants of appointment have been issued for centuries to tradespeople who supply goods or services to a royal court or certain royal personages. The royal warrant enables the supplier to advertise the fact that they supply to the issuer of the royal warrant; thus lending prestige to the supplier. Royal families of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and Thailand among others, allow tradesmen to advertise royal patronage.

Suppliers having a royal warrant charge for the goods and services supplied; a royal warrant does not imply that suppliers provide goods or services free of charge. Royal warrants are typically advertised on company hoardings, letter-heads and products by displaying the coat of arms or the heraldic badge of the royal personage issuing the royal warrant. Warrants granted by members of the British royal family usually include the phrase &quot;By Appointment to…&quot; followed by the title and name of the royal customer, and then what goods are provided; no other details of what is supplied may be given.

<doc id="1148296" wikidata="Q317969" url="?curid=1148296" title="Abdus Sattar (president)">
<text>Abdus Sattar (1 March 1906 – 5 October 1985) was a Bangladeshi statesman. A leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), he served as the president of Bangladesh from 1981 to 1982, and earlier as the vice president. A jurist by profession, Abdus Sattar held numerous constitutional and political offices in British India, East Pakistan and Bangladesh. He was a cabinet minister, supreme court judge, and chief election commissioner. He took oath and became president shortly after the assassination of president Ziaur Rahman. 

Abdus Sattar was an elected president through a popular vote.His short lived presidency was marked by growing political turmoil and interference from the military. Abdus Sattar was overthrown in March of 1982 by the then army chief General H.M.Ershad.

== Early life and career ==
Abdus Sattar was born in 1906 in Birbhum in the then Bengal Presidency, British India. He obtained his LLB and Master of Law from the University of Calcutta and joined the Calcutta High Court Bar in 1931 as a junior in the Chambers of A.K. Fazlul Huq. He specialised in Municipal Law. He became a protege of A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. He served in various municipal bodies in Calcutta as an activist for the Krishak Praja Party. In 1950, following the Partition of British India, Abdus Sattar moved to Dacca in the Dominion of Pakistan. He joined the Dhaka High Court Bar. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in 1955. He served as the Home Minister of Pakistan and Education Minister of Pakistan in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar in 1957. He was appointed as a Justice in the Dhaka High Court, which he served between 1957 and 1968. He also presided over cases in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

In 1969, Abdus Sattar was appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan. He organised the first general election of Pakistan in 1970, in which the Awami League gained a historic parliamentary majority to form government. The League was denied the handover of power by the then military junta led by General Yahya Khan. As the Bangladesh Liberation War erupted with a genocide against Bengali civilians, Abdus Sattar was stranded in Islamabad, West Pakistan, removed from official positions and interned by the Pakistani government. In 1973, Abdus Sattar returned to independent Bangladesh as part of the repatriation of stranded Bengali officials. He enjoyed rising prominence in Dhaka, but lived a quiet life with his wife and had no children.

Abdus Sattar served as chairman of the board of directors in the Bangladesh Life Insurance Corporation (1973–1974), chairman of the Journalist Wage Board (1974–1975) and chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs. In 1975, he was appointed as an adviser to President Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem and vested in charge of the Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs. In 1977, the new president and Chief Martial Law Administrator, Lt General Ziaur Rahman, appointed Abdus Sattar as vice president. With the reinstatement of multiparty politics, Abdus Sattar joined the newly formed Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. Speaking of Zia, Abdus Sattar said &quot;He was like my son. I loved him too much. I loved him because he was trying to build this small country in a better way.&quot;

== Presidency ==

When Zia was assassinated in May 1981, a frail Vice-president Abdus Sattar was in hospital and automatically became the acting president of Bangladesh. Speaking to foreign reporters in Bangabhaban on 4 June, he announced that elections within 180 days of the death of the former president were on schedule as per the constitution, to &quot;foil any conspiracy to disturb the democratic process in the country.&quot; A state of emergency was imposed. The election date of 21 September was pushed back to 15 November, as opposition parties demanded more time to campaign. Violence occurred when 12 army officers were executed after being convicted of complicity in Zia&#x27;s killing.

As the nominee of BNP, Abdus Sattar won the presidential election in 1981, beating with a big margin his principal challenger Kamal Hossain from the Bangladesh Awami League. Hossain and other opposition groups alleged the polls were rigged. The emergency was lifted after the election. Abdus Sattar let Zia&#x27;s controversial prime minister Shah Azizur Rahman continue in the top job. He appointed economist Mirza Nurul Huda as the vice president. Sattar appointed a 42-member Council of Ministers. He personally held the Defence and Planning portfolios. Violence against Bengalis in neighbouring Assam, India flared during Abdus Sattar&#x27;s presidency.

Abdus Sattar formed a National Security Council to explore how the Bangladesh Armed Forces could contribute to the nation&#x27;s development. He was elected unopposed as President of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in January 1982. Abdus Sattar then formed a new cabinet. Vice-president Nurul Huda resigned on 21 March 1982, claiming that he was the victim of a conspiracy within the BNP. Abdus Sattar appointed Mohammad Mohammadullah as Nurul Huda&#x27;s replacement.

=== 1982 military coup ===
A bloodless coup-d&#x27;etat led by the Bangladesh Army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad toppled Abdus Sattar&#x27;s government in 1982. On the morning of 24 March, the heads of the Bangladesh Navy, the Bangladesh Air Force, the Bangladesh Rifles and the military secretary to the president entered Bangabhaban and forced Abdus Sattar to sign a statement relinquishing power. Martial law was declared. Abdus Sattar was replaced by the retired justice A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury.

== Pakistan Football Federation ==
Sattar served as president of the Pakistan Football Federation between 1960 and 1961.

== Death ==
Abdus Sattar died at the Suhrawardy Hospital in Dhaka on 5 October 1985, at the age of 79.

<text>Funningsfjørður () is a village located at the end of a fjord of the same name (&#x27;fjørður&#x27; is the Faroese word for &#x27;fjord&#x27;). It was founded in 1812 and has since 2005 been part of the municipality of Runavík.

== Whaling station ==

In 1901, the Norwegian Conrad Evensen bought the old whaling boat &quot;Emma&quot; from a company in the Finnmark in northern Norway, and founded the whaling station in Funningsfjørður, also with the name Emma. The first year the station produced 1160 barrels of whale oil.

The company only had one boat from 1901 to 1909, though in 1905 Emma was whaling from a station in Iceland. In 1909 the company bought a new whaling boat called &quot;Funding&quot;, named after the village Funningur which had lent its name to the fjord which in turn lent its name to the village.

1909 was the best year for whaling in Faroese whaling history, with 13,850 barrels of whale oil produced in total.

In 1912 the station expanded with a bone meal factory, and this increased earnings somewhat, especially because Emma was the only company who whaled &quot;norðanfjørðs&quot; – north of the Skopunarfjord – in 1913 and 1915, meaning north of Suðuroy and Sandoy.

1915 was the best year for Emma, with 3000 barrels of whale oil, and 3000 200lb bags of bone meal. The onset of World War I, however meant that there was never activity at the station again.

In 1956, one of the boiler tanks from the station was taken down and used as filler for the construction of the wharf in the village, which was being built at the time.

On September 15, 2018, the last substantial remnant of the whaling station (the remains of a boiler) was disposed of, as part of an international environmental clean-up event. The Faroese branch of the project, &quot;Rudda Føroyar&quot; (Clean up the Faroe Islands), led the event.

As the band began to lose its momentum, Calogero decided to launch himself as a solo artist and gathered important connections by writing songs and collaborating with already popular artists such as Zazie and Pascal Obispo. The latter helped produce Calogero&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Au milieu des Autres&quot; (2000). His second album, &quot;Calogero&quot; (2002), was a huge success, with the hit singles &quot;En apesanteur&quot; (In Weightlessness), &quot;Aussi libre que moi&quot; (As Free as Me), &quot;Tien an men&quot; and &quot;Prendre racine&quot; (To Take Root). Finally, in 2004, Calogero released &quot;3&quot;, featuring &quot;Face à la mer&quot;, a duet with French rapper Passi, and several other top singles, such as &quot;Yalla&quot; and &quot;Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer&quot; (If Only She Could Miss Me). 
Calogero&#x27;s moving lyrics and frail, tender voice have made him one of France&#x27;s top pop/rock singers.

Calogero released his fourth studio album &quot;Pomme C&quot; on 12 March 2007.

==Collaborations as composer==
Since the late 1990s, Calogero composed songs for many artists, often in collaboration with his brother Gioacchino. For example, he composed songs for Florent Pagny (&quot;Châtelet-les-Halles&quot;), Hélène Ségara (&quot;Au Nom d&#x27;une Femme&quot; and &quot;Regarde&quot;), Ismael Lo (&quot;L&#x27;Amour a tous les droits&quot; and &quot;Faut qu&#x27;on s&#x27;aime&quot;), Pascal Obispo (&quot;Millésime&quot;), Jenifer Bartoli (&quot;C&#x27;est de l&#x27;or&quot;), Julie Zenatti (&quot;La Vérité m&#x27;attire&quot; et &quot;Toutes les douleurs&quot;), Patrick Fiori (&quot;Que tu reviennes&quot;, &quot;Être là&quot;, &quot;Encore&quot;, &quot;Tout le monde&quot;, &quot;Tera umana&quot; et &quot;Il n&#x27;y a pas grand chose à dire&quot;), Fred Blondin (&quot;Je manque de toi&quot; and &quot;Perso et les Aimants&quot;), Mario Barravecchia (&quot;On se ressemble&quot;). He also composed three songs for the musical &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;: &quot;Je n&#x27;avais jamais prié&quot;, &quot;Une Raison d&#x27;espérer&quot; and &quot;Y&#x27;a tant d&#x27;amour&quot;.

Calogero also participates in numerous charities. He is currently member of Les Enfoirés; he also participated in the single &quot;Noël ensemble&quot;, recorded by many artists in 2002; he sang for the &quot;Sidaction&quot; with Jenifer; and recently, he participated in the single &quot;Douce France&quot;, led by Marc Lavoine, to fight discrimination and help young people to find work.

In 2008, Stanislas Renoult recorded a duet with Calogero entitled &quot;La Débâcle des sentiments&quot;.

==Musical style==
Calogero describes his own musical style as &quot;pop rock&quot;. He also said that he listens to the musical work of various artists, such as Barbara, William Sheller, The Cure and The Who, and that &quot;words and melodies are very important to [him]&quot;.

He has a great admiration for the Beatles, especially for Paul McCartney, whose song &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is covered on &quot;Live 1.0&quot;. Calogero said about McCartney, &quot;Paul McCartney? A myth [legend]! For all bassists he is Uncle Paul&quot;. Between his first solo album and his last tour, the musical style evolved significantly to a more percussive rock, and he also said that his fourth album, &quot;Pomme C&quot;, had the closest sound to him.

Calogero is a bass player but he also plays keyboards and guitar. His initial musical training was on the organ. On his first solo album, he plays the guitar, while on the next two he plays bass. He is left handed and sings about this in the song &quot;Conduire en Angleterre&quot;.

==In Circus==

Starting 2012, the French band Circus was established that included Calogero as well as Stanislas, Philippe Uminski, Elsa Fourlon and Karen Brunon, all already established artists. Their debut self-titled album &quot;Circus&quot; was released in 2012.

<doc id="1148311" wikidata="Q1179136" url="?curid=1148311" title="Days sales outstanding">
<text>In accountancy, days sales outstanding (also called DSO and days receivables) is a calculation used by a company to estimate the size of their outstanding accounts receivable. It measures this size not in units of currency, but in average sales days.

Typically, days sales outstanding is calculated monthly. Generally speaking, higher DSO ratio can indicate a customer base with credit problems and/or a company that is deficient in its collections activity. A low ratio may indicate the firm&#x27;s credit policy is too rigorous, which may be hampering sales.

Days sales outstanding is often misinterpreted as &quot;the average number of days to fully collect payment after making a sale&quot;. The formula for this would be Σ. This calculation is sometimes called &quot;True DSO&quot;. Instead, days sales outstanding is better interpreted as the &quot;days worth of (average) sales that you currently have outstanding&quot;. Accordingly, days sales outstanding can be expressed as the following financial ratio:

:DSO ratio = accounts receivable / average sales per day, or
:DSO ratio = accounts receivable / (annual sales / 365 days)

Accounts receivable refers to the outstanding balance of accounts receivable at a point in time here whereas average sales per day is the mean sales computed over some period of time. This can be annual as in the formula above, or it can be any period of time considered useful to the company. Because this is an average general KPI, though, choosing a time period that&#x27;s too low may introduce undesirable artifacts in the data. Typically this is a calendar year or month or a fiscal year or period.

Changes in &quot;the average number of days to fully collect payment after making a sale&quot; &quot;could&quot; impact days sales outstanding in that fluctuations in the length of the average collection effort could affect a company&#x27;s accounts receivable balance, but days sales outstanding is also affected by fluctuations in sales volume.

Days sales outstanding is considered an important tool in measuring liquidity. In some sense it measures the balance between a company&#x27;s sales efforts and collection efforts. If sales decreases in isolation DSO will increase indicating that may run into cash flow problems in future when the sales dip flows through the collection cycle. If sales decreases proportionally to accounts receivable, DSO will not increase. While this may not be welcome news, it does not indicate a change in the balance of sales and receivables, and therefore will not affect DSO. Similarly, taking longer to collect will negatively affect DSO if sales remain the same (since the balance of receivables will increase), but if it&#x27;s accompanied by a proportional increase in sales it does not change the balance of sales to receivables and so does not affect DSO.

Days sales outstanding tends to increase as a company becomes less risk averse. Higher days sales outstanding can also be an indication of inadequate analysis of applicants for open account credit terms. An increase in DSO can result in cash flow problems, and may result in a decision to increase the creditor company&#x27;s bad debt reserve.

Days sales outstanding can vary from month to month, and over the course of a year with a company&#x27;s seasonal business cycle. Of interest when analyzing the performance of a company is the trend in DSO. If DSO is getting longer, accounts receivable is increasing or average sales per day are decreasing. An increase in accounts receivable could indicate that customers are taking longer to pay their bills, which may be a warning that customers are dissatisfied with the company&#x27;s product or service, or that sales are being made to customers that are less credit-worthy, or that salespeople have to offer longer payment terms in order to generate sales. Similarly, a decrease in average sales per day could indicate the need for more sales staff or better utilization.

Some companies may attempt to focus in more on the collection aspect of DSO equation by calculating days delinquent sales outstanding (DDSO). This is simply . Because accounts receivable = current + delinquent accounts receivable, the DDSO formula is often defined as − . While mathematically more complex, it is the same number. This formula can be interpreted as DSO - &quot;Best Possible&quot; DSO, though. In this case it&#x27;s the &quot;Best Possible&quot; because it&#x27;s not assumed that, on average, you can expect your invoices to be paid before the due date. In this interpretation DDSO can be interpreted as the portion of DSO owing to over due receivables. Similar to DSO, though, DDSO can be affected by the speed of collecting overdue invoices but it does not measure speed. It measures size in units of average daily sales.

<doc id="1148315" wikidata="Q585236" url="?curid=1148315" title="Funningur">
<text>Funningur is a village on the Faroe Islands. It is located on the northwest coast of Eysturoy (). It was the only village in the municipality called &quot;Funnings kommuna&quot;, which on 1 January 2009 became part of Runavíkar kommuna.

To the west of the village rises the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands, Slættaratindur (880m), however, the summit itself is not visible from the village.

==History==
Tradition says that the first viking who settled on the Faroe Islands, Grímur Kamban, settled in Funningur. He was a Norwegian Viking escaping the tyranny of the Norse king Haraldur Hárfagri. However, this is an error in the saga, because Harald&#x27;s reign was in the late 9th century, while the first Norse settlers reached the Faroes after 825. (Actually, Irish monks arrived much earlier ca. 625–650).

==Population==
About 70 people live in Funningur on both sides of a cascading stream in a compact cluster of houses around a small bay. The wooden turf-roofed church in Funningur dates from 1847 and stands at the water&#x27;s edge.

Mountains surrounding the village (counter-clockwise from the north):

* Middagsfjall (601m) (due north)
* Gráfelli (856m)
* Slættaratindur (882m) (due west)
* Vaðhorn (780m)
* Blámansfjall (792m) with outcropping Nón (504m)
* Húsafjall (697m) (due south)

<text>In Canada, the National Airport System (, NAS) is a group of major airports defined in the National Airports Policy published in 1994. It was intended to include all airports with an annual traffic of 200,000 passengers or more, as well as airports serving the national, provincial and territorial capitals.

All airports in the NAS, with the exception of the three territorial capitals, are owned by Transport Canada and leased to the local authorities operating them. The three territorial airports are owned and, with the exception of Iqaluit Airport, are operated by their respective territorial governments. Iqaluit is operated by Nunavut Airport Services Limited (NASL), a subsidiary of WASCO (Winnipeg Airport Services Corporation), which in turn is a subsidiary of Winnipeg Airports Authority.

Due to very close proximity to Canada&#x27;s east coast, the airports on the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (an overseas collectivity of France) cooperate with Canada on air travel via several major Canadian airports.

==NAS airports==
The following list contains the 26 NAS airports effective 13 May 2024, the location, operator, and their passenger numbers for 2023 (except where noted):

<text>Gásadalur () is a village located on the west side of Vágar, Faroe Islands, and enjoys a panoramic view over to the island of Mykines.
Gásadalur is located on the edge of Mykinesfjørður, surrounded by the highest mountains on Vágar. Árnafjall towers to a height of 722 metres to the north, and Eysturtindur to the east is 715 metres high. Here too, the view south to Tindhólmur and Gáshólmur is quite magnificent. Eysturtindur translates to English as &quot;the Peak in the East&quot;.

The boat landing site is very poor, because it is located somewhat higher than the seashore. So if the residents wanted to fish, they were obliged to keep their boats near Bøur. In 1940, during the British occupation of the Faroe Islands, a stairway was built from the beach up to the village.

In order to reach any of the other villages by land, residents had to take the strenuous route over mountains more than 400 metres high. This isolation explains why the village population had decreased. In 2002, there were only sixteen people living in Gásadalur, and several of the houses stand empty today. It had a population of 18 in 2012. It had a population of 11 in 2020.

In 2004, the Gásadalstunnilin tunnel was blasted through the rock, and it became possible to drive through by car. The residents hope this will mean that the village population will increase again. While the population increased briefly and reached a peak of 23 in 2010 it has only decreased since then and is at only 11 as of 2020. There are good opportunities for farming, and the same number of fields as in Bøur, but here only a few are royal estate, while most of them are freehold land.

==Etymology==
There is a story that the village was named after a woman called Gæsa, who came from Kirkjubøur. She had eaten meat during the Lent fast, and for this unholy deed all her property was confiscated. She fled to the valley on Vágar, which was named after her. Most other village stories are about spirits and elves.

A more likely explanation is that Gásadalur (&quot;Goose Valley&quot;) is named after the wild geese, which from ancient times have traveled to the valley.

<text>...Calling All Stations... (stylised in all capitals) is the fifteenth and final studio album by English rock band Genesis. It was released 1 September 1997 by Virgin Records and is their only album featuring Scottish singer Ray Wilson as frontman following the departure of long-term drummer/singer Phil Collins in 1996, making it their only album since &quot;Trespass&quot; to not involve Collins. The remaining members—founding keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford—decided to continue the band and write new music for an album, during which they auditioned singers and chose Wilson.

&quot;Calling All Stations&quot; was released to mostly negative reviews from music critics who chastised its lack of direction but praised Wilson&#x27;s performance. It sold poorly in comparison to their earlier albums, reaching No. 2 in the UK and performed well in Europe but it peaked at No. 54 in the US. This marked their first studio album not to reach number one in the UK since 1978. &quot;Congo&quot;, the first of three singles from the album, went to No. 29 in the UK. The Calling All Stations Tour saw Genesis tour Europe throughout 1998 but an American leg was booked and cancelled twice due to low ticket sales. The group disbanded at the tour&#x27;s conclusion, but later reunited with Collins for the Turn It On Again and The Last Domino? Tours.

==Background==

At the end of the We Can&#x27;t Dance Tour in November 1992 the band went on hiatus, reuniting only for a one-off charity performance in September 1993. Their drummer and lead vocalist Phil Collins resumed his solo career and released &quot;Both Sides&quot;, keyboardist Tony Banks recorded an album with Jack Hues under the Strictly Inc. project, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford continued his band Mike and the Mechanics. In mid-1994, Collins said that singing Genesis songs at the charity gig after making &quot;Both Sides&quot;, which he deemed a highly personal album, was uncomfortable. &quot;For the first time I felt like an actor playing somebody else&#x27;s part.&quot; After a band meeting with manager Tony Smith in the summer of 1995, Collins left. A press release from management announcing the news was released in March 1996.

Banks and Rutherford decided they had nothing to lose and started to write new songs in January 1996 to see if it was worth carrying on with Genesis. After some ideas had been put down they were pleased with the results and began to audition lead singers. At this stage, the basic structure of the tracks on &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; had been written but the lyrics had not been worked on. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Wilson described the material as a mixture of their earlier progressive rock sound and their later, more commercial period.

The final two candidates were English singer David Longdon, later a member of Big Big Train, and Scottish singer and guitarist Ray Wilson of the grunge-influenced band Stiltskin. Longdon&#x27;s song &quot;Hieroglyphics of Love&quot; attracted producer Nick Davis who forwarded it onto Banks and Rutherford and liked it enough to invite him to the studio to audition. Banks had liked Wilson&#x27;s vocals from listening to Stiltskin&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1994). For his first audition, Wilson sang Genesis songs with Collins&#x27;s vocals removed. At his second, he was asked to contribute vocal ideas to the new music that Banks and Rutherford had written, singing and humming ideas on the spot. Takes from this session were used by Banks to shape the verses to &quot;There Must Be Some Other Way&quot;. In November 1996, Banks and Rutherford chose Wilson as the new lead singer. Longdon said Rutherford phoned him with the news while Banks sent him a Christmas card with &quot;a lengthy message inside.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s arrival into the band was made public on 6 June 1997.

==Recording==
&quot;Calling All Stations&quot; features Israeli session drummer Nir Zidkyahu and American drummer Nick D&#x27;Virgilio of the prog rock band Spock&#x27;s Beard. Chester Thompson, who had previously served as a touring drummer for Genesis, approached Rutherford about participating, but Rutherford declined his offer. The album was recorded using RADAR, a type of non-linear digital audio recording software capable of simultaneously recording 24-tracks onto computer hard drives.

Wilson said he had a &quot;pretty small&quot; amount of input into the album. He recalled having free rein with his vocals on Rutherford&#x27;s songs because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t know what he wants until he hears it&quot;, whereas Banks had worked out firm ideas from the beginning.

==Songs==
&quot;Calling All Stations&quot; is the first track Banks and Rutherford wrote for the album and most of the original takes were retained for the recorded version. It was used as the opener because of its heavier rock sound and dramatic mood. The song&#x27;s arrangement underwent several changes as Banks and Rutherford had Wilson sing various melody lines to see what his voice was capable of, resulting in a stronger track overall. Wilson picked &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; as his favourite song from the album.

The lyrics to &quot;Small Talk&quot; were written by Wilson. The B-side &quot;Anything Now&quot; was considered one of the strongest tracks from the recording sessions but was not included on the album, as Banks believed &quot;we couldn&#x27;t quite get Ray to sing it right.&quot;

==Release==
The album was launched in Europe on 26 August 1997 with a live press conference, interview, and acoustic performance on German television and VH1 from the Television Tower in Berlin. Two days later, the North American launch event with a live interview and acoustic performance took place at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, broadcast as a nationwide radio special.

&quot;Calling All Stations&quot; peaked at No. 2 in the UK, making it the first Genesis studio album not to reach the top spot since &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; (1978). It was also their first album not to produce a Top 20 single in the UK since &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976). It failed to make an impact in the US chart with a peak at No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This made &quot;Calling All Stations&quot; the first Genesis album since &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973) to not crack its top 50. It also became their first album since &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (1976) to not produce a charting single in the US.

A Super Audio CD/DVD set with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes was released in September 2007. A CD/DVD set was released in North America in November 2007.

==Critical reception==

Steve Knopper reviewed the album in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, calling it &quot;a formless blob of synth sounds&quot; and asserting that new singer Ray Wilson has &quot;no confidence or personality, let alone the vision to stave off his bandmates&#x27; meandering ideas.&quot; Both AllMusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Ray Wilson was a fitting vocal replacement for Collins, but thought that the album was generally lacking in good material. AllMusic picked &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot;, and &quot;Not About Us&quot; as the album&#x27;s stronger tracks, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Shipwrecked&quot; and &quot;Not About Us&quot; as &quot;pleasant if generic FM-rock tunes.&quot; Both also commented on the album&#x27;s odd mix of art rock and pop, believing that it failed to gel into 
a coherent style; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; summarised it as &quot;a Mike and the Mechanics artrock album&quot;. In 2014, Stevie Chick of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dismissed the album as &quot;inexplicable&quot;.

In a 2019 interview, Tony Banks thought the album contained &quot;some very good songs,&quot; but &quot;has a kind of uniformity about it that I regret. It contains one or two rather weak tracks, too. We also left off two of the strongest tracks, which was a mistake.&quot; Rutherford said he did not regret making &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;, but due to its sales being lower than that of previous Genesis albums, he had &quot;sensed that the mood had changed in terms of radio play.&quot; As he thought Genesis was already &quot;becoming a catalogue act,&quot; this influenced the band&#x27;s decision to stop recording new material.

==Tour and aftermath==
Genesis supported the album with a 47-date European tour from 29 January to 31 May 1998, featuring shows in large arenas throughout Europe. The core trio were joined by Zidkyahu on drums, percussion, and backing vocals and Irish musician Anthony Drennan on guitar and bass. Former touring members Daryl Stuermer and Chester Thompson were initially approached, but Stuermer was already working with Collins, and Thompson refused to join after his request for full-fledged band membership was denied. Rehearsals took place at Bray Film Studios in Windsor and the Working Men&#x27;s Club in Chiddingfold, close to the band&#x27;s recording studio. The tour concluded with spots at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festival in Germany. A majority of the older songs were transposed in a lower key to accommodate Wilson&#x27;s lower vocal range. Midway through the set included an acoustic medley of songs from their 1970s output. The tour was captured live on several radio broadcasts; two songs from the NEC Arena (&quot;Not About Us&quot; and a ten-minute version of &quot;The Dividing Line&quot;) were officially released in 2023 on &quot;BBC Broadcasts&quot;. Also, the &quot;Not About Us&quot; single included three acoustic performances from an early radio show at RTL Studios in Paris, 1997. 

A 27-date North American tour in large arenas was booked to start in November 1997, but it was cancelled due to insufficient ticket sales. A revised 22-date tour in smaller venues was arranged, but that too was cancelled. At the European tour&#x27;s conclusion, Genesis went on hiatus until Collins returned for their 2007 Turn It On Again Tour.

The village was first mentioned in 1584, but it seems to have existed long before then. It has long subsisted on fishing and selling dried and salted fish (&quot;klippfiskur&quot; in Faroese). At one time as many as 13 fishing boats sailed from Gjógv. Its population has seen a sharp decline in the past 60 years or so. In 1950 the headcount still stood at 210. A factory producing prefabricated concrete elements was founded in the village in 1982. It employs 6 people and is the only one of its kind in the islands. Other branches of industry are represented by the village&#x27;s fish farm and guest house / hostel and campsite.

==Sights==
The village church dates from 1929. It was the first one to be consecrated in the village and the first one to feature services in Faroese. Before that, the villagers walked to Funningur for church and burial services. On the opposite side of the road a sculpture stands as a memorial to fishermen lost at sea, bearing the names and ages of men from the late nineteenth to the mid twentieth century. The sculpture of a mother and two children looking out to sea was created by Fritjof Joensen.

The village school building dates back to 1884. It was built from boulders and was once in use by as many as 50 pupils. Now there are only three. The old village dance hall was renovated and extended in 1986 and now houses a community centre. All houses in the village conform to the prevailing colourful style of building in the Faroes, red, white and green being the predominant colours used. There are still about 50 houses left in the village. Due to the great decrease in population, about half of that number stand empty.

The nearest grocery store is at Eiði, but Gjógv has a post office in a private home, which opens five days a week for 30 minutes each morning and afternoon. There is also a helicopter pad in the village, used mainly for emergency ambulance service or sea-rescue operations.

Gjógv has one of the best natural harbours in the Faroes. However, boats need to be pulled up on a ramp to be safe from the surf. To tourists and boating natives alike, the harbour in the gorge is also a well-known site of outstanding natural scenery. The village gets its name from the gorge, Faroese &quot;gjógv&quot; is derived from the same Norse word (gjó) as the Shetland dialect &quot;geo.&quot; The inhabitants are known as Gjáarfólk, possibly related to the Icelandic word gjá which itself comes from the Old Norse gjó from which the village name is derived.

Danish crown prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited Gjógv on 22 June 2005. Two elderly inhabitants had the idea of placing a bench with views along the gorge towards the sea. The bench was named &#x27;Mary&#x27;s bench&#x27; (proclaimed by a brass plaque attached to it) and the Crown Princess subsequently became the first to be seated on it. They were also serenaded by Faroese opera singer Rúni Brattaberg on this occasion.

==Gjógv incline railway==
The Gjógv incline railway is notable as the only operating railway in the Faroe Islands. Transport in the Faroe Islands has to engage with the undulating (and often mountainous) terrain, and the large number of bodies of water (mostly fjords and sea channels, but also lakes), all of which makes rail transport difficult to achieve.

The incline railway operates a narrow-gauge line from the low-level harbour inside the gorge, up a steep incline to the boathouses of the upper village. The line terminates just in front of the village coffee house (Gjáarkaffi). There are no locomotives, and motive power is provided by a winch operating a rope which is attached to the goods wagons. Although the railway is designed for freight transportation, it is a common sight to see local people riding on the wagons with the freight. The winch house is located at the top of the incline, overlooking the gorge. The rope passes from the winch house to the pivot through an underground channel, the route of which may be observed as a series of metal plates set into the road surface. From the pivot onwards the rope is attached to the wagons, and on the incline section of the line it passes over rollers set centrally between the rails of the permanent way.

The incline railway was installed to transport goods offloaded from boats, at a time when road transport of commodities was difficult and unreliable, and most items arrived in the village by sea. Today delivery lorries come to the village to supply the hotel, the post office, and the coffee shop, and use of the incline railway has consequently declined. It remains serviceable, still transporting goods, and sometimes also small boats.

==Surroundings==
A number of tracks head up into the uplands north and west of the village. The highest peaks between Gjógv and the neighbouring village of Eiði are Slættaratindur (882 m, 2,894 ft) and Gráfelli (857 m, 2,812 ft). The valley of Ambadalur is located just northwest of Gjógv. Just off the coast at Ambadalur the highest free-standing sea-stack in the Faroes is to be found. It reaches up to an astounding 188 metres (617 ft). Locally known as Búgvin, it offers a safe perch for multitudes of seabirds. The peaks of Tyril and Middagsfjall (601 m, 1,972 ft) are found east of Gjógv. Both peaks offer a phenomenal view of Funningsfjørður (&quot;Funningur&#x27;s Fjord&quot;).

==Gjógv visiting painters==

In 1995 the german artist Ingo Kühl painted watercolors in Gjógv, after which the nine-part Faroe Islands picture cycle was created, which was exhibited in the Royal Danish Embassy in Berlin in 2003/2004.

<doc id="1148337" wikidata="Q760826" url="?curid=1148337" title="Slim Jim (snack food)">
<text>Slim Jim is an American meat snack brand sold globally and manufactured by Conagra Brands. Slim Jim snacks are widely available and popular in the United States, generating $575 million in revenue in 2015. About 1 billion Slim Jim snacks are produced annually in at least 21 varieties.

==History==
Al Levis and his partner Joseph Cherry invented the first Slim Jim in 1929 in Philadelphia. In the 1940s they hired a meatpacker to develop the product for production. In 1967 he sold the company for about $20 million to General Mills, which moved the operations to Raleigh, North Carolina, and merged them into the meatpacking operations of their recently acquired Jesse Jones Sausage Co. to create Goodmark Foods. Ron Doggett moved to Raleigh in 1969 as he was named corporate controller of the newly formed entity, and was later the company&#x27;s Vice President of Finance. In 1982, General Mills put the company up for sale, and Doggett and three other GoodMark executives acquired the company; Doggett assumed the offices of president and chief operating officer. Conagra bought Goodmark in 1998. Until 2009, the former Jones Sausage plant in Garner, North Carolina was the only facility in the world which produced Slim Jims.

The product Levis created is different from the one produced since the 1990s, with Lon Adams (1925–2020) developing the current Slim Jim recipe while working for Goodmark.

Production was interrupted after an explosion and fire on June 9, 2009 heavily damaged the plant in Garner, killing three workers and a subcontractor worker. Conagra reopened the plant six weeks after the incident. Since it could only produce at about half of its original capacity, ConAgra arranged for other facilities to produce Slim Jims including a facility in Troy, Ohio. On May 20, 2011, the facility in Garner closed, the same day that the company&#x27;s former spokesman &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage died.

==Advertising campaigns==
The advertising campaign was developed at North Castle Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut, by Tom Leland and Roger Martensen, under the creative direction of Hal Rosen. The &quot;Snap into a Slim Jim!&quot; concept was originally intended for comedian Sam Kinison, but his legal team didn&#x27;t permit it. Hal Rosen then suggested using WWF (now WWE) wrestlers, and The Ultimate Warrior was selected for the kickoff spot. In addition to a TV spot, The Ultimate Warrior also recorded several radio commercials for Slim Jim in 1991.
From 1993 to 2000, advertising for the product heavily featured professional wrestler &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, who served as spokesperson. Each commercial would close with Savage bellowing &quot;Need a little excitement? Snap into a Slim Jim!&quot;. The campaign not only boosted overall sales but also raised Slim Jim’s profile among teenage male consumers, a demographic that remains at the heart of its following to this day. Other notable commercials have included rapper Vanilla Ice and wrestlers Bam Bam Bigelow, Kevin Nash, Edge and recently Bianca Belair, LA Knight and Jey Uso.

A subsequent campaign featured Slim Jim Guy (played by actor Demetri Goritsas), a human personification of a Slim Jim who would wreak havoc on the digestive system of anyone who ate it and used the slogan &quot;Eat me!&quot; These ads personified the irreverent personality of the brand and were also from North Castle Partners. He also appears as unlockable character in the video game &quot;Dave Mirra&#x27;s Freeestyle BMX 2&quot;.

Slim Jim advertisements were also heavily featured on MTV, ESPN, WWF (now WWE), and WCW. Slim Jim was one of the earliest sponsors of the ASA Pro Tour (the aggressive inline skating tour) from 1997 to 2000. The ASA Pro Tour was a qualifier for ESPN&#x27;s X Games.

In 2005, Slim Jim advertising featured the Fairy Snapmother, described in a Conagra press release as &quot;a character resembling a tattooed rocker with wings – and a familiar MTV-type of humor young males enjoy.&quot;

Another campaign depicted hunters hunting a fictitious &quot;Snapalope&quot; within convenience stores using urban camouflage. The Snapalope is a deer-like puppet made from Slim Jims.

In 2008, Slim Jim launched the website &quot;SpicySide.com&quot;, encouraging consumers to get in touch with their &quot;Spicy Side&quot; by creating an avatar and fighting their friends in an online landscape called Spicy Town. Slim Jim also partnered with a well known Machinima artist Myndflame to develop a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; parody.

As of 2012, the company uses social media as a method of advertisement, using internet humour and memes to gain popularity online, creating an unofficial slogan of “Long Boi Gang” (referring to the snack itself). The Slim Jim account frequently comments on popular Instagram meme pages, and has gained a fair amount of popularity through this alone.

Slim Jim sponsored Bobby Labonte and David Green when they won the NASCAR Busch Series championship in 1991 and 1994, respectively.

==Ingredients==
A 2009 &quot;Wired&quot; article listed some of the ingredients as beef, mechanically separated chicken, lactic acid starter culture, dextrose, salt, sodium nitrite, and hydrolyzed soy. They note that although Conagra refers to Slim Jim as a &quot;meat stick&quot;, it resembles a fermented sausage, such as salami or pepperoni, which uses bacteria and sugar to produce lactic acid, lowering the pH of the sausage to around 5.0 and firming up the meat.

Sodium nitrite is added to prevent the meat from turning gray, and hydrolyzed soy contains monosodium glutamate.

==Varieties==
Slim Jim has launched several spin-off products of its main brand. These products are often of higher quality than the original Slim Jim, using premium meats. Such products include both tender steak strips and beef jerky.

The tender steak strips come in three flavors. Its companion beef jerky comes in four flavors: an original flavor, two spicy flavors, and one smokin&#x27; apple flavor.

<doc id="1148352" wikidata="Q3303289" url="?curid=1148352" title="Gladstone, South Australia">
<text>Gladstone (including the former town of Booyoolie) is a small rural town in the Mid North of South Australia in the approach to the lower Flinders Ranges. At the 2006 census, Gladstone had a population of 629.

The town services the surrounding district with two pubs, three churches, a bank, post office and several shops and small businesses providing basic goods and services. The closest hospital is 11 km away in a neighbouring rural town, but doctors take appointments in the town&#x27;s medical clinic. There is a kindergarten (approximately 12 enrollments), state primary school (63), Catholic primary school (60) and a secondary school (approximately 205 students, drawn from the wider district).

Gladstone has sporting/social clubs providing for Aussie Rules football, netball, cricket, tennis, golf, lawn bowls, swimming (at the local outdoor pool) and soccer (newly formed for school-aged children), all seasonal. Sporting competitions occur between clubs from the neighbouring towns within a radius of about 75 km.

Wheat and sheep are the main farming produce of the region, but Gladstone has the largest inland grain storage facility in the Southern Hemisphere, storing wheat, barley, durum wheat, peas, faba beans and fiesta beans.

The Anglican Diocese of Willochra is based in Gladstone, with the Registry (the Diocesan Office) housed in building in the main street. In addition the Bishop of Willochra lives in Bishop&#x27;s House which is on the Main North Road.

Gladstone was the home of Trend Drinks, a local soft drink manufacturer, from its founding in 1876 until it moved to Corowa, New South Wales in 2016.

==History==
The town of Gladstone was privately laid out by Matthew Moorhouse east of the railway line in October 1872 on Section 31, Hundred of Yangya. A government town named Booyoolie was laid out in March 1875 on the western side of the railway line in the Hundred of Booyoolie. In 1940, Booyoolie was renamed Gladstone to match the private town and railway station. The name Gladstone is derived from William Ewart Gladstone, a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

During World War II, the RAAF No. 28 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot was established near Gladstone. It consisted of large tanks concealed under earthen mounds. The Gladstone depot was one of 31 fuel depots established across Australia in places that were remote from airfields and immune to naval attack.

==Heritage listings==

Gladstone has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* 42 Gladstone Street: National Australia Bank Building
* 44 Gladstone Terrace: Savings Bank of South Australia Building
* Ward Street: Gladstone Gaol

==Railways==

Gladstone is located on the main Crystal Brook-Broken Hill railway line, with branches going north and south.

Originally, all the lines were gauge narrow gauge railways, starting with the line from Port Pirie in 1875, extended to Petersburg (now Peterborough) in 1880 and to Cockburn (on the state border near Broken Hill) in 1888. A branch from Gladstone to Laura in 1884 was extended to Wilmington in 1915. The line from the south (extending the line that terminated at Blyth) was completed in 1894. In 1927, the line from Hamley Bridge through Blythe to Gladstone was converted to broad gauge, making Gladstone a break-of-gauge junction.

In 1970, the line from Port Pirie to Broken Hill was converted to standard gauge making Gladstone into a rare three-gauge break-of-gauge junction as the Wilmington railway line to the north remained an isolated narrow gauge line. In the 1980s, the broad and narrow gauge lines were closed, leaving Gladstone as a purely standard gauge station.
Journey Beyond&#x27;s weekly Indian Pacific experiential train service passes Gladstone on its route but it does not stop at the station.

<doc id="1148355" wikidata="Q2705852" url="?curid=1148355" title="White Lilies Island">
<text>White Lilies Island is the second studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Natalie Imbruglia. It was released by RCA Records on 5 November 2001 in most international territories and on 5 March 2002 in the United States. For this album, Imbruglia collaborated with songwriter, Gary Clark, with whom she co-wrote majority of the album materials. Other collaborators include Phil Thornalley, who was a major contributor of her previous album, as well as Ian Stanley, Matt Wilder and Patrick Leonard. Attempting to take more control of her creative direction, Imbruglia admitted that she suffered from writer&#x27;s block, perfectionism and isolation during the recording process. She co-wrote 64 songs potentially intended for the album. The album is named after the location of Imbruglia&#x27;s home in Windsor.

Musically, &quot;White Lilies Island&quot; is a rock album, with element of pop, and acoustic sounds. The album was notable for being the first to include copy protection software on compact disc pressing, but later removed due to surrounding technical faults that resulted to consumer outcry. Upon release, &quot;White Lilies Island&quot; received polarized reviews, while some critics praised the album for its dark and distinctive tone compared to her predecessor. Commercially, the album charted within top five in Australia, top twenty in the United Kingdom, and top forty in the United States. &quot;White Lilies Island&quot; has sold one million copies worldwide.

==Background, songwriting and production==
In May 1998, during a backstage interview at MTV Movie Award where she performed, Imbruglia told journalists she was writing new songs during her time off. In June 1998, Imbruglia also informed &quot;Washington Post&quot; that she began to sketch songs for her sophomore album, and would collaborate again with Phil Thornalley, producer of &quot;Torn&quot; and former Eurythmics Dave Stewart. However, she also indicated that she would let things happen naturally and wouldn&#x27;t rush the process.

In October 1999, after receiving an Outstanding Achievement Award on stage at 13th ARIA Music Awards, Imbruglia was asked by the presenter Molly Meldrum about the progress of her second album production, to whom she replied: &quot;“...it&#x27;s coming along fine”&quot;.

In early 2000, when Imbruglia was being interviewed by Chris Evans on TFI Friday, she said that she had been hunting for her second album, and that she was writing intensively. However, she also stated that she needed to have a balanced life.

Imbruglia chose to name her album &quot;White Lilies Island&quot; as she wanted to associate the album with the location where most of the songwriting took place. For Imbruglia, the island could be meant as bliss and paradise but also a total isolation which contributed to her complex feelings during the process of making the album. Imbruglia emphasized that it was essential for her to be a major contributor for every song on the album, highlighting the pressure she had felt after the unexpected worldwide success of her debut single, &quot;Torn&quot; which had been a cover. She also stated that she&#x27;d have liked to write songs in her bedroom during afternoon and that being single at the time helped her finish the album the way she wanted. For all the songs on the album, Imbruglia highlighted &quot;Butterflies&quot; as the first song she wrote which helped her determine the overall sound and mood for the album, as well as &quot;That Day&quot; which she favored due to its distinctive style, she also praised RCA Records for being brave to release &quot;That Day&quot; as the first single internationally even though it&#x27;s not a pop radio-friendly song and a commercial risk.

==Singles==
* That Day was released on 29 October 2001 as the lead single of the album internationally. It peaked at number 10 on ARIA Single Chart and number 11 on the UK Singles Chart.
* Wrong Impression was released on 29 January 2002 as the second single of the album internationally, and the lead single in North America. It peaked at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Top 40, and number 10 in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
* Beauty on the Fire was released on 22 July 2002 as the third and last single of the album. It peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Copy protection==
&quot;White Lilies Island&quot; is notable for being the first album to implement copy protection on compact disc. To prevent consumers from illicitly copying the album, a 24.5 megabyte data file is included on the disc that interferes with the methods by which personal computers read the twelve audio tracks. Instead of reading outwards from the centre, PC CD-ROM drives usually start reading inwards from the outermost end of the data track. The copy protection scheme takes advantage of this difference by offering them a separate data session and appearing as a CD-ROM instead of an Audio CD. The data section contains a second, highly compressed representation of the same music content, which allows playback on PCs, but with a greatly reduced audio quality compared to the actual CDDA data (at a data rate of 80 kbit/s rather than the standard 1.4 Mbit/s). Additionally, the copy protection software prevents some Macintosh computers and all Philips CD recorders from reading the disc and causes other Macs to avoid playing track one; this latter fault is also present when trying to play the disc on a PlayStation 2 video game console. No message exists on the disc&#x27;s packaging that it is copy protected. The various technical faults caused by the CD&#x27;s copy protection software resulted in significant public backlash. Among others, a spokesman from Philips stated that &quot;any changes that put a disc outside the CD standard result in a disc that should no longer be described or marketed as a CD&quot; in reference to &quot;White Lilies Island&quot;, while Julian Midgeley, a spokesman for the Campaign for Digital Rights, stated that &quot;all they are doing is annoying a lot of people who cannot do with it what they want to do, which is just listen to it.&quot; The outcry ultimately forced Bertelsmann Music Group to reissue the album on CD with the software removed and offer free replacement discs to affected buyers. A hotline was set up where buyers could order replacement discs starting 19 November 2001.

==Critical reception==

The album met with mixed reviews. At Metacritic it received a score of 54 out of 100. AllMusic gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars saying: &quot;Imbruglia has made a brilliant pop record -- contemporary, yet timeless. White Lilies Island would have suffered without Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s perfectionism, and it would have lost sight of the elegance it so perfectly exudes.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; gave a rating of 2 out of five stars, commenting: &quot;White Lilies Island skips from one song to the next without leaving any great impression or displaying a single sentiment Jessica Simpson would find distressing. If, however, she was trying to remake &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, it&#x27;s all gone horribly wrong.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a positive review and said: &quot;The disc continues in the same vein of agreeable pop-radio fodder as &#x27;Torn&#x27;, with an all-new group of distraught romantics and connection seekers singing creamy choruses.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a negative review and said it&#x27;s &quot;a great brother of her debut.&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave the album a rating of 8 out of ten stars and said: &quot;She&#x27;s certainly on the way to achieving her goal. She chips in a hefty wedge of the lyric sheet to the album in the shape of confessional lovesick outpourings that, despite lapses, bind the gutsy album cohesively giving it sophistication, direction and genuine feeling.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
In Australia the album debuted at number 3 and was certified Gold, despite enjoying only a small resurgence in sales with subsequent singles. The album debuted at number 15 on the UK Albums Chart with 21,000 in sales before dropping out of the top 75 in its fourth week. It re-entered the top 30 with the release of the second single &quot;Wrong Impression&quot; and sold eventually nearly 200,000 copies in the UK overall. In the US the album debuted at number 35 with 35,000 in sales and dropped out of the Top 200 after seven weeks, eventually selling 215,000 overall. Worldwide, &quot;White Lilies Island&quot; has sold around a million copies.

<text>In physics, [[Bernard Lamy|Lami]]&#x27;s theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear vectors, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding vectors. According to the theorem,

:formula_1

where formula_2 are the magnitudes of the three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear vectors, formula_3, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and formula_4 are the angles directly opposite to the vectors, thus satisfying formula_5.

Lami&#x27;s theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems. The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy.

== Proof ==

As the vectors must balance formula_6, hence by making all the vectors touch its tip and tail the result is a triangle with sides formula_7 and angles formula_8 (formula_4 are the exterior angles).

By the law of sines then

formula_10

Then by applying that for any angle formula_11, formula_12 (supplementary angles have the same sine), and the result is

formula_13

<doc id="1148363" wikidata="Q214977" url="?curid=1148363" title="Robert Blum">
<text>Robert Blum (10 November 1807 – 9 November 1848) was a German democratic politician, publicist, poet, publisher, revolutionary and member of the National Assembly of 1848. In his fight for a strong, unified Germany he opposed ethnocentrism and it was his strong belief that no one people should rule over another. As such he was an opponent of the Prussian occupation of Poland and was in contact with the revolutionaries there. Blum was a critic of antisemitism, supported the German Catholic sect, and agitated for the equality of the sexes. Although claiming immunity as a member of the National Assembly, he was arrested during a stay at the hotel &quot;Stadt London&quot; in Vienna and executed for his role in the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

==Biography==

Blum grew up in poverty in Cologne, the son of a failed theologian who made a poor living as a cooper. He was ten years old before he could go to school. After his schooling, he worked as a craftsman in different trades. He failed as a goldsmith&#x27;s apprentice, but completed an apprenticeship as a gardener. After his journeyman&#x27;s time, he returned to Cologne to work in a lamp factory. His employer put him to work at the counter since he was good at calculations. In 1829, he followed his employer to Berlin where he also continued his education. His work was interrupted by obligatory military service, and on his release, his poor circumstances obliged him to return to Cologne. There, in 1830, he worked serving in a theater company and started writing politically motivated poetry and plays. When the theater closed in the summer, he worked for a sheriff as a scribe.

The political upheavals of 1830 attracted his interest, and ideals of freedom found their way into his poetry. In 1832, he followed the theater troupe to Leipzig. There he came in touch with humanist and liberal circles, contributed to the liberal newspaper &quot;Zeitung für die elegante Welt&quot; and joined Leipzig&#x27;s freemason lodge. By 1840, he had worked his way up to being a cashier in the city theater. That year he also founded the Schillerverein in Leipzig which celebrated the poet&#x27;s anniversary as a festival in honor of political liberty.

Beginning in 1839, Blum became a leading figure in the Kingdom of Saxony&#x27;s national-liberal circles; as a gifted orator and organizer, he helped establish Saxony&#x27;s opposition movement as a serious political force. His initial attempt at a newsletter was suppressed by the censor, but another one continued for four years with occasional lapses due to the censor. He became a German Catholic when Johannes Ronge came to Leipzig, and wrote on that movement&#x27;s behalf. In 1845, Blum organized the first German Catholic synod in Leipzig that marked the beginning of Germany&#x27;s humanist free religious movement. In 1844, he gave up his theater job to found a book store.
In 1845, the presence of John of Saxony stirred the masses and the military fired on them. At a turbulent meeting of armed citizens and students of Leipzig, Blum dissuaded them from storming the barracks, and urged conformity to the law. This resulted in his being elected a representative in Leipzig&#x27;s government.

Blum embraced the upheavals of 1848. He was one of the presidents of the preliminary parliament at Frankfurt which he dominated with his energy, imposing figure and pithy speeches. As a member of the succeeding parliament and leader of the left, he worked to contain the most radical elements. Blum&#x27;s trustworthiness was questioned when the extreme leftist Arnold Ruge claimed Blum had moved toward his side. As the leader of the radical liberal faction, he strongly opposed the Malmö Treaty between Denmark and Prussia that abolished Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s democratically elected government. He was also one of the most vocal supporters of popular sovereignty.
In October, when revolutionary fighting broke out in Vienna, Blum travelled there as part of a parliamentarian envoy and joined the revolutionary forces. On the surrender of the capital to Windischgrätz, Blum was arrested with several of his companions on 4 November. Brought before a military tribunal, he pleaded in vain his privileges as a deputy from the German Diet and was condemned to be hanged, a sentence which was changed to death by the bullet. He was executed on 9 November. His death became a symbol for the futility of Germany&#x27;s 1848 rebellion; the day of his death marks the first of a series of events that led to November 9 being referred to as Germany&#x27;s &quot;Schicksalstag&quot; (fateful day).

His son Hans Blum was a noted writer and journalist.

<doc id="1148372" wikidata="Q7069458" url="?curid=1148372" title="John McCririck">
<text>John Michael McCririck (17 April 1940 – 5 July 2019) was an English horse racing pundit, television personality and journalist.

McCririck began his career at &quot;The Sporting Life&quot;, where he twice won at the British Press Awards for his campaigning journalism, but his role was terminated in 1984. In 1981, he joined ITV Sport&#x27;s horse racing coverage which moved, during 1984 and 1985, to Channel 4 as &quot;Channel 4 Racing&quot;. In October 2012, the channel announced that he would be dropped from its team, which McCririck blamed on ageism; he took the matter to an employment tribunal, but lost the case.

From the 1980s, McCririck appeared as a contestant on numerous television shows, including &quot;Bullseye&quot;, &quot;You Bet!&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Wife Swap and Celebrity Poker Club&quot;. He also appeared on the current affairs discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Surbiton, Surrey, to property-developer parents, McCririck was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Victoria College, Jersey, and Harrow School, where his fellow pupils included Julian Wilson, later a fellow racing journalist. He left with three O-Levels, having also run the book on cross country races.

==Career==
After failing to get into the diplomatic service, McCririck was briefly a waiter at The Dorchester hotel. During the era when off-course betting was illegal in the UK, he worked for an illegal bookmaker, before becoming a bookmaker himself, at which he admitted to having failed. He then became a tic-tac man.

He began his career in journalism at &quot;The Sporting Life&quot;, where he twice won at the British Press Awards for his campaigning journalism; he was sacked in 1984. He joined the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, but was later sacked by the newspaper after allegations emerged that he was in debt to his bookmaker; he later successfully sued the paper at an employment tribunal.

Having previously become a results sub-editor on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot;, from 1981 he joined ITV Sport&#x27;s horse racing coverage; he had previously appeared in a debate about fox hunting on the ITV children&#x27;s programme &quot;Saturday Banana&quot; in 1978. During 1984 and 1985, horse racing moved from ITV to Channel 4 as &quot;Channel 4 Racing&quot;, where his role was expanded and he reported from the betting ring. His signature flamboyant attire of a large deerstalker hat, sideburns, and brightly coloured matching suits and trousers, coupled with huge cigars, became a recognisable personal style.
In 1988, on the evening after the Grand National, he made an extended appearance on the &quot;After Dark&quot; topical discussion programme on Channel 4, alongside Barney Curley and the Duchess of Argyll, in an episode entitled &quot;Horse Racing, Sport Of Kings?&quot;

In October 2012 Channel 4 announced that McCririck would not be included in the team presenting racing from January 2013, which McCririck blamed on ageism, taking Channel 4 to an employment tribunal. On 13 November the tribunal ruled against McCririck saying, &quot;All the evidence is that Mr McCririck&#x27;s pantomime persona, as demonstrated on the celebrity television appearances, and his persona when appearing on &quot;Channel 4 Racing,&quot; together with his self-described bigoted and male chauvinist views were clearly unpalatable to a wider audience.&quot; The panel was told by witnesses from the television station and IMG (the production company) that he was dropped because he was &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;.

In December 2018 McCririck joined the editorial team at &quot;The Racing Paper&quot; as a weekly columnist.

==Other media appearances==
McCririck appeared on the 1991 &quot;Bullseye&quot; Christmas Special, winning the top prize for his chosen charity, the Sue Ryder Foundation. He also appeared in the &quot;Celebrity Poker Club&quot; television series, reaching the Grand Finale of series one, won by Sir Clive Sinclair. McCririck also appeared during ITV&#x27;s snooker coverage in a betting capacity.

In March 1994, he appeared on the BBC One TV show &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, receiving a Gotcha trophy.

In 1997, McCririck was tricked by two separate episodes of spoof TV show &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, once in an item about artificial insemination and another in an item, appearing as himself, about Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe starring in a musical while on day-release from prison.

In January 2005, he was a contestant in the third series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. He competed on &quot;Weakest Link.&quot; In April 2005, McCririck appeared on an episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; (season 3, episode 8) in which Head Chef Marco Pierre White refused to serve him after McCririck told him that his consommé was &#x27;greasy&#x27;, in spite of being informed that it contained &quot;foie gras&quot; and truffle oil. White commented after the sequence, &quot;I know John. He&#x27;s awkward, he&#x27;s got no taste. All you have to do is look at how he dresses.&quot;

In 2006, he appeared in the episode &quot;Drama&quot; on the show &quot;Still Game&quot;, playing himself on Channel 4 Racing telling Winston Ingram which horse to back. McCririck was a housemate in &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot; in August 2010.

In 2011, he was featured in the fourth episode of the British version of &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; recounting his experiences of a haunted passageway at Harrow School.

On 26 June 2015, on the sixteenth series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, it was announced that McCririck would be returning to Big Brother, taking part in Big Brother&#x27;s Hotel from Hell the following week, where he would be staying in the house and other ex-housemates would join him on Monday 29 June.

==Personal life==
McCririck married Jennifer Barnes in 1971 and referred to her as &quot;The Booby&quot;. He was accused of frequent misogyny. In 2006, the couple took part in &quot;Wife Swap&quot; alongside Edwina Currie and her husband. McCririck was also a well-known supporter of Newcastle United.

In early 2018, McCririck contracted influenza which resulted in a chest infection. The illness caused him to suffer dramatic weight loss.

==Death==
McCririck died at The Princess Grace Hospital, London, on 5 July 2019, after a short illness with lung cancer; he was 79.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the day McCririck died, racing correspondent Chris Cook said: “He was outrageous, in both speech and appearance, because what he wanted most of all was a reaction and so he enlivened many a broadcast or social occasion that might otherwise have fallen rather flat... While McCririck thrived on the attention his persona brought him, the buffoon act sold him short. He was a skilled journalist whose investigations uncovered a couple of betting-related scandals in the 70s. The producers of Channel 4 Racing almost invariably turned to McCririck when there was a serious interview to be done.” 

On 12 July 2019 McCririck was featured in the BBC Radio 4 obituary programme &quot;Last Word.&quot;

<text>Glyvrar () is a village located on Eysturoy, in the Faroe Islands.

It is one of several villages on the east side of the Skálafjørður fjord that have grown into a 10-kilometre-long conurbation. 

In Glyvrar there is a museum called ’Bygdasavnid Forni’. The church in Glyvrar was originally built in 1927, but it was heavily restored in 1981.

From 1903 to 1928 there was a school for navigators in Glyvrar. Graduates from here would become masters of fishing-ships. 

The Bible translator Victor Danielsen worked as a teacher in Glyvrar in 1914.

The salmon-farming company Bakkafrost is based in Glyvrar. Bakkafrost is the largest fish farming company in the Faroe Islands and one of the biggest private employers in the islands, if not the biggest. Bakkafrost is the eighth largest fish-farming company in the world.

<text>The Nile lechwe or [[Maria Emma Gray|Mrs Gray&#x27;s]] lechwe (Kobus megaceros) is an endangered species of antelope found in swamps and grasslands in South Sudan and Ethiopia.

==Description==

Males are an average of long and tall at the shoulders, and weigh between , while females are an average of long, tall at the shoulders, and weigh . Nile lechwes live an average of 10 to 11.5 years, and most uncommonly 19 years.

Their coats are shaggy with the hair on the cheeks particularly long in both sexes, and males may have even longer hair on their necks. Nile lechwe exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are golden-brown with white underbellies and no horns. Juveniles also have a golden-brown coat, but the color changes to dark brown in young males when they reach two to three years of age. Adult males are blackish-brown to russet with white &#x27;hoods&#x27; over their shoulders and small white patches over their eyes. The horns of the adult males are long, strongly ridged at their bases and are curved at the tips.

==Ecology==

Nile lechwe can visually signal and vocalize to communicate with each other. They rear high in the air in front of their opponents and turn their heads to the side while displaying. Females are quite loud, making a toad-like croaking when moving. When fighting, males duck their heads and use their horns to push against each other. If one male is significantly smaller than the other, he may move next to the larger male in a parallel position and push from there, which prevents the larger male from pushing with all his force. Known predators are humans, lions, crocodiles, cheetahs, wild dogs, hyenas and leopards. They flee to water if disturbed, but females defend their offspring from smaller predators by direct attack, mainly kicking, if a male is cornered he will use his metre long horns to defend himself. Yearling Nile lechwes are often infected by warble flies, which can make them unhealthy and result in high mortality rates.

Nile lechwe are crepuscular, active in the early morning and late afternoon. They gather in herds of up to 50 females and one male or in smaller all-male herds. They divide themselves into three social groups: females and their new offspring, bachelor males, and mature males with territories. A males with territory sometimes allows a bachelor male into his territory to guard the region and not to copulate.

==Diet==

Nile lechwe feed on succulent grasses and water plants. Wild rice is thought to be a preferred food at the start of the flood season, while a larger proportion of swamp grasses are consumed when the waters recede. They have the special capability to wade in shallow waters and swim in deeper waters, and may feed on young leaves from trees and bushes, rearing up to reach this green vegetation. Nile lechwe are also found in marshy areas, where they eat aquatic plants.

==Reproduction==

Both sexes reach sexual maturity when they are two years old. Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks between February and May. During mating season, young males bend their horns to the ground as if to poke the earth. Males fight in the water, their heads submerging in horn-to-horn combat, for dominance. These contests are usually short and violent. As in many other animals, the dominant male copulates with the female. A unique form of marking is seen with the start of mating. The male bends his head to the ground and urinates on his throat and cheek hair. He then rubs his dripping beard on the female&#x27;s forehead and rump.

The gestation period is seven to 9 months long on average, after which a single calf is born. Infants weigh about . Females experience estrus again about a month after producing young. After its birth, the calf is kept hidden in thick vegetation for two to three weeks, where the mother nurses it. It is weaned at five to six months, and a few months later is ready to be independent and join the herd.

==Habitat and distribution==
The Nile lechwe typically occur in shallow waters bordering deeper swamps, where the water is deep. Nile lechwe are endemic to South Sudan and Ethiopia. In Sudan, the majority of the population occurs in the Sudd swamps, and in the Machars near the Ethiopian border in smaller numbers. In Ethiopia occurs in the southwest, in Gambela National Park, but in very less numbers possibly due to human settlement and habitat degradation. The habitat of the Nile lechwe has been severely affected by civil wars, human displacement and resettlement, firearm attacks and increased hunting. Even its seasonal movements were restricted due to large populations of cattle in and around its range. The Nile lechwe population in the Sudds, however, remained somewhat stable throughout this period.

== Conservation ==
The Nile lechwe has been classified under the Endangered category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1983, aerial surveys gave a total population estimate of 30,000-40,000 individuals, of which 95 percent were concentrated in the Sudds and the rest occurred between Sudan and Ethiopia. In the 1980s, the population in the Machars was estimated at 900. A population of around 150 was also reported from the swamps in Gilo River in 1967. There is also an increasing population held in captivity.
In 2007, the population of the Sudd region was estimated to be of 4,291 animals, indicating that the species has declined rapidly since the previous survey in 1983.

In South Sudan, Nile lechwe populations occur in three protected areas : Zeraf Game Reserve, that extends over along the Bahr el Zeraf; Fanyikang Game Reserve, north of Bahr el Ghazal, covering over ; and Shambe National Park, that stretches over along Bahr al Jabal. The Nile lechwe keep moving in and out of these areas. In Ethiopia they occur in the Gabella National Park. A study outlined priorities for both in situ and ex situ conservation of this species.

<text>New Old Songs is the only remix album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit. Released on December 4, 2001, the album contains hip hop remixes of songs from the band&#x27;s first three studio albums &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; (1997)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000)&quot;.&quot; It is also the sixteenth best-selling remix album of all time.

== Music and lyrics ==

The sound of &quot;New Old Songs&quot; is predominantly based in hip hop music, in particular rap infused with rock music styles and culture. The album compiles remixes of songs from &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot;, &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. This album&#x27;s remix of &quot;Faith&quot;, a cover of the George Michael song, incorporates elements of David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Fame&quot; and a newly recorded rap verse by Everlast.

== Critical reception ==

Despite having no singles released, it achieved Gold certification by the RIAA in February 2002 in the US. The album peaked at #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano panned the album, writing &quot;Most of these songs could have even survived the remix if the choruses, which are an important part of the Bizkit formula, retained their massive riffing and awesome production.&quot; Torreano appraised three of the album&#x27;s tracks: Fred Durst and Josh Abraham&#x27;s remix of &quot;Faith&quot;, DJ Premier&#x27;s remix of &quot;My Way&quot; and Butch Vig&#x27;s &quot;Nookie&quot; remix. Describing Vig&#x27;s &quot;Nookie&quot; remix, Torreano said that it might be the album&#x27;s best track, writing that it &quot;sounds more like Fatboy Slim with its thick beat and dirty keyboard&quot;. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; awarded the album two out of five stars. In &quot;The Essential Rock Discography&quot;, Martin Charles Strong gave the compilation a 5 out of 10 rating.

<text>Marimo (also known as Cladophora ball, moss ball, moss ball pet, or lake ball) is a rare growth form of Aegagropila linnaei (a species of filamentous green algae) in which the algae grow into large green balls with a velvety appearance.

The species can be found in a number of lakes and rivers in Japan and Northern Europe. Colonies of marimo balls are known to form in Japan and Iceland, but their population has been declining.

==Classification and name==
Marimo were first described in the 1820s by Anton E. Sauter, found in Lake Zell, Austria. The genus &quot;Aegagropila&quot; was established by Friedrich T. Kützing (1843) with &quot;A. linnaei&quot; as the type species based on its formation of spherical aggregations, but all the &quot;Aegagropila&quot; species were transferred to subgenus &quot;Aegagropila&quot; of the genus &quot;Cladophora&quot; later by the same author (Kützing 1849). Subsequently, &quot;A. linnaei&quot; was placed in the genus &quot;Cladophora&quot; in the Cladophorales and was renamed &quot;Cladophora aegagropila&quot; (L.) Rabenhorst and &quot;Cl. sauteri&quot; (Nees ex Kütz.) Kütz. Extensive DNA research in 2002 returned the name to &quot;Aegagropila linnaei&quot;. The presence of chitin in the cell walls makes it distinct from the genus &quot;Cladophora&quot;.

The algae was named &quot;marimo&quot; by the Japanese botanist Takiya Kawakami in 1898. is a type of bouncy play ball; is a generic Japanese term for plants that grow in water. The native names in Ainu are (&#x27;lake goblin&#x27;) and (&#x27;lake roller&#x27;). They are sometimes sold in aquariums under the name &quot;Japanese moss balls&quot; although they are unrelated to moss. In Iceland the lake balls are called by the local fishermen at Lake Mývatn ( meaning &#x27;ball&#x27;, meaning &#x27;muck&#x27;) where the &quot;muck&quot; is any weeds that get entangled in their fishing nets. The generic name &quot;Aegagropila&quot; is Greek for &#x27;goat hair&#x27;.

==Growth forms==
The algae has three growth forms:

* It can grow on rocks, usually found on the shaded side of the rocks.
* It can exist as free-floating filaments. Small tufts of unattached filaments frequently form a carpet on the muddy lake bottom.
* It can form a lake ball where the algae grow into sizable balls of densely packed algal filaments that radiate from the center. The balls do not have a kernel of any sort.

==Ecology==
The existence of marimo colonies depends on the adaptation of the species to low light conditions, combined with the dynamic interaction of wind-induced currents, light regime, lake morphology, bottom substrate, and sedimentation.

=== Size ===

The growth rate of marimo is about per year. In Lake Akan in Japan they grow particularly large, up to . Lake Mývatn, Iceland, had dense colonies of marimo that grow to about in diameter and formed well defined patches on the lake floor at depths ranging from .

=== Shape ===
The round shape of the marimo is maintained by gentle wave action that occasionally turns it. The best environment for that are shallow lakes with sandy bottoms.

The balls are green all the way round which guarantees that they can photosynthesize no matter which side is turned upwards. Inside, the ball is also green and packed with dormant chloroplasts which become active in a matter of hours if the ball breaks apart. The wave action also cleans the balls of dead organic material.

As some colonies have two or even three layers of marimo balls, wave action is needed to tumble them around so each ball reaches the light. The spherical shape has a low surface-area-to-volume ratio compared to a leaf, which limits photosynthesis and therefore limits the maximum size of the marimo balls.

=== Habitat ===
Marimo&#x27;s preferred habitat is in lakes with a low or moderate biological activity, and with moderate or high levels of calcium.

=== Distribution ===
The species is mainly found in the areas of Europe previously covered in glaciers (Northern-Europe), and in several places in Japan. It has been found in North America, but it is rare, as well as in Australia.

===Population decline===
The species is sensitive to the amount of nutrients in the water. An excess of nutrients (due to agriculture and fish farming), along with mud deposition from human activity are thought to be the main causes for its disappearance from many lakes.

The species still exists in Lake Zell in Austria (where it was first discovered in the 1820s) but the lake ball growth form has not been found there since around 1910. The same has happened in most locations in England and Scotland, where mainly the attached form can be found.

Dense colonies of marimo were discovered in Lake Mývatn in Iceland in 1978, but they have shrunk considerably since then. By 2014 the marimo had almost completely disappeared from the lake due to an excess of nutrients. The ecosystem is now improving and small marimo balls are forming again.

The species can still be found in several places in Japan, but populations have also declined there. At Lake Akan, a great effort is spent on the conservation of the lake balls.

The marimo has been a protected species in Japan since the 1920s, and in Iceland since 2006. Lake Akan is protected as a national park and Lake Mývatn is protected as a nature reserve.

== Cultural aspects ==
Marimo balls are a rare curiosity. In Japan, the Ainu people hold a three-day marimo festival every October at Lake Akan.

Because of their appealing appearance, the lake balls also serve as a medium for environmental education. Small balls sold as souvenirs are hand rolled from free-floating filaments. A widely marketed stuffed toy character known as Marimokkori takes the anthropomorphic form of the marimo algae as one part of its design.

Marimo are sometimes sold for display in aquariums, typically cultivated in Ukrainian lakes such as the Shatskyi Lakes. Balls sold in Japanese aquarium shops are of European origin, as collecting them from Lake Akan is prohibited. 

In the manga One Piece and its adaptation, the Straw Hat Crew&#x27;s swordsman, Zoro, is often referred to as &quot;Marimo Head&quot; due to his spiky green hair.

==Contamination==
On 2 March 2021, the United States Geological Survey was notified that zebra mussels had been discovered in moss balls sold in pet stores across North America. By 8 March, invasive zebra mussels had been detected in moss balls in 21 states. These discoveries were prompted by the initial find at a Seattle Petco. Owners of fish tanks were urged to decontaminate the moss balls by boiling, freezing, or bleaching them before disposing of them to prevent spread to local waterways. Petco and PetSmart voluntarily recalled moss balls in their stores. If the mussels reach open water in Washington, they could cost the state $100 million each year in maintenance for power and water systems.

<doc id="1148393" wikidata="Q4735152" url="?curid=1148393" title="Alpha and Omega (radio plays)">
<text>Alpha and Omega are two radio plays written by Mike Walker, first broadcast on the BBC World Service in 2001 and 2002 respectively, and later on BBC Radio 4 and BBC 7. The plays address religious and philosophical issues like the existence of God, and the question of what separates humans from robotic automata.

&quot;Alpha&quot; won the Best Radio Drama Award in the 2001 Sony Radio Awards. &quot;Omega&quot; won two Worldplay awards in 2002, for Best Script and Best Production.

Both plays star David Calder as the lead actor, featured music composed and played by David Chiltern, and were produced by Gordon House.

==Alpha==

===Themes===

&quot;Alpha&quot; examines issues of artificial intelligence from the viewpoint of established Christian teaching on the soul and human existence in the world. It addresses the existence of God and whether humans have free will or are nothing more than human automata.

===Plot===
The main character in &quot;Alpha&quot; is a priest employed by the Vatican as a sort of troubleshooter.

An all-knowing computer appears to have an independent life of its own - an abomination for those who believe in a supreme creator. Father Marquez is sent to interrogate ‘Alpha’ to decide whether or not it can be allowed to exist. During their conversations, Marquez finds out far more than he expects about both Alpha and - much more disturbingly - himself.

==Omega==

===Themes===

&quot;Omega&quot;, focuses on belief in God and in miracles, contrasting these issues with the central character&#x27;s belief in structure and reality. It addresses the question of what separates human beings from automata.
===Plot===

The central character of &quot;Omega&quot; is a civil engineer whose daughter has miraculously survived a car crash, and who comes to question his very existence. 

It tells the story of John Stone, who is building the world’s tallest tower rising above London. He discovers God after his daughter makes a miraculous recovery from a car crash. But did a miracle really take place? Perhaps John&#x27;s whole life is a fiction and he&#x27;s merely the plaything of a group of controlling scientists.

<doc id="1148408" wikidata="Q623434" url="?curid=1148408" title="Waterbuck">
<text>The waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) is a large antelope found widely in sub-Saharan Africa. It is placed in the genus &quot;Kobus&quot; of the family Bovidae. It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. Its 13 subspecies are grouped under two varieties: the common or ellipsiprymnus waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck. The head-and-body length is typically between and the typical height is between . In this sexually dimorphic antelope, males are taller and heavier than females. Males reach roughly at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh and females . Their coat colour varies from brown to grey. The long, spiral horns, present only on males, curve backward, then forward, and are long.

Waterbucks are rather sedentary in nature. As gregarious animals, they may form herds consisting of six to thirty individuals. These groups are either nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds. Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years, but are most dominant from six to nine. The waterbuck cannot tolerate dehydration in hot weather, and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water. Predominantly a grazer, the waterbuck is mostly found on grassland. In equatorial regions, breeding takes place throughout the year, but births are at their peak in the rainy season. The gestational period lasts 7–8 months, followed by the birth of a single calf.

Waterbucks inhabit scrub and savanna areas along rivers, lakes, and valleys. Due to their requirement for grasslands and water, waterbucks have a sparse ecotone distribution. The IUCN lists the waterbuck as being of least concern. More specifically, the common waterbuck is listed as of least concern, while the defassa waterbuck is near threatened. The population trend for both is downwards, especially that of the defassa, with large populations being eliminated from certain habitats because of poaching and human disturbance.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The scientific name of the waterbuck is &quot;Kobus ellipsiprymnus&quot;. The waterbuck is one of the six species of the genus &quot;Kobus&quot; in the family Bovidae. It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. The generic name &quot;Kobus&quot; is a Neo-Latin word, originating from an African name, &quot;koba&quot;. The specific name &quot;ellipsiprymnus&quot; refers to the white, elliptical ring on the rump, from the Greek &#x27; (ellipse) and &#x27; (&quot;&quot;, hind part). The animal acquired the vernacular name &quot;waterbuck&quot; due to its heavy dependence on water as compared to other antelopes and its ability to enter into water for defence.

The type specimen of the waterbuck was collected by South African hunter-explorer Andrew Steedman in 1832. This specimen was named &quot;Antilope ellipsiprymnus&quot; by Ogilby in 1833. This species was transferred to the genus &quot;Kobus&quot; in 1840, becoming &quot;K. ellipsiprymnus&quot;. It is usually known as the common waterbuck. In 1835, German naturalist Eduard Rüppell collected another specimen, which differed from Steedman&#x27;s specimen in having a prominent white ring on its rump. Considering it a separate species, Rüppell gave it the Amharic name &quot;defassa&quot; waterbuck and scientific name &quot;Antilope defassa&quot;. Modern taxonomists, however, consider the common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck a single species, &quot;K. ellipsiprymnus&quot;, given the large number of instances of hybridisation between the two. Interbreeding between the two takes place in the Nairobi National Park owing to extensive overlapping of habitats. Though both groups occur in Zambia as well, their ranges are separated by relief features or by the Muchinga escarpment. 

===Evolution===
Not many fossils of the waterbuck have been found. Fossils were scarce in the Cradle of Humankind, occurring only in a few pockets of the Swartkrans. On the basis of Valerius Geist&#x27;s theories about the relation of social evolution and dispersal in ungulates during the Pleistocene, the ancestral home of the waterbuck is considered to be the eastern coast of Africa, with the Horn of Africa to the north and the East African Rift Valley to the west.

===Subspecies===

On the basis of coat colour, 37 subspecies of the waterbucks had been initially recognised. They were classified into two groups: the ellipsiprymnus waterbuck group and the defassa waterbuck group. Owing to the large number of variations in the coat colour in the defassa waterbuck group, as many as 29 subspecies were included in it; the ellipsiprymnus waterbuck group consisted of eight subspecies. In 1971, however, the number of subspecies was reduced to 13 (4 for the ellipsenprymnus waterbuck group and 9 for the defassa waterbuck group). The subspecies are listed below, along with notes about the former subspecies which were recombined into a single subspecies:

==Description==
The waterbuck is the largest amongst the six species of &quot;Kobus&quot;. It is a sexually dimorphic antelope, with the males nearly 7% taller than females and around 8% longer. The head-and-body length is typically and the typical height is . Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females reach . The waterbuck is one of the heaviest antelopes. A newborn typically weighs , and growth in weight is faster in males than in females. Males typically weigh and females . The tail is long.

The waterbuck has a robust build. The shaggy coat is reddish brown to grey, and becomes progressively darker with age. Males are darker than females. Though apparently thick, the hair is sparse on the coat. The hair on the neck is, however, long and shaggy. When sexually excited, the skin of the waterbuck secretes a greasy substance with the odour of musk (sebum), giving it the name &quot;greasy kob&quot;. The odor of this is so unpleasant that it repels predators. This secretion also assists in water-proofing the body when the animal dives into water. The facial features include a white muzzle and light eyebrows and lighter insides of the ears. A cream-coloured patch (called &quot;bib&quot;) is on the throat. Waterbuck are characterised by a long neck and short, strong, black legs. Females have two nipples. Preorbital glands, foot glands, and inguinal glands are absent.

The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck are remarkably different in their physical appearances. Measurements indicate greater tail length in the latter, whereas the common waterbuck stands taller than the defassa waterbuck. However, the principal differentiation between the two types is the white ring of hair surrounding the tail on the rump, which is a hollow circle in the common waterbuck, but covered with white hair in the defassa waterbuck.

The long, spiral horns curve backward, then forward. Found only on males, the horns range from in length. To some extent, the length of the horns is related to the bull&#x27;s age. A rudimentary horn in the form of a bone lump may be found on the skulls of females.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature, though some migration may occur with the onset of monsoon. A gregarious animal, the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals. The various groups are the nursery herds, bachelor herds and territorial males. Herd size increases in summer, whereas groups fragment in the winter months, probably under the influence of food availability. As soon as young males start developing horns (at around seven to nine months of age), they are chased out of the herd by territorial bulls. These males then form bachelor herds and may roam in female home ranges. Females have home ranges stretching over . A few females may form spinster herds. Though females are seldom aggressive, minor tension may arise in herds.

Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of 5 years, but are most dominant from 6 to 9 years. Territorial males hold territories in size. Males are inclined to remain settled in their territories, though over time they may leave inferior territories for more spacious ones. Marking of territories includes no elaborate rituals; dung and urine are occasionally dropped. After the age of ten years, males lose their territorial nature and are replaced by a younger bull, following which they recede to a small and unprotected area. There is another social group, that of the satellite males, which are mature bulls as yet without their own territories, who exploit resources, particularly mating opportunities, even in the presence of the dominant bull. The territorial male may allow a few satellite males into his territory, and they may contribute to its defence. However, gradually they may deprive the actual owner of his territory and seize the area for themselves. In a study in the Lake Nakuru National Park, only 7 percent of the adult males held territories, and only half of the territorial males tolerated one or more satellite males.

Territorial males may use several kinds of display. In one type of display, the white patch on the throat and between the eyes is clearly revealed, and other displays can demonstrate the thickness of the neck. These activities frighten trespassers. Lowering of the head and the body depict submission before the territorial male, who stands erect. Fights, which may last up to thirty minutes, involve threat displays typical of bovids accompanied by snorting. Fights may even become so violent that one of the opponents meets its death due to severe abdominal or thoracic wounds. A silent animal, the waterbuck makes use of flehmen response for visual communication and alarm snorts for vocal communication. Waterbuck often enter water to escape from predators which include lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles (leopards and hyenas prey on juveniles). However, it has been observed that the waterbuck does not particularly like being in water. Waterbuck may run into cover when alarmed, and males often attack predators.

===Diseases and parasites===

Waterbucks are susceptible to ulcers, lungworm infections, and kidney stones. Other diseases from which these animals suffer are foot-and-mouth disease, sindbis fever, yellow fever, bluetongue, bovine virus diarrhoea, brucellosis, and anthrax. They are more resistant to rinderpest than are other antelopes. They are unaffected by tsetse flies because they produce volatiles which act as repellents. Waterbuck odor volatiles are under testing and development as repellents to protect livestock. However ticks may introduce parasitic protozoa such as &quot;Theileria parva&quot;, &quot;Anaplasma marginale&quot;, and &quot;Baberia bigemina&quot;; 27 species of ixodid ticks have been found on waterbucks - a healthy waterbuck may carry over 4000 ticks in their larval or nymphal stages, the most common among them being &quot;Amblyomma cohaerens&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus tricuspis&quot;. Internal parasites found in waterbuck include tapeworms, liver flukes, stomach flukes, and several helminths.

==Diet==

The waterbuck exhibits great dependence on water. It can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather, and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water. However, it has been observed that unlike the other members of its genus (such as the kob and puku), the waterbuck ranges farther into the woodlands while maintaining its proximity to water. With grasses constituting a substantial 70 to 95 percent of the diet, the waterbuck is predominantly a grazer frequenting grasslands. Reeds and rushes like &quot;Typha&quot; and &quot;Phragmites&quot; may also be preferred. A study found regular consumption of three grass species round the year: &quot;Panicum anabaptistum&quot;, &quot;Echinochloa stagnina&quot; and &quot;Andropogon gayanus&quot;. &quot;Hyparrhenia involucrata&quot;, &quot;Acroceras amplectens&quot; and &quot;Oryza barthii&quot; along with annual species were the main preference in the early rainy season, while long life grasses and forage from trees constituted three-fourths of the diet in the dry season.

Though the defassa waterbuck was found to have a much greater requirement for protein than the African buffalo and the Beisa oryx, the waterbuck was found to spend much less time on browsing (eating leaves, small shoots, and fruits) in comparison to the other grazers. In the dry season, about 32% of the 24-hour day was spent in browsing, whereas no time was spent on it during the wet season. The choice of grasses varies with location rather than availability; for instance, in western Uganda, while &quot;Sporobolus pyramidalis&quot; was favoured in some places, &quot;Themeda triandra&quot; was the main choice elsewhere. The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck in the same area may differ in their choices; while the former preferred &quot;Heteropogon contortus&quot; and &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, the latter showed less preference for these grasses.

==Reproduction==

Waterbuck are slower than other antelopes in terms of the rate of maturity. While males become sexually mature at the age of six years, females reach maturity within two to three years. Females may conceive by the age of two-and-a-half years, and remain reproductive for another ten years. In equatorial regions, breeding takes place throughout the year, and births are at their peak in the rainy season. However, breeding is seasonal in the Sudan (south of Sahara), with the mating season lasting four months. The season extends for even longer periods in some areas of southern Africa. Oestrus lasts for a day or less.

Mating begins after the male confirms that the female is in oestrus, which he does by sniffing her vulva and urine. A resistive female would try to bite or even fight off an advancing male. The male exhibits flehmen, and often licks the neck of the female and rubs his face and the base of his horns against her back. There are several attempts at mounting before the actual copulation. The female shifts her tail to one side, while the male clasps her sides with his forelegs and rests on her back during copulation, which may occur as many as ten times.

The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months, followed by the birth of a single calf. Twins are rare. Pregnant females isolate themselves in thickets as parturition approaches. Newborn calves can stand on their feet within a half-hour of birth. The mother eats the afterbirth. She communicates with the calf by bleating or snorting. Calves are kept hidden from two to three weeks up to two months. At about three to four weeks, the calf begins following its mother, who signals it to do so by raising her tail. Though bereft of horns, mothers will fiercely defend their offspring from predators. Calves are weaned at eight months, following which time they join groups of calves of their own age. Young females remain with their mothers in nursery herds, or may also join bachelor herds. The waterbuck lives to 18 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==

The waterbuck is native to southern and eastern Africa (including countries such as Angola, Botswana, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda) besides a few countries of western and northern Africa such as Chad, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. Though formerly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, its numbers have now decreased in most areas.

The common waterbuck is found east of the Eastern African Rift. Its southern range extends to the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve (KwaZulu Natal) and to central Namibia. By contrast, the defassa waterbuck inhabits western and central Africa. The defassa waterbuck occurs west of the Albertine Rift and ranges from Eritrea to Guinea Bissau in the southern Sahel, its most northerly point of distribution being in southern Mali. Its range also stretches east of the Congo Basin through Zambia into Angola, while another branch extends to the Zaire River west of the Congo Basin. While the common waterbuck is now extinct in Ethiopia, the defassa waterbuck has become extinct in Gambia.

Waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas alongside rivers, lakes and valleys. Due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water, the waterbuck have a sparse distribution across ecotones (areas of interface between two different ecosystems). A study in the Ruwenzori Range showed that the mean density of waterbuck was 5.5 per square mile, and estimates in the Maasai Mara were as low as 1.3 per square mile. It has been observed that territorial size depends on the quality of the habitat, the age and health of the animal and the population density. The greater the age of the animal or the denser the populations, the smaller are the territories. In Queen Elizabeth National Park, females had home ranges in area whereas home ranges for bachelor males averaged between . The oldest female (around 18 years old) had the smallest home range.

==Threats and conservation==
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) lists the waterbuck as of least concern (LC). More specifically, the common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern while the defassa waterbuck is near threatened (NT). The population trend for both the common and defassa waterbuck is decreasing, especially that of the latter, with large populations being eliminated from their habitats due to poaching and human settlement. Their own sedentary nature too is responsible for this to some extent. Numbers have fallen in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Akagera National Park, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Comoé National Park. Population decrease in the Lake Nakuru National Park has been attributed to heavy metal poisoning. While cadmium and lead levels were dangerously high in the kidney and the liver, deficiencies of copper, calcium and phosphorus were noted.

Over 60 percent of the defassa waterbuck populations thrive in protected areas, most notably in Niokolo-Koba, Comoe, Mole, Bui, Pendjari, Manovo-Gounda St. Floris, Moukalaba-Doudou, Garamba, Virunga, Omo, Mago, Murchison Falls, Serengeti, and Katavi, Kafue and Queen Elizabeth National Parks, the national parks and hunting zones of North Province (Cameroon), Ugalla River Forest Reserve, Nazinga Game Ranch, Rukwa Valley, Awash Valley, Murule and Arly-Singou. The common waterbuck occurs in Tsavo, Tarangire, Mikumi, Kruger and Lake Nakuru National Parks, Laikipia, Kajiado, Luangwa Valley, Selous and Hluhluwe-Umfolozi game reserves and private lands in South Africa.

==Research==
Scientists with the ICIPE have developed tsetse-fly-repellant collars for cattle based on the smell of the waterbuck.

<text>John Wood (born 14 July 1946) is an Australian television Gold Logie Award-winning actor and scriptwriter.

Wood has appeared in numerous theatre and TV productions, but is best known for his roles in the legal drama &quot;Rafferty&#x27;s Rules&quot; as Stipendiary Magistrate Michael Rafferty and in the long-running police drama &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, as Tom Croydon both for the Seven Network.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Wood began his acting career in 1966, attending National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and doing a play called &quot;Eh?&quot; directed by Max Gillies and co-starring Tony Taylor. In 1970 he became a professional actor and worked for the Old Tote Theatre Company in a production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

===Career-Television===

His first professional TV role was in &quot;Minus Five&quot; with Ken James and Rowena Wallace which went to air with the title &quot;Barrier Reef&quot;.
A common misconception is that his first role was a guest role in &quot;Bellbird&quot;, an Australian television series. He then appeared in several Australian drama series and mini-series in minor roles. He played the co-lead role of Stokey in the ABC drama series &quot;The Truckies&quot; in 1978, writing an episode. John also wrote eleven episodes of the series &quot;Prisoner&quot;, and several episodes of &quot;Cop Shop&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until 1987 that John Wood became a well-known actor, taking the lead in &quot;Rafferty&#x27;s Rules&quot;, as magistrate Michael Rafferty. Wood twice won a Logie for &quot;Most Outstanding Actor&quot; for his role in the show during its four seasons.

In 1993 Wood landed a leading role in &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; as Tom Croydon. This show became a big hit in Australia. As well as starring in the show, he also wrote several episodes. The show was cancelled in 2006, and Wood is one of only two actors (the other being Julie Nihill) to star in &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; from its beginning in 1993 to its end in 2006, although Wood&#x27;s character is the only one to be seen in every single episode. Wood also wrote three episodes for the series.

In 2005 he hosted the mini-documentary series &quot;Made in Melbourne&quot; about 50 years of HSV7.

Wood was a contestant in the 2004 edition of the Australian &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. In 2007, Wood appeared on Channel Ten&#x27;s tele-movie, &quot;Joanne Lees: Murder in the Outback&quot;, where he played barrister Grant Algie. He currently hosts Channel Nine&#x27;s travel series &quot;Wine Me, Dine Me&quot;.

<doc id="1148423" wikidata="Q6520415" url="?curid=1148423" title="Leithfield">
<text>Leithfield is a small town in north Canterbury, New Zealand. It is on State Highway 1, south of Amberley and north of Christchurch and 11.8 kilometres north of Waikuku. The Leithfield area consists of two semi-distinct areas, Leithfield Beach to the east of State Highway 1 and Leithfield Village adjacent to and immediately to the west of State Highway 1. Leithfield sits just south of the South Branch of the Kowai River.

Leithfield&#x27;s regional importance is behind that of Amberley with its wine industry and the tourist centre of Hanmer Springs. This is due in large part to its proximity to the district centre at Amberley. Despite this proximity, the Leithfield community supports a school, library, summer swimming pool, and many small businesses.

== History ==
Leithfield was founded in 1857 by John Leith. He purchased a windmill in 1862 and brought it from Christchurch to Leithfield in order to mill wheat. The mill building was 23 metres tall and each sail was 12 metres long making it the tallest building in Canterbury at the time. Unfortunately the Canterbury nor&#x27;westerly winds damaged the mill building making it inoperable. In 1880, Leithfield was a town of 700 people. It had three churches, a police station, a court, a school, three hotels and five shops.

<text>Waipara is a wine and tourism district in Canterbury, New Zealand, on the banks of the Waipara River. Its name translates to &quot;Muddy Water&quot;, &quot;wai&quot; meaning water and &quot;para&quot; meaning mud.

It is at the junction of state highways 1 and 7, on the Alpine Pacific Touring Route. It is 60 kilometres north of Christchurch, and Hanmer Springs is 76 kilometres (55 minutes drive) to the north-west. It is also situated on the Main North Line railway and the historic Weka Pass Railway.

Waipara lies at one of the points of the Alpine Pacific Triangle, which also includes the major tourist centres of Hanmer Springs and Kaikōura.

The Weka Pass Railway has its base in Waipara, and runs on 12 kilometres of track between there and Waikari over the former route of the Waiau Branch, a branch line railway that diverged from the Main North Line and ran to Waiau. The Glenmark station is based in Waipara.

The Glenmark church reopened in December 2023, having been damaged during the 2010 Christchurch earthquakes and then closed for repairs. The Waipara Hotel burnt down in 2014. It was not insured at the time and has not been replaced.

The Waipara region has a reputation as a premium area for the production of Pinot noir, Riesling and Chardonnay. Waipara is sheltered by the Teviot hills from the prevailing cool easterly winds and has the highest summer temperatures and the lowest rainfall of any of the New Zealand wine regions. Because of this, Waipara has over 26 wineries and 80 vineyards within the valley, which collectively produce around 100,000 cases of award-winning wine in an average year. Many of the vineyards offer tastings at their cellar doors and some also have restaurants attached.

There are a number of day walks close in Waipara including Tiromoana Bush Walkway and the Mt Cass Walkway which is closed during lambing season. Waipara would have been once been covered in tōtara, lacebark, kōwhai, lancewood and broadleaf forest. It is now predominantly vineyards. There have been a number of ongoing projects to increase the biodiversity of the area. Work is ongoing to plant native species in Waipara&#x27;s shelter belts, stream boundaries, pond edges and vineyard borders. These have provided benefits in pollination, pest control and weed suppression. It has worked so well that the plantings have resulted in a drop in the use of pesticides in the vineyards. The Waipara Environmental Trapping Association (WETA) is aiming to trap rats and other introduced species with the aim of making Waipara a predator-free paradise for native birds.

In 2023 Australian-owned company Far North Solar Farm Ltd applied for consent to build a 180-hectare solar farm in Waipara on a site located between vineyards and the Alpine-Pacific Touring Route. The application attracted local opposition and a community group was established to oppose the proposal.

She graduated 10 years later, on February 19, 2010. The delay was due to her continuous work since her debut after she entered the university. She also received an alumni association award for her contributions to the university during the graduation rites.

==Career==
===Music===
Jang made her debut in the entertainment world as a singer in May 2001. She started her singing career by becoming a trainee and by signing a contract with SM Entertainment.

Jang released her debut album &quot;First Story&quot; with the title track &quot;Burying My Face In Tears&quot;. Initially, it was not well-received and only reached number 12 in Korean music charts. After starring in the popular sitcom &quot;New Nonstop&quot;, she became more well-known and released the other tracks in the album such as her pop ballad style song, &quot;Confession&quot; and the &quot;April Story&quot;, ranked at the top in various music charts. The album sold 300,000 copies. Jang then became a host for MBC&#x27;s music show, &quot;Music Camp&quot; and KBS&#x27;s talk show &quot;Love Story&quot;. By the end of 2001, she received several New Female Artist awards from year-end Music Awards ceremonies and New MC awards from Entertainment Awards ceremonies.

In October 2002, Jang released her second album, &quot;Jjang Nara Vol.2 Sweet Dream&quot;. The song &quot;Sweet Dream&quot; became immensely popular and reached number 1 in Korean music charts, instantly making Jang a household name. The album also became one of the top selling albums of that year in South Korea. Due to the success of &quot;Sweet Dream&quot;, Jang won several awards, including two &quot;Daesang&quot; awards or the Grand Prize (equivalent to Korean Top Artist of the Year) from MBC Music Festival and KBS Music Awards. She also received the Korean Singer of the Year from China&#x27;s CCTV-MTV Awards in 2003.

With her popularity in China, she also made a career in music overseas by releasing Chinese-language albums. Her first Chinese album was a huge success, making her the first foreign artist in China with over 1 million copies sold. This was followed by the release of two more Chinese albums, &quot;Kungfu&quot; (2005) and &quot;Flying High&quot; (2006).

She returned to the Korean music scene in 2007 with her fifth Korean album entitled &quot;She&quot;, which consists of medium tempo &quot;Masquerade&quot; and the dance piece, &quot;You &amp; I&quot;. The following year, she released a multi-lingual album titled &quot;Dream of Asia&quot;, which includes 26 songs in 5 languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, and English. Jang held a mini concert in Beijing to promote the album.

<text>MareNostrum (, ) is the main supercomputer in the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. It is the most powerful supercomputer in Spain, one of thirteen supercomputers in the Spanish Supercomputing Network and one of the seven supercomputers of the European infrastructure PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe).

MareNostrum runs SUSE Linux 11 SP3. It occupies 180 m² (less than half a basketball court).

The supercomputer is used in human genome research, protein research, astrophysical simulations, weather forecasting, geological or geophysical modeling, and the design of new drugs. It was booted up for the first time on 12 April 2005, and is available to the national and international scientific community.

&quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (&quot;our sea&quot;) was the Roman name for the Mediterranean Sea. The supercomputer is housed in the deconsecrated Chapel Torre Girona at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.

== MareNostrum 5 ==
In July 2019, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking selected the Barcelona Supercomputing Center as one of the entities that will host a pre-exascale supercomputer in the high-capacity supercomputer network promoted by the European Commission. It was expected that MareNostrum 5 became operational on December 31, 2020, but its deployment got delayed until December 2023. It will include an experimental platform dedicated to testing and developing European supercomputing technologies.

== MareNostrum 4 ==

MareNostrum 4 has been dubbed the most diverse and likely the most interesting supercomputer in the world thanks to the heterogeneity of the architecture it will include once the installation of the supercomputer is complete. Its total speed will be 13.7 petaflops. It has five storage racks with the capacity to store 14 petabytes (14 million gigabytes) of data. A high-speed Omni-Path network connects all the components in the supercomputer to one another.

The supercomputer includes two separate parts: a general-purpose block and a block featuring emerging technologies.

The general-purpose block has 48 racks with 3,456 Lenovo ThinkSystem SD530 compute nodes. Each node has two Intel Xeon Platinum chips, each with 24 processors, amounting to a total of 165,888 processors and main memory of 390  terabytes. Its peak performance is 11.15  petaflops. While its performance is 10 times greater than its predecessor, MareNostrum 3, its electricity consumption only increased by 30% to 1.3 MW.

The block of emerging technologies is formed of clusters of three different technologies, which will be incorporated and updated as they become available on the market. These technologies are currently being developed in the United States and Japan to speed up the arrival of the new generation of pre-exascale supercomputers. They are as follows:

* Cluster comprising IBM POWER9 and NVIDIA Volta GPUs, with a computational capacity of over 1.5  petaflops. IBM and NVIDIA will use these processors for the Summit and Sierra supercomputers that the US Department of Energy has ordered for its Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
* Cluster made up of AMD Rome processors and AMD Radeon Instinct MI50. The machine will have a processor and accelerator similar to the Frontier supercomputer that will be installed in 2021 at ORNL. The computing power of the machine will be 0.52 Petaflop/s.
* Cluster formed of 64-bit ARMv8 processors in a prototype machine, using state-of-the-art technologies from the Japanese Post-K supercomputer. Computing power over 0.65 Petaflop/s.

The aim of gradually incorporating these emerging technologies into MareNostrum 4 is to allow BSC to experiment with what are expected to be the most advanced technological developments over the next few years and evaluate their suitability for future iterations of MareNostrum.

MareNostrum 4 has a disk storage capacity of 14 petabytes and is connected to BSC’s big data facilities, which have a total capacity of 24.6 petabytes. Like its predecessors, MareNostrum 4 will also be connected to European research centres and European universities via the RedIRIS and GÉANT networks.

==MareNostrum 3==

The previous version, MareNostrum 3, consisted of 3,056 IBM iDataPlex DX360M4 compute nodes, for a total of 48,896 physical Intel Sandy Bridge cores running at 2.6 GHz, and 84 Xeon Phi 5110P in 42 nodes. MareNostrum 3 had 36 racks dedicated to calculations. In total, each rack had 1,344 cores and 2,688 GB of memory. Each IBM iDataPlex Compute rack was composed of 84 IBM iDataPlex dx360 M4 compute nodes and four Mellanox 36-port Managed FDR10 IB Switches. dx360 M4 compute nodes were grouped into a 2U Chassis, having two columns of 42 2U chassis.

The computing nodes of MareNostrum 3 communicated primarily through a high bandwidth, low latency InfiniBand FDR10 network. The different nodes were interconnected via fibre optic cables and Mellanox 648-port FDR10 Infiniband Core Switches. In addition, there was a more traditional local area network consisting of Gigabit Ethernet adapters.

==MareNostrum 2==
These older version has been based on a 2,560 IBM BladeCenter JS21 nodes with PowerPC 970MP processors and with 20 TB system memory.

<doc id="1148443" wikidata="Q7598211" url="?curid=1148443" title="Standard Corridor">
<text>The Second Corridor (previously Third Corridor) type of railway carriage was one of the standard mid-20th century designs, and was coded SK (previously TK) by the LNER and BR, and CF by the LMS. The layout of the coach was a number of compartments, all of which were second class (known as third class until 1956), linked by a side corridor.

The British Railways Mark 1 SK was the most numerous carriage design ever built in the United Kingdom. The original number series carried was 24000–26217. From 1983, those carriages in the 25xxx and 26xxx series were renumbered 18xxx and 19xxx.

There were two variants, those built for the Midland, Scottish, and Eastern / North Eastern regions had six seats per compartment, with fold-up arm-rests which folded into the seat-back, while those built for the Southern and Western regions, with their heavy commuter loadings into London, had eight seats in each compartment, and no arm-rests. Seating was of the interior sprung bench type. Over time, some SKs and BSKs were re-allocated from other regions to the Western, who tended to try to stitch the arm-rests in the up position.

In 1985, a number of Mark 2 First Corridor carriages were declassified to become SKs. They were renumbered from 13xxx to 19xxx, putting them after the end of the Mark 1 range (19452–19560).

No carriages of this type are still in daily use on the main line network, since open saloon carriages are now preferred by operating companies. However, some electric multiple units based on Mark 1 coaches have standard class compartments, such as . Many SKs still operate on preserved UK railway lines.

Designations for second corridor carriages are as follows:

==Livery==
In 1951 the initial livery for Mk1 coaches on British Railways was crimson lake and cream with black and gold lining, and all new Mk1 SK coaches were delivered in this livery up until 1956. In 1956 the standard livery changed to maroon with black and gold lining, except for the Southern region stock which adopted an unlined dark malachite green. Western Region adopted chocolate and cream on sufficient stock to operate its named trains such as the Cornish Riviera Express and the Torbay Express. In 1965 Manastral Blue &amp; Grey livery was introduced as trailed on XP64 stock the year before and was the network standard for over 20 years. In the 1980s the NSE livery of white with blue at window level and red stripe under was introduced for stock in the south east of England.

==Orders==
==Conversions==
* In 1973-74 4 Second Corridor were converted to Class 309 TSK later become TSOL 
* In 1976, 9 Second Corridor were converted to Stowage Vans 80431-80439 POT
* In 1977, 15 Second Corridor were converted to Sorting Vans 80381-80395 POS.

===Departmental use===

==Corridor Brake Standard/Second==
A second corridor coach with a guard&#x27;s brake compartment is designated BSK. The Mark 1 BSKs had 4 compartments, built as two variants with or without arm-rests depending on region, as with the SKs.

<text>Adriaen Pietersz van de Venne (1589 – 12 November 1662), was a versatile Dutch Golden Age painter of allegories, genre subjects, and portraits, as well as a miniaturist, book illustrator, designer of political satires, and versifier.

==Biography==
Van de Venne was born in Delft. According to Houbraken he learned Latin in Leiden. He learned to paint from the master goldsmith and painter Simon de Valk, and afterwards learned engraving from Jeronimus van Diest, a good painter of grisailles. He then moved to Middelburg in 1614 where he was influenced by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Elder. His political painting &quot;Fishing for Souls&quot;, 1614, is an ironic commentary on the Catholic and Protestant troubles of the Eighty Years War that split the border between the Northern from the Southern Netherlands along the Schelde river, very close to his home in Middleburg. When he painted this picture, the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce was in effect since 1609. The influence of Jan Brueghel the Elder is particularly evident in this allegory of religious fanaticism.

From 1620 until his death van de Venne made many grisailles and engravings of genre subjects, featuring peasants, beggars, thieves and fools as illustrations of current proverbs and sayings, mostly by Jacob Cats. This work made him famous during his lifetime, and remained popular throughout the 18th century after his death.

Van de Venne also worked as a book illustrator and print designer. Van de Venne moved to The Hague and joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1625, taking the position of dean in 1637. He was a founding member of Confrerie Pictura, a group bent on improving the independent status and social position of the artist in Dutch society by encouraging a more academic approach to the arts. He died in The Hague.

<text>The Ashley River (; officially Ashley River / Rakahuri) is in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. It flows generally southeastwards for before entering the Pacific Ocean at Waikuku Beach, Pegasus Bay north of Christchurch. The town of Rangiora is close to the south bank of the Ashley River. The river&#x27;s official name was changed from Ashley River to the dual name Ashley River / Rakahuri by the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

Though the lower reaches of the river are braided, part of the upper river flows through a canyon known as the Ashley Gorge.

The river emanates from mountains in the west Lees Valley adjacent to Island Hills station and exits the hills at a gorge near Oxford township. It has tributaries of Duck Creek in this valley and is an accumulator of watershed between Lees Valley and Oxford township.

Behind Waikuku Beach is one of the largest, least modified estuaries in New Zealand. It is abundant in bird life, including the wrybill (&quot;Anarhynchus frontalis&quot;) and Black stilt (&quot;Himantopus novaezelandiae&quot;). Many migratory birds over-winter here. Surveys from 2000 to 2015, after work to clear weeds and pests, showed significant increases in banded dotterel, wrybill, black-fronted tern, and pied stilt, but black-billed gull, spur-winged plover and southern black-backed gull didn&#x27;t change significantly.

== Floods ==
In February 1868, June 1905 and May 1923 flooding from this river extended as far as Kaiapoi. Major floods also occurred in March 1902, February 1936, March 1941, February 1945, January 1953, December 1993 and 2013. of stopbanks have been built from the 1930s and have contained the floods since 1953, being enlarged in 1976 and 2018. On the north bank they extend from the railway bridge to the coast and on the south bank to Mount Thomas Road.

==Bridges ==

=== Cones Road Bridge ===

The Cones Road Bridge is located at and connects Rangiora to Ashley and Loburn. It is a 10-span, long bridge, opened in 2015, replacing a 24-span, 1912 bridge, after closure by floods in 2013. It is built of hollow-core concrete beams and has 2 road lanes, 2 cycleways and a footpath. The original bridge was built in 1897.
=== Railway Bridge ===
The bridge opened with the Rangiora to Ashley section of the Northern Railway on 17 April 1875. It was long and built of timber, with 54 spans. In April 1951 a pier and two iron girders were washed away in a flood. It was replaced by a bridge to the east on 18 December 1961.

=== Main North Road Bridge ===
The first bridge was completed in 1866. It was initially a toll bridge, but by 1867 had been bought by the Provincial Council. After floods, it was lengthened in 1868. It was rebuilt downstream and long by wide, on 25 reinforced concrete spans, opening in August 1937, after flood damage in 1936. Floods had also closed it in 1870, It is now part of State Highway 1 and was repaired and strengthened in 2019.

<doc id="1148454" wikidata="Q173001" url="?curid=1148454" title="David Brabham">
<text>David Philip Brabham (born 5 September 1965) is an Australian racing driver and one of the most successful and experienced specialists in sports car racing. He has won three international Sports Car series and is one of four Australians to have won the Le Mans 24 Hour sports car race, winning the event in . Brabham won the American Le Mans Series in 2009 and 2010. He also competed in Formula One, racing for the Brabham and Simtek teams in 1990 and 1994, respectively. Brabham is the youngest son of three-time Formula One world champion Sir Jack Brabham, brother to Geoff Brabham and Gary Brabham. He is also brother-in-law to Mike Thackwell, father to Sam Brabham and uncle to Matthew Brabham.

==Early life==
Brabham, who was born in Wimbledon, London, spent his childhood in Australia. Despite his father&#x27;s motor racing fame he took little interest in motor racing until after he left school. As a child he played soccer up until the age of twelve and then took up Australian rules football when the family moved to Sydney. Growing up, Sir Jack did not force David into racing, and it was only after discovering go-karts at 17, that he became enthusiastic enough to purchase a second-hand go-kart with his next-door neighbour and to begin racing.

==Motor racing career==

===Early career===
Brabham&#x27;s professional racing career began in Australia in 1983, racing karts for two years, after which he moved into the Ford Laser &quot;one make&quot; series for 1985. In 1986 he switched to Formula Ford 1600 and subsequently to Australian Formula 2, winning the 1987 Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship in that category. The 1987 ADC was, unlike previous years, only held as a single race rather than a series of rounds and was run as a support category to the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide. After starting 38th on the grid due to carburettor and electrical problems with his Ralt RT30 Volkswagen in qualifying, he caught and passed leader Rohan Onslow on lap 13 of the 15 lap race and went on to a 1.7 second victory.

He also competed in the New Zealand Formula Atlantic series, the American Formula Atlantic series and in the South American Formula 3 Championship during the 1987 season. A move from Australia to Europe under sponsorship from Camel in 1989 saw him joining the Bowman team and winning the British Formula Three Championship.

===Formula One career===

Brabham&#x27;s break into Formula One in with the Brabham team met with little success. He had raised a considerable amount of sponsorship to join the team bearing his family name (though it had been sold on three times since) but financial constraints hindered the team all season. While David had been hired to drive ahead of the season he requested to skip the first two races to prepare himself, Gregor Foitek taking the seat instead. Ironically his brother Gary attempted to qualify for the first two rounds in the ill-fated Life before quitting; the brothers therefore both contested the 1990 season without actually entering any of the same meetings.

His first outing with the team was the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix where he failed to qualify. His first Formula One start came at the next race in Monaco where his father Jack had won in 1959, his first championship year. In 14 races he only managed to qualify the uncompetitive Judd-engined car six times, including the last race of the year at home in Australia. This, and David being unable to raise the reported $3m needed to keep his place in the team, led to him being replaced at the end of the season. Brabham joined the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Jaguar team in 1991 and also in that year won the Spa 24 Hours driving a Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R alongside Naoki Hattori and Anders Olofsson.

Brabham returned to Formula One in with the under-funded Simtek team after his father bought shares in the team. The second seat was to be filled by paying drivers, with Roland Ratzenberger taking the first five races before Jean-Marc Gounon took over. The S941 chassis was overweight, used a fully manual gearbox as opposed to the semi-automatic types used by most teams and inferior wire-spring Cosworth HB customer engines. Despite this Brabham qualified for every round of the series.
The team suffered the blow of the death of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix. Traditionally the other team driver would withdraw in such a situation, but seeing the demoralisation around him, Brabham decided to race on, only to crash out after a suspension failure of his own. In Ratzenberger&#x27;s memory the team made a collective decision to see out the season, with Brabham&#x27;s strong leadership often cited as a key factor. While the Simtek was uncompetitive he won considerable acclaim for his determination and for gradually improving the speed of the underfunded package, also handily out-performing his various teammates.

===Touring Cars===

Brabham quit Formula One at the end of that year to begin touring car racing – while he wanted to help Simtek the salary offered by the BMW works team was too good to ignore. 1995 in a BTCC BMW was not a success, but subsequent successes included winning the 1996 JGTC GT500 championship in McLaren F1 GTR (so far the only non-Japanese team car to win this), and the 1997 AMP Bathurst 1000 in its Super Touring era. Driving a BMW 320i at Bathurst with brother Geoff, the pair were flagged in 2nd but were elevated to the win soon after the finish when their BMW Motorsport Australia teammates Paul Morris and Craig Baird were disqualified, the team making an error at the last pit stop by not doing a driver change and leaving Baird in the car for the run home, not realising that he would exceed his allowed driving time before the race ended.

He won the Professional Sports Car Championship in the United States with the Panoz racing team in 1998, and the 1999 Petit Le Mans race also with Panoz.
===GT racing===
Brabham joined Sumo Power GT for the 2011 FIA GT1 World Championship, teaming with Jamie Campbell-Walter in a Nissan GT-R. The duo finished 10th in the driver&#x27;s championship. He will join the Blancpain Endurance Series in 2012, driving a McLaren MP4-12C for United Autosports.

===Sports car racing===

Since 1999 he has been a regular in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS), having raced for teams such as Panoz and Prodrive Ferrari 550 Maranello. He won the Sebring 12-hour race in 2005. In Australia, he has contested the Bathurst 24 Hour race and continued to make occasional appearances in the Bathurst 1000.

Brabham has won a total of 23 ALMS events across all four classes in the series. He is a two-time champion in the series, winning the LMP1 title in 2009 and LMP title in 2010.

In 2003, Brabham won first-in-class (4th overall) with Multimatic Motorsports at the 24 Hours of Daytona, the Daytona Prototype category&#x27;s inaugural race. Brabham finished second at the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans driving for Bentley. In 2005 he started the first of four consecutive Le Mans starts racing Aston Martin DBR9&#x27;s. He finished ninth overall and third in the GT1 Class for Aston Martin Racing. At the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, Brabham scored a fourth in the GT1 category (ninth overall) driving for Russian Age Racing. Brabham won the GT1 class of the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans and again in the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans driving for Aston Martin Racing.

Driving for Peugeot, he won the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans outright with co-drivers Alexander Wurz and Marc Gené driving a Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. He joined brother Geoff as a Le Mans winner with his older brother having also won for Peugeot in 1993. It also saw him join his father and older brother as an outright winner at Le Mans with father Jack having won the only French Grand Prix held at the Bugatti Circuit in 1967.

David Brabham became only the fourth Australian driver to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans following Bernard Rubin in 1928, Vern Schuppan in 1983, and older brother Geoff in 1993.

Brabham won the 2009 and 2010 American Le Mans Series LMP championship, driving for Highcroft Racing. For 2012, he will compete in the FIA World Endurance Championship in a JRM Racing Honda Performance Development ARX-03a.
==Project Brabham==
In the Autumn of 2014, Project Brabham was announced as an innovative and new way of setting up a motor racing team. The project is aimed at integrating the public and fans with the team. The initial start-up of the project was run via crowdfunding through the Indiegogo portal, where members of the public and fans alike could become part of the team.

″The money from the first phase of crowdfunding has been used to build this first stage Brabham-Digital website. We also created the all-important investor prospectus, which is vital in searching for and securing the investment required to build and launch both the team and Brabham-Digital platform&quot;

The project is still gathering much needed investment to get the team onto the track with the aim to become part of the FIA World Endurance championship.

&quot;Our complete focus is now on finding and signing the investors and partners that will be vital in securing the investment required to make this vision a reality. When that investment is secured, the full Brabham-Digital platform will be developed and built, evolving into a much more engaging and powerful engine, divided into the three different knowledge sharing and e-learning platforms.&quot;

==Brabham Automotive==

Brabham launched Brabham Automotive in May 2018. Its first product is the Brabham BT62. Brabham drove the car on its racing debut at Brands Hatch on 9 and 10 November, participating in Britcar&#x27;s annual &#x27;Into the Night&#x27; races. He was joined in the car by Will Powell. He drove the car home to victory at Brands Hatch as a remarkable win, the Brabham BT62&#x27;s first ever race and win and Brabham Automotive&#x27;s first car and win. In a post-race interview he referred to his father&#x27;s win at the 1966 British Grand Prix who won in a Brabham BT19.

==Family==

Brabham&#x27;s two older brothers Geoff and Gary also pursued motor racing careers. His wife Lisa (sister of Mike Thackwell) also raced. His son Sam Brabham and nephew Matthew Brabham now race in junior formulae.

Lisa Brabham () was born in in New Zealand and moved with her family to Perth, Western Australia at an early age. The family then moved to England in 1976 when she was eleven. She first drove a racing car, a Renault 5 Cup, aged 21 through her father (Ray Thackwell)&#x27;s business connections. After one season in Renault 5, she switched to the Honda CRX Challenge with Edenbridge Racing. She raced in the British Rover GTi Championship in 1992. Brabham and Thackwell married in 1993. She was still racing in 1994 but appears to have retired soon after. They have two sons – Sam and Finn.

<text>Dennis Haskins (born November 18, 1950) is an American actor known for his role as Principal Richard Belding in the teen sitcom &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, which ran from 1989 to 1993 on NBC. He then went on to star in &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;, which aired from 1993 to 2000. He also portrayed the role as a regular in &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Haskins is an alumnus of Our Lady of Perpetual Help as well as Notre Dame High School in Chattanooga and of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He played basketball at UTC after failing to make the team at the University of Tennessee. He was also a member of the cheerleading squad. Haskins is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. Dennis Haskins currently splits his time between Los Angeles and Winthrop, Massachusetts.

Before breaking into acting, Haskins was a contestant on the TV game shows &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; and &quot;Scrabble&quot;.

==Career==
===Television and film===
Before his role on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, Haskins appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; in different roles. In the pilot episode, he plays a Boar&#x27;s Nest patron whom Daisy thrashes after he attempts to grope her while she&#x27;s working as a waitress.

Haskins, who auditioned seven times for the role of Mr. Belding, first appeared as the character in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; on the Disney Channel. After a year the show was retooled as &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; on NBC, with Haskins being the only adult member of the regular cast. Known for the catchphrase &quot;Hey, hey, hey, what is going on here?&quot;, he continued the role on the spinoff &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; until 2000. He had a brief cameo as himself in the 2006 film &quot;The Boys &amp; Girls Guide to Getting Down&quot;.

As a guest on the March 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Haskins boasted he was capable of bench pressing 150 pounds as a senior member of Notre Dame men&#x27;s varsity basketball team.

On February 4, 2015, Haskins reunited with Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Elizabeth Berkley, Mario Lopez and Tiffani Thiessen on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; where they appeared in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sketch with Fallon.

He appeared in the 2014 film &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; as a snake oil salesman at the fair.

In recent years, he has been lobbying to become a cast member on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;.

===Music and other media===
On August 31, 2009, Haskins released his first music album called &quot;Karaoke with Your Favorite Principal Dennis.&quot; On the album, he sings everything from &quot;Piano Man&quot; to &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;, the latter being a duet with Hulk Hogan&#x27;s daughter Brooke Hogan. The CD was recorded in the summer of 2009 at Mikron Studios in South Pittsburg, Tennessee, with Mike Headrick. Cody McCarver produced the project, and Mike Yarworth financed it. More recently, in 2010, Haskins appeared in the video for &quot;See You in Shell&quot; by experimental metalcore band Iwrestledabearonce, which parodied &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and films by John Hughes.

Haskins is also a fan of professional wrestling and WWE. He has appeared in multiple episodes of &quot;Z! True Long Island Story&quot;, a YouTube series by WWE professional wrestler Zack Ryder. He is also friends with former Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt.

On July 14, 2016, Haskins performed on stage with the 90s themed band, Saved by the 90s, in Toledo, Ohio, at a Toledo Mud Hens minor league baseball game.

Haskins appears in the music video for Dirty Heads&#x27; &quot;Vacation&quot;. He is seen in an empty high school lip syncing to the entire track.

Haskins also appears in the music video for Khalid&#x27;s &quot;Young Dumb &amp; Broke&quot; where he plays a principal making an end of year announcement over the school&#x27;s intercom.

<doc id="1148456" wikidata="Q598159" url="?curid=1148456" title="Symmetry in biology">
<text>Symmetry in biology refers to the symmetry observed in organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, the face of a human being has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone displays a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting gases, nutrients, and waste products) which are cylindrical and have several planes of symmetry.

Biological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves – while considered symmetrical – rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of patterns in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by reflection or rotation.

While sponges and placozoans represent two groups of animals which do not show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the body plans of most multicellular organisms exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are radial (cylindrical) symmetry, bilateral, biradial and spherical symmetry. While the classification of viruses as an &quot;organism&quot; remains controversial, viruses also contain icosahedral symmetry.

The importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in taxonomic groupings. The Radiata, animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of Georges Cuvier&#x27;s classification of the animal kingdom. Meanwhile, Bilateria is a taxonomic grouping still used today to represent organisms with embryonic bilateral symmetry.

==Radial symmetry==
Organisms with radial symmetry show a repeating pattern around a central axis such that they can be separated into several identical pieces when cut through the central point, much like pieces of a pie. Typically, this involves repeating a body part 4, 5, 6 or 8 times around the axis – referred to as tetramerism, pentamerism, hexamerism and octamerism, respectively. Such organisms exhibit no left or right sides but do have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.

George Cuvier classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon Radiata (&quot;Zoophytes&quot;), which is now generally accepted to be an assemblage of different animal phyla that do not share a single common ancestor (a polyphyletic group). Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth, to the center of the opposite (aboral) end. Animals in the phyla Cnidaria and Echinodermata generally show radial symmetry, although many sea anemones and some corals within the Cnidaria have bilateral symmetry defined by a single structure, the siphonoglyph. Radial symmetry is especially suitable for sessile animals such as the sea anemone, floating animals such as jellyfish, and slow moving organisms such as starfish; whereas bilateral symmetry favours locomotion by generating a streamlined body.

Many flowers are also radially symmetric, or &quot;actinomorphic&quot;. Roughly identical floral structures – petals, sepals, and stamens – occur at regular intervals around the axis of the flower, which is often the female reproductive organ containing the carpel, style and stigma.

===Subtypes of radial symmetry===
Three-fold triradial symmetry was present in Trilobozoa from the Late Ediacaran period.

Four-fold tetramerism appears in some jellyfish, such as &quot;Aurelia marginalis&quot;. This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four gonads, visible through its translucent body. This radial symmetry is ecologically important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to stimuli (mainly food and danger) from all directions.

Flowering plants show five-fold pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits. This is easily seen through the arrangement of five carpels (seed pockets) in an apple when cut transversely. Among animals, only the echinoderms such as sea stars, sea urchins, and sea lilies are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.

 is found in the corals and sea anemones (class Anthozoa), which are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass Hexacorallia have a hexameric body plan; their polyps have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of tentacles that is a multiple of six.

 is found in corals of the subclass Octocorallia. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The octopus, however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.

==Icosahedral symmetry==

Icosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an equilateral triangle, and 12 corners. Within the icosahedron there is 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry. Many viruses, including &quot;canine parvovirus&quot;, show this form of symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral viral shell. Such symmetry has evolved because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral genes), thereby saving space in the viral genome. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in multiples of 60. For example, the T=3 &quot;Tomato bushy stunt virus&quot; has 60x3 protein subunits (180 copies of the same structural protein). Although these viruses are often referred to as &#x27;spherical&#x27;, they do not show true mathematical spherical symmetry.

In the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel described (Haeckel, 1904) a number of species of Radiolaria, some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include &quot;Circoporus octahedrus&quot;, &quot;Circogonia icosahedra&quot;, &quot;Lithocubus geometricus&quot; and &quot;Circorrhegma dodecahedra&quot;. The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names. Tetrahedral symmetry is not present in &quot;Callimitra agnesae&quot;.

==Spherical symmetry==
Spherical symmetry is characterised by the ability to draw an endless, or great but finite, number of symmetry axes through the body. This means that spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism&#x27;s center. True spherical symmetry is not found in animal body plans. Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga &quot;Volvox&quot;.

Bacteria are often referred to as having a &#x27;spherical&#x27; shape. Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells. In reality, this is a severe over-simplification as bacterial cells can be curved, bent, flattened, oblong spheroids and many more shapes. Due to the huge number of bacteria considered to be cocci (coccus if a single cell), it is unlikely that all of these show true spherical symmetry. It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word &#x27;spherical&#x27; to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses – &#x27;spherical&#x27; viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, being usually icosahedral.

==Bilateral symmetry==
Organisms with bilateral symmetry contain a single plane of symmetry, the sagittal plane, which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves – approximate reflectional symmetry.

Animals with bilateral symmetry are classified into a large group called the bilateria, which contains 99% of all animals (comprising over 32 phyla and 1 million described species). All bilaterians have some asymmetrical features; for example, the human heart and liver are positioned asymmetrically despite the body having external bilateral symmetry.

The bilateral symmetry of bilaterians is a complex trait which develops due to the expression of many genes. The bilateria have two axes of polarity. The first is an anterior–posterior (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism. The second is the dorsal–ventral (DV) axis which runs perpendicular to the AP axis. During development the AP axis is always specified before the DV axis, which is known as the &quot;second embryonic axis&quot;.

The AP axis is essential in defining the polarity of bilateria and allowing the development of a front and back to give the organism direction. The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop. This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called cephalization. It is also argued that the development of an AP axis is important in locomotion – bilateral symmetry gives the body an intrinsic direction and allows streamlining to reduce drag.

In addition to animals, the flowers of some plants also show bilateral symmetry. Such plants are referred to as zygomorphic and include the orchid (&quot;Orchidaceae&quot;) and pea (&quot;Fabaceae&quot;) families, and most of the figwort family (&quot;Scrophulariaceae&quot;). The leaves of plants also commonly show approximate bilateral symmetry.

==Biradial symmetry==
Biradial symmetry is found in organisms which show morphological features (internal or external) of both bilateral and radial symmetry. Unlike radially symmetrical organisms which can be divided equally along many planes, biradial organisms can only be cut equally along two planes. This could represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from a radially symmetric ancestor.

The animal group with the most obvious biradial symmetry is the ctenophores. In ctenophores the two planes of symmetry are (1) the plane of the tentacles and (2) the plane of the pharynx. In addition to this group, evidence for biradial symmetry has even been found in the &#x27;perfectly radial&#x27; freshwater polyp &quot; Hydra&quot; (a cnidarian). Biradial symmetry, especially when considering both internal and external features, is more common than originally accounted for.

==Evolution of symmetry==
Like all the traits of organisms, symmetry (or indeed asymmetry) evolves due to an advantage to the organism – a process of natural selection. This involves changes in the frequency of symmetry-related genes throughout time.

===Evolution of symmetry in plants===
Early flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the expression of &quot;CYCLOIDEA&quot; genes. Evidence for the role of the &quot;CYCLOIDEA&quot; gene family comes from mutations in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The &quot;CYCLOIDEA&quot; genes encode transcription factors, proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry. For example, in &quot;Antirrhinum majus&quot;, &quot;CYCLOIDEA&quot; is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower meristem and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape. It is believed that the evolution of specialized pollinators may play a part in the transition of radially symmetrical flowers to bilaterally symmetrical flowers.

===Evolution of symmetry in animals===

Symmetry is often selected for in the evolution of animals. This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness – either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. Additionally, female barn swallows, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.

While symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial ancestor. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.

Interpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary lineages. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.

==Asymmetry==
Although asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important adaptation. Many members of the phylum Porifera (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.



===Symmetry breaking===
The presence of these asymmetrical features requires a process of symmetry breaking during development, both in plants and animals. Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.

For example, left–right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the embryos of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures (monocilia) that all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.

Much of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called &quot;NODAL&quot; and &quot;LEFTY2&quot; that activate &quot;PITX2&quot; to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express &quot;PITX2&quot; and consequently develops right side structures. A more complete pathway is shown in the image at the side of the page.

For more information about symmetry breaking in animals please refer to the left–right asymmetry page.

Plants also show asymmetry. For example the direction of helical growth in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry – both &quot;LEFTY1&quot; and &quot;LEFTY2&quot; play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.

<text>Ronald Toshiyuki Takaki (April 12, 1939 – May 26, 2009) was an American academic, historian, ethnographer and author. Born in pre-statehood Hawaii, Takaki studied at the College of Wooster and completed his doctorate in American history at the University of California, Berkeley.

His work addresses stereotypes of Asian Americans, such as the model minority concept. Among his most notable books are &quot;Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian-Americans&quot; from 1989 and &quot;A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America&quot; from 1993. Takaki was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1966 to 1971 and University of California, Berkeley from 1971 to 2003.

==Early life==
Born in 1939 in Hawaii Territory, Takaki grew up in the Palolo neighborhood of Honolulu. He was the descendant of Japanese immigrants who worked on the sugarcane plantations. His father, Harry Toshio Takaki, immigrated to Hawaii from Mifune, Kumamoto, Japan as a teenager and worked at a plantation in Puʻunene before studying under Ray Jerome Baker and opening his own photography studio. Harry died when Ronald was five, and Ronald&#x27;s mother married Koon Keu Young, an immigrant from Guangdong, China who became Ronald&#x27;s stepfather. As a young boy, Takaki cared more for surfing than academics, earning the nickname &quot;10-toes Takaki.&quot; During high school a Japanese American teacher, Rev. Shunji Nishi Ph.D encouraged him to pursue college and wrote him a letter of recommendation for the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.

His undergraduate experiences there caused him to begin asking the kinds of questions which evolved into the foundation of his career. As one of only two Asian Americans on campus, he gained a new awareness of his ethnic identity. He was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1961.

Takaki then began graduate studies in American history at the University of California, Berkeley and completed his master&#x27;s degree in 1962 and Ph.D. in 1967. His dissertation was on the subject of American slavery, focusing on the rationale for slavery. This work later became his first book: A Pro-Slavery Crusade: the Agitation to Reopen the African Slave Trade.

Takaki&#x27;s personal experiences inspired him to devote his life to working for equality for Asian Americans and others. A seminal event in his life developed when his wife&#x27;s family refused to accept him because they could only see him as a &quot;jap&quot;—not as a native-born American citizen just like any one else.

==Academic career==
His initial teaching experience was in 1966 at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he taught the first Black History course offered at that institution. When recalling his first day teaching this course, he stated, &quot;When I walked into the classroom I discovered it was held in a huge auditorium - 500 seats and every seat was taken, and students were sitting in the aisles, and there was a loud chitter-chatter, the students were excited...As I made my way to the front of the auditorium all of a sudden a silence descended in this room and their eyes were riveted on me and I could just feel them saying to themselves, &#x27;Funny, he doesn&#x27;t look black&#x27;.&quot; One of his students on the first day asked what the class was going to learn about &quot;revolutionary tactics,&quot; and he later recalled that his immediate response was to suggest that he hoped students would learn skills of critical thinking and effective writing—and that these could be quite revolutionary.

In 1971, he accepted a teaching position at Berkeley where his general survey course, &quot;Racial Inequality in America: a Comparative Perspective,&quot; led the development of an undergraduate ethnic studies major and an ethnic studies Ph.D. program. For the next three decades, he continued to be an important contributor in the growth of the program. He was involved in developing the school&#x27;s multicultural requirement for graduation: the American Cultures Requirement. The long-time Professor of Asian American Studies retired in 2003.

In a course on Asian American Studies, one of his students was Lela Lee, creator of the cartoon &quot;Angry Little Asian Girl&quot;.

==Personal life==

Takaki married Carol Rankin in 1961; they met as students at the College of Wooster. They had three children.
Takaki died of suicide on May 26, 2009, in Berkeley, California, after having multiple sclerosis for nearly 20 years, according to his son Troy.

<text>The Taieri Gorge is located on the Taieri River, in the South Island of New Zealand.
It is a deep canyon carved by the Taieri River on the middle stage of its journey from Central Otago to the Pacific Ocean, between the high plateau of the Maniototo and the coastal Taieri Plains. The gorge is over long and stretches from near Pukerangi to southeast of Outram. A walking track leads from Outram into the southern end of the gorge.

For the upper of the gorge, upstream from the Wingatui Viaduct, the Taieri Gorge Railway runs alongside (and considerably above) the river.

<text>Mark Harvey (born 11 June 1965) is a former Australian rules football player and coach. He played over 200 games during fourteen seasons with the Essendon Football Club, winning three premierships, and was senior coach of Fremantle from 2007 to 2011. In August 2013, he took over as interim senior coach of the Brisbane Lions following the resignation of Michael Voss as senior coach. From 2015 until 2020, Harvey served as an assistant coach at the Essendon Football Club.

==Playing career==
===Essendon===
Harvey played for Essendon Football Club for a total of 14 seasons from 1984 until 1997, playing a total of 206 games where he kicked a total of 171 goals.

Harvey was originally known as a skilful forward, playing that role in the 1984 and 1985 premiership sides, including kicking four goals in the 1985 premiership win. However, injuries in his later career (particularly to his ankles) meant he was used more as a defender, which reduced the stress on his body. In his role as a defender he often played as centre half-back against much taller opponents, making up for his lack of height with his aggressive attack on the football.

Harvey finished in the top five of the Essendon best-and-fairest on four occasions, winning the award in 1992. He was named in the All-Australian team in 1985 and 1993; he also played in premiership sides both those years as well as in 1984. He was also the side&#x27;s leading goalkicker for the 1985 season, an unusual feat for a medium-sized forward in a premiership winning team. In 2002 he was named as the 18th greatest player to play for the club in the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list.

After Harvey announced his retirement from his playing career at the end of the 1997 season, Harvey was given an emotional farewell by his team-mates after a narrow Round 22, 1997 victory over Adelaide Crows at Princes Park.

In 2001 Harvey admitted that he suffered from bulimia for 3 to 4 years of his playing career, after he gained weight following a broken leg.

In 2025 Harvey was named at Number 12 in Don The Stat&#x27;s Top 100 Essendon Players Since 1980.

==Coaching career==

===Essendon Football Club assistant coach (1998-2005)===
Harvey retired as player at the end of the 1997 season, after realising injuries had taken their toll on his body and he could no longer contribute to the side in the way he would like. He remained at Essendon as an assistant coach under senior coach Kevin Sheedy. In the years since was often suggested as a possible senior coach. At the end of the 2004 season, Harvey was a front-runner for a number of coaching jobs, but either wasn&#x27;t offered or chose not to take each of them, and continued to be an assistant at Essendon. However, after the end of the 2005 season, Harvey resigned as Essendon assistant coach. 

===Fremantle Football Club assistant coach (2006-2007)===
Harvey then to took up a job at Fremantle as an assistant coach under senior coach Chris Connolly. He helped Fremantle have their most successful season to date in the 2006 season, reaching the preliminary final.

===Fremantle Football Club senior coach (2007-2011)===
Following a poor start to the 2007 season, Chris Connolly resigned as senior coach after Round 15, when Dockers lost to the Kangaroos by four points, with the Dockers sitting at thirteenth position on the ladder with six wins and nine losses. Harvey was then appointed the caretaker senior coach of Fremantle Football Club for the remainder of the 2007 season. Harvey made his debut as the senior coach for the first time against Adelaide at AAMI Stadium on 21 July 2007. Fremantle performed very well, scoring their highest ever score in South Australia and winning by 25 points. Harvey led Fremantle to win four of the seven remaining games in the 2007 season, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make the finals, finishing in eleventh place.

On 17 September 2007, it was announced that Harvey would be re-appointed as the senior coach of Fremantle on a contract for the next three seasons.

The 2008 season did not start well for Harvey with Fremantle only winning twice in the first thirteen rounds, including a demoralising loss to the previously winless Melbourne despite leading by 50 points at half time in round seven. At the end of the 2008 season, Fremantle under Harvey finished fourteenth on the ladder with six wins and sixteen losses. The following year at the end of the 2009 season Fremantle under Harvey finished fourteenth on the ladder yet again with six wins and sixteen losses.

In the 2010 season, Harvey returned Fremantle to the finals after a three-year absence. Fremantle won its first three matches of a season for the first time ever; which culminated in an upset seven-point victory over the previous season&#x27;s premiers, . But late in the season, Harvey rested up to half of his regular side ahead of a match against in Launceston and the result was a 116-point defeat, just one point off their record margin loss of 117 points suffered against just a season earlier. But against the same opponents a fortnight later, the Dockers won its first finals match under Harvey, and its first since 2006, with a win by 5 goals. Fremantle&#x27;s 2010 season under Harvey ended in a disappointing defeat to at the MCG a week later.

In the 2011 season, Fremantle under Harvey finished eleventh on the ladder with nine wins and thirteen losses, missing out of the finals. Despite being praised for his efforts in attempting to field a fit Fremantle side late in the season when the club was suffering one of the worst injury tolls in the AFL, Harvey was unexpectedly sacked as Fremantle Football Club senior coach on 15 September 2011 at the end of the 2011 season. He was replaced by former senior coach Ross Lyon who on the same night of Harvey&#x27;s dismissal had resigned from his post as Saints senior coach.

===Brisbane Lions assistant coach (2012-2013)===
In November 2011, Harvey signed on as a senior assistant coach to the Brisbane Lions under Michael Voss for the 2012 season and the 2013 season.

===Brisbane Lions caretaker senior coach (2013)===
On 13 August 2013, Harvey was appointed caretaker senior coach of Brisbane Lions for the remainder of the 2013 season, replacing Michael Voss who had been told his contract would not be renewed. Voss then opted not to coach out his contract which expired at the end of the 2013 season. Harvey led Brisbane Lions to win two of the remaining three games left in the 2013 season, to finish Brisbane Lions in twelve position on the ladder. Harvey was however not retained as the Brisbane Lions senior coach at the end of the 2013 season. On 3 October 2013, Harvey quit the Brisbane Lions after Justin Leppitsch was appointed as the Brisbane Lions senior coach for the 2014 season. Harvey then returned to Perth.

===Essendon Football Club assistant coach (2015-2020)===
On 22 October 2014, Harvey announced that he would return to as an assistant coach. At the end of the 2020 season, Harvey stepped down from his role as assistant coach of the Essendon Football Club.

==Post coaching-career==

At the end of the 2020 season, Harvey transitioned out of coaching, but remained at the Essendon Football Club and moved into a role that works across both sides of the football department and administration. Harvey is heavily involved in pro scouting and opposition analysis in the football department, while also working with the commercial department to engage and connect with key coterie and corporate stakeholders.

<doc id="1148475" wikidata="Q540002" url="?curid=1148475" title="Tom Walkinshaw">
<text>Thomas Dobbie Thomson Walkinshaw (14 August 1946 – 12 December 2010) was a British racing car driver from Scotland and the founder of the racing team Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR). He was also involved in professional rugby union, as owner of Gloucester Rugby, and chairman of the team owners organisation for the Aviva Premiership.

==Racing career==
Walkinshaw was born at Mauldslie Farm, near Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland. He began racing in 1968, starting in an MG Midget, before moving on to a Lotus Formula Ford car. The following year he won the Scottish FF1600 title at the wheel of a Hawke. 
In 1970, he entered the British Formula Three championship with Lotus. He later moved to the March &#x27;works&#x27; team, where he broke his ankle in a racing accident. Continuing his career despite this setback, he drove in many classes, including Formula 5000 and Formula Two.

Ford hired Walkinshaw to drive a Capri on the British Touring Car Championship circuit in 1974. This resulted in him winning his class that year. In 1976 Walkinshaw established Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR), continuing to drive for his own team. He competed in the 1976 World Championship for Makes, sharing a Hermetite-sponsored BMW 3.5 CSL with John Fitzpatrick. The pair achieved several good results including a dramatic victory, by just 1.3 seconds, in the Silverstone 6 Hours. In 1984 he won the European Touring Car Championship in a 5.3-litre, V12 Jaguar XJS.

In September 1984, Walkinshaw had teamed up with Australian driver John Goss to drive an Australian Group C spec XJS in the Bathurst 1000. After qualifying in 10th spot, Walkinshaw never left the starting line after transmission failure and was hit from behind by a Chevrolet Camaro. Several cars also joined the crash causing the race to be red flagged and restarted 30 minutes later (the first restart in the race&#x27;s history).

In 1985, Jaguar retired the XJS from Group A racing and TWR was forced to use the cars they&#x27;d been racing in the British Touring Car Championship, the 3.5-litre V8 Rover Vitesse in the European Touring Car Championship. Walkinshaw and Percy won 6 of the 14 races in the championship but could only finish the championship 3rd behind the Eggenberger Volvo 240T&#x27;s of Gianfranco Brancatelli and Thomas Lindström.

With Australia&#x27;s move to Group A in 1985, Walkinshaw vowed to return to Bathurst with his ETCC Jaguars in a bid to win the Australian classic. The three ETCC Jags were brought out of retirement and shipped to Bathurst with the help of &quot;Jaguar Rover Australia&quot; (JRA) and proceeded to dominate practice and qualifying, with Walkinshaw claiming pole position, Jeff Allam claiming second spot on the grid and provisional pole sitter John Goss starting 6th. Driving with regular ETCC co-driver Win Percy, Walkinshaw finished 3rd in the race after leading for over ⅔ distance following a split oil line late in the race. The Allam/Ron Dickson car was out after 3 laps with engine failure when broken glass from the cars right headlight got sucked into the intake system, while the Goss/Armin Hahne car would win for TWR after having to battle for over 100 laps of the 6.172 km (3.835 mi) long Mount Panorama Circuit with a broken drivers seat which had to be held in place by cable ties attached to the roll cage.

The Rovers, with sponsorship from Bastos/Texaco, were again the TWR cars for the renamed ETCC (which had become the FIATCC in 1986 in anticipation of the 1987 World Touring Car Championship). Walkinshaw was again a favourite to take out the title, but once again would finish 3rd. Co-driver Win Percy was originally announced as the 1986 champion before results from earlier races were amended following protest hearings. Walkinshaw had intended to return to Bathurst in 1986 with the V12 Jaguars but withdrew when JRA refused to help with funds following a downturn in the Australian car market.

With sponsorship from the NZ based Strathmore Group, Walkinshaw took the Jaguars to Japan and New Zealand for the 1986 Fuji InterTEC 500 and the XJS&#x27; final race, the 1987 Wellington 500. After some engine work which lifted the V12&#x27;s power output to , Walkinshaw proved that the 1984 spec Jags were still competitive in 1986 by qualifying on pole at the fast Fuji circuit in front of the new Nissan Skyline RS DR30s and Holden VK Commodore SS Group As. Walkinshaw comfortably led the race for the first 6 laps from teammate Jeff Allam and Australian Peter Brock in his Holden Dealer Team VK Commodore before retiring with no oil pressure.

After entering into a partnership with Australian car manufacturer Holden in February 1987 (at the expense of Brock&#x27;s HDT Special Vehicles operation), Walkinshaw fully intended to compete in the inaugural World Touring Car Championship driving a 4.9-litre V8 Holden VL Commodore SS Group A, but withdrew before the first race at Monza in protest at the US$60,000 entrance fee imposed by Bernie Ecclestone who had put in charge of the WTCC by the FIA. Walkinshaw and Jeff Allam appeared with the car at the Nürburgring round of the championship but the car was uncompetitive against the new Ford Sierra RS Cosworths and BMW M3s, retiring with brake problems.

In 1988 TWR developed the Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV and Walkinshaw again teamed with Jeff Allam at the RAC Tourist Trophy at Silverstone. Although still not a match for the Ford Sierra RS500s, Walkinshaw qualified the Commodore in 9th place. The pair finished the race in 15th place following various problems with the car.

Tom Walkinshaw&#x27;s last race as a driver was the 1988 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst. In partnership with Australian Larry Perkins, TWR shipped the ETCC Commodore to Australia for the race as part of the Holden Special Vehicles team. Following a messy lead up to the race, which included Walkinshaw illegally protesting the five leading Australian built Sierras, Walkinshaw and Allam qualified in 13th place (slower than the Perkins Engineering built team car), and was the second retirement after just 5 laps with rear suspension failure. Walkinshaw himself was cross-entered in the Perkins/Denny Hulme car and drove the car later in the race. The car was retired with engine failure after 137 laps while in 2nd place. Walkinshaw&#x27;s protest against the Sierras was later found to be illegal because Perkins Engineering was the entrant for the HSV team and not TWR. The stewards of the meeting had erred in letting Walkinshaw lodge the protest under TWR&#x27;s FIA licence as only a race entrant was entitled to lodge protests under the rules of the meeting. In an ironic twist to Walkinshaw&#x27;s last race meeting as a driver, the three HSV team cars, including the team&#x27;s spare car, were found to have illegal modifications to the steering racks after a counter-protest by Dick Johnson Racing team manager Neal Lowe, though no action was taken as the spare car didn&#x27;t start the race and both race cars failed to finish.

Following the Tooheys 1000, Walkinshaw retired from driving to concentrate on the management of TWR&#x27;s increasing motorsports portfolio.

==Team management==

In 1975 Walkinshaw established Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR), a group whose business was the manufacture and design of racing and road cars. TWR ran touring car programmes in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. In 1983 the TWR team took eleven wins in eleven races in the British Saloon Car Championship running Rover Vitesses, before being stripped of the title for a technical infringement. TWR also ran a Jaguar XJ-S ETCC touring car programme before taking on their World Sportscar Championship programme. In six years the programme won Le Mans twice (1988 and 1990) and the World Championships three times (1987, 1988 and 1991). The same team brought engineer Ross Brawn to prominence.

In 1991 Walkinshaw was recruited as engineering director of the Benetton F1 team which subsequently won the 1995 Formula One World Championship. He was involved in the recruitment of Michael Schumacher by Benetton after the German&#x27;s Formula One debut with the Jordan team. As engineering director, his role also came under scrutiny when the team was investigated for suspected technical infringements during the 1994 season, including the potential use of banned electronic aids and unauthorised modifications to the refuelling apparatus used on the cars. Although illegal software was found in the Benettons, the FIA had no evidence that it had ever been used in a race and no action was taken against the team.

For 1995 Walkinshaw bought 50% of the Ligier team from Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore. His intention was to take over the team completely, but he was unable to purchase 100% of the team and therefore pulled out of the deal. Instead he bought the Arrows team, achieving a coup for the 1997 Formula One season by recruiting reigning world champion Damon Hill to his squad.

In 1997 Walkinshaw was voted Autocar Man of the Year. By this stage the TWR Group employed 1500 employees in the UK, Sweden, Australia and the United States. At the time, Walkinshaw was also managing director of Arrows Grand Prix International.

His TWR racing group went into liquidation in 2002 after the Arrows team ran out of money. This led to the Australian arm of the operation being bought by Holden. However, since the practice of teams being owned by manufacturers in the Supercars Championship was banned, Holden had to divest the team&#x27;s assets and sell the Holden Racing Team to lead driver Mark Skaife, and K-Mart Racing (later HSV Dealer Team) to John and Margaret Kelly (the parents of V8 Supercar drivers Todd and Rick).

In 2005 Tom Walkinshaw returned to the V8 Supercars Australia and began a new relationship with his former teams, helping lead Holden to its first series win since 2002 through driver Rick Kelly (2006) and Garth Tander (2007). In late 2006 Walkinshaw Performance bought the small Australian sports car manufacturer Elfin Cars. In 2007 Walkinshaw Performance acquired a 50% stake in the Holden Racing Team, and in 2008 fully re-acquired the team from Skaife. 2009 saw the debut of Walkinshaw Racing a two car operation known individually as Bundaberg Red Racing and Team Autobarn.

==Personal life==
Walkinshaw died on Sunday 12 December 2010, aged 64, from complications arising from cancer. He is survived by his son Fergus Walkinshaw from his first marriage, and his second wife Martine Walkinshaw and their sons Ryan and Sean. Walkinshaw&#x27;s memorial service was held at Gloucester Cathedral on 4 February 2011.

Fergus Walkinshaw, who has been racing since 11 years old, inclusive of Ginetta Juniors and GTSupercup, has followed in his fathers footsteps and has restarted TWR in October 2023.

Ryan and Sean followed their father into motorsport, Ryan in management as one of the team principals of the racing team that wears the family name, Walkinshaw Andretti United, the descendant of the Australian arm of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. The team is co-owned by Andretti Autosport and United Autosports and races in the Australian Supercars Championship. Sean as a racing driver who competes regularly in GT racing, most often in GT3 spec series like GT World Challenge Europe.

<text>Ernest Martin Hennings (February 5, 1886 – May 19, 1956) was an American artist and member of the Taos Society of Artists.

==Biography==
E. Martin Hennings was born in Penns Grove, New Jersey on February 5, 1886 to German immigrant parents. Two years after he was born, Hennings&#x27; father moved his family to Chicago.

Looking back on his early exposure to art and his decision to pursue a life as an artist, Hennings remarked; &quot;It was rather strange that I chose painting for my profession, for practically none of my family showed any artistic tendencies. It happened that when I was 12 or 13 years old, another lad and myself wandered into the Art Institute of Chicago and it was during that visit that I determined to become an artist. That day I secured a pamphlet that showed me that art could be studied. That had never occurred to me.&quot;

It was in 1901 that Hennings began taking classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, which was largely based on the great European art schools and made particularly emphasis on the importance of drawing. On June 17, 1904, he graduated from the school with honors, but continued to study there for another two years, mostly under the instruction of John Vanderpoel.

Hennings eventually took up work as a commercial artist, mostly painting murals and portraits around Chicago. Murals on which Hennings worked, usually on canvas panels, include one for the cafeteria at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Florentine Ballroom at the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago, and &quot;The Ascension&quot;, a mural painted for the Grace Episcopal Cathedral in Topeka, Kansas.

==Europe==
Out of a desire to return to fine art painting, he re-enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and soon entered, in 1912, a painting in a competition at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, for which he won second prize. He soon enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in Germany, under the direction of Angelo Junk, Walter Thor, and Franz von Stuck, who was particularly influential on the painter. In January 1914, Hennings became a member of the American Artists Club in Munich, Germany with Victor Higgins and Walter Ufer, who would both later become fellow Taos Society of Artists.

Before World War I escalated, Hennings relocated back to his hometown of Chicago and initially resided at the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Ave, where Louis Grell joined him for a short period before the two moved studios to the famous Tree Studio artist colony in Chicago&#x27;s North side. At this time Hennings also joined the artist run Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art, and by 1916 had already gained respect in Chicago with a number of awards, including a Gold Medal from the Palette and Chisel Club as well as the Englewood Women&#x27;s Club prize at the Art Institute of Chicago.

==New Mexico==
Hennings soon attracted the attention of a number of Chicago businessmen and art patrons, including Carter H. Harrison, Jr. Harrison offered to sponsor a trip for Hennings to visit and paint in Taos, New Mexico, in exchange for the works he completed during his stay. Hennings was not the first to receive such a proposition; Walter Ufer and Victor Higgins had both been approached by Harrison three years earlier, and soon settled permanently in the Southwest.

Hennings accepted the patron&#x27;s proposition and spent the summer and fall of 1917 in and around Taos. Harrison supplied Hennings with an introduction to the newly created New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico. For the inaugural exhibition at the museum Hennings exhibited three paintings. In that year, 1917, Hennings exhibited his first painting in the United States, outside of Chicago, at the National Academy of Design in New York City.

Although Hennings soon traveled back to Chicago to continue his work as a commercial artist, three years later he moved permanently to Taos. His new home allowed Hennings to expand past the limitations of commercial art, to paint freely. In particular, the artist was able to travel around the area surrounding Taos freely, painting en plein air subjects of intense natural beauty in remarkable light, none of which would have been possible in Chicago. In part due to his academic education, Hennings&#x27; primary interest was in portrait painting, with his primary subject being the Native Americans living in and around Taos Pueblo.

While continuing to paint predominantly in the Southwest, Hennings frequently exhibited in Chicago. In 1922 he was awarded the Clyde M. Carr Prize from the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the Institute&#x27;s Fine Arts Building Prize. The following year his success in his hometown continued with the Martin B. Cahn Prize, again from the Art Institute of Chicago, for his painting &quot;The Twins&quot;.

==Taos Society of Artists==
Such accolades contributed to Hennings&#x27; reputation and, also in 1923, the painter was nominated by Oscar E. Berninghaus and Walter Ufer for membership in the Taos Society of Artists. However, he was not elected a member that year, but was re-nominated the following year and, this time, received a unanimous vote. Catharine Carter Critcher was accepted for membership at the same meeting.

During one trip back to Illinois, in 1924, Hennings met Helen Otte, an employee at the Chicago department store Marshall Field&#x27;s. The two were married just two years later, on July 20, 1926, and travelled extensively through Europe for 16 months for their honeymoon, visiting Italy, France, Spain, and Morocco.

In the years before he was married, Hennings completed his first prints, eight lithographs of various Southwestern subjects. The prints were made on zinc plates and printed in Chicago. Six of the lithographs; &quot;Across the Sage&quot;, &quot;The Frozen Stream&quot;, &quot;Through Sage and Cedar&quot;, &quot;Indian Bake Ovens&quot;, &quot;Beneath the Cottonwoods&quot;, and &quot;The Hunters&quot;, were first printed in an edition of 50, and later in a second edition of 100. The prints &quot;Taos Indian&quot; and &quot;Indian Maiden&quot; were produced in a more limited number. Hennings only completed one other print project, which consisted of four monotypes.

Feeling that the organization had run its course and achieved its purpose, the Taos Society of Artists disbanded in 1927. It had grown to include some of the nation&#x27;s most accomplished painters, including Joseph Henry Sharp, Ernest Blumenschein, Bert G. Phillips, Oscar E. Berninghaus, E. Irving Couse, W. Herbert Dunton, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, and Kenneth Miller Adams.

==Mature career==

By the 1920s, the now established painter was building his reputation on the national scene, with exhibitions and awards including; the Walter Lippincott Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1925), the lsidor Medal and the Ranger Fund Purchase prizes at the National Academy of Design in New York (1926), the Harry Frank Prize from the Art Institute of Chicago (1927), exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1928 and 1933), and won first prize at the 1929 Texas Wildflower Competition. Hennings&#x27;s success was not limited to the United States, however, and he was included in the 1924 Venice Biennale, the International Exhibition in Paris in 1926, and the 1927 Paris Salon.

Many art collectors throughout America sought out his paintings. Such private patrons included Carter H. Harrison, Jr., Oscar F. Mayer, Robert McKee, and Lutcher Stark. Hennings also received support from the Public Works of Art Project and the Section of Painting and Sculpture, which commissioned the mural &quot;The Chosen Site&quot; in a Van Buren, Arkansas, post office. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad also broadly supported his work, including commissioning specific works for advertisements, and remained a supporter of Hennings throughout his career.

==Death and legacy==
E. Martin Hennings died May 19, 1956. Hennings was buried in his hometown of Chicago, rather than his adopted town of Taos, New Mexico.

Today paintings by Hennings are housed in the following museums; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Stark Museum of Art, Booth Western Art Museum, C.M. Russell Museum, Denver Art Museum, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Gilcrease Museum, New Mexico Museum of Art, National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, Rockwell Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, National Museum of Wildlife Art, and Woolaroc Museum.

The E. Martin Hennings House and Studio Historic District in Taos is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>James Blanco Martin (born July 21, 1961) is an American guitarist who played with the rock band Faith No More from 1983 to late 1993.

==Career==
In the early 1980s, Martin played guitar in the thrash metal band Vicious Hatred.

===Faith No More===
Martin joined Faith No More in 1983, four years after the group&#x27;s formation. He played on the albums &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;, their breakthrough record &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, with new vocalist Mike Patton replacing Chuck Mosley, and &quot;Angel Dust&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, Martin left the group for reasons that remain unknown. On his now-defunct website, Martin stated that &quot;The Real Thing&quot; was FNM&#x27;s ideal album, both in the creative process and the subsequent touring. The musical about-face that the band took with &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, including the change in focus from guitars to vocals, did not sit well with him. The extent to which Martin did or did not contribute to songwriting and recording on &quot;Angel Dust&quot; is a subject that the band for years never directly addressed, except to recognize his major influence on the track &quot;Jizzlobber&quot;.

In an October 2016 &quot;PopMatters&quot; interview, Faith No More bassist, Billy Gould, addressed the controversy head-on about whether studio musicians or Martin played on &quot;Angel Dust&quot;:

&quot;No studio musicians. He played, but the writing process was extremely difficult because he wasn&#x27;t really much of a fan of the music. He wasn&#x27;t really behind it. He wasn&#x27;t really into it. So it was a tough process. I mean, I think, really, we realized that he wasn&#x27;t going to continue while we were making that record because he was just on a different musical page.&quot;

Martin said in an interview, &quot;My publicized &#x27;not being into&#x27; &quot;Angel Dust&quot; was all about the way the whole process went down. There was a lot of weird pressure to follow up &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, and as a consequence, the album &quot;Angel Dust&quot; was more contrived musically than I thought was necessary.&quot;

FNM fired Martin by fax on November 30, 1993, after the band had not progressed as they would have liked in rehearsals and songwriting. As an indication of the gulf that had formed between Martin and the rest of the group, they had recorded and released &quot;Another Body Murdered&quot; (with Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., for the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack) without his participation. Similarly, Martin produced and recorded material for the film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; without the participation of other members of FNM. Producer Matt Wallace later mentioned in &quot;The Real Story&quot; (a biographical book about Faith No More) that the death of Martin&#x27;s father was a factor in the guitarist&#x27;s departure.

On February 18, 2009, &quot;Blabbermouth&quot; announced that Martin would not be participating in the rumored Faith No More reunion tour. On February 23, Mike Patton confirmed that the band would be reuniting for a string of European tour dates. Two days later, Gould identified the lineup for the tour, which excluded Martin.

===Other projects===
Martin&#x27;s only solo album to date is entitled &quot;Milk and Blood&quot; (1997), on which he covers his former band&#x27;s song &quot;Surprise! You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, from &quot;The Real Thing&quot;.

Martin toured as lead guitarist with punk band Fang between 1998 and 2000.

In 2011, Martin joined Metallica onstage with Gary Rossington, Pepper Keenan, and Jerry Cantrell to play &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot; as part of the band&#x27;s thirtieth-anniversary shows. In 2013, he played guitar for the Infectious Grooves reunion at Orion Music + More festival at Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan.

===Film appearance===
In 1991, Martin appeared in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; as &quot;Sir James Martin, head of the Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center&quot; in the future. Martin&#x27;s only lines in the film were &quot;Station!&quot; and &quot;What a shithead&quot;.

<doc id="1148486" wikidata="Q1061970" url="?curid=1148486" title="Change management (ITSM)">
<text>Change management is an IT service management discipline. The objective of change management in this context is to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to control IT infrastructure, in order to minimize the number and impact of any related incidents upon service. Changes in the IT infrastructure may arise reactively in response to problems or externally imposed requirements, e.g. legislative changes, or proactively from seeking improved efficiency and effectiveness or to enable or reflect business initiatives, or from programs, projects or service improvement initiatives. 

Change management can ensure standardized methods, processes and procedures which are used for all changes, facilitate efficient and prompt handling of all changes, and maintain the proper balance between the need for change and the potential detrimental impact of changes. Change management within ITSM (as opposed to software engineering or project management) is often associated with ITIL, but the origins of change as an IT management process predate ITIL considerably, at least according to the IBM publication &quot;A Management System for the Information Business&quot;. For example, the IBM &quot;Yellow Book&quot; conception of change control (as a subset of resource control) was strictly concerned with the transfer of deliverables from projects into production. Similarly, Schiesser in &quot;IT Systems Management&quot; defines Change Management as &quot;a process to control and coordinate all changes to an IT production environment.&quot;

<doc id="1148492" wikidata="Q152517" url="?curid=1148492" title="Hyundai Rotem">
<text>Hyundai Rotem Company, often referred to as Hyundai Rotem (), is a South Korean manufacturer of railway rolling stock, railway signalling, defense products and plant equipment. It is a member of Hyundai Motor Group and has presence in more than 50 countries worldwide. As of 2023, Hyundai Rotem has more than 3,900 employees. 

== History ==
On 1 July 1999, Korea Rolling Stock Corporation (KOROS) was founded as a result of the merger between three major rolling stock divisions of Hanjin Heavy Industries, Daewoo Heavy Industries, and Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries. In August 2001, Daewoo Heavy Industries agreed to sell its stake in KOROS to Hyundai Mobis, which let the latter become the majority shareholder of the company. KOROS subsequently changed its name to Rotem Company, where &quot;Rotem&quot; is known to be short for &quot;Railroad Technology System&quot;, on 1 January 2002. It adopted its current name on 3 December 2007 to reflect its current parent company. Its shares are listed in the Korea Exchange in October 2013.

While Hyundai Rotem officially designated its founding date as 1 July 1977, which was the time when the rolling stock division of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries was established, in certain of its publications, it tried to trace its roots to other pre-1999 merger entities which started building rolling stock in 1964.

==Railway products==
===Rolling stock===
Notable projects include supplying majority of South Korea&#x27;s rolling stock, which include Korail&#x27;s KTX high speed trains, electric multiple units (EMUs), and electric locomotives. Other products in South Korea include supplying majority of Seoul Metro, Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit, Busan Metro Lines, and Shinbundang Line&#x27;s rolling stock.

International products include Hong Kong MTR&#x27;s K-Stock and R-Stock EMUs, commuter EMUs for Taiwan, trains for the New Delhi Metro, and automated trains for the Canada Line in Vancouver, Canada. It delivered 120 Silverliner V commuter trains for SEPTA Regional Rail in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area and 66 Silverliner Vs for Regional Transportation District (RTD)&#x27;s A Line. As of early 2025, the largest order ever for Hyundai Rotem&#x27;s rail solution division is a KRW2.2027 trillion (approximately USD1.5 billion) contract to supply double-deck electric trains to the Moroccan National Railways Office in the same year. It is the largest single order not only for the company but also for any South Korean rolling stock manufacturing company.

Besides conventional trains powered by diesel, overhead wire and third rail, Hyundai Rotem is also developing hydrogen mobility technology based on the hydrogen fuel cell technology system of its holding company, Hyundai Motor Company. In 2021, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell tram design was unveiled, which was later recognised in the product category of iF Design Award 2023. Detailed specifications were announced in 2024, with trams having such design and specifications to be firstly introduced to Daejeon Metro Line 2 in South Korea, which is scheduled to commence operations in 2028.

== Selected railway projects ==

=== Hyderabad Metro ===
Hyderabad Metro Rail announced on September 12, 2012, that it has awarded the rolling stock tender to Hyundai Rotem of South Korea. The tender is for 57 rakes consisting of 171 cars which will delivered phase wise at least 9 months before the commencement of each stage. On 22 May 2014 the first train had arrived at Uppal depot in Hyderabad. On 31 December 2014, Hyderabad Metro created a new technology record by successfully running a train in Automatic Train Operation (ATO) mode for the first time on Indian soil between Nagole and Mettuguda.

=== Istanbul Marmaray ===
Hyundai Rotem announced on November 11, 2008, that it had signed a €580m contract to supply the rolling stock for the Marmaray cross-Bosporus tunnel project in Istanbul. The Korean firm saw off competition from short-listed bidders Alstom, CAF and a consortium of Bombardier, Siemens and Nurol for the 440-vehicle contract which was placed by the Ministry of Transport&#x27;s General Directorate of Railways, Harbours &amp; Airports.

The 22 m long stainless steel cars will be formed into 10 and five-car EMUs. Some production will be carried out locally by Eurotem, Hyundai Rotem&#x27;s joint venture with Turkish rolling stock manufacturer TÜVASAŞ. The cars will arrive in three batches, the first 160 cars by 2011, the last by June 2014.

Hyundai Rotem won its first contract in Turkey in 1996, and has now completed seven orders for a total of 804 vehicles worth US$1·6bn. In July it signed a contract to provide 84 DMUs in conjunction with Tüvasas.

&#x27;Hyundai Rotem has earned the trust of Turkey by providing high quality products and technology&#x27;, said Executive Vice-chairman Yeo-Sung Lee. &#x27;We believe this brightens the outlook for future business opportunities in Turkey such as the Istanbul line and the Ankara line.&#x27;

=== Boston MBTA ===
Hyundai Rotem was awarded a contract with Boston&#x27;s MBTA in early 2008 for the construction of 75 cars. The contract entails the delivery of the first 4 cars by October 2010 while the remaining 71 cars were scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2012. However, due to chronic delays, shoddy workmanship, material shortage, and the death of Hyundai Rotem&#x27;s chief executive, M.H. Lee, in November 2012, only four cars have been delivered by the end of 2012. On December 21, 2012, the MBTA sent a letter to Hyundai Rotem threatening to cancel the contract if a solution is not soon reached, which, would be a breach of the contract terms. Since then, the new cars have continued to experience various mechanical problems resulting in car shortages and delays.

<text>Norðragøta (), also just referred to as Gøta, is a village on Eysturoy island, Faroe Islands.

== Overview ==

The municipality of Gøta (&quot;Gøtu kommuna&quot;) was a municipality until 1 January 2009 when it merged with Leirvík into Eysturkommuna. Gøta consists also of the villages Gøtueiði, Gøtugjógv and Syðrugøta. The village lies on Eysturoy&#x27;s east coast at the bottom of the inlet Gøtuvík. There is a museum called &quot;Gøtu Fornminnisavn&quot; with the famous house &quot;Blásastova&quot;. The wooden church in the centre of the village is from 1833.

Gøta is a place of great importance in the history of the Faroe Islands. One of the key figures in the Icelandic saga, Færeyinga saga, called Tróndur í Gøtu (Old Norse: Þrǫ́ndr í Gǫtu) lived here. Tróndur was a heathen Viking-chief who ruled all of the islands for a period of time. In the narrative, Tróndur is depicted as the antagonist, juxtaposed against the protagonist, Sigmundur Brestisson. Sigmundur played a pivotal role in the Christianization of the Faroe Islands on behalf of the King of Norway.

==Sports==
The most popular pastime in Norðragøta is football. The local football team is Víkingur Gøta, formerly known as Gøtu Ítróttarfelag. They play their home games at the Serpugerði Stadium.

==Music==
Gøta is home to G! Festival, one of the largest music festivals in the Faroe Islands.

<doc id="1148506" wikidata="Q342989" url="?curid=1148506" title="John Toshack">
<text>John Benjamin Toshack (born 22 March 1949) is a Welsh former professional football player and manager.

He began his playing career as a teenager with his hometown club Cardiff City, becoming the youngest player to make an appearance for the side when he made his debut in 1965. After establishing himself in the first-team, he went on to make over 200 appearances and scored 100 goals in all competitions after forming a striking partnership with Brian Clark.

In 1970, he joined First Division side Liverpool, where he formed a noted forward partnership with Kevin Keegan and Steve Heighway that helped the club to win two league titles, the European Cup, the UEFA Cup on two occasions, the FA Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. His partnership with Keegan was so effective that the two were described as telepathic. Mounting injuries eventually led to him securing his release from Liverpool to join Swansea City as player-manager in March 1978. He led the club to three promotions in four seasons, elevating them from the Fourth Division to the First Division in a feat that led former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly to describe him as the &quot;manager of the century&quot;. During his career, he scored over 150 goals in the Football League in more than 350 appearances and also represented Wales at international level, winning 40 caps and scoring 13 goals.

He resigned from Swansea in 1984 after suffering relegation and embarked on a managerial career abroad, taking charge of Sporting CP in Portugal and later Spanish side Real Sociedad, winning the Copa del Rey in 1987. Two years later, he was appointed manager of Real Madrid and led them to a fifth consecutive La Liga title with a record total of points and goals scored. However, a disappointing start to the following season resulted in his dismissal in November 1990 and he returned to Real Sociedad. In 1994, he was appointed part-time manager of Wales alongside his job at Sociedad but resigned from the role after just 47 days having been in charge for one match, citing the strong support for former manager Terry Yorath among fans and a &quot;political war&quot; as reasons. In 1995, he was appointed manager of Deportivo La Coruña during the club&#x27;s &quot;Super Depor&quot; era, reaching the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semifinals in his first season before departing acrimoniously in February 1997.

After a spell in Turkey with Beşiktaş, he returned to Real Madrid for a second time but was sacked ten months later after refusing to retract criticism he had made of his players in a press conference following a defeat. In 2004, he was appointed as manager of Wales for a second time and remained with the side for six years, presiding over three ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaigns. He later managed Macedonia and Azerbaijani side Khazar Lankaran before managing outside Europe for the first time in his career with Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca and Tractor of Iran.

==Early life==
John Toshack was born on 22 March 1949 in Cardiff, Wales, and grew up on Northumberland Street in the Canton area of the city. His father George was from Dunfermline in Scotland and worked as a carpenter. He moved to Wales while serving in the RAF, being stationed at MOD St Athan, and met Toshack&#x27;s mother Joan, whom he later married.

As a child, Toshack attended Radnor Road Primary School, where he first played football for ten minutes in a school trial match, and later Canton High School for Boys. As a teenager, Toshack also played rugby and cricket and was regarded as a promising outside-half before a fractured shoulder suffered playing rugby led to him focusing on football. He left the school at the age of sixteen with O-levels in French and history.

==Playing career==

===Cardiff City===
While at school, Toshack was selected to represent Cardiff Boys, where he played alongside Terry Yorath. In 1963, Toshack scored in every match he played for the side and broke the team&#x27;s scoring record with his 33rd goal in eleven matches as Cardiff defeated Swansea 2–0 in the Welsh schools divisional final. He was later selected to represent the Wales under-15 side.

In 1965, he joined his hometown club Cardiff City, signing for them as a 16-year-old on a contract worth £12 a week with an £8 appearance bonus and a £4 win bonus. In his early days at the club, he was in charge of cleaning the boots of John Charles. He became the youngest ever player to play in a senior match for the club when he came on as a substitute in place of Graham Coldrick to make a goalscoring debut during a 3–1 win over Leyton Orient on 13 November 1965 at the age of 16 years and 236 days, a record which stood for 41 years until it was broken by Aaron Ramsey in 2007. His performance during his debut persuaded manager Jimmy Scoular to promote him to the starting line-up for the following match and Toshack found the net again, scoring a brace during a 4–3 victory over Middlesbrough. In his first season in professional football, he scored six goals during nine appearances in all competitions.

Establishing himself in the side over the next few years, Toshack rejected a £70,000 move to Fulham when he was 18 as he felt he was too inexperienced to play in the First Division and would learn more by playing under Cardiff manager Scoular. He scored his first career hat-trick in January 1968 in an 8–0 win over Ebbw Vale in the Welsh Cup, and went on to form one of the most prolific partnerships in the club&#x27;s history alongside Brian Clark. In the 1968–69 season, he scored 31 goals in all competitions, including three goals in a two-legged Welsh Cup final against Swansea City, finishing as the club&#x27;s top scorer and the highest goalscorer in the Second Division. He scored two further hat-tricks for Cardiff, in 1969 against Queens Park Rangers and in 1970 against Hull City.

In November 1970, several days after scoring his 100th goal in all competitions for Cardiff during a 2–1 victory over French side Nantes in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Toshack completed a transfer to Liverpool. The club had made several previous offers for Toshack that had been rejected however, the Cardiff City board stated that they had left the decision up to the player who chose to move clubs. Cardiff manager Scoular and board member George Edwards both opposed the transfer, but were unable to convince chairman Fred Dewey to block the move.

===Liverpool===
The deal was completed on 11 November 1970, Liverpool manager Bill Shankly paying £111,000 for the striker, a club record fee at the time. £100,000 went to Cardiff for the sale of the player while the Football League received £5,500 for the transfer and Toshack himself received the remaining £5,500. Liverpool had resurrected a potential deal for Toshack after an attempt to sign Huddersfield Town forward Frank Worthington collapsed after he failed a medical. He made his debut three days later on 14 November 1970 in a goalless league draw with Coventry City at Anfield. His first goal came a week later on 21 November in a Merseyside derby at Anfield. With the game 0–0 at half-time, Everton scored two early goals just after the start of the second half before Steve Heighway scored from an acute angle for Liverpool. In the 76th minute, Toshack headed a goal from a Heighway cross that turned the game around; then Chris Lawler volleyed home, after Toshack had headed on an Alec Lindsay cross, for the 84th-minute winner.
In his first season at Anfield, Toshack scored seven times in all competitions but his noted aerial ability proved to be a key asset in Liverpool&#x27;s style of play as it helped the side reach the 1971 FA Cup Final, losing 2–1 to Arsenal. The following year, Kevin Keegan joined Liverpool from Scunthorpe United and the pair struck up a successful partnership, which was often referred to as being telepathic, with Toshack winning balls in the air and Keegan finishing the knock downs.

After defeat in the 1971 FA Cup final and missing out on the league title by a single point in 1972, Toshack won his first major honour with Liverpool in 1973 despite missing 20 league matches due to injury. Don Revie&#x27;s Leeds United visited Anfield on Easter Monday for a match involving two of the three 1972–73 Football League title challengers. Two minutes after the break Peter Cormack put Liverpool ahead before Keegan added a late second to seal the win. With Arsenal only drawing in their match against Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0–0 draw against Leicester City to claim their first major trophy since 1966. Toshack also helped the side to win the 1972–73 UEFA Cup against German team Borussia Mönchengladbach. The 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a torrential downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day. The 27 minutes that had been played had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia Mönchengladbach&#x27;s defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this, he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. Keegan profited with two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3–0 win. Liverpool lost 2–0 away in the second leg but won the tie 3–2 on aggregate.

Toshack also played in the 1974 FA Cup Final when Liverpool defeated Newcastle United 3–0, having scored winning goals in the quarter and semi-final matches against Bristol City and Leicester City. However, he found himself out of the first-team at the start of the following season after the club signed Ray Kennedy from Arsenal. Frustrated with the situation, Toshack looked to move and the club accepted a £160,000 bid from Leicester City in November 1974. Although he stated of his desire to remain with Liverpool, he was reluctant to be only playing reserve matches. However, the deal later collapsed after he failed a medical and, at the age of 25, Toshack was told by specialist doctors that he only had around twelve months left to play due to mounting injuries. He was able to force his way back into the first-team soon after, but his training time was restricted in an effort to prolong his playing career.

He won a further league and UEFA Cup double in 1976 and enjoyed his most prolific season with Liverpool, scoring 23 goals in all competitions. He ended his medal haul with a further league title in 1977 but increasing injury concerns limited his appearances and a proposed £60,000 transfer to Belgian side Anderlecht broke down after a medical discovered calcification in some muscle tissue. Toshack eventually negotiated his release from his contract at Liverpool in order to move into management. During his time with Liverpool, Toshack scored 96 goals in 247 appearances in all competitions. He was voted in at No.34 on the Liverpool website poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;, in which thousands of fans worldwide voted for their top 100 Liverpool players.

==International career==
Toshack played for Wales at schoolboy and under-23 level before making his senior debut on 26 March 1969 in a 1–1 draw with West Germany. He scored his first senior goal in his following match, a 2–1 defeat to East Germany a month later. He was part of the Welsh side that topped their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 1976, scoring three times during qualifying, before losing a two-legged play-off match against Yugoslavia.

He went on to earn 40 caps and scored 13 goals, including a hat trick against Scotland in the 1979 British Home Championship.

==Managerial career==
===Swansea City===
Having secured his release from his contract at Liverpool, Toshack looked to move into management and approached his former club Cardiff City over a coaching position but was rejected by manager Jimmy Andrews who questioned his qualifications for the role. Toshack instead received a phone call from Swansea City chairman Malcolm Struel and was invited to a meeting at the club. Following this, he was appointed player-manager of Fourth Division club Swansea on 1 March 1978, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 29. Succeeding Harry Griffiths who stepped down to become his assistant, Toshack&#x27;s appointment was seen as a significant coup for Swansea and the crowd for his first match in charge, a 3–3 draw with Watford, more than doubled from the club&#x27;s previous home match with over 15,000 in attendance.

He overhauled numerous aspects of the club&#x27;s day-to-day routine including changing players&#x27; diets, moderating their alcohol intake and revising travel arrangements for away matches. He was an immediate success at the Vetch Field, winning promotion from the Fourth Division in his first season in charge after finishing third. However, the club&#x27;s celebrations were muted following the death of Griffiths from a heart attack prior to a match against Scunthorpe United in April 1978. Toshack praised Griffiths for his role in helping the club win promotion, stating: &quot;Most of the hard work had been done [...], chiefly by Harry. Gaining promotion would be a memorial to him&quot;.

The following season, Toshack convinced several of his former Liverpool teammates, such as Ian Callaghan, Phil Boersma and Tommy Smith, to join the club. Smith and Callaghan had both received offers to stay with Liverpool, although with limited playing time, but approached Toshack over a move and would train at Liverpool&#x27;s Melwood training ground before travelling to Swansea for matchdays. Toshack led the club to a second consecutive promotion in 1979, sealing their place in the Second Division with a 2–1 win over Chesterfield on the final day of the season with Toshack himself scoring the winning goal that confirmed promotion after bringing himself on as a substitute.

After finishing mid-table in their first season in the Second Division, Swansea claimed a third promotion in four seasons in 1981 after beating Preston North End 3–1 on 2 May 1981 and won the Welsh Cup for the first time in fifteen years soon after by defeating Hereford United. After achieving promotion, Toshack&#x27;s former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly heaped praise on his achievements, stating &quot;he&#x27;s done a remarkable job, I would say he&#x27;s possibly manager of the century.&quot; Once they reached the top flight, Swansea were predicted by many to be relegated, but in their first match in the First Division they claimed a 5–1 victory over Leeds United after a hat-trick from newly arrived club-record signing Bob Latchford. In recognition of his achievements at the club, Toshack was awarded an MBE midway through the season. Swansea topped the league at several stages of the season, leading the division with only three months remaining, but injuries to key-players Latchford and another former Liverpool teammate of Toshack&#x27;s Ray Kennedy, saw a downturn in results and they won just one of their final six matches before finishing their first campaign in the top flight in sixth position. During this period, he was told by the Liverpool board that he was their choice to replace current manager Bob Paisley when he chose to retire. Toshack had openly coveted the position, stating: &quot;When I went to Swansea the thing I wanted in the long term was to end up at Liverpool&quot;. However, Paisley remained longer than expected and the position eventually went to Joe Fagan. Swansea were relegated the following year as the club suffered financial difficulties after relatively big spending under Toshack&#x27;s tenure and then suffered a second successive relegation. He resigned in October 1983 but returned eight weeks later, remaining with the club for a further three months before departing again in March 1984. The heavy spending during Toshack&#x27;s years at Swansea were often cited as a key factor in the severe financial issues that affected the club, being issued with a winding up order due to unpaid debts in December 1985.

===European management===

In 1984, Toshack was appointed manager of the Portuguese side Sporting CP, but he only lasted one season in the post, during which he led the team to second place in the league. He instead moved to Spain, taking a position as manager of Real Sociedad where he led the side to victory in the 1986–87 Copa del Rey and were the league runners-up in 1988.

Although their following season was disappointing, finishing the La Liga season in eleventh position, Toshack was appointed manager of Real Madrid in 1989. Madrid were reigning La Liga champions having won their fourth consecutive title the previous year and their squad was described by club president Ramón Mendoza as the &quot;best Real Madrid side for the past 25 years&quot;. Nevertheless, Toshack strengthened defensively by adding Oscar Ruggeri and Fernando Hierro to the club&#x27;s ranks, but endured a difficult start after losing to rivals Barcelona and being eliminated from the European Cup in the second round; he was also under pressure from local press, despite leading the La Liga table after ten matches. However, the side soon discovered their form and they eventually claimed the league title after scoring a record 107 league goals during the season, becoming only the second team to score 100 or more goals during a single season at the time. A disappointing start to the following season and a three-match losing streak led to him being sacked by the club after eleven matches in November 1990 and he returned to Sociedad, initially in an advisory role, before taking charge soon after.

In Spain, Toshack became known as &quot;John Benjamin&quot;–nicknamed &quot;JB&quot;–as there was a common misunderstanding that his middle name was a Spanish-style paternal surname. He was noted for a habit of literally translating English-language idioms into Spanish during his press conferences, to the confusion of Spanish journalists.

===Wales national football team===
In 1994, Toshack was appointed as manager of the Wales national team on a part-time basis, taking the job alongside his position in charge of Sociedad, after approaches for Terry Venables and Bobby Robson were rejected. Although the ten scheduled competitive matches the team were due to play coincided with a break in Spanish league fixtures, he stated his intention that Sociedad would remain his first priority if any other international matches should clash with domestic ones. He was appointed to succeed Terry Yorath, who had narrowly missed out on qualification to the 1994 FIFA World Cup and had expressed his desire to remain in the role but was not offered a new contract by the Football Association of Wales (FAW). On 9 March 1994, Toshack took charge of his first game for Wales, a 3–1 defeat to Norway at Ninian Park in Cardiff. Toshack had already come under scrutiny over his commitment to the role after arriving in Wales only two nights before the match and taking a single training session with the team beforehand. With support for Yorath still strong among Welsh fans over his dismissal by the FAW, a disappointing performance against Norway saw the team jeered off at both half and full-time and Toshack resigned from the role after just 47 days in charge. He later claimed that there was a political &quot;war&quot; surrounding the team following Yorath&#x27;s acrimonious departure and he decided to &quot;wash his hands&quot; of the situation.

===Besiktas and return to Real Madrid===

After leaving Sociedad, he spent two years in charge of Deportivo de La Coruña, resigning after the board signed two players without his knowledge, before moving to Turkey to join Beşiktaş on the recommendation of Bobby Robson, finishing sixth in his first season in charge. Although Toshack led the club to victory in the Turkish Cup in 1998, he endured a difficult time at the club, as he clashed with the board on several occasions and had threatened to quit in October 1998.

In February 1999, he returned to Real Madrid following the sacking of Guus Hiddink. Madrid agreed to pay £372,671 compensation to Beşiktaş in order to secure the move. With the club in sixth position on his arrival, they eventually finished the season in fifth under Toshack. However, the start of the following season saw Madrid again struggle and, following a 3–2 defeat to Rayo Vallecano that left them in eighth position, Toshack publicly criticised his players, particularly Albano Bizzarri commenting that the goalkeeper conceded goals &quot;that made me weep&quot;. Toshack claimed that his words were meant as a motivational tactic and refused club president Lorenzo Sanz&#x27;s request that he withdraw his comments, saying &quot;there&#x27;s more chance of a pig flying over the Bernabeu&quot;. The Real Madrid board dismissed him soon after. Toshack would later take Madrid to court over his dismissal and was awarded over £700,000 in compensation.

He later spent a short period with French side Saint-Étienne in 2000, leaving the club for third spell in charge of Real Sociedad. Despite pulling Saint-Étienne out of the relegation zone, the club&#x27;s fortunes rapidly declined after his departure, becoming entangled in a forgery scandal which docked the club seven points to confirm its relegation at the end of the 2000–01 season. At Sociedad, Toshack reversed the club&#x27;s declining fortunes and pulled it out of the relegation zone to finish in 13th place in his first season after having rewarded the captaincy to 20–year old Xabi Alonso, who became the club&#x27;s star player under Toshack. After amassing 27 points in 29 games the following season, he was sacked in March 2002.

He then had short spells with Italian team Catania from November 2002 to January 2003, in a calamitous season for the club in which it got relegated from the Serie B in a scandal known as &quot;Caso Catania&quot; before the decision was reversed in August 2003; this preceded another return to Spain with last–placed La Liga side Real Murcia in January 2004, failing to save the club from relegation.

===Wales (second spell)===
In November 2004, Toshack was appointed as manager of the Wales national team for the second time after being named as the &quot;unanimous&quot; choice of the FAW. He was named in a three-man shortlist for the role alongside Frenchman Philippe Troussier and former Welsh international Dean Saunders. Toshack&#x27;s appointment was unpopular with some senior players with Robbie Savage claiming he could face a player mutiny if appointed. In total, seven players announced their international retirement within months of Toshack&#x27;s appointment, including Savage, captain Gary Speed, who had been critical of Toshack&#x27;s opinions previously, Mark Pembridge and Andy Melville. Former Wales manager Mark Hughes also questioned Toshack&#x27;s suitability for the role, stating that UEFA coaching qualifications which Toshack did not possess should be considered a prerequisite for the job.

One of his first acts as manager was to place Brian Flynn in charge of Wales&#x27; various youth levels, replacing Ian Rush and Neville Southall, and the pair set about rebuilding an ageing squad and uncovering players with the eligibility to play for Wales, such as Ashley Williams. His first match in charge was a friendly against Hungary on 9 February 2005 which ended in a 2–0 win for Wales, both goals being scored by Craig Bellamy. His first competitive match in charge came one month later when they suffered a 2–0 defeat to Austria, where Toshack was blamed for making a late substitution with the match at 0–0 that allowed Austria into contention and conceded two late goals. A second defeat to Austria four days later ended Wales&#x27; slim remaining hopes of qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In his first full qualifying campaign, Toshack&#x27;s squad was plagued by withdrawals, so much so that he chose to issue a letter to 36 Welsh players for them to show &quot;total commitment to the cause&quot;. With the noted retirements and regular withdrawals, Toshack was forced to use a relatively youthful side for a difficult qualifying campaign in which Wales finished fifth out of seven teams and failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008. A defeat to Poland in February 2009 caused anger among supporters as captain Craig Bellamy clashed verbally with fans and a further defeat to Finland a month later saw the side jeered off the pitch at full-time. In October 2009, Wales were unable to fill a squad for a friendly match against Finland following four retirements in the months prior to the match. One of the players, Paul Parry, cited being made to feel like a &quot;spare part&quot; as the reason for his decision to make himself unavailable for selection.

Despite mounting pressure to resign, Toshack remained in charge for the start of the next qualifying campaign. However, on 5 September 2010, he offered his resignation from the Wales job following a 1–0 away defeat to Montenegro in their first Euro 2012 qualifying match. He left the job by mutual consent on 9 September 2010, although he had stated his desire to remain in the job for the two following qualifying matches. During his six-year tenure with Wales, a total of 18 players retired from international duty but he also handed debuts to numerous players, including many of the side that would go on to reach the semi-final of UEFA Euro 2016.

===Macedonian national team===

Eleven months after resigning from his role with Wales, Toshack was appointed manager of the Macedonia national football team on 7 August 2011. However, Macedonia won one of his eight matches in charge and his contract with the national side was terminated on 13 August 2012 after he refused the request of Football Federation of Macedonia president Ilčo Gjorgioski to relocate to the country.

===Khazar Lankaran===
On 8 March 2013, it was announced that Toshack would take over as manager of Khazar Lankaran of the Azerbaijan Premier League on 15 March 2013. At the time of his appointment, Khazar Lankaran were eighth in the league and competing in the relegation group for the final 10 games of the season. Toshack&#x27;s first game in charge of Khazar Lankaran was a one all home draw against AZAL. Toshack&#x27;s first win came in his second game in charge, a 1–2 away victory against bottom of the table Kəpəz. Khazar Lankaran ended the season in eighth position, with a league record under Toshack of three games out of nine won, with an equal number of three matches drawn or lost. Toshack also guided Khazar Lankaran to the final of the 2012–13 Azerbaijan Cup with a 2–1 aggregate victory over Baku in the semi-finals, resulting in a game against Premier League champions Neftchi Baku which Khazar lost 5–3 on penalties. As a result of Neftchi Baku winning both the Premier League and Cup, Khazar qualified for the UEFA Europa League. Toshack won his first trophy with Khazar Lankaran on 23 October 2013, defeating Neftchi Baku in the 2013 Azerbaijan Supercup. On 22 November 2013, Toshack resigned as manager of Khazar Lankaran, following 14 points in the first 14 games of the season, leaving Khazar in eighth place in the league.

===Wydad Casablanca===
On 20 June 2014, Toshack was appointed as manager of Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca. He led the club to a league title in his first season in charge and a second-place finish the following year, but on 16 September 2016, after suffering a heavy defeat to Zamalek in the first leg of the 2016 CAF Champions League semi-finals, Toshack and Wydad Casablanca parted ways.

===Tractor===
In June 2018, he was appointed manager of Iranian side Tractor until 2021. He left the club in September 2018.

==Personal life==
On 7 June 1969, Toshack married Susan Bann from Grangetown, Cardiff, at the age of 20 at St John Church in Canton. After 43 years of marriage, the pair divorced in 2012 with his wife citing &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot;. Toshack&#x27;s son Cameron is also a former professional footballer, having made five appearances for Cardiff City, and with Swansea City for the 1989–90 season.

In 1976, while playing for Liverpool, Toshack composed and published a book of poems entitled &quot;Gosh, it&#x27;s Tosh&quot;.

In 1981, Toshack won the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year and received the MBE for his services to football in the 1982 New Year Honours list. He was the subject of an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Roehampton Club in London.

On 27 February 2022, Toshack was reported to be seriously ill in a Spanish hospital, suffering from COVID-19.

<text>Gøtueiði () a town in the Faroe Islands, located deep in the Skalafjordur-inlet on Eysturoy, founded in 1850. 

The village has now grown towards its neighbour-village Skipanes. During the 1980s there were religious tent-meetings in Gøtueiði.

Gotueidi consists of the villages/settlements Norðragøta (Northern Gøta), Syðrugøta (Southern Gøta), Gøtugjógv (Gøta&#x27;s cleft) and Gøtueiði (Gøta&#x27;s isthmus). They form part of the Eystur municipality.

<text>Gøtugjógv (), Norðragøta and Syðrugøta are villages that are located in the Faroe Islands. These areas are located at the end of an inlet which is called &#x27;Gøtuvík&#x27;. This is on the east side of the island of Eysturoy.

A new church has been built near Gøtugjógv, and inside it has huge stained glass windows made by the artist Tróndur Patursson from Kirkjubøur. The church turned out to be two times more expensive than originally planned.

From 1980 until 1989 there was an upper secondary school in Gøtugjógv.

<doc id="1148512" wikidata="Q736870" url="?curid=1148512" title="Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)">
<text>Hooker Glacier is one of several glaciers close to the slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. It is not as large as its neighbour, the Tasman Glacier, measuring 11 kilometres (roughly 6–7 miles) in length.

==Etymology==
The geographic Hooker items were named by the Canterbury provincial geologist, Julius von Haast, after the English botanist William Jackson Hooker.

==Description==

The glacier starts on the south-western slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook, with its tributaries Sheila Glacier, Empress Glacier, and Noeline Glacier.
Hooker Glacier runs south from there until its terminus at Hooker Lake. The glacial water from the lake is the source of the Hooker River, a small tributary of the Tasman River, which flows into Lake Pukaki.
One of New Zealand&#x27;s more accessible glaciers, the glacier and its terminus can be seen clearly from the end of the Hooker Valley Track. This easy walk to the glacier lake is the most popular in the region.

For serious trampers and mountaineers, there are three huts along the glacier further up the valley: Hooker Hut, Gardiner Hut, and Empress Hut.

The current glacier lake only started to form in the 1970s, left behind as Hooker Glacier retreated.
Like many of the glaciers in the Southern Alps, Hooker Glacier is rapidly melting, with the glacier lake projected to grow as the terminus retreats until it reaches the glacier bed about 4 kilometres upstream from the current terminus.

<text>RosettaNet is a non-profit consortium aimed at establishing standard processes for the sharing of business information (B2B). RosettaNet is a consortium of major Computer and Consumer Electronics, Electronic Components, Semiconductor Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Logistics companies working to create and implement industry-wide, open e-business process standards. These standards form a common e-business language, aligning processes between supply chain partners on a global basis.

==Overview==
RosettaNet is a subsidiary of GS1 US, formerly the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC). It was formed mainly through the efforts of Fadi Chehade, its first CEO. RosettaNet&#x27;s 500 members come from companies around the world. The consortium has a presence in USA, Malaysia, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Thailand and Australia. RosettaNet has several local user groups. The European User Group is called EDIFICE.

The RosettaNet Standards website shut down by the end of 2013 and RosettaNet Standards is now managed as part of GS1 US website.

==The RosettaNet standard==
The RosettaNet standard defines both e-commerce document and exchange protocols, as part of the Electronic data interchange (EDI).

The RosettaNet standard is based on XML and defines message guidelines, interfaces for business processes, and implementation frameworks for interactions between companies. Mostly addressed is the supply chain area, but also manufacturing, product and material data and service processes are in scope.

The standard is widely spread in the global semiconductor industry, but also in electronic components, consumer electronics, telecommunication and logistics. RosettaNet originated in the USA and is widely used there, but it is also well accepted and even supported by governments in Asia. Due to the widespread use of EDIFACT in Europe, RosettaNet is used less, but it is growing.

The RosettaNet Automated Enablement standard (RAE) uses the Office Open XML document standard.

The RosettaNet Technical Dictionary (RNTD) is the reference model for the classification and characterization of the products in the supply chains that use RosettaNet for their interactions.

<text>Klaksvík () is the second largest town of the Faroe Islands behind Tórshavn. The town is located on Borðoy, which is one of the northernmost islands (the Norðoyar). It is the administrative centre of Klaksvík municipality.

==History==
The first settlement at Klaksvík dates back to Viking times, but it was not until the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern Faroese town that became a cultural and commercial centre for the Northern Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole.

Klaksvík is located between two inlets lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a modern fishing fleet. Originally, four farms were located where Klaksvík is now. In time, they grew into four villages: Vágur, Myrkjanoyri, Gerðar and Uppsalir; which finally merged to form the town of Klaksvík in 1938. What triggered the development of the town was the establishment of a centralized store for all the northern islands on the location.

The brewery Föroya Bjór in Klaksvík is a Faroese family brewery, founded in 1888. The ram has been the symbol of the brewery since the early beginning. Since August 2007, when Restorffs Bryggjarí went out of business, Föroya Bjór has been the only producer of beer and soft drinks in the Faroe Islands.

With the opening of the Leirvík sub-sea tunnel, the Norðoyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksvík gained a physical link with the mainland of the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports. Several developments are under way to exploit this symbiosis, including a new industrial park located by the tunnel entrance. Klaksvík is home to Summarfestivalurin.
== Notable buildings ==

Christianskirkjan, built in 1963, is the first one in modern times in Scandinavia to be built in Norse style. The roof construction is the same as that found in the Viking halls, and which has survived in Faroese smoke rooms (kitchens) and village churches. This open roof construction has proved to be especially suitable for church buildings, as the acoustics in this church are better than in others of a similar size. The church is dedicated to the memory of the sailors who lost their lives during World War II. Hanging from the ceiling is an old 8-man rowing-boat, from Viðareiði, it was used to transport the priest between villages.

== Transport ==

Klaksvík used to be an isolated town until 2006 when the Norðoyatunnilin opened. A frequent bus service now links the town to Tórshavn, while smaller services operate to Fuglafjørður, Kunoy and Viðareiði. Also it has remained the ferry port for Kalsoy. Since 2014, a city bus (Bussleiðin) connects the outlying parts with the city centre, and taxis offer additional services. The bus services and the ferry to Kalsoy are operated by Strandfaraskip Landsins, the public transport company of the Faroe Islands. There is a helipad which mainly has flights to isolated islands like Fugloy and Svínoy, as well as to Tórshavn.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Klaksvik is twinned with:
* Sisimiut, Greenland
* Kópavogur, Iceland
* Trondheim, Norway
* Norrköping, Sweden
* Tampere, Finland
* Odense, Denmark
* Taiji, Japan since 2018
* Wick, Scotland. For twenty years the town was twinned with Wick. In August 2015, Wick councillors threatened to break these ties on account of a Faroese long standing practice which involves hunting and eating migrating pilot whales. As of January 2016 the decision has been postponed.

==Sports==
These are some of the sporting associations in Klaksvík:

The local football club is KÍ. In August 2023, KÍ became the first Faroese side to play in the group stages of a European competition, after their win against BK Häcken in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League.

The local gymnastics club is Klaksvíkar Fimleikafelag. In handball there are two clubs, one for men and another for women.

The women&#x27;s handball club is Stjørnan. The men&#x27;s handball club is Team Klaksvík.

Klaksvík is home to Mjølnir, the most successful volleyball club in the Faroe Islands. They have 21 championships in the women&#x27;s league, and 12 championships in the men&#x27;s league. In 2023, Mjølnir became the first Faroese volleyball team to complete in a European Cup. They played in the first round of CEV Challenge Cup against the Dutch side VC Limax losing both matches 3-1 and 3-0.

<doc id="1148529" wikidata="Q754666" url="?curid=1148529" title="Tvøroyri">
<text>Tvøroyri is a village on the north side of the Trongisvágsfjørður on the east coast of Suðuroy island in the Faroe Islands. Together with Froðba, Trongisvágur, Líðin and Øravík it forms Tvøroyri Municipality.

The village is considered to have been founded in 1836, when the Royal Danish Monopoly Trade Store was founded on a small tongue of land, called Tvøroyri. In a short span of years, Tvøroyri grew into a large village, mainly after 1856 when the monopoly state of the store was abolished. Around the turn of the 20th century, Tvøroyri was one of the largest towns on the Faroe Islands and had one of the main fishing industries.

==Overview==
The church in Tvøroyri was constructed in Norway as a building set, moved to Tvøroyri and then built here in 1907, ready to use in 1908. The old church was moved to Sandvík.

=== Trongisvágur ===
Trongisvágur is the village furthest to the west of the inlet of Trongisvágsfjørður. Trongisvágur is where most of the new residential houses have been built. Trongisvágur is home to the large Sports Centre, the children&#x27;s institutions and the football stadium &quot;Stórá&quot;. Stórá is the home of TB – Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag, the oldest football team of the Faroe Islands. TB was founded in 1892; the second oldest team was founded in 1904.

=== Froðba ===
The other neighbouring village is called Froðba. It is further east on the north side of the fjord, on the same side as Tvøroyri. Froðba has columnar basalt along the road. The poet Poul F. Joensen had his home in Froðba – there is a monument there to honour him. Froðba and Trongisvágur are older villages than Tvøroyri.

== History ==
When the monopoly was abolished in 1856, private companies were founded on Tvøroyri. One of these grew into the largest in the Faroe Islands. It had 20 branches and 30 ships. Down by the harbour, north of Seglloftið, lies a square covered by flat stones. Fish used to be dried in the sun here. The Royal Trade Monopoly that had a branch here from 1836 to 1856 built the old houses in the area. The village of Tvøroyri was actually founded due to this branch.
Tvøroyri has a large fillet-factory that initiated its production in 1975.

== Transport ==
The ferry Smyril M/F has 2-3 daily departures from Tórshavn, it calls at Krambatangi ferry port, which is located on the opposite side of the inlet. The trip from Tórshavn to Tvøroyri takes 2 hours. The ferry takes 200 cars and 975 persons. There are two bus lines in Suðuroy, line 700 goes to the southern part of the island with Sumba as its end station, 701 goes to the northern part of the island, the end stations are in Sandvík, the northernmost village, and in Fámjin, which is on the west coast.

== Culture ==
Tvøroyri and Vágur take turns in hosting an annual civic-festival called Jóansøka. It can be described as a smaller version of the Ólavsøka held in Tórshavn. Jóansøka runs in late June.
Tvøroyri has a history and maritime museum and an art gallery.

===Sports===
The sports club TB Tvøroyri was founded in 1892 as a football club, the first in the Faroe Islands. The name TB is also used in volleyball. The club was a branch of TB Tvøroyri, but in 2016 it became an independent club with the name TB Flogbóltur. In December 2016 the three football clubs on the island of Suðuroy, TB, FC Suðuroy and Royn, agreed to merge into one club. The new club will get a new name for the 2018 season, for the 2017 season the name was TB/FC Suðuroy/Royn.

There is a rowing club, Froðbiar Sóknar Róðrarfelag, which was founded in 1934. A swimming club is for the whole island, it is called Susvim or Suðuroyar Svimjifelag.

<doc id="1148531" wikidata="Q578732" url="?curid=1148531" title="Kirkjubøur">
<text>Kirkjubøur () is the southernmost village on Streymoy, Faroe Islands. The village is located on the south-west coast of Streymoy and has a view towards the islands of Hestur and Koltur towards the west, and to Sandoy towards the south. It lies south of the new ferry port of Gamlarætt, which opened in 1993.

The village is the Faroes&#x27; most important historical site, with the ruins of the Magnus Cathedral from around 1300, Saint Olav&#x27;s Church (&quot;Olavskirkjan&quot;), from the 12th century and the old farmhouse of Kirkjubøargarður from the 11th century. In 1832, a runestone was found near the Magnus Cathedral in Kirkjubøur. The stone which is referred to as the Kirkjubøur stone dates back to the Viking Age.

The little islet just of the coast, Kirkjubøhólmur, contains an eiderduck colony. To the village belongs the islet of Trøllhøvdi, just 100m off the northern tip of Sandoy 9 km away from Kirkjubøur. It was given as payment to the villagers, as it was their duty to ferry people across to Sandoy in medieval times.

==History==
The village was important in the Middle Ages. At that time it was the episcopal residence for the Diocese of the Faroe Islands and as such the spiritual centre of the society. In those days the village is said to have had around 50 houses. The majority of these houses were washed away by a fierce storm in 1602, which created the islet Kirkjubøhólmurin, which contains ruins from that time. It is speculated that the church located the diocese in Kirkjubø, to counter the heathen Vé in Velbastaður only 5 km to the north west up the coast.
There are three main attractions from this time:
* Magnus Cathedral ruins from about 1300.
* Saint Olav&#x27;s Church, the oldest still used church of the Faroes dating from 12th century.
*Kirkjubøargarður, the oldest still inhabited wooden house of the world from 11th century.

==Notable residents==
*Sverre I of Norway (1151–1202), grew up here.
*Bishop Erlendur (?-1308), who built the Magnus Cathedral and wrote the Sheep letter, the oldest document of the country.
*Súsanna Helena Patursson (1864–1916), first feminist of the Faroes.
*Jóannes Patursson (1866–1946), nationalist leader and writer.
*Sverri Patursson (1871–1960), writer, journalist and environmentalist.
*Erlendur Patursson (1913–1986), writer and nationalist politician.
*Tróndur Patursson (b. 1944), artist and adventurer.

==Kirkjubøur chairs==
The medieval carved pew ends from Saint Olav&#x27;s Church are now to be found in the National Museum of the Faroe Islands. These were featured in three series of Faroese stamps, engraved by Czeslaw Slania. For the full series, see here.

===Controversy===
In 2004, Kulczyk was associated with the Orlen Scandal. The parliamentary investigative commission report stated that Kulczyk could have considerable influence over operations and human resources politics of PKN Orlen, incommensurable to the share he held. Moreover, the report stated that Kulczyk met with the former KGB resident in Poland, Vladimir Alganov.

Regarding the Orlen investigation, the proceedings at the Prosecutors’ Office in Katowice commenced and the parliamentary investigative commission was appointed. Kulczyk was heard as a witness by the prosecutor&#x27;s office four times (the last one in April 2008) and submitted extensive explanation to the parliamentary investigative commission. Due to lack of evidence, the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office discontinued the proceedings.

Kulczyk was also linked to the so-called Kulczyk Park affair. The Poznań city officials were accused of underrating the land value in the city center, where Kulczyk&#x27;s wife carried out the Old Brewery investment.

Kulczyk was divorced with two children from his marriage with Grażyna Kulczyk: Dominika (born 1977) and Sebastian (born 1980). After the divorce, Joanna Przetakiewicz was his long-time partner.

In the years leading up to his death, Kulczyk commissioned the &quot;Lonsdaleite Estate&quot;, a new personal residence in St Moritz, Switzerland. It was completed after his death and sold for over CHF 180 million, making it the most expensive house in Switzerland.

Kulczyk died on 29 July 2015, in Allgemeines Krankenhaus der Stadt Wien in Vienna due to postoperative complications, and was buried in the family vault at the Jeżycki cemetery in Poznań, next to his father, Henryk Kulczyk (1925–2013).

==The richest man in Poland==
In 2012, the Forbes magazine put Kulczyk at the top of the richest businessmen in Poland ranking, with PLN 8.9 billion (2.1 billion euros). The same year, the Wprost magazine also put Kulczyk at the top of its ranking, assessing his wealth at PLN 9,7 billion. In 2013, the American edition of Forbes magazine rated Kulczyk 384th of the wealthiest people in the world, with a $3.5 billion worth fortune, making him the highest ranked Pole among the world&#x27;s billionaires.

Kulczyk was top ranked 13 times at the list of the 100 richest Poles issued by the Wprost magazine. In 2007, he was ranked 12th, due to his divorce from Grażyna Kulczyk.
In 2015, Forbes ranked him 418th richest man in the world ($4 billion).

<doc id="1148534" wikidata="Q619696" url="?curid=1148534" title="Muixeranga">
<text>The Muixeranga () is the collective name given to the performance of ancient street dances and human pyramids or &quot;castells&quot;, originating in the ancient Kingdom of Valencia (currently the Land of Valencia), which are still preserved in the town of Algemesí, southwest from Valencia, and certain other Valencian towns.

The &quot;muixeranga&quot; is much more than an artistic acrobatic dance. It is a collection of ancient human choreographies of enormous plasticity illustrating various figures and shapes, which are held during the Algemesí town festival (September 7 and 8th), in honor of the Virgin of Health (&quot;Mare de Déu de la Salut&quot;).

The &quot;Muixeranga&quot; resembles the modern &quot;castellers&quot; in many ways, the latter being spread all over Catalonia. Both traditions share the same origin, the &quot;Moixiganga&quot;, (a series of dances of human towers) once found throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Muixeranga differs from castellers mainly in that the &quot;Muixeranga&quot; has a religious background and is accompanied by a traditional dance, it is also focused in the height of the human towers, but focuses also in the complexity and technique in order to create a plastic, figurative scene.

==La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival==
The feast day of Our Lady of Health, patroness of Algemesi is September 8, and commemorates the legendary discovery in 1247 of a statue depicting the Madonna and Child. The image venerated in the town since the mid-twentieth century is a replica, because during the Civil War the original image of the Virgin of Health was destroyed, as was the chapel. The festival appears to have originated in a street party in the area of the Chapel of Finding and gradually spread to other neighborhoods. The main celebration in held on 7 and 8 September, is preceded by a novena at the Chapel of the Finding, which begins August 29 and ends on September 6. The festival has preserved traditional dances and music, and has served as a source for the recovery of dances that formally existed in other locations and have been able to be re-established.

The involvement of the town&#x27;s inhabitants is the foundation upon which the continuity of this celebration is based. Each ritual works and has been prepared independently since the 18th Century. From the “Muixeranga” through to each of the dances, the different variations and musical scores have been passed from generation to generation. In the early 18th Century the dances belonged to different guilds; for example, the “Muixeranga” was the domain of construction workers, the “Carxofa” of the weavers, and so on. But social changes brought modifications to this custom and the traditions opened up to include people from other professional sectors. UNESCO has recognized the ritual, festive and community participation dimension of the Valencian celebration Our Lady of Health as part of the &quot;intangible heritage of humanity&quot;.

The Festivity of “la Mare de Déu de la Salut” has been studied by ethno-anthropologists, sociologists and historians. It has inspired artists, musicians and poets. All of these people have remarked on the breadth of the cultural content of this event. Artistic groups such as the “Muixeranga”; dances like “els Bastonets” or “els Tornejants”; or the music that accompanies the performances are all the result of having conserved a fundamental part of the cultural heritage of an entire town.
It was this popularity and interest in the tradition that led to the creation in 2002, of the Museu Valencià de la Festa (a Museum dedicated to the Festivity); which offers exhibitions and research into the Festivity. At the centre, visitors can learn about the history, the ritual acts, the dances, the music and the costumes of the celebration, as well as enjoying many stories from the event.

== Origin and evolution ==

There are several theories on the origin of muixeranga, especially in relation to its name. The first theory advocates that the word comes from the Arabic word &quot;mochain&quot;, meaning &quot;mask&quot;. A second theory links it with ancient processions held on the streets to commemorate some special event.

Even though the tradition in the Iberian Peninsula may date back to the 13th century, the first written record of the &quot;muixeranga&quot; in Algemesí can be traced to the first third of the 18th century. However, its constant, strong presence suggests a much older origin.

The first solemn celebrations of the Virgin of Health happened in 1724, so this is the earliest that the muixeranga could be linked to this celebration. However, the first concrete date comes from the town account book in the year 1733, when the dulzaina players employed in the festival were given an annual stipend.

The guilds were the real driving force behind the event, and in changing times, they died out. The Muixeranga began to wane and by 1973 it had almost disappeared altogether. A group including writer Martí Domínguez i Barberà, Mayor Manuel Rico, Vicent Raga, festival organiser in the Capella neighbourhood, and Father Vicent Castell Maiques, with the support of the students’ association Associació d&#x27;Antics Alumnes dels Maristes, were responsible for re-launching it under the guidance of Tomàs Pla. A year later the Friends of assossiació Muixeranga was founded. Eloi Miralles, a member of the Colla de Castellers de Vilafranca del Penedès, arranged for the muixeranguers to visit the Penedès capital and on August 31, 1978, the Muixeranga rose up in Villafranca&#x27;s main square, banishing forever that lack of visibility which might have proved fatal.


==Processions==

===The Promeses Processó===
At nightfall on 7 September, the beginning of the festivities is signaled by the ringing of the bells of the Basilica of St. James the Apostle. When the ringing stops and silence descends, the first notes of the flutes are sounded and the first of the processions begins. The procession, which begins with the mysteries and martyrdoms, (short theatrical pieces, performed by groups of children), has a scrupulous order with the towers of the Muixeranga second, followed by the Bastonets, the Carxofa, the Arquets, the Pastoretes, Bolero or llauradores, and the city band.

===Morning Processoneta ===
On the morning of September 8, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, there is a second, shorter procession known as the &quot;Morning Processoneta&quot;.

===The Great Volta===
The procession called the Great Volta, starts about 4:00 p.m. and is the longest, lasting over seven hours. Starting from the Basilica of St. James, the traditional dances of Algemesí and the image of the patron pass back through the old city, repeating the original itinerary of 1724.

== Characteristics ==
After the mysteries and martyrdoms, all the processions display a series of dances; the Muixerangas leads the rest. The Muixerangas, a set of tableaux composed of human towers and representative figures, has several stages, and opens with all muixerangueros dancing in two rows with candles burning. The dance is accompanied by the music of drum and flute. The muixerangueros then form a human tower moving to the sound of the music. The tower is topped by a child with open arms.

The forms of the Muixerangas assume plastic or pliable shapes that open or appear to form different figures which have all Marian symbolism. The Valencian town of Algemesi and its Muixeranga, lays claim to being the origin of the &quot;castells&quot; found throughout Catalonia.
 
The people composing the castles are usually a group of men, of virtually any profession, but preferably of strength and physical skill. Nowadays, around 200 men participate in the plastic figures, but historically there were not more than thirty. There is a master, or conductor, which coordinates the dance and the human castles, towers and other figures, as well as admitting and training new people.

The clothes are idiosyncratic in many ways. They are composed of a shirt, trousers, farmer&#x27;s shoes and sometimes a special hat. The fabric is coloured with vertical red and blue stripes on a white base, like a harlequin. It seems that this strange appearance is unintentional. Older people can still remember that they were once made from old mattress fabric.

Accompanying the group, some young members carry some jugs cut in half and painted with stripes with typical colors of the same muixeranga (designed by former member Juan Ezquer in 1973) which serves to collect funds for the activities of Muixeranga.

== Music and symbology ==
The dance is accompanied by the music of tabalet (a drum) and dolçaina (valencian shawm), with a very old characteristic tune, of unknown author.

Some people striving for the recovery of the Valencian culture and its language, such as Joan Fuster, have suggested the music of the Muixeranga as an anthem for the Valencian Community.

<text>Riot police are police who are organized, deployed, trained or equipped to confront crowds, protests or riots.

Riot police may be regular police officers who act in the role of riot police in particular situations, or they may be separate units organized within or in parallel to regular police forces. Riot police are used in a variety of different situations and purposes. They may be employed to control riots as their name suggests, to disperse or control crowds, to maintain public order or discourage criminality, or to protect people or property. The militarization of modern police has brought militaristic riot gear and new technologies that allow for their duties to expand above normal police duties.

==Riot gear==
Riot police often use special equipment called riot gear to help protect themselves and for offensive use in riot control. Riot gear typically includes personal armor, batons, tactical shield, riot shields, and riot helmets. Many riot police teams also deploy specialized non-lethal weapons, such as: baton rounds, sponge grenade, pepper spray, tear gas, riot guns, rubber bullets, stun grenades, water cannons, and Long Range Acoustic Devices.

Through the 1900s and into the 2000s, riot gear technology has advanced with the help of the militarization of riot police organizations. Some riot gear technology, including tear gas, was originally created for its use in the military, specifically the First World War. In the United States in 1969, it was recorded that the riot police had extensive militarized gear including bulletproof vests, multiple-purpose grenades, water cannons, helicopters, batons, radio communication, barbed wire, police shields, and riot vehicles. In 2017, economic and political protests in Venezuela brought upon a new era of Venezuelan riot police gear with military vehicles that included features like tear gas launchers and water cannons. The military vehicles were used as perimeter defense lines to contain the protests, and provide the riot police with enough power to inhibit the advancing violence. These military vehicles used by riot police around the world are commonly sourced from military product companies including Norinco, a Chinese military product manufacturer.

In the United States, the federal 1033 program allows for police departments, including riot police units, to request military equipment for circumstances that have arrived or that may arrive in the future. Because of this program, police militarization has expanded across each state allowing state riot police to receive military style gear similar to that of the Special Weapons and Tactics teams. The police departments that received 1033 program funding are primarily smaller police departments.

Riot gear became the key tools for police forces to combat large demonstrations, including political and economic protests and labor demonstrations, that sought change without the explicit consent of the presiding government.

== Riot police duties ==
Riot police are tasked with police operations that require advanced tactics and equipment to control crowds and maintain public order. These duties may differ between riot police organizations in different countries, but they are often similar in that they are tasked with maintaining order that is decided on by the presiding government.

In Poland, for example, riot police are used in a variety of different ways including but not limited to:

* Maintaining public order when threats from risk assessed sources are present.
* Searching and assisting police forces in capturing wanted fugitives.
* In case of widespread emergency, acting as a mobile force to protect and serve the public.
* Securing government officials, particularly from foreign countries, during their travels.
* Maintaining public order during demonstrations including political protests.
* Supporting police forces in apprehending and suppressing criminal group activities.
* Acting as backup police force for any police units that may need assistance in their everyday duties.
* Participating and overseeing training for riot police units and non-riot police units.

== United States riot police ==
The United States has a long history of riot police being used in public events.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war protests resulted in many instances of large protests across the country. In some cases, these protests would involve clashes between protesters and riot police. The riot police, at this time, did not have as advanced gear and technology, which forced the riot police to have significant face-to-face violent clashes resulting in injuries and deaths of both protesters and police. The 1980s brought in a new era of riot police that intended to use less face-to-face clashes by using more militarized gear and negotiated management. The use of negotiated management sought to improve the riot police&#x27;s ability to communicate verbally among police and protesters in an attempt to lower violence, increase periods of calm, and improve public views of protest policing.

In 1999, the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle disrupted the negotiated management tactics by riot police. The WTO protests went on for days with continuous clashes between protesters and police with tear gas, concussion grenades and riot shields.

In August 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American eighteen-year-old, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Protests began immediately following the reports his death. The Ferguson Police Department enlisted help from the St. Louis County Police Department to contain the ongoing unrest from the crowd of protesters. The St. Louis County Police Department enacted the county&#x27;s Code 1000 plan, enabling the department to receive direct assistance from nearby police departments. Riot police from multiple police departments combined in response. For multiple days, these protests were both peaceful and, in some locations of the protests, disorderly. The riot police utilized riot gear including rifles, riot shields, tear gas, non-lethal weapons, and armored vehicles. After the police officer that shot and killed Michael Brown was identified to the public, the protests reignited with more riot police in helmets, face protectors, gas masks, riot batons, shields, and kevlar vests. The riot place were later supported by the Missouri Governor&#x27;s call for National Guard assistance until the protests continuously diminished.

In 2016, protests by groups of indigenous people, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, protested the building of the 1,200 mile Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Large groups of protesters blockaded the construction zones for the pipeline, which prohibited the ability for the DAPL to further expand. Private security were the first to respond, which escalated the protests and created violent clashes between private security personnel and protesters. Following a federal judge&#x27;s order to allow construction to continue, riot police arrived on the scene. The riot police arrived with armored military vehicles, helmets, face protectors, kevlar vests, shields, and other standard riot gear. Water cannons, pepper spray, and non-lethal weapons were used to disperse protesters and destroy protester encampments on the construction sites.

== French riot police ==

In 2018 and 2019, France experienced massive protests known as the Yellow Vest Protests. The Yellow Vest Protests were primarily in response to rising costs of living, low wages, and vast inequality between higher and lower economic classes. These protests were immediately met with the French riot police. In some areas of Paris, including Place d&#x27;Italie, protesters became violent in response to the police presence. These protesters vandalized private businesses, including banks, and setting fire to police barricades. The riot police responded with standard riot police gear including tear gas, riot batons, and riot shields.

In 2023, French police shot and killed a 17-year-old, leading to national protests that required the use of riot police. President Macron, and the French government, repeatedly called to quell the protests. Some Paris suburbs experienced damaged buildings and burning cars on the streets. Throughout France, upwards of 40,000 police officers were dispatched, many of them fitted in riot gear. French riot police used tear gas, riot batons, and riot shields in an attempt to slow down the protests. Approximately 170 police officers were injured during the protests.

== Quality of life for riot police ==
The riot police occupation has been considered one of the more stressful jobs in law enforcement. Riot police are frequently placed on the front lines of violent protests and riots, possibly putting each individual police officer&#x27;s health and safety at risk. Studies, in recent years, have shown a correlation between higher stress levels among police officers leading to lower quality of life ratings.

In 2018, a Turkish study, researching the quality of life in riot police, found that riot police are significantly affected by negative mental health. The research found that roughly 50% of the riot police examined showed clear signs of both anxiety and depression. Furthermore, levels of anger among riot police were high, which was shown in combination with anxiety and depression to lower the quality of life for these officers. It is hypothesized in the research that the lower quality of life indicators could result in more aggressive action by riot police. The research concluded with an argument for developing programs to minimize negative mental health factors in riot police including the use of regular mental health screenings.

== Criticisms ==
Historically, riot police have been criticized by labor unions and organized strikes. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, labor unions and picketers were subjected to harsh police crackdowns that involved bouts of police brutality to squash the labor movements. Labor historians have argued that riot police became a strong wing of the government in protecting capital. Industrialization brought in more aggressive police response to labor protests to force workers to abandon their efforts. The ramping up of riot police violence in deterring labor organization caused radicalization and politicization among workers and worker organizations throughout much of Canada and the United States.

The recent trend in police militarization across the globe, especially the United States, has brought upon direct criticism from police abolitionist groups. Police abolitionist movements have called for the defunding and replacement of police forces in favor of social programs that support quality of life in people, thus reducing the need for people to commit crimes. Riot police are considered under the police categorization for replacement because of the instances of brutality on protesters in mass protests such as the Ferguson Protests.

In Cyprus, riot police have come under fire recently for hiding their identities when performing police duties such as crowd control. Cypriot law enforcement has been using helmets and gear to cover their faces and badges in order to remain anonymous when dealing with protests and crowds. Citizens of Cyprus believe that riot police hiding their identities allows them to avoid repercussions for actions they may take during their work. On the other hand, 37% of Cypriot riot police believe that &quot;citizens file complaints against the police for no reason&quot;.

Riot police in the United States, France, and many other places, have experienced a rise in protests against the police. These protests have been met by riot police with the controversial use of specific militarized riot gear. In the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in North Dakota, riot police used water cannons during freezing temperatures which caused a potentially lethal and dangerous situation. In the George Floyd protests of 2020, riot police used pepper spray, police projectiles, tear gas, among other riot gear resulting in numerous protester injuries. When police escalate the use of force and arrests are made, studies have shown that the results often create more violence. The use of force, sometimes deadly force, is the point of interest for many protests around the world.

<text>Etnica is a project originally formed by Carlo Paterno, Max Lanfranconi, Maurizio Begotti, and Andrea Rizzo. They are a very well known Goa trance project from Milan, Italy.

==1993-1998==

Max Lanfranconi was a co-producer on an independent Italian label Time Out and had released two singles in the mid-80&#x27;s. Max was also member of the &#x27;Tribe&#x27; group and by 1988 he began organizing &#x27;Dance all Night&#x27; parties in Italy. Dance All Night parties became very famous, the first official parties in Italy to last till the morning lights. Encouraged by the success Max decided to start producing and around in 1992 he met Andrea Rizzo and they started to make music together. Meanwhile, around the same time Maurizio Begotti and Carlo Paterno had started making music elsewhere. In 1993 they all met a record shop and decided to produce music together and Etnica was born. Andrea had a solid classical music background that combined with the melodies of Carlo and Maurizio&#x27;s sense of arrangement would soon lead to the production of some of the most classic goa trance tracks.

Their first EP was published on Brainstorm Records in 1994, and was entitled &quot;The EP&quot;. Their first album, &quot;The Juggeling Alchemists Under The Black Light&quot;, was out in 1995 on the German label High Society. This helped the band to build a solid reputation in the Psychedelic Trance scene. Their second album, the classic &quot;Alien Protein&quot;, was released in 1996 on Blue Room Released.

The band, beside producing music as Etnica, had the idea of creating a party-oriented side project and after some thoughts the name Pleiadians was forged. Starting off with an EP on Symbiosis Records in 1995, they have produced with the original band members two albums, &quot;Identified Flying Object&quot; (1997) and &quot;Family of Light&quot; (1999) in which Carlo was partially involved. Their first album, I.F.O., was started by Carlo during August &#x27;96 and was then finalized with the other band members in September &#x27;96, but released only a year after on Dragonfly Records.

They had another side project, Crop Circles, that was a collaboration with another Italian band, &quot;Lotus Omega&quot; and with that project they released 2 singles, &quot;Full Mental Jackpot&quot; &amp; &quot;Lunar Civilization&quot; both released in 1997 on Auracle Recordings and also finalized an album in 1998, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot; that was finally released only in 2008 on DAT Records.

==1998-present==

In 1998 the band moved its studios to Ibiza where the project would be carried on by Max and Maurizio only. After the writing of their third full-length album &quot;Equator&quot; (1999), Andrea left the band as well.
Since 1999 the band has changed their sound to be up to the modern standards of production, following the worldwide trends and trying to achieve a more mature sound, after successfully proving that they could realize some of the best goa trance tracks ever.

Their fourth album, &quot;Nitrox&quot; (2001) is the result of this evolution and worked really well on the dance-floors at the time of release.
The following album, &quot;Chrome&quot; (2002) displayed a further development in sound production and clarity and was so successful that they released two versions, one for Europe and one for Japan.
Their sixth Etnica album &quot;Sharp&quot; (2004) was liked by old time fans too as it featured a return of melodies, like they did in the past times, but still showed a crystal clear and professional production.
In 2006 a seventh album was released, &quot;Totemism&quot;, featuring all their best hits remixed by the most famous psytrance producers of the millennium. This one was highly acclaimed by fans worldwide.

The Pleiadians project was relaunched in 2006 with the release of a third opus, an album called &quot;7even Sister7&quot;, that delivered many sci-fi oriented tracks, released on Harmonia Records.

Etnica are still very active in the scene and weekly performing DJ and Live sets all around the world.

<doc id="1148551" wikidata="Q587713" url="?curid=1148551" title="The Shamen">
<text>The Shamen ( ) were a Scottish psychedelic band, formed in 1985 in Aberdeen, Scotland, who became a chart-topping electronic dance music act on the UK Singles Chart by the early 1990s. The founding members were Colin Angus, Derek McKenzie and Keith McKenzie. Peter Stephenson joined shortly after to take over on keyboards from Angus. Several other people were later in the band. Angus then teamed up with Will Sinnott, and together they found credibility as pioneers of rock/dance crossover. When rapper Mr. C joined, the band moved on to international commercial success with &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; and their 1992 &quot;Boss Drum&quot; album.

==History==
===1980s===
The Shamen were preceded by Alone Again Or, the Love-inspired name under which they recorded their first psychedelic electronic pop singles. After their name change, further singles picked up airplay from John Peel. Released in June 1987, the Shamen&#x27;s first album, &quot;Drop&quot;, demonstrated their love of 1960s psychedelia, with influences such as Love, Syd Barrett and the 13th Floor Elevators.

By mid-1987, frontman Colin Angus was discovering the sounds of early house-music pioneers, such as S-Express and M/A/R/R/S, and increasing his knowledge of the latest studio equipment. By September 1987, the Shamen were applying these techniques to their own music, mixing rock guitars, techno and hip-hop rhythms and sampled radio voices, which was to prove influential to groups like Jesus Jones and EMF. Their single &quot;Christopher Mayhew Says&quot;, released in late 1987, was their first to experiment with beat machines and samples, fused with their psychedelic rock sound. However, the newfound sound proved too radical for co-founder and vocalist Derek McKenzie, who left the band in late 1987 to study at university. The Shamen were suddenly one crucial player short. Help was at hand from the Glaswegian Will Sinnott (23 December 1960 – 23 May 1991), aka Will Sin, who joined the group in October 1987, on bass and keyboards, freeing up Angus to handle vocals and guitar. Sinnott&#x27;s musical background was an extensive one. He had already made an impression as part of the Can/SAHB influenced improvisation troupe Edith and the Ladies, and his father, a master wood craftsman, had made guitars for the Incredible String Band and John Martyn. At the start of 1988, the first music videos were shot for the Shamen: &quot;Christopher Mayhew Says&quot; and &quot;Knature of a Girl&quot;.

&quot;Knature of a Girl&quot; was the first record by the Shamen to feature Sinnott, but it was not until June&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Loves Amerika&quot; single that the techno influence began to show. By this stage, Angus and Sinnott had become hooked on the acid house movement taking place in London, and its music and clubs were to exert an influence on the pair. Keith McKenzie and Peter Stephenson were less impressed by these new developments, and left the group the following summer, after the January 1989 release of the &quot;In Gorbachev We Trust&quot; album, which saw the group further enhancing their sound. Over summer 1988, they met Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards, who later both worked with the Shamen to help them transition their music into the rave scene.

Angus and Sinnott relocated to London, allowing them to start afresh, and plunge into the emerging rave scene. 1989 was a busy year, as they set out on their Synergy tour, a nightclub experience, combined with live music from the Shamen and others like Orbital, and with DJing from Paul Oakenfold, Mixmaster Morris, Mr C, and Evil Eddie Richards. The tour was to last nearly two years. Synergy was innovative at the time, as a touring rock dance club introducing live bands to clubbers, and house, techno and ambient DJs to rock fans. The Shamen also released the &quot;Phorward&quot; mini album, produced by ex-Fiction Factory singer/songwriter Kevin Patterson.

===1990s===
Their third album, &quot;En-Tact&quot;, was released in 1990, and it spawned the hit singles &quot;Move Any Mountain (Progen &#x27;91)&quot;, &quot;Hyperreal&quot; and &quot;Make It Mine&quot;. Also notable was the appearance of rapper, DJ and producer Mr. C, as well as incorporation of a female vocalist, Plavka Lonich – who was intended to become the focal point of the group. The transformation into a successful rave party act was complete. Tensions had already begun to show, however – the band&#x27;s barely concealed espousal of the then-fashionable new psychedelic drugs and the artistic pressures of altering direction from that of an acceptably skilled guitar band to an electronic dance act. As they continued their Synergy tour, their popularity in the United Kingdom began to rapidly expand. &quot;Hyperreal&quot;, released in March 1991, reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. By this time, they realised they were on their way to reaching mainstream popularity. Every Synergy Live show on the fifth and sixth leg of tours were sold out. On the sixth leg of Synergy in April 1991, Gavin Knight and Richard Sharpe joined as the live drummer and keyboardist for the Shamen respectively.

In May 1991, with the increased popularity of their band, Will Sin decided to release an EP entitled &quot;U Make Me Feel&quot; with an unknown female singer under the pseudonym Elsi Curry, and it was released as a promotional record. Later that same month, after the Sixth Mark of the Synergy Tour, and a one-week tour of Russia, the Shamen headed to Tenerife, to film a video for &quot;Move Any Mountain&quot;. On 23 May, Will Sinnott drowned whilst swimming off the coast of La Gomera. Colin Angus later said: &quot;When it first happened, I was still reeling from the shock of Will&#x27;s completely unexpected and tragic death, and I couldn&#x27;t think about the Shamen at all, couldn&#x27;t see how anything could continue. But as I came to terms with it and thought about the situation I realised that what the Shamen was about was positivity and that positivity is like the spirit of the music and positivity acknowledges the need for change. So for those reasons I elected to carry on and also I knew that the name Shamen really meant a lot to Will and that was one of the main attractions for joining the band for him.&quot;

In July 1991, Plavka Lonich chose to leave the band, because she was planning to start on her solo career. After finding a new female singer, Cheryl Melder, the Shamen embarked on the start of their Progeny tour.
With Mr. C now a full-time member of the Shamen, and Soul Family Sensation&#x27;s Jhelisa Anderson (who was chosen to replace Plavka, as she was already a One Little Indian artist) providing guest vocals, the &quot;Boss Drum&quot; album followed in 1992. &quot;Boss Drum&quot; featured a spoken-word collaboration, &quot;Re:Evolution&quot; with Terence McKenna, and the Shamen&#x27;s biggest and most controversial hit: &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot;. &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot; was accused of promoting drug use, owing to the refrain, &#x27;Ezer Goode, Ezer Goode&#x27; as homophonic with &#x27;E&#x27;s are good&#x27; (E being slang for the drug ecstasy), &#x27;He
s ever so good, he&#x27;s Ebenezer Goode&#x27; (using the homophony of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;E&quot;), and to double entendre drug references throughout the song. This echoed similar references in previous songs such as &quot;Synergy&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;MDMA-zing... we are together in ecstasy&#x27;. Despite – or maybe because of – the subsequent storm of publicity, the song reached the top of the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for four weeks.

Subsequent singles such as &quot;Boss Drum&quot; and &quot;Phorever People&quot; were chart hits, but Terence McKenna observed:
:Nothing ruins you for the underground like success. So when &quot;Boss Drum&quot; went double platinum, they were obviously &#x27;establishment&#x27;... I&#x27;ve talked to Colin about this, and he agrees. It would have been wonderful to hit it big at 23. At 35 it becomes a pain in the ass, and you just have to manage the money and the image.

However, the Shamen&#x27;s new mainstream popularity enabled them to release an unusually large number of remix singles, EPs, and LPs during the &quot;Boss Drum&quot; era, including the &quot;Face EP&quot;, the &quot;S.O.S. EP&quot;, and the &quot;On Air&quot; and &quot;Different Drum&quot; albums. &quot;On Air&quot; featured a series of popular tracks from &quot;En-Tact&quot; and &quot;Boss Drum&quot; as performed live on BBC radio; &quot;Different Drum&quot; was a remix album containing alternate versions of every track from &quot;Boss Drum&quot;. The tracks &quot;Boss Drum&quot;, &quot;LSI (Love Sex Intelligence)&quot;, &quot;Phorever People&quot;, &quot;Ebeneezer Goode&quot;, and &quot;Re:Evolution&quot; were all released as singles in their own right. It was however impossible for the band to fully escape the shadow that Sinnot&#x27;s death had cast across them. At a time and in a scene when performers were often both masked and anonymous, the emerging early 1990s dance music world had lost one of its more notable personalities.

&quot;Axis Mutatis&quot; was released in 1995, with new vocalist Victoria Wilson-James replacing Jhelisa Anderson. Early special editions of this album featured a bonus disk, &quot;Arbor Bona Arbor Mala&quot;, an experimental ambient album.

Always seeking to push out musical and communication boundaries, the Shamen saw themselves as an information band. Their Internet site &quot;Nemeton&quot; was amongst the first British music sites to host unique Web based events, e.g. releasing the first ever single and LP on the net in 1995 and it also features a remarkable piece of software devised by Angus to convert the DNA structures of human life into electronic music. &quot;S2 Translation&quot;, a track on &quot;Axis Mutatis&quot;, was generated using this software.

The Shamen continued recording into the late 1990s, releasing two additional LPs with an increasingly experimental bent. Their penultimate studio album, the instrumental &quot;Hempton Manor&quot;, followed an acrimonious split with their label One Little Indian. It is alleged to have been recorded in seven days to conclude the recording contract with One Little Indian, and the first letter of each track spells out &quot;Fuck Birket&quot;, referring to label founder Derek Birket, who wanted the group to move back into more commercial territory. &quot;UV&quot;, in 1998, was their last album. UV was released independently on Moksha Recordings.

Mr. C has since continued as a house music DJ and became a nightclub owner of The End club. As of 2007, he was also recording as a member of Sycophant Slags, with Francis Harris a.k.a. Adultnapper on Mr. C&#x27;s Superfreq Records label. Colin Angus worked on a project called Pablo Sandoz, from 2004 to 2008.

<doc id="1148554" wikidata="Q1050885" url="?curid=1148554" title="Cathedral Square, Christchurch">
<text>Cathedral Square, locally known simply as the Square, is the geographical centre and heart of Christchurch, New Zealand, where the city&#x27;s Anglican cathedral, ChristChurch Cathedral is located. The square stands at the theoretical crossing of the city&#x27;s two main orthogonal streets, Colombo Street and Worcester Street, though in practice both have been either blocked off or detoured around the square itself. The square was badly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

== Naming ==
The square was originally intended to be called Ridley Square, after the Protestant martyr Nicholas Ridley, but in Edward Jollie&#x27;s 1850 plan of central Christchurch it was marked as Cathedral Square. Ridley&#x27;s co-martyrs and colleague bishops, Cranmer and Latimer have Squares named after them, not far distant from Cathedral Square. The original choice of Ridley is another of Christchurch&#x27;s many references to Oxford, since Ridley was martyred there.

== History ==
In the original survey of central Christchurch (known as the Black Map), which was undertaken in 1850, it was envisaged for Christ&#x27;s College and ChristChurch Cathedral to be built adjacent to one another in Cathedral Square, modelled on Christ Church, Oxford. The area set aside for the college in Cathedral Square was found to be insufficient, and Henry Sewell suggested in June 1853 to move the college to land reserved for the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. This transaction was formalised through &quot;The Cathedral Square Ordinance 1858&quot;, a law passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council in October 1858. The ordinance allowed for Colombo Street to go straight through the middle of Cathedral Square at a legal width of , and the cathedral to be placed west of this thoroughfare.

Christianity has adopted the practice of praying towards the East as the Orient was thought of as containing the mankind&#x27;s original home. Hence, most Christian churches are oriented towards the east, and to comply with this convention, Henry Harper, Christchurch&#x27;s first Bishop, lobbied to have the eastern side of Cathedral Square to be used for the pro-cathedral. That way, the main entrance would face Colombo Street, resulting in praying towards the east in line with convention. &quot;The Cathedral Square Amendment Ordinance 1859&quot;, which was passed a year after the previous ordinance, formalised the change in placement of the cathedral.
Just before work on the cathedral&#x27;s foundations began in 1864, the alignment of Colombo Street through Cathedral Square was changed again by introducing a curve towards the west; the western side of the legal road had a radius of 3 chains 75 links (). The purpose of this change was to allow the placement of the cathedral slightly further west, making its tower visible along Colombo Street from a distance. Up to the point of work starting on the cathedral, here was initially little development.

A statue to John Robert Godley, the city&#x27;s founder, was unveiled on 6 August 1867 on a pedestal opposite the cathedral. It was the first public statue in New Zealand. The city&#x27;s central post office was located alongside the square in 1879.

Over the years Cathedral Square has been redesigned on several occasions. Two significant changes took place when the road in front of the cathedral was closed in 1965, and the road in front of the Post Office closed in 1972. In the late 1990s / early 2000s, the Square underwent a significant reconstruction using new tiling. This was an often criticised project, for example for the amount of glare that the tiles gave off in dry weather conditions, or the tiles being slippery when wet.

In 2001, &quot;The Chalice&quot; was revealed a large modern sculpture in the forum of an inverted cone dedicated to the millennium, the sculpture was designed by Neil Dawson and is made up of forty-two leaf patterns featuring different plants.

Before 2011, the Square was the city&#x27;s main meeting place for people and was a regular site of street performers and speakers, one of the most notable was The Wizard of New Zealand.

Following the earthquakes, Christchurch&#x27;s Anzac Day dawn services were mostly held in Cranmer Square rather than Cathedral Square. This was until 2023 when dawn services returned to Cathedral Square.

New designs for the Square were unveiled in 2017 which would remove the roadways through the square and add green space and waterways and split it into five zones (Post office place, The courtyard, Library plaza, Cathedral gardens and The living room). But the plan lacks funding and the original plans have been shelved.

Te Pae Christchurch Convention Centre opened in 2021 as one of the city&#x27;s anchor projects and the third new building in the Square since the earthquakes after Tūranga and the Spark building.

In 2022 plans to renovate &quot;tatty&quot; corners of the square started these plans were meant to begin in 2019 but had been delayed. Minor work on these plans begun in late 2022 but in July 2023 work started on the completion of these plans in front of the Spark building, Distinction hotel and Old Government building.

Although always called a &quot;square&quot;, its shape is that of a cruciform.

==Registered heritage places==
Cathedral Square has a large number of buildings and statues that are registered as heritage items with Heritage New Zealand. Many of those were damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and because of earthquake damage some have been lost as a consequence.

;Category I places
* ChristChurch Cathedral is arguably the most important heritage building. Its register number is 46 and it was registered on 7 April 1983.
* The Press Building was registered on 2 April 1984, with its register number 302. It was significantly damaged in the February 2011 earthquake and was demolished in July 2011.

* Warner&#x27;s Hotel was registered on 24 April 1997, with its register number 7384. The historic part of the hotel was demolished.

== Transport function ==

When steam trams began operating in the city in 1880, they left from the Square. Later, when buses replaced trams in 1954, the Square was used as the main point of departure. For many years, the square was a busy road intersection. In 1962, the road in front of the cathedral was closed. In 1972 it was redeveloped to provide large pedestrian areas, and the south-west quadrant was closed to traffic.

Trams returned in 1995, with the introduction of a tourist tram ride around the central city. Most buses left the Square when the Bus Exchange in Lichfield Street opened in November 2000. Since then, the public transport use of the Square was by the airport bus, taxis and shuttles. In February 2011 due to the earthquake the Square was closed off but was reopened on 30 June 2013, however some areas and buildings remained fenced off due to earthquake damage.

<text>In molecular biology, endonucleases are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bond within a polynucleotide chain (namely DNA or RNA). Some, such as deoxyribonuclease I, cut DNA relatively nonspecifically (with regard to sequence), while many, typically called &quot;restriction endonucleases&quot; or &quot;restriction enzymes&quot;, cleave only at very specific nucleotide sequences. Endonucleases differ from exonucleases, which cleave the ends of recognition sequences instead of the middle (&quot;endo&quot;) portion. Some enzymes known as &quot;exo-endonucleases&quot;, however, are not limited to either nuclease function, displaying qualities that are both endo- and exo-like. Evidence suggests that endonuclease activity experiences a lag compared to exonuclease activity.

Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from eubacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme is called the &quot;restriction site&quot;. Typically, a restriction site will be a palindromic sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed &quot;sticky ends&quot;. Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined regardless of the origin of the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. &quot;Restriction endonucleases&quot; (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology. One of the more famous endonucleases is Cas9.

== Categories ==

Ultimately, there are three categories of restriction endonucleases that relatively contribute to the cleavage of specific sequences. The types I and III are large multisubunit complexes that include both the endonucleases and methylase activities. Type I can cleave at random sites of about 1000 base pairs or more from the recognition sequence and it requires ATP as source of energy. Type II behaves slightly differently and was first isolated by Hamilton Smith in 1970. They are simpler versions of the endonucleases and require no ATP in their degradation processes. Some examples of type II restriction endonucleases include &quot;Bam&quot;HI, &quot;Eco&quot;RI, &quot;Eco&quot;RV, &quot;Hin&quot;dIII, and &quot;Hae&quot;III. Type III, however, cleaves the DNA at about 25 base pairs from the recognition sequence and also requires ATP in the process.

==Notations==

The commonly used notation for restriction endonucleases is of the form &quot;&quot;Vwx&quot;yZ&quot;, where &quot;Vwx&quot; are, in italics, the first letter of the genus and the first two letters of the species where this restriction endonuclease may be found, for example, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Eco&quot;, and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Hin&quot;. This is followed by the optional, non-italicized symbol &quot;y&quot;, which indicates the type or strain identification, for example, &quot;Eco&quot;R for &quot;E. coli&quot; strains bearing the drug resistance transfer factor RTF-1, &quot;Eco&quot;B for &quot;E. coli&quot; strain B, and &quot;Hin&quot;d for &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strain d. Finally, when a particular type or strain has several different restriction endonucleases, these are identified by Roman numerals, thus, the restriction endonucleases from &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strain d are named &quot;Hin&quot;dI, &quot;Hin&quot;dII, &quot;Hin&quot;dIII, etc. Another example: &quot;&quot;Hae&quot;II&quot; and &quot;&quot;Hae&quot;III&quot; refer to bacterium &quot;Haemophilus aegyptius&quot; (strain not specified), restriction endonucleases number II and number III, respectively. The restriction enzymes used in molecular biology usually recognize short target sequences of about 4 – 8 base pairs. For instance, the &quot;Eco&quot;RI enzyme recognizes and cleaves the sequence 5&#x27; – GAATTC – 3&#x27;.

Restriction endonucleases come in several types. A restriction endonuclease typically requires a recognition site and a cleavage pattern (typically of nucleotide bases: A, C, G, T). If the recognition site is outside the region of the cleavage pattern, then the restriction endonuclease is referred to as Type I. If the recognition sequence overlaps with the cleavage sequence, then the restriction endonuclease restriction enzyme is Type II.

== Processes involved with endonucleases ==
Endonucleases play a role in many aspects of biological life. Below are a couple examples of processes where endonucleases play a crucial role.

=== DNA repair ===
Endonucleases play a role in DNA repair. AP endonuclease, specifically, catalyzes the incision of DNA exclusively at AP sites, and therefore prepares DNA for subsequent excision, repair synthesis and DNA ligation. For example, when depurination occurs, this lesion leaves a deoxyribose sugar with a missing base. The AP endonuclease recognizes this sugar and essentially cuts the DNA at this site and then allows for DNA repair to continue. &quot;E. coli&quot; cells contain two AP endonucleases: endonuclease IV (endoIV) and exonuclease III (exoIII) while in eukaryotes, there is only one AP endonuclease.

==== DNA crosslink repair ====
Repair of DNA in which the two complementary strands are joined by an interstrand covalent crosslink requires multiple incisions in order to disengage the strands and remove the damage. Incisions are required on both sides of the crosslink and on both strands of the duplex DNA. In mouse embryonic stem cells, an intermediate stage of crosslink repair involves production of double-strand breaks. MUS81/EME1 is a structure specific endonuclease involved in converting interstrand crosslinks to double-strand breaks in a DNA replication-dependent manner. After introduction of a double-strand break, further steps are required to complete the repair process. If a crosslink is not properly repaired it can block DNA replication.

==== Thymine dimer repair ====
Exposure of bacteriophage (phage) T4 to ultraviolet irradiation induces thymine dimers in the phage DNA. The phage T4 &quot;denV&quot; gene encodes endonuclease V that catalyzes the initial steps in the repair of these UV-induced thymine dimers. Endonuclease V first cleaves the glycosylic bond on the 5’ side of a pyrimidine dimer and then catalyzes cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester bond that originally linked the two nucleotides of the dimer. Subsequent steps in the repair process involve removal of the dimer remnants and repair synthesis to fill in the resulting single-strand gap using the undamaged strand as template.

=== Apoptosis ===
During apoptosis, Apoptotic endonuclease DFF40 is activated to initiate controlled cellular disassembly. This disintegration is characterized by the cleavage of genomic DNA into specific fragments. The precise role of endonucleases in this context is to cleave the DNA at specific sites, generating fragments with defined lengths. These fragments are then packaged into apoptotic bodies, ensuring a neat and efficient removal of the dying cell without causing inflammation or damage to neighboring cells.

=== DNA Replication ===
Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and Dna2 endonuclease are integral to DNA replication on the lagging strand, participating in crucial processes such as primer removal and Okazaki fragment processing. Endonucleases are actively involved in processing these fragments by cleaving the phosphodiester bonds between them. This process is integral to the seamless synthesis and joining of Okazaki fragments, contributing to the overall continuity of the newly replicated DNA strand.

=== RNA Processing ===
Endonucleases, more specifically endoribonuclease, play a crucial role in RNA processing, a fundamental step in gene expression. This process involves the precise cleavage of precursor RNA molecules, guided by endonucleases, to generate functional RNAs essential for various cellular functions. Endonucleases selectively cleave precursor RNAs at specific sites, defining the boundaries of functional RNA segments during RNA processing. The outcome of RNA processing is the production of functional RNA molecules, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Endonucleases contribute to the precision of this process, ensuring the formation of mature and functional RNA species.

Endonucleases like RNase P and tRNase Z (ELAC2), shape precursor tRNAs into mature, functional tRNAs, crucial for accurate translation during protein synthesis. In ribosome biogenesis, endonucleases from the RNase III family, like DROSHA, play a role in processing precursor rRNAs, contributing to the assembly of functional ribosomes.

DICER and DROSHA also from the RNase III family play a role in the processing pre-miRNA to functional miRNA.

=== Maturation of Nails and Hairs ===
The endonuclease DNase1L2 also contribute prominently to the removal of DNA during the formation of hair and nails. This process is essential for the maturation of hair and nail structures and is crucial for the transformation of cells into durable and keratinized structures, ensuring the strength and integrity of hair and nails.

==Further discussion==

Restriction endonucleases may be found that cleave standard dsDNA (double-stranded DNA), or ssDNA (single-stranded DNA), or even RNA. This discussion is restricted to dsDNA; however, the discussion can be extended to the following:
* Standard dsDNA
* Non-standard DNA
# Holliday junctions
# Triple-stranded DNA, quadruple-stranded DNA (G-quadruplex)
# Double-stranded hybrids of DNA and RNA (one strand is DNA, the other strand is RNA)
# Synthetic or artificial DNA (for example, containing bases other than A, C, G, T, refer to the work of Eric T. Kool). Research with synthetic codons, refer to the research by S. Benner, and enlarging the amino acid set in polypeptides, thus enlarging the proteome or proteomics, see the research by P. Schultz.

In addition, research is now underway to construct synthetic or artificial restriction endonucleases, especially with recognition sites that are unique within a genome.

Restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes typically cleave in two ways: blunt-ended or sticky-ended patterns. An example of a Type I restriction endonuclease.

Furthermore, there exist DNA/RNA non-specific endonucleases, such as those that are found in &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, which act on dsDNA, ssDNA, and RNA.

== Common endonucleases ==

Below are tables of common prokaryotic and eukaryotic endonucleases.

== Mutations ==

Xeroderma pigmentosa is a rare, autosomal recessive disease caused by a defective UV-specific endonuclease. Patients with mutations are unable to repair DNA damage caused by sunlight.

Sickle Cell anemia is a disease caused by a point mutation. The sequence altered by the mutation eliminates the recognition site for the restriction endonuclease MstII that recognizes the nucleotide sequence.

tRNA splicing endonuclease mutations cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Pontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) represent a group of neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disorders that is caused by mutations in three of the four different subunits of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease complex.

<text>In economics, marginal concepts are associated with a &quot;specific change&quot; in the quantity used of a good or service, as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a &quot;border&quot; or &quot;margin&quot;. The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her &quot;endowment&quot;, broadly conceived to include opportunities. This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a &quot;marginal&quot; value. A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a &quot;marginal&quot; change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service. For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in neoclassical analysis that goods and services are continuously divisible. In such context, a marginal change may be an infinitesimal change or a limit. However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The marginal use of a good or service is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.

The marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease. In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the marginal use.

The marginal rate of substitution is the rate of substitution that is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A marginal benefit is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “marginal cost” may refer to an opportunity cost at the margin, or more narrowly to marginal pecuniary cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone cash flow.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* marginal physical product (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
**marginal product of labor
**marginal product of capital
* marginal rate of transformation, the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* marginal revenue product
* marginal propensity to save and consume
* marginal tax rate
* marginal efficiency of capital

Marginalism is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of elasticity is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

<text>Park Island Transport Company Limited (PITCL) is a non-franchised bus company in Hong Kong. Established in 2002, it operates bus and ferry services between Ma Wan Island and other parts of Hong Kong territory. It is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties, the conglomerate which developed the major private housing estate Park Island on Ma Wan island.

==History==
PITCL was established in 2002 as a joint venture between Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Ferry and Transport International (then known as Kowloon Motor Bus Holdings). In 2009, the business was sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties.

==Bus==
===Routes===
PITCL currently operates four bus routes:
*NR330: Ma Wan (Park Island) ⇔ Tsing Yi station (with NR330A during the peak hours and operated by Sun Bus)
*NR332: Ma Wan (Park Island) ⇔ Kwai Fong (between Metroplaza and Kwai Tsing Theatre, near Kwai Fong station)
*NR334: Ma Wan (Park Island) ⇔ Hong Kong International Airport Terminal 1 &amp; 2 via Cathay Pacific City
*NR338: Ma Wan (Park Island) ⇔ Central Piers (ferry replacement service, overnight route)

===Previous routes===
The following routes were handed over to Sun Bus on 15 December 2019
*NR331: Ma Wan (Pak Yan Road) ⇔ Tsuen Wan station
*NR331S: Ma Wan (Pak Yan Road) ⇔ Tsuen Wan West station and Nina Tower via Tai Ho Road Flyover

===Fleet===
PITCL commenced with six-second-hand Dennis Dart SLFs transferred from Kowloon Motor Bus. Between 2003 and 2008, due to the rapid growth of residents in Park Island, the company bought new Dennis Dart SPDs and the very first DesignLine Olymbus electronic-motivated HEV bus from New Zealand. The three DesignLine buses were withdrawn in 2008/2010.

List of current PITCL buses fleet:
* 5 Dennis Super Pointer Dart (3 of them with Luggage racks)
* 1 Toyota Coaster
* 8 Young Man JNP6122G
* 2 MAN NL323F
* 9 Alexander Dennis Enviro200
* 3 Sunlong Coaches

<text>Goa Gil (born Gilbert Levey, October 11, 1951 – October 26, 2023) was an American musician, DJ, remixer, and party organizer. He was one of the founders of the Goa trance and psytrance movement in electronic music.

==Biography==
Gilbert Levey was born on October 11, 1951, and grew up in San Rafael, California. He witnessed the birth of the hippie movement and acid rock, and was involved with the freak collectives The Family Dog and Sons of Champlin. Feeling that the San Francisco musical scene was falling apart, he took off in 1969, going first to Amsterdam and then to India, settling in Goa. Here he discovered the sadhus, wandering holy men living off the forest, covering themselves with ash. Soon, Gil himself became a Sadhu, Baba Mangalanand, in the order of the Juna Akhara, under the Guru, Mahant Nirmalanand Saraswati.

During the early 1980s, many Goa hippies were becoming increasingly fascinated with early electronic music such as Kraftwerk. Gil and his friends soon gathered some equipment and started DJing and playing live music all night long on the Goa beaches. The mix of outdoor electronic dance parties with Eastern mystical and spiritual overtones came to define the aesthetic of the psytrance movement. For Gil, dance is an active form of meditation and the use of trance music is a way to &quot;redefine the ancient tribal ritual for the 21st century&quot;. During the 1990s, the aesthetic of the Goa trance movement spread by way of European and Israeli backpackers who attended parties in India. 

Gil was interviewed for the 2001 documentary &quot;Last Hippie Standing&quot; which explored the scene in Goa. 

In January 2006, Gil DJ&#x27;ed the all-night closing party of the three-day LSD-symposium at Basel, Switzerland, in honor of LSD-inventor Albert Hofmann&#x27;s 100th birthday January 11, 2006, after Hofmann himself had delivered the closing speech of the symposium.

Goa Gil was married to Ariane. Together they formed the band the Nommos. Gil died of cancer on October 26, 2023, at the age of 72.

<doc id="1148574" wikidata="Q604482" url="?curid=1148574" title="List of UK singles chart number ones of the 1960s">
<text>The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. Prior to 1969 there was no official singles chart; however, The Official Charts Company and Guinness&#x27; British Hit Singles &amp; Albums regard the canonical sources as &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) before 10 March 1960 and &quot;Record Retailer&quot; from then until 15 February 1969 when &quot;Retailer&quot; and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile the charts. The choice to use &quot;Record Retailer&quot; as the canonical source for the 1960s has been contentious because &quot;NME&quot; (which continued compiling charts beyond March 1960) had the biggest circulation of periodicals in the decade and was more widely followed. 

As well as the chart compilers mentioned previously, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Disc&quot; and &quot;Record Mirror&quot; all compiled their own charts during the decade. Due to the lack of any official chart the BBC aggregated results from all these charts to announce its own &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; chart. One source explains that the reason for using the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart for the 1960s was that it was &quot;the only chart to have as many as 50 positions for almost the entire decade&quot;. The sample size of &quot;Record Retailer&quot; in the early 1960s was around 30 stores whereas &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; were sampling over 100 stores. In 1969, the first BMRB chart was compiled using postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops.

In terms of number-one singles, The Beatles were the most successful group of the decade having seventeen singles reach the top spot. The longest duration of a single at number-one was eight weeks and this was achieved on three occasions: &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot; by Elvis Presley in 1960; &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; by The Shadows in 1962 and &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; by The Archies in 1969. The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;She Loves You&quot; became the best-selling single of all time in 1963, a record it held until 1977 when band member Paul McCartney&#x27;s new band, Wings, surpassed it with &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;. &quot;She Loves You&quot; was the best-selling song of the decade and one of fourteen songs believed to have sold over one million copies in the 1960s.

==Number-one singles==




==By artist==
The following artists achieved three or more number-one hits during the 1960s.
==By record label==
The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 1960s.

==Million-selling and gold records==
The Shadows instrumental, &quot;Apache&quot;, is the oldest 1960s release to be awarded a gold record but not the first to actually receive the award. The awarding of seventeen gold records to records released in the 1960s is documented and, notably, five were awarded to releases by The Beatles. Although The Righteous Brothers first released &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; in August 1965 it had more success after being re-released in the 1990s reaching number one and selling over one million copies.

Notable films include &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (1980), &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; (1984), &quot;F/X&quot; (1986), &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1986), &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988), &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988), &quot;F/X2&quot; (1991), &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004), &quot;Australia&quot; (2008), &quot;Kill Me Three Times&quot; (2014) and &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot; (2016). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for his performance in the television miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983).

==Early life==
Brown was born in Panania, a south-western Sydney suburb, the son of salesman John &quot;Jack&quot; Brown and Molly Brown, a pianist in the early days of the Langshaw School of Ballet and a drama student at the Edith Paull Drama School, who also worked as a house cleaner. He grew up with his younger sister, Kristine, in Panania, and began working at AMP as an actuarial student. He started to act in amateur theatre performances, where he discovered a passion for acting.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Brown went to Britain in 1972 and eventually won minor roles at the Old Vic. He returned to Australia and became a member of the Genesian Theatre, Sydney. He appeared in Colleen Clifford&#x27;s production of &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, before joining the Queensland Theatre Company in 1975 for a tour of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;.

===Early films===
He made his cinema debut in &quot;Scobie Malone&quot; (1975) as a policeman. He delivered two lines and was listed last in the credits as &quot;Brian Bronn&quot;.

In 1977, he had the lead in a short feature, &quot;The Love Letters from Teralba Road&quot; (1977), which was written and directed by Stephen Wallace.

Brown had small roles in &quot;The Irishman&quot; (1978), which was directed by Donald Crombie, &quot;Weekend of Shadows&quot; (1978) from Tom Jeffrey, and &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; (1978), which was directed by Fred Schepisi.

He had a bigger part in &quot;Newsfront&quot; (1978), which was directed by Phil Noyce, the miniseries &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (1978), which was directed by Simon Wincer, and &quot;Money Movers&quot; (1978), which was directed by Bruce Beresford.

Brown had the lead in the low budget film &quot;Third Person Plural&quot; (1979) from James Ricketson and a key role in Jeffrey&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Angry Shot&quot; (1979) and Crombie&#x27;s &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Child&quot; (1979). He played the lead in a short for Wallace, &quot;Conman Harry and the Others&quot; (1979), and had a leading role in Albie Thoms&#x27; &quot;Palm Beach&quot; (1980).

In 1980, Brown became known to international audiences for his performance in &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, directed by Beresford.

===Stardom===
Brown played the leading role in Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Stir&quot; (1980). He had starring roles in &quot;Blood Money&quot; (1980), a thriller, and &quot;Winter of Our Dreams&quot; (1981), a relationship drama with Judy Davis written and directed by John Duigan.

Brown had a huge international success playing the lead role in the TV miniseries, &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; (1981), which won popularity in the United States. This co-starred Helen Morse and the two of them were reteamed in &quot;Far East&quot; (1982), written and directed by Duigan.

Brown had another big success internationally with his role as Luke O&#x27;Neil in &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983), starring Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward (whom he later married). Brown was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie for his work.

This led to a number of international offers for Brown. He had the lead in a British TV film, &quot;Kim&quot; (1984) (playing a British agent in Imperial India) and supported Paul McCartney in &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; (1984).

Brown returned to Australia for another miniseries from the makers of &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot; (1984), but it was not as popular.

===US career===
Brown was given the lead role in the US action film &quot;F/X&quot; (1986), which was a hit. However &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; (1986), directed by Daryl Duke from &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, was a huge flop, despite being based on a best seller by James Clavell.

Brown returned to Australia to make &quot;The Umbrella Woman&quot; (1987) with Ward and then a new version of &quot;The Shiralee&quot; (1987). He supported Tom Cruise in &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988) and Sigourney Weaver in &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1989).

In Australia he played the lead in a World War Two drama, &quot;Blood Oath&quot; (1990), directed by Wallace and did a romantic comedy based on a story by him and Tony Morphett, &quot;Sweet Talker&quot; (1991), directed by Mike Jenkins.

In the US he did &quot;F/X2&quot; (1991), a sequel to &quot;F/X&quot;, where he was also executive producer, and the TV film &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; (1991).

He did a comedy with Dudley Moore, &quot;Blame It on the Bellboy&quot; (1992), followed by some thrillers: &quot;Devlin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Last Hit&quot; (1993), and &quot;Age of Treason&quot; (1994); in the latter he was a detective in Ancient Rome.

In 1999 Brown starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Dear Claudia&quot; and had a support role in &quot;Two Hands&quot; (1999) with Heath Ledger and Rose Byrne.

In Australia he had a support role in &quot;Risk&quot; (2000) and the lead in &quot;On the Beach&quot; (2000) and &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; (2002) which he also produced.

His 2021 crime novel, &quot;Sweet Jimmy&quot;, was published by Allen &amp; Unwin in print and as audio book, narrated by Brown. &quot;Sweet Jimmy&quot; was highly praised by film historian and author Brian McFarlane, who called it &quot;an extraordinary piece of work&quot;.

His second book, &quot;The Drowning&quot;, was published in 2023 in print and as audio book, narrated by Brown.

===Production work===
Brown&#x27;s production company made the series &quot;Twisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Two Twisted&quot; (similar to &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;). The second series had an additional twist: both stories in each episode were connected in some way, and the audience was invited to try to spot the connection.

He received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (1980) and for &quot;Two Hands&quot; (1999).

The Bryan Brown Theatre &amp; Function Centre in Bankstown, Sydney, was named after him in 2013. He won Longford Lyell Award at the AACTA Awards in 2018.

<doc id="1148578" wikidata="Q2248335" url="?curid=1148578" title="Audio Lessonover?">
<text>Audio Lessonover? is the fourth studio album by the Christian rock band Delirious?, released in August 2001. It gathered considerably less critical acclaim than previous Delirious? albums, both musically and in its lack of overtly Christian lyrics. The sole single released from the album, &quot;Waiting for the Summer&quot;, reached number 26 in the UK Singles Charts; &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, originally planned to be the second single, was released to MP3.com as a free download.

== Background, writing and recording ==

Following the more experimental music of &quot;Mezzamorphis&quot; and &quot;Glo&quot;, Delirious aimed for a &quot;stripped-down&quot; pop sound on their new album, influenced by, among others, Coldplay, Radiohead, and the Manic Street Preachers. Many of the songs were recorded semi-live in the studio, giving the album a raw feel.

Chuck Zwicky (former engineer for Prince and Semisonic) was brought in to oversee production of the album. According to Stu G, Zwicky was very influential in the recording of the album: &quot;From our beginning we’ve really had a hands-on approach to the production. And we asked him to really take that on. So he did make a difference to the way we recorded the stuff and to really get a strip-down, more live performance. And that was really good to be pushed that way, and he pushed us really hard.&quot; The band also credit him with creating a retro sound: &quot;we walked into the studio and Tim [Jupp] started to set up, and Charles said (rather less politely) ‘Put them away, I&#x27;m not having that rubbish in my studio.&#x27; Instead, he got Tim to play analogue synths and Fender Rhodes through guitar pedals, and rather than relying on MIDI to do everything Tim was twisting knobs and creating audio canvasses that were absolutely incredible.&quot;

== Content ==

The album&#x27;s lyrical content differs somewhat from previous albums, including several love songs. Martin Smith said of the first single, &quot;Waiting for the Summer&quot;, &quot;The song came about because we were travelling to Brighton everyday and in usual style it was raining... We thought we&#x27;d write a song about waiting for the summer because we used to say to each other, &#x27;I can&#x27;t wait for summer&#x27;. It&#x27;s a love song about being with my lady in summer, laughing and dancing around.&quot; Another track, &quot;There is an Angel&quot;, was written by Smith about &quot;waking up one night and seeing my wife asleep in bed next to me and just thinking, God, I could mess this up if I&#x27;m not careful. She&#x27;s the angel you&#x27;ve put in my life and I need to protect what you&#x27;ve given me.&quot; Smith has said that the song is his all-time favourite.

Among the more obscure songs lyrically is another love song, &quot;Bicycle Gasoline&quot;; Smith has, however, explained it: &quot;girls, they don&#x27;t want flowers all the time, they just need telling that you love them, and vice-versa. A bicycle doesn&#x27;t need gasoline and she doesn&#x27;t need all that stuff really. She doesn&#x27;t need &#x27;things&#x27;, jewellery or dresses, she just needs love. You know, love man!&quot;

== Promotion and singles ==

During 2001, Delirious? embarked on an extensive publicity campaign, including supporting Bon Jovi and Matchbox 20 in the five-date &quot;One Wild Night&quot; UK stadium tour On the last date of the tour, the band announced a release date of 6 August for the album. Once again, mainstream chart success for the band was hindered by the refusal of BBC Radio One, the UK national pop station, to playlist the singles. The album title itself is an anagram of &quot;Radio One Loves Us&quot; reflecting past struggles for airplay on the station.

== Reception and critical response ==
The album received mixed reviews from the major music critics. Despite the band&#x27;s aim to create a pop album, some reviewers called &quot;Audio Lessonover?&quot; the band&#x27;s least accessible album to date; the Phantom Tollbooth, however, thought it the most accessible Delirious album yet. Q Magazine, the only mainstream magazine to review the album, praised the band&#x27;s &quot;complex, Muse-alike rock&quot;, commenting also on the band&#x27;s difficulty in catering to both the Christian and mainstream markets.

The album&#x27;s sales were lower than previous mainstream efforts, debuting at No. 58 in the UK Album Chart.

<doc id="1148580" wikidata="Q2917437" url="?curid=1148580" title="List of UK singles chart number ones of the 1970s">
<text>The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) on behalf of the British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and &quot;Record Retailer&quot; to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker&#x27;s afternoon show and later published in &quot;Record Retailer&quot; (rebranded &quot;Music Week&quot; in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.

In terms of number-one singles, ABBA were the most successful group of the decade having seven singles reach the top spot. The longest duration of a single at number-one was nine weeks and this was achieved on three occasions: &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen in 1975; &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; / &quot;Girls&#x27; School&quot; by Wings in 1977 and &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in 1978. Thirteen records were released that sold over one-million copies within the decade and &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; also became the first ever single to sell over two-million copies. In doing so it became the best-ever selling single beating the benchmark set by The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;She Loves You&quot; in 1963. &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; was also the biggest selling song of the decade and was not surpassed in physical sales until 1984 when Band Aid released &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

In 1973, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) was formed and they began certifying the sales of records at certain thresholds: &quot;silver&quot; (250,000 units), &quot;gold&quot; (500,000 units), and &quot;platinum&quot; (1,000,000 units). In 1977, the BPI held an awards ceremony at Wembley Conference Centre to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The event cost £25,000, honoured music from the last 25 years and is considered to be the first Brit Awards ceremony.

==Number-one singles==




==By artist==
The following artists achieved three or more number-one hits during the 1970s. Swedish group, ABBA, were the most successful artist of the decade in terms of number-one singles. They had seven number-ones: &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1974); &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (all 1976); &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (both 1977); and &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; (1978). Art Garfunkel also had three number-one hits, two as a solo artist and one as part of the duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel.

==By record label==
The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 1970s.

==Million-selling and platinum records==
In April 1973, the British Phonographic Industry began classifying singles and albums by the number of units sold. The highest threshold is &quot;platinum record&quot; and was then awarded to singles that sold over 1,000,000 units. Thirteen records were classified platinum in the 1970s and two number-one songs from the 1970s were classified as platinum in the subsequent decade. Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; subsequently sold over one-million copies but in 1985, after sales from its re-release were included.

Two other songs originally released in the 1970s became platinum and become million selling records but both were number-ones in a subsequent decade after being re-released: &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon charted at number six in 1975 but reached number one in 1981 following Lennon&#x27;s death at the end of the previous year and Tony Christie&#x27;s &quot;(Is This The Way To) Amarillo&quot; reached number eighteen in 1971 but later took top spot after being re-released as a charity single in 2005. Five number-ones – ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, Ian Dury and The Blockheads&#x27; &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot;, The New Seekers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot;, Julie Covington&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)&quot; – passed the million-sales mark following the introduction of music downloads in 2004.

== Songs with the most weeks at number one ==
The following songs spent at least six weeks at number one during the 1970s.

<doc id="1148583" wikidata="Q2975820" url="?curid=1148583" title="List of UK singles chart number ones of the 1980s">
<text>The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) on behalf of the British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on BBC Radio 1 at lunchtime and later published in &quot;Music Week&quot;. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.

During the 1980s there were a total of 191 singles which took the UK chart number 1 spot. In terms of number-one singles, Madonna was the most successful single act of the decade, as six of her singles reached the top spot. George Michael had significant involvement with eight number-one singles; with two number-one singles as a solo artist, four as a member of pop duo Wham!, one as a duet with Aretha Franklin and one as a member of charity supergroup Band Aid. The longest duration of a single at number one was nine weeks, achieved by Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Two Tribes&quot; in 1984.

The best-selling single of the decade was &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid, selling over 3.5 million copies, and passing &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; by Wings to become the best-selling single ever. &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; is currently the second best-selling song after &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; by Elton John.

The 1980s saw the introduction of the cassette single (or &quot;cassingle&quot;) alongside the 7-inch and 12-inch record formats and in 1987 major record labels developed a common format for the CD single. For the chart week ending 3 May 1989, chart regulations confined Kylie Minogue&#x27;s song &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot; to number two. Minogue would have reached number one if sales from cassette singles were included but they were sold for £1.99 – cheaper than was allowed at the time. Following the debacle the British Phonographic Industry reduced the minimum price for cassette singles to become eligible towards sales figures.

== Number-one singles ==


 




==By artist==
American entertainer Madonna was the most successful act of the decade in terms of number-one singles. She had six number ones: &quot;Into the Groove&quot; (1985); &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot; (both 1986); &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (both 1987); and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989). George Michael had significant involvement with seven number-one singles; he was also involved with Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; but his contribution was less significant. He had two number-one singles as a solo artist, four as a member of pop duo Wham!, and one as a duet with Aretha Franklin. The following artists achieved three or more number-one hits during the 1980s. 
Additionally, Adam Ant and Boy George each had one solo number one hit and two number one hits as lead singers of bands (Adam and the Ants and Culture Club respectively) totalling three number one hits each.

==By record label==

The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 1980s.

== Songs with the most weeks at number one ==
The following songs spent at least five weeks at number one during the 1980s.

==Million-selling and platinum records==
The British Phonographic Industry classified singles and albums since 1973 by the number of units sold, with the highest threshold being a &quot;platinum record&quot;. Before 1989, a platinum record was given to singles that sold over 1,000,000 units, a gold record for 500,000 unit sales and a silver record for 250,000. For singles released after 1 January 1989, the number of sales required to qualify for platinum, gold and silver records was dropped to 600,000 units (platinum), 400,000 units (gold) and 200,000 units (silver). Fifteen records were classified platinum in the 1980s. These include two songs from the 1970s that were classified platinum in the 1980s: Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, released in 1973, re-entered the charts and was classified platinum in 1980 and sold over one million copies by 1985. Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 release &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)&quot; was classified platinum at the beginning of 1980 and, although certified as selling 0.995 million units, is believed to have surpassed a million copies in the 1980s when sales not &quot;over-the-counter&quot; are included.

In the 1980s, twelve songs were released that were classified platinum in the decade; eleven of these also sold one million units in that time. The double A-side, &quot;Last Christmas&quot;&quot;Everything She Wants&quot; by Wham!, is notable for being the only million-selling single of the decade not to reach number one due to Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; being released at the same time. In addition, a new version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid II was released in December 1989 and was classified platinum in 1990 and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; (originally released in 1975), reached number one in 1981 following his death and sold over a million copies.

Twelve other songs originally released in the 1980s have since sold one million units, eleven of them following the introduction of music downloads in 2004. The other song released in the 1980s to sell a million copies is &quot;Blue Monday&quot; by New Order which charted in several years during the 80s, but was not listed as a million seller until later.

== Additional information ==
[No. 2]: The singles &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; peaked at number two in the UK singles chart. &quot;Last Christmas&quot; peaked at number two upon its original release, but eventually reached number one in 2021.

[No. 3]: &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was originally released as a 12&quot; single in 1983, where it peaked at number 9 in the UK Singles Chart. It was re-released in 7&quot; format in 1988 as &quot;Blue Monday 1988&quot; where it reached a higher peak of number 3. It has also been re-released on other occasions, most notably 1995. New Order&#x27;s label, Factory Records, were not a member of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) so they never received any sales certifications. However, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; sold more than one million units through combined sales total.

[No. 62]: &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; originally peaked in the UK at number 62 in 1982, but reached number 6 in 2010 following performances on &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

<text>The UK Singles Chart is a record chart compiled on behalf of the British record industry. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was compiled each week by Gallup – after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by The Chart Information Network (CIN) and it was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets – airplay statistics are not used in compiling the official UK Singles Chart. The chart week ran from Sunday to Saturday, and the Top 40 was first revealed on BBC Radio 1 on a Sunday. Record companies began making singles available to radio stations much further in advance of their release dates and making greater use of direct marketing techniques in the 1990s. As a result, the number of singles that entered the charts at number one increased dramatically, and it became commonplace for singles to enter the charts at the top and then plummet down the listing soon after.

During the decade, 206 singles reached the number-one position on the chart. &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; by New Kids on the Block reached number one on the first new chart of the decade, replacing &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid II which had been number one on the last chart issued in 1989. The longest spell at the top was achieved by Bryan Adams&#x27;s song &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, which spent 16 weeks at number one in 1991, beating the record for the longest unbroken run at the top of the charts which had been held by Slim Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Rose Marie&quot; since 1955. Wet Wet Wet and Whitney Houston also had runs of 10 or more weeks at number one during the 1990s. Although it only spent five weeks at number one, Elton John&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; / &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot; sold almost 5 million copies, becoming the biggest-selling single in UK history. Cher&#x27;s song &quot;Believe&quot; spent 7 weeks at number-one at the end of 1998 and became the biggest-selling single by a female artist in UK history. Also, Cher is the female solo artist with the most number-one singles in the 1990s (a total of three) and the female solo artist with most weeks at number one (13). The final number one of the decade was the double A-side &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; / &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; by Westlife. Take That and the Spice Girls share the distinction of having achieved the most number-one hits in the 1990s, with eight each.

==Number-one singles==






===Artists by total number of weeks at number-one===
=== Songs by total number weeks at number one ===
The following songs spent at least six weeks at number one during the 1990s.

==By artist==
The following artists achieved three or more number one hits during the 1990s. George Michael&#x27;s collaborations with Elton John and Queen, in which both acts received billing on the single&#x27;s cover, are counted for both acts. Appearances on the &quot;Perfect Day&quot; single are not included, as the individuals did not receive individual credit on the cover.

*A. Total does not include an appearance on the &quot;Perfect Day&quot; single.

==By record label==

The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 1990s.

==Million-selling and platinum records==
In April 1973, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) began classifying singles and albums by the number of units sold. In the 1990s the highest threshold was &quot;platinum record&quot; and was awarded to singles that sold over 600,000 units. In February 1987, the BPI introduced multi-platinum awards so if a single sold 1,200,000 units it was classified as 2×platinum, 1,800,000 units as 3×platinum, and so on.

Sixty-six records, including forty-seven number ones, were classified platinum in the 1990s and three other songs released in the 1990s were classified as platinum in the subsequent decade. Thirty records from the decade sold over one million units. Fourteen of these also went multi-platinum and &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; went nine times platinum and became the best-selling single of all time. &quot;Angels&quot; by Robbie Williams, &quot;Torn&quot; by Natalie Imbruglia, and &quot;Wonderwall&quot; by Oasis all sold over one million copies but failed to get to number one.

<doc id="1148589" wikidata="Q2578954" url="?curid=1148589" title="List of UK singles chart number ones of the 2000s">
<text>The UK singles chart is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British record industry. In the 2000s the chart week ran from Sunday to Saturday, and the top 40 singles were revealed each Sunday on BBC Radio 1. At the start of the decade, before the advent of legal music downloads, it was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, but in 2005 permanent downloads began to be included in the chart compilation.

During the 2000s, 274 singles reached the No. 1 position on the chart, the most of any decade so far. Over this period, Westlife were the most successful group and music act at reaching the top spot, with 11 No. 1 singles. Rihanna and Jay-Z&#x27;s song &quot;Umbrella&quot; spent 10 weeks at No. 1 in 2007, the longest spell at the top of the charts since Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s 1994 hit &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, which topped the charts for 15 weeks. The Internet allowed music to be heard by vast numbers of people on social networking sites such as YouTube and Myspace; it also increased piracy. This and the introduction of the UK Singles Downloads Chart in 2004 led to a decrease in record sales and a reduction in the number of copies sold of a No. 1 record on the singles chart. Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s &quot;Crazy&quot; became the first song to reach the top of the charts based on downloads alone in 2006, remaining at No. 1 for nine consecutive weeks.

Physical single sales had been falling for more than a decade but digital single sales finally turned the trend around in 2008 with combined physical and digital single sales growing 33% over the previous year. Lily Allen made herself known on the Internet through her Myspace page, and following this exposure, her debut single &quot;Smile&quot; peaked at No. 1. Three years later, her single &quot;The Fear&quot; topped the chart for four consecutive weeks, being the longest running No. 1 single of 2009.

Reality television shows played an important and influential role on the charts during the decade. Hear&#x27;Say won the original series of &quot;Popstars&quot; in 2000 and topped the charts with their debut single &quot;Pure and Simple&quot;. A trend developed as this feat was replicated by &quot;Pop Idol&quot; winners Will Young (2002) and Michelle McManus (2003), and runners-up Gareth Gates and Sam &amp; Mark; 2002 &quot;Fame Academy&quot; winner David Sneddon, and the winner of the first series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, Steve Brookstein, in 2005. Reality television winners did especially well during the Christmas season; every Christmas No. 1 from 2005 to 2008 came from an &quot;X Factor&quot; winner. Shayne Ward reached No. 1 in 2005 with &quot;That&#x27;s My Goal&quot;, and he was followed by Leona Lewis, Leon Jackson and Alexandra Burke. Girls Aloud, the &quot;&quot; winners, also had the Christmas No. 1 in 2002 with &quot;Sound of the Underground.&quot; Kelly Clarkson, the winner of the first series of &quot;American Idol&quot; achieved her first UK No. 1 single, &quot;My Life Would Suck Without You&quot;, in 2009.

The first No. 1 of the decade, the double-A side &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; / &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; by Westlife, was a holdover from the end of 1999. &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; by Rage Against the Machine was the final No. 1 of the decade. In January 2005, a landmark was reached as the re-release of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;One Night&quot; became the 1,000th single to reach No. 1 in the singles chart.

==Chart history==
In 2000, 42 songs (not including Westlife&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; / &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; which first reached number one at the end of 1999) hit the top spot, a UK charts record for most number ones in a calendar year. The year 2000 also holds the record for most consecutive weeks with a new number one, with a different single hitting the number-one spot every week from 24 June to 16 September.

Six songs returned to the top of the charts for two separate spells. These were; &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot; by S Club 7 (2001), &quot;Gotta Get thru This&quot; by Daniel Bedingfield (2001–2002), &quot;Call on Me&quot; by Eric Prydz (2004), &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; by Shakira featuring Wyclef Jean (2006) and &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; (2009) and &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; (2009) by the Black Eyed Peas. In addition, Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Bad Romance&quot; was number one in December 2009 and climbed back to the top in January 2010.

==Number-one singles==











==Statistics by decade==
===By artist===
The following artists achieved four or more number-one hits during the 2000s. A number of artists had number-one singles on their own as well as part of a collaboration. Madonna, Timbaland and Justin Timberlake&#x27;s song &quot;4 Minutes&quot;, for example, is counted for all three artists because they were credited on the cover, while &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; does not count for Timberlake as he did not receive artist credit on that track in order to avoid overexposure.

===Artists by total number of weeks at number one===
===Songs by total number of weeks at number one===
*A. Total includes appearances on Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Umbrella&quot; and Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;.
*B. Total does not include two weeks spent at number one at the end of 1999 with &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; / &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;.
*D. Total includes collaboration with Dizzee Rascal.
*E. Total includes Band Aid 20.
*F. Total includes credit as Brian Potter.

===By record label===

The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 2000s.

==Million-selling and Platinum records==
In April 1973, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) began classifying singles and albums by the number of units shipped. The highest threshold is &quot;Platinum&quot; which, since 1989, is awarded to singles with over 600,000 units.

In July 2013, the BPI started a process of automatic certification regardless of original release dates, and since July 2014 audio streaming is included in the calculation of units at 100 streams equivalent to 1 sale or shipment. Hence, many of the singles released in the 2000s have been awarded certification in the 2010s.

<doc id="1148591" wikidata="Q328016" url="?curid=1148591" title="Randall Woodfield">
<text>Randall Brent Woodfield (born December 26, 1950) is an American serial killer, serial rapist, kidnapper, robber, burglar and former football player who was dubbed the I-5 Killer or the I-5 Bandit by the media due to the crimes he committed along the Interstate 5 corridor running through Washington, Oregon and California. Before his capture, Woodfield was suspected of multiple sexual assaults and murders. Though convicted in only one murder, he has been linked to a total of 18 murders and is suspected of having killed up to as many as 44 people.

A native of Oregon, Woodfield was the third child of a prominent Newport family. He began to exhibit abnormal behaviors during his teenage years and was arrested for indecent exposure while still in high school. An athlete for much of his life, Woodfield played as a wide receiver for the Portland State Vikings and was drafted by the National Football League in 1974 to play for the Green Bay Packers, but was cut from the team during training after a series of indecent exposure arrests.

In 1975, Woodfield began a string of robberies and sexual assaults on women in Portland, which he committed at knifepoint. Between 1980 and 1981, he committed multiple murders in cities along the I-5 corridor; his earliest-documented murder was that of Cherie Ayers, a former classmate whom he had known since childhood, in October 1980. After committing numerous violent crimes, Woodfield was arrested in March 1981, and convicted in June of the murder of Shari Hull and attempted murder of her co-worker, Beth Wilmot. He was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 90 years. In a subsequent trial, he was convicted of sodomy and improper use of a weapon in a sexual assault case, receiving 35 additional years to his sentence.

Woodfield has never confessed to any of the crimes of which he has been accused or convicted. Though he has only been convicted of one murder and one attempted murder, he has been linked via DNA and other methods to numerous unsolved homicides in the ensuing decades. Authorities have estimated his total number of killings to be as many as 44. CBS News named him one of the deadliest serial killers in American history. He is currently incarcerated at the Oregon State Penitentiary.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Randall Woodfield was born on December 26, 1950, in Salem, Oregon, the third child of an upper-middle-class family. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was an executive at Pacific Northwest Bell. He has two older sisters, one of whom went on to become a doctor and the other an attorney. The Woodfield family was &quot;well-known and respected&quot; in their community.

Woodfield was raised in Otter Rock, Oregon, a small seaside town approximately north of Newport. Popular among his peers, he was a football star at Newport High School. Though his childhood was by all accounts stable, Woodfield began to exhibit sexually dysfunctional behaviors during junior high school, particularly exposing himself in public. While in high school, Woodfield exposed himself to a group of teenage girls on Yaquina Bay Bridge and was arrested. His football coaches helped conceal the incident to prevent him from being ousted from the team, though his parents forced him to attend therapy after the incident.

===College years and football career===
After graduating from high school, Woodfield&#x27;s criminal record was expunged and he attended Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, Oregon, later transferring to Portland State University in Portland in 1970, where he played for the Portland State Vikings as a wide receiver. At Portland State, he was active in Campus Crusade for Christ, an evangelical Christian student group, and lived in an apartment located on the South Park Blocks.

Gary Hamblet, Woodfield&#x27;s football coach, recalled: &quot;When he was with me, he was the nicest, most gentlemanly kid I ever knew. He was quiet and polite, hard-working and real coachable.&quot; Other teammates and peers of Woodfield recalled him as &quot;soft-spoken&quot; and &quot;kind of a loner&quot; who &quot;didn&#x27;t have a lot of friends,&quot; but noted his athleticism.

Despite his thriving in college, Woodfield was arrested on several occasions for petty crimes: first in 1970 for vandalizing the apartment of his ex-girlfriend, and later in 1972 for public indecency in Vancouver, Washington. In 1973 he was arrested again for public indecency in Multnomah County, Oregon.

Woodfield chose to drop out of college three semesters shy of graduating with his B.S. in physical education, and was selected as a wide receiver in the 1974 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers in the 17th round (428th pick). Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine&#x27;s last season, but could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team&#x27;s final roster.

After being cut by the Packers, Woodfield played the 1974 season with the semi-pro Manitowoc Chiefs and worked for Oshkosh Truck.

===First crime spree===
Woodfield left Wisconsin in late 1974 and returned to Portland, feeling disgraced by his failure to maintain his football career. In early 1975, several Portland women were accosted by a knife-wielding man, forced to perform oral sex and then robbed of their handbags. Law enforcement responded to the string of crimes by having female police officers act as decoys.

On March 3, 1975, Woodfield was arrested after being caught with marked money from one of the undercover officers. Upon interrogation he confessed to the crimes, blaming poor sexual impulse control, which he claimed was a result of his use of steroids. In April 1975, Woodfield pled guilty to reduced charges of second-degree robbery. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, but was freed on parole in July 1979 after having served four years.

==Murders and subsequent crimes==
===First murders===
On October 9, 1980, Cherie Lynn Ayers, an X-ray technician and former classmate of Woodfield, was raped and murdered in her apartment at SW Ninth Place in downtown Portland. Her body was discovered on October 11 by her fiancé. She had been bludgeoned and stabbed repeatedly in the neck. Ayers, a University of Oregon graduate, had known Woodfield since second grade, having attended the same schools in Newport.

During Woodfield&#x27;s prior four-year imprisonment, he and Ayers had corresponded via letters. Suspecting Woodfield&#x27;s involvement in Cherie Lynn&#x27;s murder, Ayers&#x27; family provided his name to law enforcement. He was questioned but refused to sit for a polygraph test. Homicide detectives found his answers generally &quot;evasive and deceptive&quot; but, because his blood type did not match semen found in the victim&#x27;s body, no charges were filed.

One month later, on the morning of November 27 (Thanksgiving Day), Woodfield arrived at the north Portland home of Darcey Renee Fix, 22, planning to assault her. Woodfield had known Fix during college as an ex-girlfriend of one his close friends. Douglas Keith Altig, 24, was at Fix&#x27;s home when Woodfield arrived. Both Fix and Altig were subsequently bound and shot to death execution-style in the home, and Fix&#x27;s .32 caliber revolver was missing from the scene. Due to his acquaintance with Fix, Woodfield was questioned about the murders, but law enforcement found no concrete evidence pointing to his involvement.

===I-5 Bandit robberies===

After committing the murders of Fix and Altig, Woodfield began a series of robberies throughout the Pacific Northwest: On December 9, 1980, Woodfield, wearing a fake beard, held up a Vancouver, Washington, gas station at gunpoint. In Eugene, Oregon, four nights later, on December 13, he raided an ice cream parlor. On December 14, he robbed a drive-in restaurant in Albany, Oregon. During one of the robberies, Woodfield wore what appeared to be a Band-Aid or athletic tape across the bridge of his nose, similar to nasal strips worn by football players. On December 21, Woodfield (again wearing a false beard) accosted a waitress in Seattle, trapping her in a restaurant bathroom and forcing her at gunpoint to masturbate him.

By January 1981, law enforcement had dubbed the robber the &quot;I-5 Bandit&quot;, given his apparent preference for committing crimes along the Interstate 5 corridor. On January 8, he held up the same Vancouver gas station he had robbed in December, this time forcing a female attendant to expose her breasts after he emptied the cash register. Three days later, on January 11, he robbed a market in Eugene. The next day, January 12, he shot and wounded a female grocery clerk at a store in Sutherlin, Oregon.

On January 14, a man matching the description of the I-5 Bandit and wearing a false beard invaded a home occupied by two sisters, aged eight and ten. He ordered the girls to undress and sexually assaulted them, forcing the older girl to perform fellatio. Four days later, in Salem, a man matching the same description entered an office building and sexually abused two women, Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot, after which he killed Hull and wounded Wilmot, leaving her for dead. On January 26 and 29, he traveled to southern Oregon and committed robberies in Eugene, Medford and Grants Pass. In the latter location, two females, a clerk and customer, were assaulted by the robber.

===Later murders===
On February3, 1981, the bodies of Donna Eckard, 37, and her 14-year-old daughter, Janell Charlotte Jarvis, were found together in a bed in their home in Mountain Gate, California, north of Redding. Each had been shot several times in the head. Forensic tests showed that the girl had also been sexually assaulted. The same day in Redding, a female store clerk was kidnapped and raped in a holdup. An identical crime was reported in Yreka, California on February 4, with the same man robbing an Ashland, Oregon motel that night.

Then on February 9, in Corvallis, a man matching the I-5 Bandit&#x27;s description held up a fabric store, molested the clerk and her customer before he left. Three days later, robberies committed by a man matching the I-5 Bandit&#x27;s description occurred in Vancouver, Olympia, and Bellevue, Washington. The Olympia and Bellevue incidents included three sexual assaults.

Upon an impending visit to Portland, Woodfield planned a Valentine&#x27;s Day party at the city&#x27;s downtown Marriott Hotel, inviting friends and acquaintances from college. After no guests came, Woodfield drove to the Beaverton home of 18-year-old Julie Reitz, who he had met while working as a bouncer at The Faucet, a bar in Portland. He arrived at her home around 2:00a.m. on February15. Around 4:00a.m. he raped and then shot Reitz in the head, killing her. Police investigating the scene determined that Reitz had had a glass of wine with her attacker and had also begun to prepare coffee; a package of instant coffee was discovered on the kitchen counter, and water in a kettle had been left to completely boil away.

==Arrest and trials==
By February 28, the investigation was now focused on Woodfield, but by then the I-5 Bandit had struck three more in Eugene on February18 and 21, and with another sexual assault in Corvallis on February25. Detectives in Marion County assembled a call log showing Woodfield had placed calls via calling cards at payphones near the murder sites around the times they were committed.

On March5, 1981, Woodfield was brought into the Salem Police Department for an interrogation after Lisa Garcia positively identified him in a photo lineup. His apartment in Springfield, Oregon, was subsequently searched two days later by warrant; inside, law enforcement discovered a spent .32 shell casing inside a racquetball bag, as well as a roll of tape that matched the tape found on the victims. On March7, Woodfield was taken into custody after being positively identified by several Oregon robbery victims. On March16, indictments for murder, rape, sodomy, attempted kidnapping, armed robbery, and illegal possession of firearms were initiated from various jurisdictions in Washington and Oregon.

In the summer of 1981, Woodfield was tried in Salem for the murder of Hull, as well as charges of sodomy and attempted murder (of Wilmot). Wilmot testified against him in the trial, and was key in the prosecution&#x27;s conviction. Chris Van Dyke, son of actor Dick Van Dyke, was the Marion County District Attorney at the time and prosecuted the case. Van Dyke would later characterize Woodfield as &quot;the coldest, most detached defendant I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; On June26, 1981, after three-and-a-half hours of deliberation, Woodfield was convicted on all counts and sentenced to life in prison plus 90 years.

In October 1981, a second trial was held in Benton County, Oregon, in which Woodfield received sodomy and weapons charges tied to one of the attacks in a restaurant bathroom. Prior to this trial, his counsel attempted to move the trial from the Willamette Valley; he felt that, owing to the publicity the case received, Woodfield would not get a fair trial there. The judge in the case denied counsel&#x27;s request, along with a request to hypnotize a prosecution witness in an effort to determine if that witness had been influenced by the media coverage. Woodfield was convicted by the jury, and had an additional 35 years added to his already-instated sentence.

Despite the apparent links with countless other crimes and homicides, Woodfield would not be prosecuted for the majority of the crimes he was believed to have committed. Unable to afford multiple trials, the State of Oregon was satisfied with Woodfield&#x27;s existing life sentence.

==Post-conviction==
Woodfield is serving his sentences at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. In October 1983, he was injured by a fellow inmate during a prison disturbance. In April 1987, he filed a $12 million libel suit against Ann Rule, the author who had written &quot;The I-5 Killer&quot;, an account of Woodfield&#x27;s life and crime spree, in 1984. The Federal Court in Oregon dismissed the lawsuit in January 1988, citing that the statute of limitations on such a lawsuit had expired.

By 1990, after the discovery of more victims, Woodfield was suspected in as many as 44 homicides. In 2001 and 2006, DNA testing linked Woodfield to two additional murders in Oregon that occurred from 1980 and 1981.

During his time in the penitentiary, Woodfield has married three times and divorced twice. Some letters he wrote from prison were sold online as a collection titled &quot;The Serial Killer Letters&quot; and published by The Charles Press. In one of these letters, he wrote to journalist Jennifer Furio:
==&quot;Modus operandi&quot; and victim profile==

The majority of Woodfield&#x27;s victims were thin white women in their twenties, many of middle-class backgrounds. A great many of his victims—particularly in instances of robbery and sexual assault—were young employees of restaurants and convenience stores located along Interstate 5, which Woodfield traversed in his 1974 Champagne Edition gold Volkswagen Beetle. In some instances, Woodfield&#x27;s attacks were undertaken entirely at random, while in others, the murders were incited by rejected sexual advances. His level of acquaintance with his victims varied; some he knew personally, while others were complete strangers.

During his robberies, assaults, and killings, Woodfield typically concealed his identity by wearing a hoodie, a fake beard, and most curiously, a strip of athletic tape across his nose. Police believe Woodfield may have done so to obscure his features and prevent victims from identifying him in a police lineup. His victims were typically killed via gunshot, and his crimes were sexually motivated.

Jim Lawrence, a detective for Portland&#x27;s cold case unit, noted Woodfield&#x27;s lack of remorse or responsibility in his crimes, saying: &quot;If you’re talking about somebody moving toward some form of rehabilitation, they had to at some point acknowledge they are responsible for their own behaviors. That is not Randy Woodfield.&quot; Lawrence also noted Woodfield&#x27;s egotism during his early interrogations: &quot;When he was interviewed, he&#x27;d tell detectives that he&#x27;d never rape a girl. He said he didn&#x27;t have to. They wanted him.&quot; Ann Rule, who documented Woodfield&#x27;s crimes in &quot;The I-5 Killer&quot;, suggested that rejection and feelings of inadequacy were factors that drove him to violence, particularly against women. She also characterized Woodfield as a &quot;smooth ladies&#x27; man&quot; whose good looks and disposition aided his ability to trap victims.

Unlike many serial killers, whose killing patterns are characterized by intervals or &quot;cooling off periods,&quot; Woodfield&#x27;s murders and other crimes escalated rapidly, increasing in successive frequency.

==Victims==
Woodfield never confessed to any of the murders of which he has been convicted, accused or to which he has been linked. Though convicted only in the murder of Shari Hull, Woodfield has been linked to numerous other murders via DNA and other methods; criminologists and detectives have provided estimated total numbers of killings ranging from 25 to as many as 44 unsolved homicides. Woodfield is also estimated to have committed at least 60 unsolved rapes. The following is a list of Woodfield&#x27;s confirmed victims:

===1980===
; October 9: Cherie Lynn Ayers (29): A former classmate of Woodfield&#x27;s; was found in her Portland home on October 11; was bludgeoned and stabbed multiple times in the neck.
; November 27: Darcey Renee Fix (22) and Douglas Keith Altig (24): Both found shot to death with a .32 revolver in Fix&#x27;s North Portland home.
; December 21: Unnamed woman (25): Assaulted at gunpoint in a Seattle restroom, forced to masturbate Woodfield; survived.

===1981===
; January 12: Susie Benet (20): A market clerk in Sutherlin, Oregon, shot by Woodfield during robbery; survived.
; January 18: Shari Lynn Hull (20) and Beth Wilmot (20): Employees at a Transamerica office in Keizer, Oregon, accosted by Woodfield during their evening work shift; sexually assaulted both women before shooting them each in the head. Hull died of her injuries; Wilmot survived.
; February 3: Unnamed woman (18): Kidnapped at gunpoint and raped near Redding, California in the morning hours; survived.
: Donna Lee Eckard (37) and daughter Janell Charlotte Jarvis (14): Both found sexually assaulted and shot to death in their Shasta County home.
; February 4: Unnamed woman: Kidnapped and raped in Yreka, California; survived.
; February 15: Julie Ann Reitz (18): Raped and shot to death in her Beaverton, Oregon home around 4:00a.m.; was an acquaintance of Woodfield&#x27;s through his job as a bartender.

===Other possible victims===
Retracing Woodfield&#x27;s movements along Interstate 5, law enforcement have identified at least 25 other potential murders, while other estimations suggest up to 44. Notable is Martha Morrison (17), who disappeared in Eugene in September 1974 and was found murdered the following month near Vancouver; her remains were unidentified until 2015. Both Woodfield and Ted Bundy have been considered suspects in her murder. However, after Morrison&#x27;s remains were identified, law enforcement reached out to the public in an effort to encourage people to come forward with tips. In August 2017, a bloodstain on a pistol owned by a longtime suspect, Warren Forrest, was matched to Morrison through DNA testing.

During the spring of 1980, Marsha Weatter (19) and Kathy Allen (18) vanished while hitch-hiking from the Spokane, Washington, area to their hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska. Their bodies were found in May 1981, covered by several inches of ash from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Suspected serial killer Martin Lee Sanders was later connected to their murders, but as of 2018 the case remains unsolved.

==In popular culture==
In 2011, Woodfield was the subject of a Lifetime television film &quot;Hunt for the I-5 Killer&quot;, based on Ann Rule&#x27;s book. In the film, Woodfield is portrayed by Canadian actor Tygh Runyan.

<text>A research university or a research-intensive university is a university that is committed to research as a central part of its mission. They are &quot;the key sites of knowledge production&quot;, along with &quot;intergenerational knowledge transfer and the certification of new knowledge&quot; through the awarding of doctoral degrees, and continue to be &quot;the very center of scientific productivity&quot;. They can be public or private, and often have well-known brand names.

Undergraduate courses at many research universities are often academic rather than vocational and may not prepare students for particular careers, but many employers value degrees from research universities because they teach fundamental life skills such as critical thinking. Globally, research universities are overwhelmingly public institutions, while some countries like the United States and Japan also have well-known private research institutions.

Institutions of higher education that are not research universities or do not aspire to that designation, such as liberal arts colleges, instead place more emphasis on student instruction or other aspects of tertiary education, whereas research university faculty members, in contrast, are under more pressure to publish or perish.

== History ==
===19th century===
The concept of the research university first arose in early 19th-century Prussia in Germany, where Wilhelm von Humboldt championed his vision of (the unity of teaching and research), as a means of producing an education that focused on the main areas of knowledge, including the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, rather than on the previous goals of the university education, which was to develop an understanding of truth, beauty, and goodness.

Roger L. Geiger, &quot;the leading historian of the American research university,&quot; has argued that &quot;the model for the American research university was established by five of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution (Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Columbia); five state universities (Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and California); and five private institutions conceived from their inception as research universities (MIT, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Chicago).&quot; The American research university first emerged in the late 19th century, when these fifteen institutions began to graft graduate programs derived from the German model onto undergraduate programs derived from the British model. At Johns Hopkins, president Daniel Coit Gilman led the development of the American research university by setting high standards for recruiting faculty and admitting students, and insisting that faculty members had to commit to both teaching and research.

===20th century===
Research universities were essential to the establishment of American hegemony by the end of the 20th century. Most importantly, Berkeley, Chicago, Columbia, and Princeton (along with Birmingham and Cambridge in the UK) directly participated in the creation of the first nuclear weapons (the Manhattan Project). Besides that, Columbia and Harvard were instrumental in the early development of the American film industry (Hollywood), MIT and Stanford were leaders in building the American military–industrial complex and developing artificial intelligence, and Berkeley and Stanford played a central role in the development of Silicon Valley. The &quot;most prestigious group of research universities&quot; in the United States is the Association of American Universities.

Since the 1960s, American research universities, especially the leading American public research university system, the University of California, have served as models for research universities around the world. Having one or more universities based on the American model (including the use of English as a lingua franca) is a badge of &quot;social progress and modernity&quot; for the contemporary nation-state. 

===21st century===

The Americans&#x27; continued dominance into the early 21st century has forced their European counterparts to confront the urgent need for reform to avoid &quot;declining into an advanced form of feeder colleges for the best American universities.&quot; During that same timeframe, several wealthy petrostates in the Persian Gulf region subsidized the creation of local branches of American universities. When that approach proved insufficient to establish indigenous research and startup ecosystems (to support the planned long-term diversification of their economies away from petroleum), they started to build their own research universities from the ground up by recruiting Western-trained faculty and staff.

==Characteristics==

John Taylor, Professor of Higher Education Management at the University of Liverpool, defines the key characteristics of successful research universities as:
* &quot;Presence of pure and applied research&quot;
* &quot;Delivery of research-led teaching&quot;
* &quot;Breadth of academic disciplines&quot;
* &quot;High proportion of postgraduate research programmes&quot;
* &quot;High levels of external income&quot;
* &quot;An international perspective&quot;

Philip Altbach defines a different, although similar, set of key characteristics for what research universities need to become successful:
* At the top of the academic hierarchy in a differentiated higher education system and receiving appropriate support
* Overwhelmingly public institutions
* Little competition from non-university research institutions, unless these have strong connections to the universities
* More funding than other universities to attract the best staff and students and support research infrastructure
* Adequate and sustained budgets
* Potential for income generation from student fees and intellectual property
* Suitable facilities
* Autonomy
* Academic freedom

A 2012 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report defined research universities, in the American context, as having values of intellectual freedom, initiative and creativity, excellence, and openness, with such additional characteristics as:
* Being large and comprehensive – Clark Kerr&#x27;s &quot;multiversity&quot;
* Emphasizing the undergraduate residential experience (flagged specifically as distinguishing American research universities from those in continental Europe)
* Integrating graduate education with research
* Having faculty engaged in research and scholarship
* Conducting research at high levels
* Having enlightened and bold leadership

Global university rankings use metrics that primarily measure research to rank universities. Some also have criteria for inclusion based on the concept of a research university such as teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate level and conducting work in multiple faculties (&quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;), or teaching undergraduates, having a research output of more than 1000 research papers over 5 years, and no more than 80% of activity in a single subject area (&quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings)&quot;.

The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education in the United States designates institutions that spend on average at least $2.5 million on research and development annually as &#x27;research universities and colleges&#x27;, with further designations of &#x27;research 2: high spending and doctorate production&#x27; and &#x27;research 1: very high spending and doctorate production&#x27; for institutions spending over $5 million and awarding 20 or more doctorates per year and institutions spending over $50 million and awarding 70 or more doctorates per year respectively. there were 187 R1 universities, 139 R2 universities and 216 other research universities in the US out of 3941 total institutions classified.

==Worldwide distribution==
The &quot;QS World University Ranking&quot; for 2021 included 1002 research universities. The region with the highest number was Europe, with 39.8%, followed by Asia/Pacific with 26.7%, the US and Canada with 15.6%, Latin America with 10.8%, and the Middle East and Africa with 7%. All regions except the Middle East and Africa were represented in the top 100. The largest number of new entrants to the rankings were from East Asia and Eastern Europe, followed by Southern Europe. By individual country, the US had the most institutions with 151, followed by the UK with 84, China with 51 and Germany with 45. The top 200 showed a similar pattern with the US having 45 universities, the UK 26 and Germany 12. By comparison, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (2015) identified 115 US universities as &quot;Doctoral Universities: Highest Research Activity&quot; and a further 107 as &quot;Doctoral Universities: Higher Research Activity&quot;, while Altbach estimated that there were around 220 research universities in the US in 2013.

The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; for 2020 showed a similar distribution, with 185 of their 500 ranked institutions coming from Europe, 161 from the Americas, 149 from Asia/Oceania and five from Africa. All regions except Africa were represented in the top 100, although the Americas were represented solely by universities from the United States and Canada. In 2024, the US had the most universities in the top 500 from a single country, 114, followed by China with 103, the UK with 35 and Germany with 35. The top 200 shows the similar pattern: the US with 59 followed by China with 37 and the UK with 20.

The 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; only gave a breakdown by country and only for its top 200; this again had the US at the top with 56, followed by the UK with 25, Germany with 21 and China with 13. The top 200 featured one university from Africa, the University of Cape Town in South Africa, but none from Latin America. The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global Universities Ranking 2021 gave numbers by country for the 1500 universities ranked from 86 countries: the US was again top, with 255, followed by China with 176 and the UK with 87. The 2024 &quot;CWTS Leiden Ranking&quot; included 1,506 universities in the rankings from 65 countries: China topped the list, with 313, followed by the US with 206 and the UK with 63.

<text>HMS &quot;Tonnant () was an 80-gun [[ship of the line]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She had previously been Tonnant&quot; of the French Navy and the lead ship of the . The British captured her in August 1793 during the Siege of Toulon but the French recaptured her when the siege was broken in December. Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson captured her at Aboukir Bay off the coast of Egypt at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. She was taken into British service as HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot;. She went on to fight at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane when he assumed command of the North American Station in March of 1814 during the War of 1812 with the United States. On 7 September 1814 Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner dined aboard the ship while seeking the release of a captured civilian prisoner, several days before the Battle of Baltimore. Key went on to write what later became the words to the American national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; after watching the British attack on Baltimore&#x27;s Fort McHenry. &quot;Tonnant&quot; was broken up in 1821.

==French service==

&quot;Tonnant&quot; was the lead ship in a class of 80-gun two-deckers built to a design by Jacques-Noël Sané, and ordered on 19 October 1787. She was laid down at the Toulon Dockyard in November 1787 and launched on 24 October 1789. Anglo-Spanish forces captured her there in August 1793, but left her when they withdrew in December. She then reverted to the French Navy.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; fought in the battles of Genoa on 14 March 1795 and The Nile on 1 August 1798 under Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars. During the battle, she severely damaged , causing nearly two hundred casualties, including 50 killed and 143 wounded. Among the dead was &quot;Majestic&quot;″s captain, George Blagdon Westcott. Du Petit-Thouars, who had both legs and an arm shot off, commanded his ship until he died. &quot;Tonnant&quot; was the only French ship still engaged in the morning, with her colours flying, though aground. It was not until 3 August that she finally struck her colours.

The British took her into their service, registering and naming her as HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot; on 9 December 1798. She arrived at the naval base at Plymouth, England on 17 July 1799. Even before she formally entered British service, she was among the vessels that participated in the capture of the Greek vessel &quot;Ardito&quot; on 24 October 1798.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; was commissioned under Captain Loftus Bland in January 1799, with Captain Robert Lewis Fitzgerald taking over in February. He sailed her to Gibraltar and then back to Britain. Upon her arrival in Plymouth in 1800 she was laid up in ordinary.

== British service ==
===Napoleonic Wars===
&quot;Tonnant&quot; underwent repairs between December 1801 and April 1803. She was commissioned in March 1803 under Captain Sir Edward Pellew. Under his command she participated in the Blockade of Ferrol.

On 24 May the cutter &quot;Resolution&quot; captured &quot;Esperance&quot; and &quot;Vigilant&quot;, with &quot;Tonnant&quot; sharing in the capture. Next, &quot;Tonnant&quot;, and captured the Dutch ships &quot;Coffee Baum&quot; and &quot;Maasluys&quot; on 2 and 4 June. &quot;Tonnant&quot; then was one of the vessels that shared in the recapture on 27 August of .

&quot;Tonnant&quot; was part of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder&#x27;s squadron off Cape Ortegal when she encountered the French ships &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; and &quot;Guerrière&quot; on 2 September 1803. The two French Navy warships had broken out of the blockade when they met &quot;Tonnant&quot;. They escaped her but British naval forces of varying strengths harried them during their journey back to port and they only just made it to the safety of A Coruña.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; shared in the capture of &quot;Perseverance&quot; on 28 October, though the prize money was much less. Then on 29 November, destroyed &quot;Bayonnoise&quot;; &quot;Tonnant&quot; was among the vessels sharing, by agreement, in the bounty money. In the new year, on 18 February 1804, &quot;Tonnant&quot; and the ships of the squadron recaptured the brig &quot;Eliza&quot;.

Later in 1804 &quot;Tonnant&quot; was in the Channel under Captain William Henry Jervis. He drowned off Brest when going in his gig from &quot;Tonnant&quot; to on 26 January 1805. Jervis had just arrived from Rochefort and was anxious to impart his intelligence to the commander-in-chief. Captain Charles Tyler replaced Jervis in March.
During the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) she captured the 74-gun . &quot;Tonnant&quot; lost 26 officers and men killed and 50 officers and men wounded in the battle, with Tyler being among the wounded.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; underwent a refit at Portsmouth between January and June 1806. She was recommissioned in May under Captain Thomas Browne. She then served as flagship for Rear-Admiral Eliab Harvey. While under his command distinguished herself in a number of small cutting out expeditions.

In July 1807 she was under Captain Richard Hancock and served as flagship for Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy. In 1809 she was under the command of Captain James Bowen when she recaptured &quot;Ann of Leith&quot; on 8 April. &quot;Tonnant&quot; then was among the vessels sharing in the captures of &quot;Goede Hoop&quot; on 9 July and &quot;Carl Ludwig&quot; on 2 August.

Between November and December 1809 she was under repair at Plymouth. In 1810 she served under Captain Sir John Gore. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; reported on 14 June 1811 that French privateer &quot;Adolphe&quot; had captured &quot;George and Mary&quot;, but that &quot;Tonnant&quot; had recaptured &quot;George and Mary&quot;, which had been sailing from the West Indies and which arrived in Plymouth on 11 June.

On 24 March 1812, still under the command of Gore, &quot;Tonnant&quot; was off Ushant when she captured the French privateer &quot;Emilie&quot;. &quot;Emilie&quot; was armed with twelve 10-pounder guns and had a crew of 84 men. She was nine days out of Saint-Malo and had captured one vessel, a Spanish merchant ship that the Royal Navy had recaptured on the 24th. At the time that she captured &quot;Emilie&quot;, &quot;Tonnant&quot; was in company with , , , and . Then on 18 April &quot;Tonnant&quot; captured &quot;Martha&quot;. On 12 May, captured &quot;Betsy&quot;. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; was in company with &quot;Tonnant&quot;, , , and . &quot;Tonnant&quot; then again underwent repair between August and December 1812, this time at Chatham.

===War of 1812===
&quot;Tonnant&quot; joined the War of 1812 late. She was fitted for sea in the first quarter of 1814, being recommissioned in January under Captain Alexander Skene. &quot;Tonnant&quot; served as the flagship for Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane during the final months of the campaign in Chesapeake Bay. From her he directed attacks on Washington, D.C., Baltimore and then the final Battle of New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico. From March 1814 she was under the command of Captain John Wainwright. In October 1814 Captain Charles Kerr assumed command.

====&quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;====
It was aboard &quot;Tonnant&quot; near the mouth of the Potomac River, on 7 September 1814 that the Americans, Colonel John Stuart Skinner and Francis Scott Key, dined with Vice Admiral Cochrane, Major General Robert Ross, Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn and Rear Admiral Edward Codrington. They were pleading for the release of a civilian prisoner, Dr. William Beanes. After his release, Skinner, Key and Beanes were then transferred to the frigate HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; and later allowed to return to their own truce vessel sloop, but were not allowed to return to Baltimore because they had become familiar with the strength and position of British units and knew of the British intention to attack Baltimore. As a result, Key witnessed the bombarding of Fort McHenry (September 13 and 14) and was inspired to write a poem called &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, later named &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. During the bombardment, HMS provided the &quot;rockets red glare&quot; whilst HMS &quot;Meteor&quot; (along with four other bomb vessels) provided the &quot;bombs bursting in air&quot; that feature in the lyrics.

====The body of Major General Ross====
After Major General Robert Ross&#x27;s death in the Battle of North Point, his body was stored in a barrel of 129 gallons (586 L) of Jamaican rum aboard &quot;Tonnant&quot;. When she was diverted to New Orleans for the forthcoming battle (see above), the body was later shipped on the British ship to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where his body was interred on 29 September 1814 in the Old Burying Ground.

====New Orleans====
&quot;Tonnant&quot; continued to serve Cochrane as a flagship when he directed the British naval forces at the Battle of New Orleans. Immediately before the battle, ship&#x27;s boats from &quot;Tonnant&quot; participated in the British victory at the Battle of Lake Borgne.

On 8 December 1814, two US gunboats fired on , and the sixth-rate frigate while they were passing the chain of small islands that runs parallel to the shore between Mobile and Lake Borgne.

Between 12 and 15 December 1814, Captain Lockyer of &quot;Sophie&quot; led a flotilla of 42 boats, barges, launches and 3 unarmed gigs to attack the US gunboats. Lockyer drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun third rates and &quot;Tonnant&quot;, and a number of other vessels including &quot; Armide&quot;, &quot;Seahorse&quot;, and &quot;Meteor&quot;.

Lockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one. Captain Montresor of the gun-brig &quot;Manly&quot; commanded the second, and Captain Roberts of &quot;Meteor&quot; commanded the third. After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph&#x27;s Island. On 13 December 1814, the British attacked the one-gun schooner . On the morning of 14 December, the British engaged the Americans in a short, violent battle. One longboat from &quot;Tonnant&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant James Barnwell Tattnall grappled the largest gunboat and was sunk, its boarding party transferred to the other ships&#x27; boats.

The British captured the American flotilla, comprising the tender, , and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; &quot;Tonnant&quot; had three men killed and 15 wounded, one of whom died later. then evacuated the wounded. In 1821 the survivors of the flotilla shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of the American gunboats and sundry bales of cotton. In 1847 the Admiralty issued a clasp (or bar) marked &quot;14 Dec. Boat Service 1814&quot; to survivors of the boat service who claimed the clasp to the Naval General Service Medal.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; was off New Orleans in January 1815, and in the vicinity of the attack on Fort Bowyer in February 1815. She left the anchorage off Mobile Bay on 18 February and arrived in Havana on 24 February 1815, accompanied by and .

===Post-war and fate===
&quot;Tonnant&quot; returned to England in May 1815. She then served as the flagship for Admiral Lord Keith when she took part in the exiling of Napoleon to St. Helena in 1815, though she was not part of the flotilla that took him there.

Captain John Tailour assumed command in November. From 1816 to 1817 she was the Flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell on the Cork station.

&quot;Tonnant&quot; was paid off into ordinary in November 1818. She was broken up at Plymouth in March 1821.
