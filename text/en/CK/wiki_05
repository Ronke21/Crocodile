<text>Veronica &quot;Randy&quot; Crawford (born February 18, 1952) is a retired American jazz and R&amp;B singer. She has been more successful in Europe than in the United States, where she has not entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a solo artist. However, she has appeared on the Hot 100 singles chart twice. The first time was in 1979 as a guest vocalist on the Crusaders&#x27; top-40 hit &quot;Street Life&quot;. She also dueted with Rick Springfield on the song &quot;Taxi Dancing&quot;, which hit number 59 as the B-side of Springfield&#x27;s hit &quot;Bop Til You Drop&quot;. She has had five top-20 hits in the UK, including her 1980 number-two hit, &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, as well as six UK top-10 albums. Despite her American nationality, she won Best British Female Solo Artist in recognition of her popularity in the UK at the 1982 Brit Awards. In the late 2000s, she received her first two Grammy Award nominations.

==Career==
Crawford first performed at club gigs from Cincinnati to Saint-Tropez, but made her name in the mid-1970s in New York, where she sang with jazzmen George Benson and Cannonball Adderley.
She signed with Columbia Records and released her first single, &quot;Knock On Wood&quot; / &quot;If You Say the Word&quot; in 1972. Adderley invited her to sing on his album &quot;Big Man: The Legend Of John Henry&quot; (1975). During a brief tenure at Columbia Records, Crawford recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Caught in Love&#x27;s Triangle&quot;. She is also one of the vocalists on Fred Wesley &amp; The Horny Horns&#x27; &quot;A Blow For Me, A Toot To You&quot; (1977).

In 1978, Crawford sang vocals on &quot;Hoping Love Will Last&quot;, the opening song on side two of &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch!&quot;, which was the second solo album by the former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett.

She led R&amp;B veterans The Crusaders on the transatlantic hit &quot;Street Life&quot; (1979). A specially re-recorded version was featured in the soundtrack for the films &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, and appeared in commercials in the early 2000s. She later recorded for Warner Bros. Records. Crawford was named the &#x27;Most Outstanding Performer&#x27; at the 1980 Tokyo Music Festival. Crawford also recorded the love theme (&quot;People Alone&quot;) for the film soundtrack of &quot;The Competition&quot; on MCA Records in 1980.

Her follow-up solo efforts included &quot;One Day I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; (1980) and &quot;You Might Need Somebody&quot; (1981), which became soul standards, and a cover of the Tony Joe White song, popularised by Brook Benton, &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot;. The album &quot;Secret Combination&quot; (1981) stayed on the UK Albums Chart for sixty weeks, after which her profile dipped, despite a return to the UK Top Ten with &quot;Almaz&quot; in 1986. In June 1981, Crawford also released another hit, &quot;One Hello&quot;, from the album &quot;Windsong&quot;. She continued to record for Warner Bros through the 1990s, but was unable to score either a big R&amp;B hit or major crossover success.

&quot;Naked And True&quot; (1995) brought Crawford back to her roots: it included George Benson&#x27;s &quot;Give Me the Night&quot;, and confirmed her soul heritage by featuring Funkadelic members Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell and the Fred Wesley Horns. She enjoyed her highest profile of the decade when rising starlet Shola Ama had a worldwide hit with her 1997 cover of &quot;You Might Need Somebody&quot;.

Crawford recorded a live session with Joe Sample on July 24, 2007, at Abbey Road Studios for &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot;. The episode she shared with David Gilmour and Amos Lee was screened on the Sundance Channel in the US and Channel 4 in the UK.

She has sung with Bootsy Collins, Johnny Bristol, Quincy Jones, Al Jarreau,  Rick Springfield, Katri Helena, Michael Kamen, Zucchero, David Sanborn, Steve Hackett, the Spanish band Presuntos Implicados, the Norwegian jazz-rock band Lava and Joe Sample amongst others.

Randy Crawford was set to perform &quot;The Farewell South Africa&quot; tour in Cape Town and Pretoria in October 2018 but it was cancelled due to her suffering a stroke. This would have been Crawford&#x27;s final performance prior to retiring.

<doc id="1118130" wikidata="Q5422733" url="?curid=1118130" title="Eye relief">
<text>The eye relief of an optical instrument (such as a telescope, a microscope, or binoculars) is the distance from the last surface of an eyepiece within which the user&#x27;s eye can obtain the full viewing angle. If a viewer&#x27;s eye is outside this distance, a reduced field of view will be obtained. The calculation of eye relief is complex, though generally, the higher the magnification and the larger the intended field of view, the shorter the eye relief.

==Eye relief and exit pupil==
The eye relief property should not be confused with the exit pupil width of an instrument: that is best described as the &quot;width of the cone of light&quot; that is available to the viewer at the exact &quot;eye relief&quot; distance. An exit pupil larger than the observer&#x27;s pupil wastes some light, but allows for some fumbling in side-to-side movement without vignetting or clipping. Conversely, an exit pupil smaller than the eye&#x27;s pupil will have all of its available light used, but since it cannot tolerate much side-to-side error in eye alignment, will often result in a vignetted or clipped image.

The exit pupil width of say, a binocular, can be calculated as the objective diameter divided by the magnification, and gives the width of the exit cone of light in the same dimensions as the objective. For example, a 10 × 42 binocular has a 4.2 mm wide exit cone, and fairly comfortable for general use, whereas doubling the magnification with a zoom feature to 20 × results in a much more critical 2.1 mm exit cone.
Eye relief distance can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers and shooters. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eyepiece, so that user needs a longer eye relief in order to still see the entire field of view. A simple practical test as to whether or not spectacles limit the field of view can be conducted by viewing first &quot;without&quot; spectacles and then again &quot;with&quot; them. Ideally there should be no difference in the field.

For a shooter, eye relief is also a safety consideration. If the eye relief of a telescopic sight is too short, leaving the eye close to the sight, the firearm&#x27;s recoil can force the optic&#x27;s eyepiece to hit and cut into the skin around the shooter&#x27;s eye, leaving a curved scarring laceration on the medial end of the supraorbital ridge and the eyebrow. This is frequently called a &quot;scope bite&quot;, or the &quot;idiot cut&quot;, due to the obvious and long-lasting nature of such a mistake. Typical eye relief distances for telescopic sights are often between one and four inches (25 to 100 mm), as opposed to the much shorter 15 to 17 mm for typical binoculars. The exit pupil widths in rifle sights are designed to be larger than the eye&#x27;s pupil, to allow for a range of motion without vignetting.

==Available eye relief==
The eye relief given in product specifications does not always give a realistic view of what a user can expect. Although eye-cups can usually be folded down to allow the spectacle wearer to get closer to binocular eyepieces, there are sometimes lens mountings that do not allow the theoretical eye relief to be obtained. A better measure for those with strict needs would be one that takes account of this &quot;available&quot; eye relief, the theoretical value less any thickness of the lens&#x27; rims. This point can account for confusion in performance and is rarely expressed clearly.

Additionally, when a spectacle wearer orders new glasses, the optician will ask them whether they prefer their spectacles close to the eyes or at some distance. This distance is referred to as the &quot;back vertex distance&quot;, or BVD on a prescription. Since this property affects the &quot;available eye relief&quot; of any binocular or other optics used, (telescopes, microscopes, etc.) it should be borne in mind at the eye testing stage. The matter should be discussed with the optician, though the only realistic way of testing the comfort is to try the optical device while wearing the usual spectacles. The optician can however make sure that the BVD is no worse in the new glasses than in the old ones that were used during evaluation.

==Adding prescription lenses==
In the event that a spectacle wearer cannot obtain the eye relief that they require, some cameras and microscopes allow prescription lenses to be fitted onto their eyepieces. In this way, the user can temporarily dispense with glasses in favor of the lens mounted on the optics. Although this method does not afford good incidental vision for the field around them, it might still be of use to some.</text><links>

<text>Birsa Seva Dal (BSD) is a political group in India. BSD demanded a separate Chhotanagpur state. The party had Christian influences. It was founded in 1967 by Lalit Kujur. The general secretary was Moses Guria and treasurer was Enock Wellington Sheetal.

In 1967–1969, BSD was engaged in agitation for the expulsion of non-Chhotanagpuris from the area. BSD later left their methods, but was disintegrated in conflicts. They were instrumental in fighting for the rights of the tribals for proper and legitimate compensation of their lands in village lohajimi area, which was to be displaced on account of construction of dam in the area, the project was later abandoned .

<doc id="1118134" wikidata="Q1324551" url="?curid=1118134" title="Truth and Soul">
<text>Truth and Soul is the second studio album by American rock band Fishbone. It was released on September 13, 1988. As is typical of the band&#x27;s history of music the album features a wide array of genres including punk, ska, reggae, soul, funk, and blues. Additionally, &quot;Truth and Soul&quot; includes the band&#x27;s earliest foray into hard rock and heavy metal. The album begins with a cover version of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot;, originally from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Super Fly&quot;.

==Recording==
Following the release of the &quot;Fishbone&quot; EP and &quot;In Your Face&quot;, the band had completed their original record contract with Columbia Records and renegotiated a new deal that would allow them another full-length album. It was later acknowledged as a sign of how much faith Columbia had in Fishbone at the time to continue to support their records.

Guitarist Kendall Jones was becoming concerned that the band&#x27;s image was &quot;cartoonish,&quot; and reviews of their previous album had, in fact, criticized the attempt at socially conscious subject matter alongside other absurd frat-rock songs. Meanwhile, Jones was beginning to experiment with heavy rock guitar work, which was influencing Fishbone&#x27;s new material. These elements together influenced the band to make a more serious album with a consistently socially conscious theme.

==Promotion==
Domestically, two tracks were released as singles in promotion of the album. The first, &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot;, had a music video directed by Douglas Gayeton, and the second, &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;, had a video directed by Mike Lipscombe. Additional singles were released in Europe for the songs &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;One Day.&quot; Additionally, a promotional EP titled &quot;Interchords&quot; was released with live versions of six songs from the record followed by excerpts from an interview at KUSF explaining each song&#x27;s meaning.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews of &quot;Truth and Soul&quot; were generally mixed to positive. David Silverman for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album a mixed review saying that the blend of musical styles hurts the album &quot;despite the band&#x27;s talent.&quot; In a separate review for the same newspaper, Chris Heim positively reviewed the record, especially in light of it being only the band&#x27;s sophomore effort, calling the record &quot;fresh, assured and bursting with ideas and energy [that] seem like it should come from more experienced musicians.&quot; Netherlands music magazine &quot;OOR&quot; awarded the album as the twenty-second best rock album of the year out of 154 entries.

Retrospective reviews were generally positive. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Greg Prato awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five and noted that, as Fishbone&#x27;s first significant use of hard rock, guitarist Kendall Jones&#x27; guitar-playing yielded &quot;often-spectacular results.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a B rating and said that he didn&#x27;t think the album flowed well when taken as a whole, but that each song on its own could &quot;change any radio station&#x27;s pace quite satisfactorily.&quot; Additionally, the album was awarded four-out-of-five stars in 2004&#x27;s &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;. Music critic Tom Moon called the album one of his &quot;1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; and Robert Dimery listed it as one of his &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Track listing==
European CD version comes with a slightly different track listing order as tracks 3 (Question of Life) and 6 (Mighty Long Way) are inverted. Outside of Europe, the album contained only twelve tracks, with &quot;I Like to Hide Behind My Glasses&quot; and &quot;In the Name of Swing&quot; not included. These two tracks from the European CD version would later be released in the US on the EP &quot;Set the Booty Up Right&quot;.

<text>Elaeagnus () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeagnaceae. Some species of the genus are commonly known as silverberry or oleaster, 

== Description ==
&quot;Elaeagnus&quot; plants are deciduous or evergreen shrubs or small trees. The alternate leaves and the shoots are usually covered with tiny silvery to brownish scales, giving the plants a whitish to grey-brown colour from a distance. The flowers are small, with a four-lobed calyx and no petals; they are often fragrant. The fruit is a fleshy drupe containing a single seed; it is edible in many species. Several species are cultivated for their fruit, including &quot;E. angustifolia&quot;, &quot;E. umbellata&quot;, and &quot;E. multiflora&quot; (gumi). &quot;E. umbellata&quot; contains the carotenoid lycopene.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; was erected in 1754 by Carl Linnaeus, who attributed the name to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. There is agreement that the name is based on Theophrastus&#x27;s use of the Ancient Greek (, latinized to ) as the name of a shrub. The first part of the name, &quot;elae-&quot;, is from , &#x27;olive&#x27;. Sources differ on the origin of the second part: it may be from , &quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot;, the chaste tree, or from the Greek name for a kind of willow. In either case, the second part is derived from (), meaning &#x27;pure&#x27;, &#x27;chaste&#x27;.

* &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;maritima&quot; 
* &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;reflexa&quot; (&quot;E. pungens&quot; × &quot;E. glabra&quot;)
* &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;submacrophylla&quot; (&quot;E. macrophylla&quot; × &quot;E. pungens&quot;)

== Habitat ==
The vast majority of the species are native to temperate and subtropical regions of Asia. &quot;Elaeagnus triflora&quot; extends from Asia south into northeastern Australia, while &quot;E. commutata&quot; is native to North America, and &quot;Elaeagnus philippinensis&quot; is native to the Philippines. One of the Asian species, &quot;E. angustifolia,&quot; may also be native in southeasternmost Europe, though it may instead be an early human introduction there. Also, several Asiatic species of &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; have become established as introduced species in North America, with some of these species being considered invasive, or even designated as noxious, in portions of the United States.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Elaeagnus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora elaeagnisella&quot; and the Gothic moths. The thorny shrubs can also provide good nesting sites for birds.

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
Many &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; species harbor nitrogen-fixing organisms in their roots, so are able to grow well in low-nitrogen soils. This ability results in multiple ecological consequences where these &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; species are present. They can become invasive in many locations where they are established as exotic species. Two species (&quot;E. pungens&quot; and &quot;E. umbellata&quot;) are currently rated as category II noxious, invasive species in many world regions and by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Elaeagnus&quot; species are widely cultivated for their showy, often variegated, foliage, and numerous cultivars and hybrids have been developed.

The fruit is acidic and somewhat astringent. It makes good tarts.
Notable species and hybrids in cultivation include:-
*&quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus commutata&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus macrophylla&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus multiflora&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus pungens&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;reflexa&quot;
*&quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;submacrophylla&quot; (syn. &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;ebbingei&quot;)
*&quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot;

The hybrid &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; × &quot;submacrophylla&quot; and the cultivar &#x27;Gilt Edge&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="1118139" wikidata="Q6602902" url="?curid=1118139" title="List of 2004 United States presidential electors">
<text>This is a list of electors (members of the Electoral College) who cast ballots to elect the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 2004 presidential election. There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. While every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector&#x27;s residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district.

<text>Russell Churney (10 September 1964 – 27 February 2007) was an English composer, pianist, arranger and musical director, and a member of the comedy/cabaret group, Fascinating Aïda. Ooberman keyboardist and vocalist Sophia Churney is his sister.

==Biography==
Born as Lindsay Russell Churney in Liverpool, Churney was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Great Crosby and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied Law.

He spent seven years working with the comedian Julian Clary, touring extensively with Clary and singer Barb Jungr, and appearing with Jungr on Clary&#x27;s Channel 4 TV series &quot;Sticky Moments with Julian Clary&quot;. Together with Jungr, he devised and performed in shows including &quot;Bare&quot;, &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, &quot;Songs From The Heart&quot;, &quot;Chanson: The Space in Between&quot;, &quot;Barb, Bob and Brel&quot;, and the musical &quot;The Ballad of Norah&#x27;s Ark&quot;.

He recorded the album &quot;Durga Rising&quot; (1997) with Jungr and percussionist Kuljit Bhamra, and he performs on Jungr&#x27;s albums &quot;Bare&quot; (1999), &quot;&quot; (2000), and &quot;Every Grain of Sand: Barb Jungr Sings Bob Dylan&quot; (2002).

With Des de Moor (like Jungr, a chansonnier, or singer of chansons), he devised and performed in &quot;Darkness and Disgrace: Travels with a Wild-Eyed Alien from Bromley&quot;, a show directed by Jungr and based around songs by David Bowie. Churney and de Moor also recorded an accompanying album &quot;Darkness and Disgrace: Des de Moor and Russell Churney Perform the Songs of David Bowie&quot; (2003), featuring Jungr.

Other musical shows on which Churney worked as musical director and pianist include &quot;Portraits in Song&quot; (with Elizabeth Mansfield),
&quot;The Lonely Fate of the Femme Fatale&quot; (with Sandra Lawrence),
&quot;Back With You&quot; (with Dillie Keane), &quot;Cabaret Whores&quot; (with Howard Samuels), &quot;Straker Sings Brel&quot; (with Peter Straker),
and &quot;Big Night Out at the Little Palace Theatre&quot; (with Sandi Toksvig and Dillie Keane).

He also recorded the albums &quot;One Last Flutter&quot; with Fascinating Aida and &quot;Back With You&quot; with Dillie Keane. He composed original scores for films including &quot;One Minute Past Midnight&quot; (directed by Celia Galan Julve, 2004) and the Channel 4 documentaries &quot;Return Trip&quot; (dir Carol Morley) and &quot;The Alcohol Years&quot; (directed by Carol Morley, 2000).
Churney died of pancreatic cancer, aged 42. A memorial concert, &quot;The Lovely Russell&quot;, was held in his honour on 29 June 2008, with performances by his friends or associates Barb Jungr, Sandi Toksvig, Fascinating Aïda, Julian Clary and many others. Sylvester McCoy donated one of his prop hats from his character in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The proceeds of the concert went to Russell&#x27;s favourite charities.

<text>Sete Cidades is a civil parish in the center of the municipality of Ponta Delgada, that is likewise located in the center of a massive volcanic crater across, also referred to as Sete Cidades. The population in 2011 was 793, in an area of 19.19 km2. It is one of the smallest parishes of Ponta Delgada by population, although the largest in area. It contains the localities Cerrado da Ladeira, Cerrado das Freiras and Sete Cidades.

==History==
===Latin origins===
The region received its geographic nomenclature from the Latin Insula Septem Civitatum, which means Island of the Seven Tribes or Island of the Seven Peoples (Portuguese: &quot;Ilha das Sete Tribos&quot; or &quot;Ilha dos Sete Povos&quot;), but became a historical reference as the Island of the Seven Cities. This comes from classical Latin, probably incorporated into the older traditions of Mediterranean peoples, through the navigators of European antiquity, or the Phoenicians. In Latin, &quot;civitas&quot; does not signify &quot;city&quot;, but rather a collectivity of citizens of a determined community.

The first Iberian document to refer to Sete Cidades was a Latin chronicle from the city of Porto-Cale (the modern city of Oporto), written in 750 A.D. by a Christian cleric. During this era, the Iberian Kingdom of the Visigoths was in the process of collapse, under pressure from Muslim invasions (which began in 711 A.D.). The Visigoth archbishop fled to Porto-Cale, fearing the assault of the Muslim forces, where he deliberated an escape to the lands in the Western Sea, which sailors insisted existed. In 734, the archbishop, accompanied by six other bishops, their prelates and approximately 5000 faithful, sailed away in a fleet of twenty ships. The chronicle indicated that the fleet arrived at their destination, burned their ships and established seven Christian communities under the reign of the seven religious leaders. Although many prepared to follow, in truth, the archbishop (if he existed) was never heard from again, nor was the route to the mythical lands established.

Although there is no proof that the &quot;island of Seven Cities&quot; actually existed, the belief of their existence, some tentative expeditions and brief unconfirmed visual sightings of Atlantic islands, fostered legends during the European Middle Ages. Consequently, many of the Medieval maps and charts that showed the Ocean Sea (the Atlantic Ocean) identified an island (or islands) represented in different positions or forms. The island of Brasil and/or Antillia (from the Brendan context) and the island of Sete Cidades, were usual geographic references that persisted in the proto-geography of the Atlantic.

With the advent of the Age of Discovery, the visual references and number of voyages of discovery multiplied. One of the more consistent maps presented to King Afonso V of Portugal was from the Azorean, Fernão Teles (in 1473). This map showed a long coastline, with various islands, bays and rivers which the author declared were part of the fabled land of Sete Cidades. In reality, the map easily follows the northern coast of Brazil, between Maranhão and Ceará, with the Rio Parnaíba delta. The King, himself, was not totally convinced of the discovery, or did not consider Fernão Teles sufficiently creditable, and that the map only represented a reference that required proofs. Unhappy with the outcome, Teles insisted on the validity of Sete Cidades. He consulted a Genovese cosmographer Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli (1398–1492), who declared that Antilla and the island of Sete Cidades existed along the margins of the Atlantic. In his famous letter, Toscanelli placed the mythical lands of Sete Cidades near the Azores:

:&quot;The island of Antillia was discovered by the Portuguese, and now when it is sought it is not found. In this island are people who speak the Spanish tongue, and who in the time of King Roderick are believed to have fled to this island from the barbarians who at the time invaded Spain. Here dwelt an archbishop with six other bishops, each of whom had its own particular city. Wherefore this island is called by many &#x27;seven cities.&#x27; These people live most piously in the full enjoyment of all the riches of this time.&quot;

In 1476, the Teles&#x27;s petition of royal authentication was accepted, but no expeditions were sent by the donatario.

Of the better documented expeditions, the Fleming Ferdinand van Olm (also known in Azorean history as Fernando de Ulmo or Fernão Dulmo) captained an expedition to rediscover the lost kingdoms of Sete Cidades. Ironically, Fernando de Ulmo was then married to one of the daughters of Fernão Teles and lived on one of the islands of the Azores when, in 1486, he received authorization from King João II of Portugal to begin his expedition. In partnership with Afonso do Estreito, a Madeirense, he organized his voyage, with the co-financing of the Royal Court, in order to conquer and subjugate the islands. Unfortunately, Fernão Dulmo did not have better luck, but ultimately, around the 17th Century, did organize an expedition to the northwest of Terceira, where an unknown island had been spotted.

===Settlement===
The colonization of Sete Cidades developed after the property owner, José Bettencourt, who was the principal benefactor of the lands within the crater, made tracts available for settlement. These lands were rented to farmers and other colleagues, who then cultivated the limited tracts and paid monthly stipends for their use. For a long time, this limited the number of inhabitants living within the caldera.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

The Sete Cidades volcano is situated on the extreme western portion of the island of São Miguel occupying an area of approximately and refers to a polygenetic volcano (&quot;Sete Cidades Massif&quot;) and caldera. Its subaerial volume, of about , has grown at an estimated rate of per century, beginning more than 210,000 years ago. Presently, the interior of the structure is occupied by diverse volcanic structures and four lakes. It is almost circular caldera ( in diameter and up to high walls) formed through three phases of eruptions. The last intra-calderan eruption occurred approximately 500 years A.D., resulting in the creation of the &quot;Caldeira Seca&quot; cone. At the base of the caldera, there exist six Holocene era pyroclastic cones. Further, a large group of pleistocene post-caldera trachytic lava domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic flow deposits have been discovered on the northwestern flanks of the massif.

The two crater lakes (), within the crater, are referred to by the color of the waters: blue, reflecting the sky () and green, reflecting the ground (). According to legend, the differently colored lakes were created when a princess and her lover, a young shepherd, had to part from each other. The tears they shed at their farewell became the two lakes, with the water colored like their eyes.

===Human geography===
The urbanized portion of the parish, the village of Sete Cidades, is located in the southwest portion of the crater within the &quot;Cumierias da Bretanha&quot; and extends from the &quot;Blue Lake&quot; north to south. Farmland, mostly pastures, are located around the village, and confined to the portions south of the &quot;Blue Lake&quot;. The remainder of the crater is forested, although the southeastern portion also has some grasslands. A bridge at the junction of the two lakes provides the most direct road connection to Ponta Delgada. In the western end of the crater, in an area of open parklands, a 1.2 km tunnel containing water pipes and a footpath links the crater to the village of Mosteiros.

==Architecture==

* Church of São Nicolau (), the revivalist Neo-Gothic church is oriented around a single-nave, rectangular plan consisting of a sacristy, chancel and annexes, with differentiated covering and illuminated by lateral Gothic windows. The main facada includes a single, central belltower, with doorway and windows (also Gothic). The interior includes baptistery, triumphal arch and simple altar.

<text>In the Whyte notation, a 6-2-0 is a railroad steam locomotive that has an unpowered three-axle leading truck followed by a single powered driving axle. This wheel arrangement is associated with the Crampton locomotive type, and in the USA the single class were sometimes referred to as Cramptons.

Other equivalent classifications are:
UIC classification: 3A (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
French classification: 310
Turkish classification: 14
Swiss classification: 1/4

==History==
The 6-2-0 was a most unusual wheel arrangement, where the bulk of the locomotive&#x27;s weight was on the unpowered leading wheels rather than the powered driving wheels, therefore giving poor adhesion. The type was only practicable on the Crampton locomotive with a low boiler and large driving wheels placed behind the firebox.

==United Kingdom==
The only British 6-2-0 was the locomotive &quot;Liverpool&quot; built in 1848 by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy for the London and North Western Railway. It was exhibited at The Great Exhibition in 1851 but was only moderately successful and no more were built.

==United States==
On a trip to England, Robert L. Stevens, president of the Camden and Amboy (C&amp;A) railroad, saw 6-2-0 demonstrations on the railways there. When he returned in 1848, Stevens asked his master mechanic Isaac Dripps to build him a 6-2-0 for use on the C&amp;A. The specifications for the first 6-2-0 included a 38&quot; diameter boiler that would burn anthracite coal and 96&quot; diameter driving wheels.

Designing the locomotive type to burn coal, which was still fairly expensive and difficult to come by, was unusual for the time. The great majority of locomotives of the 1830s and 1840s were built to burn wood, which was very plentiful, cheap and exceptionally easy to obtain along the railroad rights of way. Besides being more expensive, coal required a larger firebox in which to burn. Dripps rose to the challenge and created an operable design.

The first of three locomotives based on these specifications, named &quot;John Stevens&quot;, was completed in 1849. Dripps wasn&#x27;t too sure that the locomotive would prove effective on American railroads, and his reservations turned out to be correct. The locomotive&#x27;s tractive effort was not sufficient for long term or heavy work. With only one driving axle and three unpowered leading axles, too much of the locomotive&#x27;s weight was distributed over the unpowered lead three axles. Almost a century passed before a six-wheel leading truck was used again, on the PRR S1 and S2.

The C&amp;A&#x27;s management, on the other hand, thought it performed admirably enough to order two more of them and place them in passenger service. It was claimed that they could reach 60 m.p.h. at a time when fast trains reached only 40 m.p.h. The 6-2-0s were later rebuilt to 4-4-0s and were in use as late as 1865.

<doc id="1118155" wikidata="Q254245" url="?curid=1118155" title="Colen Campbell">
<text>Colen Campbell (15 June 1676 – 13 September 1729) was a pioneering Scottish architect and architectural writer who played an important part in the development of the Georgian style. For most of his career, he resided in Italy and England. As well as his architectural designs, he is known for Vitruvius Britannicus, three volumes of high-quality engravings showing the great houses of the time.

== Early life ==
A descendant of the Campbells of Cawdor Castle, he is believed to be the Colinus Campbell who graduated from the University of Edinburgh in July 1695. He initially trained as a lawyer, being admitted to the Faculty of Advocates on 29 July 1702.

He travelled in Italy between 1695 and 1702, and is believed to be the Colinus Campbell who signed the visitor&#x27;s book at the University of Padua in 1697. He is believed to have trained in and studied architecture under James Smith, a belief strengthened by Campbell owning several drawings of buildings designed by Smith.

==&quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;==
His major published work, &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus, or the British Architect...&quot; appeared in three volumes between 1715 and 1725. This was the first architectural work to originate in England since John Shute&#x27;s Elizabethan &quot;First Groundes.&quot; In the empirical vein, it was not a treatise but basically a catalogue of design, containing engravings of English buildings by Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren, as well as Campbell himself and other prominent architects of the era.

In the introduction that he appended and in the brief descriptions, Campbell belaboured the &quot;excesses&quot; of Baroque style and declared British independence from foreigners while he dedicated the volume to Hanoverian George I. The third volume (1725) has several grand layouts of gardens and parks, with straight allées, for courts and patterned parterres and radiating rides through wooded plantations, in a Baroque manner that was rapidly becoming old-fashioned.

Buildings were shown in plan, section and elevation, and some in a bird&#x27;s-eye perspective. The drawings and designs contained in the book were under way before Campbell was drawn into the speculative scheme. The success of the volumes was instrumental in popularising neo-Palladian architecture in Great Britain and America during the 18th century. For example, Plate 16 of &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, a rendering of Somerset House in London, was an inspiration for American architect Peter Harrison when he designed the Brick Market in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1761.

Campbell was influenced as a young man by James Smith (c. 1645–1731), the pre-eminent Scots architect of his day, and an early neo-Palladian whom Campbell called &quot;the most experienced architect&quot; of Scotland (&quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, ii).

The somewhat promotional volume, with its excellently rendered engravings, came at a propitious moment at the beginning of a boom in country house and villa building among the Whig oligarchy. Campbell was quickly taken up by Lord Burlington, who replaced James Gibbs with Campbell at Burlington House in London and set out to place himself at the centre of English neo-Palladian architecture. In 1718, Campbell was appointed deputy to the amateur gentleman who had replaced Wren as Surveyor General of the Royal Board of Works, an appointment that Burlington is certain to have pressed, but a short-lived one. When Benson, the new Surveyor was turned out of office, Campbell went with him.

=== Later volumes ===
There are later volumes also published under the name ‘Vitruvius Brittanicus’, but they are not connected to Colen Campbell&#x27;s work. In 1739 a volume was issued by Badeslade and Rocque, described as ‘Volume 4’. However, this had little in common with Campbell, comprising mainly topographical perspective views of houses (54 plates). Between 1765 and 1771, Woolfe and Gandon published their ‘Volumes 4 &amp; 5’ (79 and 75 plates). They discounted Badeslade&#x27;s volume, believing their work to be a more correct continuation of Campbell, hence their numbering. The plates are indeed mostly plans and elevations of buildings largely in the Palladian style, most dating from after 1750. The various Volumes are fully described in Harris.

==Campbell&#x27;s main commissions==

* Wanstead House, Essex, c. 1713/4–20 (&quot;illustrated left&quot;). In the first volume of &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, the most influential designs were two alternatives for a palatial Wanstead House, Essex, for the merchant-banker Sir Richard Child, of which the second design was already under way when the volume was published. (Campbell claimed that Wanstead House had Great Britain&#x27;s first classical portico, but this accolade probably belongs to The Vyne, Hampshire.)
* Burlington House, London, 1717. Remodelled the front and provided an entrance gateway for Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (Remodelled in 1868 and the gateway demolished.)
* Stourhead, Wiltshire, 1721–24, as a seat for the London-based banker Henry Hoare. Wings were added in the later 18th century, and Campbell&#x27;s portico was not executed (though to his design) until 1841. The famous landscape garden round a lake, somewhat apart from the house, was developed after Campbell&#x27;s death, by Henry Flitcroft.

* Pembroke House, Whitehall, London, for Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke, 1723, a London house in a prominent location for the heir of Jones&#x27; Wilton House. It was rebuilt in 1757 and demolished in 1913. Lord Herbert (as he then was) was inspired by it to design the similar Marble Hill at Twickenham for Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, the mistress of the future George II. (Marble Hill was a 5-bay palladian villa with central pediment, raised on a high basement, with clumped screens of trees and formal turfed terraces descending to the Thames, &quot;illustrated right&quot;, that manifest the earliest stages of the English landscape garden.)
* Houghton Hall, Norfolk, begun 1722, for Sir Robert Walpole, the Whig prime minister. Here Campbell was replaced by Gibbs, who capped the end pavilions with octagonal domes, and by William Kent, who designed the interiors.

<text>José Antonio Aguirre y Lecube (6 March 1904 – 22 March 1960) was a Basque politician and activist in the Basque Nationalist Party. He was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Basque Country and the executive defense advisor during the Spanish Civil War. Under his mandate, the Provisional Government formed the Basque Army and fought for the Second Spanish Republic.

==Early life==
José Antonio Aguirre was born in Bilbao, Biscay, Spain. He studied in the Basque Country&#x27;s first Ikastola, a school in which all lessons were given in Basque. He later studied law at the University of Deusto.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1920, Aguirre moved with his family to Algorta, near Bilbao. At 16 years of age, he had to become a father figure to his 10 younger brothers and sisters.

After finishing his law studies, he began working in the family business, Chocolates Aguirre. He later took responsibility for the business and introduced many reforms, including free health care and paid holidays, which significantly improved conditions for the workers in the factory. He also donated part of the business&#x27;s revenue to the poor and advocated for social housing. Until 1937, Chocolates Bilbaínos S.A. was the second-largest business in its sector in Spain.

Aguirre was a football player for Athletic Bilbao; he won the Copa del Rey with the club in 1923. During the Spanish Civil War, he was one of the main promoters of the Basque Country national football team, which played in Europe and the Americas to raise funds for Basque refugee children whose parents had been forced into exile.

In 1926, after completing his military service, he began work as an attorney at Esteban Bilbao&#x27;s office. Soon after, he founded his own firm, which focused on political issues and the working conditions of the lower class.

At the time, Spain was ruled by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. Aguirre, a Basque nationalist, joined the Basque Nationalist Party. The party was later divided into two political streams. Aguirre opposed the division, believing that the Basque Country was above any differences. He worked to unify the two factions and succeeded in 1930.

Aguirre increased his involvement in politics and published articles in the newspapers &quot;Euzko Gaztedia&quot; and &quot;Euzkadi&quot;. As an example of his integrationist views and new ideals, in 1932, he proposed that the party should accept people who were not born in the Basque Country.

==Early political career==

After the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ended in 1930, a new political era began in Spain. In 1931 and 1932, Aguirre intervened decisively in failed attempts at Basque devolution, which called for self-government, including in Navarre.

On 5 November 1933, two weeks before a general election, a referendum was held in Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay on new wording for the Statute of Devolution, which abandoned the inclusion of Navarre. The wording was approved by an overwhelming majority (459,000 votes in favour, 14,000 against), but in Álava, the votes in favour did not reach 50%.

As a result of the dissolution of the legislature for the general election, the hesitation of radical government, and Carlist opposition to the incorporation of Álava in the statutory process, devolution was prevented until 1 October 1936, when the Spanish Civil War started.

==Spanish Civil War==
On 7 October, the councillors from Biscay, along with some from Gipuzkoa and Araba, participated in passing a ballot. A major uprising had occurred in Araba and Navarre, and most of Gipuzkoa was in the hands of the rebels, who, with the political machinations of the councillors, set the stage for major political change. Agirre was elected Lehendakari (basque president). After a religious ceremony at the Basilica of Begoña in which he swore allegiance to Catholicism, his country and his party, he visited Gernika and took his oath of office in the Basque language:

A government of conciliation was formed by Basque Nationalists, Socialists, Communists, and other Republicans but not without tensions among them. The government was in power in Biscay for several months until the fall of Bilbao.

The first Basque Government was made up of four members of the Basque Nationalist Party (Agirre as Lehendakari and head of defense, Jesús María Leizaola as head of justice and culture, Eliodoro de la Torre as head of finance, and Telesforo Monzón as head of interior); three of the PSOE (Santiago Aznar as head of industry, Juan Gracia Colás as head of welfare, and Juan de los Toyos as head of labor); one of Basque Nationalist Action (Gonzalo Nárdiz as head of agriculture); one of the Republican Left (Ramón María Aldasoro Galarza as head of trade); one of the Republican Union (Alfredo Espinosa as head of health); and one of the Spanish Communist Party (Juan Astigarrabía as head of public works).

The Basque Army (Basque: &quot;Eusko Gudarostea&quot;), with 100,000 soldiers, was made up of battalions of different ideologies. It was well armed but poorly trained, and one of its most acute deficiencies was the absence of heavy artillery and an air force. Agirre begged Indalecio Prieto and Manuel Azaña to send some aircraft. Historians agree that it was not a viable option because of the difficulties in breaking the Siege of Biscay. However, 40 to 50 airplanes were sent in different shipments, most flying over enemy territory. Others were sent across France and, after being disarmed, were retained or returned to Barcelona or Valencia in accordance with a &quot;no intervention&quot; policy. Another factor that contributed decisively to the Basque Army&#x27;s defeat was its lack of a qualified general staff.

In June 1937, the Franco&#x27;s Nationalists broke through the Iron Ring of Bilbao and entered the city as a result of the treachery of Alejandro Goikoetxea, the engineer who had designed the fortifications. Agirre moved his government to Trucíos before he headed to Santander and finally to Catalonia, where he prepared to continue fighting with his men. In May, Agirre had entered into talks with the Italians, through intermediaries, about a possible surrender. The talks continued, with the leader of the Basque Nationalist Party, Juan de Ajuriaguerra, discussing terms, the Santoña Agreement, to allow a withdrawal from Bilbao if Nationalist troops did not attack the city. However, they attacked, and Agirre refused to sign the surrender agreement and fought on.

==Exile==

Aguirre fled the country after the war and was pursued for years by agents of Francisco Franco. His exile took him to Paris, Berlin and New York City. In June 1940, the Breton Yann Fouéré gave him documents that allowed him to escape France, which had been invaded by the Wehrmacht.

Aguirre fled first to France, where he organised camps and services for Basque refugees and the government-in-exile. Caught behind enemy lines, he was in Belgium when Hitler occupied that country. He then fled to Berlin, where he lived underground until a false identity was arranged.

Under the protection of a Panaman ambassador (Germán Guardia, who provided him with a Panamanian passport), Aguirre reached Sweden. Dodging SS German intelligence, he arrived in Rio de Janeiro on the ship Vasaholm on 27 August 1941. The Brazilian customs authorities registered a Panamanian, Dr. José Álvarez Lastra, and a Venezuelan, María de Arrigorriaga, accompanied by their children, José and Gloria. They were actually Aguirre; his wife, María Zabala; and their sons, Aintzane and Joseba. Despite intense efforts made by Manuel de Ynchausti in the United States, Aguirre&#x27;s true identity was in danger of being discovered within a month.

He wrote then to Ramón María de Aldasoro, the former trade and business secretary of the Basque government, who led the Euzkadi delegation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. However, Aldasoro&#x27;s efforts on Aguirre&#x27;s behalf were unsuccessful because the Argentine authorities sympathized with the European &quot;New Order&quot;.

Aguirre went to Uruguay and asked a small group of Basque patriots for what Argentina had denied him. The Uruguayan president, General Alfredo Baldomir, agreed, and he even received Aguirre with honours in accordance with his status. Once the arrangements were complete, the public announcement of his arrival was made on 8 October in the newspapers of Montevideo. Aguirre&#x27;s identity was reinstated, and he was given a visa to travel to New York, where he was put under the protection of resident Basques, who were leading movements in Mexico and New York.

In New York, Aguirre took up a post as a lecturer at Columbia University. After the Pact of Madrid between the US and Spain, he went to France, where the Basque government-in-exile was established. There, he found that France&#x27;s Vichy government had sequestrated the Basque government building and that President Charles de Gaulle was maintaining it on behalf of Francoist Spain. The building is now the Instituto Cervantes.

The president of the government-in-exile was always a Basque Nationalist Party member, and even the Spanish sole representative in the United Nations was a Basque appointee, Jesús de Galíndez, until his murder in an obscure episode at the time of Spain&#x27;s entry to the United Nations. Aguirre decided to place the large Basque exiles&#x27; network at the service of the Allies, and collaborated with the US Secretary of State and the CIA to defeat their common enemies.

Aguirre died in Paris on 22 March 1960 from a heart attack, aged 56. His body was shipped from Paris to Saint-Jean-de-Luz in the French Basque Country, where it spent a night in the Monzón house and was buried on 28 March after a funeral Mass at the Saint-Jean parish church.

==Influence==
Aguirre&#x27;s life was the subject of a Soule folk play, &quot;Aguirre presidenta&quot; (&quot;President Aguirre&quot;). He wrote a book about his experiences, &quot;Escape Via Berlin: Eluding Franco in Hitler&#x27;s Europe&quot; (New York, 1942).

<text>The Democratic Youth Organisation of Afghanistan (, &quot;Sâzmân-e Damukrâtik-e Javânân-e Afghânistân&quot;), also known as the People&#x27;s Youth Organisation of Afghanistan, was the main youth organisation in the former Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. It was the youth wing of the ruling People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). Upon turning seventeen years of age, members of the DYOA would become eligible for membership in the PDPA. By June 1978 the organisation had around 4,000 members.

In the mid-1980s it had around 25,000 members. The DYOA was a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

<doc id="1118171" wikidata="Q2078326" url="?curid=1118171" title="Flatness problem">
<text>The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is a cosmological fine-tuning problem within the Big Bang model of the universe. Such problems arise from the observation that some of the initial conditions of the universe appear to be fine-tuned to very &#x27;special&#x27; values, and that small deviations from these values would have extreme effects on the appearance of the universe at the current time.

In the case of the flatness problem, the parameter which appears fine-tuned is the density of matter and energy in the universe. This value affects the curvature of space-time, with a very specific critical value being required for a flat universe. The current density of the universe is observed to be very close to this critical value. Since any departure of the total density from the critical value would increase rapidly over cosmic time, the early universe must have had a density even closer to the critical density, departing from it by one part in 1062 or less. This leads cosmologists to question how the initial density came to be so closely fine-tuned to this &#x27;special&#x27; value.

The problem was first mentioned by Robert Dicke in 1969. The most commonly accepted solution among cosmologists is cosmic inflation, the idea that the universe went through a brief period of extremely rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang; along with the monopole problem and the horizon problem, the flatness problem is one of the three primary motivations for inflationary theory.

==Energy density and the Friedmann equation==
According to Einstein&#x27;s field equations of general relativity, the structure of spacetime is affected by the presence of matter and energy. On small scales space appears flat – as does the surface of the Earth if one looks at a small area. On large scales however, space is bent by the gravitational effect of matter. Since relativity indicates that matter and energy are equivalent, this effect is also produced by the presence of energy (such as light and other electromagnetic radiation) in addition to matter. The amount of bending (or curvature) of the universe depends on the density of matter/energy present.

This relationship can be expressed by the first Friedmann equation. In a universe without a cosmological constant, this is:

:formula_1

Here formula_2 is the Hubble parameter, a measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding. formula_3 is the total density of mass and energy in the universe, formula_4 is the scale factor (essentially the &#x27;size&#x27; of the universe), and formula_5 is the curvature parameter — that is, a measure of how curved spacetime is. A positive, zero or negative value of formula_5 corresponds to a respectively closed, flat or open universe. The constants formula_7 and formula_8 are Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant and the speed of light, respectively.

Cosmologists often simplify this equation by defining a critical density, formula_9. For a given value of formula_2, this is defined as the density required for a flat universe, i.e. . Thus the above equation implies

:formula_11.

Since the constant formula_7 is known and the expansion rate formula_2 can be measured by observing the speed at which distant galaxies are receding from us,
formula_9 can be determined. Its value is currently around . The ratio of the actual density to this critical value is called Ω, and its difference from 1 determines the geometry of the universe: corresponds to a greater than critical density, , and hence a closed universe. gives a low density open universe, and Ω equal to exactly 1 gives a flat universe.

The Friedmann equation,

:formula_15

can be re-arranged into

:formula_16

which after factoring formula_17, and using formula_18, leads to

:formula_19

The right hand side of the last expression above contains constants only and therefore the left hand side must remain constant throughout the evolution of the universe.

As the universe expands the scale factor formula_4 increases, but the density formula_3 decreases as matter (or energy) becomes spread out. For the standard model of the universe which contains mainly matter and radiation for most of its history, formula_3 decreases more quickly than formula_23 increases, and so the factor will decrease. Since the time of the Planck era, shortly after the Big Bang, this term has decreased by a factor of around formula_24 and so must have increased by a similar amount to retain the constant value of their product.

==Current value of Ω==
===Measurement===
The value of Ω at the present time is denoted Ω0. This value can be deduced by measuring the curvature of spacetime (since , or formula_25, is defined as the density for which the curvature ). The curvature can be inferred from a number of observations.

One such observation is that of anisotropies (that is, variations with direction - see below) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is electromagnetic radiation which fills the universe, left over from an early stage in its history when it was filled with photons and a hot, dense plasma. This plasma cooled as the universe expanded, and when it cooled enough to form stable atoms it no longer absorbed the photons. The photons present at that stage have been propagating ever since, growing fainter and less energetic as they spread through the ever-expanding universe.

The temperature of this radiation is almost the same at all points on the sky, but there is a slight variation (around one part in 100,000) between the temperature received from different directions. The angular scale of these fluctuations - the typical angle between a hot patch and a cold patch on the sky - depends on the curvature of the universe which in turn depends on its density as described above. Thus, measurements of this angular scale allow an estimation of Ω0.

Another probe of Ω0 is the frequency of Type-Ia supernovae at different distances from Earth. These supernovae, the explosions of degenerate white dwarf stars, are a type of standard candle; this means that the processes governing their intrinsic brightness are well understood so that a measure of &quot;apparent&quot; brightness when seen from Earth can be used to derive accurate distance measures for them (the apparent brightness decreasing in proportion to the square of the distance - see luminosity distance). Comparing this distance to the redshift of the supernovae gives a measure of the rate at which the universe has been expanding at different points in history. Since the expansion rate evolves differently over time in cosmologies with different total densities, Ω0 can be inferred from the supernovae data.

Data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP, measuring CMB anisotropies) combined with that from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and observations of type-Ia supernovae constrain Ω0 to be 1 within 1%. In other words, the term |Ω − 1| is currently less than 0.01, and therefore must have been less than 10−62 at the Planck era. The cosmological parameters measured by Planck spacecraft mission reaffirmed previous results by WMAP.

===Implication===
This tiny value is the crux of the flatness problem. If the initial density of the universe could take any value, it would seem extremely surprising to find it so &#x27;finely tuned&#x27; to the critical value formula_9. Indeed, a very small departure of Ω from 1 in the early universe would have been magnified during billions of years of expansion to create a current density very far from critical. In the case of an overdensity this would lead to a universe so dense it would cease expanding and collapse into a Big Crunch (an opposite to the Big Bang in which all matter and energy falls back into an extremely dense state) in a few years or less; in the case of an underdensity it would expand so quickly and become so sparse it would soon seem essentially empty, and gravity would not be strong enough by comparison to cause matter to collapse and form galaxies resulting in a big freeze. In either case the universe would contain no complex structures such as galaxies, stars, planets and any form of life.

This problem with the Big Bang model was first pointed out by Robert Dicke in 1969, and it motivated a search for some reason the density should take such a specific value.

==Solutions to the problem==
Some cosmologists agreed with Dicke that the flatness problem was a serious one, in need of a fundamental reason for the closeness of the density to criticality. But there was also a school of thought which denied that there was a problem to solve, arguing instead that since the universe must have some density it may as well have one close to formula_27 as far from it, and that speculating on a reason for any particular value was &quot;beyond the domain of science&quot;. That, however, is a minority viewpoint, even among those sceptical of the existence of the flatness problem. Several cosmologists have argued that, for a variety of reasons, the flatness problem is based on a misunderstanding.

===Anthropic principle===

One solution to the problem is to invoke the anthropic principle, which states that humans should take into account the conditions necessary for them to exist when speculating about causes of the universe&#x27;s properties. If two types of universe seem equally likely but only one is suitable for the evolution of intelligent life, the anthropic principle suggests that finding ourselves in that universe is no surprise: if the other universe had existed instead, there would be no observers to notice the fact.

The principle can be applied to solve the flatness problem in two somewhat different ways. The first (an application of the &#x27;strong anthropic principle&#x27;) was suggested by C. B. Collins and Stephen Hawking, who in 1973 considered the existence of an infinite number of universes such that every possible combination of initial properties was held by some universe. In such a situation, they argued, only those universes with exactly the correct density for forming galaxies and stars would give rise to intelligent observers such as humans: therefore, the fact that we observe Ω to be so close to 1 would be &quot;simply a reflection of our own existence&quot;.

An alternative approach, which makes use of the &#x27;weak anthropic principle&#x27;, is to suppose that the universe is infinite in size, but with the density varying in different places (i.e. an inhomogeneous universe). Thus some regions will be over-dense and some under-dense . These regions may be extremely far apart - perhaps so far that light has not had time to travel from one to another during the age of the universe (that is, they lie outside one another&#x27;s cosmological horizons). Therefore, each region would behave essentially as a separate universe: if we happened to live in a large patch of almost-critical density we would have no way of knowing of the existence of far-off under- or over-dense patches since no light or other signal has reached us from them. An appeal to the anthropic principle can then be made, arguing that intelligent life would only arise in those patches with Ω very close to 1, and that therefore our living in such a patch is unsurprising.

This latter argument makes use of a version of the anthropic principle which is &#x27;weaker&#x27; in the sense that it requires no speculation on multiple universes, or on the probabilities of various different universes existing instead of the current one. It requires only a single universe which is infinite - or merely large enough that many disconnected patches can form - and that the density varies in different regions (which is certainly the case on smaller scales, giving rise to galactic clusters and voids).

However, the anthropic principle has been criticised by many scientists. For example, in 1979 Bernard Carr and Martin Rees argued that the principle &quot;is entirely post hoc: it has not yet been used to predict any feature of the Universe.&quot; Others have taken objection to its philosophical basis, with Ernan McMullin writing in 1994 that &quot;the weak Anthropic principle is trivial ... and the strong Anthropic principle is indefensible.&quot; Since many physicists and philosophers of science do not consider the principle to be compatible with the scientific method, another explanation for the flatness problem was needed.

===Inflation===

The standard solution to the flatness problem invokes cosmic inflation, a process whereby the universe expands exponentially quickly (i.e. formula_4 grows as formula_29 with time formula_30, for some constant formula_31) during a short period in its early history. The theory of inflation was first proposed in 1979, and published in 1981, by Alan Guth. His two main motivations for doing so were the flatness problem and the horizon problem, another fine-tuning problem of physical cosmology. However, &quot;In December, 1980 when Guth was developing his inflation model, he was not trying to solve either the flatness or horizon problems. Indeed, at that time, he knew nothing of the horizon problem and had never quantitatively calculated the flatness problem&quot;. He was a particle physicist trying to solve the magnetic monopole problem.&quot;

The proposed cause of inflation is a field which permeates space and drives the expansion. The field contains a certain energy density, but unlike the density of the matter or radiation present in the late universe, which decrease over time, the density of the inflationary field remains roughly constant as space expands. Therefore, the term formula_17 increases extremely rapidly as the scale factor formula_4 grows exponentially. Recalling the Friedmann Equation

:formula_34,

and the fact that the right-hand side of this expression is constant, the term formula_35 must therefore decrease with time.

Thus if formula_35 initially takes any arbitrary value, a period of inflation can force it down towards 0 and leave it extremely small - around formula_37 as required above, for example. Subsequent evolution of the universe will cause the value to grow, bringing it to the currently observed value of around 0.01. Thus the sensitive dependence on the initial value of Ω has been removed: a large and therefore &#x27;unsurprising&#x27; starting value need not become amplified and lead to a very curved universe with no opportunity to form galaxies and other structures.

This success in solving the flatness problem is considered one of the major motivations for inflationary theory.

However, some physicists deny that inflationary theory resolves the flatness problem, arguing that it merely moves the fine-tuning from the probability distribution to the potential of a field, or even deny that it is a scientific theory.

===Post inflation===
Although inflationary theory is regarded as having had much success, and the evidence for it is compelling, it is not universally accepted: cosmologists recognize that there are still gaps in the theory and are open to the possibility that future observations will disprove it. In particular, in the absence of any firm evidence for what the field driving inflation should be, many different versions of the theory have been proposed. Many of these contain parameters or initial conditions which themselves require fine-tuning in much the way that the early density does without inflation.

For these reasons work is still being done on alternative solutions to the flatness problem. These have included non-standard interpretations of the effect of dark energy and gravity, particle production in an oscillating universe, and use of a Bayesian statistical approach to argue that the problem is non-existent. The latter argument, suggested for example by Evrard and Coles, maintains that the idea that Ω being close to 1 is &#x27;unlikely&#x27; is based on assumptions about the likely distribution of the parameter which are not necessarily justified. Despite this ongoing work, inflation remains by far the dominant explanation for the flatness problem. The question arises, however, whether it is still the dominant explanation because it is the best explanation, or because the community is unaware of progress on this problem. In particular, in addition to the idea that Ω is not a suitable parameter in this context, other arguments against the flatness problem have been presented: if the universe collapses in the future, then the flatness problem &quot;exists&quot;, but only for a relatively short time, so a typical observer would not expect to measure Ω appreciably different from 1; in the case of a universe which expands forever with a positive cosmological constant, fine-tuning is needed not to achieve a (nearly) flat universe, but also to avoid it.

===Einstein–Cartan theory===

The flatness problem is naturally solved by the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, without an exotic form of matter required in inflationary theory. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. It has no free parameters. Including torsion gives the correct conservation law for the total (orbital plus intrinsic) angular momentum of matter in the presence of gravity. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors obeying the nonlinear Dirac equation generates a spin-spin interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical big bang singularity, replacing it with a bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the Universe was contracting. The rapid expansion immediately after the big bounce explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. As the density of the Universe decreases, the effects of torsion weaken and the Universe smoothly enters the radiation-dominated era.

<text>A herbaceous border is a collection of perennial herbaceous plants (plants that live for more than two years and are soft-stemmed and non-woody) arranged closely together, usually to create a dramatic effect through colour, shape or large scale. The term herbaceous border is mostly in use in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. In North America, the term perennial border is normally used. 

Herbaceous borders as they are known today were first popularly used in gardens in the Victorian era. Hybridization and new imported plant species revolutionized the form of British gardens in the 18th and 19th centuries. In addition, the works of Gertrude Jekyll, a British 20th-century garden designer and prolific writer, popularized the use of the &quot;herbaceous border&quot; through a revival of the British cottage garden.

Maintaining the herbaceous border is work-intensive, as the perennials have to be dug up every 3–4 years and divided to keep the bed clean-looking and prevent overgrowth of the plants. In World War I this type of border became less popular in Britain as there was a shortage of labour to keep the gardens maintained. However, there are still some celebrated examples in British gardens.
According to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest herbaceous border, at 215 metres (705 ft), is at Dirleton Castle, East Lothian, Scotland.

<doc id="1118191" wikidata="Q972903" url="?curid=1118191" title="For Love of the Game">
<text>For Love of the Game is a novel by American author Michael Shaara, published posthumously in 1991. The book tells the story of fictional baseball great Billy Chapel, thirty-seven years old and nearing the end of his career.

==Plot summary==

On the second to last day of the season, Chapel&#x27;s team, the Atlanta Hawks (no relation to the NBA team of the same name), are about to play against the New York Yankees. Chapel receives news from a friend in the media that he is about to be traded. Just the night before, his girlfriend Jane did not show up at his hotel room, and Chapel reaches the conclusion that it is time to move on and finally make the transition from boyhood to manhood.

Over half the book tells the story of that final game, with flashbacks from the pitching mound and dugout to incidents throughout Chapel&#x27;s life. Chapel is determined that his last game will also be his greatest, even though, with all the young new players on the Yankees, they are a far superior team. As he strikes out his opponents one after the other, he soon becomes aware of the fact that he has held the Yankees at bay thus far, not allowing one hit from the more talented Yankees team. He soon becomes determined to pitch a perfect game. Meanwhile, he reflects on his personal life, and especially on Carol, whom he finally realizes that he loves, even though he has never shown her that he really does. That morning Carol told him she was going to London and was leaving immediately, so the two key passions of his life, Carol and baseball, are about to vanish forever.

As the game proceeds, Chapel feels the sharp pain in his arm that comes with age. Nevertheless, he refuses to give up the pitching mound, and chooses instead to divert his attention by delving deeper into his life and his relationship. At the end of the game, he has pitched a perfect game and retires from baseball with a new dignity. After the celebrations, he heads to the hotel and dials Carol&#x27;s home, where he plans to go to tell Carol his feelings. With baseball behind him, he has grown from a boy who has led a life into manhood.

This short book was discovered after Shaara&#x27;s death, and publishing was arranged by his son, author Jeffrey Shaara. The book was made into a movie by Sam Raimi.

<text>Garmin Ltd. is an American multinational technology company based in Olathe, Kansas. The company designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communication, sensor-based, and information products to the automotive, aviation, marine, outdoors, and sport markets. 

Garmin was founded in 1989 by Gary Burrell and Min Kao in Lenexa, Kansas. In 1996, the company established corporate headquarters in Olathe, Kansas. Since 2010, the company has been legally incorporated in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, with principal subsidiaries located in the United States, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.

As of 2023, the company has over 20,000 employees in 34 countries with an operating income of 5.23 billion USD. Garmin was initially associated with personal in-car navigation devices, but now offers several product lines across different markets, with an emphasis on smartwatch technology. In 2022, Garmin smartwatches represented the largest market share of the premium smartwatch market (watches greater than $500), leading to it having the fifth largest share of overall smartwatches sold and the third by revenue.

As of February 2023, Garmin has shipped more than 282 million products worldwide. 

== History ==

=== Founding and initial growth: 1989 to 1999 ===
In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio. They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas, as &quot;ProNav&quot;. ProNav&#x27;s first product was a GPS unit for boaters called GPS 100. It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition, where it garnered 5,000 orders. A short time later, in 1991, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Taiwan. 

The company was later renamed &quot;Garmin&quot;, a portmanteau of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao. In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.

In 1994, Garmin released GPS 155, the first IFR-certified aviation navigation system. By 1995, Garmin&#x27;s sales had reached $102 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. In 1996, the company headquarters moved to Olathe, Kansas. A year later, Garmin sold its one millionth unit.

In 1998, Garmin released the GNS 430 and StreetPilot. GNS 430 was an integrated avionics system that served as both GPS navigation receiver and communications transceiver. StreetPilot was Garmin’s first portable navigation system for cars.

=== GPS growth and additional markets: 2000 to 2018 ===
On Dec. 8, 2000, Garmin began public trading on NASDAQ with a stock price of $14 per share. Twenty-one years later on Dec. 7, 2021, the company transferred its listing to the New York Stock Exchange.

By 2000, Garmin had sold three million GNSS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of August 22, 2000, the company held 35 patents on GNSS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom.

In 2003, Garmin announced its G1000 integrated cockpit system (though it was not available until 2004 when it received FAA certification). It was first adopted by aircraft makers including Cessna and Diamond Aircraft, and later would be installed as forward-fit and retrofit applications in regional airliners, business jets and turboprops, light airplanes, helicopters, and military and government aircraft.

That same year, Garmin launched Forerunner 201, a fitness smartwatch for runners that was the first wrist-based GPS trainer.

In 2005, Garmin launched nüvi, its first compact car navigator. In 2006, Garmin released its first GPS-enabled cycling computer, Edge. That same year, the company introduced a new corporate logo, and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

In 2007, the company introduced its first touchscreen marine chartplotters, the GPSMAP 5000 series for international boaters.

In 2011, Garmin released its first GPS watch for the sport of golfing: the Approach S1. A year later in 2012, the company released its fēnix adventure smartwatch, designed for outdoor sports and recreation.

2014 saw the release of Vivofit, Garmin’s first wearable fitness band with a replaceable battery with over one year of battery life. Vivofit tracks a wearer’s steps and learns an individual’s activity level in order to adjust daily goals. 2014 was also the year that Garmin acquired the New Zealand company Fusion Electronics Limited and its subsidiaries. After the acquisition, the company, which sold integrated marine audio products and accessories, became known as Garmin New Zealand Ltd.

In 2015, Garmin launched Panoptix, the first product to provide real-time live sonar for anglers.

A year later, in 2016, Garmin acquired DeLorme, which gave Garmin DeLorme’s inReach satellite communication technology with interactive SOS messaging. The inReach Satellite Communicator had been the first personal satellite communication device equipped for two-way text messaging using satellites. In 2017, Garmin released their first devices made with inReach: the inReach SE+ and Explorer+.

In 2017, Garmin released its first dive computer with surface GPS, the Descent Mk1. The Mk1 also provides an altimeter and HR monitor, and uses Garmin’s fenix 5X platform for everyday activity tracking.

=== Recent market expansion: 2018 to present ===
In 2018, Garmin improved its Panoptix technology by combining it with Livescope. The new Panoptix Livescope provided both scanning or imaging sonar as well as real-time, live sonar.

In April 2018, Garmin launched Connect IQ 3.0  along with new apps—MySwim Pro, Yelp, Trailforks and iHeartRadio. In May 2018, Garmin partnered with the University of Kansas Medical Center to tackle sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.

In 2019, Garmin announced the release of new technologies in several fields. In its Automotive segment, there was an all-terrain, all-in-one GPS, the Garmin Overlander; for the Marine segment, a freshwater trolling motor, the Force; and under Garmin’s Aviation segment, an emergency autonomous landing system for aircraft, Garmin Autoland.

In 2020, Garmin Autoland won the Robert J. Collier Trophy for outstanding contributions to aviation and aerospace.

The following year, Garmin introduced the FDA-cleared ECG app, allowing users to record heart rhythm and check for atrial fibrillation.

In 2023, Garmin announced a two-year study with the U.S. Space Force. Under the study, over 6000 Garmin Forerunner 55 and Instinct 2 Solar watches were given to members of Space Force (known as Guardians). The study aims to answer the question of whether or not regular active fitness testing can be replaced by fitness assessments made with data from the smartwatches. In addition to their health and wellness features, the watches were chosen because they have the ability to disable GPS functionality, should there be a need for higher military privacy and security. That same year, the company announced that Garmin fenix 7 watches would be used by crew members  during the Polaris Dawn space mission to monitor health stats and vitals. 

In 2024, the Independent Boat Builders, Inc. (IBBI) selected Garmin as its exclusive marine electronics and audio supplier. The selection starts in model year 2025 and runs through 2029.

=== Leadership ===
Cliff Pemble is the current CEO of Garmin.

In October 2023, Garmin’s co-founders, Gary Burrrell and Dr. Min Kao, were named to the U.S. National Aviation Hall of Fame class of 2024.

Burrell retired in 2002 as Garmin&#x27;s chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as co-chairman of its board of directors. He remained chairman emeritus until his death in 2019. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.

In 2005, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Kao&#x27;s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Burrell&#x27;s net worth as $940 million. 

=== July 2020 outage ===
On July 23, 2020, Garmin shut down its call centres, website and some online services, including Garmin Connect and flyGarmin, after a ransomware attack encrypted its internal network and some production systems. The company did not say it was a ransomware attack, but company employees writing on social media described it as such, with some speculation about a ransomware strain called WastedLocker later confirmed. Hackers reportedly demanded a $10 million ransom from Garmin. The company instituted a &quot;multi-day maintenance window&quot; to deal with the attack&#x27;s impacts. Some Garmin online services began to function again on July 27, 2020, though delays in synchronising data with connected applications were expected; Strava anticipated a delay of &quot;a week or longer&quot;. Experts speculated that Garmin had paid hackers a reported $10m ransom, or brokered some other kind of deal.

The outage meant Garmin could not receive calls or emails, or conduct online chats. Athlete users of Garmin wearables could not upload mileage, location, heart rate, and other data. Pilots were unable to download data for Garmin aircraft navigational systems, preventing flight scheduling. Garmin said there was &quot;no indication&quot; that personal information had been stolen.

== Operations ==
In 2010, Garmin opened a facility in Cary, North Carolina as part of the Research Triangle Park. Garmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan. It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).

=== Garmin-AT subsidiary ===
In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm&#x27;s II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.

II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS&#x27; Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches. The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA&#x27;s TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS &quot;sole source&quot; navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV glideslope approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment. Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.

In 1999: &quot;Flight International&quot; magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety.

Garmin Aviation offers electronically integrated cockpits for aircraft: panel mount displays, primary flight displays (PFD) and multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar, and other types of avionic systems. Garmin entered this market in 1991 with the &quot;GPS-100AVD&quot; panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the &quot;GPS-95&quot;, was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the &quot;GPS-155&quot; panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches. In 1998, Garmin introduced the &quot;GNS-430&quot;, an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver. That same year, the company rolled out its first integrated GPS, COM, VOR, LOC and glideslope product, the GNS 430. More than 125,000 GNS navigators are now installed in aircraft. Garmin reached its one millionth delivery in November 2017.

The G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft, the similar G950 is used in experimental aircraft, and the G600 is a retrofit.

On October 30, 2019, Garmin announced that the Piper M600 and Cirrus Vision Jet would become the first general aviation aircraft certified with the company&#x27;s emergency autoland system, which is capable of automatically landing the aircraft with the push of a button and will be a part of both aircraft&#x27;s G3000 integrated avionics suite in 2020. Garmin calls the new technology &quot;Autonomí&quot;.
Garmin plans to equip other platforms in 2020, like the TBM 940, and hopes to eventually expand its offer to the G1000 avionics suite. In June 2021, Garmin Autoland won the 2020 Collier Trophy.

=== Laptop GPS and mobile apps ===
In April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.

Garmin offers mobile apps for various purposes for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone.

<text>In British English, haslet or acelet is a pork meatloaf with herbs, originally from Lincolnshire. The word is derived from the Old French meaning &quot;entrails&quot;. In Lincolnshire, haslet (pronounced &#x27;/ˈhæslɪt/&#x27; locally) is typically made from stale white bread, minced pork, sage, salt and black pepper. It is typically served cold with pickles and salad, or as a sandwich filling. In England, it is occasionally sold on a delicatessen counter.

Welsh haslet is traditionally made from finely minced potatoes, pigs&#x27; liver and onions.

In North American English, &quot;haslet&quot; refers to the &quot;edible viscera of a butchered animal&quot;.

<text>Cobra Trap is the title of a short story collection by Peter O&#x27;Donnell featuring his action/adventure heroine Modesty Blaise. The book was published in 1996, and is the thirteenth, and final book in the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; series which began in 1965. &quot;Cobra Trap&quot; was released 11 years after the previous book in the series, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Handle&quot;. It was the final book to be written by O&#x27;Donnell before his death in 2010.

== Contents ==
The stories featured in the collection are &quot;Bellman&quot;, &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;, &quot;Old Alex&quot;, &quot;The Girl With the Black Balloon&quot; and &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;. &quot;Bellman&quot; is an adaptation of the 1968 comic strip serial &quot;The Killing Ground&quot;.

All five stories take place at different times in the life of Modesty Blaise. The first, &quot;Bellman&quot;, begins with a flashback to when Modesty is 20 years old. In &quot;The Dark Angels&quot; Modesty is in her late 20s, in &quot;Old Alex&quot; she is in her early 30s, in &quot;The Girl With the Black Balloon&quot; she is in her late 30s, and finally in &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;, she is about 52. Ages are approximate because they are not specified and Modesty does not know her exact age.

In &quot;Old Alex&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell makes it clear that fictional Modesty has a different rate of ageing than real people. The &quot;Old Alex&quot; story is set in 1997, so assuming that stories in the first books took place around 1965–1970, then Blaise aged something like eight years during an actual 30-year period.

&quot;Cobra Trap&quot;, the title piece of the collection, is (among fans) the most controversial Modesty Blaise story, in that it profiles the final mission of Modesty and her partner, Willie Garvin. The story takes place 10–15 years after the time frame of the comic strip/novels. Modesty, who has been recently diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and given only a short time to live, chooses to give her life to save a train full of innocents, including many children, from a group of rebels. Soon after revealing her illness to Willie, Modesty is killed in an attack, and shortly after that Willie too is shot dead. The story ends with the two friends reuniting in some form of (walkabout-like) afterlife.

When Peter O&#x27;Donnell brought his comic strip to a close five years later he chose to do so with a more upbeat story promising future adventures. In addition, the literary canon does not exist in the same continuity as the comic strip (owing to situations and characters differing.)

In 2002, a comic book adaptation of &quot;The Dark Angels&quot; was published in Scandinavia as a postscript to the British &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; daily strip; Enrique Badia Romero, the final artist on the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; comic strip, adapted the story for the publication. To date its only English-language publication has been in the American magazine &quot;Comics Revue&quot;.

Elements of several other stories (in particular &quot;Old Alex&quot; and &quot;Bellman&quot;) also appeared in the comic strip prior to being featured in &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;.

The original first edition cover art for &quot;Cobra Trap&quot; was a painting of Modesty Blaise by Jim Holdaway, who had drawn the original comic strip for O&#x27;Donnell from 1963 until his death in 1970.

&quot;Cobra Trap&quot; was at one point considered one of the rarest of the Modesty Blaise book series as it is the only one that was not initially made available in paperback and the hardcover editions went out of print and are considered collectables. However, Souvenir Press released a paperback edition of the collection in 2006, 10 years after the hardcover release, putting the book into wide circulation again.

<doc id="1118214" wikidata="Q422995" url="?curid=1118214" title="Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary">
<text>The Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (, ) is a protected area in Thailand in the northern part of Kanchanaburi Province and the southern part of Tak Province. It was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1972, and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1991 together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary.

==Location and topography==
The sanctuary is at the western national border of Thailand with Burma, in the southern area of the Dawna Range. It extends northeast of the Three Pagodas Pass from Sangkhla Buri District in Kanchanaburi Province into Umphang District in Tak Province.

The wildlife sanctuary stretches over an area of 2,279,500 rai ~ , and is the largest protected area in Thailand.
Together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary () it constitutes the core area of the Western Forest Complex, which represents the largest agglomeration of contiguous protected area in mainland Southeast Asia, .&lt;br&gt;
Management of this wildlife sanctuary is split between two protected areas regional offices: PARO 14 (Tak) manages the east part and PARO 3 (Ban Pong) manages the west part of this wildlife sanctuary. 
* Thung Yai Naresuan West Wildlife Sanctuary, 1,331,062 rai ~ 
* Thung Yai Naresuan East Wildlife Sanctuary, 948,438 rai ~ 

The area is predominantly mountainous and composed of various limestones interspersed with massive intrusions of granite and smaller outcrops of quartzite and schist. Elevations range from about at the Vajiralongkorn Reservoir in the south of the sanctuary to its highest peak, Khao Tai Pa, at . Major rivers are the Mae Klong and the Mae Chan which originate in the Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary and join in Thung Yai into the Upper Khwae Yai which feeds the Si Nakharin Reservoir. Various smaller rivers in the south and southwest feed the Vajiralongkorn Reservoir while in the northwestern part of the sanctuary the Mae Kasat and the Mae Suriya flow into Burma.

==Climate and rainfall==
The climate of the region is characterised by three seasons: a hot, wet season from May to October, a cooler, dry period from November to January and a hot, dry season from February to April. Average minimum and maximum daily temperatures range from in the wet season, in the hot, dry season, and in the cooler season. Day-time temperatures can exceed in April, while nighttime temperatures of are not uncommon in the cool season.

The average annual rainfall decreases from the western part of the sanctuary receiving a year to annual rainfalls of between 1,600 and 2,000 millimetres in the eastern parts of the sanctuary. Over 80 percent of the rain is brought by the southwest monsoon from the Andaman Sea.

==Flora and habitat types==
Phytogeographically the sanctuary lies at the interface between the terminal southern ridges of the eastern Himalayas and the equatorial forests of the great Sunda Shelf. As most of the sanctuary is botanically unexplored, scientific knowledge about its rich flora is sparse.

montane evergreen forests cover about 15 percent of the sanctuary and occur along the mountain ridges above 1,000 metres where moisture levels are high.

Seasonal or dry evergreen forests are found on about 31 percent of the area, predominantly on land lying between 800 and 1,000 metres elevation. Gallery evergreen forests occur along permanent watercourses, where humidity is high and the soil perpetually moist. They are often categorized under dry evergreen forests, but are particularly important to the sanctuary&#x27;s fauna.

Mixed deciduous forest is the most common forest type in Thung Yai, covering about 45 percent, predominantly in areas below elevation.

Dry dipterocarp forest is a formation unique to mainland Southeast Asia and is found on about one percent of the area.

Savanna forest and grassland covers about four percent, predominantly in the &quot;thung yai&quot; or &quot;big field&quot; covering about 140 km2 at the centre of the sanctuary.
The remaining 4% of the area are categorized as secondary forests, fallow areas, and swidden fields in the nomination for the World Heritage Site, but include also various Bamboo forests which are not included in this classification.

==Fauna==
Like the flora, the fauna of Thung Yai provides a specific mix of species with Sundaic, Indo-Chinese, Indo-Burmese and Sino-Himalayan affinities due to the sanctuary&#x27;s particular biogeographic location. The savanna forest of Thung Yai is the most complete and secure example of Southeast Asia&#x27;s dry tropical forest.

Among the mammal species living in Thung Yai are lar gibbon (&quot;Hylobates lar&quot;), various species of macaque (&quot;Macaca&quot;) and lutung (&quot;Trachypithecus&quot;), Indochinese tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;), Indochinese leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus delacouri&quot;), clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;), sun bear (&quot;Helarctos malayanus&quot;) and Asian black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;), Malayan tapir (&quot;Tapirus indicus&quot;), Indian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus indicus&quot;), gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), hog deer (&quot;Cervus porcinus&quot;), sambar (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;), Fea&#x27;s muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus feae&quot;) und Sumatran serow (&quot;Capricornis sumatraensis&quot;) as well as many bat species probably including Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat (&quot;Craseonycteris thonglongyai&quot;). Thung Yai is part of the Western Forest Complex, which is the largest tiger habitat in the Southeast Asia region, with around 200 of the animals living there. The area is known as a natural breeding area for tigers in Thailand and Myanmar as well.

Banteng (&quot;Bos javanicus&quot;) and wild water buffalo (&quot;Bubalus amee&quot;) are known to occur in the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and may exist in Thung Yai too. Indications for the occurrence of Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros (&quot;Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus&quot;) and northern Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis&quot;) in the area are recorded from the 1980s, but have not been confirmed since then.

Bird species sighted in Thung Yai include white-winged wood duck (&quot;Cairina scutulata&quot;), kalij pheasant (&quot;Lophura leucomelanos&quot;), grey peacock-pheasant (&quot;Polyplectron bicalcaratum&quot;), green peafowl (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;), spot-billed pelican (&quot;Pelecanus philippensis&quot;), Oriental darter (&quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;), painted stork (&quot;Mycteria leucocephala&quot;), greater adjutant (&quot;Leptoptilos dubius&quot;), red-headed vulture (&quot;Sarcogyps calvus&quot;), mountain hawk-eagle (&quot;Nisaetus nipalensis&quot;), lesser fish eagle (&quot;Ichthyophaga humilis&quot;) and all six species of hornbill (&quot;Bucerotidae&quot;) living in mainland Southeast Asia.

The nomination for the two wildlife sanctuaries, Thung Yai Naresuan and Huai Kha Khaeng, to become World Heritage Sites lists some 120 species of mammal, 400 birds, 96 reptiles, 43 amphibians, and 113 species of fish, but research on the biodiversity in the sanctuaries is sparse.

===Poaching===
According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, the preserve, &quot;... has been notorious for decades as an area where rich and powerful people enjoy poaching and game hunting.&quot; In early 2018, Premchai Karnasuta, the president of the Italian-Thai Development PLC (ITD), one of Thailand&#x27;s largest construction companies, was arrested in the sanctuary in possession of skinned carcasses of protected wild animals, including a black leopard, a Kalij pheasant, and a common muntjac (also known as a barking deer), as well as three rifles and ammunition. Premchai faces several charges including trespassing and poaching. He has maintained his innocence. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it,&quot; he told local media. He has failed to explain, however, why he was in the wildlife sanctuary and how the carcasses of the freshly killed leopard and several other endangered animals ended up in his possession. If convicted, he may be incarcerated for up to 28 years. Conservationists fear that the billionaire will be let off lightly for a wildlife crime that would see an average citizen sent to prison for years.
In the most high-profile poaching case, on 29 April 1973 a military helicopter crashed in the sanctuary, killing six high-ranking police and military officers. It turned out that they were part of a group of more than 50 officers on an illegal four-day hunting trip in the preserve. The report claimed these hunters cooked and ate the animals they killed at parties. The military refused to admit wrongdoing and the event was brushed aside by the prime minister. The scandal eventually led to the 14 October uprising that ended the military government and led to a three-year period of democratic rule.

Illegal poaching by the rich and powerful is common in Thailand, said a spokesman for the Wildlife Friends Foundation. &quot;The police, rich people and government officials do it all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it&#x27;s because rich people want to show off to their friends that they have &quot;barami&quot; (, social power), that they can afford to hunt because they have so much money.&quot;

==History==
Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic stone tools have been found in the Khwae Noi and Khwae Yai River valleys and parts of the sanctuary were inhabited by Neolithic man. For at least 700 years, the Dawna-Tenasserim region has been home to Mon and Karen people, but burial grounds in Thung Yai and Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary have not been systematically researched.

The Thai name &quot;Thung Yai Naresuan&quot; refers to the &quot;big field&quot; (&quot;thung yai&quot;) or savanna in the centre of the sanctuary, and to King Naresuan, a famous Siamese ruler who supposedly based his army in the area to wage war against Burma sometime during his reign of the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1590 until his death in 1605.

The Karen people who live in the sanctuary call the savanna &quot;pia aethala aethea&quot; which may be translated as &quot;place of the knowing sage&quot;. It refers to the area as a place where ascetic hermits called &quot;aethea&quot; have lived and meditated and may do so even today. The Karen in Thung Yai regard them as holy men important for their history and identity in Thung Yai and revere them in a specific cult.

Historical sources as well as local oral tradition suggest that settlement of Karen people in Thung Yai did not occur before the second half of the 18th century. At that time, due to political and religious persecution in Burma, predominantly Pwo-Karen from the hinterlands of Moulmein and Tavoy migrated into the area northeast of the Three Pagodas Pass, where they received formal settlement rights from the Siamese Governor of Kanchanaburi. Sometime between 1827 and 1839 the Siamese King Rama III established this area as a principality (&quot;mueang&quot;) and the Karen leader who governed the principality received the Siamese title of nobility &quot;Phra Si Suwannakhiri&quot;. During the second half of the 19th century, this Karen principality at the Burmese border became particularly important for the Siamese King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) in his negotiations with the British colonial power in Burma regarding the demarcation of their western border with Siam.

At the beginning of the 20th century, when the modern Thai nation state was established, the Karen in Thung Yai lost their former status and importance. During the first half of the 20th century, external political influences were minimal in Thung Yai and the Karen communities were highly autonomous regarding their internal affairs. This changed in the second half of the 20th century, when the Thai nation state extended its institutions into the peripheral areas and the Karen re-appeared as &quot;chao khao&quot; or &quot;hill tribes&quot; on the national political agenda, as forest destroyers and illegal immigrants.

Plans to protect the forests and wildlife at the upper Khwae Yai and Khwae Noi river grew in the mid-1960s. Due to strong logging and mining interests in the area, it was not before 1972 that the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary could be established, and Thung Yai resistance was even stronger. However, in April 1973 a military helicopter crashed near Thung Yai and revealed an illegal hunting party of senior military officers with family members, businessmen, and a film star, arousing nationwide public outrage which finally led to the fall of the Thanom-Prapas Regime after the uprising of 14 October 1973. After this accident and under a new democratic government, the area finally could be declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1974. After the military had taken power once again in October 1976, many of the activists of the democracy movement fled into peripheral regions of the country and some of them found refuge among the Karen people living in Thung Yai.

During the 1960s, not only timber and ore, but also the water of the western forests as hydroelectric power resources became of interest for commercial profit and national development. A system of several big dams was planned to produce electricity for the growing urban centres. On the Khwae Yai River the Si Nakharin Dam was finished in 1980 and the Tha Thung Na Dam in 1981, while the Khao Laem Dam (renamed Vajiralongkorn Dam) on the Khwae Noi River south of Thung Yai was completed in 1984. The Nam Choan Dam, the last of the projected dams, was supposed to flood a forest area of about 223 km2 within the Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary.

A public dispute about the Nam Choan Dam project lasted for more than six years, dominating national politics and public debate in early-1988 before it was shelved in April that year. Pointing to the high value of Thung Yai for nature conservation and biodiversity, dam opponents on the national and international level raised the possibility of declaring the area a world heritage site. This prestigious option would have been lost with a huge dam and reservoir in the middle of the two wildlife sanctuaries most promising to meet the requirements for a global heritage.

After the dam project was shelved, the proposal to UNESCO was written by Seub Nakhasathien and another outspoken opponent of the Nam Choan Dam, and, in December 1991, Thung Yai Naresuan together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was declared a Natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In the nomination, the &quot;outstanding universal value&quot; of the two sanctuaries is, in first place, justified with their extraordinary high biodiversity due to their unique position at the junction of four biogeographic zones, as well as with its size and &quot;the undisturbed nature of its habitats&quot;. The death of Seub Nakhasathien, the forest conservator instrumental in the UNESCO listing who committed suicide in 1990, transformed the status of Thung Yai Naresuan and the adjacent Huay Kha Kaeng Complex into a sacrosanct site and inspired many young persons to become forest patrol staff.

Even though the UNESCO nomination explicitly emphasizes the &quot;undisturbed nature&quot; of the area, and notwithstanding scientific studies supporting traditional settlement and use rights of the Karen people in Thung Yai as well as the sustainability of their traditional land use system and their strong intention to remain in their homeland and to protect it, governmental authorities regard the people living in Thung Yai as a threat to the sanctuary and pursue their resettlement.

Karen villages in Huai Kha Khaeng were removed when the sanctuary was established in 1972, and in the late-1970s the remaining communities in Huai Kha Khaeng had to leave when the Si Nakharin Dam flooded their settlement areas. During the 1980s and early-1990s, villages of the Hmong ethnic minority group were removed from the Huai Kha Khaeng and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuaries. The resettlement of the remaining Karen in Thung Yai was announced in the management plan for the sanctuary, drafted in the late-1980s, as well as in the proposal for the world heritage site. But, when the Thai Royal Forest Department tried to remove them in the early-1990s, it had to reverse the resettlement scheme due to strong public criticism. Since then, the authorities have used repression, intimidation, and terror to convince the Karen to leave their homeland &quot;voluntarily&quot;, and placed restrictions on their traditional land use system which will inevitably cause its breakdown and deprive the Karen of subsistence.

 the sanctuary employs about 200 staff to care for more than . The sanctuary is larger than the total area of Bangkok, which is 98,000 rai in size. There are 25 ranger stations inside the sanctuary. Each station is assigned three firearms, some inoperable. Sanctuary staff patrol some 12,000 km of forest paths, and another 10,000 km in the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng sanctuary. The Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) calculates that each forest staffer needs to police . In Thailand overall there are 443 protected forest zones totalling , or 20.68 percent of the country&#x27;s total area. The government allocates a budget of around 61 baht per rai to manage them.

<text>The Buick Reatta is a low-volume transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive, two-door, two-seater grand tourer manufactured and marketed by Buick as a coupe (1988–1991) and convertible (1990–1991) — both featuring a 3.8 liter V6 engine and shortened version of the GM E platform, shared with the seventh generation Buick Riviera.

As Buick&#x27;s first two-seater and its first convertible since the 1985 Riviera, the Reatta was manufactured in a highly specialized assembly program at the Reatta Craft Center (later known as the Lansing Craft Center) in Lansing, Michigan—achieving production of over 21,000 units in four years.

==Overview==

For the Reatta&#x27;s manufacture at the Reatta Craft Center, specialized teams of workers assembled the car at a series of stations rather than on a conventional assembly line. After a team had completed their portion of the assembly, the car would be moved by robots to the next station. Paintwork was performed on site under subcontract to PPG Industries.

The Reatta used GM&#x27;s transverse Buick 3800 V6 with 165–170 hp (123–127 kW) and 210–220 lb·ft (285–298 N·m) of torque with the highest output in the last year of production. The car used a fully independent suspension, 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS, and front wheel drive. Top speed was electronically limited to 125 mph (201 km/h). The Reatta was rated at 18 mpg (13.1 L/100 km) in the city and 27 mpg (8.7 L/100 km) on the highway.

Intended as a halo car for Buick, production was projected at 20,000 Reattas annually, and was available while the Cadillac Allanté and Pontiac Fiero were also available. GM announced the end of production in early 1991.

==Features==

The Reatta featured twin bucket seats with a storage area behind the seats featuring two lockable bins and a lockable access hatch to the rear trunk. At introduction, options included 16-way power seats in lieu of 6-way power seats, side moldings in either black or body color and pinstripe delete. A sunroof became optional in late 1988, and in 1989 keyless entry was added as a standard feature. The 1988 listed retail price was $25,000 ($ in dollars ).

The Reatta had the distinction of being Buick&#x27;s only car with pop-up headlamps with the entire headlamp assembly moving up and down. The other Buick cars with hidden headlamps, the Riviera (1965–1969) and the Skyhawk (1987–1989 for certain trim levels), had fixed headlamps hidden behind moveable covers.

Initially (1988–89), the Reatta featured a touchscreen computer interface, marketed as the &quot;Electronic Control Center&quot; (ECC), that included radio and climate control functions, date reminder, trip computer and user-configurable overspeed alarm, as well as diagnostic access to the vehicle&#x27;s electronic systems and sensors. The Reatta was the second car to ever feature a touchscreen after the 1986 Buick Rivera. Later models were equipped with conventional push-button stereo and climate controls. The new system eliminated the trip computer functionality and the climate control buttons could access diagnostic information, replacing the diagnostic scanner capability formerly provided by the touchscreen.

In 1990, the interior was redesigned, adding a driver&#x27;s airbag and an optional CD player. In 1991, the &quot;L27&quot; 3800 engine and 4T60-E transmission replaced the &quot;LN3&quot; and hydraulic 4T60 units and the Reatta received a new ABS system, new 16&quot; wheels, automatic headlamps and a cup holder built into the armrest.

Each Reatta included a leather book containing the owner&#x27;s manual and a pen. In 1990 and 1991, a zippered owner&#x27;s folio was included holding the owner&#x27;s manual, pen, flashlight and tire gauge, as well as a &quot;Craftsman&#x27;s Log&quot; with the signatures of the supervisors for the car&#x27;s assembly.
In 1988, approximately fifty-five examples were designated &quot;Select Sixties&quot; and allocated to Buick&#x27;s top sixty dealers. The models, internally designated model X22, featured a black exterior, tan interior, and unique &quot;Select Sixty&quot; hood emblems.

In 1990, the Select Sixty program was repeated, with sixty-five white convertibles including special emblems, and a flame red interior with white bucket seats, white 16-inch wheels, and cup holder.

==Convertible==
After a delayed introduction due to design difficulties, Buick introduced the convertible Reatta in 1990 with a manually-operated top designed by ASC, available in vinyl or cloth with a glass rear window and electric defroster. When retracted, the top was protected by a rigid tonneau cover. The 1991 models featured power pull-down motors to assist in tightening the rear bow of the top to the tonneau cover.

A Buick convertible would not be offered again until the four-seat Buick Cascada debuted in 2016.
==Production==

The first pilot car was finished at the Reatta Craft Centre in December 1986. Series production began in January 1988 and ended on May 10, 1991. The original car was sometimes referred to as a &quot;1988½ model year&quot;, owing to its January introduction.

<text>William Dwight Whitney (February 9, 1827June 7, 1894) was an American linguist, philologist, and lexicographer known for his work on Sanskrit grammar and Vedic philology as well as his influential view of language as a social institution. He was the first president of the American Philological Association and editor-in-chief of &quot;The Century Dictionary&quot;.

==Life==
William Dwight Whitney was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, on February 9, 1827. His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney (1786–1869) of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Sarah Williston (1800–1833) of Easthampton, Massachusetts.

Whitney entered Williams College at fifteen, graduating in 1845. He continued studying and worked at a bank in Northampton for several years. He was at first interested in natural sciences, and assisted his older brother Josiah Whitney on a geological survey of the Lake Superior region in 1849, having charge of the botany, the barometrical observations and the accounts. On this expedition, he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours. Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut.

In 1850, Whitney left the United States to study philology, and especially Sanskrit, in Germany. There, he spent his winters at Berlin studying under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber, and his summers were devoted to research under Rudolph von Roth at Tübingen. It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project, &quot;preparation of an edition and translation of the &quot;Atharva-veda&quot;.&quot;

He gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field. In 1853, Yale University offered Whitney a position as &quot;Professor of Sanskrit&quot;, a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States. It was not until 1861, however, that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau. He also taught modern languages at the Sheffield Scientific School, and served as secretary to the American Oriental Society from 1857 until he became its president in 1884. The American Philosophical Society elected Whitney to membership in 1863.

On August 28, 1856, Whitney married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin. She was the daughter of Roger Sherman Baldwin, US Senator and Governor of the State of Connecticut.
They had six children:
# Edward Baldwin Whitney was born August 16, 1857, became Assistant US Attorney General, and had son mathematician Hassler Whitney.
#Williston Clapp Whitney was born April 2, 1859, but died March 11, 1861.
# Marian Parker Whitney was born February 6, 1861, became a professor of German at Vassar College and trustee of Connecticut College for Women
# Roger Sherman Baldwin Whitney was born January 6, 1863, but died January 17, 1874.
# Emily Henrietta Whitney was born August 29, 1864.
# Margaret Dwight Whitney was born November 19, 1866.

He died at his home, on Whitney Avenue, on June 7, 1894.

==Career==
Whitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot;, and in 1869 became a founder and first president of the &quot;American Philological Association&quot;. In the same year he also became Yale&#x27;s professor of comparative philology. Whitney also gave instruction in French and German in the college until 1867, and in the Sheffield scientific school until 1886. He wrote metrical translations of the &quot;Vedas&quot;, and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics, many of which were collected in the &quot;Oriental and Linguistic Studies&quot; series (1872–74). He wrote several books on language, and grammar textbooks of English, French, German, and Sanskrit.

His &quot;Sanskrit Grammar&quot; (1879) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the Ashtadhyayi, the Sanskrit grammar attributed to Panini. Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as &quot;containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules (in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness).&quot;

In his &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot; in the chapter on the &#x27;Immutability and Mutability of the Sign&#x27;, Ferdinand de Saussure credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs.

The linguist Roman Jakobson (Jakobson 1965, 23-4) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution. In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 1870s, language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs. This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by Ferdinand de Saussure, and it entered into the posthumous edition of his &#x27;Course&#x27;, adjusted by his disciples C. Bally and Albert Sechehaye (1916). The teacher declares: &quot;On the essential point it seems to us that the American linguist is right: language is a convention, and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent.&quot; Jakobson writes, Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign: &quot;The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary.&quot; The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle &quot;but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place.&quot;

Although he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years, he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected &quot;Century Dictionary&quot;, which appeared from 1889 to 1891.

<text>Aversa () is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Caserta in Campania, southern Italy, about 24 km north of Naples. It is the centre of an agricultural district, the &quot;Agro Aversano&quot;, producing wine and cheese (famous for the typical buffalo mozzarella). Aversa is also the main seat of the faculties of Architecture and Engineering of the &quot;Università degli studi della Campania &quot;L. Vanvitelli&quot;&quot; (Campania University &quot;L. Vanvitelli&quot;). With a population of 52,974 (2017), it is the second city of the province after Caserta.

==Geography==
Aversa is located near the city of Naples; it is separated by only 24 kilometres from Naples and by 26 kilometres from Caserta, the administrative centre of the province of the same name. The municipality borders Carinaro, Casaluce, Cesa, Frignano, Giugliano in Campania, Gricignano di Aversa, Lusciano, San Marcellino, Sant&#x27;Antimo, Teverola and Trentola Ducenta.

It is located in a fertile coastal plain north of Naples, thus serving as a market for agricultural products to the city. The plain on which it sits was known in ancient Roman times as the Campania Felix.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Archaeological sites excavated near Aversa have revealed human presence in the area since the Neolithic period. Some say that the founding of the ancient city took place with the Etruscans.

In any case, because of endemic malaria that ravaged the region, the primitive city was abandoned.

===Lower middle ages===
Only a small military fortification, a castellum, still stands in the area, which is linked to a chapel in memory of the current alleged passage through Aversa by the Apostle Paul in the year 61. A.D., via the Roman road that ran towards Rome.

===Aversa County===
:&quot;See also List of counts of Aversa&quot;.
The present-day Aversa, which replaced the nearby city of Atella that had been laid waste during the Gothic Wars, was the first of the Norman territories in the Mediterranean. In 1030, the site was ceded to Rainulf Drengot, a cadet of the lords of Quarrel near Alençon in Normandy; he was invested as count by Duke Sergius IV of Naples and confirmed by Emperor Conrad II. By offering a generous principle of asylum for the persecuted, Rainulf enlarged the power and importance of his little &quot;borgo&quot;, which became the base from which the Normans forged a state in Sicily and Italy. The diplomacy of Robert Guiscard, who built the fortifications, led to the investiture of a bishop responsible to the Pope at Aversa, which was nominally territory of the Eastern Emperor. One of the first bishops was the Norman Guitmund (died c. 1090–95), a Benedictine monk, theologian, and opponent of Berengar of Tours.

The count of Aversa, Richard I, was one of the chief leaders in the struggle against the Papal forces which culminated in the Battle of Civitella del Fortore (1053) in Beneventan territory; even Pope Leo IX himself was captured at what turned into a rout in favour of the Normans. The astute Richard did not treat the pope as a prisoner, however, but escorted him back to Rome with full honours, a gesture that led to the conciliation of the Normans with the Church, the lifting of the ban of excommunication that had been laid upon Aversa.

===Angevins===
After the Norman dynasty Aversa declined in importance: the Angevin kings of Naples came to Aversa mostly to hunt and hold court in the citadel, of which a few traces remain in via Roma in Aversa&#x27;s historic centre. In particular Queen Joanna I chose Aversa for her preferred seat. There a group of nobles threw her husband Andrew from a window with a rope around his neck. His brother, King Louis I of Hungary, head of the Capetian House of Anjou, marched into Italy and at Aversa took his vengeance at a banquet of reconciliation, as Joanna escaped to Avignon.

The presence of the court also benefitted Aversa by the institution of the Real Casa dell&#x27;Annunziata (about 1315) an orphanage and hospice that occupied a central place in Aversan public life.

===Crown of Aragon===
When Alfonso V of Aragon permanently enthroned the kingdom of Naples within the domains of the Crown of Aragon, Aversa continued to maintain the privileges it had enjoyed. Soon the epidemics and subdivisions of land caused it to be relegated as a peripheral urban center of Naples.

===Fifteenth century===
In the fourteenth or fifteenth century the County of Aversa was taken over by a family from Valencia, the Pròixida. In fact, the palace of the Count of Almenara in Almenara (Castellón) is also known as the palace of the Count of Aversa.

==Demographics==
==Gastronomy==
===Aversa DOC===
Italian wine, both white and sparkling, under the Aversa DOC appellation comes from this area. Grapes destined for DOC product must be harvested to a maximum yield of 14 tonnes/hectare with the finished wines fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 10.5% for still and 11% for the &quot;spumante&quot; style.

The primary grape variety of the region is the Asprinio which must constitute at least 85% of the wines, with other local white grape varieties, such as Fiano, Trebbiano and Greco permitted to fill in the remainder. Viticulture in Aversa is unique for its use of growing the grapevines with poplar trees acting as trellises. This traditional method of trellising means that almost all harvesting is done by hand.

==Main sights==
Aversa, the second in historic importance of the dioceses of Campania, is the &quot;city of a hundred churches&quot; in its extensive historic center. Among its monuments:

*The Romanesque Duomo, dedicated to Saint Paul, has a spectacular ambulatory and a majestic octagonal dome. Francesco Solimena&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Gonfalone&quot;and the Quattrocento painter Angiolillo Arcuccio&#x27;s &quot;Martyrdom of St Sebastian&quot; are in the Duomo. The pre-Romanesque sculpture of St George and the Dragon is one of the few surviving free-standing sculptures of its date. An outstanding collection of Baroque liturgical silver is kept in the Treasury.
*The Baroque &quot;Church of San Francesco delle Monache&quot;.
*The &quot;Ospedale Psichiatrico Santa Maria Maddalena&quot; founded by Joachim Murat in 1813 which was the oldest Judicial Psychiatric Hospital in Italy and the center of many accusations of abuse.
*The &quot;Real Casa dell&#x27;Annunziata&quot;.
*The Benedictine Abbey of &quot;San Lorenzo&quot;, founded in the 10th century, with a fine Renaissance cloister.
*The Church of &quot;Santa Maria a Piazza&quot;, founded in the 10th century, has frescoes of the school of Giotto.
*Other churches in the city conserve paintings by Guido da Siena, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Marco Pino da Siena, Pietro da Cortona, Pietro Negroni &quot;il Giovane Zingaro&quot;, Giuseppe Ribera, Cornelius Smeet, Abram Vink, Teodoro d&#x27;Errico, Francesco de Mura, Massimo Stanzione, and Paolo de Maio.
*The Historic Former Railway station (Stazione Ferrovia Napoli Piedimonte D&#x27;Alife) of a long closed 1913 railway
*The Historic Aragonese Castle which now houses the Italian Penitentiary Police (Italy&#x27;s Correction Officers) training facility

==Transportation==
Aversa railway station is a major station on the Rome–Formia–Naples railway. Most of the traffic is operated by Trenitalia, although some trains run under the aegis of MetroCampania NordEst (successor to the former Ferrovia Alifana).

<text>The NZ South Island Party was a New Zealand regionalist political party, advocating greater representational say for the South Island. The party is no longer registered. Its aims were for the establishment of a regional assembly to handle issues relating directly to the South Island.

The party was based in the Otago region, and led by Dunedin publican Pat McCarrigan and former trade unionist Alan McDonald. It was not effective in achieving a wide acclaim, poor organisation and lack of financial resources probably being to blame. In the 1999 elections, the party put forward five electorate candidates and seven list candidates.

The party won no seats in 1999. It received 0.14% of the party vote (2,622 votes in total), and its highest percentage of the party vote in any seat was 1.5%. Its best showing in any electorate was to receive 2.6% of the electorate vote (over 800 votes).

The party&#x27;s registration was cancelled at its own request on 14 June 2002, and it did not contest the 2002 elections.

The South Island Independence movement is not a political party in its own right and may not be considered as being connected with the South Island Party, but its aims are generally regarded as being closely linked with those expressed by the South Island Party.

<text>Caroline Middleton Benn (née DeCamp; 13 October 1926 – 22 November 2000), formerly Viscountess Stansgate, was a British educationalist and writer, and wife of Labour politician Tony Benn (formerly 2nd Viscount Stansgate).

==Biography==
Benn was born Caroline Middleton DeCamp in Cincinnati, Ohio, the eldest daughter of Anne Hetherington (&quot;née&quot; Graydon) and James Milton DeCamp, a Cincinnati lawyer. 

Educated at Vassar College (AB, 1946) and the University of Cincinnati (BA, 1948), she travelled to the United Kingdom in 1948 to study at Oxford University and voted for Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party candidate in that year&#x27;s American Presidential election. She earned an English MA on Jacobean drama (specifically on the masques of Inigo Jones) at University College London in 1951.

She met Tony Benn over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1948, and just nine days later he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of their house in Holland Park. In June 1999, on their golden wedding anniversary, she put on the red striped dress she had worn that night. The couple had four children: Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua – and ten grandchildren.

She devoted her life to comprehensive education and was co-founder of the Campaign for Comprehensive Education. She sent her own children to Holland Park School, one of the first comprehensive schools in the country. In 1970, she wrote alongside Professor Brian Simon, &quot;Halfway There&quot; – the definitive study of the progress of comprehensive reform in the UK. This was followed up in 1997 with &quot;Thirty Years On&quot;, which she co-wrote with Prof. Clyde Chitty.

As well as writing extensively about education, Benn held a number of other positions: she was a member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1970 to 1977, an ILEA Governor at Imperial College London, a tutor at the Open University, a lecturer at Kensington and Hammersmith Further Education College from 1970 to 1996, a governor of Holland Park School for thirty-five years (serving from 1971 to 1983 as Chair, under the headship of Derek Rushworth), and president of the Socialist Education Association.

Benn played a significant role in her husband&#x27;s political career, earning popularity among his colleagues who respected her views, which were often more radical than Benn&#x27;s. She is personally credited with having suggested the title of the Labour Party manifesto for the 1964 general election. She proposed &quot;The New Britain&quot;, and it eventually became &quot;Let&#x27;s Go With Labour for the New Britain&quot;.

In 1964 she was secretary of the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy? Committee&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

==Death==
Benn was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 1996, having been unwell for about a year, but fought the illness for several further years. She became increasingly frail during 2000, having developed spinal metastases, and died at Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 22 November 2000, aged 74.

==Tribute==
&quot;A Tribute to Caroline Benn: Education and Democracy&quot;, edited by her daughter and Clyde Chitty, was published in 2004, featuring essays on her life and on educational reform and her life&#x27;s work.

His cartoon style was a single topical highly detailed panel, usually with a great deal more going on than the single joke. Certain recurring characters achieved a great deal of popularity, particularly the extended Giles family, which first appeared in a published cartoon on 5 August 1945 and featured prominently in the strip.

==Early life==
Giles was born in Islington, London, the son of a tobacconist and a farmer&#x27;s daughter. He was nicknamed &quot;Karlo&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Carl&quot;, by friends who decided he looked like Boris Karloff, a lifelong nickname. He was actually registered with that name when he died in 1995. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked as an office boy for Superads, an advertising agency that commissioned animated films from cartoonists like Brian White and Sid Griffiths&#x27; animation company also based in Charing Cross Road, London from 1929. When Superads closed in 1931, he gained experience in other small film companies in the area before being promoted to an animator in 1935, beginning to work for producer Alexander Korda on a colour cartoon film, &quot;The Fox Hunt&quot;. Giles then went to Ipswich to join Roland Davies, who was setting up a studio to produce animated versions of his popular newspaper strip &quot;Come On Steve&quot;. Six ten-minute films were produced, beginning with &quot;Steve Steps Out&quot; (1936), but even though Giles was the head animator, he received no screen credit.

==Career==
In 1937, Giles started work as a cartoonist for the left-wing Sunday newspaper &quot;Reynolds News&quot;, for which he drew a weekly topical cartoon and a comic strip, &quot;Young Ernie&quot;. His strip came to the attention of the editor of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; and in 1943 he was interviewed for a job on the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, but was eventually offered a job on the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot; instead, at a higher salary of 20 guineas per week, and he quit &quot;Reynolds News&quot;. His first cartoon for his new employers appeared in the 3 October 1943 edition of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;.

Giles later said that he never agreed with the &quot;Daily Express&quot;″s politics, and felt guilt for abandoning the more left-wing &quot;Reynolds News&quot; for it, but it made him wealthy: by 1955 he was being paid £8,060 per annum (equivalent to about £200,000 at 2018 prices) for producing three cartoons a week.

Giles was rejected for war service for being blind in one eye and deaf in one ear following a motorcycle accident, but made animated shorts for the Ministry of Information, while some of his cartoons were reprinted in poster form for the Railway Executive Committee and others. In 1945 he became the &quot;Daily Express&quot;″s &quot;War Correspondent Cartoonist&quot; with the 2nd Army.

At one point during World War II he was assigned as War Correspondent to the Coldstream Guards unit which liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Giles interviewed the camp commandant, Josef Kramer, who turned out to be aware of and an admirer of Giles&#x27;s work. Kramer gave Giles his Walther P38 pistol and holster, a ceremonial dagger, and his swastika armband, in return asking for a signed original of Giles&#x27;s work. Giles said:
:I have to say, that I quite liked the man. I am ashamed to say such a thing. But had I not been able to see what was happening outside the window I would have said he was very civilised. Odd, isn&#x27;t it? But maybe there was a rather dishonourable reason. I have always found it difficult to dislike someone who was an admirer of my work. And strangely, Kramer was. I never sent him an original. What was the point? He had been hanged.

The pistol and armband as well as the whip carried by Irma Grese were later given by Giles to a private collector in Suffolk.

In 1959 he was awarded an OBE. Among his fans were the British royal family, who often requested the originals of his work.

Giles&#x27;s cartoons feature many references to news items, some even quoting a news headline. The topics were typically British and made references to common British goods or attitudes. For example, a cartoon published in 1985 involves a cleaner who has &quot;left her box of Persil just behind the throne&quot; and knocks to be let back in to get it, upon which she is mistaken for Black Rod.

Giles finally quit working for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1989; his cartoons had been allocated less and less space in the newspaper, and he said that the last straw was being stood up following a trip to London to lunch with the editor. He continued working for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; until 1991.

He never sold any of his creations, preferring to donate them to friends and to charitable organisations, like the RNLI, of which he was Life President, and which continues to issue charity Christmas cards each year bearing his work.

He also contributed cartoons to &quot;Men Only&quot; and other publications, drew advertising cartoons for Guinness, Fisons and other companies, and designed Christmas cards for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and Game Conservancy Research Fund.

==Personal life==
Giles married Sylvia &#x27;Joan&#x27; Clarke, his first cousin, on 14 March 1942 in East Finchley. The couple never had children but were married for over 50 years and shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Witnesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, where they spent the rest of their lives together. The last decade of Giles&#x27;s life was plagued with failing health, including sight loss and encroaching deafness, and in 1990 he suffered the amputation of both legs due to poor circulation issues. He was reported to have never got over the death of his wife, on Christmas Day 1994, and died himself just over eight months later at Ipswich Hospital on 27 August 1995 aged 78.

The graves of Giles and his wife are located in the churchyard of St Martin&#x27;s church in Tuddenham St Martin, Suffolk.

==Annual collections of cartoons==

Collections of Giles&#x27;s cartoons have been produced annually since 1946.

Up until the 50th collection (published in 1996), they were given the title &quot;1st Series&quot;, &quot;2nd Series&quot;, up to &quot;60th Series&quot; (2007), although since the 1997-published collection, they have been called &quot;The 1998 collection&quot;, &quot;The 1999 collection&quot;, etc. For reasons unknown the 2005 Collection was subtitled as 56th series, despite the 2003 edition being correctly titled as such and the 2005 release actually being the 58th book.

Until his death in 1995, Giles selected which cartoons would be in the annual.

Up until 1991, when Giles stopped producing new cartoons, the annual consisted of cartoons from the preceding year — for example, in the 42nd series (published in autumn 1989), the cartoons used were originally published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot; between 30 June 1987 and 12 June 1988.

From 1991, the annuals consisted of cartoons previously published in collections, although some previously unpublished in annuals were included. The 46th series (1992), 47th (1993) and the 1999–2001 collections are all composed solely of cartoons which had not previously been published in any other collection. The 2002–2006 collections included some cartoons not previously published in any collections.

The 1999–2005 collections included a calendar, with twelve cartoons from the year&#x27;s collection.

==Celebrity fans==
Most of the annuals included a foreword from an editor of the Express newspapers or a celebrity fan, including Margot Fonteyn (ballet dancer), Adam Faith (singer), Spike Milligan (comedian), Sir Malcolm Sargent (conductor), Jim Clark (F1 champion), Sean Connery (actor), Frank Sinatra (singer) and Tommy Cooper (comedian and magician).

The 2010 collection had an introduction about Giles, as it was the first year that Hamlyn had published the collection (all previous collections had been published by Express Newspapers). The 2011 collection returned to the tradition of having an introduction written by a celebrity fan (in that case, Lee Latchford-Evans) and the majority of the cartoons featured in the 2011 collection had never previously appeared in an annual.

In June 2017, Dr Tim Benson published the first biography of Giles to be based on the cartoonist&#x27;s own correspondence in his book &#x27;Giles&#x27;s War&#x27;. Benson discovered that Giles had been dishonest about his reasons for leaving Reynolds News due to the guilt he felt over joining Express Newspapers. The book also discusses how Peter Tory had written a ‘dreadful&#x27; book about the cartoonist which was not helped by the fact that the two men loathed each other, while Tory had missed out much of the story of Giles&#x27; career and relationships.

==Influences==
Giles cited his influences as Bruce Bairnsfather and Graham Laidler (&quot;Pont&quot;), and he himself influenced the style of the newspaper cartoonists &quot;JAK&quot; and &quot;Mac&quot;. Giles&#x27; cartoon &#x27;Back to School Week&#x27; of 13 January 1953 inspired Leo Baxendale to create the &quot;Bash Street Kids&quot; for the &quot;Beano&quot; comic.

In April 2000, he was voted &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite Cartoonist of the 20th Century&quot; by visitors to The Cartoon Museum between February and April 2000, also coming second (to Ronald Searle) in a poll amongst cartoonists.

==Tributes==

In 1993 a bronze statue depicting Grandma looking up at the window of the studio in Ipswich where he used to work was unveiled by Warren Mitchell. Giles, who was by this time using a wheelchair, was present at the unveiling.

He lived in Witnesham and supported Ipswich Town (as shown by cartoons where Grandma is wearing an Ipswich Town scarf).

<doc id="1118247" wikidata="Q1141728" url="?curid=1118247" title="International Christian University">
<text>is a non-denominational private university located in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, commonly known as ICU. With the efforts of Prince Takamatsu, General Douglas MacArthur, and BOJ President Hisato Ichimada, ICU was established in 1949 as the first liberal arts college in Japan. Currently the university offers 31 undergraduate majors and a graduate school. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology selected ICU as one of the 37 schools for The Top Global University Project in 2014.

ICU is known for being a fully bilingual campus, the classes are held in either English or Japanese, with all faculty required to have strong command in both languages. ICU is a member of the Alliance of Asian Liberal Arts Universities.

==Institution==
===History===
ICU was founded in 1949. With an emphasis on reconciliation and peace, ICU was envisaged as a &quot;University of Tomorrow&quot;, a place where Japanese and international students would live together and learn to serve the needs of an emerging, more interconnected world. When students enter ICU they sign the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and they are challenged to commit themselves to help bring about social justice and world peace. Due to this commitment to human rights, Eleanor Roosevelt delivered ICU&#x27;s first convocation address.

According to JICUF (Japan ICU Foundation), 
Concerted fundraising campaigns were initiated in both Japan and in North America. Hisato Ichimada, the Governor of the Bank of Japan who was Buddhist, headed the Japan campaign that raised the funds necessary to purchase a large tract of land for the university. The Honorary Chair of the US fundraising campaign was General Douglas MacArthur, and the North American public responded with generous contributions as well.

The third son of the Emperor Taishō, a younger brother of the Emperor Shōwa and an uncle of the Emperor Akihito Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu officiated the Honorary President of the Preparatory Committee for founding ICU.

==Campus==
ICU&#x27;s main campus of 150 wooded acres is located in Western Tokyo, with downtown areas like Shinjuku about half an hour&#x27;s train ride away. Computer and internet access is available throughout the campus.

The campus sits on ancient pre-Jomon and Jomon archaeological remains, which gives students the opportunity to participate in archaeological fieldwork. Excavated items found on the campus are on permanent display in the . In addition, the campus is directly on the former location of a Nakajima Aircraft Company factory.

In a quiet wooded area of the campus and through a large thatched gate is the Taizanso Garden. Built in the 1920s, the garden includes a traditional Japanese tea house and the historically significant One-Mat Room constructed out of wood gathered from sacred and historic sites throughout Japan.

ICU owns a campus in Nasu and a retreat center in Karuizawa, Kitasaku District, Nagano Prefecture.

ICU houses a Rotary Center for peace and conflict resolution, partnering with Rotary International. It is the only Rotary Peace Center giving graduate degrees in Asia and is only one of seven Peace Centers worldwide. The University of California Tokyo Study Center which hosts the UCEAP program to Japan is also located on ICU campus.

==Academics==

ICU offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in liberal arts fields, as well as master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in education, public administration, comparative culture and the natural sciences. About 18% of the faculty come from overseas (primarily English-speaking countries). There is a strong English language program (ELP), taught by tenured and contract faculty English teachers, which was embroiled in a contentious curricular reform in 2010 leading to the name being changed to the ELA (English for Liberal Arts program) in April 2012. Academics who aspire to teach at ICU are required to submit a reference who can testify to their commitment to Christianity, despite the university&#x27;s stance that increasing adherents to the Christian faith is not its primary goal.

=== Bilingual academics ===
The languages of instruction at ICU are Japanese and English. Around 30% of all courses are offered in English, the rest in Japanese or in both languages.

Prospective students without prior Japanese language knowledge are able to apply under a documentary screening process, instead of undergoing the entrance exams held in Japanese. These students are required to have college level English proficiency and subsequently take ICU Japanese Language Programs (JLP) courses to gain bilingualism and eventually take courses taught in Japanese.

Under the policy of bilingualism of ICU curriculum, students take language courses for their non-dominant language in their freshman and sophomore year (Depending on the student&#x27;s language requirements, English for Liberal Arts or Japanese Language Programs).

Each campus department staffs employees with strong command in both languages. Student resources, ICU websites, and campus bulletin boards are in both Japanese and English to accommodate students from any language background.

=== Trimester system ===
The academic year is divided into trimesters of approximately eleven weeks each with each course lasting one trimester term. This allows for a dynamic learning experience, one where students can design their own curricula as their interests change and develop.

===Japan ICU Foundation===
The Japan ICU Foundation (JICUF) was incorporated in New York State on November 23, 1948, and helped to establish ICU in 1953. Today, the foundation maintains two non-profit corporations: The Japan ICU Foundation, Inc. and the JICUF Endowment, Inc.

The Japan ICU Foundation supports ICU in a variety of ways, including providing scholarships, running a faculty exchange program, providing funding for international programs and projects and helping to fund new buildings on campus. The Foundation has offices in New York City. The current Executive Director of JICUF is Paul Hastings.

== Research institutes ==
ICU has eight research institutes as of 2016. In addition to research, these institutes plan and sponsor conferences, lectures, symposia and seminars as well as provide students with opportunities to meet distinguished scholars from Japan and overseas.

As of 2011, ICU had 2851 undergraduates studying in the College of Liberal Arts, with 1041 male students and 1810 female students. The ICU Graduate School had 150 students, with 64 men and 86 women. 90.5% of ICU&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate students are Japanese citizens, and the remainder represent 44 countries. Many returnee Japanese students that have lived overseas, also known as kikokushijo (帰国子女), make up the student body.

The majority of ICU students live off-campus, either at home with their families or in apartments. As of 2010, about 600 students were living on campus.

=== International Education Exchange Programs ===
More than half of the students participate in study abroad programs during their time at ICU. The percentage of students who study abroad through ICU programs before they graduate is 55.5% (in 2014). Students who come from abroad to study at ICU on a year-long exchange program are referred to as OYRs (One Year Regulars).

===ICU Dining Hall===
The ICU Dining Hall, also known as , is the official cafeteria of International Christian University. Rebuilt in 2010, Gakki is a public, self-service cafeteria and is one of the newest buildings on campus.

===Student clubs/circles===
ICU students are known for their remarkable energy and initiative in creating a kaleidoscope of student-led and student-managed co-curricular activities. There are about 100 student-led clubs and organizations in the arts, sports, academic and social fields. New clubs are formed as student interest dictates, and most ICU students participate in one or more of these organizations.

=== After graduation ===
As of 2016, 95.3% of ICU undergraduate alumni (students seeking employment) land a job right after graduation. ICU students have found employment in a wide range of industries, particularly with global companies.

Over 20% of students go on to graduate school overseas and in Japan. Domestic and Overseas Universities include: International Christian University, University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Hitotsubashi University, University of Oxford, Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of London, and Harvard University.

<text>Random House Webster&#x27;s Unabridged Dictionary is a large American dictionary, first published in 1966 as &quot;The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: The Unabridged Edition&quot;. Edited by Editor-in-chief Jess Stein, it contained 315,000 entries in 2256 pages, as well as 2400 illustrations. The CD-ROM version in 1994 also included 120,000 spoken pronunciations.

==History==
The Random House publishing company entered the reference book market after World War II. They acquired rights to the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of American English&quot;, both out of print. Their first dictionary was Clarence Barnhart&#x27;s &quot;American College Dictionary&quot;, published in 1947, and based primarily on &quot;The New Century Dictionary&quot;, an abridgment of the &quot;Century&quot;.

In the late 1950s, it was decided to publish an expansion of the &quot;American College Dictionary&quot;, which had been modestly updated with each reprinting since its publication. Under editors Jess Stein and Laurence Urdang, they augmented the &quot;American College Dictionary&quot; with large numbers of entries in all fields, primarily proper names, and published it in 1966 as &quot;The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: The Unabridged Edition&quot;. It was the first dictionary to use computers in its compilation and typesetting.

In his preface to the 1966 edition, Stein wrote (p. vi) that the &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot; steers &quot;a linguistically sound middle course&quot; between the &quot;lexicographer&#x27;s Scylla and Charybdis: should the dictionary be an authoritarian guide to &#x27;correct&#x27; English or should it be so antiseptically free of comment that it may defeat the user by providing him with no guidance at all?&quot; In 1982 Random House published The Random House ProofReader, a computer spell checker based on its dictionary.

An expanded second edition of the printed dictionary, edited by Stuart Berg Flexner, appeared in 1987, revised in 1993. This edition adopted the &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate&quot; practice of adding dates for the entry of words into the language. Unlike the &quot;Collegiate&quot;, which cited the date of the first known citation, &quot;Random House&quot; indicated a range of dates. For example, where the &quot;Collegiate&quot; gave 1676, &quot;Random House&quot; might offer 1670–80. This second edition was described as permissive by in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;.

Random House incorporated the name &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; into the dictionary&#x27;s title after an appeals court overturned an injunction awarded to Merriam Webster restricting the name&#x27;s use. The name &quot;Random House Webster&#x27;s&quot; is now used on many Random House publications.

In 2001, Random House published its &quot;Webster&#x27;s Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, based on the Second Edition of the &quot;Random House Dictionary of the English Language&quot;.

Versions of the dictionary have been published under other names, including &quot;Webster&#x27;s New Universal Dictionary&quot; (which was previously the name of an entirely different dictionary), &quot;Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language&quot;.

&quot;Dictionary.com&quot;″s online dictionary bases its proprietary content on the &quot;Random House&quot; unabridged version.

It was once a thriving commercial fishing village. It is the home of the former Maitland Arms Hotel, a thriving rock n&#x27; roll venue from the late 1960s to mid 1970s.

==Economy==

Port Maitland is home to International Marine Salvage. IMS was responsible for the scrapping of two Oberon-class submarines HMCS Okanagan and HMS Olympus (S12) for the Royal Canadian Navy.

<text>The Bavarian Soviet Republic (or Bavarian Council Republic), also known as the Munich Soviet Republic (), was a short-lived unrecognised socialist state in Bavaria during the German revolution of 1918–1919.

A group of communists and anarchists declared the Bavarian Soviet Republic on 6 April 1919, forcing the government of the existing People&#x27;s State of Bavaria to flee to Bamberg. The members of the new government, led by playwright Ernst Toller, had no political or administrative experience, and after just six days in power they were ousted in a putsch organized by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The new head of state, the Russian-German Bolshevik Eugen Leviné, quickly instituted communist measures such as worker control of factories. Food shortages led to popular unrest, and on 3 May the People&#x27;s State was violently put down by soldiers of the German Army, supported by paramilitary troops. Some 600 people died in the fighting, and up to 1,200 communists and anarchists were later executed.

On 14 August 1919, the democratic Free State of Bavaria was established within the Weimar Republic. The Bavarian Soviet Republic contributed to the nationwide split between the moderate and radical Left represented by the Social Democrats and the Communists, which seriously weakened opposition to the Nazi rise to power.

== Background ==
The roots of the republic lay in the German Empire&#x27;s defeat in the First World War and the ensuing German Revolution of 1918–1919. In September 1917, the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which rejected revolutionary efforts in Bavaria, had submitted a corresponding motion () to the Bavarian Landtag, which contained the main demands of the Bavarian SPD, including the abolition of the privileged first chamber of the Landtag ( in which only the nobility was represented); the abolition of the nobility as a whole; general, equal, direct and secret suffrage; more rights for the state parliament; and separation of church and state. However, this motion failed. At the end of October 1918, German sailors mutinied off the North Sea coast. After setting up a revolutionary workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council at Kiel In early November, they quickly spread the councils across Germany and with little bloodshed took power from the existing military, royal and civil authorities.

On 7 November 1918, the first anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia, King Ludwig III of Bavaria fled from the Residenz Palace in Munich with his family, and Kurt Eisner, a politician of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), became of a newly-proclaimed People&#x27;s State of Bavaria. The government of the People&#x27;s State was made up of the SPD, the USPD and the Bavarian Peasants&#x27; League (BB).

Though he advocated a socialist republic, Eisner distanced himself from the Russian Bolsheviks and declared that his government would protect property rights. As the new government was unable to provide basic services, Eisner&#x27;s USPD was defeated in the January 1919 election and came in sixth place. On 21 February 1919, as he was on his way to the Landtag to announce his resignation, he was shot dead by the right-wing nationalist Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, also known as Arco-Valley.

After Eisner&#x27;s assassination, the Landtag convened, and Erhard Auer, the leader of the Social Democrats and the Minister of the Interior in Eisner&#x27;s government, began to eulogize Eisner, but rumours had already begun to spread that Auer was behind the assassination. Acting on the false allegations, Alois Linder, a saloon waiter who was a fervent supporter of Eisner, shot Auer twice with a rifle and wounded him. That prompted other armed supporters of Eisner to open fire, which caused a melee that killed the conservative parliamentarian and provoked nervous breakdowns in at least two ministers. There was effectively no government in Bavaria thereafter.

Unrest and lawlessness followed. The assassination of Eisner created a martyr for the leftist cause and prompted demonstrations, the closing of the University of Munich, the kidnapping of aristocrats and the forced pealing of church bells. The support for the Left was greater than Eisner himself had been able to command.
On 1 March, the Congress of Councils proclaimed a new government under Martin Segitz, but it was neither recognised by the majority of the state parliament and nor politically active. On 17 March 1919, the Socialists&#x27; new leader, Johannes Hoffmann, an anti-militarist and former schoolteacher, patched together a parliamentary coalition government

However, a month later, on the night of 6–7 April, communists and anarchists, energized by the news of a communist revolution in Hungary, declared a Soviet republic, with Ernst Toller as chief of state. Toller called on the non-existent &quot;Bavarian Red Army&quot; to support the new dictatorship of the proletariat and ruthlessly deal with any counter-revolutionary behaviour. The KPD reluctantly took part in the newly-formed soviet republic though the party&#x27;s chairman, Paul Levi, denounced the republic as &quot;revolutionary adventurism&quot;.

The Hoffmann government fled to Bamberg, in northern Bavaria, which it declared the new seat of government.

== First Ernst Toller government ==
Initially, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was ruled by USPD members such as Ernst Toller, and anarchists like writer Gustav Landauer, economist Silvio Gesell, and playwright Erich Mühsam. Toller, who was also a playwright, described the revolution as the &quot;Bavarian Revolution of Love&quot;. Among the café society of Schwabing, the new government became known as &quot;the regime of the coffeehouse anarchists.&quot;

Toller&#x27;s cabinet picks were controversial. For instance, a burglar with a conviction for moral turpitude was chosen as police president of Munich. Most infamous was the Commissar of Foreign Affairs Dr. Franz Lipp – who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals – declared war on Württemberg and Switzerland over the Swiss refusal to lend 60 locomotives to the Republic. He claimed to be well acquainted with Pope Benedict XV and informed Vladimir Lenin and the Pope by cable that the ousted former Minister-President Hoffmann had fled to Bamberg and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.

Toller&#x27;s brief government was characterized by bold declarations without real enforcement. The minister for public housing published a decree saying that no house could thereafter contain more than three rooms and that the living room must always be above the kitchen and bedroom. It was also declared that Finance Minister Silvio Gesell&#x27;s concept of Freigeld would be implemented, although it never was.

Members of the Toller cabinet included:

== Eugen Leviné government ==

On Saturday 12 April 1919, only six days into Toller&#x27;s regime, the KPD seized power, led by three Russian-German Bolsheviks, with Eugen Leviné as head of state and Max Levien as the chairman of the Bavarian KPD. The communists managed to secure power after the so called Palm Sunday Putsch, where the counter-revolutionary government forces were suppressed by the Bavarian Red Army commander Rudolf Egelhofer. Erich Mühsam, a member of the Toller Government, had himself &quot;suggested to Leviné that we [the Toller government] be forcibly ousted so that the hopeless situation would end and the revolutionary work could be secured.&quot;

Having received the blessings of Lenin – who at the annual May Day celebration in Red Square said: &quot;The liberated working class is celebrating its anniversary not only in Soviet Russia but in ... Soviet Bavaria&quot; – Leviné began to enact more communist reforms, which included forming a &quot;Red Army&quot; from factory workers, seizing cash, food supplies, and privately owned guns, expropriating luxurious apartments and giving them to the homeless and placing factories under the ownership and control of their workers. One of Munich&#x27;s main churches was taken over and made into a revolutionary temple which would be presided over by &quot;Goddess Reason.&quot; Bavaria was to be in the vanguard of the Bolshevization of central Europe, with all workers to receive military training.

Leviné also had plans to abolish paper money and reform the education system but never had time to implement them. There was time, however, for Max Levien, following Lenin&#x27;s orders, to arrest aristocrats and members of the middle-class as hostages.

During Leviné&#x27;s short reign, food shortages quickly became a problem, especially the absence of milk. Public criticism over the milk shortage turned political, precipitating the communist government to publicly declare: &quot;What does it matter? ... Most of it goes to the children of the bourgeoisie anyway. We are not interested in keeping them alive. No harm if they die – they&#x27;d only grow into enemies of the proletariat.&quot;

An attempt by troops loyal to the Hoffmann government and the paramilitary (combat league) of the Neopagan and Thule Society to overthrow the BSR on 13 April was put down by the new Red Army, which consisted of factory workers and members of the soldiers&#x27; and workers&#x27; councils. Twenty men died in the fighting.

== Second Ernst Toller government ==
On 27 April, due to disputes over whether negotiations should be held with Hoffmann&#x27;s People&#x27;s State of Bavaria, Leviné&#x27;s committee resigned and re-elected Toller to lead the Bavarian Soviet Republic.

== Military clash and demise ==
The rival governments – Hoffmann&#x27;s People&#x27;s State of Bavaria seated in Bamberg, and the Bavarian Soviet Republic located in Munich – clashed militarily at Dachau on 18 April when Hoffmann&#x27;s 8,000 soldiers met the Soviet Republic&#x27;s 30,000. The BSR forces – led by Ernst Toller – were victorious in the first battle at Dachau, but Hoffmann made a deal that gave him the services of 20,000 men of the under Lt. General . Oven and the , along with Hoffmann&#x27;s loyalist elements of the German Army – called the &quot;White Guards of Capitalism&quot; by the communists – then took Dachau and surrounded Munich. Supporters of the BSR had, in the meantime, on 26 April, occupied the rooms of the Thule Society in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten, and arrested Countess Hella von Westarp, the society&#x27;s secretary, and six others, to be held as hostages. Rudolf Egelhofer, panicked by Munich being surrounded by Hoffmann&#x27;s forces, had these seven and three other hostages executed on 30 April. They included the well-connected Prince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis. The executions were carried out despite Toller&#x27;s efforts to prevent them.

The broke through the Munich defences on 1 May, leading to bitter street fighting that involved &quot;flame-throwers, heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, even aircraft&quot;. At least 606 people were killed, of whom 335 were civilians. Leviné was later condemned to death for treason, and shot by a firing squad in Stadelheim Prison. Gustav Landauer was killed by the , and Egelhofer was murdered without trial after being arrested as well. Numerous others were given prison sentences, such as Toller (5 years) and the anarchist writer Erich Mühsam (15 years); others received longer sentences, 6,000 years&#x27; worth in all, some of it to hard labour.

After the execution of 1,000–1,200 suspected communists, Oven declared the city to have been secured on 6 May, ending the reign of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Although the Hoffmann government was nominally restored, the actual power in Munich had shifted to the right.

The was enacted on 14 August 1919, creating the Free State of Bavaria within the new Weimar Republic.

== Aftermath ==
After the Bavarian Soviet Republic was crushed, the SPD returned to power, but was subsequently ousted in the Kapp Putsch in March 1920. The tumultuous period of the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria and the Bavarian Soviet Republic was used by conservative and far-right circles to stoke fear and hatred of &quot;bolshevism&quot; among Bavarian society. The period was popularly remembered as a period in which both states existed as one of shortages, censorship, restrictions on freedom, violence, and general disorder. The many separate strands of Bavarian conservatism found a common enemy in the far-left, and the former Kingdom became profoundly &quot;reactionary, anti-Republican, [and] counter-revolutionary.&quot;

The Communists and Social Democrats both blamed each other following the episode, paralyzing the left through the Nazi era.

The fact that some of the prominent figures of the People&#x27;s State and the Soviet Republic were Jewish was used by conservative and far-right circles to push the conspiracy theory of &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; in Bavaria.

== Notable people ==
One notable supporter of the Soviet Republic was the artist Georg Schrimpf, then aged 30, who was arrested when the movement was crushed. His friend, the writer Oskar Maria Graf, who was also arrested, wrote about the events in his autobiographical novel, &quot;Wir sind Gefangene&quot; (1927). The famed anarchist novelist Ret Marut (later known as B.Traven) was an active participant in the establishment of Soviet power and worked as head of the Press Department of the Soviet Republic. During the early days of the Soviet Republic, representatives of cultural life also played an important role in the revolution. Some intellectuals such as the economist Lujo Brentano, the conductor Bruno Walter and the writers Heinrich Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke formed the (Council of Intellectual Work) with Mann as its chairman&quot;.&quot;

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s longstanding chauffeur and first leader of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) Julius Schreck signed up and served as a member of the Red Army in late April 1919. Balthasar Brandmayer, one of Hitler&#x27;s closest wartime friends, remarked &quot;how he at first welcomed the end of the monarchies&quot; and the establishment of the republic in Bavaria.

Hitler himself acted as a liaison between his army battalion – he had been elected &quot;deputy battalion representative&quot; – and the Soviet Republic&#x27;s Department of Propaganda by soldiers who mostly supported the mainstream SPD as opposed to the more radical USPD. Both newsreel film footage and a still photograph show Hitler marching in Eisner&#x27;s funeral procession. He wears both a black mourning band and a red band showing support for the Government. It is uncertain whether this indicated that Hitler was a true supporter of the Soviet Republic, or that he was simply taking an available opportunity not to return to his impoverished pre-war civilian life. Befitting what is now known about his character, Hitler&#x27;s so-called left-wing politics may have been purely opportunistic, rather than reflecting a deeper political belief. It is also known that once the Soviet Republic had fallen to the White Guard and the , Hitler immediately changed his loyalties, aligning himself with the Weimar Republic and – as part of a three-man committee assigned to investigate the behavior of his regiment&#x27;s soldiers – informed on other soldiers who had shown sympathy for the Soviet Government.

Active participants in the units – those of Oven, Franz Ritter von Epp, and Hermann Erhardt – that suppressed the Bavarian Soviet Republic included future powerful members of the Nazi Party, including Rudolf Hess, a member of the .

== Legacy ==
In his 1952 memoir &quot;Witness&quot;, Whittaker Chambers named Eugene Leviné as one of three people whom he most admired as he joined the Communist Party USA, along with Felix Dzerzhinsky and Igor Sazonov:

<text>A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles (DAE) is a dictionary of terms appearing in English in the United States that was published in four volumes from 1938 to 1944 by the University of Chicago Press. Intended to pick up where the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; left off, it covers American English words and phrases in use from the first English settlements up to the start of the 20th century.

==History==
The work was begun in 1925 by William A. Craigie. The first volume appeared in 1936 under the editorship of Craigie and James R. Hulbert, a professor of English at the University of Chicago. The four volume edition was completed with the help of George Watson and Allen Walker Read. The group referenced early literature depicting American regional accents, including three novels by John Neal: &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; (1825), &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828), and &quot;The Down-Easters, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&quot; (1833).

The work was one of the sources for the &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot;, c. 1952, prepared under the direction of Mitford Mathews. A similar, but unrelated modern work, the &quot;Dictionary of American Regional English,&quot; has been compiled to show dialect variation.

<doc id="1118285" wikidata="Q2934754" url="?curid=1118285" title="Camerica">
<text>Camerica was a Canadian video game company founded in 1988. It released various unlicensed video games and accessories for the Nintendo Entertainment System, such as the Game Genie, and was the North American publisher for British developer Codemasters.

==History==
The company was owned and operated by David J. Harding and was originally formed in 1988 as a wholesale association with giftware such as Waterford Crystal and Blue Mountain Pottery.

The company entered the video game market, featuring Nintendo World Championship of 1990 winner Thor Aackerlund as the spokesperson, considered one of the first professional gamers. Camerica held the rights to publish most Nintendo Entertainment System games from Codemasters in North America. Camerica also released the Codemasters-designed Game Genie in Canada and the UK. They had a distribution deal with toy company Galoob. The company created several early peripherals for the NES, including the Aladdin Deck Enhancer expansion peripheral and Supersonic: the Joystick a.k.a. Turbotronic, a wireless controller.

Camerica was notable for being an unlicensed distributor, reverse engineering cartridges that would bypass Nintendo&#x27;s 10NES lock-out chip. Like the circuit used in Color Dreams cartridges, Camerica&#x27;s workaround generates glitch pulses that freeze the lock-out chip. These cartridges are shaped and colored slightly differently from Nintendo&#x27;s official cartridges, though they still fit in the NES. All Camerica cartridges were originally produced gold-colored, and later silver. 

In &quot;Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc&quot;, Galoob, distributor of Camerica products in the United States, was ruled not an infringer of the Copyright Act because the Game Genie was not a derivative work and was protected by fair use.

In &quot;Nintendo of America Inc. v. Camerica Corp&quot; (1991), it was held that it did not violate Nintendo&#x27;s trademark for Camerica to advertise compatibility with the NES despite being an unlicensed distributor.

Camerica declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1993.

<doc id="1118292" wikidata="Q278042" url="?curid=1118292" title="Upper Styria">
<text>Upper Styria (), in the Austrian usage of the term, refers exclusively to the northwestern, generally mountainous and well-wooded half of the federal state of Styria. The southeastern half of the state around the capital of Graz is known as Central Styria (&quot;Mittelsteiermark&quot;), which is further divided into Eastern and Western Styria (east and west of Graz).

==Geography==
Upper Styria is separated from Central Styria by the Stubalpe and Gleinalpe ranges of the Lavanttal Alps, and the Prealps East of the Mur. It is a generally rural region characterized by agriculture and tourism, except for the area between the towns of Judenburg and Mürzzuschlag, in the valley formed by the rivers Mur and Mürz, with extensive industrial sites. The area around Altaussee in the far northwest is part of the Austrian Salzkammergut cultural landscape.

The &quot;Obersteiermark&quot; region consists of five districts:
*Murau
*Liezen
*Murtal (former Judenburg and Knittelfeld)
*Leoben

==Usage in Slovenia==

In Slovenian usage, the term Upper Styria (&quot;Zgornja Štajerska&quot;) refers to the whole Austrian state of Styria—as opposed to the traditional region called Lower Styria (&quot;Spodnja Štajerska&quot;), Slovenian Styria (&quot;Slovenska Štajerska&quot;) or just Styria (&quot;Štajerska&quot;), the southern third of the former Duchy of Styria which after World War I was allotted to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint Germain and is today part of Slovenia.

<doc id="1118293" wikidata="Q949369" url="?curid=1118293" title="Funky house">
<text>Funky house is a subgenre of house music that uses disco and funk samples, a funk-inspired bass line or a strong soul influence, combined with drum breaks that draw inspiration from 1970s and 1980s funk records. It often includes disco strings, though not consistently. Recognized by its specific sound, Funky house is characterized by basslines, swooshes, swirls, and other synthesized sounds which give the music a bouncy tempo. Overall, it has influenced the development of several other subgenres, such as tech house, nu-disco, and UK Funky, which have borrowed its rhythmic elements and upbeat energy.

== Production and characteristics ==
Funky house music draws inspiration from the rhythmic complexity and soulful vibe of 1970s and 1980s funk and disco. Key production characteristics include disco strings, funk inspired basslines, vocal samples, and tempo and synth effects.

A description of those characteristics features a lush, orchestral disco strings that contribute to a vibrant and immersive sound. The deep, groovy basslines provide rhythmic depth, creating a compelling foundation for each track. The genre often incorporates vocal loops or samples from older soul and disco records, blending familiar elements with fresh, innovative twists. Typically produced at around 128 BPM, funky house tracks are characterized by synthesized effects such as swooshes, swirls, and filters, lending the music a bouncy, uplifting vibe that defines its unique energy.

== History ==

=== 1990s ===
Funky house gained initial popularity in the 1990s, with artists such as Daft Punk helping popularize the style through tracks like &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;One More Time&quot;. These tracks incorporated repetitive, groove-heavy basslines with soulful, filtered vocals, becoming defining features of the genre. Thomas Bangalter, a member of Daft Punk, founded the label Roulé, making a conscious effort to distinguish funky house from other house subgenres by blending classic funk with modern production techniques.

=== 2000s ===
The genre generated significant success in the early and mid-2000s. Its influence spread across global club scenes, with popular record labels such as Defected Records, Ministry of Sound, Hed Kandi, and Fierce Angel releasing compilation albums dedicated to funky house. Notable compilation series include Defected&#x27;s &quot;In the House&quot; and Hed Kandi&#x27;s &quot;Beach House.&quot; Artists like Joey Negro (Dave Lee), Armand Van Helden, and DJ Sneak played crucial roles in shaping the genre&#x27;s sound, blending funk, soul, and house into vibrant, feel-good music that resonated worldwide.

=== 2010s–present ===
With the growing interest in funk and disco in the early 2010s, a new wave of music incorporating funk and disco samples emerged. However, some argue that the evolving sound structure diverged from traditional funky house characteristics, leading to what some refer to as funk-house. At the end of the day, these titles are interchangeable. While some see this development as a misinterpretation, others believe that funky house&#x27;s influence is evident in modern deep and tech house productions. Certain modern producers have kept the tradition alive by remixing classic tracks, maintaining its relevance in contemporary club culture.

== Influence on Modern Music ==
Funky house&#x27;s influence is visible across various modern house subgenres. Its uplifting nature has become intertwined with contemporary deep house and tech house, with many producers incorporating funk-influenced basslines and disco-inspired samples. While tech house is generally less vocal-centric than funky house, it sometimes uses vocal loops or snippets reminiscent of soulful, disco-inspired samples. These vocals are usually chopped and looped, blending seamlessly into the percussive structure of tech house, maintaining the genre&#x27;s energetic feel with a driving beat prioritizing dance-floor appeal.

=== Tech house ===
Tech house often utilizes repetitive, groove-focused basslines that draw directly from funky house. However, while funky house features rich, bouncy basslines, tech house basslines are typically more restrained and minimalistic, aligning with its techno-inspired aesthetic.

A notable example of blending tech and funky house is &quot;You Little Beauty&quot; by Fisher (musician) (2019). The track incorporates soulful influences through sampled vocals reminiscent of disco-inspired funky house. The groovy bassline and upbeat energy nod to the funky house tradition, despite its classification as tech house.

Another example includes &quot;The Movement&quot; by Matroda (2020), where the song &quot;In and Out of My Life” by Adeva (1988) was sampled. Like many funky house tracks, &quot;The Movement&quot; uses vocal samples from older recordings. The vocal cuts are manipulated to add a rhythmic, chant-like quality that aligns with the disco-funk tradition of reworking older material to create something fresh and danceable. This is a key technique in both funky house and tech house, blending nostalgia with modern beats.

=== Deep house ===

Although rooted in Chicago house music from the 1980s, deep house further evolved by the 2000s. It often features disco influences, tying it to funky house through shared characteristics like distinct basslines, rhythmic grooves, and soulful sampling techniques. However, deep house usually presents these elements in a more laid-back manner. While funky house is known for its bouncy, dance-floor tempo (around 128 BPM), deep house typically has a slower tempo (115–125 BPM). This contrast allows for cross-genre remixes and collaborations, bridging the energetic vibe of funky house with deep house&#x27;s introspective ambiance.

&quot;Love Tonight&quot; by Shouse exemplifies a deep house track with a groove-focused, repetitive bassline that creates warmth and depth. The anthem-like vocals build a communal, uplifting energy often seen in funky house tracks. The call-and-response structure and harmonized vocal loops lend a familiar, soulful vibe, making it both introspective and danceable—a hallmark of both deep and funky house.

<text>Roland Penner (July 30, 1924 – May 31, 2018) was a Canadian political activist and lawyer who became a cabinet minister in the Manitoba provincial government and dean of law at the University of Manitoba.

== Education and early career ==
Penner was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Winnipeg alderman Jacob Penner (d. 1965) and Rose Shapack (d. 1970). His father was from a Mennonite background, and his mother was Jewish. He served in Europe during World War II in the Canadian artillery. At the end of the war, he earned credits at the Khaki University of Canada. He continued his education at the University of Manitoba, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949 and an LL.B. in 1961. He began working at the University of Manitoba in 1967, and became a professor in 1972. From 1972 to 1978, he was the president of Legal Aid Manitoba, and from 1979 to 1980, he was president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers. In 1949, he married Adeline (&quot;Addie&quot;) Wdoviak, and in 1982, he married Janet Kay Baldwin.

== Political career ==
Penner&#x27;s parents and his older brother Norman were active in the communist Labor-Progressive Party. In the federal election of 1953, he ran as a candidate of the party in the predominantly middle-class riding of Winnipeg South Centre. He finished a poor fourth with only 504 votes. He also ran as an LPP candidate for school trustee in the Winnipeg municipal election of 1953.

Penner left the Labour-Progressive Party in 1961, part of a mass exodus in the years following the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s secret speech on Joseph Stalin&#x27;s crimes. His brother Norman had left in 1957, while his father Jacob remained a party member. Penner completed law school and practised criminal law for several years before becoming a law professor.

In 1980, he announced that he would seek the nomination of the New Democratic Party in the riding of St. Johns in the 1981 election. There was some speculation that Penner&#x27;s communist past would damage his political ambitions, especially as Winnipeg alderman Joe Zuken had lost a mayoral election the previous year when his communist politics became an issue. Penner rejected this suggestion, however, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a fundamental difference between Joe and myself in that I&#x27;m not a member of the Communist Party. I&#x27;m a member of the NDP. [...] I was a member of the Communist Party at one time, but that&#x27;s ancient history. That was twenty years ago. It may be raised but it&#x27;s not relevant. It would ignore what I&#x27;ve been doing the last two decades.&quot; He later chose not to run in St. Johns, and sought another riding. The party wanted him to run against Progressive Party leader Sid Green in the riding of Inkster. He declined and ran instead in Fort Rouge, where he defeated incumbent Liberal June Westbury.

On November 30, 1981, Premier Howard Pawley appointed Penner to be Government House Leader, chair of the Treasury Board, and attorney general. He was also given ministerial responsibility for the Liquor Control Act on March 4, 1982, and stood down as Treasury Board Chair on July 28 of the same year. On November 4, 1983, he stood down as house leader and received the additional portfolio of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

Penner was easily re-elected in the 1986 election. He was retained as attorney general and given responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Liquor Control Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 21, 1987, Penner was named Minister of Education, while retaining responsibility for constitutional matters.

The New Democratic Party experienced a significant decline in its popularity between 1986 and 1988, and Penner lost his seat to Liberal challenger Jim Carr in the 1988 provincial election.

As attorney-general, Penner introduced Manitoba&#x27;s first human rights legislation. He also introduced freedom of information legislation and was responsible for implementing legislation requiring French language services after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province was violating its constitutional obligations. (The latter action resulted in a backlash in some parts of the province, leading to the rise of anti-bilingualism groups such as the Confederation of Regions Party.) As minister responsible for constitutional affairs, Penner also participated in negotiations for what became the Meech Lake Accord.

Although he supported abortion rights, Penner was required to uphold a decision by the Manitoba courts which prevented Henry Morgentaler from opening a private clinic in the province. Penner was also an early champion of including sexual orientation in Canada&#x27;s human rights code.

Because of his background in communist politics, Penner was for many years forbidden from entering the United States of America under the McCarran-Walter Act. Special provisions had to be made allowing him to enter America as a cabinet minister.

== After politics ==
Following his loss, Penner returned to teaching at the University of Manitoba. He taught courses in constitutional law, criminal law, labour law, evidence, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He served as a University Dean between 1989 and 1994. He wrote several works, including a number on the privacy rights of Canadians. In 1993, he openly questioned the attempts of Bob Rae&#x27;s New Democratic Party government in Ontario to restrict tenure to professors deemed to hold socially unacceptable views. He retired from teaching in 2009.

In 2010, it was revealed that Penner&#x27;s name was on a secret list of Communist sympathizers kept during the Cold War; these persons were to be watched by the RCMP and could have been detained at internment camps in the event of a national security crisis.

In 2007, Penner published &quot;A Glowing Dream: A Memoir&quot; (Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford Publishing, 2007). In 2011, he co-wrote &quot;They Shoot Doctors Don&#x27;t They: A Memoir&quot; with Jack Fainman. He died on May 31, 2018 in Winnipeg.

== Honours ==

In 2000, he was named to the Order of Canada. In 2014, he was made a member of the Order of Manitoba.

<text>Room for Squares is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter and guitarist John Mayer, originally released on June 5, 2001, and re-released on September 18, 2001, by both Aware and Columbia Records. Upon its release, it peaked at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received generally positive reviews from critics. It earned Mayer a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;.

&quot;Room for Squares&quot; is Mayer&#x27;s best-selling album to date, having sold over 4,484,000 copies in the United States as of July 2014.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s title is a reference to Hank Mobley&#x27;s &quot;No Room for Squares&quot; album. All songs from the album are written by Mayer; three songs, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot;, and &quot;Love Song for No One&quot;, were co-written with Clay Cook. The first two of these, along with &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Back to You&quot;, originally appeared on Mayer&#x27;s 1999 EP &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;. The songs are largely based on Mayer&#x27;s personal experiences.

Through constant shows, including in the Atlanta-area Eddie&#x27;s Attic, Mayer&#x27;s reputation began to build. In March, an acquaintance of Mayer&#x27;s, a lawyer, sent an EP to Gregg Latterman at Aware Records. After including him in the Aware Festival concerts and having his songs included on Aware compilations, in early 2001, Aware released &quot;Room for Squares&quot; as an internet-only album. During that time, Aware signed a deal with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first pick in signing Aware artists, and so in September 2001, Columbia remixed and re-released &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. As part of the major label &quot;debut&quot;, the album&#x27;s artwork was updated, and the track &quot;3x5&quot; was added, which did not appear on the original as the recording was not yet complete at the time. The re-release included reworked studio versions of the first four songs from his indie album, &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;. The cover art for the most recent release of &quot;Room for Squares&quot; features a periodic table design beginning from the back cover which continues to the front cover, ending at the right-side.

The album was relatively unknown at its time of release, but it became more well known through word of mouth and John&#x27;s touring, and reached number one Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers chart by March 2002. By the end of that year, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; had spawned several radio hits, including &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;, and ultimately, &quot;Why Georgia&quot; (a radio-only single).

==Reception==
By April 2002, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; had seen increases in eight of the previous nine weeks, earning the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s Greatest Gainer (from number 82 to 56)—a 36 percent surge. The increase was attributed to combination of a March performance of &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot; and the radio-and-retail campaign launched in more than 10 markets where Mayer was receiving airplay. It reached number seven on Billboard&#x27;s Top Pop Catalog. A steady seller, the album was certified platinum despite never being a top-ten hit.

Anthony DeCurtis for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, calling it &quot;irresistible&quot;. PopMatters gave an unfavorable review, saying &quot;It doesn&#x27;t offend, nor does it attempt to make itself too exciting for the most part.&quot; Robert Christgau said that composition lyrics like &quot;She keeps a toothbrush at my place/As if I had the extra space&quot; on &quot;City Love&quot; are an improvement over Norah Jones.

By the end of 2002, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; had spawned several radio hits, including, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;, and, ultimately, &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, which was released as a CD single six weeks before the follow-up album, &quot;Heavier Things&quot;, was released in 2003.

In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;. In his acceptance speech he remarked, “This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up.” He referred to himself as being sixteen, a remark that many mistook to mean that he was only sixteen years old at the time.

==Track listings==

Note: On the Columbia re-release, &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; is consistently listed as track 14; track 13 is an unlisted song with a duration of 0:04, and sometimes even 0:00. And the Columbia rereleased the drum has been removed but on the aware records version the drum is present through the whole entire song.

==Alternative covers==
The album&#x27;s cover for its initially planned June 2001 release in the United States and its Japan release had alternative covers.

Additionally the main album cover had a single dividing line changed between releases.

<doc id="1118308" wikidata="Q7997339" url="?curid=1118308" title="Who Made Yellow Roses Yellow?">
<text>Who Made Yellow Roses Red? is a work of short fiction by the novelist John Updike, first appearing in The New Yorker on March 30, 1956. It was published in his 1959 collection &quot;The Same Door&quot;.

==Plot==

As the story begins, Fred Platt, the focal character, is about to place a telephone call to a college friend he hasn&#x27;t seen in years. Platt, as the opening sentence indicates, comes from &quot;old money&quot;—is three generations removed from its accumulation. He wants to acquire a job without the contaminating hand of his father&#x27;s connections: 
Accordingly, he calls his old friend Clayton Thomas Clayton, a man of merely petty-bourgeois heritage, who has achieved genuine prosperity: He has risen to executive status in the advertising wing of an immense chemical company. Platt feels that Clayton owes him a favor because while at university he had facilitated his membership in an elite campus journal, the &quot;Quaff&quot;. The staff had disparaged the socially inept Clayton, but were compelled to acknowledge his talent as a cartoonist. The drama in the story consists of Fred’s horror at Clayton&#x27;s gauche, new-money ways, a horror that he with some effort suppresses in the interest of asking Clayton for a position with the firm: Platt’s sense of entitlement sharpens his expectations of success.

Though recognizing his former school-mate’s cosmopolitan sophistication, Clayton’s business acumen and hard-headed self-interest insulate him from Fred’s overtures. Platt departs empty-handed, but leaves Clayton with a parting-shot in school-book French to demonstrate his social superiority.

==Background==

Biographer Adam Begley reports the autobiographical antecedents to “Who Made Yellow Roses Yellow?”: Clayton Thomas Clayton is modeled closely on Updike himself. At the Harvard Lampoon, Updike as a freshman gained &quot;entre&quot; to the journal based on the quality of his cartoon submissions, and like Clayton, became the president of the journal in his senior year.

Updike was introduced to the work of J. D. Salinger through a literature professor, who read aloud Salinger&#x27;s stories published in The New Yorker. According to Adam Begley, Updike’s “Who Made the Roses Yellow” was influenced by &quot;Just Before the War with the Eskimos&quot; (1948).

==Style==

Literary critic Richard H. Rupp offers this passage from “Who Made Yellow Roses Yellow?” to illustrate Updike’s concern with “minute physical detail” as a means of revealing his subject’s character, a hallmark of his early style. Updike here is describing the character Fred Platt:

Rupp notes that this “microscopic” cataloging of personal features and behavior functions to “establish the writer’s authority: the story itself is secondary…We remember the voice far longer than the story.” Rupp reminds us that the name “Platt” is German for “flat” or “low.” Critic Robert Detwieler comments on Platt as a social type:

<doc id="1118310" wikidata="Q215659" url="?curid=1118310" title="Styria (Slovenia)">
<text>Styria (), also known as Slovenian Styria (; ) or Lower Styria (; ) to differentiate it from Austrian Styria, is a traditional region in northeastern Slovenia, comprising the southern third of the former Duchy of Styria. The population of Styria in its historical boundaries amounts to around 705,000 inhabitants, or 34.5% of the population of Slovenia. The largest city is Maribor.

==Use of the term==

In the 19th century, the Styrian duchy, which existed as a distinct political-administrative entity from 1056 to 1918, used to be divided into three traditional regions: Upper Styria (&quot;Obersteiermark&quot;; &quot;Zgornja Štajerska&quot;), Central Styria (&quot;Mittelsteiermark&quot;; &quot;Srednja Štajerska&quot;), and Lower Styria, stretching from the Mur River and the Slovene Hills in the north down to the Sava. Upper Styria and Central Styria, predominantly German-speaking, today form the Austrian state of Styria (&quot;Steiermark&quot;). The southern third, predominantly Slovene-speaking Lower Styria, became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) after World War I. After World War II, it became part of the predecessor of modern Slovenia, the Socialist Republic of Slovenia.

Although used interchangeably at times, the term &quot;Southern Styria&quot; (&quot;Südsteiermark&quot;) refers to the southern districts of the Austrian state of Styria, whereas the term &quot;Lower Styria&quot; (&quot;Spodnja Štajerska&quot;) refers to the region of Styria in northeastern Slovenia.

The Slovene name &quot;Štajerska&quot; is borrowed and adapted from the German name for the region, &quot;Steiermark&quot;. Both ultimately derive from Celtic, via the river Steyr.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the Lower Styrian lands were ruled by several immediate (&quot;reichsfrei&quot;) dynasties like the Counts of Celje, whose large possessions were not incorporated by the Habsburg dukes until the 15th century. 

According to the last Austro-Hungarian census of 1910, Lower Styria had around 498,000 inhabitants, of which around 82% were Slovene and around 18% German speakers.

In 1918, after the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy following World War I, the Duchy of Styria was divided between the newly established states of German Austria and the Yugoslav State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In early November 1918, Rudolf Maister, a Slovene major of the former Austro-Hungarian Army, with about 4,000 local volunteers occupied Lower Styria and the town of Maribor and claimed it for Yugoslavia. After a short fight with German-Austrian paramilitary units, the current border was established, acknowledged by the provisional Styrian assembly at Graz. By December 1918, all of Lower Styria was &quot;de facto&quot; included in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. A protest by German-speaking Marburg citizens resulted in the Marburg Bloody Sunday, when 13 people were killed and about 60 wounded.

Confirmed by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the border between Yugoslav and Austrian Styria mostly followed the ethnic-linguistic dividing line between Slovenes and ethnic Germans. Nevertheless, several predominantly German-speaking towns were annexed into Yugoslavia, such as Maribor () (80% German speakers), Ptuj () (86%), and Celje () (67%); in addition, the German-speaking area around the village of Apače () was annexed to Yugoslavia. According to the 1921 Yugoslav census, some 22,500 ethnic Germans lived in Yugoslav Lower Styria. They represented around 4.5% of the overall population of the region, and around 57% of all ethnic Germans in Slovenia. In 1931, this number dropped to around 12,500 or 2.3% of the regional population, and around 45% of all ethnic Germans in Slovenia.

In 1922, the County of Maribor was formed, comprising most of the territory of Slovene Styria, plus the Prekmurje and the Međimurje regions. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in January 1929, the counties were abolished and replaced with nine Banates (). Following the reorganization implemented by the Yugoslav constitution of 1931, Slovene Styria was incorporated in the newly established Drava Banovina, which was more or less identical with Slovenia, with Ljubljana as its capital city.

In April 1941, Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Slovene Styria was annexed, becoming under . A policy of violent Germanization was introduced. Public use of Slovene was prohibited, and all Slovene associations were dissolved. Members of all professional and intellectual groups, including many clergymen, were expelled. Between April 1941 and May 1942, around 80,000 Slovenes (almost 15% of the overall population) were expelled from Lower Styria, or resettled to other parts of the Reich. As a reaction, a resistance movement developed. Many areas of Lower Styria witnessed fierce fighting between German troops and Slovene partisan units.

After World War II, Yugoslav authority over the region was established and Slovene Styria became an integral part of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. According to prior decisions made by the Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Yugoslavia, an expulsion of the remaining ethnic German population was carried out, regardless of their links to the Nazi regime.

Between the 1950s and 1970s, many areas of the region underwent rapid industrialization. Towns like Maribor, Celje, and Velenje became among the most important industrial centers of Slovenia and Yugoslavia.

==Statistical division==
Lower Styria has no official status as an administrative or statistical unit within Slovenia. In 2005, the country was divided into 12 statistical regions. The bulk of Lower Styria is subdivided between the Drava Statistical Region () with its seat in Maribor, and the Savinja Statistical Region () with its seat in Celje. Smaller areas of Lower Styria are included in:
*The Mura Statistical Region (): the subregion called Prlekija, with the municipalities of Apače, Gornja Radgona, Križevci, Ljutomer, Radenci, Razkrižje, Sveti Jurij ob Ščavnici, and Veržej;
*The Carinthia Statistical Region (): the municipalities of Mislinja, Muta, Podvelka, Radlje ob Dravi, Ribnica na Pohorju, Slovenj Gradec, and Vuzenica;
*The Lower Sava Statistical Region (): the Municipality of Bistrica ob Sotli, and the territory on the left bank of the Sava River in the municipalities of Brežice, Krško, Sevnica, and Radeče;
*The Central Sava Statistical Region (): the territory on the left bank of the Sava River in the municipalities of Hrastnik and Trbovlje.

Nowadays, many of these peripheral areas are no longer considered part of Styria. An exception is the Prlekija subregion, which is still widely considered part of the region. The name &quot;Štajerska&quot; disappeared from official use in 1922, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was administratively divided into oblasts. Nevertheless, the name is still very much alive in both colloquial and media language, and it is part of established cultural and geographical terminology. It also continues to be employed in the promotion of tourism.

==Cities and towns==
The cultural and economic centre of Lower Styria has always been the city of Maribor. Other major towns are Brežice, Celje, Ptuj, Slovenj Gradec, Slovenska Bistrica, and Velenje.

==Tourism==
Styria is known for its white wine, especially Ljutomer Riesling, for the Pohorje ski resort, for cultural festivals and for pumpkin seed oil. It is also known as a hop-growing area producing Styrian Goldings, a variety of the English aroma hop Fuggles.

<text>A motor–generator (an MG set) is a device for converting electrical power to another form. Motor–generator sets are used to convert frequency, voltage, or phase of power. They may also be used to isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor–generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor–generators (such as the one shown in the picture) were used to convert battery power to higher DC voltages.

While a motor–generator set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo–motor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one end of the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts.

Low-powered consumer devices built before 1933, such as vacuum tube vehicle radio receivers, did not use expensive, noisy and bulky motor–generators. Instead, they used an inverter circuit consisting of a vibrator (a self-exciting relay) and a transformer to produce the higher voltages required for the vacuum tubes from the vehicle&#x27;s 6 or 12 V battery.

==Electrical power handling==
In the context of electric power generation and large fixed electrical power systems, a motor–generator consists of an electric motor mechanically coupled to an electric generator (or alternator). The motor runs on the electrical input current while the generator creates the electrical output current, with power flowing between the two machines as a mechanical torque; this provides electrical isolation and some buffering of the power between the two electrical systems.

One use is to eliminate spikes and variations in &quot;dirty power&quot; (power conditioning) or to provide phase matching between different electrical systems.

===Flywheel-generator===
Another use is to buffer extreme loads on the power system. For example, tokamak fusion devices impose very large peak loads, but relatively low average loads, on the electrical grid. The DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics, the Princeton Large Torus (PLT) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and the Nimrod synchrotron at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory each used large flywheels on multiple motor–generator rigs to level the load imposed on the electrical system: the motor side slowly accelerated a large flywheel to store energy, which was consumed rapidly during a fusion experiment as the generator side acted as a brake on the flywheel. Similarly, the next generation U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will use a flywheel motor–generator rig to supply power instantaneously for aircraft launches at greater than the ship&#x27;s installed generator capacity. In addition to the above specialized applications, flywheel-generator systems have been commercialized for use in data centers as an adjunct or alternative to more conventional battery or generator-based uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).

==Conversions==

Motor–generators may be used for various conversions including:
* Alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC)
* DC to AC
* DC at one voltage to DC at another voltage. (Also called a dynamotor, short for dynamo-motor)
* Creating or balancing a three-wire DC system.
* AC at one frequency to AC at another harmonically-related frequency
* AC at a fixed voltage to AC of a variable voltage
* AC single-phase to AC three-phase

==Variable AC voltage power supply==
Before solid state AC voltage regulation was available or cost effective, motor generator sets were used to provide a variable AC voltage. The DC voltage to the generator&#x27;s armature would be varied manually or electronically to control the output voltage. When used in this fashion, the MG set is equivalent to an isolated variable transformer.

==High-frequency machines==
An Alexanderson alternator is a motor-driven, high-frequency alternator which provides radio frequency power. In the early days of radio communication, the high frequency carrier wave had to be produced mechanically using an alternator with many poles driven at high speeds. Alexanderson alternators produced RF up to 600 kHz, with large units capable of 500 kW power output. While electromechanical converters were regularly used for long wave transmissions in the first three decades of the 20th century, electronic techniques were required at higher frequencies. The Alexanderson alternator was largely replaced by the vacuum tube oscillator in the 1920s.

==Motor–generators used to increase &quot;ride-through&quot;==

Motor–generators have even been used where the input and output currents are essentially the same. In this case, the mechanical inertia of the MG set is used to filter out transients in the input power. The output&#x27;s electric current can be very clean (noise free) and will be able to ride-through brief blackouts and switching transients at the input to the MG set. This may enable, for example, the flawless cut-over from mains power to AC power provided by a diesel generator set.

The motor–generator set may contain a large flywheel to improve its ride-through; however, consideration must be taken in this application as the motor–generator will lose speed and may draw a large current when power returns or the circuit-breaker is re-closed. If the speed loss is excessive (the power outage is too long), the re-closure current will trip the protection circuit-breakers, resulting in a shut down. The in-rush current during re-closure will depend on many factors, however. As an example, a 250 kVA motor–generator operating at 300 ampere of full load current will require 1550 ampere of in-rush current during a re-closure after 5 seconds. This example used a fixed mounted flywheel sized to result in a  Hz per second slew rate. The motor–generator was a vertical type two-bearing machine with oil-bath bearings.

Motors and generators may be coupled by a non-conductive shaft in facilities that need to closely control electromagnetic radiation, or where high isolation from transient surge voltages is required.

==Modern use of motor–generators==
Motor–generator sets have been replaced by semiconductor devices for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets was in elevators. Since accurate speed control of the hoisting machine was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drive electronics with compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since electronic AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than MG DC-powered machinery.

Another use for MG sets was in the southern region of British Rail. They were used to convert the 600 V DC – 850 V DC line supply voltage from the third rail into 70 V DC to power the controls of the EMU stock in use. These have since been replaced with solid state converters on new rolling stock. MG locomotives have also commonly been used for long distance rail Diesel locomotive transmission throughout the world, due to reliability and wear issues with mechanical and fluid transmissions, but this is generally being replaced with smaller engines with conventional or MG transmission on each carriage. Long distance electric locomotives with high voltage overhead power supply used MG transmission, but this is generally being replaced with distributed motor drive on each carriage with electronic power control and conversion.

Similarly, MG sets were used in the PCC streetcar to produce a 36VDC output from the 600VDC traction supply. The low voltage output charges the streetcar&#x27;s batteries and supplies current for control and auxiliary equipment (including headlights, gong ringers, door motors and electromagnetic track brakes).

Motor–generator sets were often used to provide the high-current D.C. power for carbon arc lamps in large movie projectors in the 1950-60&#x27;s era, before the carbon electrode arc light was replaced with modern xenon arc lamp projection systems (starting in 1963 in the U.S.).

In industrial settings where harmonic cancellation, frequency conversion, or line isolation is needed, MG sets remain a popular solution. A useful feature of motor–generators is that they can handle large short-term overloads better than semiconductor devices of the same average load rating. Consider that the thermally current-limited components of a large semiconductor inverter are solid-state switches massing a few grams with a thermal time constant to their heat sinks of likely more than 100 ms, whereas the thermally current limited components of an MG are copper windings massing sometimes hundreds of kilograms which are intrinsically attached to their own large thermal mass. They also have inherently excellent resistance to electrostatic discharge (ESD).

==Motor/generator versus motor–generator==
In principle, any electrical generator can also serve as an electric motor, or vice versa. In hybrid vehicles and other lightweight power systems, a &quot;motor/generator&quot; is a single electric machine that can be used as an electric motor or a generator, converting between electrical power and mechanical power.

From the 2014 season, Formula 1 racing cars will have two of what are described as &#x27;Motor Generator Units&#x27; (MGUs), one each on the drive train and the turbocharger. These are motor/generators rather than motor–generators, single units which can act as &quot;either&quot; a motor or a generator. They make the cars more fuel-efficient by harvesting energy from regenerative braking and from the turbocharger, and can also be used to provide up to 160 BHP extra to the wheels to aid acceleration and overtaking, or to spin up the turbo to increase boost pressure faster, thereby reducing turbo lag.

<text>Anammox, an abbreviation for &quot;anaerobic ammonium oxidation&quot;, is a globally important microbial process of the nitrogen cycle that takes place in many natural environments. The bacteria mediating this process were identified in 1999, and were a great surprise for the scientific community. In the anammox reaction, nitrite and ammonium ions are converted directly into diatomic nitrogen and water.

The bacteria that perform the anammox process are genera that belong to the bacterial phylum Planctomycetota. The anammox bacteria all possess one anammoxosome, a lipid bilayer membrane-bound compartment inside the cytoplasm in which the anammox process takes place. The anammoxosome membranes are rich in ladderane lipids; the presence of these lipids is so far unique in biology.

&quot;Anammox&quot; is also the trademarked name for an anammox-based ammonium removal technology developed by the Delft University of Technology.

==Process background==
In this biological process, which is a redox comproportionation reaction, nitrite and ammonium ions are converted directly into a diatomic molecule of nitrogen and water.

: (Δ&quot;G&quot;° = ).

Globally, this process may be responsible for 30–50% of the gas produced in the oceans. It is thus a major sink for fixed nitrogen and so limits oceanic primary productivity.

The bacteria that perform the anammox process belong to the bacterial phylum Planctomycetota. Currently, five anammox genera have been discovered: &quot;Brocadia&quot;, &quot;Kuenenia&quot;, &quot;Anammoxoglobus&quot;, &quot;Jettenia&quot; (all fresh water species), and &quot;Scalindua&quot; (marine species). The anammox bacteria are characterized by several striking properties: 

* They all possess one anammoxosome, a membrane bound compartment inside the cytoplasm which is the locus of anammox catabolism. Further, the membranes of these bacteria mainly consist of ladderane lipids so far unique in biology. 
* Of special interest is the conversion to hydrazine (normally used as a high-energy rocket fuel, and poisonous to most living organisms) as an intermediate. 
* A final striking feature of the organism is the extremely slow growth rate; the doubling time is anywhere from 7–22 days. 

The anammox bacteria are geared towards converting their substrates at very low concentrations; in other words, they have a very high affinity to their substrates ammonium and nitrite (sub-micromolar range). Anammox cells are packed with cytochrome c type proteins (≈30% of the protein complement), including the enzymes that perform the key catabolic reactions of the anammox process, making the cells remarkably red. The anammox process was originally found to occur only from 20 °C to 43 °C but more recently, anammox has been observed at temperatures from 36 °C to 52 °C in hot springs and 60 °C to 85 °C at hydrothermal vents located along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

==History==
In 1932, it was reported that dinitrogen gas was generated via an unknown mechanism during fermentation in the sediments of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA. In 1965, F. A. Richards noticed that most of the ammonium that should be produced during the anaerobic remineralization of organic matter was unaccounted for. As there was no known biological pathway for this transformation, biological anaerobic oxidation of ammonium received little further attention. 

In 1977, Engelbert Broda predicted the existence of two chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms capable of oxidizing ammonium to dinitrogen gas on the basis of thermodynamic calculations. It was thought that anaerobic oxidation of ammonium would not be feasible, assuming that the predecessors had tried and failed to establish a biological basis for those reactions. By the 1990s, Arnold Mulder&#x27;s observations were just consistent with Richard&#x27;s suggestion. In their anoxic denitrifying pilot reactor, ammonium disappeared at the expense of nitrite with a clear nitrogen production. The reactor used the effluent from a methanogenic pilot reactor, which contained ammonium, sulphide and other compounds, and nitrate from a nitrifying plant as the influent. The process was named &quot;anammox,&quot; and was realized to have great significance in the removal of unwanted ammonium. 

The discovery of the anammox process was first publicly presented at the 5th European congress on biotechnology. By the mid-1990s, the discovery of anammox in the fluidized bed reactor was published. A maximum ammonium removal rate of 0.4 kg N/m3/d was achieved. It was shown that for every mole of ammonium consumed, 0.6 mol of nitrate was required, resulting in the formation of 0.8 mol of gas. 

In 1995, the biological nature of anammox was identified. Labeling experiments with in combination with showed that 14-15 was the dominant product making up 98.2% of the total labeled . It was realized that, instead of nitrate, nitrite was assumed as the oxidizing agent of ammonium in anammox reaction. Based on a previous study, Strous et al. calculated the stoichiometry of anammox process by mass balancing, which is widely accepted by other groups. Later, anammox bacteria were identified as Planctomycetota, and the first identified anammox organism was named &quot;Candidatus&quot; &quot;Brocadia anammoxidans.&quot; 

Before 2002, anammox was assumed to be a minor player in the nitrogen cycle within natural ecosystems. In 2002 however, anammox was found to play an important part in the biological nitrogen cycle, accounting for 24–67% of the total production in the continental shelf sediments that were studied. The discovery of anammox process modified the concept of biological nitrogen cycle, as depicted in Figure 2.

==Possible reaction mechanisms==


According to labeling experiments carried out in 1997, ammonium is biologically oxidized by hydroxylamine, most likely derived from nitrite, as the probable electron acceptor. The conversion of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas is hypothesized to be the reaction that generates the electron equivalents for the reduction of nitrite to hydroxylamine. In general, two possible reaction mechanisms are addressed: 

* One mechanism hypothesizes that a membrane-bound enzyme complex converts ammonium and hydroxylamine to hydrazine first, followed by the oxidation of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas in the periplasm. At the same time, nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine at the cytoplasmic site of the same enzyme complex responsible for hydrazine oxidation with an internal electron transport (Figure 3a). 
* The other mechanism postulates the following: ammonium and hydroxylamine are converted to hydrazine by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, hydrazine is oxidized in the periplasm to dinitrogen gas, and the generated electrons are transferred via an electron transport chain to nitrite reducing enzyme in the cytoplasm where nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine (Figure 3b). 

Whether the reduction of nitrite and the oxidation of hydrazine occur at different sites of the same enzyme or the reactions are catalyzed by different enzyme systems connected via an electron transport chain remains to be investigated. In microbial nitrogen metabolism, the occurrence of hydrazine as an intermediate is rare. Hydrazine has been proposed as an enzyme-bound intermediate in the nitrogenase reaction.
Recently, using detailed molecular analyses and combining complementary methods, Kartal and coworkers published strong evidence supporting the latter mechanism.
Furthermore, the enzyme producing hydrazine, hydrazine synthase was purified and shown to produce hydrazine from NO and ammonium. The production of hydrazine from ammonium and NO was also supported by the resolution of the crystal structure of the enzyme hydrazine synthase.

A possible role of nitric oxide (NO) or nitroxyl (HNO) in anammox was proposed by Hooper et al. by way of condensation of NO or HNO and ammonium on an enzyme related to the ammonium monooxygenase family. The formed hydrazine or imine could subsequently be converted by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidase to dinitrogen gas, and the reducing equivalents produced in the reaction are required to combine NO or HNO and ammonium or to reduce nitrite to NO. Environmental genomics analysis of the species &quot;Candidatus&quot; &quot;Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&quot;, through a slightly different and complementary metabolism mechanism, suggested NO to be the intermediate instead of hydroxylamine (Figure 4). However, this hypothesis also agreed that hydrazine was an important intermediate in the process. In this pathway (Figure 4), there are two enzymes unique to anammox bacteria: hydrazine synthase (hzs) and hydrazine dehydrogenase (hdh). The HZS produces hydrazine from nitric oxide and ammonium, and HDH transfer the electrons from hydrazine to ferredoxin. Few new genes, such as some known fatty acid biosynthesis and S-adenosylmethionine radical enzyme genes, containing domains involved in electron transfer and catalysis have been detected. Anammox microorganisms can also directly couple NO reduction to ammonia oxidation, without the need for nitrite supply.

Another, still unexplored, reaction mechanism involves anaerobic ammonium oxidation on anodes of bio-electrical systems. Such systems can be microbial fuel cells or microbial electrolysis cells. In the absence of dissolved oxygen, nitrite, or nitrate, microbes living in the anode compartment are able to oxidize ammonium to dinitrogen gas (N2) just as in the classical anammox process. At the same time, they unload the liberated electrons onto the anode, producing electrical current. This electrical current can be used either directly in fuel cell mode or for hydrogen and methane gas production in electrolysis mode. While there is no clarity on the reaction mechanism behind, one hypothesis is that nitrite, nitrate, or dinitrogen oxide play a role as intermediates. However, since the process occurs at very low electrochemical potentials, other, more speculative, reaction mechanisms seem possible as well.

==Species diversity==
Until now, ten anammox species have been described, including seven that are available in laboratory enrichment cultures. All have the taxonomical status of &quot;Candidatus&quot;, as none were obtained as classical pure cultures. Known species are divided over five genera: 

# &quot;Kuenenia&quot;, one species: &quot;Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&quot;. 
# &quot;Brocadia&quot;, three species: &quot;B. anammoxidans&quot;, &quot;B. fulgida&quot;, and &quot;B. sinica&quot;. 
# &quot;Anammoxoglobus&quot;, one species: &quot;A. propionicus&quot;. 
# &quot;Jettenia&quot;, one species: &quot;J. asiatica&quot;. 
# &quot;Scalindua&quot;, four species: &quot;S. brodae&quot;, &quot;S. sorokinii&quot;, &quot;S. wagneri&quot;, and &quot;S. profunda.&quot; 

Representatives of the first four genera were enriched from sludge from wastewater treatment plants; &quot;K. stuttgartiensis&quot;, &quot;B. anammoxidans&quot;, &quot;B. fulgida&quot;, and &quot;A. propionicus&quot; were even obtained from the same inoculum. &quot;Scalindua&quot; dominates the marine environment, but is also found in some freshwater ecosystems and wastewater treatment plants. 

Together, these 10 species likely only represent a minute fraction of anammox biodiversity. For instance, there are currently over 2000 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with anammox bacteria that have been deposited to the Genbank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), representing an overlooked continuum of species, subspecies, and strains, each apparently having found its specific niche in the wide variety of habitats where anammox bacteria are encountered. Species microdiversity is particularly impressive for the marine representative &quot;Scalindua&quot;. A question that remains to be investigated is which environmental factors determine species differentiation among anammox bacteria.

The sequence identities of the anammox 16S rRNA genes range from 87 to 99%, and phylogenetic analysis places them all within the phylum &quot;Planctomycetota&quot;, which form the PVC superphylum together with &quot;Verrucomicrobia&quot; and &quot;Chlamydiae&quot;. Within the &quot;Planctomycetota&quot;, anammox bacteria deeply branch as a monophyletic clade. Their phylogenetic position together with a broad range of specific physiological, cellular, and molecular traits give anammox bacteria their own order &quot;Brocadiales&quot;.

==Application in wastewater treatment==
The application of the anammox process lies in the removal of ammonium in the wastewater treatment and consists of two separate processes.
The first step is the partial nitrification (nitritation) of half of the ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria:

: 2 + 3 → 2 + 4 + 2 

The remaining half of the ammonium and the newly formed nitrite are converted in the anammox process to diatomic nitrogen gas and nitrate (not shown) by anammox bacteria:

: + → + 2 

Both processes can take place in 1 reactor where two guilds of bacteria form compact granules.

For the enrichment of the anammox organisms a granular biomass or biofilm system seems to be especially suited in which the necessary sludge age of more than 20 days can be ensured. Possible reactors are sequencing batch reactors (SBR), moving bed reactors or gas-lift-loop reactors. The cost reduction compared to conventional nitrogen removal is considerable; the technique is still young but proven in several fullscale installations.

The first full scale reactor intended for the application of anammox bacteria was built in the Netherlands in 2002. In other wastewater treatment plants, such as the one in Germany (Hattingen), anammox activity is coincidentally observed though were not built for that purpose. As of 2006, there are three full scale processes in The Netherlands: one in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (in Rotterdam), and two on industrial effluent. One is a tannery, the other a potato processing plant.

===Advantages===
Conventional nitrogen removal from ammonium-rich wastewater is accomplished in two separate steps: nitrification, which is mediated by aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrification carried out by denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate to with the input of suitable electron donors. Aeration and input of organic substrates (typically methanol) show that these two processes are: 
# Highly energy consuming.
# Associated with the production of excess sludge.
# Produce significant amounts of green-house gases such as and and ozone-depleting NO.

Because anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly to anaerobically, this process does not require aeration and other electron donors. Nevertheless, oxygen is still required for the production of nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. However, in partial nitritation/anammox systems, oxygen demand is greatly reduced because only half of the ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite instead of full conversion to nitrate. The autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guarantee a low yield and thus less sludge production. Additionally, anammox bacteria easily form stable self-aggregated biofilm (granules) allowing reliable operation of compact systems characterized by high biomass concentration and conversion rate up to 5–10 kg N m−3. Overall, it has been shown that efficient application of the anammox process in wastewater treatment results in a cost reduction of up to 60% as well as lower emissions.

===Disadvantages===
The doubling time is slow, between 10 days to 2 weeks. This makes it difficult to grow enough sludge for a wastewater treatment reactor. Also the recovery time after the loss of sludge by accident is longer than in conventional nitrogen removal systems. On the other hand, this slow growing rate is an advantage due to the reduction of surplus sludge that needs to be removed and treated. Depending on the exact species, the optimum pH level is 8. Therefore, it can be necessary to adjust the pH of the wastewater by adding caustic.

<text>Bridgman is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies in the northern hemisphere, to the northwest of the crater Kurchatov. To the west-southwest is the old formation Becquerel, and eastward are the craters Pawsey and Wiener.

The prominent outer wall of Bridgman is only somewhat worn, and retains much of its original detail including traces of terrace structures and slumping. The rim is not quite circular, having a slight polygonal appearance with rounded corners. There is a notable inward bulge of the wall at the south end. The interior floor is generally level, with a central peak formation at the midpoint.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Bridgman was called &quot;Crater 52&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bridgman.

<doc id="1118331" wikidata="Q4660337" url="?curid=1118331" title="A Trillion Feet of Gas">
<text>“A Trillion Feet of Gas” is a work of short fiction by John Updike first appearing in The New Yorker on December 8, 1956. The story was collected The Same Door (1959), published by Alfred A. Knopf. 

==Plot==

An American couple, Luke and Liz Forrest, want to introduce a visiting English friend to an authentic American billionaire. They take him to a dinner party where he meets a Texan businessman, John Born. The Forrests and their friend, Donald King, and Mr. Born discuss the recent re-election of President Dwight David Eisenhower and a gas bill that the President vetoed earlier in the year.

The history that provoked Updike to write a story about such a conversation has been largely forgotten in the intervening half century, but at that time he was able to assume most of his readers would know that on February 6, 1956, Senator Francis Case of South Dakota had said on the U.S. Senate floor that a lobbyist for a natural gas company had left $2500 in cash in an envelope waiting for him, presumably in exchange for his vote on the deregulatory bill. This set off an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and forced creation of a select Senate committee to look into lobbying practices.
The deregulation bill passed anyway, although President Eisenhower vetoed it on February 17.

In the fictional discussion of these events, as Updike portrays it, Mr. Born claims that he is in possession of a trillion feet of natural gas that he has no incentive to sell unless some similar bill is passed in the next session of Congress and signed. On their way home, the Forrests and Mr. King are a bit confused. They wonder how many zeros are in a trillion — American and British conventions on that differed—and whether he meant a trillion feet (305 million km) spread out along a pipeline or a trillion cubic feet (28 km3).

==Background==

“A Trillion Feet of Gas” is one of eight short stories Updike wrote between 1955 and 1957, which were collected in The Same Door (1959) after appearing individually in The New Yorker. These stories are all set in Manhattan and most of them, including “A Trillion Feet of Gas” examine the struggles of young married couples who must reconcile their provincial sensibilities with the demands of a cosmopolitan urban life.

The couple in this tale, Luke and Liz Forrest “are modeled more or less exactly” on Updike and his wife Mary Pennington Updike.

Updike was under the influence of contemporary authors J. D. Salinger, whose work he discovered while attending Harvard University, and John Cheever whose works he had read in The New Yorker. Indeed, the title of “A Trillion Feet of Gas” is “Salingeresque” according to literary critic William H. Pritchard.

<text>Becquerel is a lunar impact crater that lies in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. This is an ancient and heavily worn formation that is now little more than an irregular buri in the surface. The outer rim has been worn and reshaped until it forms a rugged, mountainous region around the flatter interior.

The most notable of the formations on the rim is Becquerel X, which is part of a double crater along the northwestern rim. There is a short valley paralleling the southwestern rim, most likely formed by the merging of several small craters. The interior floor of Becquerel is relatively flat, but with rough sections and several tiny craterlets marking the surface. There is a dark patch (low albedo) on the floor near the southern rim.

To the west of Becquerel are H. G. Wells and Tesla, to the north is Segers, to the northeast is Bridgman, and to the south is Van Maanen.

The crater&#x27;s name was adopted by the IAU in 1970.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Becquerel.

<text>The first USS &quot;Batfish&quot; (SS/AGSS-310) is a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, known primarily for sinking three Imperial Japanese Navy submarines, &quot;Ro-55, Ro-112,&quot; and &quot;Ro-113&quot;, in a 76-hour period, in February 1945. USS &quot;Batfish&quot; is the first vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the batfish, a type of anglerfish that crawls about on the sea floor.

&quot;Batfish&quot; served during World War II. Her war operations spanned a period from 11 December 1943 to 26 August 1945, during which she completed seven war patrols. She is credited with having sunk nine Japanese ships totaling 10,658 tons while operating east of Japan and in the Philippine Sea, Luzon Strait, and South China Sea. &quot;Batfish&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for her sixth war patrol during which she sank three Japanese submarines in the South China Sea in four days.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally to be named &quot;Acoupa&quot;, hull SS-310 was renamed &quot;Batfish&quot; on 24 September 1942 prior to its keel laying on 27 December 1942 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 5 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Nellie W. Fortier, and commissioned on 21 August 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Wayne R. Merrill in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Following her commissioning, &quot;Batfish&quot; underwent an extensive shakedown and training period to instruct the crew in combat procedures for diving, attacking, evading, and damage control. She left the Portsmouth Navy Yard in mid-September 1943, paused briefly at Newport, Rhode Island, to practice on the torpedo range, and then continued on to New London, Connecticut. She arrived there on 26 September 1943 and, after voyage repairs, underwent additional training in submarine combat routine.

&quot;Batfish&quot; left New London on 15 October to join the war in the Pacific. While still northeast of the Panama Canal, &quot;Batfish&quot; sighted another submarine and, believing it to be a German U-boat, fired a torpedo at it. The torpedo missed, and the other submarine disappeared.

Just as &quot;Batfish&quot; approached the Panama Canal, a U.S. Navy patrol bomber mistook her for a U-boat and almost dropped its bombload on her. On 1 November 1943, &quot;Batfish&quot; tied up at Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone for an overnight stop, then transited the canal and spent a week in Balboa on the Pacific end of the canal for minor repairs and rest.

On 8 November 1943, &quot;Batfish&quot; resumed her journey, making an independent voyage during which her crew conducted daily drills. She arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 19 November 1943. After reporting for duty to the Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, &quot;Batfish&quot; spent five days alongside the submarine tender at Pearl Harbor for repairs. She then carried out intensive training in United States Pacific Fleet procedures.

====First war patrol====

&quot;Batfish&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 11 December 1943 and began her first war patrol, an open-sea patrol south of Honshu, Japan. She fought typhoons most of the way but finally reached her patrol area on 28 December 1943. However, bad weather continued to dog her operations and made it impossible for her to attack the few Japanese convoys she sighted. On 14 January 1944, her radar picked up a large contact. Signals intelligence identified it as the Imperial Japanese Navy battleship , one of the two largest warships in the world. Merrill chose to dive rather than use the cover of the heavy seas to close the battleship on the surface, and &quot;Batfish&quot;′s slower submerged speed caused her to fall rapidly out of range of &quot;Yamato&quot; and her escorts.

Shortly after 12:00 on 19 January 1944, a convoy of four Japanese ships appeared on the horizon and, with nightfall, &quot;Batfish&quot; made a high-speed surface run to close for an attack. She fired three torpedoes at each of two cargo ships, sinking one and crippling the other. The other two ships escaped, but &quot;Batfish&quot; remained on the scene to sink the crippled cargo ship, the 5,486-gross register ton &quot;Hidaka Maru&quot;, early the following morning. Postwar assessment of Japanese shipping losses only credited &quot;Batfish&quot; with this last sinking.

&quot;Batfish&quot; departed her patrol area on 24 January 1944 and headed back through typhoons to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where she arrived on 30 January 1944. At Midway, she underwent a two-week refit, followed by a week of training.

====Second war patrol====

&quot;Batfish&quot; departed Midway Atoll on 22 February 1944 bound for another patrol area south of Honshu. This patrol was unsuccessful because of continual high winds and heavy seas that seemed to have kept the Japanese in port. &quot;Batfish&quot; departed her patrol area on 3 April 1944 without making contact with any ship larger than a sampan. She proceeded to Pearl Harbor for refit, which began upon her arrival there on 15 April 1944. A relief crew from the submarine tender took over to allow &quot;Batfish&quot;′s crew two weeks of rest. The refit was extended, but finally, on 10 May 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Midway Atoll and additional training. While she was at Midway, Lieutenant Commander John K. &quot;Jake&quot; Fyfe relieved Merrill of command.

====Third war patrol====

On 26 May 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; departed Midway Atoll to patrol an area covering the southern coasts of Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu. The weather was excellent. On 10 June 1944, she attacked and thought she had sunk a Japanese cargo ship in use as a training ship, but the kill was not confirmed. Retaliatory depth-charge attacks by Japanese planes and patrol boats failed to damage &quot;Batfish&quot;, and she continued her patrol. On 18 June 1944 she sighted two Japanese ships, a coastal cargo ship and a small, but heavily laden, tanker. Although within sight of the coast of Honshu, &quot;Batfish&quot; closed in for the kill and claimed to have sunk the cargo ship.

On 22 June 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; sighted a large Japanese cargo ship steaming independently down the Japanese coast. She fired three of her bow torpedo tubes at the ship, but all three passed astern of her. As the first target rounded Andakino Point and headed away, a larger Japanese cargo ship, &quot;Nagaragawa Maru&quot;, passed her on an opposite course. &quot;Batfish&quot; fired four torpedoes from her stern tubes at &quot;Nagaragawa Maru&quot;, allowing her to make a quick escape out to sea. &quot;Nagaragawa Maru&quot; sank by the stern. However, a Japanese patrol boat immediately gave chase to &quot;Batfish&quot;, forcing her to dive to avoid depth charges. Unfortunately, &quot;Batfish&quot;′s nautical charts were not accurate: They showed depths of in the area, but &quot;Batfish&quot; grounded on an underwater volcanic peak at a depth of . &quot;Batfish&quot; rapidly eased backwards and upwards, but endured a tense eight hours punctuated by more than 50 depth charges before she could surface and survey her damage. The depth charges had caused none, but the grounding had jammed the starboard sound head, reducing her underwater listening capabilities, and had bent the starboard propeller shaft and propeller.

Nevertheless, &quot;Batfish&quot; continued her patrol. She sighted a Japanese convoy on 28 June 1944, but before she could reach a suitable attack position, the Japanese attacked her with torpedoes and aerial bombs, forcing her to let the convoy escape. However, she picked up another contact on 29 June 1944, a Japanese convoy with a cargo ship as a prime target. &quot;Batfish&quot; fired three torpedoes from her bow tubes that missed their mark when the Japanese maneuvered to avoid them. This convoy also made good its escape.

On 2 July 1944, as &quot;Batfish&quot; departed her patrol area bound for Midway Atoll, a lookout sighted two Japanese ships, a small trawler traveling with a converted yacht serving as an escort. &quot;Batfish&quot; closed in for a surface attack, and her guns filled the trawler with holes but failed to trigger an explosion. The escort moved at high speed to ram &quot;Batfish&quot;, which backed at emergency speed and narrowly avoided a collision. Full of holes from &quot;Batfish&quot;′s raking gunfire, the converted yacht was engulfed in flames and quickly sank. &quot;Batfish&quot; suffered one casualty, the pharmacist&#x27;s mate, who was hit by a bullet in the knee while at his post on deck in the surface gun action that ended in the destruction of what proved to be the guard boats &quot;Kamoi Maru&quot; and &quot;No. 5 Isuzugawa Maru&quot;.

&quot;Batfish&quot; returned to Midway Atoll, where she underwent a 16-day refit alongside &quot;Proteus&quot;. Her crew then trained in firing the new electric Mark 18 torpedo.

====Fourth war patrol====

&quot;Batfish&quot; departed Midway Atoll on 1 August 1944 for her fourth war patrol, which took her to waters surrounding the Palau Islands. Her assigned area offered up no worthy targets, but a report of a Japanese destroyer grounded to the north of the Palaus sent her to Velasco Reef to investigate. There, she found two Japanese ships – minelayer and a transport – aground on the reef and the Japanese destroyer on the beach across the atoll where it had run aground on 18 August 1944. A Japanese floatplane, two tugs, two patrol boats, and a minesweeper that &quot;Batfish&quot; identified as a second destroyer were in attendance. &quot;Batfish&quot; selected the transport as her first target, but poor visibility, rain, and rough seas intervened. On 23 August 1944, while making an approach to locate the transport again in a rain squall, &quot;Batfish&quot; found the minesweeper, which her crew still believed to be a destroyer, in her sights instead. She fired three torpedoes from her bow tubes that hit the warship and blew her apart at . Japanese records later identified the ship as . On 26 August 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; damaged &quot;Samidare&quot; beyond repair with two torpedo hits at and later witnessed the Japanese completing the destruction of &quot;Samidare&quot; with demolition charges.

Called away from Velasco Reef by orders to stand lifeguard duty off Peleliu between 27 and 29 August 1944 during air strikes on Peleliu and nearby Koror, &quot;Batfish&quot; did not return to Velasco Reef until two days before her departure from the patrol area. One Japanese ship still lay high and dry on the reef, but closer inspection revealed her to be already beyond salvage. &quot;Batfish&quot; chased a Japanese minelayer for 90 minutes, but it outmaneuvered her and escaped.

On 3 September 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; headed for refit at Fremantle, Australia. She arrived at Fremantle on 12 September 1944, and the submarine tender provided a relief crew to begin the refit, while &quot;Batfish&quot;′s own crew relaxed in Perth in Western Australia.

====Fifth war patrol====

Escorted by the Royal Australian Navy corvette , &quot;Batfish&quot; departed Fremantle on 8 October 1944 and proceeded with the submarine to Exmouth Gulf on the coast of Western Australia for refueling. On 11 October 1944, two hours after leaving Exmouth Gulf, a periscope jammed in the fully raised position and defied the crew&#x27;s efforts to correct the problem. &quot;Batfish&quot; proceeded to Darwin, Australia, for emergency repairs alongside the submarine rescue ship . Finally, on 17 October 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; headed out on her fifth war patrol, although chronic engineering problems plagued her throughout the patrol.

On 19 October 1944, &quot;Batfish&quot; picked up a radar contact – one large ship, which &quot;Batfish&quot; later identified as a tanker, with two escorts. When close enough, &quot;Batfish&quot; fired a salvo of six torpedoes, but all passed under the target. Surprisingly, the tanker and escorts took no evasive action, and &quot;Batfish&quot; closed for another attack. She fired a single torpedo set at a very shallow depth, but it too passed under the target, although it hit an escort on the other side. &quot;Batfish&quot; continued the pursuit because tankers had been deemed a high-priority target because of their vital role in supplying of petroleum to Japan. She closed for a surface attack, but at a range of , the target suddenly turned to attack. She was a &quot;Q ship,&quot; a heavily armed decoy for unwary Allied submarines, capable of speeds of . The Q-ship attacked at &quot;Batfish&quot; with guns and depth charges. &quot;Batfish&quot; dived and steadied up somewhere between her test depth and her crush depth to hide. After several hours, she began to withdraw from the area and slowly rose to the surface, where she found herself alone.

&quot;Batfish&quot;′s delays in Australia and the hide-and-seek game with the Q-ship caused her to miss the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte on 20 October 1944, which began both the Philippines campaign of 1944–1945 and the Battle of Leyte and triggered the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23–26 October 1944. She was assigned patrols in the Sulu Sea and the area between Mindanao and Negros Island and to the west of Luzon until 4 November 1944, when she received orders to perform lifeguard duties off Lingayen Gulf. On 6 November 1944, she sighted a Japanese 13-ship convoy including a choice target, a damaged heavy cruiser. As she approached and crept to periscope depth, she was nearly run over by a Japanese destroyer and only avoided collision by an emergency dive. Upon closing again, she fired six torpedoes from her bow tubes at a trailing transport, but all missed. &quot;Batfish&quot; was forced to dive and maneuver to evade depth charges from the convoy&#x27;s escorts. On 7 November 1944, she again caught up with the convoy when it anchored in San Fernando Harbor. As she closed the crippled heavy cruiser again, the escorts gave chase and depth-charged her until she retreated.

&quot;Batfish&quot; had no further opportunities to attack Japanese ships until 14 November 1944. Then, while operating in an attack group with the submarines and , she stalked a convoy of eight ships. After &quot;Ray&quot; and &quot;Raton&quot; had attacked, &quot;Batfish&quot; moved in and fired four torpedoes from her stern tubes that she thought sank a transport and an escort. However, these kills were not later confirmed. Soon thereafter, &quot;Batfish&quot; received orders to proceed to Pearl, and she arrived there on 1 December 1944.

====Sixth war patrol====
Following refit, &quot;Batfish&quot; got underway in company with the submarine on 30 December 1944 for her sixth war patrol, bound for the Mariana Islands as part of an attack group which also included the submarines and . The submarines arrived at Apra Harbor on Guam on 9 January 1945, but returned to sea on 10 January to take up patrol in the South China Sea to the northeast of Hainan Island. Early on 23 January 1945, the attack group made radar contact with a small fleet of junks. &quot;Batfish&quot; surfaced and fired at one of the larger junks, then dispatched boarding parties which searched four of the junks and found nothing but harmless Chinese fishermen aboard them. After giving the junks some supplies, &quot;Batfish&quot; resumed her patrol to the south to avoid further contact with the junks. Since Japanese convoys dwindled constantly both in size and number by this point in the war due to American advances and faltering Japanese defenses, &quot;Batfish&quot; encountered only small and isolated transports, and her attacks on them were cut short either by foul weather or by torpedoes that consistently passed under their targets.

On 2 February 1945, Batfish&#x27;s patrol area changed to Babuyan and the Calayan north of Luzon. After arriving on station, she sighted a small Japanese landing barge on a northerly course heading toward Formosa and made a surface attack. She was unable to sink the barge, but started a fire on board and thoroughly raked it with gunfire before leaving it behind.

On 3 February 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; was alerted to watch for Japanese vessels engaged in an evacuation to Formosa of Japanese personnel from the Aparri area of northern Luzon. On 4 February, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa, the commander of Japanese 6th Fleet, ordered the submarines , , , and to suspend their patrols, proceed to Takao on Formosa to offload torpedoes and ammunition, and then proceed to the Aparri area to embark evacuees.

After her engagement with the landing barge, &quot;Batfish&quot; made no contacts until 9 February 1945, when at 22:50 her SJ radar began tracking a blip moving at on a course of 310 degrees – i.e., away from Aparri and toward Formosa – at a range of . &quot;Batfish&quot; tentatively identified it as a Japanese submarine. Using radar and sound data to determine the target&#x27;s course and speed, &quot;Batfish&quot; closed with it and at 23:31 attacked with four torpedoes from her bow tubes, but all four torpedoes missed, and &quot;Batfish&quot; heard them detonate at the end of their runs. She prepared for another attack, and by 00:01 on 10 February a Japanese submarine was visible at a range of as Fyfe, alone on the bridge, guided &quot;Batfish&quot; in toward her target. At 00:02, &quot;Batfish&quot; fired four torpedoes from her bow tubes. The first malfunctioned and ran hot in the tube, the second hit the target with a brilliant red explosion, the third went through the explosion, and the fourth missed, detonating at the end of its run. &quot;Batfish&quot; subsequently heard distinct breaking-up noises and claimed the sinking of a Japanese submarine at , but the submarine&#x27;s identity has never been established. Some records identify her as , but &quot;I-41&quot; was not among the submarines ordered to take part in the evacuation and apparently was sunk on 18 November 1944 in the Philippine Sea by the destroyer escorts and and aircraft from the escort carrier . never acknowledged Miwa&#x27;s order and never arrived at Takao, and there is no evidence that she took part in the evacuation; the destroyer escort probably sank her southwest of Manila on 31 January 1945. &quot;Ro-46&quot; completed her evacuation mission successfully, and survived until at least April 1945. The Japanese submarine , not a participant in the evacuation but at Aparri at the time to offload ammunition, is almost certainly the submarine &quot;Batfish&quot; sank. although a submarine the destroyer escort sank on 7 February 1945 had been identified as &quot;Ro-55,&quot; evidence proves she was still afloat by 9 February 1945 when she departed for the safety of Formosa, but never reached destination due &quot;Batfish&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes.

During the patrol, Fyfe noted that &quot;Batfish&quot; sighted a significant number of Japanese aircraft, but that they passed her without attempting an attack, a behavior he attributed to what he presumed was the Japanese pilots being more concerned about the large number of American planes also in the area than with &quot;Batfish&quot;. On 10 February 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; detected approaching aircraft which she identified as a flight of four American fighters accompanying a U.S. Navy PBY Catalina flying boat. She submerged to periscope depth and established radio communications with the flight leader, but then gained sound contact on an approaching torpedo. She went to deep submergence and narrowly avoided the torpedo, which passed overhead. Fyfe assessed it as a probable friendly fire incident, in which the aircraft had mistaken her for a Japanese submarine, one of the fighters had spotted for the PBY by following &quot;Batfish&quot; down her track, and the PBY had dropped the torpedo.

At 19:51 on 11 February 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; gained radar contact on a target at a range of , and her radar detector picked up radar signals from it at the same time. At 20:37, when she had closed to a range of , her lookouts identified it as another Japanese submarine. The Japanese submarine then dived suddenly at 20:43. At 21:05, &quot;Batfish&quot;′s passive sonar detected the Japanese submarine blowing her ballast tanks, and at 21:06 the Japanese vessel surfaced again and resumed her course, apparently unaware of &quot;Batfish&quot;′s presence. &quot;Batfish&quot; again gained radar contact and detected the Japanese submarine&#x27;s radar at a range of . &quot;Batfish&quot; closed the range and submerged to radar depth at 21:50 at a range of . At 22:02, at a range of either or , according to different sources, she fired four Mark 18 electric torpedoes from her bow tubes. The first torpedo hit, blowing the Japanese submarine apart and sinking her almost immediately at . The victim later was identified as &quot;Ro-112&quot;.

At 02:13 or 02:15, according to different sources, on 13 February 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; gained SJ radar contact at a range of . on a target in the vicinity of Babuyan between Calayan and Daupin Island proceeding on a southeasterly course, on track from Formosa to Batulinao on Luzon. The contact disappeared from radar at 02:41 at a range of , indicating that it was a submerging submarine. It surfaced at 03:10, and &quot;Batfish&quot; regained radar and radar detector contact with it at a range of . &quot;Batfish&quot; submerged to radar depth at 04:12 with the Japanese submarine away, and at a range of fired three torpedoes from her stern tubes at 04:48. The first torpedo hit the submarine and blew her apart in large yellow fireball at , sinking her so quickly that the other two torpedoes missed. The submarine later was identified as &quot;RO-113&quot;.

The three Japanese submarines&#x27; use of radar, which, while helping them locate enemy targets, also made them vulnerable to attack because of &quot;Batfish&quot;′s capability to detect their radar emissions. There were no survivors from any of the three Japanese submarines.

&quot;Batfish&quot; had performed the unparalleled feat of sinking three enemy submarines in only four days. She headed for Guam on 16 February 1945 in company with &quot;Blackfish&quot;. As she pulled alongside the submarine tender in Apra Harbor on 21 February 1945, U.S. Navy photographers greeted the successful &quot;sub killer.&quot; She continued on to Hawaii in company with &quot;Archerfish&quot; and reached Pearl Harbor on 3 March 1945. She received a Presidential Unit Citation for the patrol.

====March–June 1945====
On 6 March 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor bound for San Francisco, California, which she reached on 13 March 1945. She entered the shipyard at the Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding Company there, which began modifying &quot;Batfish&quot; to participate in Operation Barney, a projected foray into the Japanese minefields guarding the southern entrance to the Sea of Japan by a nine-submarine unit equipped with new mine detectors. However, &quot;Batfish&quot;′s overhaul uncovered mechanical problems that delayed her preparations. These difficulties, along with her age, rendered &quot;Batfish&quot; too noisy for such a delicate operation.

&quot;Batfish&quot; finally departed the shipyard on 31 May 1945 and reached Pearl Harbor on 8 June. She trained for two weeks before departing for Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 26 June 1945.

====Seventh war patrol====
After calling at Saipan, &quot;Batfish&quot; got underway for her seventh war patrol, bound for a lifeguard station off the southeast coast of Kyushu. In the process of lifeguarding and avoiding mistaken attacks by Allied submarines and aircraft, &quot;Batfish&quot; became the target of two torpedoes, both of which crossed narrowly ahead. On 24 July, while creating a diversion for the submarines and , which were scheduled to pass through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan, &quot;Batfish&quot; battled on the surface and bombarded the village of Nagata. On 25 July, she sighted a Japanese submarine and attempted to close her for attack. However, the Japanese submarine moved safely through a mined channel and into Kagoshima Bay before &quot;Batfish&quot; could reach torpedo range.

On 26 July 1945, &quot;Batfish&quot; rescued three survivors from a ditched United States Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bomber. On 1 August 1945, an Okinawa-based B-25 mistook &quot;Batfish&quot; for a Japanese submarine and dropped four or five bombs, according to different sources, in her vicinity, but none landed close enough to damage her. The rescued aviators disembarked at Iwo Jima on 4 August 1945, and &quot;Batfish&quot; returned to lifeguard duty off Honshu. On 15 August 1945, word of Japan&#x27;s surrender arrived, and &quot;Batfish&quot; received orders to cease offensive operations.

===Post-World War II===
====1946–1952====
The submarine relieved &quot;Batfish&quot; on station, and &quot;Batfish&quot; proceeded via Midway Atoll to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 26 August 1945. On 2 September 1945, she departed Pearl Harbor and headed for San Francisco. Arriving there on 9 September 1945, she proceeded to the Mare Island Navy Yard at Mare Island, California, to prepare for decommissioning. Following completion of her pre-inactivation overhaul, she was decommissioned on 6 April 1946 and laid up as a training vessel in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, berthed at Mare Island.

====1952–1969====
&quot;Batfish&quot; received her reactivation overhaul in January 1952 and was recommissioned on 7 March 1952 with Lieutenant Commander Robert J. Jackson in command. After six weeks of training, she set course via the Panama Canal for Key West, Florida. She was assigned to Submarine Division 122 in the United States Atlantic Fleet on 21 April 1952. She served the remainder of her commissioned career in training operations in the Caribbean and along the East Coast of the United States.

&quot;Batfish&quot; was deactivated for the last time on 5 May 1957 at the Charleston Naval Shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina. She was decommissioned on 4 August 1958 and assigned to the Charleston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. During the summer of 1959, she was assigned as a United States Naval Reserve training vessel at New Orleans, Louisiana, and on 1 July 1960, she was redesignated as an &quot;auxiliary research submarine&quot; (AGSS-310). She continued to serve at New Orleans until she was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 November 1969.

* Presidential Unit Citation for her sixth war patrol.
*Nine battle stars for her World War II service.

===Procurement===
Impressed by the museum in Mobile, Alabama, which drew over 300,000 paying visitors its first year, the Oklahoma chapter of the United States Submarine Veterans of World War II sent a delegation from its Oklahoma City and Tulsa chapters in 1969 to ask the U.S. Navy if they could adopt a retired submarine. On hand at the time at Naval Support Activity New Orleans was , which the Navy agreed to turn over to them if they could fulfill the donation requirements. Wanting &quot;Piranha&quot; for his hometown, then-Oklahoma State Senator James Inhofe agreed to sponsor a bill accepting the submarine for Oklahoma.

An initial report claimed that it was impossible to get a submarine as far up the Arkansas River as Tulsa because the river channel was not deep enough above Muskogee, Oklahoma. Later, a direct tow from New Orleans to Muskogee also was deemed impossible, meaning that another method of transport would have to be devised. The Muskogee City-County Trust Port Authority in the meantime donated of prime waterfront real estate for the submarine&#x27;s berth and a memorial park.

The procurement committee of the Oklahoma Submarine Veterans chapter met with the Navy to make preliminary arrangements for the transfer of &quot;Piranha&quot;, but the Navy refused to hold the submarine unless the committee made a formal application for her with transfer from the Navy being immediate once the donation contract was approved. Since the Arkansas River Navigable Waterway system would not be open for at least a year, the procurement committee would have to incur interim docking charges in the meantime. To avoid this expense, the committee decided to wait and take its chances on another submarine being made available after the waterway opened.

In September 1970, the procurement committee inspected &quot;Batfish&quot; as a possible alternative to &quot;Piranha&quot;, both of which by then were in reserve at the Naval Inactive Ship Facility in Orange, Texas. Both submarines had suffered considerable neglect and &quot;Piranha&quot; had been almost completely cannibalized for parts, but &quot;Batfish&quot; was much cleaner and better outfitted. &quot;Batfish&quot;″s better war record compared to &quot;Piranha&quot;′s impressed the committee. In 1971, the committee made a formal application to the Navy to acquire &quot;Batfish&quot;. The Navy made no objection to the last-minute swap, and the donation contract was drawn up on 24 June 1971. John H. Chafee, the United States Secretary of the Navy, approved the transaction and the United States Congress approved the transfer on 8 November 1971.

===Towing and permanent placement===

On 9 December 1971, the Navy transferred ownership of &quot;Batfish&quot; to the Oklahoma Maritime Advisory Board. The towing was divided into two phases. the first phase was a direct offshore tow from Orange to Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. At the shipyard, &quot;Batfish&quot; was raised on steel lifting straps and cradled between two pairs of bare-decked barges so that the submarine&#x27;s draft was shallow enough to make the second phase of the tow, upriver, possible. Because of Strike action at the Orange drydock, &quot;Batfish&quot; instead was towed to the Bethlehem Beaumont Shipyard drydock in Beaumont, Texas.

After a general inspection and clearing of fuel and ballast tanks, &quot;Batfish&quot; was sealed up and was ready to tow to the Avondale Shipyard on 1 March 1972. At Avondale, it was found that the four barges were insufficient to reduce the submarine&#x27;s draft, and a new plan was devised to use six barges, ballasted to the outside and linked together by steel cables. On 13 March, &quot;Batfish&quot; was partially secured to the barges by lifting straps, but no cables had been placed to bind them together when the British tanker &quot;Silverman&quot; passed through a nearby zone at that afternoon: the resulting wake sank one barge and seriously damaged several others, although &quot;Batfish&quot; herself escaped major harm.

The flotilla of barges was re-assembled, and by two tugs slowly moved &quot;Batfish&quot; upriver at . On 3 May 1972 she passed with ease through Lock-and-Dam Number 6, but her superstructure had trouble clearing a bridge on the way into Little Rock, Arkansas, and was only able to pass under when the United States Army Corps of Engineers lowered the river level by . One tug returned downriver, and the second tug continued the tow towards Fort Smith, Arkansas. &quot;Batfish&quot; arrived at the Will Brothers Port of Muskogee Terminal on 7 May 1972: this was her temporary home until a wide, long trench could be dug to &quot;Batfish&quot;′s permanent berthing site. On 4 July 1972, while still at Muskogee Terminal, &quot;Batfish&quot; unofficially was opened to the public. Heavy spring rains flooded the Arkansas River on 12 March 1973, which caused &quot;Batfish&quot; to strain at her moorings, with fears that she would rip loose and damage the surrounding docks or collide with the new U.S. Route 62 bridge downriver and block the channel. Although &quot;Batfish&quot; remained moored, the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Commission balked at the risk the flood had revealed and asked to return &quot;Batfish&quot; to the Navy. However, the Navy declined, saying that it expected Oklahoma to honor its contract.

On 4 April 1973, the trench to the new slipway was completed, and &quot;Batfish&quot; was maneuvered into position by cables attached to four bulldozers and a Port of Muskogee tugboat. Over the next week, further flooding of the slip brought &quot;Batfish&quot; to her final resting elevation, and by 1 May 1973 she had been realigned to overlook the Arkansas River. at what is now Muskogee War Memorial Park: Home of the USS Batfish. &quot;Batfish&quot; officially was opened on the Memorial Day weekend in late May 1973. By the end of August 1973, she was attracting a thousand visitors a week, with income from paid attendance doubling over her first seven weeks on display. She had been restored well with the exception of her conning tower. Until May 2019, she was open to the public year-round.

===Flood damage and planned relocation===
&quot;Batfish&quot; sustained US$150,000 in damage during the May 2019 Arkansas River floods, when water from the Arkansas River filled the basin surrounding her, resulting in &quot;Batfish&quot; floating for the first time in decades. While &quot;Batfish&quot;&#x27;s hull remained watertight, allowing her to stay afloat as the water level rose, she began to list, which was corrected by the local fire department filling her ballast tanks with water. While the park and grounds remain open for visitors, &quot;Batfish&quot; remains closed to the public due to flood damage while funds are raised for repairs.

In November 2021, a plan was announced to relocate &quot;Batfish&quot; to Three Forks Harbor in Muskogee along with artifacts in the museum and pieces on the museum grounds. The time frame for the relocation operation was announced as three to five years.

<text>Birkhoff is a giant lunar walled plain that is located on the far side of the Moon, in the northern hemisphere. This formation is an ancient impact site that has been heavily eroded, and the surface reshaped by multiple craters in the interior and along the rim. The outer wall is bordered by the craters Carnot to the south, Rowland along the west rim, and Stebbins to the north. Just to the northeast is van&#x27;t Hoff.

What remains of the perimeter is now a rugged sloping rise along the inner wall, and the rim has been worn down until it is level with the irregular external terrain. The rim is pock-marked by small craters of various dimensions. Within the crater are several craters that are notable in their own right. Along the northwest inner rim is the eroded Birkhoff X, while due south in the southwest floor is Birkhoff Q. The later is joined by a low ridge to the double crater formation of Birkhoff K and L in the eastern half of the crater. In the northern interior are the smaller but relatively young Birkhoff Y and Z. The remainder of the floor is flat in places, with rough sections and many tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Birkhoff.

<text>Richard Arthur Allan Browne (August 11, 1917 – June 4, 1989) was an American cartoonist, best known for writing and drawing &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; and &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Dik Browne was born on August 11, 1917, in Manhattan. He attended Cooper Union for a year, then started work at the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; as a copy boy. He later worked in the art department, drawing maps and charts.

== Career ==
In 1936, photographers and artists were banned from the Lucky Luciano compulsory prostitution trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;tulsaworld/browne-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/Hagar-creator-dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Browne slipped in undetected, and his courtroom sketches gave the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; a news exclusive on the story.

During World War II, in 1942, Browne joined the United States Army, and was assigned to draw maps and charts for an Army engineering unit, eventually rising to staff sergeant. In his spare time, he created the comic &quot;Ginny Jeep&quot;, a comic strip about the Women&#x27;s Army Corps, appearing in Army and Air Force newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/obit/dik-browne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, he worked as an illustrator for &quot;Newsweek&quot; as well as for Johnstone and Cushing, an advertising company, where, in 1944, he created the Carmen-Miranda-inspired &quot;Miss Chiquita&quot; trademark/logo, for Chiquita, and later, the Birds Eye bird, a Campbell&#x27;s Soup kids redesign, and a Mounds candy bar ad.&lt;ref name=&quot;mentalfloss/69674&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalcartoonists/spotlight-dik-browne&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, he drew The Tracy Twins, a comic strip, for &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;. His work for this strip, and for the &quot;Mounds&quot; candy bar ad, brought him to the attention of King Features Syndicate. 

In 1954, cartoonist Mort Walker, seeing the &quot;Mounds&quot; candy bar ad, enlisted Browne to co-create the comic strip &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;, a spin-off of Walker&#x27;s popular &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; strip, featuring Beetle&#x27;s sister, brother-in-law and their family. Walker wrote the strip, which Browne illustrated until his death. The series was later drawn by his son Chance, deceased in 2024, and written by Walker&#x27;s sons. In 1973, Browne created &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; about an ill-mannered red-bearded medieval viking. The comic was then produced by his son Chris until 2023. Both strips have been successful, appearing in hundreds of newspapers for decades.

== Recognition ==
He got the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s &quot;Best Humor Strip&quot; plaque in 1959, 1960, and 1972, and its Reuben Award as Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year in 1962, for &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;. He was National Cartoonists Society president in 1963. The National Cartoonists Society gave Browne a second Reuben Award for &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; in 1973, and three more Best-Humor Strip awards in 1977, 1984, and 1986. In 1973, the National Cartoonists Society gave him the Elzie Segar Award.

== Personal life ==
Browne and his wife, Joan, had two sons and one daughter. He died of cancer on June 4, 1989, at the age of 71, in Sarasota, Florida.

<doc id="1118354" wikidata="Q2892130" url="?curid=1118354" title="Bowditch (crater)">
<text>Bowditch is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the eastern limb. It is located on a region of the lunar surface that is brought into view due to libration, but at such times the area is viewed from the edge and so not much detail can be observed. It lies just to the north of the small Lacus Solitudinis lunar mare, between the craters Titius to the southwest and Perel&#x27;man to the east-northeast.

The rim of this crater is open to the southwest and the crater is elongated to the northeast, possibly due to a merged crater. The outer rim varies in height, with the most prominent sections being the southwest face and a ridge mount to the northwest. The interior floor has been flooded with basaltic lava, an unusual feature for a crater on the far side. The interior floor is generally flat, and marked by a number of small craters. However, there are some low ridges in the surface that are concentric with the inner wall. A formation of irregular ridges occupies most of the rim gap along the southwest.

Bowditch is described in the Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report, along with Lacus Solitudinis to the south, as a significant volcanic feature:&lt;br&gt;
:On the southwest wall of the oblong crater (Bowditch) is a distinct &quot;strand line,&quot; marking the highest level reached by lava before cooling and withdrawal. A faint trace of this line exists in other parts of the wall. A prominent terrace (around all except the southern part of the outer edges of the floor) marks another state in the subsidence of the lava.

==Nearby craters==

Near the southern rim of this formation, at the northern edge of the Lacus Solitudinus, are four tiny craters that have been assigned individual names by the IAU. These are listed below.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bowditch.

<text>Bragg is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northwest limb. This formation has been heavily eroded and reshaped by subsequent impacts, leaving an irregular depression in the surface. The most intact portion of the rim is along the western face, while the northern and eastern rim has been nearly worn away and is overlaid by several smaller craters. The most notable of these is Bragg H, which lies across the east-southeastern rim.

This crater is located to the north-northwest of the walled plain Lorentz. Nearby craters of note include Rynin to the north, Stefan to the northwest, Lacchini to the west, and Avicenna to the southeast. The region about this crater is very rugged and marked by many smaller impacts.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Bragg was called &quot;Crater 102&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bragg.

<doc id="1118365" wikidata="Q2633344" url="?curid=1118365" title="Bell Gothic">
<text>Bell Gothic is a sans-serif typeface in the industrial or grotesque style designed by Chauncey H. Griffith in 1938 while heading the typographic development program at the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. The typeface was commissioned by AT&amp;T as a proprietary typeface for use in telephone directories and has since been made available for general licensing. Bell Gothic is designed for maximum legibility in the adverse conditions of small print on poor-quality newsprint paper, into which ink tends to absorb and spread out. It is therefore a popular font in printing at small sizes.

Bell Gothic was replaced by AT&amp;T with Matthew Carter&#x27;s typeface Bell Centennial in 1978, the one centennial anniversary of AT&amp;T&#x27;s founding.

Bell Gothic was derived from Monotype Grotesque Std Black typeface.

== Design ==
Earlier in Griffith&#x27;s career at Mergenthaler Linotype, he had developed a highly successful newspaper text face called Excelsior, which overcame many of the limitations of printing smaller point sizes on low quality newsprint. This contributed to his addressing similar limitations of telephone book printing. Bell Gothic was designed to be highly legible at small sizes, economical in its use of space (and hence paper), and reproduce well on uncoated, absorbent paper newsprint stock under less than optimal conditions. Griffith&#x27;s face Bell Gothic is distinct for the cross bars on the uppercase &#x27;I&#x27;, the foot and cross bar on figure &#x27;1&#x27;, and the angled terminus of the stroke on characters &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;h&#x27;, &#x27;k&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27;, and &#x27;q&#x27;. While there are suggestions of an ink trap in several characters, they are minimal in comparison to the exaggerated ones found in Bell Centennial.

== Evolution of use ==
Bell Gothic remained in uninterrupted use for AT&amp;T telephone directories for forty years. Following AT&amp;T&#x27;s adoption of Bell Centennial, the Mergenthaler Linotype foundry licensed Bell Gothic for general use. Beginning in the early 1990s Bell Gothic became popular and associated with avant garde experimentation with type at places like the Cranbrook Academy of Art the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, and RISD. The typeface was used as a display and caption face by &quot;Metropolis&quot; magazine, by Canadian graphic designer Bruce Mau in designing the initial ZONE book series, Dutch graphic designer Irma Boom, and has been widely used by Semiotext(e) Books, the MIT Press, and Dia Art Foundation.

== Revisions ==
Along with Matthew Carter&#x27;s 1978 Bell Centennial reworking, Tobias Frere-Jones designed the &quot;Griffith Gothic&quot; typeface family for the Font Bureau in 1997. Condensed and italic variants were added, thus expanding the family in 2000. Isabella Chæva produced a cyrillic version of Bell Gothic for ParaType, based in Moscow, Russia, in 1999. She added italics in Griffith&#x27;s original style in 2009. &quot;(For specimen showings and further information, see External Links.)&quot;

<text>Gioia is a lunar impact crater that is located in the vicinity of the north pole of the Moon. It is named after the alleged Italian inventor of compass Flavio Gioia. As it lies so close to the northern limb, it is viewed nearly from the edge making difficult to observe from the Earth. The crater is attached to the southern rim of the larger Byrd, a formation with low walls. To the south-southeast is the crater Main.

The rim of Gioia remains nearly circular, but is worn and somewhat eroded. The exterior s have been modified by subsequent impacts, particularly along the western rim. The rim achieves its high point to the northwest, where it has been reinforced by the rim of the crater Byrd and other since-vanished formations. The interior floor is nearly flat, with a low cleft or ridge running from the midpoint to the north-northeast rim. Several tiny craterlets mark the inner floor, most notably a pair near the west-northwestern inner wall.

<doc id="1118379" wikidata="Q212930" url="?curid=1118379" title="Online shopping">
<text>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product&#x27;s availability and pricing at different e-retailers. customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.

An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular &quot;brick-and-mortar&quot; retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm&#x27;s range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices. Unlike physical stores which may close at night, online shopping portals are always available to customers.

Online stores usually enable shoppers to use &quot;search&quot; features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay.

==Terminology==

Alternative names for the activity are &quot;e-commerce&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;electronic commerce&quot; or &quot;e-shopping&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;electronic shopping&quot;. An online store may also be called an e-web-store, e-shop, e-store, Internet shop, web-shop, web-store, online store, online storefront and virtual store. Mobile commerce (or m-commerce) describes purchasing from an online retailer&#x27;s mobile device-optimized website or software application (&quot;app&quot;). These websites or apps are designed to enable customers to browse through a companies&#x27; products and services on tablet computers and smartphones.

==History==
=== History of online shopping ===
One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM&#x27;s online transaction processing (OLTP) developed in the 1960s, which allowed the processing of financial transactions in real-time. The computerized ticket reservation system developed for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications. There, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same time. At some point between 1971 and 1972, students at Stanford and MIT used the internet precursor ARPANET to make a deal to exchange marijuana, but the interaction does not qualify as e-commerce because no money was transferred online.

The landscape of online shopping as we know it today took shape with the rise of the Internet. Initially serving as a mere advertising platform, the Internet transitioned swiftly into a dynamic space for actual online transactions. This transformation was fueled by the development of interactive web pages and secure transmission protocols, marking a pivotal moment in 1994 with the first online sales of Sting&#x27;s album, &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot;.

This milestone event set the stage for the diversification of online retail, with early adopters such as wine, chocolates, and flowers paving the way. These products became pioneers in the e-commerce realm, capturing the attention of a growing audience. Researchers identified a crucial factor for internet success – the suitability of products for online transactions. Generic items that didn&#x27;t necessitate physical interaction gained traction, propelling the online shopping trend forward.

In its nascent stages, online shopping faced a limited audience. The early adopters were predominantly affluent males aged 30 and above. However, this demographic landscape underwent significant changes over time, and the online shopping sphere became more inclusive.

Over the years, the United Kingdom has witnessed a substantial shift in consumer behavior, with online shopping accounting for a noteworthy percentage of retail transactions. The extent of this influence varies depending on the product category, highlighting the diverse ways in which consumers engage with online platforms.

=== Growth in online shoppers ===
As the revenues from online sales continued to grow significantly researchers identified different types of online shoppers, Rohm &amp; Swaninathan identified four categories and named them &quot;convenience shoppers, variety seekers, balanced buyers, and store-oriented shoppers&quot;. They focused on shopping motivations and found that the variety of products available and the perceived convenience of the buying online experience were significant motivating factors. This was different for offline shoppers, who were more motivated by time saving and recreational motives.
English entrepreneur Michael Aldrich was a pioneer of online shopping in 1979. His system connected a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line. He believed that videotex, the modified domestic TV technology with a simple menu-driven human–computer interface, was a &#x27;new, universally applicable, participative communication medium — the first since the invention of the telephone.&#x27; This enabled &#x27;closed&#x27; corporate information systems to be opened to &#x27;outside&#x27; correspondents not just for transaction processing but also for e-messaging and information retrieval and dissemination, later known as e-business. His definition of the new mass communications medium as &#x27;participative&#x27; [interactive, many-to-many] was fundamentally different from the traditional definitions of mass communication and mass media and a precursor to the social networking on the Internet 25 years later. In March 1980 he launched Redifon&#x27;s Office Revolution, which allowed consumers, customers, agents, distributors, suppliers and service companies to be connected online to the corporate systems and allow business transactions to be completed electronically in real-time. During the 1980s he designed, manufactured, sold, installed, maintained and supported many online shopping systems, using videotex technology. These systems which also provided voice response and handprint processing pre-date the Internet and the World Wide Web, the IBM PC, and Microsoft MS-DOS, and were installed mainly in the UK by large corporations.

The first World Wide Web server and browser, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, opened for commercial use in 1991. Thereafter, subsequent technological innovations emerged in 1994: online banking, the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut, Netscape&#x27;s SSL v2 encryption standard for secure data transfer, and Intershop&#x27;s first online shopping system. The first secure retail transaction over the Web was either by NetMarket or Internet Shopping Network in 1994. Immediately after, Amazon.com launched its online shopping site in 1995 and eBay was also introduced in 1995. Alibaba&#x27;s sites Taobao and Tmall were launched in 2003 and 2008, respectively. Retailers are increasingly selling goods and services prior to availability through &quot;pretail&quot; for testing, building, and managing demand.

==International statistics==
Statistics show that in 2012, Asia-Pacific increased their international sales over 30% giving them over $433 billion in revenue. That is a $69 billion difference between the U.S. revenue of $364.66 billion. It is estimated that Asia-Pacific will increase by another 30% in the year 2013 putting them ahead by more than one-third of all global e-commerce sales. The largest online shopping day in the world is Singles Day, with sales just in Alibaba&#x27;s sites at US$9.3 billion in 2014.

In 2018, 9.8% of all retail sales in the United States were made online. In 2019, that figure was 2.8% in Canada.
In the United Kingdom, online sales peaked at 37.8% of all retail sales in January 2021, and were at 26.3% in January 2024.

==Customers==
Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction. Generally, higher levels of education and personal income correspond to more favorable perceptions of shopping online. Increased exposure to technology also increases the probability of developing favorable attitudes towards new shopping channels.

In addition, age is also a significant factor that affects online shopping. People feel that privacy and security factors have an even more significant impact on attitudes toward online shopping than product factors. Shoppers of different age groups have different perceptions of the risk factors of online shopping.

==Customer buying behaviour in digital environment==

The marketing around the digital environment, customer&#x27;s buying behaviour may not be influenced and controlled by the brand and firm, when they make a buying decision that might concern the interactions with search engine, recommendations, online reviews and other information. In modern shopping environments, people are more likely to use their mobile phones, computers, tablets and other digital devices to gather information. In an online shopping environment, interactive decision may have an influence on aid customer decision making, through online product reviews and user-generated content, typically provided through software from companies like Bazaarvoice and Trustpilot, or via social media. This content, which can include text or video-based reviews, customer photos, and feedback, is often displayed alongside products being sold on websites like Amazon, Target, and most other digital storefronts.

Subsequently, risk and trust would also are two important factors affecting people&#x27;s&#x27; behavior in digital environments. Customers consider to switch between e-channels, because they are mainly influence by the comparison with offline shopping, involving growth of security, financial and performance-risks In other words, a customer shopping online that they may receive more risk than people shopping in stores. There are three factors may influence people to do the buying decision, firstly, people cannot examine whether the product satisfy their needs and wants before they receive it. Secondly, customer may concern at after-sale services. Finally, customer may afraid that they cannot fully understand the language used in e-sales. Based on those factors customer perceive risk may as a significantly reason influence the online purchasing behaviour.

Online retailers has place much emphasis on customer trust aspect, trust is another way driving customer&#x27;s behaviour in digital environment, which can depend on customer&#x27;s attitude and expectation. Indeed, the company&#x27;s products design or ideas can not met customer&#x27;s expectations. Customer&#x27;s purchase intention based on rational expectations, and additionally impacts on emotional trust. Moreover, those expectations can be also establish on the product information and revision from others.

In several studies, perceived value, shopping style, and brand trust are the main factors that affect online consumers&#x27; decisions.  The perceived value means that people can compare the products and prices online, bringing them the perceived value of getting more benefits online than in an offline store. The comfortable environment that online shopping brings to customers can make consumers get more perceived value. In the end, E-commerce behavior is still mostly influenced by families that are receptive to new technologies, and to a lesser extent by efficiency concerns. 

==Product selection==

Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine. Users can compare and evaluate products using product information on the website, as well on other websites such as websites about product tests.

Once a particular product has been found and selected on the website of the seller, most online retailers use shopping cart software to allow the consumer to accumulate multiple items and to adjust quantities, like filling a physical shopping cart or basket in a conventional store. A &quot;checkout&quot; process follows (continuing the physical-store analogy) in which payment and delivery information is collected, if necessary. Some stores allow consumers to sign up for a permanent online account so that some or all of this information only needs to be entered once. The consumer often receives an e-mail confirmation once the transaction is complete. Less sophisticated stores may rely on consumers to phone or e-mail their orders (although full credit card numbers, expiry date, and Card Security Code, or bank account and routing number should not be accepted by e-mail, for reasons of security).

===Impact of reviews on consumer behavior===
One of the great benefits of online shopping is the ability to read product reviews, written either by experts or fellow online shoppers. The Nielsen Company conducted a survey in March 2010 and polled more than 27,000 Internet users in 55 markets from the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America to look at questions such as &quot;How do consumers shop online?&quot;, &quot;What do they intend to buy?&quot;, &quot;How do they use various online shopping web pages?&quot;, and the impact of social media and other factors that come into play when consumers are trying to decide how to spend their money on which product or service. According to the research, reviews on electronics (57%) such as DVD players, cellphones, or PlayStations, and so on, reviews on cars (45%), and reviews on software (37%) play an important role in influencing consumers who tend to make purchases online. Furthermore, 40% of online shoppers indicate that they would not even buy electronics without consulting online reviews first.

In addition to online reviews, peer recommendations on online shopping pages or social media websites play a key role for online shoppers when they are researching future purchases. 90% of all purchases made are influenced by social media.

==Payment==
Online shoppers commonly use a credit card or a PayPal account in order to make payments. However, some systems enable users to create accounts and pay by alternative means, such as:

* Billing to mobile phones and landlines
* Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies
* Cash on delivery (C.O.D.)
* Cheque/ Check
* Debit card
* Direct debit in some countries
* Electronic money of various types
* Gift cards
* Invoice, especially popular in some markets/countries, such as Switzerland
* Postal money order
* Wire transfer/delivery on payment

Some online shops will not accept international credit cards. Some require both the purchaser&#x27;s billing and shipping address to be in the same country as the online shop&#x27;s base of operation. Other online shops allow customers from any country to send gifts anywhere. The financial part of a transaction may be processed in real time (e.g. letting the consumer know their credit card was declined before they log off), or may be done later as part of the fulfillment process.

==Product delivery==

Once a payment has been accepted, the goods or services can be delivered in the following ways. For physical items:
* Package delivery: The product is shipped to a customer-designated address. Retail package delivery is typically done by the public postal system or a retail courier such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or TNT.
* Drop shipping: The order is passed to the manufacturer or third-party distributor, who then ships the item directly to the consumer, bypassing the retailer&#x27;s physical location to save time, money, and space.
* In-store pick-up: The customer selects a local store using a locator software and picks up the delivered product at the selected location. This is the method often used in the bricks and clicks business model.

For digital items or tickets:
* Downloading/Digital distribution: The method often used for digital media products such as software, music, movies, or images.
* Printing out, provision of a code for, or e-mailing of such items as admission tickets and scrip (e.g., gift certificates and coupons). The tickets, codes, or coupons may be redeemed at the appropriate physical or online premises and their content reviewed to verify their eligibility (e.g., assurances that the right of admission or use is redeemed at the correct time and place, for the correct dollar amount, and for the correct number of uses).
* Will call, COBO (in Care Of Box Office), or &quot;at the door&quot; pickup: The patron picks up pre-purchased tickets for an event, such as a play, sporting event, or concert, either just before the event or in advance. With the onset of the Internet and e-commerce sites, which allow customers to buy tickets online, the popularity of this service has increased.

==Shopping cart systems==

Simple shopping cart systems allow the off-line administration of products and categories. The shop is then generated as HTML files and graphics that can be uploaded to a webspace. The systems do not use an online database. A high-end solution can be bought or rented as a stand-alone program or as an addition to an enterprise resource planning program. It is usually installed on the company&#x27;s web server and may integrate into the existing supply chain so that ordering, payment, delivery, accounting and warehousing can be automated to a large extent. Other solutions allow the user to register and create an online shop on a portal that hosts multiple shops simultaneously from one back office. Examples are BigCommerce, Shopify and FlickRocket. Open source shopping cart packages include advanced platforms such as Interchange, and off-the-shelf solutions such as Magento, osCommerce, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and Zen Cart. Commercial systems can also be tailored so the shop does not have to be created from scratch. By using an existing framework, software modules for various functionalities required by a web shop can be adapted and combined.

==Design==
Customers are attracted to online shopping not only because of high levels of convenience, but also because of broader selections, competitive pricing, and greater access to information. Business organizations seek to offer online shopping not only because it is of much lower cost compared to bricks and mortar stores, but also because it offers access to a worldwide market, increases customer value, and builds sustainable capabilities.

===Information load===
Designers of online shops are concerned with the effects of information load. Information load is a product of the spatial and temporal arrangements of stimuli in the web store. Compared with conventional retail shopping, the information environment of virtual shopping is enhanced by providing additional product information such as comparative products and services, as well as various alternatives and attributes of each alternative, etc. Two major dimensions of information load are complexity and novelty. Complexity refers to the number of different elements or features of a site, often the result of increased information diversity. Novelty involves the unexpected, suppressed, new, or unfamiliar aspects of the site. The novelty dimension may keep consumers exploring a shopping site, whereas the complexity dimension may induce impulse purchases.

===Consumer needs and expectations===
Internet consumers are self-conscious and emphasize personalized consumption, which makes the demand for online consumption different. Online consumers have different needs depending on their time and environment. Even different online consumers have different needs at the same level of demand due to the difference in income level and other factors. Compared with the centralized nature of traditional markets, online consumption is more decentralized. In the online consumer market, consumers have a short decision time, a large variability of consumer demand, a large number of purchases, but a relatively small amount of each purchase, a considerable mobility of purchases, a strong substitutability of goods, and a large elasticity of demand. According to the output of a research report by Western Michigan University published in 2005, an e-commerce website does not have to be good looking with listing on a lot of search engines. It must build relationships with customers to make money. The report also suggests that a website must leave a positive impression on the customers, giving them a reason to come back. However, resent research has proven that sites with higher focus on efficiency, convenience, and personalised services increased the customers motivation to make purchases.

Dyn, an Internet performance management company conducted a survey on more than 1400 consumers across 11 countries in North America, Europe, Middle-East and Asia and the results of the survey are as follows:
* Online retailers must improve the website speed
* Online retailers must ease consumers fear around security

These concerns majorly affect the decisions of almost two thirds of the consumers.

===User interface===

The most important factors determining whether customers return to a website are ease of use and the presence of user-friendly features. Usability testing is important for finding problems and improvements in a web site. Methods for evaluating usability include heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, and user testing. Each technique has its own characteristics and emphasizes different aspects of the user experience.

==Market share==
The popularity of online shopping continues to erode sales of conventional retailers. For example, Best Buy, the largest retailer of electronics in the U.S. in August 2014 reported its tenth consecutive quarterly dip in sales, citing an increasing shift by consumers to online shopping. Amazon.com has the largest market share in the United States. As of May 2018, a survey found two-thirds of Americans had bought something from Amazon (92% of those who had bought anything online), with 40% of online shoppers buying something from Amazon at least once a month. The survey found shopping began at amazon.com 44% of the time, compared to a general search engine at 33%. It estimated 75 million Americans subscribe to Amazon Prime and 35 million more use someone else&#x27;s account.

There were 242 million people shopping online in China in 2012. For developing countries and low-income households in developed countries, adoption of e-commerce in place of or in addition to conventional methods is limited by a lack of affordable Internet access.

==Advantages==

===Convenience===
Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home. Other establishments such as Internet cafes, community centers and schools provide internet access as well. In contrast, visiting a conventional retail store requires travel or commuting and costs such as gas, parking, or bus tickets, and must usually take place during business hours. Delivery was always a problem which affected the convenience of online shopping. Additionally, the online shopping industry has not only involved the concept of providing convenience for customers but also improved perceptions of social inclusion. However to overcome this many retailers including online retailers in Taiwan brought in a store pick up service. This now meant that customers could purchase goods online and pick them up at a nearby convenience store, making online shopping more advantageous to customers. In the event of a problem with the item (e.g., the product was not what the consumer ordered or the product was not satisfactory), consumers are concerned with the ease of returning an item in exchange for the correct product or a refund. Consumers may need to contact the retailer, visit the post office and pay return shipping, and then wait for a replacement or refund. Some online companies have more generous return policies to compensate for the traditional advantage of physical stores. For example, the online shoe retailer Zappos.com includes labels for free return shipping, and does not charge a restocking fee, even for returns which are not the result of merchant error. (Note: In the United Kingdom, online shops are prohibited from charging a restocking fee if the consumer cancels their order in accordance with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Act 2000). A 2018 survey in the United States found 26% of online shoppers said they never return items, and another 65% said they rarely do so. Merchants may benefit from online shopping due to low sales inventory pressure, low operating costs, and the scale of operation is not limited by the site.

===Delivery===
Especially in cases of large or heavy products, delivery can be not only more convenient but also not require having or using a car. Not using or depending on personal vehicles, which can have substantial impact on the environment, to travel to local stores can make online shopping more sustainable than buying in local stores if such are used otherwise (especially if items are bundled and delivery vehicles are electric and use optimized routes). Moreover, the pace of urbanization, local delivery systems, and internet connectivity which facilitate the delivery process are the major determinants of e-commerce adoption,

===Information and reviews===
Online shopping is usually more informationally rich than shopping at physical stores traveled to and usually has higher comparability and customizability.

Online stores must describe products for sale with text, photos, and multimedia files, and sometimes have features such as question and answers or filters, whereas in a physical retail store, the actual product and the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging will be available for direct inspection (which might involve a test drive, fitting, or other experimentation). Some online stores provide or link to supplemental product information, such as instructions, safety procedures, demonstrations, or manufacturer specifications. Some provide background information, advice, or how-to guides designed to help consumers decide which product to buy. Some stores even allow customers to comment or rate their items. There are also dedicated review sites that host user reviews for different products. Reviews and even some blogs give customers the option of shopping for cheaper purchases from all over the world without having to depend on local retailers. In a conventional retail store, clerks are generally available to answer questions. Some online stores have real-time chat features, but most rely on e-mails or phone calls to handle customer questions. Even if an online store is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the customer service team may only be available during regular business hours. It also implies that geographical factors, rather than socioeconomic issues, must be addressed in order to improve online shopping acceptance.

===Price and selection===
One advantage of shopping online is being able to quickly seek out deals for items or services provided by many different vendors (though some local search engines do exist to help consumers locate products for sale in nearby stores). Search engines, online price comparison services and discovery shopping engines can be used to look up sellers of a particular product or service. Shipping costs (if applicable) reduce the price advantage of online merchandise, though depending on the jurisdiction, a lack of sales tax may compensate for this. Shipping a small number of items, especially from another country, is much more expensive than making the larger shipments bricks-and-mortar retailers order. Some retailers (especially those selling small, high-value items like electronics) offer free shipping on sufficiently large orders. Another major advantage for retailers is the ability to rapidly switch suppliers and vendors without disrupting users&#x27; shopping experience.

==Disadvantages==

===Fraud and security concerns===
Given the lack of ability to inspect merchandise before purchase, consumers are at higher risk of fraud than face-to-face transactions. When ordering merchandise online, the item may not work properly, it may have defects, or it might not be the same item pictured in the online photo. Merchants also risk fraudulent purchases if customers are using stolen credit cards or fraudulent repudiation of the online purchase. However, merchants face less risk from physical theft by using a warehouse instead of a retail storefront. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption has generally solved the problem of credit card numbers being intercepted in transit between the consumer and the merchant. However, one must still trust the merchant (and employees) not to use the credit card information subsequently for their own purchases, and not to pass the information to others. Also, hackers might break into a merchant&#x27;s web site and steal names, addresses and credit card numbers, although the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is intended to minimize the impact of such breaches. Identity theft is still a concern for consumers. A number of high-profile break-ins in the 2000s has prompted some U.S. states to require disclosure to consumers when this happens. Computer security has thus become a major concern for merchants and e-commerce service providers, who deploy countermeasures such as firewalls and anti-virus software to protect their networks. Phishing is another danger, where consumers are fooled into thinking they are dealing with a reputable retailer, when they have actually been manipulated into feeding private information to a system operated by a malicious party. Denial of service attacks are a minor risk for merchants, as are server and network outages.

Quality seals can be placed on the Shop web page if it has undergone an independent assessment and meets all requirements of the company issuing the seal. The purpose of these seals is to increase the confidence of online shoppers. However, the existence of many different seals, or seals unfamiliar to consumers, may foil this effort to a certain extent.

A number of resources offer advice on how consumers can protect themselves when using online retailer services. These include:
* Sticking with well-known stores, or attempting to find independent consumer reviews of their experiences; also ensuring that there is comprehensive contact information on the website before using the service, and noting if the retailer has enrolled in industry oversight programs such as a trust mark or a trust seal.
* Before buying from a new company, evaluating the website by considering issues such as: the professionalism and user-friendliness of the site; whether or not the company lists a telephone number and/or street address along with e-contact information; whether a fair and reasonable refund and return policy is clearly stated; and whether there are hidden price inflators, such as excessive shipping and handling charges.
* Ensuring that the retailer has an acceptable privacy policy posted. For example, note if the retailer does not explicitly state that it will not share private information with others without consent.
* Ensuring that the vendor address is protected with SSL (see above) when entering credit card information. If it does the address on the credit card information entry screen will start with &quot;HTTPS&quot;.
* Using strong passwords which do not contain personal information such as the user&#x27;s name or birthdate. Another option is a &quot;pass phrase,&quot; which might be something along the lines: &quot;I shop 4 good a buy!!&quot; These are difficult to hack, since they do not consist of words found in a dictionary, and provides a variety of upper, lower, and special characters. These passwords can be site specific and may be easy to remember.

Although the benefits of online shopping are considerable, when the process goes poorly it can create a thorny situation. A few problems that shoppers potentially face include identity theft, faulty products, and the accumulation of spyware. If users are required to put in their credit card information and billing/shipping address and the website is not secure, customer information can be accessible to anyone who knows how to obtain it. Most large online corporations are inventing new ways to make fraud more difficult. However, criminals are constantly responding to these developments with new ways to manipulate the system. Even though online retailers are making efforts to protect consumer information, it is a constant fight to maintain the lead. It is advisable to be aware of the most current technology and scams to protect consumer identity and finances. Product delivery is also a main concern of online shopping. Most companies offer shipping insurance in case the product is lost or damaged. Some shipping companies will offer refunds or compensation for the damage, but this is up to their discretion.

===Fencing===
Fencing is another growing societal problem associated with online platforms. Stolen merchandise from brick and mortal retailers and cargo are easily resold to the public through third party marketplaces due to lack of accountability and regulation by online operators. In the United States alone, businesses are facing the brunt of organized retail crime with the value of stolen goods amounting to $68.8 billion in 2021 (equivalent to 1.47% of all sales or $214 per capita nationwide). These goods are typically passed off as legitimate, and resold online to unsuspecting buyers.

===Lack of full cost disclosure===
The lack of full cost disclosure may also be problematic. While it may be easy to compare the base price of an item online, it may not be easy to see the total cost up front. Additional fees such as shipping are often not visible until the final step in the checkout process. The problem is especially evident with cross-border purchases, where the cost indicated at the final checkout screen may not include additional fees that must be paid upon delivery such as duties and brokerage. Some services such as the Canadian-based Wishabi attempts to include estimates of these additional cost, but nevertheless, the lack of general full cost disclosure remains a concern.

===Privacy===
Privacy of personal information is a significant issue for some consumers. Many consumers wish to avoid spam and telemarketing which could result from supplying contact information to an online merchant. In response, many merchants promise to not use consumer information for these purposes, Many websites keep track of consumer shopping habits in order to suggest items and other websites to view. Brick-and-mortar stores also collect consumer information. Some ask for a shopper&#x27;s address and phone number at checkout, though consumers may refuse to provide it. Many larger stores use the address information encoded on consumers&#x27; credit cards (often without their knowledge) to add them to a catalog mailing list. This information is obviously not accessible to the merchant when paying in cash or through a bank (money transfer, in which case there is also proof of payment).

==Product suitability==

Many successful purely virtual companies deal with digital products, (including information storage, retrieval, and modification), music, movies, office supplies, education, communication, software, photography, and financial transactions. Other successful marketers use drop shipping or affiliate marketing techniques to facilitate transactions of tangible goods without maintaining real inventory. Some non-digital products have been more successful than others for online stores. Profitable items often have a high value-to-weight ratio, they may involve embarrassing purchases, they may typically go to people in remote locations, and they may have shut-ins as their typical purchasers. Items which can fit in a standard mailbox—such as music CDs, DVDs and books—are particularly suitable for a virtual marketer.

Products such as spare parts, both for consumer items like washing machines and for industrial equipment like centrifugal pumps, also seem good candidates for selling online. Retailers often need to order spare parts specially, since they typically do not stock them at consumer outlets—in such cases, e-commerce solutions in spares do not compete with retail stores, only with other ordering systems. A factor for success in this niche can consist of providing customers with exact, reliable information about which part number their particular version of a product needs, for example by providing parts lists keyed by serial number. Products less suitable for e-commerce include products that have a low value-to-weight ratio, products that have a smell, taste, or touch component, products that need trial fittings—most notably clothing—and products where colour integrity appears important. Nonetheless, some web sites have had success delivering groceries and clothing sold through the internet is big business in the U.S.

==Aggregation==
High-volume websites, such as Yahoo!, Amazon.com and eBay offer hosting services for online stores to all size retailers. These stores are presented within an integrated navigation framework, sometimes known as virtual shopping malls or online marketplaces.

<doc id="1118382" wikidata="Q16932560" url="?curid=1118382" title="Sports Illustrated for Women">
<text>Sports Illustrated Women (previously called Sports Illustrated for Women) and also known as &quot;SI Women&quot;, was a bimonthly sports magazine covering (according to its statement of purpose) &quot;the sports that women play and what they want to follow&quot;, from basketball to tennis, soccer to volleyball, field hockey to ice hockey and figure skating and more. It featured real athletes, told their real stories and gave the real scoop on women&#x27;s sports. &quot;Sports Illustrated for Women&quot; was published by Time Inc.&quot; It ran for 20 issues, between March 2000 and November 2002, targeting an audience of women, 18–34 years old, with &quot;a passion for sports&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Sports Illustrated for Women&quot;, renamed &quot;Sports Illustrated Women&quot; (&quot;SI Women&quot;) in 2001, launched under the leadership of Cleary Simpson, Group Publisher and Sandy Bailey, Editor in Chief. &quot;SI Women&quot; initially ran test publications as &quot;Sports Illustrated Women/Sport&quot;, in 1997. The test magazine was published in two issues, followed by four special issues in 1999, under the title &quot;Sports Illustrated Women&quot;. In January 2000, Paula Romano joined as Publisher and helped redefine the magazine. The March 2000 launch of the ongoing product, slated for six issues per year, included a website, siforwomen.com. Circulation base rate was estimated at 300,000. By 2002 it had reached 400,000. Its newsstand price was $3.50. Publishers Information Bureau statistics showed that &quot;SI Women&quot;″s ad pages jumped 26.51 percent from 2000 to 2001 and its revenues increased 73.28 percent, from $5,499,509 to $9,529,281.

The magazine went through a makeover and name change (to &quot;SI Women&quot;) in September 2001, after Susan Casey, former Editor of &quot;Outside&quot;, took over from Sandy Bailey, as Editor in Chief. Research showed that, &quot;women are more interested in sports as participants than fans, unlike men.&quot; That year, the magazine expanded, planning 10 issues per year and revamping its content to, &quot;a wider range of activities pursued by today&#x27;s modern, active women,&quot; including participatory sports with sections on training and adventure travel. In 2002, &quot;SI Women&quot; received a nomination for General Excellence from the National Magazine Awards.

==Last issue==
On 14 October 2002, &quot;SI Women&quot; announced that December 2002 would be its last issue. President Ann S. Moore cited the downturn in the ad economy, stating, &quot;&quot;SI Women&quot; needed a significant investment to reach its potential&quot;, and, &quot;The investment climate was simply not on our side.&quot;

Born a member of the Corbet family he was the son of Sir Thomas Corbet of Sprowston, Norfolk and the younger brother of Sir John Corbet, 1st Baronet, MP for Great Yarmouth from 1625 to 1629. He entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was appointed Recorder of Great Yarmouth.

After the restoration of King Charles II in 1660, the castle was returned to its ancestral owners. All the 59 men who had signed the death warrant of Charles I were in grave danger of severe punishment because they were considered regicides. Miles Corbet, like many of them, fled England. He went to the Netherlands where he thought he would be safe. However, along with two other regicides, John Okey and John Barkstead, he was arrested by the English ambassador to the Netherlands, Sir George Downing, and returned to England under guard. After a trial, Corbet was found guilty, and executed on 19 April 1662. In his dying speech he said:

<doc id="1118391" wikidata="Q2566606" url="?curid=1118391" title="Young Hercules">
<text>Young Hercules is a prequel series to the television series &quot;&quot; that originally aired on Fox Kids Network. After a pilot film aired on Feb. 17, 1998, the series premiered on September 12, 1998 and ended on May 14, 1999, with a total of 50 episodes over the course of 1 season. It stars Ryan Gosling in the title role, who took over from Ian Bohen who starred in the pilot movie and four episodes of &quot;&quot;. The series was inspired by the Greek myths of Heracles.

==Plot==

The show features the efforts of Ares, the god of war, played by Kevin Tod Smith, who attempts often to destroy his younger half-brother to win over Zeus&#x27; good graces. Among his group is his nephew Strife (Joel Tobeck), who is the rather weaker member of the team. Strife&#x27;s mother is Discord, goddess of retribution (Meighan Desmond), who acts more level-headed and power hungry than her counterpart on more than one occasion. The series has two other villains: Hera, queen of the gods and Hercules&#x27; stepmother; and Apollo, god of the sun and Hercules&#x27; half-brother.

The series follows Hercules (Ryan Gosling) as he attends Cheiron&#x27;s Academy to train in the arts of the warrior under the wise headmaster Cheiron the Centaur (Nathaniel Lees). He makes friends with the future king of Corinth, Prince Jason (Chris Conrad) and a thieving former member of a bandit group named Iolaus (Dean O&#x27;Gorman), who was sentenced to train at the academy as an alternative to prison for his crimes. Hercules also meets the academy&#x27;s first female cadet, Lilith (Jodie Rimmer). Other characters of interest include Kora, the innkeeper who (unknown to Hercules and his friends) is a devotee of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt. As the series develops, Kora is revealed to have special powers which allow her to do Artemis&#x27; bidding. There are hints of romance between Hercules and Kora, although their friendship keeps it all innocent.

==Cast==

===Main===
* Ian Bohen as Hercules (pilot only)
* Ryan Gosling as Hercules
* Dean O&#x27;Gorman as Iolaus 
* Chris Conrad as Jason

===Supporting===
* Jodie Rimmer as Lilith
* Mfundo Morrison as Theseus
* Nathaniel Lees as Cheiron
* Angela Marie Dotchin as Kora
* Kevin Smith as Ares
* Joel Tobeck as Strife
* Meighan Desmond as Discord
* Katrina Browne as Cyane, an Amazon
* Jason Hoyte as Hephaestus, god of metallurgy

==Production==
&quot;Young Hercules&quot;&#x27; executive producers were Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi. Liz Friedman and Eric Gruendemann were co-executive producers, and former MTV producer Cynthia Hsiung was producer of the series. Eric Lewald and Julia Lewald were head writers. In New Zealand, where principal photography was shot, Janine Dickins held down the fort as the New Zealand producer while three series directors took turns shooting the episodes in blocks of four along with a fourth director for second unit. Chris Graves, Charlie Haskell and Andrew Merrifield shot principal photography and Simon Rabbi shot second unit. Later in the series, Simon Rabbi shot principal photography for the 50th episode, &quot;Valley of the Shadow.&quot;

The series has been used in case studies of how to shoot television series efficiently. Traditional television series are shot one episode at a time. &quot;Young Hercules&quot; was shot in blocks of four episodes at a time. The three main directors of the series were on a rotation, one director for each four episode block. The four would be written with this in mind, keeping sets, locations, and actors similar in all four episodes even if story and plot lines might not interrelate. This saved tremendous amounts of money and time allowing the series to be shot on a shoestring budget, but with maximum on-screen dollars. The 50 episodes had a budget of roughly $20 million which includes above and below the line costs. Shooting in New Zealand also allowed the series to circumvent considerable Guild regulations for further savings. Additional money was saved shooting the series on 16 mm film. Early research was done to see if digital cameras could be used, but it was determined that technology was not adequate at the time to make digital filming economically viable.

Principal photography took place in New Zealand while post-production elements including visual effects and music were all edited and integrated together in Los Angeles. Ian Bohen played Young Hercules in the pilot movie and was offered the part, but opted not to move to New Zealand where the series would shoot principal photography. Early on in the series, special visual effects were conceived by Richard Taylor&#x27;s Weta Workshop, the then little known visual effects company that went on to win several Academy Awards for their work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Weta and Richard Taylor stepped off &quot;Young Hercules&quot; early on to work on &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. In fact, the early production days of &quot;Young Hercules&quot; saw many of its crew leave to work on the then little known Peter Jackson sensation, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Ryan Gosling was only 17 when he was cast in the lead role. To train for the role, Ryan took intense martial arts classes by the same trainer who taught Lucy Lawless and Kevin Sorbo. He was so tall and thin that his costume had to be reworked to minimize the look of how thin he was. Original costume sketches showed a darker upper body costume. When Gosling was cast, the costume designers made the upper body of his costume lighter in color and broader in the chest to help create a more bulky look. Makeup was used on Gosling&#x27;s arms to help add muscle contours. Similar tricks were used for both Sorbo and Lawless for their characters.

It was known to be only superficially faithful to Greek mythology, as was its predecessor; it uses similar characters, but in a variety of stories, some of which contain anachronisms.

===Location===
The series was filmed entirely in New Zealand, at Studio West in West Auckland.

==Episodes==
The series was aired out of order. The episodes are listed below, as presented on DVD, in the order of their production codes. Despite this, the episodes list is not completely correct chronologically. For example, in &quot;The Head That Wears the Crown&quot; Jason is crowned king, yet in several following episodes, such as &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, he is still a prince. Similarly, even though Lilith visits Hercules&#x27; mother in &quot;Mommy Dearests&quot;, they later appear to meet for the first time in &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;.

==Reception==
The series aired on the Fox Kids Network at first on Monday through Friday at 4:30 p.m. PST and Saturday mornings at 8:30 a.m. PST. Later in the year, the series aired Monday through Friday only at 3:30 p.m. PST. Although ratings on Fox Kids were strong for the season (2nd top-rated live-action series below &quot;Power Rangers&quot;), &quot;Young Hercules&quot; was not renewed.

===Awards===
===Daytime Emmy Award===
===Writers Guild of America Award===
==Home media==
On June 23, 2015, Shout! Factory released &quot;Young Hercules- The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.

<doc id="1118396" wikidata="Q284681" url="?curid=1118396" title="Chicago Pile-1">
<text>Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) was the world&#x27;s first artificial nuclear reactor. On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 during an experiment led by Enrico Fermi. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement for the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create nuclear weapons during World War II. Developed by the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, CP-1 was built under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. Although the project&#x27;s civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they trusted Fermi&#x27;s safety calculations and decided they could carry out the experiment in a densely populated area. Fermi described the reactor as &quot;a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers&quot;.

After a series of attempts, the successful reactor was assembled in November 1942 by a team of about 30 that, in addition to Fermi, included scientists Leo Szilard (who had previously formulated an idea for non-fission chain reaction), Leona Woods, Herbert L. Anderson, Walter Zinn, Martin D. Whitaker, and George Weil. The reactor used natural uranium. This required a very large amount of material in order to reach criticality, along with graphite used as a neutron moderator. The reactor contained 45,000 ultra-pure graphite blocks weighing and was fueled by of uranium metal and of uranium oxide. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it operated at very low power – about one-half watt; nonetheless, the reactor&#x27;s success meant that a chain reaction could be controlled and the nuclear reaction studied and put to use.

The pursuit of a reactor had been touched off by concern that Nazi Germany had a substantial scientific lead. The success of Chicago Pile-1 in producing the chain reaction provided the first vivid demonstration of the feasibility of the military use of nuclear energy by the Allies, as well as the reality of the danger that Nazi Germany could succeed in producing nuclear weapons. Previously, estimates of critical masses had been crude calculations, leading to order-of-magnitude uncertainties about the size of a hypothetical bomb. The successful use of graphite as a moderator paved the way for progress in the Allied effort, whereas the German program languished partly because of the belief that scarce and expensive heavy water would have to be used for that purpose. The Germans had failed to account for the importance of boron and cadmium impurities in the graphite samples on which they ran their test of its usability as a moderator, while Leo Szilard and Enrico Fermi had asked suppliers about the most common contaminations of graphite after a first failed test. They consequently ensured that the next test would be run with graphite entirely devoid of them. As it turned out, both boron and cadmium were strong neutron poisons.

In 1943, CP-1 was moved to Site A, a wartime research facility near Chicago, where it was reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated for research until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957 and a memorial quadrangle now marks the experiment site&#x27;s location, which is now a National Historic Landmark and a Chicago Landmark.

==Origins==
The idea of a chemical chain reaction was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules that can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, and also entertained the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by their collaborators Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.

In order for a chain reaction to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi collaborated with Americans John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack to conduct the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and he persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.

Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi urged Alfred O. C. Nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and, on 29 February 1940, Nier separated the first uranium-235 sample, which, after being mailed to Dunning at Columbia, was confirmed to be the isolated fissile material. When he was working in Rome, Italy, Fermi had discovered that collisions between neutrons and neutron moderators can slow the neutrons, and thereby make them more likely to be captured by uranium nuclei, causing the uranium to fission. Szilard suggested to Fermi that they use carbon in the form of graphite as a moderator. As a back-up plan, he considered heavy water. This contained deuterium, which would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, and was a better neutron moderator than carbon; but heavy water was expensive and difficult to produce, and several tons of it might be needed. Fermi estimated that a fissioning uranium nucleus produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. (Today the average number of neutrons emitted per fissioning uranium-235 nucleus is known to be about 2.4).

Szilard estimated he would need about of graphite and of uranium. In December 1940, Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and Victor C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, and the procurement of graphite of a purity that had never been produced commercially. National Carbon, a chemical company, had taken the then unusual step of hiring MacPherson, a physicist, to research carbon arc lamps, a major commercial use for graphite at that time. Because of his work studying the spectroscopy of the carbon arc, MacPherson knew that the major relevant contaminant was boron, both because of its concentration and its affinity for absorbing neutrons, confirming a suspicion of Szilard&#x27;s. More importantly, MacPherson and Hamister believed that techniques for producing graphite of a sufficient purity could be developed. Had Fermi and Szilard not consulted MacPherson and Hamister, they might have concluded, incorrectly, as the Germans did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator.

Over the next two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie developed thermal purification techniques for the large scale production of low boron content graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite (&quot;Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature&quot;) by National Carbon. With a neutron absorption cross section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true nuclear-grade graphite. By November 1942, National Carbon had shipped of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago, where it became the primary source of graphite to be used in the construction of Chicago Pile-1.

==Government support==
Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of a German nuclear weapon project, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The Einstein–Szilard letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist and the director of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939 was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the U.S. Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite.
In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) created a special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the University of Chicago, to report on the uranium program. Compton&#x27;s report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October, he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.

Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic mass numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be fissile. In May 1941, Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg produced 28 μg of plutonium-239 in the cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced in cyclotrons, and it was not possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.

The final draft of Compton&#x27;s November 1941 report made no mention of plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.

==Development==

In a nuclear reactor, criticality is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including both neutron absorption and neutron leakage. When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons. In the simplest case of an unreflected, homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be approximately:
&lt;/math&gt;,}}
where &quot;M&quot; is the average distance that a neutron travels before it is absorbed, and &quot;k&quot; is the average neutron multiplication factor. The neutrons in succeeding reactions will be amplified by a factor &quot;k&quot;, the second generation of fission events will produce &quot;k2&quot;, the third &quot;k3&quot; and so on. In order for a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction to occur, &quot;k&quot; must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, &quot;k&quot; must be greater than 1 without crossing the prompt critical threshold that would result in a rapid, exponential increase in the number of fission events.

Fermi christened his apparatus a &quot;pile&quot;. Emilio Segrè later recalled that:

Another grant, this time of $40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was long, wide and high. This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that:
The pile was built in September 1941 from graphite blocks and tinplate iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about . There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A radium-beryllium neutron source was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia&#x27;s football team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing &quot;k&quot; of 0.87.

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.

Before leaving for Chicago, Fermi&#x27;s team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes long and in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture. The result was a &quot;k&quot; of 0.918.

==Choice of site==

In Chicago, Samuel K. Allison had found a suitable location long, wide and high, sunk slightly below ground level, in a space under the stands at Stagg Field originally built as a rackets court. Stagg Field had been largely unused since the University of Chicago had given up playing American football in 1939, but the rackets courts under West Stands were still used for playing squash and handball. Leona Woods and Anthony L. Turkevich played squash there in 1940. Since it was intended for strenuous exercise, the area was unheated, and very cold in the winter. The nearby North Stands had a pair of ice skating rinks on the ground floor, which although they were unrefrigerated, seldom melted in winter. Allison used the rackets court area to construct a experimental pile before Fermi&#x27;s group arrived in 1942.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory became part of what came to be called the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory for the first time on 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.

Fermi designed a new pile, which would be spherical to maximize &quot;k&quot;, which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality. Leona Woods was detailed to build boron trifluoride neutron detectors as soon as she completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the required large number of timbers at lumber yards in Chicago&#x27;s south side. Shipments of high-purity graphite arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity uranium dioxide from Mallinckrodt in St Louis, Missouri, which was now producing a month. Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques.

On 25 June, the Army and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) had selected a site in the Argonne Forest near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant; this became known as &quot;Site A&quot;. were leased from Cook County in August, but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere. The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile—a fully functional nuclear reactor—at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi&#x27;s experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi&#x27;s new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.
The risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States&#x27; major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.

Fermi argued that by using the delayed neutrons, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.

Compton later explained that:

Compton informed Groves of his decision at the 14 November meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee. Although Groves &quot;had serious misgivings about the wisdom of Compton&#x27;s suggestion&quot;, he did not interfere. James B. Conant, the chairman of the NDRC, was reported to have turned white. But because of the urgency and their confidence in Fermi&#x27;s calculations, no one objected. 

==Construction==
Chicago Pile-1 was encased within a balloon so that the air inside could be replaced by carbon dioxide. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. A cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project&#x27;s AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked. A block and tackle was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942. The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.

The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. For a work force they hired thirty high school dropouts who were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the military. They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide. The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of , each weighing . A lathe was used to drill holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into &quot;pseudospheres&quot;, cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour. Graphite dust soon filled the air and made the floor slippery.

Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was responsible for instrumentation. They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a variable resistor, controlling an electric motor that would the clothesline wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail-safe and return to its zero position when released.
About two layers were laid per shift. Woods&#x27; boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift. Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the Ames Project at Iowa State University, where Harley Wilhelm and his team had developed a new process to produce uranium metal. Westinghouse Lamp Plant supplied , which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process.

The metallic uranium cylinders, known as &quot;Spedding&#x27;s eggs&quot;, were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi&#x27;s new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom. Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, high, wide at the ends and across the middle. It contained of uranium metal, of uranium oxide and of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million. According to Robert Crease, CP-1 and preceding piles were &quot;the largest unbonded masonry structures since the pyramids.&quot;

==First nuclear chain reaction==

The next day, 2 December 1942, everybody assembled for the experiment. There were 49 scientists present. Although most of the S-1 Executive Committee was in Chicago, only Crawford Greenewalt was present, at Compton&#x27;s invitation. Other dignitaries present included Szilard, Wigner and Spedding. Fermi, Compton, Anderson and Zinn gathered around the controls on the balcony, which was originally intended as a viewing platform. Samuel Allison stood ready with a bucket of concentrated cadmium nitrate, which he was to throw over the pile in the event of an emergency. The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector in a loud voice, George Weil, the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it at a time, with measurements being taken at each step.

The process was abruptly halted by the automatic control rod reinserting itself, due to its trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then announced that it was lunch time.

The experiment resumed at 14:00. Weil worked the final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi announced that the pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electric current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.

Compton notified Conant by telephone. The conversation was in an impromptu code:
==Later operation==

On 12 December 1942, CP-1&#x27;s power output was increased to . Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity, and further testing was continued at 0.5 W. Operation was terminated on 28 February 1943, and the pile was dismantled and moved to Site A in the Argonne Forest, now known as Red Gate Woods. There the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about tall with a base approximately square. It was surrounded by concrete walls thick that acted as a radiation shielding, with overhead protection from of lead and of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained of uranium and of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a &quot;k&quot; of 1.055. During the war, Walter Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments. CP-2 was joined by Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944.
The reactors were used to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 over the course of a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.

Though the design was held secret for a decade, Szilard and Fermi jointly patented it, with an initial filing date of 19 December 1944 as the &quot;neutronic reactor&quot; no. 2,708,656.

The Red Gate Woods later became the original site of Argonne National Laboratory, which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director. CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954. Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to Chicago Pile-5 at the Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s new site in DuPage County, and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. Some of the graphite blocks from CP-1/CP-2 were reused in the reflector of the TREAT reactor. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for disposal. The rest was encased in concrete and buried in a trench in what is now known as the Site A/Plot M Disposal Site. It is marked by a commemorative boulder.
By the 1970s, there was increased public concern about the levels of radioactivity at the site, which was used for recreation by local residents. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found strontium-90 in the soil at Plot M, trace amounts of tritium in nearby wells, and plutonium, technetium, caesium, and uranium in the area. In 1994, the United States Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory yielded to public pressure and earmarked $24.7 million and $3.4 million respectively to rehabilitate the site. As part of the cleanup, of radioactive waste was removed and sent to the Hanford Site for disposal. By 2002, the Illinois Department of Public Health had determined that the remaining materials posed no danger to public health.

==Significance and commemoration==

The successful test of CP-1 not only proved that a nuclear reactor was feasible, it demonstrated that the &quot;k&quot; factor was larger than originally thought. This removed the objections to the use of air or water as a coolant rather than expensive helium. It also meant that there was greater latitude in the choice of materials for coolant pipes and control mechanisms. Wigner now pressed ahead with his design for a water-cooled production reactor. There remained concerns about the ability of a graphite-moderated reactor being able to produce plutonium on industrial scale, and for this reason the Manhattan Project continued the development of heavy water production facilities. An air-cooled reactor, the X-10 Graphite Reactor, was built at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of a plutonium semiworks, followed by larger water-cooled production reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington state. Enough plutonium was produced for an atomic bomb by July 1945, and for two more in August.

A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical. It read as follows: The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957. The site of CP-1 was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 18 February 1965. When the National Register of Historic Places was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well. The site was also named a Chicago Landmark on 27 October 1971.
Today, the site of the old Stagg Field is occupied by the university&#x27;s Regenstein Library, which was opened in 1970, and the Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which was opened in 2011. A Henry Moore sculpture, &quot;Nuclear Energy&quot;, stands in a small quadrangle outside the Regenstein Library on the former site of the west viewing stands&#x27; rackets court. It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical. The commemorative plaques from 1952, 1965 and 1967 are nearby. A graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, New Mexico; another is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. On 2 December 2017, the 75th anniversary, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in restoring a research-graphite pile, similar in design to Chicago Pile-1, ceremonially inserted the final uranium slugs.

<text>The president of the Republic of Moldova () is the head of state of Moldova. The current president is Maia Sandu, who assumed office on 24 December 2020.

== Duties and functions ==
The president &quot;represents the State&quot; and is &quot;…the guarantor of national sovereignty and independence, as well as of the territorial unity and integrity of the State.&quot; In this capacity, the president ensures the continuity of the Moldovan state, arbitrates and mediates the regular functioning of public institutions, and upholds the rule of law. This role is in keeping with the president&#x27;s solemn oath, taken at inauguration, &quot;…to devote all my personal strength and abilities to the prosperity of the Republic of Moldova, to abide by the Constitution and the laws of the country, to defend democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms, the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Moldova.&quot;

Moldova is a parliamentary republic wherein most of the president&#x27;s powers are in practice ministerial, meaning they are exercised as stipulated by the Constitution, in accordance with the confidence of Parliament or, on the advice of the Government. The Moldovan presidency is thus a largely ceremonial institution. Nevertheless, because the president represents Moldova internationally, they have ultimate say over the country&#x27;s foreign policy. In addition, the president can influence domestic policy by using their status to initiate and participate in public discourse. Perhaps most importantly, the president enjoys a broad suite of discretionary powers which they may use to protect the established constitutional order.

===Ministerial powers===
The president, in order to maintain the continuity and stability of the democratic process, summons a new Parliament not later than 30 days following a general election and nominates a candidate for the office of prime minister after consulting the leaders of the different political parties in Parliament. If Parliament gives its vote of confidence to the nominee and to the nominee&#x27;s list of ministers, the president appoints the resulting prime minister-designate as prime minister and the other persons as ministers of the Government. Whenever the prime minister is incapacitated, including as a result of resignation or death in office, the president is likewise required to nominate another minister of the Government as acting prime minister. The acting prime minister is thereafter responsible for leading the Government until either a new prime minister is appointed or the incumbent prime minister&#x27;s incapacitation ceases.

Government formation aside, the president promulgates the laws passed by Parliament. Moreover, the president performs other functions in matters of foreign relations and national defence. As it concerns foreign relations, the president accredits and recalls Moldovan ambassadors and envoys stationed in foreign states, receives the credentials of foreign diplomats to Moldova, and authorizes the opening, closure, or change in rank of diplomatic missions operating abroad. As commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, the president may order general or partial mobilisations, repel armed aggression, declare a state of war, and take other due measures to safeguard public security and maintain public order. All of these functions are exercised on the advice of the Government and require for their validity the countersignature of the prime minister.

===Discretionary powers===
The president in their absolute discretion may:
#Convene extraordinary sessions of Parliament.
#Introduce legislation to Parliament.
#Attend plenary sessions of Parliament and otherwise address Parliament at any time on any matter of national interest.
#Dissolve Parliament and call snap elections.
#Negotiate and conclude treaties on behalf of the Republic of Moldova and submit them, in accordance with the manner and terms established under the law, to Parliament for its ratification.
#Award medals and titles of honour, supreme military ranks, and diplomatic ranks.
#Settle questions of citizenship and grant political asylum.
#Appoint public officers as provided by law.
#Grant individual pardons.
#Request Moldovan citizens express their will by way of referendum on matters of national interest.
#Confer superior degrees of qualification to officers holding positions with the prosecuting bodies, courts of law and to other categories of civil servants, under the law.
#Suspend Government ordinances and regulations which run contrary to primary legislation enacted by Parliament, unless and until the Constitutional Court rules on their legality.
#Submit any law of which the president objects to Parliament for its reconsideration within two weeks of the law&#x27;s passage. In the event Parliament abides by its previously passed decision, the president must promulgate the law.
#Appoints judges on the nomination of the Superior Council of Magistracy.
#Establish, organize, and appoint a Presidential Administration. The Presidential Administration is a collection of state agencies which reports to the president and serves as the president&#x27;s support staff. The secretary-general of the Presidential Administration serves as the liaison between the president and the Government and administers the various presidential agencies subject to the president&#x27;s direction and supervision. One such state agency, the Supreme Security Council, consults the president on foreign policy.
#Exercise other discretionary powers as may be provided by law.

==Election==
The president is elected in a two-round direct election, with a runoff taking place between the top two finishers if no candidate receives a majority in the first round. This system was put in place when the constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994.

In 2000, the Constitution was amended changing the process to an indirect election by the Parliament of Moldova, with a supermajority of 61 votes required. On March 4, 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional and Moldova consequently returned to electing the president via popular vote.

One presidential term lasts for four years; presidents are limited to two consecutive terms. Before the 2000 amendments, the presidential term lasted for five years.

<doc id="1118399" wikidata="Q662429" url="?curid=1118399" title="Pheasant pigeon">
<text>The pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) is a species of large terrestrial pigeon. It is the only species of the monotypic genus Otidiphaps. The pheasant pigeon is found in the primary rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands. It ranges primarily over hilly and lower mountain areas, but can also be found in lowlands.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus name makes reference to its similarities to the bustard family (Otidae). Its common name reflects its adaptation to living on the forest floor in the fashion of a South East Asian pheasant.

===Subspecies===
Commonly, there are four subspecies recognized that differ primarily in the presence or absence of a small crest and in the colour of the nape:

* White-naped pheasant pigeon (&quot;O. n. aruensis&quot;) – : Found on the Aru Islands, Vulnerable
* Green-naped pheasant pigeon (&quot;O. n. nobilis&quot;) – : Found on western New Guinea, Batanta and Waigeo Islands, Least concern.
* Grey-naped pheasant pigeon (&quot;O. n. cervicalis&quot;) – : Found on eastern and south-eastern New Guinea, Least concern.
* Black-naped pheasant pigeon (&quot;O. n. insularis&quot;) – : Found on Fergusson Island, Critically Endangered. 

Some authors, however, recognize the four subspecies as four different species, a classification scheme followed by the IUCN.

==Description==

The pheasant pigeon resembles a pheasant in external morphology, particularly in its laterally compressed tail and rounded wings. They have glossy black heads, undersides, rears and lower backs, and short rounded brown wings, and a white, green, grey, or black nape depending on the subspecies. No galliform birds occur in New Guinea, and the pheasant pigeon has filled the ecological niche of a partridge or small pheasant (while the larger &quot;Goura&quot; crowned pigeons have a lifestyle similar to larger pheasants, grouse or turkeys). It is a highly secretive species, feeding on seeds and fallen fruits. It inhabits hill and montane areas, however, it is also known to inhabit lower altitudes. It nests on the ground below trees and bushes, laying one egg that it incubates for around four weeks. Both adults incubate and look after the young, feeding regurgitated crop milk to their young (a common practice for most pigeons).

They have a range of calls including a drilling-like sound, a typical pigeon cooing call and a loud &quot;wu-huwoooooa&quot; call that rises and falls in pitch before trailing off at the end.

They are found in rainforest habitats, eating fallen fruits and seeds, in the Aru Islands. As they avoid human settlements, the little that is known about their behavior comes from observation at zoos.

==Status and conservation==
The species is believed to be slowly declining due to deforestation of their habitats from pressure for logging and agricultural space. Because it is tied to primary forests, and is unique within the pigeon family, it is considered a genus that requires further investigation and monitoring. The green-naped pheasant pigeon (nominate subspecies) and the grey-naped pheasant pigeon are not considered threatened, but the black-naped pheasant pigeon is considered critically endangered and the white-naped pheasant pigeon is vulnerable. The black-naped pheasant pigeon was for a long time known to science only from the type specimen collected in 1882, and for the ensuing 140 years thought to be extinct, but was then captured with a trail camera in late 2022 by researchers on Fergusson Island.

<text>USS &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; (AP-55/APA-25) was the lead ship of the &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot;-class attack transports and was in service with the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946. She was named for Founding Father Arthur Middleton and was scrapped in 1973.

==History==
&quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; was a transport launched as the commercial cargo/passenger ship &quot;African Comet&quot; serving in the United States Navy during World War II. The ship, along with later sister ships and , was at the time the largest all welded passenger/cargo ship. The ships, of and varying only in interior decorations, were designed for New York to South and East African service with accommodations for 116 passengers.

&quot;African Comet&quot;, ordered as &quot;American Banker&quot;, was laid down under a United States Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 106) on 1 July 1940 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. Launched on 28 June 1941, sponsored by Miss Mary Maud Farrell, and delivered 31 December 1941. The ship was acquired by the War Shipping Administration from the American South African Line, Inc., on 31 December 1941 and purchased by the Navy on 6 January 1942.

The ship was renamed &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; (AP-55) on 7 January 1942 for Arthur Middleton, a member of the Continental Congress and one of the 56 signers of the United States Declaration of Independence. The ship underwent initial conversion at Tietjen &amp; Lang Dry Dock Co. yard in Hoboken, N. J. for operation as a civilian-manned convoy-loaded transport. She was fully converted for service as a combat-loaded (attack) transport by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California after arrival in San Francisco from the South Pacific in June 1942. Commissioned on 7 September 1942.

After Navy acquisition and preliminary conversion, but before full conversion and commissioning, the &quot;Middleton&quot; was pressed into service during a shipping crisis involving securing the South Pacific lines of communication and critical air ferry route with Australia. New Caledonia (codename &quot;Poppy&quot;), a key point in those lines, had been in some turmoil with Vichy governance and recent takeover by Free French and was threatened by the Japanese. Another key island, Bora Bora (codename &quot;Bobcat&quot;), was also to be heavily reinforced in early 1942 yet available shipping was extremely short. Major realignment, taken to the head of state level, was required. The Bobcat convoy was to depart Charleston, South Carolina and, as a result of the candidate ship &quot;President Fillmore&quot; being damaged in a grounding with repairs taking longer than the convoy schedule allowed, the &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; was quickly substituted and sent to Charleston from New York, but without proper ballasting for newly installed armament.

&quot;Middleton&quot; turned out to be problematic with inadequate ballast for newly installed armament. She sailed for Charleston with a twelve degree list and then required work there. Work on &quot;Middleton&quot; and &quot;President Tyler&quot;, herself described as &quot;a mess,&quot; further delayed the convoy&#x27;s departure from 15 January, already a delay from 8 January, to 25 January. A large convoy carrying elements of &quot;Poppy Force&quot; was to leave New York and, to conserve escorts, the Navy recommended combining the Poppy convoy with the Bobcat convoy and the Army agreed. Just as the Poppy convoy was due off Charleston the Navy found it could not make &quot;Middleton&quot; and another ship, the &quot;Hamul&quot; ready for sea until 27 January when &quot;Middleton&quot; was again delayed until mid afternoon. &quot;Middleton&quot; sailed for Australia and then to Bora Bora in Convoy BC.100 arriving Bora Bora on 17 February. The delay with ships and some cargo required that the convoy BT.200 bound for New Caledonia via Australia, carrying Poppy Force (designated Task Force 6814) that became the Americal Division, sailed separately a few days in advance of the Bora Bora force.

After full conversion to an attack transport in San Francisco the ship was manned by a combined Coast Guard and Navy crew. The transport held shakedown training off San Diego, California and sailed for the Aleutian Islands on 23 December. She reached Amchitka on 12 January 1943 and, later that day, took on board 175 survivors from &quot;Worden&quot; (DD-352), which had run aground and broken up while covering the transport during the debarkation of her troops. However, before the day ended, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; herself ran aground after dragging anchor. Salvage operations involved completely unloading, blasting and removing the rocks from under the ship&#x27;s port side, and patching the holes which they had pierced in her hull. During this work, &quot;Arthur Middleton&#x27;s&quot; boats operated in Amchitak harbor unloading supply ships and moving Army barges. On eight occasions, the grounded ship repulsed enemy float-plane attacks and was straddled by four bombs.

While in Alaskan waters, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; was reclassified an attack transport and redesignated APA-25 on 1 February 1943. The ship was finally refloated and got underway on 9 April in tow of and for Dutch Harbor, Unalaska. There, work making temporary repairs continued through 17 June. She was then towed by the merchant ship and to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, for correction of the damage. &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; departed Seattle, Washington, on 6 September, bound for New Zealand. She arrived at Wellington on 12 October, via Suva, Fiji Islands. The ship took on marines and cargo and sailed to Efate, New Hebrides, for staging operations. She then steamed to the Gilbert Islands for the landings on Tarawa on 20 November. The ship remained off that bitterly contested atoll debarking troops and taking casualties on board until the 29th, when she got underway for Hawaii.

On 7 December, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; reached Pearl Harbor and began training operations. She sortied from Oahu on 23 January 1944 with Task Group (TG) 51.1, carrying marine reserves for the assault on the Marshall Islands. The transport remained in waters east of Kwajalein Atoll from 31 January through 15 February awaiting orders to disembark her troops; but, as part of the reserve force, they were not needed. During her time steaming off Kwajalein, she provided stores and fresh water to destroyers and smaller vessels, dispatched her boats on various assignments, and repaired damaged boats. She was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Parke Hughes who later became an eminent historian. On 15 February, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; sailed with the task group charged with invading Eniwetok.

Arriving off that atoll on the 17th, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; landed assault troops on Engebi Island and unloaded her cargo as needed by forces ashore. Two days later, she took marines on board for an assault on Parry Island. The landing there took place on the 21st and 22d and, the next day, the ship sailed for Pearl Harbor with American casualties and Japanese prisoners of war embarked. She paused en route at Kwajalein on the 26th to embark more troops and then resumed her voyage to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 March.

The attack transport held training exercises off Hawaii through late May. On the 30th, she sailed with TG 52.3 for the invasion of the Marianas. The ship arrived off Saipan on 15 June and debarked her passengers later that day at Charan Kanoa. She then began taking casualties on board while unloading her cargo. Although there were frequent air raid alerts during these operations, no Japanese planes came within range of the transport guns. She departed Saipan on 23 June, stopped at Eniwetok and Tarawa to pick up Army troops and Japanese prisoners, and continued on to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 9 July.

After disembarking her passengers, she began the first of two voyages between San Diego and Hilo, Hawaii, carrying troops and equipment between the two points. At the end of these shuttle runs, the transport sailed for the Admiralty Islands. She arrived at Manus on 3 October and began preparations for the long-awaited operations to liberate the Philippine Islands. On 14 October, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; sortied with TG 79.2 and arrived in Leyte Gulf on the 20th. The ship remained in the area unloading troops until 24 October, when she headed for Hollandia, New Guinea.

The attack transport returned to Leyte on 14 November, carrying personnel and supplies from Hollandia and Morotai, Netherlands East Indies. The next day, she sailed back to New Guinea and conducted training exercises in conjunction with Marine Corps units. On 31 December, the ship sailed with TG 79.4 for the invasion of Luzon and arrived in the transport area in Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 and landed her troops in the face of enemy air attack. During the operation, fifteen members of her crew were wounded by flying shrapnel from the guns of other vessels firing at the Japanese planes. The transport left Lingayen Gulf later that day to take on more supplies at Leyte and returned to Lingayen Gulf on 27 January.

During February and early March, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; carried out training exercises at Guadalcanal. On 16 March, the transport sailed with TG 53.1 for Ulithi, where staging operations were held for the Ryūkyū campaign. The ship discharged troops and cargo at Okinawa during the first five days of April and then returned via Saipan to Pearl Harbor. She was routed on to the west coast and arrived at San Pedro, Calif., on 30 April to begin a period of overhaul.

While the ship was still in the yard, Japan surrendered on 14 August 1945. The repair work was completed on 4 September, and &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; was assigned to duty transporting relief forces to the Philippines and returning veterans to the United States. By the end of 1945, the ship had made two voyages to the Philippines. In January 1946, she underwent repairs at Terminal Island, California. Following the detachment of her Coast Guard personnel, &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; was transferred to the Naval Transportation Service on 1 February 1946.

During the next four months, the transport made six round trips between San Francisco and Pearl Harbor. She then steamed through the Panama Canal and continued on to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 19 July 1946. The ship was placed out of commission at Norfolk on 21 October 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. At the end of a dozen years in reserve, her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1958; and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the James River. She was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet on 3 March 1959. The vessel was sold for $96,666 on 9 May 1973 to the Consolidated Steel Corporation, Brownsville, Texas, and was later scrapped.

&quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; won six battle stars for her World War II service.

There was another ship with the name &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot;, a Liberty (EC2-S-C1) launched and delivered May–June 1942, operating at the same time as the USS &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot; until sunk by an explosion off Oran, North Africa 1 January 1943. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named &quot;Arthur Middleton&quot;.

<text>VTech Holdings Limited (an abbreviation of Video Technology Limited or simply VTech) is a Hong Kong company of children&#x27;s electronic learning products. It is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of baby monitors and cordless phones. It was founded in October 1976 by Allan Wong (Chi-Yun) and Stephen Leung.

==Name and listing==
The company was originally named &quot;Video Technology Limited&quot; in reference to the company&#x27;s first product, a home video game console. In 1991, it was renamed &quot;VTech Holdings Limited&quot; to reflect a wider portfolio of products.

The company was first listed in Hong Kong in June 1986 under the name &quot;Video Technology International (Holdings) Limited&quot;. It was privatised and delisted from The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1990.

VTech obtained a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. In 1992, the company relisted on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, establishing a dual primary listing with London. In 1993, the company established its American depositary receipt programme.

VTech was delisted voluntarily from the London Stock Exchange on 7 October 2008. It also terminated its American Depositary Receipt programme with effect from 21 January 2011.

==History==

VTech was founded in Hong Kong in October 1976 by two local entrepreneurs, Allan Wong (Chi-Yun) and Stephen Leung. When the first single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004, became available in the early 1970s, the company saw the potential it offered for portable consumer electronics products. Wong &amp; Leung set up a small factory in To Kwa Wan, with a investment and a staff of 40 people. In the first year, turnover was less than $1 million.

VTech initially focused on developing video games. In 1977, the company created its first home TV game console, a version of Pong. Since only consumers in North America and Europe could afford such items, the company targeted primarily these markets.

The United Kingdom was chosen as the first market for Pong, as Hong Kong and the UK used the same standard for television systems. In 1978, the founders introduced LED games they had developed to buyers from RadioShack in the US, which were sold under the RadioShack brand.

VTech then began to build its own brand. Starting in the early 1980s, a line of electronic games would be manufactured. VTech unveiled its first electronic learning product, called Lesson One, at the New York Toy Fair, in February 1980. It taught children basic spelling and maths. An exclusive version under the name Computron was offered to Sears, with the product being prominently advertised by Sears, in its catalogue, which was a popular shopping guide.

Next, VTech made the video game console CreatiVision. An electronic product with an external projector from French company Ludotronic was adapted by VTech and sold as the VTech ProScreen in 1984, following the release of VTech&#x27;s Gamate and Variety handheld products the year prior.

VTech then branched out into personal computers, including a series of 8-bit TRS-80 competition computers named the Laser 200, 210, and 310, as well as a series of IBM PC compatibles both beginning in 1983, followed by Apple II compatible computers, beginning in 1985, including a model called Laser 128. After acquiring PC manufacturer Leading Technology of Oregon in 1992, VTech exited the personal computer market in 1997 due to tight competition.

In 1985, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated the frequency band 900 MHz to ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) devices. Taking advantage of this, VTech began development on a cordless telephone, using the 900 MHz band, and in 1991 introduced the world&#x27;s first fully digital 900 MHz cordless telephone.

In 2000, to expand its cordless phone business, VTech acquired the consumer telephone business of Lucent Technologies. The acquisition also gave VTech the exclusive right for 10 years to use the AT&amp;T brand in conjunction with the manufacture and sale of wireline telephones and accessories in the United States and Canada. Although the acquisition increased sales of VTech&#x27;s telecommunication products by 50%, it led to operating losses and write-offs. The company issued a profit warning in March 2001 and launched a broad restructuring plan. By the financial year 2002, the company had turned around the business and returned to profitability.

Today, VTech&#x27;s core businesses remain cordless telephones and electronic learning products. Its contract manufacturing services – which manufactures various electronic products on behalf of medium-sized companies, have also become a major source of revenue. The company has diversified geographically, selling to North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.

==Core businesses==
===Electronic learning products (ELPs)===
VTech was among the pioneers of the ELP industry, beginning in 1980 with a unit designed to teach children basic spelling and mathematics.

Today VTech makes both individual standalone products and platform products that combine a variety of consoles with different software.

Its V.Smile TV Learning System, which was launched in 2004, established what the company calls platform products as an important category within its ELPs. Latest additions to the platform product range are MobiGo, InnoTab Max, Kidizoom Smart Watch and InnoTV (StorioTV in Europe Excluding United Kingdom).

===Telecommunication (TEL) products===

VTech introduced the world&#x27;s first 900 MHz and 5.8 GHz cordless phones in 1991 and 2002 respectively. As of 2014, the company was the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of cordless telephones, according to MZA (as reported by VTech).

As of 2014, VTech, in its sale of both AT&amp;T and VTech branded phones and accessories, was the largest player in the industry , in North America, according to MarketWise Consumer Insights (as reported by VTech). Outside North America, as of this date, VTech mainly supplied products to fixed-line telephone operators, brand names, and distributors on an ODM basis.
===Contract manufacturing services (CMS)===
VTech started manufacturing products for other brand names on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis in the 1980s and CMS became one of the company&#x27;s core businesses in the early 2000s.

VTech has been identified as one of the world&#x27;s top 50 electronics manufacturing services providers, providing electronics manufacturing services for medium-sized companies. VTech&#x27;s CMS has focused on four main product categories: professional audio equipment, switching mode power supplies, wireless products, and solid-state lighting.

==Controversies==

=== 2012 working conditions controversy ===
A June 2012 report from the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights said the working conditions in the VTech factories in China failed to meet the legal standards and could be described as sweatshops. VTech strongly rejected the allegations in a statement issued on 22 June 2012.
=== 2015 data breach ===

In November 2015, Lorenzo Bicchierai, writing for &quot;Vice&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Motherboard&quot;, reported that VTech&#x27;s servers had been compromised and the corporation was victim to a data breach which exposed personal data belonging to 6.3 million individuals, including children, who signed up for or utilized services provided by the company related to several products it manufactures. Bicchierai was contacted by the unnamed attacker in late November, during the week before Thanksgiving, at which point the unnamed individual disclosed information about the security vulnerabilities with the journalist and detailed the breach.

Bicchierai then reached out to information security researcher Troy Hunt to examine data provided by the attacker to Bicchierai, and to confirm if the leak was indeed authentic and not an internet hoax. Hunt examined the information and confirmed it appeared to be authentic. Hunt then dissected the data in detail and published the findings on his website. According to Hunt, VTech&#x27;s servers failed to utilize basic SSL encryption to secure the personal data in transit from the devices to VTech&#x27;s servers; that VTech stored customer information in unencrypted plaintext, failed to securely hash or salt passwords.

The attack leveraged an SQL injection to gain privileged root access to VTech servers. Once privileged access was acquired, the attacker exfiltrated the data, including some 190 gigabytes of photographs of children and adults, detailed chat logs between parents and children which spanned over the course of years, and voice recordings, all unencrypted and stored in plain text. The attacker shared some 3,832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes, and some redacted photographs were published by the journalist. Commenting on the leak, the unidentified hacker
expressed their disgust with being able to so easily obtain access to such a large trove of data, saying: &quot;Frankly, it makes me sick that I was able to get all this stuff. VTech should have the book thrown at them&quot; and explained their rationale for going to the press was because they felt VTech would have ignored their reports and concerns.

VTech corporate security was unaware their systems had been compromised and the breach was first brought to their attention after being contacted by Bicchierai prior to the publication of the article. Upon notification, the company took a dozen or so websites and services offline.

In an FAQ published by the company, they explain some 4,854,209 accounts belonging to parents and 6,368,509 profiles belonging to children had been compromised. The company further claims the passwords had been encrypted, which is contrary to reports by the independent security researcher contacted by &quot;Vice&quot;. The company indicated they were working with unspecified &quot;local authorities&quot;. VTech subsequently brought in the information security services company FireEye to manage incident response and audit the security of their platform going forward.

Mark Nunnikhoven of Trend Micro criticized the company&#x27;s handling of the incident and called their FAQ &quot;wishy-washy corporate speak&quot;.

U.S. Senator Edward Markey and Representative Joe Barton, co-founders of the Bi-Partisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, issued an open letter to the company inquiring as to why and what kind of information belonging to children is stored by VTech and how they use this data, security practices employed to protect that data if children&#x27;s information is shared or sold to third parties and how the company complies with the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act.

In February 2016, Hunt publicized the fact that VTech had modified its Terms and Conditions for new customers so that the customer acknowledges and agrees that any information transmitted to VTech may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorized parties.

In January 2018, the US Federal Trade Commission fined VTech $650,000 for the breach, around $0.09 per victim.

<text>James J. Hughes (born May 27, 1961) is an American sociologist, bioethicist and futurist. He is the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and is the Associate Provost for institutional research, assessment, and planning at University of Massachusetts Boston. He is the author of &quot;Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future&quot; and is currently writing a book on secular Buddhism and moral bioenhancement tentatively titled &quot;Cyborg Buddha: Using Neurotechnology to Become Better People&quot;.

==Biography==
Hughes holds a doctorate in sociology from the University of Chicago, where he served as the assistant director of research for the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Before graduate school he was temporarily ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1984 while working as a volunteer in Sri Lanka for the development organization Sarvodaya from 1983 to 1985.

Hughes served as executive director of the World Transhumanist Association from 2004 to 2006 and currently serves as executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, which he founded with Nick Bostrom. He also produced the syndicated weekly public affairs radio talk show program &quot;Changesurfer Radio&quot; and contributed to the &quot;Cyborg Democracy&quot; blog. Hughes&#x27; book &quot;Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future&quot; was published by Westview Press in November 2004.

Before working at UMass Boston, he lectured at Northwestern University, the University of Connecticut, and Trinity College.

Rejecting bioconservatism and libertarian transhumanism, Hughes argues for democratic transhumanism, a radical form of techno-progressivism that asserts that the best possible &quot;posthuman future&quot; is achievable only by ensuring that human enhancement technologies are safe, made available to everyone, and respect the right of individuals to control their own bodies.

Hughes sits on the academic advisory council of the Christian Transhumanist Association.

<doc id="1118423" wikidata="Q1750565" url="?curid=1118423" title="Willamette Week">
<text>Willamette Week (WW) is an alternative weekly newspaper and a website published in Portland, Oregon, United States, since 1974. It features reports on local news, politics, sports, business, and culture.

==History==

===Early history===
&quot;Willamette Week&quot; was founded in 1974 by Ronald A. Buel, who served as its first publisher. It was later owned by the Eugene &quot;Register-Guard&quot;, which sold it in the fall of 1983 to Richard H. Meeker and Mark Zusman, who took the positions of publisher and editor, respectively. Meeker had been one of the paper&#x27;s first reporters, starting in 1974, and Zusman had joined the paper as a business writer in 1982. Meeker and Zusman formed City of Roses Newspaper Company to publish &quot;WW&quot; and a sister publication, &quot;Fresh Weekly&quot;, a free guide to local arts and entertainment. &quot;WW&quot; had a paid circulation at that time, with about 12,000 subscribers.

===Post-merger===
A major change was made in January 1984, when &quot;Fresh Weekly&quot; was merged into &quot;WW&quot;, the paper&#x27;s print run was increased to 50,000 and paid circulation was discontinued, with &quot;WW&quot; thereafter being distributed free. WW increased circulation to 90,000 copies by 2007. Circulation has declined to 50,000 by March 2020.

In June 2015, Richard Meeker stepped down as &quot;Willamette Week&quot;″s publisher, after more than 31 years in the position. Editor Mark Zusman succeeded him as publisher, while also retaining the editorship. Meeker planned to continue working for the City of Roses Newspaper Company, WW&#x27;s owner.

==Features==

Prior to his death in 2010, cartoonist John Callahan&#x27;s long-running comic &quot;Callahan&quot; appeared weekly in the paper, for almost 30 years.

==Finances==
Since 1984, the paper has been free; as of 2007 over 80% of its revenue was generated through display advertising. For 2007, its revenue was expected to be about $6.25 million, a four or five percent increase over 2006, a growth that occurred in spite of a significant decline in classified advertising that the publisher attributed to competition from Craigslist. Its pre-tax profit in 2006 was around 5%, a third to a half of what large mass-media companies require.

==Notable stories==
Notable stories first reported by &quot;WW&quot; include:

* In 2004, making public Neil Goldschmidt&#x27;s long-concealed sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl. Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor, was mayor of Portland at the time of the abuse. After &quot;Willamette Week&quot; contacted him for comments regarding its upcoming story about that alleged misconduct, Goldschmidt went ahead and confessed to the relationship in an interview published in &quot;The Oregonian.&quot; That interview ran prior to &quot;Willamette Week&quot;″s report appearing in print, and was intended to preempt the story&#x27;s publication. However, the alternative weekly did finally get the scoop, breaking the Goldschmidt story first on its website. Nigel Jaquiss won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for his work on that story.
*In 2008, &quot;Willamette Week&quot;&#x27;s Beth Slovic drew a conclusion that former senator Gordon Smith employed undocumented workers at his frozen-foods processing operation in Eastern Oregon while acknowledging that she has no definitive proof.
* In 2009, reporting that then-City Commissioner Sam Adams engaged in a sexual relationship with a legislative intern, Beau Breedlove. Rumors of a relationship between the two men had circulated during Adams&#x27; campaign for mayor, but Adams denied any sexual relationship. Only after &quot;Willamette Week&quot; contacted Adams for comment on an upcoming story did he admit publicly that there had been a sexual relationship. However, he stipulated that there had been no relationship between them until after Breedlove turned 18. Adams said he&#x27;d previously lied about the relationship in order to avoid feeding negative stereotypes of gay men as somehow predatory.
*In 2015, then-Governor John Kitzhaber&#x27;s fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, confirmed &quot;Willamette Week&quot;″s report that she married an 18-year-old Ethiopian immigrant in 1997 in exchange for a $5,000 payment so that he could keep his residency to attend school in United States.

<doc id="1118424" wikidata="Q1993564" url="?curid=1118424" title="Keiji Nishitani">
<text>was a Japanese philosopher. He was a scholar of the Kyoto School and a disciple of Kitarō Nishida. In 1924, Nishitani received his doctorate from Kyoto Imperial University for his dissertation &quot;Das Ideale und das Reale bei Schelling und Bergson&quot;. He studied under Martin Heidegger in Freiburg from 1937 to 1939.

==Career==
Nishitani held the principal Chair of Philosophy and Religion at Kyoto University from 1943 until becoming emeritus in 1964. He then taught philosophy and religion at Ōtani University. At various times Nishitani was a visiting professor in the United States and Europe.

According to James Heisig, after being banned from holding any public position by the United States Occupation authorities in July 1946, Nishitani refrained from drawing &quot;practical social conscience into philosophical and religious ideas, preferring to think about the insight of the individual rather than the reform of the social order.&quot;

In James Heisig&#x27;s &quot;Philosophers of Nothingness&quot; Nishitani is quoted as saying &quot;The fundamental problem of my life … has always been, to put it simply, the overcoming of nihilism &quot;through&quot; nihilism.&quot;

== Thought ==
On Heisig&#x27;s reading, Nishitani&#x27;s philosophy had a distinctive religious and subjective bent, drawing Nishitani close to existentialists and mystics, most notably Søren Kierkegaard and Meister Eckhart, rather than to the scholars and theologians who aimed at systematic elaborations of thought. Heisig further argues that Nishitani, &quot;the stylistic superior of Nishida,&quot; brought Zen poetry, religion, literature, and philosophy organically together in his work to help lay the difficult foundations for a breaking free of the Japanese language, in a similar way to Blaise Pascal or Friedrich Nietzsche. Heisig argues that, unlike Nishida who had supposedly focused on building a philosophical system and who towards the end of his career began to focus on political philosophy, Nishitani focused on delineating a standpoint &quot;from which he could enlighten a broader range of topics,&quot; and wrote more on Buddhist themes towards the end of his career.

In works such as &quot;Religion and Nothingness&quot;, Nishitani focuses on the Buddhist term Śūnyatā (emptiness/nothingness) and its relation to Western nihilism. To contrast with the Western idea of nihility as the absence of meaning Nishitani&#x27;s Śūnyatā relates to the acceptance of &quot;anatta&quot;, one of the three Right Understandings in the Noble Eightfold Path and the rejection of the ego in order to recognize the Pratītyasamutpāda, to be one with everything. Stating: &quot;All things that are in the world are linked together, one way or the other. Not a single thing comes into being without some relationship to every other thing.&quot; However, Nishitani always wrote and understood himself as a &quot;philosopher&quot; akin in spirit to Nishida insofar as the teacher—always bent upon fundamental problems of ordinary life—sought to revive a path of life walked already by ancient predecessors, most notably in the Zen tradition. Nor can Heisig&#x27;s reading of Nishitani as &quot;existentialist&quot; convince in the face of Nishitani&#x27;s critique of existentialism—a critique that walked, in its essential orientation, in the footsteps of Nishida&#x27;s &quot;Investigation of the Good&quot; (Zen no Kenkyū).

Among the many works authored by Nishitani in Japanese, are the following titles: &quot;Divinity and Absolute Negation&quot; (Kami to zettai Mu; 1948), &quot;Examining Aristotle&quot; (Arisutoteresu ronkō; 1948); &quot;Religion, Politics, and Culture&quot; (Shūkyō to seiji to bunka; 1949); &quot;Modern Society&#x27;s Various Problems and Religion&quot; (Gendai shakai no shomondai to shūkyō; 1951); &quot;Regarding Buddhism&quot; (Bukkyō ni tsuite; 1982); &quot;Nishida Kitaro: The Man and the Thought&quot; (Nishida Kitarō, sono hito to shisō; 1985); &quot;The Standpoint of Zen&quot; (Zen no tachiba; 1986); &quot;Between Religion and Non-Religion&quot; (Shūkyō to hishūkyō no aida; 1996). His written works have been edited into a 26-volume collection &quot;Nishitani Keiji Chosakushū&quot; (1986-1995). A more exhaustive list of works is accessible on the Japanese version of the present wikipage.

<text>Jaguar Racing is the name given to Jaguar Land Rover&#x27;s racing interests. The Jaguar brand currently competes in Formula E under the name Jaguar [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]] Racing for sponsorship reasons. It is the defending Formula E World Teams&#x27; Champion, having won the 2023–24 title. 

From to , Jaguar competed in Formula One. Its best finish was in the Constructors&#x27; Championship was 7th, which it achieved three times, from 2002 to 2004. The team was subsequently sold to Red Bull, which renamed the team to Red Bull Racing.

The Jaguar brand also has rich history in various forms of sportscar racing, most notably with the XJR sportscars in the FIA World Sportscar Championship and IMSA GT Championship during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Formula E==
In December 2015, Jaguar announced that it would start a Formula E team, building its own chassis and powertrain. Panasonic agreed to become the team&#x27;s lead sponsor, with secondary sponsorship from Lear Corporation. The team also signed Gorillaz guitarist Noodle as a team ambassador, and launched a commercial in which Noodle drives an electric open-wheeled car before getting out and saying the experience could be improved.

===2016–17 season===

Jaguar made their debut in the 2016–17 season, replacing the folded Trulli GP. The team signed A1 GP champion Adam Carroll and 2012 GP3 champions Mitch Evans as its drivers. Jaguar finished 10th in the Teams&#x27; Championship, with the best result being a double points finish of 4th and 8th at the 2017 Mexico City ePrix. Carroll along with Andretti&#x27;s Robin Frijns were the only two drivers to finish all 12 races of the season.

===2017–18 season===

Prior to the season, Jaguar entered a multi-year partnership with GKN. A new sponsorship deal with Viessmann was also announced. In an effort to boost its chances at good results, Jaguar signed Nelson Piquet Jr., the series&#x27; inaugural Drivers&#x27; Champion. Piquet had the option to stay with his previous employer NIO, but chose not to as a performance clause allowed him to exit the team. Evans was retained to partner Piquet, who replaced Carroll. Ho-Pin Tung remained with the team for another season as a reserve driver. At the season&#x27;s first event in Hong Kong, Jaguar scored points in both of the weekend&#x27;s races and took their first podium in the series when Mitch Evans was moved up to third following a post race disqualification of Daniel Abt. The team used Paul di Resta and Pietro Fittipaldi for a rookie test held in Marrakesh which followed the 2018 Marrakesh ePrix. At the Zürich ePrix, Evans claimed the team&#x27;s maiden pole position.

Jaguar would finish 6th in Teams&#x27; Championship, with the best result being Evans&#x27; inherited third place in the second race of the 2017 Hong Kong ePrix. The team managed three double points finishes throughout the season. Both drivers finished in top 10 of the Drivers&#x27; Championship – Evans was seventh, while Piquet ended the season at ninth place. Piquet, however, also had the most retirements out of all drivers who competed in the season – he missed the chequered flag five times.

===2018–19 season===

Evans and Piquet were retained for the 2018–19 season. Ho-Pin Tung was also retained in his position. In addition to his reserve driver duty, Tung also served as a pundit and was part of the Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy broadcast team. For the 2019 rookie test (which was once again held in Marrakesh following the ePrix), the team opted to bring back Pietro Fittipaldi and pair him with Harry Tincknell. In March 2019, just after the inaugural Sanya ePrix, Piquet left the team following a string of poor results (in contrast to Evans&#x27; string of points finishes) and was replaced by former Virgin driver Alex Lynn. Evans managed to win the following race in Rome, giving Jaguar their first win – this was also the team&#x27;s first actual podium finish in the series. His teammate Lynn finished 12th on his Jaguar debut. Evans&#x27; car was subsequently sent to the FIA headquarters in Geneva for checks to analyse one of the wishbones and its compliance with the wishbone/arm element sealed at the homologation. No issues were found, thus the win became officially confirmed.

Evans&#x27; point-scoring streak came to an end in a rain-soaked Paris ePrix, where he was the last driver to physically cross the finish line in sixteenth place, being a lap down after an unscheduled pit stop for a new nose. Lynn was forced to retire from a promising eleventh place after an accident with Venturi&#x27;s Edoardo Mortara, effectively ending Jaguar&#x27;s chances to score points in this round. As a result, this was the first race of the season where both cars failed to score points. The following race in Monaco was a success, with both cars finishing on points for the first time since the opening round in Ad Diriyah. The race also marked Lynn&#x27;s first point-scoring finish for the team. The team had a strong finish to the season, with Evans picking up multiple podium finishes, which even inserted him into Drivers&#x27; Championship fight at the Swiss ePrix, after which he found himself third in the ongoing championship with 87 points. Lynn was mostly dealing with reliability issues, most notably retiring from second place in the first New York City race at the Brooklyn Street Circuit.

Despite improved form in the second half of the season, Jaguar would finish 7th in Teams&#x27; Championship with 116 points, which is down from a 6th place achieved in the previous season. Evans, however, improved his result in Drivers&#x27; Championship as he finished fifth with 105 points, only three points short from Lucas di Grassi, who finished third. Evans was also the only driver who managed to physically cross the finish line in every race of the season, even though Audi&#x27;s Daniel Abt was classified in every race as well (but failed to finish in Rome as he retired in the final lap).

===2019–20 season===

In June 2019, Jaguar began their season six development testings with Alex Lynn and Mitch Evans. The team also tested James Calado, a potential candidate for the second seat. On 26 September, Jaguar formally confirmed Evans as their first driver as he signed a multi-year contract with the team. This will be Evans&#x27; fourth consecutive season with Jaguar. On 2 October, Calado was confirmed as Evans&#x27; teammate. On the same day, Jaguar also unveiled the new &quot;I-Type 4&quot; along with Castrol as its new partner, which returns to Jaguar&#x27;s motorsport activities after a near 30-year absence. On 7 January 2020, it was announced that Alex Lynn was brought back to the team to become a reserve and test driver. With this move, Ho-Pin Tung, Jaguar&#x27;s previous reserve driver, became the Jaguar Racing Global Ambassador while also remaining in the I-Pace eTrophy commentary team.

At the Mexico City ePrix, Evans gave Jaguar their second Formula E win while also picking up a second consecutive bonus point for being the fastest driver in group qualifying stage. Calado finished ninth, but was later disqualified for a technical infringement. On 19 February, Jaguar announced Jamie Chadwick as the first of the two selected drivers for the third annual Marrakesh rookie test. On the following day, Sacha Fenestraz was announced to join Chadwick for the rookie test. On 30 July, Jaguar announced Tom Blomqvist as its new reserve driver, after Lynn got signed to Mahindra Racing and leaving Jaguar in the process. Calado&#x27;s final race for Jaguar would be the fourth Berlin race as 2020 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps prevented him from attending the final two races, in which the new reserve Blomqvist would take his place.

After an unsuccessful season finale in Berlin, Jaguar would only score 81 points in their campaign, finishing 7th in Teams&#x27; Championship once again.

===2020–21 season===
On 14 July 2020, Jaguar became the first team to announce its driver lineup for the 2020–21 season after signing Sam Bird to the team. Bird would finish the ongoing 2019–20 season with Envision Virgin Racing before completing the switch. Evans continues with the team as he signed a multi-year contract prior to the 2019–20 season. In October 2020, Jaguar unveiled the development version of the &quot;I-Type 5&quot; car, with the team only referencing to itself as Jaguar Racing, quietly splitting with the title sponsor Panasonic. On 27 November, the team held a virtual launch of the &quot;I-Type 5&quot; along with the drivers presentation, revealing new sponsors and announcing the car numbers. In February 2021, Sacha Fenestraz returned to the team as a reserve driver, replacing Blomqvist who joined NIO 333 as a full-time driver.

The Diriyah ePrix double-header saw the team scoring two podium finishes and two retirements. In the first race, Evans finished third after successfully defending his position over René Rast. Bird retired from the race following a collision with Alex Lynn, who was later given a penalty for the incident. In the following race, Bird won his first race in the Jaguar overalls after starting from third and successfully overtaking Dragon&#x27;s Sérgio Sette Câmara at the start and later the pole-sitter Robin Frijns, his former Virgin Racing teammate. The race however ended prematurely red-flagged due to Alex Lynn being involved in a huge collision with Evans, who retired in the process. He tried to check on Lynn, who was later taken to hospital. After this race, Jaguar moved to the lead in Teams&#x27; Championship for the very first time. At the Valencia ePrix double-header, the team lost its lead in Teams&#x27; Championship as it failed to score a single point after poor qualifying performances in both races due to wet conditions in their qualifying group.

In May 2021, Tom Dillmann joined the team as a second reserve driver, returning to the sport after previously competing for Venturi and NIO. On 22 July 2021, Jaguar Land Rover formally committed to Formula E for the next set of rules which are set to keep Jaguar Racing on the grid until 2026. Then on 3 August, it was announced that Evans signed another multi-year extension with the team. Before the Berlin ePrix, it was announced that Gerd Mäuser would step down from his role as a chairman after the season with Thierry Bolloré succeeding him in the role. In their most successful season to date, Jaguar Racing finished second in Teams&#x27; Championship with 177 points, having led it on two separate occasions (the second one being before the final round), with two victories scored by Bird and further six podium finishes, five of which scored by Evans who as a result scored the most podium finishes out of anyone that season.

===2021–22 season===
On 2 November 2021, the team announced their latest rebranding to Jaguar TCS Racing along with confirming the unchanged driver lineup of Bird and Evans. Thierry Bolloré was also confirmed as the team&#x27;s new chairman. On 17 January 2022, Norman Nato was announced as Jaguar&#x27;s new reserve and simulator driver, joining Tom Dillmann and replacing Sacha Fenestraz. On 8 February 2022, it was announced that Jaguar would become powertrain suppliers for Envision Racing over the duration of the Gen3 era of Formula E which is set to start with the 2022–23 season.

After a poor start to the season, Jaguar recovered at the Rome ePrix where Evans got a double victory. Bird was also looking for a double points finish, but he was forced to retire from the second race. At the inaugural Jakarta ePrix, Evans added another win to his resume, remaining fourth in the championship, but getting closer to his title rivals that gained advantage on him after a less successful Berlin ePrix double-header.

Bolloré stepped down as Jaguar Land Rover CEO in November 2022. With no direct replacement announced for Jaguar Racing&#x27;s chairman position, Barclay would now remain the sole official authority in the team heading into the Gen3 era of Formula E.

===2022–23 season===

Jaguar retained Evans and Bird for their Gen3 debut. The team changed its visual presentation, ditching teal in favor of white, while keeping black as primary colour. Also part of this change, the new &quot;I-Type 6&quot; cars would also run asymmetric liveries. Jaguar had a troublesome season opener in Mexico City. Bird was suffering from technical issues throughout the whole weekend and had to retire early into the race. Evans, despite crashing after the first free practice due to a different unspecified problem, finished the race in eighth position. Further drama came at the inaugural Hyderabad ePrix, where Bird collided with Evans after unsuccessfully attempting an overtake on Sacha Fenestraz, taking both him and Evans out of the race.

Jaguar-powered cars were initially uncompetitive against Porsche-powered teams in race conditions (despite having a superior one-lap pace), but slowly took over, scoring several poles, podium finishes and wins since, splitting them between the factory drivers of Evans and Bird and the customer Envision Racing driver lineup of Nick Cassidy and Sébastien Buemi, who became Jaguar&#x27;s biggest title rivals in the process. Jaguar lost the teams&#x27; title by 12 points to Envision; Evans secured the third in the drivers&#x27; championship.

===2023–24 season===
On 12 January 2024, it was announced that Joel Eriksson and Tom Dillmann would both remain as test, reserve, and simulator drivers for the 2023–24 season. Meanwhile, Nick Cassidy would replace Bird to partner Evans. The team experienced their best season to date, as two wins from each of their drivers would put them on the brink of winning all three titles come the final round in London. Whilst their results would be enough to win both the teams&#x27; championship and, along with customer team Envision, the newly-formed manufacturers&#x27; trophy, a puncture for Cassidy and a late attack mode miss from Evans meant that Jaguar missed out on the drivers&#x27; title to Pascal Wehrlein, with Evans and Cassidy ending up second and third respectively.

==Formula One==
=== Overview ===
In June 1999, Jaguar&#x27;s then-parent company, American automaker Ford, purchased Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Stewart Grand Prix Formula One team for a price variously reported at £65 or £100 million. Ford was already a minority investor in the Stewart outfit and supplied the team with engines through its then-subsidiary Cosworth. It renamed the team to Jaguar in September 1999. Ford announced a $400 million project to build a unified facility in Silverstone for its engine and constructor operations, but these plans never came to fruition, and Jaguar remained in Milton Keynes.

The team operated for five seasons, from to . During this period, &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that Ford spent £500 million on the team and incurred significant operating losses. Due to Jaguar&#x27;s combination of works-team backing and limited success, it was deemed a major flop. Looking back in 2023, &quot;Motor Sport&quot; wrote that Jaguar was &quot;one of the most high-profile failures in F1,&quot; with &quot;a revolving door of management that made Jaguar Racing look like an employment bureau rather than a slick F1 team.&quot;

At the end of the 2004 season, Ford sold the team to Red Bull for £1. The Austrian company concurrently pledged to invest at least £200 million in the team over three years. Ford also sold Cosworth to the owners of Champ Car, thus effecting its complete operational withdrawal from F1 after 35 years as a competitor and/or engine supplier. Elements within the Ford organisation made a last-ditch attempt to save the team by rebranding it from Jaguar to Ford, but company leadership in Detroit went ahead with the sale; it was estimated that Ford was losing $50 million/year on F1. Formula One Group CEO Bernie Ecclestone regretted the loss but emphasized that Jaguar as a whole was in poor shape, explaining that with the parent company &quot;closing a factory ... it would have been a bit cheeky to keep the Formula One factory going in those circumstances.&quot; 

===2000 season===
For , Jaguar retained Stewart driver Johnny Herbert and partnered him with 1999 world championship runner-up Eddie Irvine, who reportedly received a $15m contract. However, the team fell short of Stewart&#x27;s 1999 results, finishing ninth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Irvine scoring all four of the team&#x27;s points. The only teams Jaguar beat were Minardi and Prost, which both failed to score any points. The highlight of the year was Irvine&#x27;s fourth-place finish at Monaco.

Jaguar&#x27;s rookie year introduced a common theme: the struggle for control between Ford headquarters in Detroit and Jaguar Racing&#x27;s headquarters in Milton Keynes. The team was overseen by Wolfgang Reitzle, the head of Ford&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group, whose remit included both Jaguar Racing and Ford&#x27;s various luxury marques. Although Jackie Stewart initially stayed on as chairman and CEO, he stepped down in January 2000. Neil Ressler, Ford&#x27;s chief technical officer, was appointed chairman and interim CEO in January, and became full-time CEO in May. Paul Stewart remained as COO but stepped down in the middle of the season due to colon cancer.

Ressler planned to fill the CEO role until Ford procured the services of Ferrari&#x27;s Ross Brawn, a veteran of Jaguar&#x27;s title-winning sports car operation, but this did not happen. In the meantime, he clashed with some of Jaguar&#x27;s UK-based personnel. It was reported that during the , Ressler nearly came to blows with technical director Gary Anderson, a holdover from Stewart GP who resented the Ford bureaucracy&#x27;s intrusion on his turf. Anderson also complained that the England-based team was forced to use a wind tunnel in California (albeit the same wind tunnel that Stewart had previously used) and that Cosworth got more attention than Jaguar from Ford leadership in Detroit.

===2001 season===

For , Jaguar retained Irvine and replaced Herbert with Luciano Burti, who was himself replaced by Pedro de la Rosa after four races. Irvine scored the team&#x27;s first podium in Monaco, finishing third. This allowed Jaguar to finish eighth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with nine points, including four points-scoring performances.

The year was marked by continued management turmoil. In September 2000, Ressler appointed three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal as team principal for 2001. Ressler then stepped down as CEO before the season began. As part of a broader management shakeup, Ford created a &quot;Ford Premier Performance Division&quot; to oversee Jaguar and its other racing operations. Reitzle was named chairman and three-time Drivers&#x27; Champion Niki Lauda was named CEO, with a reported salary of $3 million/year. However, following financial turmoil at Jaguar, Ford redirected its efforts towards auto production and capped the racing team&#x27;s budget at $150 million, of which $50 million went to the engine department.

Rahal recruited McLaren&#x27;s former technical director Adrian Newey, but although Newey reportedly signed a contract with Jaguar, he refused to join the team, citing its fractured internal politics. Rahal also signed decorated chassis designer Steve Nichols. However, following Ressler&#x27;s exit, Reitzle assumed overall control of the team and gave Lauda more authority. Following the , Lauda ousted Rahal and appointed himself team principal. 

===2002 season===

At the end of the 2001 season, Ford moved Guenther Steiner from its rally team to serve as Jaguar&#x27;s managing director. John Allison took responsibility for the commercial and administrative aspects of the business. More broadly, the team&#x27;s budget and performance came under closer scrutiny after Ford CEO Jacques Nasser retired and was replaced by William Clay Ford Jr. Although Nasser was enthusiastic about Formula One, Ford Jr. questioned why the company was spending so much money on a team that did not bear the Ford name.

Jaguar retained the Irvine-de la Rosa pairing for and were rewarded with another improvement in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, finishing seventh, scoring eight points, all from Irvine. Irvine recorded another podium at Monza, which would ultimately be Jaguar&#x27;s last podium in Formula One. However, the team was held back by a disappointing car; at one point it was reported that Lauda was considering reusing the 2001 season&#x27;s car. Lauda blamed the R3&#x27;s poor aerodynamics on the lack of an on-site wind tunnel. Nichols left the team after the R3 performed badly in pre-season testing. Mark Gillan was appointed as technical director.

In mid-2002, Wolfgang Reitzle left Ford as part of a broader corporate reorganisation, declining an offer to take a reshaped role that did not include motorsports. At the end of the season, Ford stripped Lauda of the team principal role and laid off over 60 personnel. Although Lauda was asked to stay in an advisory role, he opted to leave the company, and Ford paid him to sit out the 2003 season.

===2003 season===
To replace Lauda and Steiner, the team hired a new triumvirate of Ford overseer Tony Purnell (replacing Lauda at the Premier Performance Division), managing director David Pitchforth, and sporting and commercial director John Hogan. No team principal was appointed. Hogan complained that he was being &quot;pulled all over the place because Ford in America wanted control,&quot; and left the team at the end of the season. He added that Ford continued to underinvest in the team, and questioned the wisdom of &quot;run[ning] an F1 team on £150m a season.&quot; However, the team benefited from earlier investments in facility upgrades, including the long-awaited wind tunnel. 

For , Irvine and de la Rosa were replaced by Mark Webber and Antônio Pizzonia, a decision made by Lauda shortly before his ouster. In addition, Pizzonia was replaced in mid-season by Justin Wilson. The team jumped from eight to 18 points in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, but remained in seventh place. Webber scored seven times in seventeen races, and Wilson scored an additional point at Indianapolis.

===2004 season===

 marked Jaguar&#x27;s final season in Formula One. The team retained Webber and replaced Wilson with Austrian driver Christian Klien, who reportedly brought in over £10m in sponsorship money from Thai-Austrian energy drink manufacturer Red Bull. Although the team took a step back on track, scoring only ten points in eighteen races, it nonetheless finished seventh in the Constructors&#x27; Championship for a third straight year. At the end of the year, Red Bull bought the team and renamed it to Red Bull Racing.

The team earned an odd form of publicity when two of its engineers adopted an inflatable donkey (acquired following a give-away on a soda can) from the movie &quot;Shrek&quot; as an impromptu team mascot. After the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix, Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley, much of the sport&#x27;s management, and every driver except Michael Schumacher signed the donkey, which the engineers promised to auction off for charity.

In addition, the team set a $300,000 diamond into the nose cone of each car to promote the film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; during the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix. However, Klien crashed on the first lap, and his car&#x27;s diamond was never found. 

==Sports car racing==
===XJR sportscars===
The Jaguar XJR sportscars were a series of sports prototypes that competed in the World Sportscar Championship and IMSA GT Championship between 1984 and 1993. These cars enjoyed high success, with some of the highlights being:

* Silk Cut Jaguar winning the 1987 World Sportscar Championship with the XJR-8;
* Silk Cut Jaguar winning the 1988 World Sportscar Championship, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with the XJR-9;
* Castrol Jaguar winning the 1988 24 Hours of Daytona with the XJR-9;
* Silk Cut Jaguar winning the 1990 24 Hours of Le Mans with the XJR-12;
* Castrol Jaguar winning the 1990 24 Hours of Daytona with the XJR-12;
* Silk Cut Jaguar winning the 1991 World Sportscar Championship with the XJR-14 and XJR-12;
* Justin Law winning the 2008 and 2010 editions of Le Mans Legend with the XJR-12 and XJR-9 respectively.

===GT2===

In 2009, RSR Racing revealed the new Jaguar XKR GT2 car, which the team was to enter the American Le Mans Series&#x27; GT2 class with.

RSR first raced the XKR in the 2010 American Le Mans Series with Paul Gentilozzi, Ryan Dalziel and Marc Goossens. They finished last in the GT class with five points. They also visited that year&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans, but retired early into the race. The team then entered another season in the American Le Mans Series with Cristiano da Matta and Bruno Junqueira, this time finishing ninth (second last) with six points.

===GT3===
The first GT3 iteration of the XKR was developed by Apex Motorsport, which ran these cars in the FIA GT3 European Championship (from 2007 to 2009).

Jaguar then had a fairly long run in the Blancpain GT Series, with the Switzerland-based racing outfit Emil Frey Racing fielding multiple Jaguar XK Emil Frey G3 cars. Those were an in-house development by Emil Frey Racing, with approval from Jaguar, that conformed to full FIA GT3 regulations. The car debuted in the 2012 Blancpain Endurance Series and finished its run in the 2018 Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup. For its farewell season, the car was moved to the Silver Cup and won the championship with the lineup of Alex Fontana, Mikaël Grenier and Adrian Zaugg. It was also third overall in the Endurance Cup Team Rankings. In the previous seasons, the XKRs were run exclusively in the Pro Cup, with the team fielding two cars instead of one in the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

===GT4===

A new entry to the British GT Championship, named Invictus Games Racing and financed by James Holder, fielded two new Jaguar cars for the 2018 season. Despite conforming to standard GT4 regulations, the Jaguar F-Type SVR GT4 was run exclusively in British GT and was not expected to be made available to other customers. The GT4 iteration was developed by Jaguar Land Rover&#x27;s SVO division.

Invictus ran two cars in the 2018 season, both in Pro-Am class. Jason Wolfe and Matthew George were the full-time professional drivers of these cars, while Steve McCulley, Paul Vice, Ben Norfolk and Basil Rawlinson have been selected as the amateur drivers. The entry was reduced to a single car for the 2019 season, with George, McCulley and Vice staying in the team.

The Invictus team disbanded prior to the 2020 season. In February 2020, both cars along with spare parts were auctioned via Silverstone Auctions and eventually sold for £213,750.

==I-Pace eTrophy==

For the 2018–19 season, Jaguar Racing launched a support series for Formula E, dubbed the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY. The series operated an &#x27;Arrive and Drive&#x27; package for up to 20 drivers at each race, including a different VIP driver at every venue. The series would be cancelled after the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1118426" wikidata="Q7154550" url="?curid=1118426" title="Paul Zimmerman (sportswriter)">
<text>Paul Lionel Zimmerman (October 23, 1932November 1, 2018), known to readers as &quot;Dr. Z&quot;, was an American football sportswriter and former player who wrote for the weekly magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, as well as the magazine&#x27;s website, SI.com. He is sometimes confused with Paul B. Zimmerman, a sportswriter who covered football for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; from 1931 to 1968.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Zimmerman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1932 to Charles S. Zimmerman and Rose Zimmerman, and moved to New York in elementary school.

===Playing career===
Zimmerman graduated from Horace Mann School in the Bronx before becoming a college football player at Stanford and Columbia University, where he wrote for the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;. An offensive lineman, he was a member of a United States Army football team while stationed in Germany, and later played minor-league football in 1963 for the Westchester Crusaders of the Atlantic Coast Football League.
Zimmerman was a founder member and player for the rugby union Columbia Old Blues in the 1960s.

===Early journalism career===
Zimmerman began his formal journalism career at the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; and the &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; before moving on to become a regular at the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 1966. In addition to football, Zimmerman covered three Olympic Games for the &quot;Post&quot;, including the hostage crisis at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, Germany.

Zimmerman also wrote a regular wine column for the &quot;Post&quot;, and his wine opinions are often referenced in his weekly mailbag, with football fans adding wine queries to their football questions or comments.

===&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;===
In 1979, Zimmerman moved to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, where he wrote a weekly column and game predictions, and awarded the magazine&#x27;s yearly All-Pros until his stroke. Zimmerman was best known for NFL picks published every week during the NFL season. He was notorious for hedging his bets. For instance, he would &#x27;pick the Cowboys—as long as they can stop the run.&#x27;

Since the mid-1990s, Zimmerman was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; website. Zimmerman provided the site with a weekly column - &quot;Power Rankings&quot; - of his estimations of the relative strengths of each NFL team, as well as a reader mailbag feature, in addition to his other contributions to the magazine.

Zimmerman&#x27;s method of football analysis was a comprehensive one. His charts included both subjective opinions on the players and gameplay, as well as objective statistical information. At any point afterward, he could then give detailed analysis of the players, teams, and games that he charted, tracking who plays well against whom, which players are improving or declining, which superstars are overhyped, and which underrated players to &quot;plug&quot; in his writings.

Zimmerman also answered a weekly on-line mailbag. He wrote in a stream of consciousness style rather than a simple question-and-answer, liberally sprinkling in tidbits of football history, pieces of popular culture, quotations, admittedly bad jokes and puns, rants, and wine advice. He also frequently attributed a running commentary to his wife Linda, &quot;the Flaming Redhead&quot;.

Annually, Zimmerman rated the performance of television NFL sportscasters, criticizing those announcers who did little more than hype the stars while making inane comments on the game, ignoring the strategy or play of the game, or generally making mistakes in their commentaries. Zimmerman also praised the sportscasters who provided meaningful, intelligent commentary for football fans. Zimmerman himself briefly worked as an analyst for NBC&#x27;s NFL coverage in 1985.

While covering the NFL draft for ESPN in the 1980s, Zimmerman was asked what the NFL player of the 1990s would be like. Zimmerman responded, controversially, &quot;The player of the &#x27;90s will be so sophisticated that he&#x27;ll be able to pass any steroid test they come up with,&quot; ending his television career.

Zimmerman had a remarkable year of NFL predictions in 1986. Before the season, he accurately predicted all six division winners and all four wild-card teams, and he also nailed the Super Bowl result, the Giants over the Broncos.

In January 2008, Zimmerman correctly predicted that the New York Giants (an overwhelming underdog) would win Super Bowl XLII over the previously undefeated New England Patriots.

Zimmerman served on the 44-member Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee. He used to be a member of the Hall&#x27;s smaller Senior Committee, a position that Zimmerman resigned in protest over the committee&#x27;s repeated rejection of players he deemed worthy candidates.

===Influences===
Zimmerman&#x27;s style showed similarities to New Journalism, and this influence was especially evident in his web entries. Zimmerman named Jimmy Cannon as one of the sports writers he most admired. Zimmerman described George Orwell as his &quot;literary idol,&quot; and his writing shows some thematic similarities with that of the late novelist.
In the 1980s, Zimmerman, a self-described &quot;round-head&quot;, was the last writer at &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; allowed to continue using a typewriter and fax to file his stories when the rest of the writers had started using computers.

===Books===
Zimmerman wrote the football tome &quot;The Thinking Man&#x27;s Guide to Pro Football&quot; (Dutton; revised edition, 1970) and his 1984 update of that book, &quot;The New Thinking Man&#x27;s Guide to Pro Football&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster). His other books include &quot;Football Lingo&quot; (WW Norton 1967, with Zander Hollander); &quot;The Linebackers&quot; (a 1972 short text for Scholastic Press); &quot;The Last Season of Weeb Ewbank&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1974); and &quot;Duane Thomas and the Fall of America&#x27;s Team&quot; (Warner Books 1988; credited to Thomas and Zimmerman, it contains diary entries by Thomas but otherwise the text is that of Zimmerman). Zimmerman&#x27;s memoir &quot;Dr. Z: The Lost Memoirs of an Irreverent Football Writer&quot; (Triumph Books) was released in September 2017, with stories compiled and edited by Peter King of Sports Illustrated&#x27;s MMQB site.

==Personal life and death==
He was married to Dr. Kate Hart for 20 years. They had two children, Sarah and Michael. Zimmerman married Linda Bailey in 1997.

Zimmerman suffered a stroke on November 22, 2008, which, combined with two later strokes, left him unable to walk or write and only able to speak a few words (yes, no and when); after the stroke, his ability to communicate was extremely limited, only able to make rough gestures. He was still believed to be of sound mind through what he could communicate as of 2013. He died November 1, 2018, from complications of the strokes.

==Legacy==

In 2018, &quot;Sport Illustrated&quot; published &quot;Dr. Z’s Ultimate Legacy,&quot; which called Dr. Z &quot;master of analysis.&quot;

<text>John Robert Hendricks (September 4, 1929 – July 7, 2007) was a Canadian amateur mathematician notable for his work in magic squares and hypercubes. He published many articles in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics as well as other mathematics-related journals.

==Early life, education and career==
Hendricks was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1929, moving with his family to Vancouver, British Columbia, at an early age.

He attended the University of British Columbia and graduated with a B.A. in mathematics.

He began his career as a meteorology instructor in the NATO flight training program, and was subsequently employed for 33 years by the Canadian Meteorological Service, until his retirement in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1984.

Hendricks volunteered for groups including the Monarchist League of Canada and the Manitoba Provincial Council, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award in Canada. He received the Canada 125 medal for his volunteer work.

==Amateur mathematician==
When he was 13, Hendricks started collecting magic squares. As his interest in mathematics grew, so did his love of magic squares, and cubes.

His interest in magic squares led to higher dimensions: magic cubes, tesseracts, etc. He developed a new diagram for the four-dimensional tesseract. This was published in 1962 when he showed constructions of four-, five-, and six-dimensional magic hypercubes of order three. He later was the first to publish diagrams of all 58 magic tesseracts of order 3.

Hendricks was also an authority on the design of inlaid magic squares and cubes (and in 1999, a magic tesseract). Following his retirement, he gave many public lectures on magic squares and cubes in schools and in-service teacher&#x27;s conventions in Canada and the northern United States. He also developed a course on magic squares and cubes which he conducted for seven years at Acadia Junior High School in Winnipeg.

==Later years==
In April 1996, Hendricks and his wife Celia moved to Victoria, British Columbia. By this time, he was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease that meant he had difficulty walking or writing. He purchased a personal computer to help with his self-published work on magic hypercubes, which until this point he had carried out using only a programmable calculator. Despite his deteriorating health, Hendricks continued his work with magic hypercubes, achieving during this time: the first perfect magic tesseract (order 16), in April 1999; the first order 32 perfect magic tesseract; the first inlaid magic tesseract (order 6 with inlaid order 3) in October 1999; and the first bimagic cube (order 25), June 2000.

In 2004, Hendricks was unable to continue with his mathematical work due to ill health. He died in Victoria in 2007, aged 77.

<text>The Standedge Tunnels () are four parallel tunnels through the Pennine hills at the Standedge crossing between Marsden in Kirklees, West Yorkshire and Diggle in Oldham, Greater Manchester in northern England. Three are railway tunnels (containing the Huddersfield line) and the other is a canal tunnel. Before boundary changes in 1974, both ends of the tunnels were in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

The canal tunnel on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 4 April 1794. Construction of a tunnel began months later. Within two years, cost-saving measures pushed back its completion date and progress was slowed by water levels much greater than had been expected. It proved difficult to secure skilled help, some tenders went unanswered and Benjamin Outram withdrew from the venture. In 1807, Thomas Telford drew up a new plan for its completion. In 1811, the tunnel opened. It is the longest and oldest of the four Standedge tunnels and is the longest, highest, and deepest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. Having been closed to all traffic in 1943, the canal tunnel was re-opened in May 2001.

The first, single-track railway tunnel, built for the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on its line between Huddersfield and Manchester, was completed in 1848. It proved to have insufficient capacity and a second, parallel, single-track tunnel was opened in 1871. The LNWR opened a third, double-track tunnel in 1894. Only the double-track tunnel is currently used for rail traffic; the other two are intact but disused.

All four tunnels are linked by cross-tunnels or adits at strategic intervals which allowed the railway tunnels to be built without construction shafts and allowed waste material to be removed by boat. The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre, at the Marsden end, is a base for boat trips into the tunnel and has an exhibition depicting the different crossings.

==Canal tunnel==
===Construction===
On 4 April 1794, construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (then known as the Huddersfield Canal), linking Ashton-under-Lyne and Huddersfield via a tunnel, was authorised by an Act of Parliament. Benjamin Outram was appointed the consulting engineer after his report in October 1793 estimated the cost of the canal and tunnel at £178,478. Nicholas Brown surveyed the route. Outram thought that geology of the hill through which the tunnel would pass was of gritstone and shale, and would not present any difficulties. Work on the tunnel would start at a dip in the hill at Red Brook and the tunnel would be driven simultaneously from both ends. Steam engines would keep the works drained during construction.

Outram was the site engineer and Brown was superintendent and surveyor. During July 1795, John Evans was appointed to manage boring the tunnel. By mid-1796, of tunnel had been cut, some of which had been lined. Considerable effort had been spent constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels to raise spoil and water from intermediate adits. By the autumn, concerned that such work was expensive, Outram abandoned building extra workfaces and concentrated on boring out from both ends. While this was cheaper, the completion date was extended.

Other factors had slowed progress: a shortage of funding and poor working practices also contributed. Cutbacks in drainage provision hampered tunnelling, as larger quantities of water entered the workings. In September 1797, Outram advised the committee that Thomas Lee, the contractor, had made large losses as a result of the difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish the tunnel.

By mid-1799, of the tunnel had been finished and had been excavated, but not completed. In October 1800, the Peak Forest Canal Company, who were keen to trade, suggested a tram road should be built to bypass the tunnel until it was completed, but no action was taken. The next tunnel contract failed to attract any takers and canal engineer John Varley, who had repaired parts of the canal which had been damaged by floods, was invited to work on the tunnel. Soon thereafter, mine owner Matthew Fletcher was asked for his opinion; he suggested that time could be saved by tunnelling in both directions from Redbrook pit, which was kept dry by a large steam engine. He estimated that it would cost £8,000, but a contractor could not be found and tunnelling continued from both ends.

In 1801, Outram resigned after work had stopped for a lengthy period. Brown was dismissed. In late 1804, a sub-committee visited Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal, Butterley Tunnel on the Cromford Canal and the Norwood Tunnel on the Chesterfield Canal. It recommended that a towing path should be built through the tunnel, but the extra cost and delay were not affordable. Desperately short of money, the canal company obtained a new Act of Parliament in 1806 to raise additional finance and allow an extra toll for using the tunnel. In 1807, Thomas Telford was asked for his advice. He produced a plan, which was followed until the work was completed.

On 9 June 1809, both ends of the tunnel met. On 10 December 1810, the first boat passed through. On 26 March 1811, the tunnel was complete and a grand opening ceremony was held on 4 April; a party of invited guests, followed by several working boats, entered the tunnel at Diggle and completed the journey to Marsden in one hour and forty minutes. The tunnel had cost £160,000, making it the most expensive canal tunnel to have been built in Britain. It was also the longest, deepest and highest. The tunnel was long, underground at its deepest point, and above sea level. It was extended at the Marsden end in 1822 by , when Tunnel End Reservoir&#x27;s overflow was diverted over the tunnel mouth. The tunnel was also extended at the Diggle end in 1893 by to accommodate the 1894 rail tunnel. The extensions made the tunnel long. A survey carried out before restoration using a modern measuring system gave the length as , which is the accepted figure.

===Operation===

When the tunnel opened, the canal became a through route, 13 years after the rest of the canal had been completed and 17 years after work began, at a total cost of £123,803. Despite multiple problems, its construction showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced. Telford&#x27;s plan covered every eventuality and was followed until the canal opened. Between 1811 and 1840, the tunnel was used on average by 40 boats daily. The tunnel is brick-lined in some places, though some sections of bare rock were left exposed.

The tunnel is only wide enough for one narrowboat for much of its length and, to save on cost, a towpath was not provided. Canal boats were horse-drawn when it opened and the boats were legged through the tunnel – one or more boatmen lay on the cargo and pushed against the roof or walls of the tunnel with their legs. Professional leggers were paid one shilling and sixpence for working a boat through the tunnel, which took one hour and twenty minutes for an empty boat and three hours with a full load. The limited load capacity and the lack of a towpath damaged the competitiveness of the whole canal when compared to the rival Rochdale Canal, which was only a few miles to the north and competed with the Huddersfield Canal for business.

Although there were widened passing places in the tunnel for handling bi-directional traffic, intense competition between boat crews was a hindrance and two-way operation in the tunnel was impractical. The canal company introduced one-way working, for which one end of the tunnel was closed by a locked chain to prevent access unless authorised. A similar arrangement remains in use.

In 1846, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was purchased by the Huddersfield &amp; Manchester Railway. The canal tunnel was used during the construction of the first railway tunnel and no shafts were needed. The canal provided an easy means of removing the excavated spoil. When the railway tunnel was completed, several cross passages were retained.

The last commercial boat passed through the tunnel in 1921 and the canal was closed to traffic in 1944 when maintenance ended and the tunnel fell into a state of disrepair. The last boat to pass through the tunnel before its restoration was the Rolt/Aickman expedition in the &quot;Ailsa Craig&quot; in 1948. Writing in 1948, L. T. C. Rolt described the journey as taking two hours, during which the speed was kept very low to avoid damage to the boat.

The canal had become obstructed in several places on both sides of the Pennines and the tunnel, which had become unsafe, was closed by large iron gates at each end. A local newspaper described a trip organised by the Railway and Canal Historical Society during 1961, which was held to commemorate 150 years since the canal&#x27;s opening. The expedition used a single narrowboat, which departed Marsden around 11 a.m. and emerged from the Diggle portal around 1 p.m.

===Restoration===
The canal and tunnel benefitted from a £5 million restoration project to re-open the canal. Several rock-lined parts of the tunnel were stabilised by rock bolts where possible and concrete was used to stabilise the rock face where this was impractical. In May 2001, the tunnel was re-opened to traffic. Most modern canal boats are diesel-powered and it was considered unsafe for boaters to navigate the tunnel using diesel power because of its length and the lack of ventilation, so electric tug boats haul the narrowboats through. Since the 2009 season, boats have been allowed to travel through the tunnel under their own power with an experienced chaperone on board to guide its passage, followed by a service vehicle through one of the parallel disused railway tunnels.

==Railway tunnels==

Three railway tunnels run parallel to each other and the canal tunnel. Through them runs the Huddersfield line. They are level for the whole length, which had the operational benefit of providing the only section of level track on the line where water troughs could be installed to provide steam locomotives with water without requiring the train to stop. Both the single-track bores have ventilation shafts at Cote, Flint and Pule Hill, and the double-track tunnel is ventilated via three shafts at Brunn Clough, Redbrook and Flint. Drainage adits interlink with one another, including the canal tunnel, into which water is discharged.

In 1846, work commenced on a railway tunnel for the Huddersfield &amp; Manchester Railway. It ran parallel to, and to the south of, the canal tunnel at a slightly higher level. From the canal tunnel, thirteen adits were driven to facilitate excavating the railway tunnel. The railway company had bought the canal company to provide access. Boats transferred excavated spoil and moved construction materials. Canal access increased the rate of construction, which took a little over two years; in comparison, the Woodhead Tunnel, which was slightly shorter, took seven years to build despite the work being done by the same contractor, Thomas Nicholson.
The tunnel was driven and lined by up to 1,953 navvies working 36 faces. The tunnel advanced at up to per week. Nine men died during its construction. In 1848, the central single-track tunnel was completed by the London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR), who had acquired the Huddersfield &amp; Manchester Railway midway through its construction. Costing £201,608, the tunnel is long. When opened, trains were accompanied through the tunnel by a pilot man or pilot engine and their re-emergence was communicated between signal boxes situated at either end by a telegraph system devised by Henry Highton.

The 1848 tunnel soon became a bottleneck for rail traffic between Huddersfield and Manchester. Even before its completion, plans were in consideration for a second tunnel alongside it. When the economic case became clear, Thomas Nelson, who built the first railway tunnel, was awarded the contract. As with the first tunnel, the canal tunnel was linked to the second by 21 adits which passed underneath Nicholson&#x27;s tunnel, allowing spoil to be removed by boat. Construction was disrupted by strike action by tunnellers and bricklayers over disputes about payment and shift length. In February 1871, the second rail tunnel, south of the first, was opened.

Even two tunnels could not provide sufficient capacity to satisfy demand and in 1890, the L&amp;NWR embarked on providing four tracks on most of the line which required constructing a new twin-track tunnel.

Construction was done under the guidance of A. A. MacGregor and carried out by 1,800 men who lived in the paper mills at Diggle and 54 wooden huts near the eastern side. Once again the tunnel was driven from adits, this time 13 adits were connected to the first railway tunnel. The canal tunnel was extended at the Diggle end to accommodate the third rail tunnel, which ran close past it. For most of its length, the new bore is to the north of the canal tunnel, but passes over the canal tunnel just inside each tunnel entrance. When the work was completed, the tunnel was long. To speed the excavation, 40 breakups were opened using around of gelignite. About 25 million bricks, mostly produced locally, were used in the tunnel lining.

A unlined section of tunnel collapsed in April 1894 blocking the tunnel for a week. On 1 August 1894, the new tunnel was passed for use by inspector Major Yorke. The opening of the double-track tunnel provided additional capacity for the L&amp;NWR, allowing them to temporarily close the single bores for maintenance. As of 2018, excluding the London Underground, the double-track bore is the fifth-longest UK rail tunnel, after the High Speed 1 tunnels for the Thames Estuary and English Channel, the Severn Tunnel on the Great Western Main Line, and the Totley Tunnel on the Sheffield to Manchester route.

Only the 1894 rail tunnel is in use but all three rail tunnels are maintained. In 1966, the 1848 single-track rail tunnel was closed followed by the 1871 single-track tunnel in 1970. The 1848 tunnel provides an emergency escape route for the other tunnels and has been made accessible to road vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances. Both the 1848 and 1871 tunnel are used by maintenance personnel for access. During the 2000s, Network Rail proposed reinstating rail traffic through the 1848 and 1871 tunnels to increase capacity on the Leeds–Manchester Transpennine route, but a reappraisal in 2012 following the decision to electrify the Transpennine line found that reinstatement would not be necessary.

==Visitor centre==

The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre at the Marsden end of the tunnel is in the former warehouse, used for transshipment of goods from canal barge to packhorse between 1798 when the canal reached Marsden, and 1811 when the tunnel opened. The centre contains exhibitions on the history of the tunnels, the canal tunnel&#x27;s recent restoration and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. Tunnel End Cottages, which once housed canal maintenance workers, houses a café and the booking office for canal tunnel trips.

The visitor centre is about half a mile (0.8 km) west of Marsden railway station, reached via the canal towpath. Next to the station are the headquarters of the National Trust&#x27;s Marsden Moor Estate which has a public exhibition, &quot;Welcome to Marsden&quot;, that gives an overview of the area and its transport history.
