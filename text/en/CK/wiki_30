<text>Peasant Battalions (, abbreviated BCh) was a Polish resistance movement, guerrilla and partisan organisation, during World War II. The organisation was created in mid-1940 by the agrarian political party People&#x27;s Party and by 1944 was partially integrated with the Armia Krajowa (Home Army). At its height, in summer 1944 the organisation had 160,000 members.

==History==

Initially after the occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union and Germany, the peasant parties were reluctant to forming their own armed resistance forces. Since mid-1940 several smaller groups were formed, mostly for self-defence of Polish peasants against German terror and economic policies. Most of members of peasant parties grouped into CKRL (&quot;Central Directorate of Peasant Movement&quot;) who received military training before the war were transferred to other armed resistance organizations, most notably to ZWZ.

However, in early 1941 it was decided that an armed force be created. The core of the newly formed BCh came from the earlier organization Chłostra (an acronym of &quot;Chłopska Straż&quot; - Farmers&#x27; Guard), as well as from other underground organizations of the farmers movement, such as Związek Młodzieży Wiejskiej (&quot;Association of Rural Youth&quot;), Chłopska Organizacja Wolności &quot;Racławice&quot; (&quot;Peasants&#x27; Freedom Organization &quot;Racławice&quot;&quot;) and Centralny Związek Młodej Wsi &quot;Siew&quot; (&quot;Central Union of Village Youth &quot;Sowing&quot;&quot;).

The structure of the BCh was based on pre-war administrative divisions of Poland. Areas were roughly correspondent to pre-war Voivodeships, and were further divided onto districts (based on powiats) and commune-based units. By mid-1943 10 areas were formed:
:# Warsaw
:# Warsaw Voivodeship
:# Kielce
:# Lublin
:# Łódź
:# Kraków, Rzeszów, Silesia
:# Białystok
:# Volhynia
:# Lwów, Stanisławów, Tarnopol
:# Poznań

Each of the areas fielded its own armed units. The units were basically of two types:
# territorial militias - created for self-defense, sabotage and preparation of future all-national uprising
# tactical units - strictly militarized, created for use as the core of the future all-national uprising
The units of the latter type were later mostly joined with the Armia Krajowa. The commander of the BCh was Franciszek Kamiński, his chiefs of staff were Kazimierz Banach (until 1942) and S. Koter.

During the process of unification of Polish underground, large part (approximately 50 000 men) of the BCh soldiers was integrated by the Government Delegate&#x27;s Office at Home with Armia Krajowa and Państwowy Korpus Bezpieczeństwa. Also, by early 1943 part of the tactical units were transformed into Special Units specialized in diversion and reprisal actions. An estimate for summer 1944 the Bataliony Chłopskie had approximately 160 000 members grouped in 70 units.
However, the full unification with the Armia Krajowa did not occur until the end of the war.

After the Red Army entered Poland, elements of BCh started to cooperate with the communist-backed Armia Ludowa, while the majority remained loyal to the Polish government. However, the incoming end of the war, as well as information of the Yalta Conference made further resistance futile and on 2 April 1945 most of the Bataliony Chłopskie units came out from the underground. Some of the soldiers were arrested by the communists, while others joined the reestablished People&#x27;s Party of Stanisław Mikołajczyk. Formally the Bataliony Chłopskie were dissolved in September 1945.

==Tasks and actions==
The main tasks of Bataliony Chłopskie were:
:# Defense of the peasants against German economic exploitation
:# Defense of peasants against expulsions
:# Self-defense against German terror
:# Aid to the expelled, Jews, the intelligentsia, and to the families of those enslaved by the Germans.

The first major actions of armed resistance began in late 1942 when the Zamość area, due to its fertile black soil, was chosen for German colonization as part of Generalplan Ost. Polish farmers were expropriated and forcibly expelled from the farms with great brutality. Their farms were handed over to German settlers. A minority of the children were separated from their parents and after racial scrutiny sent over to Germany to be raised in German families, but thousands of those &quot;not suitable for 
Germanization&quot; were dispatched to perform slave labor for the Germans or were murdered by the Germans. After several major battles against German units (the most notable being the battles of Wojda, Róża and Zaboreczno), the Germans had to halt the expulsions and in the end very few German settlers were brought to the area (see Zamość Uprising).

Other major actions included liberation of prisoners from prisons in Pińczów and Krasnystaw as well as the sinking of German river patrol ship Tannenberg on the Vistula.

<doc id="1125918" wikidata="Q5456820" url="?curid=1125918" title="Flag of Salt Lake City">
<text>The flag of Salt Lake City, Utah consists of two horizontal bars of blue and white with a sego lily in the canton. It was adopted in 2020 after a city-wide contest to replace a previous flag.

==Historical flags==
== 1854 design ==
The first city flag was made in 1854 and was describe as: &quot;...elegant banner of this city whereon is inscribed &quot;Municipality, Order, Justice, G.S.L. city.&quot;

==1963 design==
The second adopted city flag was designed in 1963 by J. Rulon Hales, the winner of a contest run by the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. The first version of the flag was made by art students from Highland High School and officially adopted for use on November 13, 1969. It included seagulls, pioneers, a covered wagon, and the sun rising over the Wasatch Mountains in the middle of a white background. The center was in the general shape of a beehive, which is a symbol of industry and relates to the founding of Salt Lake City and its Mormon heritage.

==2006 design==
The third design of the flag was approved on October 4, 2006, by the Salt Lake City Council. Rocky Anderson, the mayor of Salt Lake City at the time, had sponsored a contest in 2004 to redesign the flag. Anderson argued that the &quot;old flag was too exclusive and focused entirely on the city&#x27;s Mormon heritage.&quot;

The contest, which received more than 50 entries, did not produce any designs that the city council felt had the &quot;symbolic visuals that could be associated with Salt Lake City&quot;. They then formed a subcommittee to work with the mayor&#x27;s office to create new designs for the flag. The final design was approved with a 4–2 margin.

==2020 design==

In May 2020, the city government opened a two-month contest to redesign the flag with a $3,000 prize for the winning entry. The city received over 600 design entries, of which eight finalists were selected in July by the Flag Design Review Committee for public review. The winning design, announced in September 2020, was created through the merger of two finalists created by Arianna Meinking and Elio Kennedy-Yoon from West High School. The design features a sego lily, the Utah state flower, in the canton amidst horizontal fields of blue and white. It was sent to the city council for consideration with the endorsement of mayor Erin Mendenhall and adopted on October 6, 2020.

<doc id="1125928" wikidata="Q8032506" url="?curid=1125928" title="Woodchuck Hard Cider">
<text>Woodchuck Hard Cider is a brand of hard cider produced by the Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC, in Middlebury, Vermont. In 2011 it was the top-selling hard cider in the United States, capturing approximately 47% of the hard cider market in the country.

== History ==
Woodchuck was founded at The Joseph Cerniglia Winery in Proctorsville, Vermont, in 1991 by Joe Cerniglia and Barry Blake, along with wine maker Greg Failing. While cider production began in Cerniglia&#x27;s winery, by 1996 the company was producing 400,000 cases of product per year, necessitating a move to a cidery in Springfield, Vermont.

In 2000, Woodchuck moved to its current production facility in Middlebury, Vermont, and by 2007 had become the first cider company in the nation to sell one million cases in one year. In 2012, Woodchuck Hard Cider was purchased by Irish beverage company C&amp;C Group.

In March 2021, C&amp;C Group announced their intent to sell Vermont Hard Cider Company to Northeast Drinks Group, a Vermont-based company, for 20 million dollars. According to executive David Mandler, the group was founded specifically in order to procure Vermont Hard Cider Company, and all employees and contracts will remain in place upon purchase. The sale was officially completed in April 2021. 

==Varieties==
Woodchuck currently offers ten core styles available in either bottles or cans, with the option to purchase a variety pack that comes with a combination of flavors. The company also offers a low calorie variety pack containing four fruit-flavored ciders, as well as a single cider in the company&#x27;s 802 Collection, a product line that focuses on using solely Vermont-sourced apples at all levels of productions.

All Woodchuck ciders are made from apples and other fruits, and are therefore gluten-free as there is no grain involved in production process.

==Core styles==

*Amber – Hard cider crafted made solely from red apples with no added flavors
*Sangria – Hard pear cider flavored with citrus and berries, inspired by sangria
*Granny Smith – Hard cider made from Granny Smith apples with no added flavors
*Pear – Hard cider with pear flavoring added
*Sippin&#x27; Citrus – Hard apple cider flavored with grapefruit and cascade hops
*Mimosa – Hard cider flavored with orange and vanilla, inspired by the mimosa
*Bubbly Pearsecco – Hard pear cider inspired by prosecco
*Bubbly Rosé – Hard apple cider inspired by rosé wine
*Raspberry – Hard cider with raspberry flavoring added
*Semi-Dry – Hard cider made from bittersweet apples with no added flavors

== Other styles ==

* The following four styles are only offered as part of the Woodchuck 100 Variety Pack, and each contain 100 calories and 2 grams of sugar.
** Black Cherry
** Cranberry Lime
** Watermelon
** Citrus
* Lil&#x27; Dry – Hard cider made from fresh pressed Vermont apple juice. This product is made in conjunction with Woodchuck&#x27;s partner orchards, and is the sole product within the company&#x27;s 802 Collection.

==Limited releases==

Beginning in 2008, Woodchuck released multiple limited-edition products that corresponded with the time of year. In 2018, the seasonal releases were scrapped as Woodchuck unveiled the Tank Series, a line of limited-release ciders that would enter the market for roughly four months before being replaced with a new product.
*Spring – Hard cider flavored with locally-sourced maple syrup and brown sugar. This product was released in Spring 2011.
*Belgian White – Hard cider brewed with Belgian beer yeast. Originally released in 2012 in Woodchuck&#x27;s Private Reserve line, this product was brought back as a limited release in Winter 2019 due to constant requests from consumers.
*Pumpkin – Oak aged hard cider flavored with pumpkins. This product was released in Fall 2019, and crafted with a similar formula to the company&#x27;s Private Reserve Pumpkin Cider first released in 2010.

==Private reserves==
Woodchuck&#x27;s Private Reserve line was first unveiled in 2010 with the launch of Private Reserve Pumpkin, a hard cider which they claimed to be the world&#x27;s first pumpkin cider. Other releases include the Private Reserve Barrel Select, a product aged for six months in oak bourbon barrels along with a Woodchuck Belgian White, a cider that&#x27;s produced using Belgian beer yeast.

<text>The solitary ascidian Herdmania momus is one of the most commonly encountered species of ascidians. While commonly referred to simply as &quot;sea squirts&quot;, this name is ambiguous, as it can refer to any member of the sub-phylum Tunicata.

This solitary ascidian is sometimes referred to as the &quot;red-throated ascidian&quot;, as its two siphons are a vivid red in colour. However, most solitary ascidians that are encountered are so covered in algae that the coloration is often not visible. When found at depth the red colourations may also not be visible, as lower frequencies of light are absorbed by the layers of water above.

Like all ascidians, &quot;H. momus&quot; is a sessile filter feeder. It is commonly found attached to rocks from depths of 3–50 metres (10–160 ft).

<doc id="1125953" wikidata="Q2856140" url="?curid=1125953" title="Race Rocks Light">
<text>Race Rocks Light is one of the first two lighthouses that were built on the west coast of Canada, financed by the British Government and illuminated in 1860. It is the only lighthouse on that coast built of rock, (granite) purportedly quarried in Scotland, and topped with sandstone quarried on Gabriola Island. The Islands of Race Rocks are located just off the southern tip of Vancouver Island, about southwest of Victoria, British Columbia.

==History==
The lighthouse was built between 1859–1860 by the crew of HMS &quot;Topaze&quot; and outside labourers under a contract awarded to John Morris by the British Government. It was illuminated on 26 December 1860, six weeks after the smaller Fisgard Island lighthouse built at the entrance to Esquimalt Harbour near Victoria. In 2010, both lighthouses celebrated their sesquicentennial. See A complete history of the Light Station and Ecological Reserve.

It has a 24.4 m (80 feet) cylindrical tower with black and white bands, and flashes a white light every 10 seconds. Its foghorn sounds three blasts at one-minute intervals.

The lighthouse has been automated since 1997 at which time Lester B. Pearson College took over the management of the station and the surrounding Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. Restoration of the interior and exterior of the historic light tower was carried out in 2009.

==Oceanographic research==

The Race Rocks Light is one of 12 lighthouses part of the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program, collecting coastal water temperature and salinity measurements everyday since 1921.

<text>Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Sylvanus Thayer (June 9, 1785 – September 7, 1872) also known as the &quot;Father of the Military Academy&quot;, was an early superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and an early advocate of engineering education in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Sylvanus Thayer was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, the son of Nathaniel Thayer, a gentleman farmer, and his wife Dorcas Faxon. 
In 1793, at the age of 8, Thayer was sent to live with his uncle Azariah Faxon and attend school in Washington, New Hampshire. There he met General Benjamin Pierce, who, like Faxon, was a veteran of the Revolutionary War. 
In 1803 Thayer matriculated at Dartmouth College, graduating in 1807 as valedictorian of his class. However, he never gave the valedictory address at Dartmouth, having been granted an appointment to West Point by President Thomas Jefferson at the behest of General Pierce. Thayer graduated from the United States Military Academy after a single year and received his commission as a second lieutenant in 1808. His first assignment was to supervise the construction of Fort Warren (later renamed Fort Winthrop) in Boston Harbor, foreshadowing the bulk of his later career.

During the War of 1812, Thayer directed the fortification and defense of Norfolk, Virginia, and was promoted to major. In 1815, he was provided $5,000 to travel to Europe, where he studied for two years at the French École Polytechnique. While traveling in Europe he amassed a collection of science and especially mathematics texts that now form a valuable collection for historians of mathematics.

==Superintendent of West Point==
In 1817, President James Monroe ordered Thayer to West Point to become superintendent of the Military Academy following the resignation of Captain Alden Partridge. Under his stewardship, the Academy became the nation&#x27;s first college of engineering.

While at West Point Thayer established numerous traditions and policies which are still in use at West Point. These include the values of honor and responsibility, strict mental and physical discipline, the demerit system, summer encampment, high academic standards and the requirement that cadets maintain outstanding military bearing and appearance at all times.

One of Thayer&#x27;s reforms was to establish a standard four year curriculum with the cadets organized into four classes. Starting with the Class of 1823, July 1 was the date each year when the graduating class was commissioned and the entering class was sworn in. The graduation date was moved up to June 15 starting in 1861.

Many of the cadets who attended West Point during Thayer&#x27;s tenure held key leadership positions during the Mexican War and American Civil War.
==Later career==
Colonel Thayer&#x27;s time at West Point ended with his resignation in 1833, after a disagreement with President Andrew Jackson. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834.

Thayer returned to duty with the Army Corps of Engineers. Thayer spent the great majority of the next 30 years as the chief engineer for the Boston area. During this time he oversaw the construction of both Fort Warren and Fort Independence to defend Boston Harbor. Thayer&#x27;s great engineering ability can be observed in both of the above-mentioned forts. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1838.

Thayer was a member of the Board of Engineers for Coast Defenses, April 2, 1833, to December 21, 1857, and was President of the Board from Dec. 7, 1838. He temporarily commanded of the Corps of Engineers from December 21, 1857, to December 22, 1858, while its commander, Colonel Joseph G. Totten, was on a leave of absence. In December 1858 Thayer was placed on an extended sick leave of absence. He did not play an active role in the American Civil War.

In August 1861, Fort Thayer, an earthwork fort part of the Civil War Defenses of Washington, DC, was built and named in his honor.

Thayer retired from the Army on June 1, 1863, with the rank of colonel in the Corps of Engineers. He was retired under the first act regulating the retirement of Army officers which required the retirement of any officer with more than 45 years of service.

==Death and legacy==
In 1869, as a result of Thayer&#x27;s enduring legacy at the United States Military Academy, a meeting took place in Braintree between Thayer and the West Point graduate and Civil War hero Brigadier General Robert Anderson. An outcome of Anderson&#x27;s 1869 meeting with Thayer was the establishment of the Military Academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates (AoG).

In 1867, Thayer donated $40,000 to the trustees of Dartmouth College to create the Thayer School of Engineering. Thayer personally located and recommended USMA graduate Lieutenant Robert Fletcher to Dartmouth president Asa Dodge Smith. Fletcher became the school&#x27;s first—then only—professor and dean.

The Thayer School admitted its first three students to a graduate program in 1871. Also in 1871 at the bequest of his will Thayer Academy in Braintree, Massachusetts, was conceived. It opened September 12, 1877.

Thayer died on September 7, 1872, at his home in Braintree. He was reinterred at West Point Cemetery in 1877. Thayer&#x27;s obituary appeared in the New York Times on September 8, 1872.

==Works==
Thayer&#x27;s papers and manuscripts are divided between the U.S. Military Academy Library, West Point, New York, and the Dartmouth College Library, Hanover, New Hampshire.

==Honours, decorations, awards, and distinctions==
In 1852 herpetologists Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Frédéric Girard of the Smithsonian Institution named a species of lizard in honor of Thayer, &quot;Sceloporus thayeri&quot;, which was later placed in the synonymy of &quot;Sceloporus undulatus hyacinthinus&quot;.

On April 21, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Thayer for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from May 31, 1863, the day before he retired, for long and faithful service. The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on April 27, 1864.

To honor his achievements, in 1958, the Sylvanus Thayer Award was created by the United States Military Academy.
He has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a 9¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

Thayer Street, in the Inwood, Manhattan section of New York City, is named after him.

The house where Thayer was born in Braintree, Massachusetts is preserved and open to the public.

Sculptor Joseph Kiselewski created a thirty-two inch bust of Sylvanus Thayer for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans at New York University in the Bronx, New York City. It was installed in 1966.

&quot;The Pale Blue Eye&quot; (2022) is a film adaptation of the 2003 novel by Louis Bayard featuring Timothy Spall as Thayer.

<text>Southwestern University (Southwestern or SU) is a private liberal arts college in Georgetown, Texas. Formed in 1873 from a revival of collegiate charters granted in 1840, Southwestern is the oldest college or university in Texas. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Music and historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church.

The institution is a member of the Annapolis Group, the Associated Colleges of the South, the Council of Independent Colleges, and is a signatory of the Talloires Declaration.

==History==

Prior to assuming its current form, charters had been granted by the Texas Legislature (Texas Congress 1836–1845) to establish four educational institutions: Rutersville College, Wesleyan College McKenzie College and Soule University.

In 1870, a charter was granted to a new institution, known as Texas University, that would be a union of these four previously-independent institutions. This new university would open its doors in Georgetown three years later in 1873. Intending to reserve that name for a proposed state university in Austin, the University of Texas, the Texas Legislature instead granted a charter in 1875 under the name Southwestern University as a continuation of the charters for Rutersville, Wesleyan, McKenzie, and Soule. The institution considers its founding date to be 1840 when Rutersville College opened. 

Southwestern was a charter member of the Southwest Conference in 1915. Southern Methodist University was Southwestern&#x27;s main rival for several decades in remembrance of an unsuccessful attempt to relocate Southwestern to Dallas which instead resulted in the establishment of SMU. When SMU&#x27;s student population became much larger, students at Southwestern began considering Trinity University and Austin College to be the school&#x27;s main rivals. After World War II, Southwestern became a small liberal arts institution, discontinuing its post-graduate degrees, disbanding the football team, and rebuilding much of the campus with a massive capital campaign. The endowment rose substantially. 

Until 1965, no African-Americans were allowed to attend the institution. In 1965, Ernest Clark enrolled; he graduated in 1969.

Former president Edward B. Burger stepped down in January 2020 and assumed the role of president and CEO of St. David&#x27;s Foundation. Southwestern trustee and former provost Dale T. Knobel assumed interim presidency of Southwestern until Laura Skandera Trombley began her term as president on July 1, 2020.

==Academics==
The institution offers 40 majors and 36 minors divided between the Brown College of Arts, Garey School of Natural Sciences, and the Sarofim School of Fine Arts.

In the 2013–2014 academic year, total student enrollment was at 1,536, with a gender distribution of about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Of the entering first-year students in Fall 2013, 37 percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class with an average SAT score of 1166 (writing section not included). The majority of students come from Texas (89 percent); the remaining 11 percent come from 23 other states and 6 countries. Minority students constitute 33 percent of the student body.

The student to faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 15 students. Ninety-nine percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty hold a doctorate or highest degree in their fields. 

===Rankings and reputation===
In its 2024-2025 edition, USNews and World Report ranked Southwesten College tied at 83rd out of 211 National Liberal Arts Colleges.

Loren Pope, former education editor for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, included Southwestern in his 1996 book, &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;, and in a 2012 update to that book.

==Campus==
Southwestern University is located in Georgetown, Texas, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Austin. The campus comprises 700 acres (2.8 km²) mostly located north of University Avenue, although the eastern portion of these lands remains largely undeveloped. The main campus is organized around a central academic mall formed by a semi-circular grassy area bounded by a pedestrian walkway and academic buildings. Residence halls and on-campus apartments are located to the east and northwest of the academic mall. Sports fields, support facilities, and parking are on the periphery of the main campus.

===Notable buildings===
The Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building (formerly called the Administration Building) was built in 1898 in the Richardsonian Romanesque style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is named in honor of Hugh Roy Cullen and his wife.

Mood-Bridwell Hall, originally a men&#x27;s dormitory, was completed in 1908 and currently houses classrooms, faculty offices, a computer lab, the Debbie Ellis Writing Center, and an indoor atrium. Mood-Bridwell is included in the Cullen Building&#x27;s listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Lois Perkins Chapel was built in 1950 and includes an Aeolian-Skinner pipe organ. Stained glass windows along the east and west sides depict Reformation leaders and Methodist leaders with seals for the educational institutions they were affiliated with.

The Fayez Sarofim School of Fine Arts is housed in the Alma Thomas Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1956 on the former property of the Texas rancher Dudley Hiram Snyder, a Southwestern University benefactor. The Fine Arts Building (FAB) has been renovated multiple times, most recently in 1998 and 2008. The FAB houses the 700-seat Alma Thomas Theater, the smaller Jones Theater, the Caldwell-Carvey Foyer, numerous practice rooms, art studios, a black box theater, and an instrumental rehearsal hall.

==Student activities and organizations==

There are over 90 student organizations on campus. The school hosts chapters of 16 academic honor societies, including a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a chapter of Beta Beta Beta (TriBeta), and the founding chapter of the Alpha Chi honor society. The national co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega also has a chapter. Several groups on campus participate in social activism and awareness on campus and in the Austin area, including College Democrats, Students for Environmental Activism and Knowledge (SEAK), Latinos Unidos, EBONY, and Amnesty International. Religious groups on campus include the national Christian fraternities Kappa Upsilon Chi, Christian sorority Sigma Phi Lambda, Jewish Student Association, Muslims and Allies, and Buddhist Meditation Group. Other groups include Southwestern Breakaway, Mock Trial, Student Health Advisory Council (SHAC), Best Buddies, Cat Partners, Exercise is Medicine, Robotics Club, Business Club, and much more.

===Student government===
Student government is primarily handled by the Student Congress, with each member elected to represent students living in residence halls, Greek houses, and at-large for students living off-campus. The Student Congress is headed by a president elected through popular vote. An independent organization, Student Foundation, serves as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and the administration. A panel of students and faculty maintain the institution&#x27;s honor code, replacing the Student Judiciary which previously adjudicated violations of the honor code.

===Greek life===

Southwestern hosts eight national social fraternities and sororities. All fraternities occupy houses on the western side of the campus. The sororities do not have dedicated housing, although they maintain chapter rooms in the Lord Caskey Center.

Southwestern also has the Alpha Tau chapter of Kappa Delta Chi sorority. The Alpha Tau chapter is also a member of Southwestern’s umbrella organization the Coalition for Diversity and Social Justice.

===Media===
&quot;The Megaphone&quot;, established in 1907, is the official student newspaper of Southwestern University. Published online and biweekly in print, the newspaper focuses on the campus community, including sections on news, features, opinions/editorials, culture, and sports. Throughout its history, the Megaphone has changed formats several times, alternating between broadsheets and tabloid paper. The newspaper publishes an April Fool&#x27;s Day edition every spring under the title &quot;The Megaphool&quot;.

&quot;Spyglass Literary Magazine&quot; is the student literary magazine. The magazine is the oldest publication on campus, established in 1882 as the &quot;Alamo and San Jacinto Monthly&quot; and renamed the &quot;Southwestern University Monthly&quot; in 1895, then the &quot;SU Literary Magazine&quot;, and finally &quot;The Spyglass&quot; in 2012. Currently published twice a year at the end of each semester, the magazine features student poetry, short stories, artwork, and photography.

&quot;SU Radio&quot; is an online radio station broadcasting music and student commentary in hour-long programming blocks.

==Athletics==

Southwestern is a member of the NCAA Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) and an affiliate member of the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) for football, with all other sports moving to SAA in 2025. Southwestern competes in 20 varsity sports, including football, basketball, cross country, track &amp; field, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, lacrosse, men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s volleyball and women&#x27;s softball. Intramural sports on campus include handball, rock climbing, and ultimate frisbee. The school mascot is the pirate.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse team became a varsity sport in 2009 after offering lacrosse as a club sport for 25 years. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team won the Lonestar Alliance Division II Championship for four consecutive years prior to becoming a varsity sport. The women&#x27;s team is currently non-varsity and is affiliated with the Texas Women&#x27;s Lacrosse League, although the institution plans to field a varsity team in 2014. The women&#x27;s team won a division championships in 2007.

In addition to lacrosse, Southwestern has a nationally ranked handball team that won the Division II National Collegiate Championship in 2007. In September 2016, Southwestern&#x27;s volleyball team moved up to 3rd place in the AVCA coaches poll as well.

Southwestern reinstated football in 2013 after a 62-year hiatus. The institution previously fielded football teams from 1908 to 1951, reaching national prominence during World War II when the institution&#x27;s participation in the Navy&#x27;s V-12 College Training Program enlisted talented players from other schools. Southwestern was a founding member of the Southwest Conference and won the Sun Bowl in 1944 and 1945.

Southwestern University Women’s Soccer team won its first-ever SCAC Championship in 2019, defeating Trinity University on penalty kicks.

<text>Willistead Manor is a historic house located in the former town of Walkerville, Ontario, now part of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Willistead Manor was designed by renowned architect Albert Kahn in the 16th-century Tudor-Jacobean style of an English manor house. It was built in 1904–1906, and was commissioned by Edward Chandler Walker, the second son of Hiram Walker. It is named after the first son, Willis Walker, a lawyer in Detroit, Michigan, who died young.

Contrary to popular belief, Hiram Walker never lived in the home. Edward and his wife never had any children. After Edward passed on in 1915, Mrs. Walker did not care to keep living in the big home alone, and she deeded the house and grounds to the town of Walkerville. When Walkerville was amalgamated with Windsor in 1935, it obtained ownership of Willistead.

In the years after its use as a residence, Willistead served as the Walkerville Town Hall, Art Gallery of Windsor and as a public library branch. In the late 1970s early 1980s, the City of Windsor, afraid of the repairs and upkeep on the mansion, wanted to demolish the structure. Preservationists stepped in and the home was saved. In 1976, Windsor City Council designated Willistead Manor and Park as a heritage property. 

Today the 36-room mansion is used as a banquet hall, and the fifteen-acre (62,888 m2) grounds are incorporated in a larger public park. The house can be rented for occasions such as weddings, corporate meeting and private parties. The house is also decorated for the Christmas holiday.

<doc id="1125970" wikidata="Q1501257" url="?curid=1125970" title="Vegetable juice">
<text>Vegetable juice is a juice drink made primarily of blended vegetables and also available in the form of powders. Vegetable juice is often mixed with fruits such as apples or grapes to improve flavor. It is often touted as a low-sugar alternative to fruit juice, although some commercial brands of vegetable juices use fruit juices as sweeteners, and may contain large amounts of sodium.

== Home-made juice ==

Making vegetable juice at home is an alternative to buying commercial juices, and may augment diets low in vegetables and fruits. The juicer separates juice from pulp fibers. Masticating juicers employ a slow-geared grinding mechanism. A cheaper and faster alternative uses centrifugal force to achieve separation. The slower speed of the masticating process is held to protect the vegetables from oxidation and heat (from friction), reducing nutrient breakdown. Advocates of masticating juicers often cite the preservation of enzymes, though these are rarely specified and the claims are unsubstantiated by a body of academic support. Juicing the fine leaves of wheatgrass usually requires a masticating process.

== Varieties ==

Commercial vegetable juices are commonly made from varying combinations of carrots, beets, pumpkin, and tomatoes. The latter two, although not technically vegetables, are commonly used to increase palatability. Other popular items in vegetable juices are parsley, dandelion greens, kale, celery, fennel, and cucumbers. Lemon, garlic and ginger may be added by some for medicinal purposes.

Other common juices include carrot juice, tomato juice, and turnip juice.

In Asian cultures, primarily Chinese, &quot;Chinese yam&quot; (Chinese: &quot;shān yào&quot;, Japanese: &quot;nagaimo&quot;) is also used for vegetable juices. They are used quite sparingly, however, for many Chinese consider it to be a medicine rather than a vegetable.

Kale juice marketed as &quot;Aojiru&quot; in Japan has become well known for its purported health benefits and bitter taste.

Japan also markets several kinds of vegetable juices which, unlike Western juices, usually depend on carrots and fruits instead of large amounts of tomato juice for their flavor.

==Nutrition==
In general, vegetable juices are recommended as supplements to whole vegetables, rather than as a replacement. However, the actual nutritional value of juices versus whole vegetables is still contested.

USDA guidelines for Americans states that 3/4 cup of 100% vegetable juice is equivalent to one serving of vegetables. This is upheld by a 2006 study, which found that juices provide similar health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer although the authors noted &quot;a lack of human data and contradictory findings hampered conclusions&quot;. Another study has found that drinking vegetable juice reduces risks of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by 76%.

However, the British Nutrition Foundation holds that although vegetable juice counts as a serving, it can only count as one serving, regardless of the amount of juice drunk. Additionally, A 2007 Japanese study showed that although Japanese commercial juices had nutritional benefits, they were insufficient as a primary mode of vegetable consumption.

Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetables such as beets also contain large amounts of sugar, so care must be taken when adding these to juices.

Consumption of certain vegetable juices can also contribute substantially to oxalate intake; people who form calcium oxalate stones may be advised to limit consumption of vegetable juices. Cases of oxalate nephropathy associated with oxalate-rich juice intake have also been documented in susceptible individuals.

Although the actual nutritional benefits of vegetable juice are contested, a 2008 UC Davis study found that drinking vegetable juice daily significantly increased drinkers&#x27; chances of meeting the daily recommended number of vegetable servings. Having an easy source of vegetables encouraged drinkers to incorporate more vegetables into their diets. Children who refuse whole vegetables may find vegetable juice, when blended with fruit juice, a palatable alternative.

<doc id="1125980" wikidata="Q3268080" url="?curid=1125980" title="USS Caiman">
<text>USS &quot;Caiman&quot; (SS-323), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy that was later transferred to the Turkish Naval Forces in 1972 under the Security Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned as the third TCG &quot;Dumlupınar&quot;. She was retired in 1986.

==Career (US)==

Originally &quot;Blanquillo&quot;, the vessel was renamed on 24 September 1942 after the caiman, a fresh water alligator inhabiting the Amazon River, and launched on 30 March 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. R. C. Bonjour; commissioned 17 July 1944. She reported to the Pacific Fleet.

During World War II, &quot;Caiman&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 13 November 1944. Pausing at Saipan to put ashore her severely ill commanding officer and embark his relief, the submarine pushed on to the South China Sea, where she combined offensive patrol with lifeguard duty as a part of air-sea rescue operations to save aviators downed in air strikes on enemy-held territory. Aggressive American submarine and naval air attack had already greatly reduced the Japanese merchant fleet; hence &quot;Caiman&quot; made no contacts on this patrol, from which she returned to Fremantle, Australia, on 22 January 1945 to refit.

Her second patrol, performed in the South China Sea and off the Gulf of Siam, from 18 February to 6 April, also yielded no contacts, but on her third, which began at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 28 April, she sank two small schooners. Their use illustrated graphically the almost complete loss of modern merchant ships which the Japanese had suffered largely at the hands of the U.S. Navy.

Returning to Fremantle 27 June from her patrol area off southern Indo-China and western Borneo, the submarine refitted for her fourth war patrol, during which she performed three dangerous special missions, landing and later evacuating agents from the coast of Java. On this patrol, which took place from 22 July to the end of hostilities, she sank another Japanese schooner. She returned to Subic Bay 19 August, then sailed for the West Coast.

Post-World War II, &quot;Caiman&quot; operated out of San Diego, Guam, and Pearl Harbor in 1946. In 1947 she made an Arctic familiarization cruise out of Seattle as part of Operation Blue Nose. Thereafter, based on Seattle, she served as reserve training ship until 23 April 1951, when she began a GUPPY conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Since then based at Pearl Harbor and San Diego, &quot;Caiman&quot; has alternated local operations and fleet exercises with tours of duty in the Far East at 18-month intervals. On her 1957 cruise, Brisbane, Australia, was added to her more usual itinerary of Japanese and Philippine ports.

==Career (Turkey)==

&quot;Caiman&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Register, and transferred to Turkey on 30 June 1972 under the terms of the Security Assistance Program. She arrived on 23 August 1972 to the Naval Yards in Gölcük and was commissioned the following day as the third TCG &quot;Dumlupınar&quot; (S-339) - an important name in Turkish history, and the name of the final and defining battle of the Turkish War of Independence.

Four years after Turkey took over ex-&quot;Caiman&quot;, she suffered a collision with Soviet freighter &quot;Szik Vovilov&quot; in the Dardanelles on 31 August 1976. Luckily, her crew was able to ground the submarine on a nearby bank, thus preventing the tragedy that befell the previous TCG &quot;Dumlupinar&quot; in 1953, the wreck site of which lay just away. TCG &quot;Dumlupinar&quot; was subsequently salvaged, repaired, and continued to serve in the Turkish Navy for 11 years before she was decommissioned and renamed &quot;Ceryan Botu&quot; (Y-1247) on 6 February 1983, under which name she served as a charging boat at Gölcük Navy Yards until she was permanently retired on 15 September 1986.

<text>The following is a list of United States Army and United States Marine Corps divisions of World War II.
The United States began the war with only a handful of active divisions: five infantry and one cavalry. By the end of the war, the nation had fielded nearly one hundred. The number of divisions fielded by the United States Army in relation to the population and industrial capacity of the country and in comparison to the number of divisions fielded by various other Allied and Axis countries, has been called &quot;the 90-Division Gamble&quot;. Due to the US Army&#x27;s method of employment combined with events of the war, the United States did not suffer the destruction of any of its division-size units during the conflict, except for the Philippine Division in 1942. 

Some divisions were &quot;constituted&quot; (placed on the rolls of the Army and contemplated for organization) but never activated, and &quot;phantom&quot; units were also &quot;raised&quot; on paper during the war to confuse the Germans.

==United States Army Divisions==

The 82nd Airborne Division was originally the 82nd Infantry Division of the Organized Reserve, and after being ordered into active military service on 25 March 1942, was converted to an airborne division on 15 August 1942. The 101st Infantry Division was disbanded in the Organized Reserve on 15 August 1942, and was concurrently reconstituted and activated as an airborne division on the same date.

The 15th Airborne Division was constituted, but never activated. It was dropped from the mobilization program in 1943.

===Airborne Divisions===
===Armored Divisions===

The 19th Armored Division was constituted, but never activated. It was dropped from the mobilization program in 1943.

===Cavalry Divisions===
===Infantry Divisions===
==== 1st to 25th ====

Infantry divisions were initially titled with their numerical designation and &quot;division&quot; (e.g., &quot;1st Division&quot;). In August 1941, the War Department issued a statement that divisions&#x27; names were to represent their major arm of service (i.e., armored, cavalry, or infantry) to avoid confusion as several divisions of different arms now shared the same number. Some divisions issued general orders introducing &quot;infantry&quot; as an official part of their names, but this change was not added to the table of organization of the infantry division, which technically controlled its naming conventions, until 1 August 1942.

The 1st through 25th Infantry Divisions, excepting the 10th Mountain Division, were raised in the Regular Army or the Army of the United States prior to American involvement in World War II. Because of funding cuts, in September 1921, the 4th through 9th Infantry Divisions were mostly inactivated. Within a few years, the headquarters of the 1st and 3rd Infantry Divisions &quot;almost ceased to exist. Only the division commander and a few staff officers remained to carry out minimal division administrative functions, and neither division exercised true command functions over their units.&quot; The 2nd Infantry Division remained the most functional stateside division, as it was concentrated entirely at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. By the mid-1920s, most of the divisions&#x27; inactive units were staffed with Organized Reserve officers as &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; units.

The Hawaiian Division, &quot;which was the closest thing to a full-strength division in the interwar American Army.&quot; was split on 1 October 1941 to create the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions. The 24th Infantry Division headquarters inherited the lineage of the Hawaiian Division&#x27;s headquarters, while the 25th Infantry Division was raised in the Army of the United States. 

The 10th Mountain Division was raised in the Army of the United States in 1943.

==== 26th to 45th ====

The 26th through 45th Divisions, with the exception of the 39th and 42nd Divisions, were raised in the National Guard during and after World War I. In postwar mobilization plans, the 26th through 45th Divisions, less two, were allotted to the National Guard. The 30th, 31st, and 39th Divisions had been organized in what would become the states of the Fourth Corps Area; the designations of the 30th and 39th Divisions were originally selected, with the 31st Division being deleted. In 1923, the adjutants general of the states concerned successfully requested that the War Department change the designation of the 39th Division to the 31st Division and adjust allotments of units accordingly. The 42nd Division was the second division deleted from the mobilization program as it had contained units from twenty-six states and the District of Columbia, although it would be reconstituted during the war as a division in the Army of the United States.

==== 63rd to 89th ====

After World War I, 33 infantry divisions (the 76th through 104th) were organized as part of the Organized Reserve. They were nominally regional organizations, drawing their officer cadre and a small, nearly insignificant, number of enlisted men from an allotted portion of a state, entire state, or multiple states, similar to National Guard units. Prior to American involvement in World War II, Organized Reserve officers were called to active duty individually and assigned to existing Regular Army and National Guard units. When the Organized Reserve units themselves were called to active duty beginning in 1942, &quot;few of the Reserve officers originally assigned to...units were available for duty with them. Consequently, the units as activated bore small resemblance to those of peacetime.&quot; 

The 61st, 62nd, 67th, 68th, and 72nd-74th Infantry Divisions were constituted, but never activated. They were dropped from the mobilization program in 1943.

==== 90th to 106th ====

The 105th and 107th Infantry Divisions were constituted, but never activated. They were intended as additional segregated African American divisions. They were dropped from the mobilization program in 1943.

<doc id="1126010" wikidata="Q1352190" url="?curid=1126010" title="Harold MacMichael">
<text>Sir Harold Alfred MacMichael (15 October 1882 – 19 September 1969) was a British colonial administrator who served as High Commissioner for Palestine.

==Early life and career==
Educated at Bedford School, MacMichael graduated with a first from Magdalene College, Cambridge. After passing his civil service exam, he entered the Sudan Political Service in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He then served in the Blue Nile Province until 1915, when he became a senior inspector of Khartoum Province. He rose to the position of civil secretary in 1926. In 1933, he became governor of Tanganyika until 1937.

==High Commissioner of Palestine==
The next year, he became High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1942, he was blamed for sending at least 768 Jewish refugees aboard MV &quot;Struma&quot; to their deaths. During his tenure, MacMichael was the target of seven unsuccessful assassination attempts, mainly by the Lehi Group (the Stern Gang). In the last, both he and his wife narrowly escaped death in an ambush that the Stern Gang had mounted on 8 August 1944, on the eve of his replacement as High Commissioner.

MacMichael also served a stint as High Commissioner of Malta.

==Malayan Union==
The British Military Administration had set to task of reviving pre-war plans for centralised control over the Malay states within days after British Allied forces landed in Singapore on 5 September 1945.

MacMichael, who had completed his stint as High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine, was empowered to sign official treaties with the Malay rulers over the Malayan Union proposal scheme. MacMichael made several visits to the Malay rulers, beginning with Sultan Ibrahim of Johor in October 1945. The Sultan quickly consented to MacMichael&#x27;s proposal scheme, which was motivated by his strong desire to visit England at the end of the year. MacMichael paid further visits to other Malay rulers over the proposal and sought their consent over the proposal scheme. Many Malay rulers expressed strong reluctance in signing the treaties with MacMichael, partly because they feared the loss of their royal status and the prospect of their states falling into Thai political influence.

It has to be mentioned that the Sultans signed under duress. The British were intent on securing their agreement and were willing to depose of any disagreeing Sultan if necessary. That all of the Malay Sultans signed with so little resistance can be attributed to a rather simple ploy by the British. They were privately told that if they resisted, an inquiry would be held into their relations, conduct and collaboration with the Japanese occupation during the war. The sitting rulers, many of whom were concerned that both their offices and social positions would be destroyed, quickly complied. Later, when their positions were confirmed and secure, many would complain that they had not been given the opportunity to consult with their state councils nor with each other. In the words of the Sultan of Kedah, &quot;I was presented with a verbal ultimatum and a time limit, and in the event of my refusing to sign the new agreement... a successor who would sign would be appointed&quot;.

The treaties provided that the British had full administrative powers over the Malay states except in areas pertaining to Islamic customs. The Malays strongly protested the treaties, which had the effect of circumscribing the spiritual and moral authority of the Malay rulers over which the Malays held high esteem. Communal tensions between the Malays and the Chinese were high, and the prospect of granting citizenship to non-Malays was deemed unacceptable to the Malays.

Opposition to the Malayan Union and MacMichael&#x27;s perceived highhanded ways in getting the Malay rulers consent led to the birth of Malay nationalism in British Malaya.

==Family==
MacMichael&#x27;s daughter, Araminta, married the politician and business leader Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington. His other daughter, Priscilla, married James Raynes, a US Navy officer.

<text>The Shvetsov M-11 is a five-cylinder air-cooled radial aircraft engine produced in the Soviet Union between 1923 and 1952.

==Design and development==
The Shvetsov M-11 was designed under a 1923 competition in the Soviet Union for a new engine to power trainer aircraft. It is a single-row five-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine with aluminum cylinder heads. Like the American Kinner B-5 5-cylinder radial of similar size, the M-11 had individual camshafts for each cylinder, operating the pushrods, rather than a single central cam ring. The initial versions of the M-11 suffered from a short service life of only 50 hours. The basic M-11 engine had a power output of 100 hp (73 kW), the newer M-11D variant was higher at 125 hp (92 kW). The ultimate version, M-11FR, introduced in 1946, increased power output to 160 hp at 1,900 rpm on takeoff and 140 hp at cruise and had provisions for a variable-pitch propeller, accessory drive (for vacuum pumps, compressors, generators, etc.) and featured a floatless carburetor.

==Applications==
The M-11 powered a number of Soviet, Bulgarian and Polish aircraft. The M-11 remained in production until 1952 with an estimated total of over 100,000 engines made. Several hundreds of M-11D and M-11FR-1 variants were manufactured under license in the Polish WSK-Kalisz works in Kalisz. It was also used for the up-engined GAZ-98K aerosani winter-used sled in a pusher configuration, and as the standard powerplant for the similar NKL-26 propeller-driven sledges during the World War II years.

<doc id="1126020" wikidata="Q7505677" url="?curid=1126020" title="Shutterspeed">
<text>Shutterspeed were an Australian independent rock band which formed in Brisbane in 1998. They were fronted by Andrew Petersen on lead vocals and guitar, and released two albums, &quot;Hill Street Views&quot; (September 2001) and &quot;Custom Made Hit Parade&quot; (June 2003) before disbanding in 2004. They had high rotation radio airplay for their singles, &quot;Good Little Monkey&quot; (July 2001), &quot;Come Out Swingin&#x27;&quot; (December 2002) and &quot;Under Control&quot; (April 2003). Their live performances established a reputation for passionate, energetic and unpredictable shows, with the band creating exciting soul-infused rock; they often played long sets, throwing impromptu snippets of cover versions into their own songs. The line-up from their second album, &quot;Custom Made Hit Parade&quot; (June 2003), toured New Zealand in late 2003.

By mid-2004 the band had split, with guitarist Anthony Dettori and keyboardist Morgan Wilson forming The Newtown Jets and bass guitarist Dan Alder joining Shifter. Petersen, with drummer Scott Lapthorne and new bass player Matt Kafoa, continued as a three-piece Shutterspeed, recording the &quot;Turn to Black&quot; (2004) EP. Petersen and Kafoa relocated to the United Kingdom in mid-2005, playing as My Scarlet Darling with drummer Darren Lee and, following Kafoa&#x27;s departure, bassist Wayne Myers. In late 2006 Petersen returned to Australia and in 2009 released a solo album, &quot;The Universe and Its Sense of Humour&quot;.

<text>Andy Francisco Herron Aguilar (born February 2, 1978) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer who played as a forward.

==Club career==
Before joining the Chicago Fire in late in 2004, Herron played two years with Costa Rican Herediano, which he led to Costa Rica&#x27;s 2004&#x27;s title, by leading the Costa Rican clausura&#x27;s tournament with 14 goals and 13 assists. He had joined Herediano after he left Santos de Guápiles in December 2002. Herron had his best season for Chicago in 2006, when the 2006 Budweiser/Fire Golden Boot winner proved his productivity for the &quot;Men in Red&quot; by scoring eight goals in 20 games, with 18 starts. Herron put the team on his shoulders in the team&#x27;s 2006 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup championship run, scoring four goals and one assist through the competition. His assist and game-winning goal against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Final at Toyota Park helped the Fire clinch an MLS club-record fourth title to the trophy case.

After two and a half seasons in Chicago, he decided to get back to Club Sport Herediano on a loan from Chicago, but soon after that was sent to Columbus for the second pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft (which turned out to be Bakary Soumare) and forward Ryan Coiner. In the MLS Reserve Division he started and played one game for the Crew Reserves, notching one goal in 79 minutes of play.

In February 2008, Herron left Puntarenas and re-signed with Chicago Fire. On November 26, 2008, he was waived by Chicago and he returned to Herediano for the 2009 Verano season. In January 2010 he joined Ramonense and in June 2010 he moved to Guatemala to play for USAC. In summer 2011 he returned to his hometown club after 13 years.

He returned to the United States in January 2012 when he signed with Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League. In summer 2013 he left Fort Lauderdale to join Atlanta Silverbacks, but left them in August 2013 without any game played for them.

He is now the Concacaf Scout for the Chicago Fire FC.

===Controversy===
On January 11, 2006, Herron was suspended for six games without pay for his behavior that led to a red card in a 1–0 loss to the New England Revolution during the Eastern Conference Championship game the previous November 6. According to the MLS Soccer Disciplinary Committee, Herron was disciplined for making &quot;unacceptable physical contact&quot; with the referee Terry Vaughn and assistant referee George Gansner, conduct that led to him being sent off in stoppage time.

On April 19, 2007, Herron elbowed New England&#x27;s Jay Heaps in a nationally televised game. The on-field officials did not see the action. Major League Soccer suspended Herron for four games and fined $3,000.

==International career==
Herron made his debut for Costa Rica in a November 2002 friendly match against Ecuador, also recording his first international goal, and earned a total of 25 caps, scoring 7 goals. He represented his country in 9 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 2003 UNCAF Nations Cup and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Being an unmovable striker in Jorge Luis Pinto&#x27;s squad and scoring the goal which took Costa Rica to the quarterfinals in the 2004 Copa América held in Chile. He tallied 11 goals in eight games with the Costa Rican U-23 squad during Olympic Qualifying from 1999–2000.

His final international was an August 2009 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Honduras.

==Personal life==
Herron has three children. He grew up playing in the streets of Puerto Limón, Costa Rica. He is a big basketball and Chicago Bulls fan.

He lives in Florida with his family.

<text>General Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope (1 March 1874 – 14 September 1947) was a British soldier and colonial administrator.

==Military career==
Educated at Repton School, Wauchope was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1893. He transferred to the 2nd Battalion Black Watch in January 1896.

He served in the Second Boer War in South Africa from 1899, and took part in operations in Cape Colony, south of Orange River. British forces advancing north from the Cape to relieve the town of Kimberley, which was sieged by Boer forces, met heavy resistance in the Battle of Magersfontein on 11 December 1899. Wauchope was severely wounded in the battle, and was later mentioned in despatches and appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services.

In April 1902 he was seconded for a Staff appointment, as an extra Aide de camp to Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Cape Colony.

He served in World War I as Commanding Officer of 2 Bn Black Watch in France and Mesopotamia. After the War he joined 2nd Silesian Brigade, part of the British Upper Silesian Force, in Germany. He became Military Member of an Overseas Delegation to Australia and New Zealand in 1923 and then Chief of the British Section of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control for Berlin in 1924. He was appointed General Officer Commanding 44th (Home Counties) Division in 1927 and GOC Northern Ireland District in 1929. He was promoted to lieutenant general in May 1931.

His last appointment was as High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief for Palestine and Trans-Jordan in 1931. Wauchope&#x27;s administration was generally sympathetic to Zionist aspirations. By 1941 the former chief immigration officer for the Mandate, Albert Montefiore Hyamson, could write in his book &quot;&quot; that &quot;the first four years of his [Wauchope&#x27;s] term were the heyday of Zionist history in Palestine.&quot; Not only did immigration go up threefold (the Jewish population increased from 174,606 to 329,358), but Jews also increased their land holdings (in 1931 they increased their land holdings by 18,585 dunams or 4,646 acres, while in 1935 they increased them by 72,905), and finally Jewish business and commerce enjoyed an economic boom. He also promoted public works and civil engineering schemes but was regarded as lax by some of his political colleagues at the early stages of the Arab rebellion. However, Wauchope oversaw mass detention throughout the revolt and sought to impose &quot;collective punishment&quot; on Palestinian cities and towns. This culminated in the June 1936 demolition of the Old City of Jaffa which rendered 6,000 Palestinians homeless. Wauchope retired in 1938.

<text>Club Sport Herediano (), commonly known as Herediano and nicknamed El Team, is a Costa Rican multisport club based in Heredia, Heredia province. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Herediano is best known for its football team. It plays in the Primera División de Costa Rica, the top tier of the Costa Rican football league system. Herediano are one of two clubs to have never been relegated.

Herediano has its origins in 1918. The framework for &quot;Asociación Deportiva Club Sport Herediano&quot; was simmering since June 1920, with the appointment of an interim board with iconic figures like Manuel Joaquín Gutiérrez, Eladio Rosabal, Víctor Manuel Ruiz, Claudio Arguedas and Luis Valerio, but it was not until June 12, 1921 that the Herediano Charter was signed. In that same year, Eladio Rosabal Cordero became the first manager of the Costa Rica national football team, and Herediano player Manuel Joaquín Gutiérrez became the first scorer of the national team.

The club&#x27;s first season resulted in Herediano winning the national championship in 1921, the first edition of Costa Rica&#x27;s top-flight league. Herediano established itself as a major force in Costa Rican football by winning 28 First Division titles through 2019.

&quot;El Team&quot; plays its home matches at the Estadio Eladio Rosabal Cordero. Herediano&#x27;s home kit is composed of red and yellow vertical striped shirts, with red shorts, accompanied by yellow and red socks. This combination has been used since 1929. Pirma are the kit manufacturers. Herediano holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably against Alajuelense, Saprissa and Cartaginés. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Costa Rica&#x27;s FIFA World Cup squads such as Marvin Obando, Germán Chavarría, Claudio Jara, Mauricio Wright, Paulo Wanchope, David Myrie, Óscar Granados, José Miguel Cubero, and Daniel Cambronero.

==History==
In 1918, Heredians sought to form a football club that would represent their province. Three local Heredian football clubs, Club Sport Renacimiento, Club Sport Juan J. Flores, and Club Sport Cristóbal Colón incorporated themselves to form Club Sport Herediano. Native Heredian football players such as José Joaquín &quot;Toquita&quot; Gutiérrez, Eladio Rosabal Cordero, Víctor Manuel Ruiz, Gilberto and Claudio Arguedas, and Luis Valerio (who all played in various clubs such as La Libertad and Gimnástica Española) united to sign the official constitution of CS Herediano in June 1921. On July 1, 1921, the first official action that CS Herediano took was to purchase land to create a football field. In the same year, CS Herediano began to pressure the Costa Rican government to form a local FA, and thus in 1921 the Federación Costarricense de Fútbol was formed and the first national championship was scheduled—which CS Herediano would win.

In 1925, CS Herediano embarked on its first international match when it had a six-game tour in Jamaica in which they won four, tied and lost one. In 1928 CS Herediano travelled to El Salvador to play several international matches against local clubs. They beat Cuscatlán twice, once by a score of 11–0 and then again 11–1. They also beat FAS in Santa Ana 4–0, and beat Sonsonate 8–0. The club&#x27;s most historic victory came in 1932 in Costa Rica&#x27;s National Stadium in La Sabana, when CS Herediano beat the Argentina National team 3–1. In its first decade of existence CS Herediano won 6 national titles, four of them consecutively. CS Herediano is considered the Costa Rican club team with the most international experience. They also won the 1988 &quot;Copa Camel&quot;, beating in the process Mexican teams like Puebla and UAG Tecos on American soil. Recently, CS Herediano, also known as &quot;Los Florenses&quot;, have ended a championship drought of 19 years (going back to the 1992–93 season) by winning the Verano 2012 tournament, in a brilliant display of attacking and offensive play in the final part of the season. After that, thousands of Herediano&#x27;s fans celebrated the victory in the streets, displaying what some people now estimate is the biggest football celebration in the country&#x27;s history. In those years 19 previous years, Costa Rica saw only four teams win the championship, Saprissa, Alajuelense, Liberia Mia, and Brujas. To CS Herediano&#x27;s credit they were consistently at the finals, but victory seemed to escape their grasp. In the 2005–06 season, CS Herediano unveiled a new official team logo of a tiger grasping the letters CSH. Although this was supposed become the new image for the team, the original logo remained as the official shield of the team&#x27;s uniform.

On May 19, 2012, Herediano put an end to a drought of titles by winning the 22nd against Santos de Guápiles with an aggregate score of 6–3.

However, despite this, Herediano were suffering severe financial trouble that was until American businessman David J. Patey who was working and residing in Costa Rica decided to form a consortium with his brothers (Mike and Mark) to purchase the club on October 30, 2012..

==Estadio Eladio Rosabal Cordero==
The construction of a stadium in the city of Heredia began on December 22, 1945, under the direction of Rafael Herrera Feluco (Drunk).

The Municipal Council of the Canton Central played a key role in donating two plots for this purpose to Club Sport Herediano, albeit with a number of conditions: the work must be completed within a five-year-period, providing the stage for other county’s sporting events, and above all, the club cannot sell the property within a period of 99 years from the execution of the deed of sale and can only be mortgaged to invest these funds in the construction or maintenance of the property.

The construction of the stadium was managed by a loan from the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica, as well as inputs from the community, local organizations and the government of the Republic of Costa Rica itself.

The inaugural date is August 21, 1949, in which Herediano played its first match against the Gimnástica Española, with a score of 3–1. However, it has been discussed the opening day due to lack of a paper record that references this inaugural match to be considered the official opening game.

In 1964 the former manager Vicente Montero made a motion for the stadium to be named Eladio Rosabal Cordero. Thus, by the end of the decade of the 1960s the stadium was officially baptized under that name.

The stadium’s lighting was installed that same year, and in 1974 broadcasting booths were finished. In the late seventies the south-sector-grandstand was built.

In early 2010, the grass was replaced by latest generation of synthetic turf with dimensions of 105.80 meters long and 68 meters wide.

At present, the stadium has a capacity for 8,144 spectators, and it is owned by the Asociacion Deportiva Club Sport Herediano. Bleachers are divided into: Sol General, Sol Numerado, Sombra Numerada and Palcos.

==Kit==
The first uniform was bought at the Tomas Salazar´s Central Market stand, thanks to an economical contribution of Joaquín &quot;Toquita&quot; Gutierrez. The purchase was made for a dozen shirts, similar to the worn by the military in time of the Federico Tinoco government. Wearing a greyish jersey combined with white short pants; that is how Herediano showed to its first official championship match against Liga Deportiva Alajuelense – which was indeed, their first winning game-.

The distinctive usage of red and yellow as the club´s colors began in 1926, when the Club Fortuna de Cuba visited Costa Rican soil for the second time in history. The manager of the Cuban team was interested in setting up a match with Herediano, but had the drawback that Herediano did not have a proper uniform for that kind of international events. The solution was found in the New Century Warehouse owned by Ramón Herrero, who had imported red-and-yellow-striped uniforms to be used by the Spanish Gymnastic Society team. At the end, the Hispanic team did not purchase them and once again Joaquín Gutiérrez made a deal to get the uniforms, which eventually became the emblematic jersey for the club.

The red and yellow colors were added in the statutes by a reform in 1929, which stated that official uniform is a vertical red/yellow striped shirt combined with black shorts and stockings. This provision remained for seventy years, until this was excluded from the current statutes. Herediano wore a sponsorship in its shirt for the first time in 1978, when the brand Toshiba was stamped on his chest.

Robert Lionel Fanthorpe (born 9 February 1935) is a retired British priest and entertainer. Fanthorpe also worked as a dental technician, journalist, teacher, television presenter, author and lecturer. Born in Dereham in Norfolk, he lives in Cardiff in South Wales, where he served as Director of Media Studies and tutor/lecturer in Religious Studies at the Cardiff Academy Sixth form college.

== Biography ==
Lionel Fanthorpe was educated at Barnard Castle School and Hamond&#x27;s Grammar School in Swaffham. He left school aged 15 and married Patricia Alice Tooke (born 1938) in 1957. For a period he worked as a journalist on the &quot;Norfolk Chronicle&quot; and then as a van driver and warehouseman at Hamerton&#x27;s Stores in Dereham, taking his A-levels by private study at home and by correspondence courses. He attended the teacher-training course at Keswick Hall College in Norwich between 1961 and 1963, where he achieved Distinctions in Educational Theory and Practice and in Advanced Main Theology as part of his Certificate in Education.

Fanthorpe was a schoolmaster at Dereham Secondary Modern School from 1958 to 1961 and again from 1963 to 1967, and a Further Education Tutor based at Gamlingay Village College from 1967 to 1969. He was Industrial Training Manager for the Phoenix Timber Group of Companies in Rainham from 1969 to 1972, Head of English and then Deputy Headteacher at Hellesdon High School near Norwich from 1972 to 1979, and Headmaster of Glyn Derw High School in Cardiff from 1979 to 1989. He has a BA in Arts &amp; Social Sciences from the Open University. He was ordained as a non-stipendiary Anglican priest in the Church in Wales in 1987, is also a minister of the Universal Life Church, and was also at one time a Freemason in Bowers Lodge in Norwich.

He is the author or co-author of more than 250 books. He has been president of the British UFO Research Association and is the president of the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena. He presented Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Fortean TV&quot; and has made many appearances at &quot;Fortean Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s UnCon, most recently in October 2004 when he gave a talk on &quot;The Knights Templar and their Ancient Secrets&quot;. He is a Fellow of the College of Preceptors and the Chartered Management Institute.

He is a member of the high IQ society Mensa and the paranormal research society the Ghost Club. In addition, Fanthorpe is a Dan Grade martial arts instructor and a weight-training instructor. He has been a frequent guest of the late night American radio talk show Coast to Coast AM.

Fanthorpe was Director of Media Studies and teacher of Religious Studies at the Sixth form college the Cardiff Academy in Cardiff in South Wales. In 2013 he appeared in the Yesterday series &quot;Forbidden History&quot; presented by Jamie Theakston.

==Family life==
Fanthorpe&#x27;s wife Patricia is also his agent, manager and business partner. Moreover, they co-authored a number of books, including &quot;Rennes-le-Chateau: Its Mysteries and Secrets&quot; (1991), &quot;The Oak Island Mystery: The Secret of the World&#x27;s Greatest Treasure Hunt&quot; (1995), &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Mysterious People (Mysteries and Secrets)&quot; (1998), &quot;Mysteries of Templar Treasure and the Holy Grail: The Secrets of Rennes Le Chateau&quot; (2004), &quot;Mysteries and Secrets of the Templars: The Story Behind the Da Vinci Code&quot; (2005), &quot;Mysteries and Secrets of the Masons: The Story Behind the Masonic Order&quot; (2006), &quot;Satanism &amp; Demonology: Mysteries and Secrets&quot; (2011), &quot;The Joan of Arc Mysteries&quot; (2019), &quot;Garan of the Veneti&quot; (2019), &quot;Parables of the Pond&quot; (2019), &quot;Earth, Sky and Sea&quot; (2019) and &quot;Thoughts and Prayers for Stressful Times&quot; (2019).

Today, the couple live in Roath in Cardiff. They have two daughters, Stephanie Dawn Patricia Fanthorpe (born 1964), and Fiona Mary Patricia Alcibiadette Fanthorpe (born 1966).

==Television, radio and film appearances==

===Television===
===Radio===
Lionel Fanthorpe wrote and narrated several episodes of &quot;The Fanthorpe Investigations&quot; for BBC Radio (Sounds).

== Writing ==
Fanthorpe&#x27;s output can be grouped under three broad headings, as follows:
* Approximately 180 paperback novels and short-story collections, in the science fiction and supernatural genres, produced for the UK publisher Badger Books during the 1950s and 1960s.
* Numerous books on Christian themes, including the &quot;Thoughts and Prayers&quot; series.
* Compilations of Forteana (generally with the word &quot;mystery&quot;, &quot;mysteries&quot; or &quot;mysterious&quot; in the title), co-written with his wife Patricia.

=== Badger Books ===
Fanthorpe began working for Badger Books in the early 1950s, and over the period of the next 15 years produced many books under different pseudonyms, some of which were pen-names shared with other of Badger Books&#x27; writers. These included: Victor La Salle, John E. Muller, and Karl Zeigfreid. Pseudonyms exclusive to Fanthorpe&#x27;s short story output include Neil Balfort, Othello Baron, Noel Bertram, Oben Leterth, Elton T. Neef, Peter O&#x27;Flinn, René Rolant, Robin Tate, and Deutero Spartacus. Names he used for novels include Erle Barton, Lee Barton, Thornton Bell, Leo Brett, Bron Fane, L.P. Kenton, Phil Nobel, Lionel Roberts, Neil Thanet, Trebor Thorpe, Pel Torro, and Olaf Trent.
Using several of these pen names, he would often even write the entire contents of a pulp magazine such as &quot;Supernatural Stories&quot;.

The exact number of books and stories Fanthorpe wrote for Badger Books is not known, but is estimated to be in excess of 180, 89 of which were written in a three-year period – an average of a 158-page book every 12 days.

During his time at Badger Books, Fanthorpe was essentially a small cog in a large publishing machine. The way the company worked was to acquire the cover art &quot;before&quot; the book was written, and send it to the author who then had to write a story about the cover. In some cases, Badger Books re-used cover art that had been produced to illustrate completely different novels. For example, Fanthorpe&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; was written to suit a cover that had been produced to illustrate John Brunner&#x27;s &quot;Slavers of Space&quot;, which formed one-half of Ace double D-421.

Although generally based on situations and plots familiar from pulp fiction, the novels and stories also used academic and pseudo-academic facts to fill out their background, including the mythology of Ancient Egypt (&quot;The Eye of Karnak&quot;), Babylon (&quot;Unknown Destiny&quot;), India (&quot;Vengeance of Siva&quot;) and Greece (&quot;Negative Minus&quot;).

The stories also demonstrate the author&#x27;s interest in Fortean subjects, such as vimanas (&quot;The Negative Ones&quot;), Chase Vault and the Devil&#x27;s Footprints (&quot;U.F.O. 517&quot;), the disappearances of Benjamin Bathurst (&quot;Time Echo&quot;) and the crew of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; (&quot;Barrier 346&quot;), as well as the career of Charles Fort himself (&quot;The X-Machine&quot;). Another novel that discusses Charles Fort explicitly (both in the text and in the back-cover blurb) is &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. This latter novel has no connection with the famous film of the same title, but instead describes a vast interstellar chess game played by superhuman entities using human beings as pawns.

Other novels are pastiches of accepted works of the Western Canon – &quot;Beyond the Void&quot; is a loose rewrite of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and in &quot;Negative Minus&quot; the characters Suessydo and Epolenep re-enact Homeric tales.

=== Wordcatcher Publishing ===
As of 2019, Lionel and his wife began writing for Wordcatcher Publishing, a publishing house based in Cardiff, Wales. So far, under this partnership, they have released the historical fiction titles &quot;The Joan of Arc Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Garan of the Veneti&quot;, in addition to multiple books in the &#x27;Thoughts and Prayers&#x27; series. Alongside these are a collection of poems, &quot;Earth, Sea and Sky&quot;, plus a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Parables of the Pond&quot;, the latter of which was published under the Auxillium Press imprint.

<doc id="1126046" wikidata="Q8069139" url="?curid=1126046" title="Zenker's fixative">
<text>Zenker&#x27;s fixative is a rapid-acting fixative for animal tissues. It is employed to prepare specimens of animal or vegetable tissues for microscopic study. It provides excellent fixation of nuclear chromatin, connective tissue fibers and some cytoplasmic features, but does not preserve delicate cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Helly&#x27;s fixative is preferable for traditional dye staining of mitochondria. Zenker&#x27;s fixative permeabilises the plasma, but not the nuclear membrane. It can therefore be used to selectively stain mitotic cells (where the nuclear membrane has dissolved) with antibodies against chromatin

Zenker&#x27;s fixative contains mercuric chloride (&quot;corrosive sublimate&quot;), potassium dichromate, sodium sulfate, water, and acetic acid. Fixatives containing mercuric chloride or potassium dichromate are toxic, making disposal as hazardous waste costly. Mercuric chloride can be replaced with the same weight of less toxic zinc chloride, but the resulting &quot;zinc-Zenker&quot; may not give the same quality of fixation as the original mixture.

This fixative is named after Konrad Zenker, a German histologist, who died in 1894 (Baker 1958).

==Stock solution==
Zenker is usually made with 50g of mercuric chloride, 25g of potassium dichromate, 10g of sodium sulfate (decahydrate) and distilled water to complete 1000 ml.

Before use, 5 ml glacial acetic acid is added to 100 ml of the solution. Both the stock solution and the complete Zenker fixative are stable for many years.

===Helly&#x27;s fixative===
If the glacial acetic acid is replaced by 5 ml of formalin (37–40% formaldehyde), the resulting solution is Helly&#x27;s fixative, also sometimes called &quot;formol-Zenker&quot;. Helly is stable for only a few hours because the formaldehyde and dichromate components react, producing formic acid and chromium(III) ions; the orange solution becomes greenish.

<text>ADC Telecommunications, Inc. was a communications company in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a southwest suburb of Minneapolis. It was acquired by TE Connectivity (Tyco Electronics) in December 2010 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. ADC products were sold by CommScope after it acquired the Broadband Network Solutions business unit (including ADC) from TE Connectivity in August 2015.

==History==

ADC Telecommunications was founded in 1935 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by Ralph Allison and Walter Lehnert.

During their first year in business, ADC built hearing aids and audiometers—a machine used for evaluating hearing acuity. Initially the audiometers were built for Maico, but in 1945 ADC began building audiometers under its own name. Additionally, by 1942, the company had designed a sophisticated audio system for the University of Minnesota, and the resulting jacks, plugs, patch cords and jackfields became the cornerstones for ADC&#x27;s later entry into telecommunications.

In 1949, ADC sold its audiometer product line and Ralph Allison left the company to form a new business in California. With Walter Lehnert remaining as president of the company, ADC diversified and focused its efforts in the area of transformers and filters for power lines, military electronics, telephone jacks and plugs.

In 1961, ADC merged with Magnetic Controls Company, a manufacturer of power supplies and magnetic amplifiers with strong ties to the U.S. space program. The resulting company, ADC Magnetic Controls, had a decade of mixed success. Although transformer sales boomed during the 1960s, other new product initiatives failed to materialize. Perhaps the most significant product innovation during this period was the bantam jack, a miniaturized component that eventually became the standard for telephone circuit access and patching. Building on its growing sales of jacks and plugs in the early 1970s, ADC introduced prewired, connectorized jackfields, wired assemblies and test equipment for telephone operating companies. By 1974 the company was on solid ground, and by 1976, ADC had become the largest independent supplier of test boards in the United States.
ADC grew in 1983, when AT&amp;T was ordered to deregulate by the federal government. By establishing the seven Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) carriers as independent entities, the U.S. market for telecommunications expanded by 90 percent. ADC became a supplier for the RBOCs.

ADC embarked on some acquisitions in the early 1990s, attempting to move &quot;up the stack&quot; in the datacom field by acquiring companies that manufactured datacom equipment. However, their ability to find synergies between these companies proved limited and eventually ADC was forced to move away from a hardware-only strategy, broadening out into software. This effort resulted in limited success as well, and happening about the same time as the dot-com bubble burst, caused ADC stock to plummet.

ADC acquired PairGain Technologies Inc. for 1.6 billion USD in stocks in 2000.

ADC Telecommunications was acquired by Tyco Electronics in July 2010 for a reported $12.75 per share in cash, or an enterprise value of approximately $1.25 billion.

The acquisition of ADC by TE Connectivity was completed on December 9, 2010 

On January 28, 2015, it was publicly announced that the boards of directors of both TE Connectivity and CommScope agreed for CommScope to purchase the Broadband Network Solutions business unit of TE Connectivity in an all-cash deal for US$3.0 billion. The former ADC is a part of this business unit. The purchase of the Broadband Network Solutions business was closed on Aug 31. 2015

==Corporate acquisitions==
The company acquired Telinq in 1990. In 1993, ADC acquired Fibermux Corp., a manufacturer of LAN Hubs and Data Multiplexers, later merging the Fibermux division with the Kentrox subsidiary. ADC sold Kentrox to the private equity firm Platinum Equity, LLC in 2001. ADC also acquired American Lightwave Systems, a manufacturer of uncompressed video transport equipment for telecom carriers. This division was later sold to C-COR Electronics.

In 1996, ADCT merged with ITS (Information Transmission Systems) but has since sold it off.

In May 1997, ADC Telecommunications signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Apex Group Inc., for approximately $26 million.

In 1999, the company acquired Saville. A year later, in May 2000, ADC purchased the Swedish-based company Altitun.

ADC acquired KRONE, a supplier of copper and fiber-based connectivity products and services, in 2004.

In 2005, ADC acquired Fiber Optic Network Solutions (FONS) to expand its FTTX offerings and OpenCell to enhance its wireless coverage and capacity offerings.

G-Connect was acquired by ADC Technologies in 2006 for an undisclosed amount.

In 2007 ADC acquired LGC Wireless to expand its portfolio of wireless coverage and capacity products and services. In 2008, ADC expanded its market presence and manufacturing capacity in China with the acquisition of Century Man Communications.

==Businesses==
ADC&#x27;s customers were served regionally by businesses focused on telecommunications, wireless, cable, and enterprise networks. Business units within ADC developing products and services included Global Connectivity Solutions, Network Solutions and Professional Services.

<doc id="1126058" wikidata="Q3645095" url="?curid=1126058" title="British UFO Research Association">
<text>The British UFO Research Association or BUFORA is a UK organisation, formerly registered as &quot;BUFORA Ltd&quot;, dedicated to investigating UFO phenomena in the British Isles. In 1997 the organisation was reported to have around 1,000 members.

==History==
In 1991, the book &quot;UFO Encyclopedia&quot; was compiled for the group by Major Sir Patrick Wall.

==Status==
BUFORA investigates over 400 cases a year, with the organisation reporting 95% of them as hoaxes. They run witness support groups for those who believe they have encountered extra terrestrials. The organisation has held an annual conference at Sheffield Hallam University since 1987 and hold meetings across the country; with Rendlesham Forest being a frequent spot for gatherings. They have been outspoken critics of the UK government&#x27;s Freedom of Information Act as it relates to UFOs.

==Controversy==
An entry in the &quot;UFO Encyclopedia&quot;, which was a sighting confirmed as genuine by BUFORA, was later found to be a hoax. The supposed contactee, who claimed to have seen a UFO hovering over the town of Warminster, admitted to the hoax in 1994. In 1995, the group were the only official UFO organisation to endorse a film, purportedly by the US government, showing an alien autopsy at Roswell.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Robert Chancellor (20 October 1870 – 31 July 1952) was a British soldier and colonial administrator.

==Biography==
Chancellor was the younger son of Edward Chancellor, of Woodhall House, Juniper Green, Midlothian, and Anne Helen Tod (d. 1932), daughter of John Robert Tod, WS. The Chancellor family had held the lands of Shieldhill, Quothquan from 1432.

He attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and after graduation was commissioned into the British Army&#x27;s Corps of Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 25 July 1890. Promoted to lieutenant on 25 July 1893, he took part in the 1896 Dongola Expedition under Sir Herbert Kitchener, and served in the 1897–98 Tirah campaign on the North West Frontier of British India as part of the Sirmoor Imperial Service Snappers. For his service in India he was mentioned in despatches, received the India Medal, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1898. He was promoted to captain on 20 May 1901, and later served as Secretary of the Colonial Defence Committee.

After a career in the Royal Engineers he became a colonial administrator serving as the 20th Governor of Mauritius from 13 September 1911 to 28 January 1916, Trinidad and Tobago (1916–1921) and Southern Rhodesia (1923–1928). He also served as Principal Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence From 1922 to 1923.

In 1898 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In 1909 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was knighted in the 1913 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours when he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). In the 1922 Dissolution Honours List he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). He was appointed a Knight of Justice in the Venerable Order of Saint John on 19 December 1928.

==High Commissioner of Palestine==

In 1928, he became High Commissioner of the British Mandate of Palestine, where he was perceived as being cool to Zionism and the Jewish people. Though he admired some Zionist leaders, in particular Pinhas Rutenberg, in general Chancellor&#x27;s attitude towards Jews was negative. He wrote to his son that &quot;truly the Jews are an ungrateful race&quot;. His attitude towards Arabs was politically supportive but paternalistic; he wrote to his son: &quot;they are like children, and very difficult to help&quot;.

While he was in London in 1929, riots broke out in Jerusalem stemming from Muslims protesting Jews&#x27; use of the Western Wall. On his return, he initially condemned Arab attacks but was subsequently less critical. He helped write Lord Passfield&#x27;s White Paper of 1930, which aimed to reinterpret the Balfour Declaration. He left Palestine in 1931.

In 1931, Jerusalem&#x27;s Straus Street was renamed Chancellor Avenue in his honour. The street reverted to its original name after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

In 1937 he was appointed chairman of the Livestock Commission, which was set up following the passing of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937. In the 1947 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours he was created a Knight Grand Cross in the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for services to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.

== Family ==
In 1903, Chancellor married Mary Elizabeth Howard (1881–1976), daughter of George Rodie Thompson, DL, JP, of Lynwood, Ascot, Berkshire. They had three children: Christopher John Howard Chancellor (1904–1989), who married Sylvia Mary Paget in 1926; Robert Duff (Robin) Chancellor (1921-2010); and a daughter, Elizabeth Rosemary Alice Chancellor (1906–1971), known as Rosemary, who married Air Chief Marshall William Elliot in 1931. Christopher and Sylvia had four children: John Paget Chancellor, Teresa Chancellor (Married Peter Gatacre then John Wells), Susanna Maria Chancellor (married Nicholas Johnston) and Alexander Chancellor; Rosemary and William also had two children: Louise Elliot (Halsey) and Simon Elliot.

== Legacy ==
Chancellor Avenue in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, now Harare, Zimbabwe, was named after him and still bears his name. However, his grandson, Alexander Chancellor, suggested that it be changed on account of it now being the street on which Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe lived.

<text>Alden Partridge (February 12, 1785 – January 17, 1854) was an American author, legislator, officer, surveyor, an early superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and a controversial pioneer in U.S. military education, emphasizing physical fitness training, advocating the concept of citizen soldier and establishing a series of private military academies throughout the country, including Norwich University.

==Early life==
Alden Partridge was born and raised on a family farm in Norwich, Vermont, the son of Elizabeth (Wright) Partridge and soldier Samuel Partridge Jr., who had fought in the American Revolutionary War, including the Battles of Saratoga. Tall and hardy, the younger Partridge hiked the Green and White Mountains, worked on his father&#x27;s farm, and matriculated in local district schools. He attended Dartmouth College from 1802 to 1805.

==Military career==
Upon his graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1806, Partridge received the rank of lieutenant of engineers and an appointment at the academy as an assistant professor of mathematics. In its early days, the post served both as the academy for training prospective officers and the headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the superintendent was also chief of engineers. In 1808 chief engineer Jonathan Williams promoted Partridge to professor of mathematics and delegated to him the responsibilities of acting superintendent. Partridge set an example for physical fitness during his administration, frequently leading the cadet corps on extended marches in New York and neighboring states. Never profane or intemperate, superintendent Partridge required cadets to attend church services, occasionally preparing and delivering the sermon on Sundays. Named professor of engineers in 1813, and officially appointed as superintendent in 1814, &quot;Old Pewt&quot; developed a reputation among academy faculty as a martinet, often micromanaging subordinates, and occasionally demonstrating preference toward favorite cadets.

The &quot;Long Gray Line&quot; tradition at West Point originated during Partridge&#x27;s tenure when he had gray uniforms made in New York City in 1814 because of a shortage of blue cloth. In 1816, when the War Department decided to select a new Cadet uniform, gray was chosen because &quot;it better suits the finance of the Cadets than one of blue.&quot; In other words, gray uniforms were cheaper.

Partridge refused to relinquish his command when former student (but superior officer) Sylvanus Thayer was appointed to replace him as superintendent and was court-martialed for insubordination and neglect of duty. Though acquitted of serious wrongdoing, he chose to resign his commission in 1818, after having served his entire Army career at the academy. He received a pension for his service at West Point during the War of 1812, and after his death his wife received a pension as the widow of an 1812 veteran.

==Citizen soldier==
In the summer of 1818 Partridge was engaged in New York City to drill and instruct a volunteer infantry company, and he gave a series of lectures on the subjects of military science, fortifications, and military education. In these lectures, Partridge advocated a new program of regional military instruction and began a lifelong campaign in opposition to the existing national military academy system which would shape the rest of his life. Partridge argued that the national academies produced a professional officer class, and was creating a new military elite, which was at odds with examples of the country&#x27;s great generals, such as George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Partridge proposed the nation be divided into state-based military departments, local citizen soldiers organized into militias and officers appointed by department, and units mustered on a regular basis for instruction and drill, much like the Minutemen of the well-remembered American Revolution. Further, he suggested military colleges for officer instruction be established in each department.

Partridge was appointed chief of the surveying expedition to establish boundaries between the U.S. and Canada as required under the Treaty of Ghent. He mapped the natural watersheds of the Saint Lawrence River and Hudson River. Still consumed with plans for a military college based on his program, he decided to resign from the expedition in 1820, and retired to Norwich.

==Private military educator==
===Norwich University===
In 1819, Partridge founded the &quot;American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy&quot; in Norwich, Vermont (now known as Norwich University and located in Northfield, Vermont). Norwich is the nation&#x27;s oldest private military college, based on Partridge&#x27;s model of training citizen soldiers, it became the basis for the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). In its first four years, the nascent academy was attended by 480 students representing 21 of the 24 states, and Partridge&#x27;s program seemed successful enough to attract the attention of Middletown, Connecticut, which undertook a financial subscription of local residents as an inducement to relocate his academy. Partridge moved the school, and in Middletown, it drew nearly 1,200 students in three years, but the academy was operating again in Norwich by 1829.

===Curriculum===
The curriculum Partridge advanced incorporated the study of liberal arts, agriculture, modern languages, and engineering in addition to the sciences and various military subjects. Field exercises and drills, for which Partridge borrowed cannon and muskets from the federal and state governments, supplemented classroom instruction and added an element of realism to the college&#x27;s program of well-rounded military education.

One of America&#x27;s first exercise enthusiasts, Partridge became a strong proponent of physical education as an essential part of school curriculum. As part of that program, he often led his classes on hiking expeditions in the many local mountains of New England. On one climb of Vermont&#x27;s Green Mountains in 1822, Partridge led 27 pack-laden cadets on a 150-mile hike from Norwich to Manchester in just four days.

===Other colleges===
Awarded an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth in 1812, Partridge received the same honor from the University of Vermont in 1821, but he declined that institution&#x27;s offer the same year to become its president.

Partridge founded 17 military institutions during his quest to reform the fledgling United States military, including: The American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Middletown, Connecticut (1824-1831), the Virginia Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Portsmouth (1839–1846), Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol (1842–1845), Pennsylvania Military Institute at Harrisburg (1845–1848), Wilmington Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Wilmington (1846–1848), the Scientific and Military Collegiate Institute at Reading, Pennsylvania (1850–1854), Gymnasium and Military Institute at Pembroke, New Hampshire (1850–1853) the National Scientific and Military Academy at Brandywine Springs, Delaware (1853).

When John Thomas Lewis Preston worked to influence public opinion in favor of creating the Virginia Military Institute in the 1830s, Partridge assisted by providing open letters of support to members of the Virginia General Assembly and letters to the editors of Virginia newspapers.

==Efforts to revitalize militia==
Interested in revitalizing and reforming the state militias, which had become increasingly dormant during the long period of peace following the War of 1812, Partridge and Norwich University faculty members Truman B. Ransom and Alonzo Jackman, both of whom served in the militia, worked with Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, also a militia officer, and Frederic Williams Hopkins of the Vermont militia on efforts to increase recruiting and improve training and readiness.

==Personal life==
An avid hiker, Partridge is described as &quot;a noted pedestrian&quot; in &quot;A History of Norwich&quot;. He had reportedly already ascended Mount Monadnock and Mount Moosilauke in New Hampshire when in 1818 he walked 76 miles from Norwich to climb both Camel&#x27;s Hump and Mount Mansfield in two days. It rained the entire journey, according to his journal, and while one friend joined him climbing Mansfield, he hiked the balance of the expedition accompanied only by his &quot;inseparable companions&quot;, his knapsack and barometer. He was an early traveler on a path to the summit of Mount Washington, New Hampshire that had been constructed in 1821 by the pioneering Ethan Crawford.

A Democrat, Partridge served as Vermont&#x27;s Surveyor General from 1822 to 1823. He also served four terms in the Vermont House of Representatives, (1833, 1834, 1837 and 1839). In addition, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives on five occasions between 1834 and 1840, losing each time to Whig party candidate Horace Everett.

==Family==
In 1837, Partridge married Ann Swasey (1810-1902), with whom he had two sons, George M. C. Partridge (1838-1855) and Henry V. Partridge (1839-1920). His widow did not remarry, and survived him by 48 years.

In 1823 Partridge adopted a young Greek boy, George Colvocoresses, whom he raised and educated at Norwich University. Colvocoresses, NU Class of 1831, was appointed to the United States Navy in 1832; from 1838 to 1842 he served in the United States Exploring Expedition, better known as the Wilkes Expedition of the Pacific Ocean. Three separate geographical features, two on the west coast of the U.S. and another in Antarctica, were named for Colvocoresses.

==Death and burial==
Partridge died in Norwich on January 17, 1854. He was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Norwich.

==Works==
Partridge wrote widely, mostly in local newspapers and in books, about his many travels, several mathematical and scientific subjects, and his constant, vocal opposition to the academy at West Point. The following is an incomplete list of his writings.

<doc id="1126068" wikidata="Q962600" url="?curid=1126068" title="Willamette Meteorite">
<text>The Willamette Meteorite, officially named Willamette and originally known as Tomanowos by the Clackamas Chinook Native American tribe, is an iron-nickel meteorite found in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the largest meteorite found in the United States and the sixth largest in the world. There was no impact crater at the discovery site; researchers believe the meteorite landed in what is now Canada or Montana, and was transported as a glacial erratic to the Willamette Valley during the Missoula Floods at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). It has long been held sacred by indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley, including the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (CTGR).

The meteorite is on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which acquired it in 1906. Having been seen by an estimated 40 million people over the years, and given its striking appearance, it is among the most famous meteorites. In 2005, the CTGR sued to have the meteorite returned to their control, ultimately reaching an agreement that gave the tribe access to the meteorite while allowing the museum to keep it as long as they are exhibiting it.

==Physical characteristics and formation==

The Willamette Meteorite weighs about . It is classified as a type III iron meteorite, being composed of over 91% iron and 7.62% nickel, with traces of cobalt and phosphorus. The approximate dimensions of the meteorite are tall by wide by deep. Most iron meteorites like Willamette have originated from the differentiated core of planetesimals or asteroids that collided with another object. Willamette has a recrystallized structure with only traces of a medium Widmanstätten pattern; the result of a significant impact-heating event on the parent body. The Willamette Meteorite contains higher concentrations of various metals that are quite rare in Earth&#x27;s crust. For example, iridium, one of the least abundant elements in Earth&#x27;s crust, is found in the Willamette Meteorite at a concentration of 4.7 ppm, thousands of times more concentrated than in the crust.
==Emplacement and erosion==

The lack of an impact crater at the discovery site was only explained after the 1920s, with the new understanding about the Missoula Floods, one of the largest floods documented. These floods were caused by the collapse of an ice barrier during the last deglaciation. 

The meteorite presumably landed on an ice cap in what is now Montana or western Canada, and was dragged by the glacier ice to the vicinity of an ice barrier that formed across the Clark Fork River. This barrier had ponded a huge amount of water at Lake Missoula right at the time when the meteorite reached the area and the ice barrier became unstable and breached. The resulting flood involved up to per second of water discharge, with large blocks of ice rafting down the Columbia River and the Willamette Valley at the end of the last Ice Age (~13,000 years ago). Some of these ice rafts included boulders (known as &#x27;glacial erratic&#x27; by geologists) like the Willamette meteorite, which eventually sank in the flood waters and settled where they were found by humans.

The deep crevasses of the meteorite resulted from both its high-speed atmospheric entry and its subsequent weathering. Exposed to the elements for thousands of years, rainwater interacted with the mineral troilite, resulting in a form of sulfuric acid which slowly dissolved portions of the meteorite. This resulted in the gradual development of the hollows that are visible today.

==Modern history==
In 1902, Ellis Hughes was the first European settler to recognize the meteorite&#x27;s significance. At that time, the land was owned by the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. Hughes attempted to claim ownership of the meteorite, and secretly moved it to his own land. This involved 90 days of hard work to cover the distance. The move was discovered, and after a lawsuit, the Oregon Supreme Court held that Oregon Iron and Steel Company was the legal owner.
In 1905, Sarah Tappan Hoadley, wife of William E. Dodge Jr., purchased the meteorite for $26,000 . After displaying it at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, she donated it to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it has been on display since 1906.

In 1998, museum curators cut a section from the crown of the meteorite. That section was traded to a private collector for a piece of a Martian meteorite.

In 1999, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (CTGR), a confederation of Native American tribes, demanded that it be returned and filed an action pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) against the American Museum of Natural History. In response, the Museum filed a federal lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment against the CTGR in 2000. An agreement with the Museum was reached later that year in which the meteorite would remain at the museum with tribal members being able to conduct a private ceremony around the meteorite once a year, and that ownership will be transferred to CTGR should the museum cease to have the meteorite on display.

In 2006, a , piece of the meteorite, derived from the above noted crown section, was purchased at auction and was displayed at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, until it was returned to the CTGR on February 22, 2019.

In early 2007, in response to a student&#x27;s request, Representative John Lim introduced a resolution that would demand that the museum return the meteorite to Oregon. The tribes said they were not consulted, they did not support the resolution, and were content with the current arrangement with the museum.

In October 2007, plans to auction the crown section led to claims by the CTGR of insensitivity. Bidders dropped out when an editorial in the Portland &quot;Oregonian&quot; newspaper asserted the CTGR would file a lawsuit against the new owner, but the CTGR disavowed the editorial and said they had no such intent, and that they could not stop the sale. While the newspaper printed an apology, the specimen was withdrawn. A lawsuit was filed against the newspaper in Oregon Circuit Court and failed.

==Mass==
Different sources report different weights of the Willamette Meteorite, ranging from to . Circa 2008, pages of the American Museum of Natural History website stated both &quot;15.5 tons&quot; and &quot;14 tons&quot;. There are differences between the metric ton (), short ton (), and long ton (), each of which may simply be called a &quot;ton&quot;. In 1906, the American Museum of Natural History stated that the weight of the meteorite was &quot;at least 31,200 pounds, or about 15.6 tons&quot;, consistent with American usage of &quot;ton&quot; usually meaning the short ton. , the American Museum of Natural History website gives the weight as &quot;15.5 tons&quot;.

==Replicas==
An inexact replica, known as &quot;Brown and Black Asteroid&quot;, is on display in Eugene, Oregon, outside the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History on the University of Oregon campus.

A one-fifth-size replica stands in Fields Bridge Park in West Linn, Oregon.

The only exact replica of the meteorite was created circa 2018 by Garrick Imatani, an artist and assistant professor at Southern Oregon University, through a process involving photogrammetry of the original at the American Museum of Natural History, via cooperation with the CTGR, and 3D printing. Imatani also created an interpretation of the meteorite that is on permanent display at the University of Oregon in Straub Hall.

<doc id="1126070" wikidata="Q336040" url="?curid=1126070" title="Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer">
<text>Field Marshal Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932) was a senior British Army officer who fought in the First World War, being perhaps most notable for commanding the Second Army of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front from 1915 to 1918.

==Early life and education==
Herbert Plumer was son of Hall Plumer of Malpas Lodge, Torquay, Devon (a grandson of Sir Thomas Plumer), and Louisa Alice, daughter of Henry Turnley, of Kensington. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Plumer was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 65th Regiment of Foot on 11 September 1876. He joined his regiment in India and became adjutant of his battalion on 29 April 1879.

Promoted to captain on 29 May 1882, he accompanied his battalion to the Sudan in 1884 as part of the Nile Expedition. Plumer was present at the battle of El Teb in February 1884 and the battle of Tamai in March, and was mentioned in dispatches. He spent from 1886 to 1887 attending the Staff College at Camberley, England, before being appointed deputy assistant adjutant general in Jersey on 7 May 1890.

He was promoted to major on 22 January 1893 and posted to the 2nd Battalion the York and Lancaster Regiment before being appointed assistant military secretary to the General Officer Commanding Cape Colony in December 1895. He went to Southern Rhodesia in 1896 to disarm the local police force following the Jameson Raid and then later that year returned there to command the Matabele Relief Force during the Second Matabele War. He became deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot with promotion to brevet lieutenant colonel on 8 May 1897.

In 1899 Plumer returned to Southern Rhodesia where he raised a force of mounted infantry and, having been promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 17 October 1900, he led them at the Relief of Mafeking during the Second Boer War. He was promoted to colonel on 29 November 1900 and was then given command of a mixed force which captured General Christiaan de Wet&#x27;s wagon train at Hamelfontein in February 1901.

Plumer arrived back in the United Kingdom in April 1902, and two months later was received in audience by King Edward VII on his return. In a despatch dated 23 June 1902, Major General Lord Kitchener, Commander-in-Chief in South Africa during the latter part of the war, wrote how Plumer had &quot;invariable displayed military qualifications of a very high order. Few officers have rendered better service.&quot; He was promoted to major general for distinguished service in the field on 22 August 1902, and was appointed Commander of the 4th Brigade within 1st Army Corps on 1 October 1902. The following year he became General Officer Commanding 10th Division within IV Army Corps and General Officer Commanding Eastern District in December 1903. He became Quartermaster-General to the Forces in February 1904, General Officer Commanding 7th Division in April 1906 and General Officer Commanding 5th Division within Irish Command in May 1907. Promoted to lieutenant general on 4 November 1908, he went on to be General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for Northern Command in November 1911.

In addition to his military duties, he served as the Commissioner for London Boy Scouts from 1910 to 1912.

==First World War==
Following the unexpected death of Lieutenant General Sir James Grierson on his arrival in France in 1914, Plumer was considered for command of one of two corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) alongside the GOC I Corps, Lieutenant General Douglas Haig: this position eventually went to General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien. Plumer was sent to France in February 1915 and given command of V Corps which he led at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915.

He succeeded Smith-Dorrien in command of the Second Army of the BEF in May and, having been promoted to full general on 11 June 1915, and having been largely unemployed during the battles of the previous two years, he won an overwhelming victory over the Imperial German Army at the Battle of Messines in June 1917. The battle started with the simultaneous explosion of a series of mines placed by the Royal Engineers&#x27; tunnelling companies beneath German lines. The detonation created large craters and was described as the &quot;loudest explosion in human history&quot;. After the mines were fired, Plumer&#x27;s men left their trenches and advanced 3,000 yards. He won further victories at the battle of the Menin Road Ridge and the battle of Polygon Wood in September 1917 and the battle of Broodseinde in October 1917 advancing another 5,000 yards in the process.

In November 1917 Plumer, who in August had been made colonel of the York and Lancaster Regiment, was given command of the Italian Expeditionary Force sent to the Italian Front after the disaster at Caporetto. Early in 1918, Plumer was sought by Lloyd George for the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff as a replacement for General Sir William Robertson: he declined the position.

Plumer instead commanded the Second Army during the final stages of the war, during the German spring offensive and the Allied Hundred Days Offensive.

==Later career==
Plumer was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the British Army of the Rhine in December 1918 and Governor of Malta in May 1919. He was promoted to field marshal on 31 July 1919, and was created Baron Plumer of Messines and of Bilton on 18 October 1919.

In August 1925 he was appointed High Commissioner of the British Mandate for Palestine. He resisted Arab pressure to reverse commitments made by the British Government in the Balfour Declaration, and dealt firmly with both the Zionists and the Arab Nationalists. On one occasion, an Arab delegation protested a proposal by Jewish battalions to install their regimental colours in the chief synagogues, saying they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be responsible for the consequences&quot;. Plumer replied, &#x27;That&#x27;s all right, you&#x27;re not asked to be responsible for the consequences. I&#x27;ll be responsible.&quot; In Mandatory Palestine Plumer gained a reputation as being &quot;genuinely even handed&quot; and was one of the few British administrators who was consistently popular with both the Jewish community and the Arab community in that territory. Privately, he was sympathetic to the cause of establishing a homeland for the Jewish people but he tried his best to &quot;be fair&quot; to Arab concerns as well while he was High Commissioner.

On 24 July 1927 he conducted the inauguration ceremony for the Menin Gate memorial at Ypres in Belgium. 

Plumer, placed on half-pay in November 1928, was created Viscount Plumer for his &quot;long and distinguished public services&quot; on 3 June 1929.

==Death==
Plumer died at his home in Knightsbridge in London on 16 July 1932 at the age of 75. His body was interred in Westminster Abbey.

==Family==
In July 1884 Plumer married Annie Constance Goss (1858–1941), daughter of George and Eleanor Goss; they had three daughters and one son. Their youngest daughter, Marjorie, married Maj. W.H. Brooke who had studied at University College, Oxford and was a chief mourner at the Leeds funeral of Robert Middleton in October 1912.

<text>Beop (died 600) (r. 599–600) was the 29th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of King Hye. He reigned as Baekje power declined, having lost the Seoul region to the rival Silla kingdom.

He may have chosen his name, which translates as &quot;law king&quot; or &quot;dharma king&quot;, to emphasize his identification with the Buddhist faith. 

Beop&#x27;s brief reign is mostly remembered for his ban on all killing, including hunting and butchering. He ordered the release of falcons and the burning of fishing and hunting tools. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, this ban was established in the twelfth lunar month of 599.

He began construction on the Wangheungsa temple, which was completed late in his successor&#x27;s reign.

* Father: Hye of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Half-sister: Princess Wu Yeong (, ?–?)

<text>Paul R.A. De Giberne Sieveking (born 1949) is a British journalist and former magazine editor.

Until 2002, Sieveking was co-editor of the magazine &quot;The Fortean Times&quot; with its founder Bob Rickard. He joined the UK-based &quot;Journal of the Unexplained&quot; in 1978. His father, Lancelot &quot;Lance&quot; De Giberne Sieveking was an early BBC radio and television drama pioneer, and his half-brother Gale De Giberne Sieveking was an archaeologist.

==Biography==
Sieveking was born in London in 1949, the son of writer/broadcaster/producer Lance Sieveking. He attended Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read anthropology, graduating in 1971.

He subsequently produced the first English translation (with John Fullerton) of Raoul Vaneigem&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot;, which was published by Practical Paradise Publications in 1975.

==&quot;Fortean Times&quot;==
Sieveking was introduced to &quot;FT&quot;-founder Bob Rickard by mutual friend Ion Will in 1978, some five years and more than 25 issues after it was first self-published as &quot;The News&quot; in 1973, before becoming &quot;Fortean Times&quot; in 1976. Joining the team as co-associate editor (with Steve Moore) under Rickard. He took over full editorial duties for the four quarterly issues of 1984-1985 (#43-46), to give Rickard a chance to &quot;revitalize&quot;, (which he did). Sieveking then joined Rickard as co-editor for the next 16–17 years, until editorship was passed to David Sutton in 2002.

Sieveking was the Strange Days news editor until the end of 2019, but still plays a major role for &quot;FT&quot;, writing the Archaeology column, compiling the Extra Extra section, and editing the Letters pages. He also acts as quality-control proof-reader and contributes occasional feature articles.

==Other==

Whilst an undergraduate at Cambridge, Sieveking co-edited with the artist Antony Gormley the little magazine &quot;Origo 3&quot; (circa 1970, sole edition), which featured some of the artist&#x27;s first published work. Sieveking has produced occasional articles for online magazine NthPosition, and is described by them as having &quot;been a student of extreme human behaviour since the glory days of the Situationists.&quot;

<text>The Tlingit clans of Southeast Alaska, in the United States, are one of the Indigenous cultures within Alaska. The Tlingit people also live in the Northwest Interior of British Columbia, Canada, and in the southern Yukon Territory. There are two main Tlingit lineages or moieties within Alaska, which are subdivided into a number of clans and houses.

== Tlingit moieties ==

The Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska have multiple moieties (otherwise known as descent groups) in their society, each of which is divided into a number of clans. Each clan has its own history, songs, and totems, and each forms a social network of extended families which functions as a political unit in Tlingit society.

The moieties of the Tlingit society are the Raven (&quot;Yéil&quot;) and Eagle, Wolf, killer whale, Frog, Thunderbird and hummingbird and butterfly. The similarity to moiety names are because its primary crests differ between the north and the south regions of Tlingit territory, probably due to influence from the neighboring tribes of Haida, Tsimshian and Nisga&#x27;a. Each moiety is further subdivided into clans, and each clan is subdivided into houses.

==Clan names, crests and political structure==
The Tlingit clans have names whose meaning typically reflects the foundation story of the clan. The clans are usually referred to in English by the name of their primary crest, such as &quot;Deisheetaan&quot; being called &quot;Beaver Clan&quot;. This is not accurate since some crests may be held by multiple clans. Clans of opposite moieties occasionally claim the same crest, but such irregular ownership is usually due to a debt owed by some other clan; until the debt is paid, the clan holding the debt claims the crest of the clan which owes the debt, as a means of shaming it.

Clan allegiance is governed through a matrilineal system; children are born &quot;to&quot; the mother&#x27;s clan and gain their status within her family, including what was traditionally hereditary leadership positions. The parents are required to be from differing clans and be opposite moieties; the children are born from the father, but he has a lesser role in their rearing than does the mother&#x27;s brothers.

Not all clans listed below are extant; some have been absorbed into other clans; others have died out due to the lack of female descendants, and a few have been lost to history. Not all the clans are independent, since clans formed in a long and fluid process. For instance, the Kak&#x27;weidí descend from the Deisheetaan. Some members claim that they are a &quot;house&quot; within the Deisheetaan clan; others claim that they are a small but fully independent clan.

== List of clans ==
In the list below the Tlingit name of the clan is given with its primary crest in parentheses, followed by the various kwáan (region or village) in which they are found. Known houses are listed beneath each clan.

<doc id="1126086" wikidata="Q8017198" url="?curid=1126086" title="William R. Corliss">
<text>William Roger Corliss (August 28, 1926 – July 8, 2011) was an American physicist and writer who was known for his interest in collecting data regarding anomalous phenomena (including cryptozoology, out-of-place artifacts and unidentified flying objects). Corliss was Charles Fort&#x27;s most direct successor. Arthur C. Clarke described Corliss as &quot;Fort&#x27;s latter-day - and much more scientific - successor.&quot;

==Biography==

Starting in 1974, Corliss published a number of works in the &quot;Sourcebook Project&quot;. Each volume was devoted to a scientific field (archeology, astronomy, geology, et cetera) and featured articles culled almost exclusively from scientific journals. Corliss was inspired by Charles Fort, who decades earlier also collected reports of unusual phenomena.

Many of the articles in Corliss&#x27;s works were earlier mentioned in Charles Fort&#x27;s works. Unlike Fort, known for his idiosyncratic writing style, Corliss initially offered little in the way of his own opinions or editorial comments, preferring to let the articles speak for themselves. Corliss quoted all relevant parts of articles (often reprinting entire articles or stories, including illustrations). In some of his later &quot;Sourcebook&quot; efforts, such as the mid-1990s &quot;Biological Anomalies&quot; series, Corliss added his evaluation of both the reliability of the claims, and their ranking as anomalies. Well-documented reports from credible sources are ranked as a &quot;1&quot; while entirely unsubstantiated reports are rated as a &quot;4&quot;, with &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; representing intermediate reports. Similarly, Corliss&#x27;s uses a rating of &quot;1&quot; for anomalies that cannot be explained by existing scientific theories, while a &quot;4&quot; describes phenomena that are unusual but do not challenge scientific theories. 

Corliss wrote many other books and articles, notably including 13 educational books about astronomy, outer space and space travel for NASA and a similar number for the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Science Foundation.

==Reception==

In his book &quot;Unexplained!&quot;, Jerome Clark describes Corliss as &quot;essentially conservative in outlook&quot;. He explains, &quot;Corliss [is] more interested in unusual weather, ball lighting, geophysical oddities, extraordinary mirages, and the like — in short, anomalies that, while important in their own right, are far less likely to outrage mainstream scientists than those that delighted Fort, such as UFOs, monstrous creatures, or other sorts of extraordinary events and entities.&quot; 

Arthur C. Clarke said:

The meteorologist Charles A. Doswell has praised the research of Corliss, stating his documentation of anomalies was intriguing. However, the geologist Henry Faul has criticized Corliss. In a review for &quot;Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena&quot;, Faul noted:

In a review for a book that documented astronomical anomalies, the astronomer Joseph Veverka wrote that Corliss had shown negligence of the scientific literature for more than a decade and made incorrect statements. However, Richard Baum wrote a mostly positive review, stating that it was an objective work and &quot;his reviews are concise and well-referenced, and if on occasion his examples are questionable we do at least have the benefit of the bibliographies which will be useful to historians.&quot;

Science journalist Jeremy Cherfas in the &quot;New Scientist&quot;, suggested that Corliss&#x27; book &quot;Incredible Life&quot; had an agenda to challenge evolutionary theory as he believed that natural selection fails to explain biological mysteries. Science writer John Gribbin positively reviewed Corliss&#x27; book &quot;Unknown Earth&quot; in the &quot;New Scientist&quot;, stating it was a &quot;delightful mixture of established science, and the lunatic fringe... Where else can you get such entertainment at so little cost?&quot;.

<text>Allen High School is a public, co-educational secondary school in Allen, Texas (United States). It is the only high school in the Allen Independent School District.

Allen High School serves most of the city of Allen. Until fall 2006, when Lovejoy High School opened, Allen High School served high school students in the Lovejoy Independent School District, which includes the city of Lucas, most of Fairview, a portion of Parker and a small portion of Plano.

==History==
The first Allen High School, built in 1910 at the corner of Belmont and Cedar, was a two-story brick building housing six classrooms and an auditorium, and saw the first graduating class of eight students in 1914.

The second Allen High School was established in 1959 at the corner of Jupiter and Main Streets on land donated by Mr. Harris Brown.

In August 1999, Allen High School &quot;2000,&quot; a new facility at the corner of Greenville and Rivercrest, opened to 2,200 students in grades 10 through 12. The former high school was converted into the Becky Lowery Freshman Center, named in honor of a former middle school teacher and school counselor. In 2018, the building was partly demolished and replaced with a new building on an adjacent plot of land on Greenville Avenue. The southernmost part of the school was renovated into the Dillard Special Achievement Center, while the northern section became a parking lot. The football stadium still stands. The new building became the Freshman Center and started serving grade 9 students during the 2018–19 school year. It had an enrollment of 1,634 in 2015–16. A major expansion of the main high school campus was completed in 2011. This expansion included a new 1,500 seat performing arts center, an expansion of band hall space and a Career and Technology Education center featuring a student-managed restaurant open to the public, a student-managed apparel store with student-designed items, multiple new Mac labs, Mac-equipped rooms for the photojournalism, yearbook, commercial photography, audiovisual, radio, and newspaper classes as well as learning-classrooms for the medical education programs. The final expansion was completed in 2018. This expansion included an auxiliary gymnasium and an expanded fine arts hallway. This expansion also included renovations to the gymnasium, cafeteria, library and academic-hallways, which include &quot;huddle spaces&quot; for collaborative learning.

==Location==
*Freshman Center (9): 368 N Greenville Ave, Allen, TX 75002
*Main Campus (10–12): 300 Rivercrest Blvd. Allen, TX 75002
*CTE Campus (10-12) 1680 Ridgeview Dr, Allen, TX 75013

==Academics==

Allen High School offers the International Baccalaureate program to its students, with the class of 2002 being the first to graduate Full Diploma. AHS also provides Advanced Placement, Dual Credit, and elective courses. AP course enrollment at AHS is 52%.

Allen uses a modified block schedule, utilizing five standard periods per day. Tenth grade students are required to be present for four of these, while juniors and seniors are only required to attend three.

Allen High School was named a 2001–02 National Blue Ribbon School and a 2004 TEA Pathfinder School. For the 2021-2022 school year, the school was given an &quot;A&quot; by the Texas Education Agency.

== STEAM Center ==
Allen High School features a Career and Technical Education (CTE) campus known as the STEAM Center, which opened in 2019 at a cost of $40 million. The 111,000-square-foot facility supports various CTE programs for the high school, and hosts educational field trips for elementary and middle school students. The STEAM Center can accommodate over 500 students simultaneously and includes a range of advanced amenities, such as an OmniGlobe, a large maker space, and a lake. Additionally, it features a dedicated K-8 center specifically designed for field trip activities. The STEAM Center operates on a schedule separate and independent from the main high school campus. Dual credit courses, in partnership with Collin College, moved from the main campus on Rivercrest to the CTE campus upon opening.

== Enrollment ==
Allen High School is regarded as one of the largest high schools in the United States of America. As of February 2024, its enrollment is 6947, making it the largest public high school in the state of Texas.

During this time, the team won five state championships (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017), appeared in ten final fours (2003, 2006, 2008, 2012-2018), won 16 district titles in a row (2006-2021), and achieved a won-loss record of 234-28 from 2004 through 2022. Thirteen players from Allen have made their way to play professionally in the NFL.

==== Football stadium ====
Due to the program&#x27;s popularity and student population, the school was authorized, via an approved April 2009 referendum, to build an 18,000-seat stadium for the team. The stadium cost nearly $60 million, and opened for the 2012 football season. It is the fifth largest high school stadium in the state, but the largest designed for the use of only one team. The facility houses a weight room, wrestling practice facility, and indoor golfing facility.

<text>The 2002 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], announced on 26 January 2003, was the tenth of such countdowns of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J. As in previous years, a CD featuring 39 (not necessarily the top 39) songs was released. For the first time, a DVD, containing film clips of songs from the Hottest 100 was also released. This was also the last time that phone voting was allowed; in the 2003 poll, only internet voting was permitted. SMS voting was removed for the 2003 poll but was reinstated in the 2004 event

When the announcers got to the number one track, they announced that rapper Nelly&#x27;s song &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; had won the Hottest 100, after playing half of the song, they declared that it had been a joke, broke the CD on air, and began playing Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s &quot;No One Knows&quot;.

The band Salmon Hater came in at number 26 with their song &quot;6.66&quot; after Triple J morning show hosts Adam Spencer and Wil Anderson made an effort to rig the event, telling listeners to vote for the otherwise unlikely candidate.

<doc id="1126101" wikidata="Q2463224" url="?curid=1126101" title="Beatific vision">
<text>In Christian theology, the beatific vision () refers to the ultimate state of happiness that believers will experience when they see God face to face in heaven. It is the ultimate direct self-communication of God to the angel and person. A person or angel possessing the beatific vision reaches, as a member of the communion of saints, perfect salvation in its entirety, i.e., heaven. The notion of vision stresses the intellectual component of salvation, i.e., the immediate contemplation of God, though it encompasses the whole of the experience of joy, with happiness coming from seeing God finally face to face and not imperfectly through faith. (1 Cor 13:11–12).

It is related to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief in theosis, the Wesleyan notion of Christian perfection, and is seen in most church denominations as the reward for Christians in the afterlife.

In Islamic theology, those who die as believers and enter Jannah will be given the vision of Allah.

==Etymology==
&quot;Beatific&quot; is derived from the Latin past participle ‘&quot;beatificum&quot;’, made happy. &quot;Vision&quot; comes from the Latin noun ‘&quot;visio&quot;’, sight; so ‘&quot;beatifica visio&quot;’ is &#x27;a sight that makes one happy&#x27;.

==Judaism==
According to Rashi, the face of God is twofold: God&#x27;s care for Israel (&quot;And I will hide My face on that day, because of all the evil they have committed, when they turned to other deities.&quot;) and God&#x27;s essence (&quot;Then I will remove My hand, and you will see My back but My face shall not be seen.&quot;). 

According to rabbinic literature, all the prophets of the Tanakh (Old Testament) saw God dimly, as if through nine glass windows - save for Moses, who saw God clearly, as if through one glass window ((Yeb. 49b; Lev. R. i. 14)).

==Christianity==
===New Testament===
Jesus teaches that the pure of heart will see God (Matthew 5:8) and that children&#x27;s angels see the face of God the Father (Matthew 18:10). The Apostles teach that &quot;[f]or now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face” (1 Corinthians 13:12), that without holiness &quot;no one will see the Lord” (Hebrews 12:14), and that God&#x27;s people &quot;will see his face” (Revelation 22:4). 

===History===

In Christianity, the Bible states that God &quot;dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has even seen or can see&quot; (1 Timothy 6:16), but when God reveals himself to us in heaven we will then see him &quot;face to face&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:12). This concept has been termed &quot;the beatific vision of God&quot; by theologians of the Catholic Church and later on by various Protestant denominations, including the Lutheran Church and the Methodist Church.

Cyprian wrote of the saved&#x27;s seeing God in the Kingdom of Heaven.
How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, to be honored with sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with Christ your Lord and God... to delight in the joy of immortality in the Kingdom of Heaven with the righteous and God&#x27;s friends!

Edward A. Pace in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1907) defined the beatific vision:
The immediate knowledge of God which the angelic spirits and the souls of the just enjoy in Heaven. It is called &quot;vision&quot; to distinguish it from the mediate knowledge of God which the human mind may attain in the present life. And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds perfect happiness, the vision is termed &quot;beatific.&quot;

Methodist co-founder Charles Wesley, in his 1747 hymn &quot;Maker, in Whom We Live&quot;, described union with God through the Holy Spirit as &quot;beatific sight&quot;:
Spirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore / thy sacred energy, and bless thine heart-renewing power. / No angel tongues can tell thy love&#x27;s ecstatic height, / the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight.

===In the Catholic Church===

====Official teaching====
The church believes in the beatific vision because Jesus experienced it from conception to ascension, taught about it and promised it, and makes Catholics foretaste it by faith.

=====Ex Cathedra Statement In Benedictus Deus=====
Pope Benedict XII taught ex cathedra in the papal encyclical Benedictus Deus that the beatific vision happens immediately after death:
[I]mmediately after death...all the saints...have been, are and will be with Christ in heaven, in the heavenly kingdom and paradise, joined to the company of the holy angels...these souls have seen and see the divine essense with an intuitive vision and even face to face, without the mediation of any creature by way of object of vision; rather the divine essence immediately manifests itself to them, plainly, clearly and openly, and in this vision they enjoy the divine essence . Moreover, by this vision and enjoyment the souls...are truly blessed and have eternal life and rest...Such a vision and enjoyment of the divine essence do away with the acts of faith and hope in these souls, inasmuch as faith and hope are properly theological virtues. And after such intuitive and face-to-face vision and enjoyment has or will have begun for these souls, the same vision and enjoyment has continued and will continue without any interruption and without end until the last Judgment and from then on forever.

=====Roman Catechism=====
According to the Roman Catechism, the saints in heaven see God, whereby they share in God&#x27;s nature, wherewith they are truly and always happy. The catechism elaborates that the saints&#x27; happiness includes not just joy, but also glory (knowledge of one another&#x27;s dignity), honor (reverence for one another as adopted sons of God), and peace (fulfillment of all the heart&#x27;s desires). Moreover, the catechism adds, the beatific vision will, on Judgment Day, make the saints&#x27; resurrected bodies impassible (free from inconvenience, suffering, and death), bright as the angels, agile (free from the limitations of space-time), and subtle (as subject to the soul as the soul is subject to God).

=====Catechism of the Catholic Church=====
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the beatific vision is God opening himself in an inexhaustible way to the saints, so that they can see him face to face, and thereby share in his nature, and therefore enjoy eternal, definitive, supreme, perfect, and ever new happiness. The catechism teaches that this happiness includes not just communion and perfect life with the Trinity and the saints, but also the fulfillment of all the heart&#x27;s desires - including, on Judgment Day, the body being glorified, even endowed with impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtlety - and continual cooperation with God&#x27;s will - including praying for all other people, even proffering one&#x27;s merits to God for others&#x27; sake. The catechism elaborates that the beatific vision is a grace and a privilege intended for everyone to attain, and that the beatific vision is attained immediately after death – or after purgatory – yet it is already foretasted in baptism and in the eucharist. The catechism also teaches that the beatific vision is expressed in different ways in the New Testament: the kingdom of God, the vision of God, eternal life, divine adoption, a share in the divine nature, the joy of the Lord, and rest in God.

=====Description of the vision of God=====

======Doctrinal errors======
The church has condemned many doctrinal errors about the vision of God. As a result, it teaches that the beatific vision is not natural (like a feeling, thought, dream, idea, desire, or mental image), indirect (like an apparition, locution, voice of God, Tabor light, odor of sanctity, religious ecstasy, or some other private revelation), mediate (involving a mediator between God and oneself, like how people saw, heard, felt, and otherwise perceived Jesus&#x27; humanity during his lifetime, including after resurrection), relative (God being seen not as he is but as he is reflected in creation and in the saints), dark (God being seen not as he is but as inaccessible light coming from God), earned (God being seen not as he is but according to one&#x27;s merit), unsatisfactory (one not sharing in God&#x27;s happiness, which includes - but is not limited to - all of one&#x27;s wants and needs being fulfilled beyond superabundance), imperfect (one not sharing in God&#x27;s perfection, whereby one&#x27;s moral state is impeccable), or finite (one not sharing in God&#x27;s life, which is limitless and eternal).

======Nature of the vision of God======
The beatific vision is when God, though transcendent, opens himself up to people and angels, giving them the capacity to contemplate God in all His heavenly glory. Contemplation is the prayer of silently focusing on God and heeding His word; in other words, contemplation is the prayer of uniting with God.

======Sanctifying grace and the vision of God======
The beatific vision is ultimate union with God. It comes from sharing in God&#x27;s holy nature via sanctifying grace. 

======Effect of the vision of God======
Because God is life (fullness, beatitude, and perfection) itself, the beatific vision entails fullness of life (perfect friendship with Jesus and his angels and saints, including a share in Jesus&#x27; and the angels&#x27; and saints&#x27; own glories and honors) and ultimate beatitude and perfection (supreme definitive happiness, including immortality, i.e., freedom from Satan, temptation, sin, error, inconvenience, suffering, death, and every other evil). 

======Judgment Day and the vision of God======
On Judgment Day, the saints will experience the beatific vision with their bodies as well. Their bodies will be as deified as their souls. Deification entails:
* Impassibility (incorruptible / painless) – freedom from evil, i.e., temptation, sin, suffering, error, inconvenience, boredom, Satan, and death
* Subtility (permeability) – freedom from restraint by the laws of science, which includes shapeshifting, teleportation, time travel, control over nature, and superhuman senses and prowess
* Agility – one&#x27;s body will not act faster than one&#x27;s mind or give in to emotion and impulse, for the body will be as obedient to the soul as the soul is to God
* Clarity – resplendent beauty and the five crowns

======Recipients of the vision of God======
The beatific vision is a grace and a privilege intended for every person and angel, since God created people and angels to enjoy the beatific vision. The beatific vision is the ultimate purpose of each person&#x27;s and angel&#x27;s life.

======Jesus and the vision of God======
Because Jesus is considered God and man, His human nature experienced the beatific vision from conception to His ascension into heaven. Despite this, Jesus suffered, was crucified, and died as a human being.

====Unofficial teaching====

=====Thomas Aquinas=====
Thomas Aquinas defined the beatific vision as the human being&#x27;s &quot;final end&quot; in which one attains to a perfect happiness. Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one&#x27;s desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. &quot;Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek.&quot; But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect – and this is God. And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving Him. Consequently, the union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the ultimate goal of human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the &quot;light of glory&quot; so that we can see Him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes Psalm 36:9 on this point: &quot;In your light we shall see light.&quot;) Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;images&quot; of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself. The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God Himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God Himself and not with any created image of Him. This union comes about by a kind of &quot;seeing&quot; perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to Himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also His perfect goodness, this act of &quot;seeing&quot; is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.

According to Aquinas, the beatific vision surpasses both faith and reason. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind&#x27;s innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly.

The theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas states that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself.

Thus only the fullness of the beatific vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting Paul, Aquinas notes &quot;We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face&quot; (). Moreover, affirms that &quot;if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&quot;
The beatific vision is the final reward for those saints elected by God to partake in and &quot;enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself&quot; in the next life.

=====Pope John XXII and the beatific vision controversy=====

Pope John XXII (1316–1334) caused a controversy involving beatific vision, saying — not as Pope but as a private theologian — the saved do not attain the beatific vision until Judgment Day, a view more consistent with soul sleep. The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day. He never proclaimed his belief as doctrine but rather as an opinion (see &quot;ex cathedra&quot;, as defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870).

The Sacred College of Cardinals held a consistory on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John backed away from his novel views to the more standard understanding.

His successor, Pope Benedict XII, in the bull &quot;Benedictus Deus&quot;, taught that the saved see Heaven (and thus, God) before Judgement Day.

=====&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;=====
The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; defines the beatific vision as the immediate knowledge of God enjoyed by all the heavenly creatures. It explains that the vision of God is called &quot;beatific&quot; because by seeing God the mind finds perfect happiness, and called &quot;vision&quot; because the sight of God in heaven is not the same as mediate knowledge of God.

=====Private revelations=====
Saints who have seen or visited heaven do not mention the beatific vision. Instead, they sometimes give materialistic descriptions of heaven (garden, mansion, city, etc.) and sometimes give spiritual descriptions of heaven (joy, peace, lack of time, etc.).

==Islam==
According to the Quran, on Judgment Day &quot;some faces will be bright, looking at the Lord.&quot; (75:22-23) Ala-Maududi comments that some commentators &quot;have understood this allegorically,&quot; and that as for himself, he believes &quot;in the Hereafter the dwellers of Paradise will not see Allah in the specific form in which man sees something in the world, but their nature of seeing will be different, which we cannot comprehend here.&quot;

<doc id="1126107" wikidata="Q3030485" url="?curid=1126107" title="Disney Vacation Club">
<text>The Disney Vacation Club (DVC) is a vacation timeshare program owned and operated by Disney Vacation Development, Inc., a subsidiary of Disney Signature Experiences, a division of Disney Experiences, a segment of The Walt Disney Company. It allows buying a real estate interest in a DVC resort via a flexible points-based membership system. There are an estimated 220,000 club members.

==History==
The first Disney Vacation Club property, known as the Disney Vacation Club Resort (later renamed Disney&#x27;s Old Key West Resort in January 1996), opened on December 20, 1991 at Walt Disney World. In 1991, Disney had registered its time share plan with the state of Hawaii but did not establish an escrow agreement with Hawaii at the time of its creation. This allowed Disney to advertise its time share company in the state but did not allow for sales. On January 17, 1992, Disney Vacation Club was incorporated as Disney Vacation Development, Inc.

On March 30, 1993 Disney Vacation Development Inc announced plans for a 440-unit time-share resort south-east of Walt Disney World in Florida with ground breaking on July 28, 1994. This resort hotel, today known as Disney&#x27;s Vero Beach Resort, opened on October 1, 1995, as the Vacation Club Resort at Vero Beach, Florida. Disney would then open Disney&#x27;s Hilton Head Island Resort just five months later on March 1, 1996 in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.

Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom Villas opened its first phase in 2007 at $17,000 for a membership. By September 17, 2008, Disney Vacation Development had two new time share properties being built, Bay Lake Tower and Treehouse Villas in Orlando at existing Disney park hotels and both were to open in 2009. Bay Lake Tower&#x27;s timeshares were expected to open at $18,000.

On October 3, 2007, Disney announced it would open its latest Disney Vacation Club resort on 21 acres it had purchased in Ko Olina Resort, Honolulu/Oahu, with building slated to begin in 2008 with completion in 2011. The resort would offer both DVC units as well as standard hotel rooms for guests of the resort. With the announcement, DVC filed its remaining paperwork to allow its timeshare units to be sold in Hawaii. Three top executives were fired for selling 460 Ko Olina timeshare units for what were deemed unprofitable prices. The Hawaii resort opened as Aulani on August 28, 2011.

In early 2011 it was reported that Disney had purchased land near National Harbor, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., to potentially build a resort similar to the three Disney Vacation Club resorts not located at Walt Disney World. In late November 2011, however, Disney announced that it had canceled plans to build a 500-room resort hotel at National Harbor.

In 2011, the company announced that it would no longer allow secondary market DVC points purchasers to use their points on Disney Cruise Line, Adventures by Disney or the Concierge Collection luxury hotel group. In April 2016, Disney Vacation Development also ended the extension of Membership Extras benefits to those who purchase DVC contracts through secondary markets. Disney was one of the last major timeshare companies to eliminate these benefits according to the American Resort Development Association. In 2019, DVC announced further restrictions on resale purchases. On resale purchases made after January 18, 2019, DVC resale contracts purchased for the original 14 resorts at Walt Disney World, Disneyland, and 3 stand-alone locations will only be able to use their points at those 14 existing resorts and not at the upcoming Riviera and Reflections resorts. Additionally, resale buyers at Riviera will only be allowed to use their points at the Riviera resort.

Starting in mid-2015, DVC began using a nonjudicial foreclosure process forcing auction bidders to be present instead of allowing online bid submissions with the Orange County Clerk of Court&#x27;s office. In May 2016 DVC approved Vacatia for DVC resales. This would be in addition to such sales through Fidelity Resales. In May 2016, DVC announced that its new property at Disney&#x27;s Wilderness Lodge would be called Copper Creek Villas &amp; Cabins.

A brisk aftermarket with a perceived high resale value exists for the Disney timeshare memberships. In May 2016, Sharket time-share market research company issued a 2015 resale value list (having a score based on resale volume and prices) which saw memberships in Disney Vacation Club locations crowded out the competitors. Saratoga Springs, Bay Lake Tower at the Contemporary and Animal Kingdom Villas were the company&#x27;s timeshares near the top of the list.

In November 2019, plans for a 12-story club tower attached to the Disneyland Hotel were filed. The tower opened on September 28, 2023.

In 2022 plans to expand the Villas at Disney&#x27;s Grand Floridian were announced. In 2022, plans to construct a new tower at Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort were announced. On May 10, 2024, it was announced that the name of the new tower would be Island Tower at Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort, which will open on December 17, 2024. On November 26, 2024, it was announced that Reflections – A Disney Lakeside Lodge would instead be named Disney Lakeshore Lodge, which will be opening in 2027 at Walt Disney World Resort.

==Membership==
To be a DVC member, one must purchase a one-time real estate interest in one of the Disney Vacation Club Resorts, and thereafter pay annual dues. All memberships are sold as either a ground lease or a term-for-years. Their timeshare may not be sold in Nebraska. Disney includes a right of first refusal clause in their membership contracts and uses a nonjudicial foreclosure process. The company has only two approved resale companies, Fidelity Resales and Vacatia. Disney also provides time-share loans for the purchaser.

==Locations==

Additionally, participating non-Disney owned destinations are available via exchange through Interval International

<doc id="1126109" wikidata="Q22327806" url="?curid=1126109" title="Photosystem">
<text>Photosystems are functional and structural units of protein complexes involved in photosynthesis. Together they carry out the primary photochemistry of photosynthesis: the absorption of light and the transfer of energy and electrons. Photosystems are found in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. These membranes are located inside the chloroplasts of plants and algae, and in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. There are two kinds of photosystems: PSI and PSII.

PSII will absorb red light, and PSI will absorb far-red light. Although photosynthetic activity will be detected when the photosystems are exposed to either red or far-red light, the photosynthetic activity will be the greatest when plants are exposed to both wavelengths of light. Studies have actually demonstrated that the two wavelengths together have a synergistic effect on the photosynthetic activity, rather than an additive one.

Each photosystem has two parts: a reaction center, where the photochemistry occurs, and an antenna complex, which surrounds the reaction center. The antenna complex contains hundreds of chlorophyll molecules which funnel the excitation energy to the center of the photosystem. At the reaction center, the energy will be trapped and transferred to produce a high energy molecule.

The main function of PSII is to efficiently split water into oxygen molecules and protons. PSII will provide a steady stream of electrons to PSI, which will boost these in energy and transfer them to NADP and H to make NADPH. The hydrogen from this NADPH can then be used in a number of different processes within the plant.

==Reaction centers==

Reaction centers are multi-protein complexes found within the thylakoid membrane.

At the heart of a photosystem lies the reaction center, which is an enzyme that uses light to reduce and oxidize molecules (give off and take up electrons). This reaction center is surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that enhance the absorption of light.

In addition, surrounding the reaction center are pigments which will absorb light. The pigments which absorb light at the highest energy level are found furthest from the reaction center. On the other hand, the pigments with the lowest energy level are more closely associated with the reaction center. Energy will be efficiently transferred from the outer part of the antenna complex to the inner part. This funneling of energy is performed via resonance transfer, which occurs when energy from an excited molecule is transferred to a molecule in the ground state. This ground state molecule will be excited, and the process will continue between molecules all the way to the reaction center. At the reaction center, the electrons on the special chlorophyll molecule will be excited and ultimately transferred away by electron carriers. (If the electrons were not transferred away after excitation to a high energy state, they would lose energy by fluorescence back to the ground state, which would not allow plants to drive photosynthesis.) The reaction center will drive photosynthesis by taking light and turning it into chemical energy that can then be used by the chloroplast.

Two families of reaction centers in photosystems can be distinguished: type I reaction centers (such as photosystem I (P700) in chloroplasts and in green-sulfur bacteria) and type II reaction centers (such as photosystem II (P680) in chloroplasts and in non-sulfur purple bacteria). The two photosystems originated from a common ancestor, but have since diversified.

Each of the photosystem can be identified by the wavelength of light to which it is most reactive (700 nanometers for PSI and 680 nanometers for PSII in chloroplasts), the amount and type of light-harvesting complex present, and the type of terminal electron acceptor used.

Type I photosystems use ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur cluster proteins as terminal electron acceptors, while type II photosystems ultimately shuttle electrons to a quinone terminal electron acceptor. Both reaction center types are present in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, and work together to form a unique photosynthetic chain able to extract electrons from water, creating oxygen as a byproduct.

==Structure of PSI and PSII==
A reaction center comprises several (about 25-30) protein subunits, which provide a scaffold for a series of cofactors. The cofactors can be pigments (like chlorophyll, pheophytin, carotenoids), quinones, or iron-sulfur clusters.

Each photosystem has two main subunits: an antenna complex (a light harvesting complex or LHC) and a reaction center. The antenna complex is where light is captured, while the reaction center is where this light energy is transformed into chemical energy. At the reaction center, there are many polypeptides that are surrounded by pigment proteins. At the center of the reaction center is a special pair of chlorophyll molecules.

Each PSII has about 8 LHCII. These contain about 14 chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; molecules, as well as about four carotenoids. In the reaction center of PSII of plants and cyanobacteria, the light energy is used to split water into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The protons will be used in proton pumping to fuel the ATP synthase at the end of an electron transport chain. A majority of the reactions occur at the D1 and D2 subunits of PSII.

==In oxygenic photosynthesis==

Both photosystem I and II are required for oxygenic photosynthesis. Oxygenic photosynthesis can be performed by plants and cyanobacteria; cyanobacteria are believed to be the progenitors of the photosystem-containing chloroplasts of eukaryotes. Photosynthetic bacteria that cannot produce oxygen have only one photosystem, which is similar to either PSI or PSII.

At the core of photosystem II is P680, a special chlorophyll to which incoming excitation energy from the antenna complex is funneled. One of the electrons of excited P680* will be transferred to a non-fluorescent molecule, which ionizes the chlorophyll and boosts its energy further, enough that it can split water in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of PSII and recover its electron. At the heart of the OEC are 4 Mn atoms, each of which can trap one electron. The electrons harvested from the splitting of two waters fill the OEC complex in its highest-energy state, which holds 4 excess electrons.

Electrons travel through the cytochrome &quot;b6f&quot; complex to photosystem I via an electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane. Energy from PSI drives this process and is harnessed (the whole process is termed chemiosmosis) to pump protons across the membrane, into the thylakoid lumen space from the chloroplast stroma. This will provide a potential energy difference between lumen and stroma, which amounts to a proton-motive force that can be utilized by the proton-driven ATP synthase to generate ATP. If electrons only pass through once, the process is termed noncyclic photophosphorylation, but if they pass through PSI and the proton pump multiple times it is called cyclic photophosphorylation.

When the electron reaches photosystem I, it fills the electron deficit of light-excited reaction-center chlorophyll P700 of PSI. The electron may either continue to go through cyclic electron transport around PSI or pass, via ferredoxin, to the enzyme NADP reductase. Electrons and protons are added to NADP to form NADPH. 
This reducing (hydrogenation) agent is transported to the Calvin cycle to react with glycerate 3-phosphate, along with ATP to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the basic building block from which plants can make a variety of substances.

== Photosystem repair ==
In intense light, plants use various mechanisms to prevent damage to their photosystems. They are able to release some light energy as heat, but the excess light can also produce reactive oxygen species. While some of these can be detoxified by antioxidants, the remaining oxygen species will be detrimental to the photosystems of the plant. More specifically, the D1 subunit in the reaction center of PSII can be damaged. Studies have found that deg1 proteins are involved in the degradation of these damaged D1 subunits. New D1 subunits can then replace these damaged D1 subunits in order to allow PSII to function properly again.

<text>Photosystem II (or water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase) is the first protein complex in the energy-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. It is located in the thylakoid membrane of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Within the photosystem, enzymes capture photons of light to energize electrons that are then transferred through a variety of coenzymes and cofactors to reduce plastoquinone to plastoquinol. The energized electrons are replaced by oxidizing water to form hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen.

By replenishing lost electrons with electrons from the splitting of water, photosystem II provides the electrons for all of photosynthesis to occur. The hydrogen ions (protons) generated by the oxidation of water help to create a proton gradient that is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP. The energized electrons transferred to plastoquinone are ultimately used to reduce to NADPH or are used in non-cyclic electron flow. DCMU is a chemical often used in laboratory settings to inhibit photosynthesis. When present, DCMU inhibits electron flow from photosystem II to plastoquinone.

== Structure of complex ==
The core of PSII consists of a pseudo-symmetric heterodimer of two homologous proteins D1 and D2. Unlike the reaction centers of all other photosystems in which the positive charge sitting on the chlorophyll dimer that undergoes the initial photoinduced charge separation is equally shared by the two monomers, in intact PSII the charge is mostly localized on one chlorophyll center (70−80%). Because of this, P680+ is highly oxidizing and can take part in the splitting of water.

Photosystem II (of cyanobacteria and green plants) is composed of around 20 subunits (depending on the organism) as well as other accessory, light-harvesting proteins. Each photosystem II contains at least 99 cofactors: 35 chlorophyll a, 12 beta-carotene, two pheophytin, two plastoquinone, two heme, one bicarbonate, 20 lipids, the cluster (including two chloride ions), one non heme and two putative ions per monomer. There are several crystal structures of photosystem II. The PDB accession codes for this protein are , , (3BZ1 and 3BZ2 are monomeric structures of the Photosystem II dimer), , , , , , . 


==Oxygen-evolving complex (OEC)==
The oxygen-evolving complex is the site of water oxidation. It is a metallo-oxo cluster comprising four manganese ions (in oxidation states ranging from +3 to +4) and one divalent calcium ion. When it oxidizes water, producing oxygen gas and protons, it sequentially delivers the four electrons from water to a tyrosine (D1-Y161) sidechain and then to P680 itself. It is composed of three protein subunits, OEE1 (PsbO), OEE2 (PsbP) and OEE3 (PsbQ); a fourth PsbR peptide is associated nearby.

The first structural model of the oxygen-evolving complex was solved using X-ray crystallography from frozen protein crystals with a resolution of 3.8Å in 2001. Over the next years the resolution of the model was gradually increased to 2.9Å. While obtaining these structures was in itself a great feat, they did not show the oxygen-evolving complex in full detail. In 2011 the OEC of PSII was resolved to a level of 1.9Å revealing five oxygen atoms serving as oxo bridges linking the five metal atoms and four water molecules bound to the cluster; more than 1,300 water molecules were found in each photosystem II monomer, some forming extensive hydrogen-bonding networks that may serve as channels for protons, water or oxygen molecules. At this stage, it is suggested that the structures obtained by X-ray crystallography are biased, since there is evidence that the manganese atoms are reduced by the high-intensity X-rays used, altering the observed OEC structure. This incentivized researchers to take their crystals to a different X-ray facilities, called X-ray Free Electron Lasers, such as SLAC in the USA. In 2014 the structure observed in 2011 was confirmed. Knowing the structure of Photosystem II did not suffice to reveal how it works exactly. So now the race has started to solve the structure of Photosystem II at different stages in the mechanistic cycle (discussed below). Currently structures of the S1 state and the S3 state&#x27;s have been published almost simultaneously from two different groups, showing the addition of an oxygen molecule designated O6 between Mn1 and Mn4, suggesting that this may be the site on the oxygen evolving complex, where oxygen is produced.

==Water splitting==

Photosynthetic water splitting (or oxygen evolution) is one of the most important reactions on the planet, since it is the source of nearly all the atmosphere&#x27;s oxygen. Moreover, artificial photosynthetic water-splitting may contribute to the effective use of sunlight as an alternative energy source.

The mechanism of water oxidation is understood in substantial detail. The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen requires extraction of four electrons and four protons from two molecules of water. The experimental evidence that oxygen is released through cyclic reaction of oxygen evolving complex (OEC) within one PSII was provided by Pierre Joliot et al. They have shown that, if dark-adapted photosynthetic material (higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria) is exposed to a series of single turnover flashes, oxygen evolution is detected with typical period-four damped oscillation with maxima on the third and the seventh flash and with minima on the first and the fifth flash (for review, see). Based on this experiment, Bessel Kok and co-workers introduced a cycle of five flash-induced transitions of the so-called S-states, describing the four redox states of OEC: When four oxidizing equivalents have been stored (at the S4-state), OEC returns to its basic S0-state. In the absence of light, the OEC will &quot;relax&quot; to the S1 state; the S1 state is often described as being &quot;dark-stable&quot;. The S1 state is largely considered to consist of manganese ions with oxidation states of Mn3+, Mn3+, Mn4+, Mn4+. Finally, the intermediate S-states were proposed by Jablonsky and Lazar as a regulatory mechanism and link between S-states and tyrosine Z.

In 2012, Renger expressed the idea of internal changes of water molecules into typical oxides in different S-states during water splitting.

==Inhibitors==
Inhibitors of PSII are used as herbicides. There are two main chemical families, the triazines derived from cyanuric chloride of which atrazine and simazine are the most commonly used and the aryl ureas which include chlortoluron and diuron (DCMU).

<text>Photosystem I (PSI, or plastocyanin–ferredoxin oxidoreductase) is one of two photosystems in the photosynthetic light reactions of algae, plants, and cyanobacteria. Photosystem I is an integral membrane protein complex that uses light energy to catalyze the transfer of electrons across the thylakoid membrane from plastocyanin to ferredoxin. Ultimately, the electrons that are transferred by Photosystem I are used to produce the moderate-energy hydrogen carrier NADPH. The photon energy absorbed by Photosystem I also produces a proton-motive force that is used to generate ATP. PSI is composed of more than 110 cofactors, significantly more than Photosystem II.

== History ==
This photosystem is known as PSI because it was discovered before Photosystem II, although future experiments showed that Photosystem II is actually the first enzyme of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Aspects of PSI were discovered in the 1950s, but the significance of these discoveries was not yet recognized at the time. Louis Duysens first proposed the concepts of Photosystems I and II in 1960, and, in the same year, a proposal by Fay Bendall and Robert Hill assembled earlier discoveries into a coherent theory of serial photosynthetic reactions. Hill and Bendall&#x27;s hypothesis was later confirmed in experiments conducted in 1961 by the Duysens and Witt groups.

== Components and action ==
Two main subunits of PSI, PsaA and PsaB, are closely related proteins involved in the binding of the vital electron transfer cofactors P, Acc, A, A, and F. PsaA and PsaB are both integral membrane proteins of 730 to 750 amino acids that contain 11 transmembrane segments. A [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster called F is coordinated by four cysteines; two cysteines are provided each by PsaA and PsaB. The two cysteines in each are proximal and located in a loop between the ninth and tenth transmembrane segments. A leucine zipper motif seems to be present downstream of the cysteines and could contribute to dimerisation of PsaA/PsaB. The terminal electron acceptors F and F, also [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters, are located in a 9-kDa protein called PsaC that binds to the PsaA/PsaB core near F.

=== Photon ===

Photoexcitation of the pigment molecules in the antenna complex induces electron and energy transfer.

=== Antenna complex ===

The antenna complex is composed of molecules of chlorophyll and carotenoids mounted on two proteins. These pigment molecules transmit the resonance energy from photons when they become photoexcited. Antenna molecules can absorb all wavelengths of light within the visible spectrum. The number of these pigment molecules varies from organism to organism. For instance, the cyanobacterium &quot;Synechococcus elongatus&quot; (&quot;Thermosynechococcus elongatus&quot;) has about 100 chlorophylls and 20 carotenoids, whereas spinach chloroplasts have around 200 chlorophylls and 50 carotenoids. Located within the antenna complex of PSI are molecules of chlorophyll called P700 reaction centers. The energy passed around by antenna molecules is directed to the reaction center. There may be as many as 120 or as few as 25 chlorophyll molecules per P700.

=== P700 reaction center ===

The P700 reaction center is composed of modified chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; that best absorbs light at a wavelength of 700 nm. P700 receives energy from antenna molecules and uses the energy from each photon to raise an electron to a higher energy level (P700*). These electrons are moved in pairs in an oxidation/reduction process from P700* to electron acceptors, leaving behind P700. The pair of P700* - P700 has an electric potential of about −1.2 volts. The reaction center is made of two chlorophyll molecules and is therefore referred to as a dimer. The dimer is thought to be composed of one chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecule and one chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;′ molecule. However, if P700 forms a complex with other antenna molecules, it can no longer be a dimer.

=== Modified chlorophyll A and A ===

The two modified chlorophyll molecules are early electron acceptors in PSI. They are present one per PsaA/PsaB side, forming two branches electrons can take to reach F. A accepts electrons from P700*, passes it to A of the same side, which then passes the electron to the quinone on the same side. Different species seems to have different preferences for either A/B branch.

=== Phylloquinone ===

A phylloquinone, sometimes called vitamin K, is the next early electron acceptor in PSI. It oxidizes A in order to receive the electron and in turn is re-oxidized by F, from which the electron is passed to F and F. The reduction of Fx appears to be the rate-limiting step.

=== Iron–sulfur complex ===

Three proteinaceous iron–sulfur reaction centers are found in PSI. Labeled F, F, and F, they serve as electron relays. F and F are bound to protein subunits of the PSI complex and F is tied to the PSI complex. Various experiments have shown some disparity between theories of iron–sulfur cofactor orientation and operation order. In one model, F passes an electron to F, which passes it on to F to reach the ferredoxin.

=== Ferredoxin ===

Ferredoxin (Fd) is a soluble protein that facilitates reduction of to NADPH. Fd moves to carry an electron either to a lone thylakoid or to an enzyme that reduces . Thylakoid membranes have one binding site for each function of Fd. The main function of Fd is to carry an electron from the iron-sulfur complex to the enzyme ferredoxin– reductase.

=== Ferredoxin– reductase (FNR) ===

This enzyme transfers the electron from reduced ferredoxin to to complete the reduction to NADPH. FNR may also accept an electron from NADPH by binding to it.

=== Plastocyanin ===
Plastocyanin is an electron carrier that transfers the electron from cytochrome b6f to the P700 cofactor of PSI in its ionized state P700.

== Ycf4 protein domain ==
The Ycf4 protein domain found on the thylakoid membrane is vital to photosystem I. This thylakoid transmembrane protein helps assemble the components of photosystem I. Without it, photosynthesis would be inefficient.

== Evolution ==

Molecular data show that PSI likely evolved from the photosystems of green sulfur bacteria. The photosystems of green sulfur bacteria and those of cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants are not the same, but there are many analogous functions and similar structures. Three main features are similar between the different photosystems. First, redox potential is negative enough to reduce ferredoxin. Next, the electron-accepting reaction centers include iron–sulfur proteins. Last, redox centres in complexes of both photosystems are constructed upon a protein subunit dimer. The photosystem of green sulfur bacteria even contains all of the same cofactors of the electron transport chain in PSI. The number and degree of similarities between the two photosystems strongly indicates that PSI and the analogous photosystem of green sulfur bacteria evolved from a common ancestral photosystem.

<doc id="1126118" wikidata="Q303400" url="?curid=1126118" title="Aase syndrome">
<text>Aase syndrome or Aase–Smith syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by anemia with some joint and skeletal deformities. Aase syndrome is thought to be an autosomal dominant inherited disorder. The genetic basis of the disease is not known. The anemia is caused by underdevelopment of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.

It is named after the American paediatricians Jon Morton Aase and David Weyhe Smith, who characterized it in 1968.

==Signs and symptoms==
Among the presentation are:
* Mildly slowed growth
* Pale skin
* Delayed closure of fontanelles (soft spots)
* Narrow shoulders
* Triple jointed thumbs, absent or small knuckles, decreased skin creases at finger joints
* Inability to fully extend the joints from birth (congenital contractures)
* Cleft palate
* Deformed ears
* Droopy eyelids
===Complications===
* Complications related to anemia include weakness, fatigue, and decreased oxygenation of the blood.
* Decreased white blood cells alter the body&#x27;s ability to fight infection.
* If a heart defect exists, it may cause multiple complications (depending on the specific defect).
* Severe cases have been associated with still birth or early death.

==Cause==
Some cases of Aase syndrome (45%) have been shown to be inherited, and are due to a change in one gene which makes ribosomal proteins. However, many cases are not inherited and occur without a known cause.

==Diagnosis==
* A CBC (complete blood count) will show anemia and a decrease in the white blood cell count.
* An echocardiogram may reveal heart defects (ventricular septal defect is most common).
* X-rays will show skeletal abnormalities as described above.
* A bone marrow biopsy may be performed.

==Prevention==

As with most genetic diseases there is no way to prevent the entire disease. With prompt recognition and treatment of infections in childhood, the complications of low white blood cell counts may be limited.

==Treatment==
Frequent blood transfusions are given in the first year of life to treat anemia. Prednisone may be given, although this should be avoided in infancy because of side effects on growth and brain development. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if other treatment fails.

==Prognosis==
Anemia usually resolves over the years.

<doc id="1126120" wikidata="Q5638002" url="?curid=1126120" title="Hadlock Field">
<text>Delta Dental Park at Hadlock Field is a minor league baseball stadium in Portland, Maine. The stadium is primarily home to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League but also the Portland High School Bulldogs baseball team. The stadium is owned by the city and leased to the Sea Dogs, a Boston Red Sox affiliate owned by Diamond Baseball Holdings.

The stadium is named for Edson B. Hadlock Jr., a long-time Portland High School baseball coach and physics teacher and member of the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame. 

==History and development==
The park opened on April 18, 1994, with a capacity of 6,000. A year later, 500 seats were added. An expansion in 1998 increased capacity to 6,860, and in 2002 to 6,975. About 400 seats were added in right field before the start of the 2006 season, and the park currently seats 7,368. Hadlock Field is located between Interstate 295, the historic Fitzpatrick Stadium, and the Portland Exposition Building, the second-oldest arena in continuous operation in the United States. 

In 2003, when the Sea Dogs affiliated with the Boston Red Sox, various features were added to the stadium to allude to Fenway Park: a replica Green Monster, called the Maine Monster, in left field; a replica Citgo sign; and a large Coke bottle.

In 2006, the tenant Sea Dogs were Eastern League champions. The left-field fence is from home plate, the center-field fence is , and the right-field fence is away. New video boards were added before the 2014 season.

Field of Dreams Day at Hadlock Field is held on the first Sunday of September. It features the team wearing 1926 Portland Eskimos uniforms. Much like the Hollywood film, with the cornfield set up in center field, the Sea Dogs players emerge through the stalks and run onto the field for the Fan Appreciation Day Game.

In April 2018, Hadlock was named one of the ten best Minor League Baseball (MiLB) stadiums. During the 2019 offseason, new lighting was installed, replacing the prior metal-halide lamps with LED lamps and reducing power consumption by nearly 50%.

When a Sea Dogs player hits a home run, or when the team wins, a fog horn sounds and a light house emerges from behind the outfield fence.

In 2024, Maine lawmakers granted the Sea Dogs $2 million in tax breaks for a new player clubhouse and to make renovations to the playing field. The stadium failed to meet facility requirements set by Major League Baseball for stadiums serving MiLB teams. The clubhouse for visiting teams is in the basement of the nearby Portland Exposition Center. After renovations, the Sea Dogs are to move into a new clubhouse, with visiting teams using the vacated clubhouse.

In October 2024, the team announced that it had accepted an undisclosed amount of money to rename the stadium Delta Dental Park at Hadlock Field after the Delta Dental insurance network.

==Maine Monster==
The Maine Monster is the nickname of the left-field wall at Hadlock Field. It is located 315 feet from home plate along the foul lines. It is 160 feet long and made of wood. Like the Green Monster in Fenway Park, it is high, and green. There is a screen above the wall to catch home run balls. Seats cannot be added to the Maine Monster because the Union Branch railroad runs immediately behind it. On September 18, 2002, the Portland Sea Dogs announced a new affiliation with the Boston Red Sox after nine years of affiliation with the Florida Marlins. To help train future Red Sox left fielders for the Green Monster and to add character to the ballpark, a likeness of the Green Monster was built. Construction started on October 28, 2002. The name, Maine Monster, was chosen from a contest of fans.

<text>Christopher Wallace (born October 12, 1947) is an American broadcast journalist. He is known for his tough and wide-ranging interviews, for which he is often compared to his father, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; journalist Mike Wallace. Over his 60-year career in journalism he has been a correspondent, moderator, or anchor on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News, and CNN. In 2018, he was ranked one of America&#x27;s most trusted television news anchors. He has won three Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, a George Polk Award, the duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton Award.

As a teenager, Wallace became an assistant to Walter Cronkite during the 1964 Republican National Convention. After graduating from Harvard University, he worked as a national reporter for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. He transitioned towards broadcast news at NBC (1975–1988), where he served as a White House correspondent, the Sunday anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; (1982–1984, 1986–1987) and moderator of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (1987–1988). He then worked for ABC, where he served as an anchor for &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; (1989–2003). He is the only person to have served as host and moderator of more than one of the major U.S. political Sunday morning talk shows, which he did during his time at NBC.

From 2003 to 2021, he hosted &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, and took high profile interviews with Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin. He made history when he became the first Fox News journalist to moderate a United States Presidential debate in 2016 between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. He returned to moderate the 2020 debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. In 2021 he left Fox to join CNN as host of the interview series &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking to Chris Wallace?&quot; (2022–2024) and anchored &quot;The Chris Wallace Show&quot; (2023–2024). In November 2024, Wallace left CNN following the expiration of his three year contract.

==Early life and education==
Wallace was born in Chicago, Illinois, to longtime CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reporter Mike Wallace and Norma Kaphan. Wallace is Jewish; both his parents were Jewish. He was named Christopher because he was born on Columbus Day. He had an elder brother, Peter (1942–1962), who died at the age of 19 after a mountain climbing accident. His parents divorced when he was one year old; he grew up with his mother and stepfather Bill Leonard, President of CBS News. Leonard gave him early exposure to political journalism, hiring him as an assistant to Walter Cronkite at the 1964 Republican National Convention. Wallace did not develop a relationship with his father, Mike, until the age of 14.
Wallace attended the Hotchkiss School and Harvard College. He first reported news on-air for WHRB, the student radio station at Harvard. He memorably covered the 1969 student occupation of University Hall and was detained by Cambridge policemen, using his one phone call to sign off a report from Cambridge City Jail with &quot;This is Chris Wallace from WHRB News reporting from Middlesex County Jail in custody.&quot;

==Career==
=== Career beginnings: The Boston Globe ===

Although accepted at Yale Law School, he decided to work for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, where his boss described him as an &quot;aggressive and ambitious reporter&quot;. He first covered City Hall during the time Kevin White was mayor of Boston and later became a roving national reporter. Wallace noticed the power of television when he saw all the reporters at the 1972 political conventions were watching the proceedings on television instead of in person. For a time in the early 1970s, he worked for the Chicago station WBBM-TV, which is owned and operated by CBS.

===1975–1988: Network journalism debut at NBC News ===
After seeing the impact television had on news at the 1972 Republican National Convention, he focused on working on broadcast news, first at NBC (1975–1988). Wallace began his network journalism career with NBC in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years as a reporter with WNBC-TV in New York City. Wallace then transferred to NBC&#x27;s Washington bureau as a political correspondent for NBC News and later served as Washington co-anchor and news reader for the &quot;Today&quot; show with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley in 1982. That same year, he also served as chief White House correspondent (1982–1989) alongside contemporaries CBS&#x27;s Lesley Stahl and ABC&#x27;s Sam Donaldson. He later served as anchor of the Sunday edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; (1982–1984, 1986–1987), and moderator of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (1987–1988).

On May 18, 1985, as part of an NBC News special, Wallace did a joint interview with Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan at Camp David. Some journalists have described Wallace&#x27;s style as confrontational. During President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s news conference in March 1987, when Reagan admitted to dealing arms for hostages, Wallace asked Reagan why he had denied that Israel was involved with the arms sales to Iran &quot;when you knew that wasn&#x27;t true.&quot; In 1988, Wallace covered the 1988 Republican National Convention for NBC News, where he interviewed political figures, including real estate tycoon Donald Trump questioning him about flirting with running for political office.

===1989–2003: ABC News correspondent ===

Wallace left NBC in late 1988 for ABC. Sam Donaldson, ABC&#x27;s outgoing chief White House correspondent, said he was &quot;delighted&quot; and &quot;very pleased&quot; that Wallace, his journalistic rival, would be joining the network saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked his work, I think he&#x27;s going to be a plus.&quot; At ABC News, Wallace was the senior correspondent for &quot;Primetime Live&quot; and occasionally hosted &quot;Nightline&quot;. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missile attacks. At the time, the Israeli government did not want to advertise where the Scuds landed to prevent the Iraqis from adjusting their launchers. On one episode of &quot;Nightline&quot;, Wallace started describing the location where a Scud missile landed in Tel Aviv. Host Ted Koppel cut him off and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.

===2003–2021: Fox News and presidential debates ===
 &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; 

After 14 years at ABC, Wallace left in 2003 to join Fox News. Wallace began hosting &quot;Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace&quot; in 2003 after replacing Tony Snow. Wallace and Shepard Smith gained a reputation at Fox for their reputable status as journalists on the network. In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Howard Kurtz wrote, &quot;Fox seems to be inching toward more conventional journalism.&quot; When asked about his political opinions, Wallace stated, &quot;Do I have political opinions? Absolutely. But I vote for the person, and I&#x27;ve voted for Republicans and Democrats and independents over the course of my life. I feel very strongly that you try not to let that affect the way you report the news.&quot; Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes called Wallace &quot;one of the best interviewers in the business. ... I have no idea what he thinks personally, but he asks tough questions of everybody.&quot;

Throughout his 18 years at Fox, Wallace had participated in coverage of nearly every major political event and secured several high-profile interviews with dignitaries and U.S. leaders. In February 2009, he secured Fox&#x27;s first interview with President Barack Obama. On March 3, 2016, Wallace joined Bret Baier, and Megyn Kelly in moderating the 2016 Republican Party Presidential debate on Fox News. In 2017, he interviewed President Donald Trump in his first interview since being elected.

 Debates, coverage, and interviews 

The Commission on Presidential Debates selected Chris Wallace as moderator of the third and final 2016 Presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The debate was held on October 19, 2016, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This was the first time a Fox News anchor had moderated a general election presidential debate. After he was selected, Wallace said, &quot;it&#x27;s not my job&quot; to fact-check candidates, but that it was the job of the opposing candidate. Wallace stated, &quot;I take it very seriously, this is not a TV show. This is part of civics, the constitution, if you will, in action, because this is helping millions of people decide who we&#x27;re going to elect as the next president&quot;.

He received notable praise from both sides of the aisle for his tough questioning of both presidential candidates at that last presidential debate of the 2016 election. Afterward, Jennifer Rubin in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that, despite her strong disapproval of other Fox News commentators, &quot;No one could watch the final debate and deny that Chris Wallace is among the best in the business.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Wallace mixed humor with scolding and persistence with patience to guide his charges toward the most substantive encounter of an unusually vicious election.&quot;

 Interview with Vladimir Putin (2018) 
In July 2018, Wallace interviewed Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Wallace questioned Putin about why so many of his political opponents end up dead, and sought to hand Putin papers containing the indictment of 12 Russian agents for interference in the 2016 election. Putin declined to touch the papers. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Aaron Blake, Putin was &quot;clearly frustrated by a journalist actually challenging him&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wallace&#x27;s interview was &quot;widely praised&quot;. His interview earned him a News and Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Live Interview. It was the first News and Documentary Award in Fox News&#x27; history.

In September 2018, Wallace covered the Supreme Court hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, during which Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by multiple women, including Christine Blasey Ford. Wallace described Ford&#x27;s testimony as &quot;extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible...nobody could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on his life, on her life, and not have your heart go out to her. She obviously was traumatized by an event.&quot; He also described the cross-examination format as &quot;a disaster for the Republicans.&quot; When Ford&#x27;s testimony was criticized by conservative pundits, Wallace discussed how his daughters had related their own previously undisclosed experiences. Wallace said they &quot;hadn&#x27;t told their parents, I don&#x27;t know if they told their friends. Certainly had never reported it to police...But the point is that there are teenage girls who don&#x27;t tell stories to a lot of people, and then it comes up, and I don&#x27;t think we can disregard that, I don&#x27;t think we can disregard Christine Blasey Ford and the seriousness of this. I think that would be a big mistake.&quot;

 Coverage of the impeachment of Donald Trump 

On January 27, 2020, Wallace got into a heated exchange with conservative pundit Katie Pavlich of &quot;TownHall.com&quot; on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; as to whether or not additional witnesses should be allowed to testify during the 2020 Impeachment trial of Donald Trump in the Senate. Pavlich argued that Republicans should be allowed to deny Democrats the right to call witnesses during the trial citing the 1998 Investigation and Impeachment of Bill Clinton. Wallace objected stating, &quot;So we just shouldn&#x27;t listen to what John Bolton has to say?&quot;, elaborating, &quot;To say in the Clinton investigation, these people who were interviewed by the House — one, they weren&#x27;t — and to say that it wasn&#x27;t done by the Justice Department... It wasn&#x27;t done because the Justice Department refused to carry out the investigation! Get your facts straight!&quot;

 Interview with Donald Trump (2020) 

On July 19, 2020, Wallace sat down with President Donald Trump for a wide-ranging interview outside The White House. The interview gained much attention on social media and conventional news outlets for its content. Wallace earned praise for holding Trump accountable and fact-checking him in real time. In the midst of the ongoing nationwide Black Lives Matter protests over the murder of George Floyd, Wallace pressed Trump on his claim that Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee wanted to &quot;defund and abolish&quot; the police by replying &quot;No, sir, he does not.&quot; In reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallace also challenged Trump on his exaggerated claims concerning the mortality rate and testing for COVID-19. When confronted by the statistics, the President responded: &quot;I&#x27;ll be right eventually.&quot; Many have compared the interview style with that of Wallace&#x27;s father, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; journalist Mike Wallace. This includes Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University who teaches a class on &quot;the art of the interview&quot;, who stated, &quot;He&#x27;s very good at this. He&#x27;s been doing this for a long time. And he&#x27;s got the Wallace DNA.&quot; Many noticed Trump&#x27;s awkwardness during the interview, including Meghan McCain who stated on &quot;The View&quot; that, &quot;it was the first time I&#x27;ve really seen President Trump squirm.&quot;

 First presidential debate (2020) 

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) selected Wallace as moderator of the first presidential debate, held on September 29, 2020, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The debate was deemed a &quot;disaster&quot; by various news pundits for its lack of decorum, civility, and content. During the debate, Wallace tried to gain control numerous times including stopping the debate and telling the candidates, specifically Trump, &quot;So here&#x27;s the deal...I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions, I&#x27;m appealing to you sir&quot;.

Numerous post debate polls declared Biden the winner of the debate. In response to the debate, Wallace shared his frustration with the President in an interview with Bill Hemmer where he stated that Trump &quot;bears the primary responsibility for what happened&quot; and that &quot;It was frustrating for me because I tried hard to prepare for a serious debate, much more frustrating and more importantly for the American people because they didn&#x27;t get the debate they wanted that they deserved.&quot; Some viewers, including several Fox News personalities, accused Wallace of unfairness towards Trump, though Fox News executives released a statement commending Wallace&#x27;s &quot;professionalism, skill and fortitude in a unique situation.&quot; The CPD also praised Wallace stating, they were &quot;grateful to Chris Wallace for the professionalism and skill he brought to last night&#x27;s debate&quot; while also stating they intend to ensure that additional tools to maintain order are in place for the remaining debates.&quot;

 2020 U.S. presidential election 

On November 3, Wallace joined Brit Hume, Juan Williams, and Dana Perino in Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum&#x27;s election night coverage of the 2020 presidential election on Fox News. Wallace defended the network&#x27;s decision to call Arizona for Biden over Trump despite being under tremendous pressure from Trump and his campaign. Later that night, Trump prematurely declared victory in the election, saying: &quot;Frankly, we did win this election,&quot; despite there having been too few results received from other states for either Trump or Biden to have won. Trump also stated he wanted &quot;all the voting to stop&quot;. Wallace reacted to the President&#x27;s claim by stating on air: &quot;This is an extremely flammable situation and the president just threw a match into it. He hasn&#x27;t won these states ... the president doesn&#x27;t get to say he won states ... there&#x27;s no question that all these states can continue to count votes.&quot; Wallace further condemned Trump&#x27;s wanting to halt votes from being counted by saying that it was &quot;extremely irresponsible&quot; and that he didn&#x27;t think the courts would allow it.

=== 2022–2024: Transition to CNN and departure ===
 &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking to Chris Wallace?&quot; 

On the December 12, 2021, episode of &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, Wallace announced that it would be his final day hosting the program. It was later announced that Wallace had been hired by CNN to host a new program for its streaming service CNN+, which launched in April 2022. Wallace stated the show was inspired by Larry King, Charlie Rose, and his father Mike Wallace. Wallace had complained to Fox management about its opinion hosts, in particular Sean Hannity&#x27;s and Tucker Carlson&#x27;s increasing emphasis on untruths about the January 6 United States Capitol attack and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Wallace was particularly disturbed by Carlson&#x27;s special &quot;Patriot Purge&quot;. He said the work environment at Fox grew &quot;increasingly unsustainable&quot; for him after the 2020 election. In an interview in 2024, he claimed the reason he left Fox was because he had enough of their &quot;lies&quot; and &quot;conspiracies&quot;.

On April 21, 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN and CNN+, announced they were shutting down CNN+, which occurred on April 28. At their Upfront presentation the following month, it was revealed that &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; had gone back into production, and would make its new home at CNN and HBO Max. In its first season Wallace interviewed former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, actor George Clooney, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, comedian Billy Crystal, athlete Alex Rodriguez, musician Meghan Trainor, chef José Andrés, and author James Patterson. Other notable interviews throughout the rest of its run were with James Cameron, Hugh Jackman, Harrison Ford, Matt Damon, Bernie Sanders, Charlamagne tha God, Bill Maher, Larry David, and Stephen A. Smith. Following Wallace&#x27;s departure from CNN, &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; ended on November 15, 2024.

 &quot;The Chris Wallace Show&quot; 

In August 2023, it was announced in a major news programming overhaul that Wallace would host a new CNN Saturday morning program called &quot;The Chris Wallace Show&quot; from 10 to 11 a.m. Eastern Time Zone. He will continue to host &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking to Chris Wallace?&quot;. The program consisted of Wallace and a panel of reporters and commentators discussing the notable political stories of the week. Additional segments included &quot;Yea or Nay&quot;, in which panelists gave their approval or disapproval to a new social trend, and &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot;, in which panelists predicted what the biggest news story would be in the coming weeks. Regular panelists included Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Kara Swisher, Kristin Soltis Anderson, and Reihan Salam. The final episode aired on November 23, 2024.

 Departure from CNN 

Despite the network pushing for him to stay, Wallace declined to extend his contract with CNN, and will depart the network by the end of year, with plans for an independent venture into streaming or podcasting. Puck News claimed that prior to the announcement of his departure, CNN CEO Mark Thompson had informed Wallace that &quot;Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; and &quot;The Chris Wallace Show&quot; would be cancelled due to low ratings, but that he was welcome to stay on as an analyst on a significantly reduced salary. Wallace denied to Puck that he discussed a future role on CNN, and said that he decided with his wife to leave the network six months before his announcement.

==Media appearances==
In 2012, Wallace appeared on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; during &quot;Power Players Week&quot;, which featured journalists, politicians, and television personalities as contestants. He competed against BBC journalist Katty Kay, and television personality Dr. Oz. Wallace won the game with $22,400 to Kay&#x27;s $8,000 and Oz&#x27;s $5,900.

In July 2019, Wallace appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; to promote a documentary about his father, &quot;Mike Wallace is Here&quot;.

In December 2019, Wallace stated at the Washington Media Museum: &quot;Trump is engaged in the most direct sustained assault on freedom of the press in our history.&quot; He also stated that in his 50-year career in journalism, his highlights include &quot;spending a week with Mother Teresa in Calcutta&quot;, covering Ronald Reagan across the world for ABC News, and interviewing Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, where he asked, &quot;Why do so many people who oppose you end up dead?&quot;

==Personal life==
Wallace has said that despite his blood relationship with his father, Mike, his stepfather, Bill Leonard, had far more impact on his life. Wallace said that Leonard was &quot;the single most important person in my life&quot;. Wallace first developed a relationship with his father in his teens, after his older brother Peter died in 1962 climbing a mountain in Greece.

Wallace has been married twice. In 1973, he married Elizabeth Farrell, with whom he has four children: Peter (father of William, Caroline, and James), Megan (mother of Sabine and Livia), Catherine, and Andrew (father of Jack and Luke). In 1997, he married Lorraine Smothers (née Martin, born 1959), the former wife of Dick Smothers. Lorraine has two children from her previous marriage: Sarah Smothers and Remick Smothers. Wallace&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Jennifer Breheny Wallace, wife of his son Peter, is a journalist and bestselling author of the 2023 New York Times best selling book &quot;Never Enough&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Wallace was registered as a Democrat in Washington, D.C., and had been so for more than two decades. Wallace said that he did so for pragmatic reasons, in response to the party&#x27;s preeminence in the city&#x27;s politics, commenting: &quot;If you want a say in who&#x27;s going to be the next mayor or councilman, you have to vote in the Democratic primary.&quot; He maintained that he had previously voted for candidates from both major parties.

Wallace and his wife primarily reside in Annapolis, Maryland.

== In popular culture ==
In 2016, Wallace was portrayed by Tom Hanks on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the Third Presidential Debate Cold Open. He was played by Beck Bennett in 2020.

In 2019, Wallace was portrayed by Marc Evan Jackson in Jay Roach&#x27;s film &quot;Bombshell&quot;.

<text>The Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (German: &quot;Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung&quot;) is located in Bremerhaven, Germany, and a member of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. It conducts research in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the high and mid latitude oceans. Additional research topics are: North Sea research, marine biological monitoring, and technical marine developments. The institute was founded in 1980 and is named after meteorologist, climatologist, and geologist Alfred Wegener.

AWI is the biggest institution for polar and ocean research and science in Germany. The annual budget is 140 Mio EUR (2018) and the institute has a staff of more than 1000 people.

== History ==

The foundation of the AWI happened in a political environment that was characterized by system competition between East and West. The GDR had been conducting its own Antarctic research for decades. In the 1970s it became clear that there would be one scarcity of biological- and mineral resources. Also due to the experience of the oil crisis of 1973, the Federal Republic of Germany decided to intensify its activities in polar research for geostrategic reasons and undertake larger research projects in the Antarctic Ocean and in Antarctica. In 1975/76 and 1977/78 expeditions were conducted to exploration of migration routs of the krill.

In 1978 the German Bundestag decided that polar research will be a governmental task of national interest, that West Germany will become a member of the Antarctic Treaty System and will found a polar research institute. In 1980 the &quot;AWI act&quot; was decided by the Bürgerschaft of Bremen.

The founding director was Gotthilf Hempel. The construction of the first German antarctic base, the first Georg von Neumayer station (GvN station I), had already begun in 1979. In 1981 the station was operational. In 1978, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research commissioned the tender for a research icebreaker. After the public tender, the hull of the first German polar research ship was laid by HDW Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in 1981. The RV Polarstern has been in operation for the AWI since 1982.

On 24 February 1985, the &quot;Polar 3&quot;, a research airplane of the institute of the type Dornier 228, was shot down by members of Polisario Front over West Sahara. Both pilots and the mechanic died. &quot;Polar 3&quot;, together with unharmed &quot;Polar 2&quot;, was on its way back from Antarctica and had taken off in Dakar, Senegal, to reach Arrecife, Canary Islands.

In 1986 the main building of AWi were built at &quot;Old harbour&quot; (Alten Hafen) in the center of Bremerhaven by plans of architect Oswald Mathias Ungers &quot;(Building D).&quot; In 2004 the headquarter of AWI moved to Fischereihafenschleuse and a new building by Otto Steidle had been built at Am Handelshafen.

In January 2005, Polar 4 was severely damaged during a rough landing at the British overwintering station Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. As it was impossible to repair the plane, the aircraft had to be decommissioned. Since then, scientific and logistical tasks of polar flights have been performed by &quot;Polar 2&quot;.

After years of preparation, Alfred Wegener Institute conduct up from September 2019 the international Arctic expedition MOSAiC (the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate), which was one of the largest research actions of its kind. Around 442 scientists from 20 countries worked at different tasks in extreme weather. The research expedition had a budget of 140 million Euros. Also no other polar research trip was exploited as much in the media as the MOSAiC expedition since then. The Alfred Wegener Institute increased its press department before and during the expedition, hired a &quot;Communications Manager MOSAiC&quot; and an own photographer to feed “MOSAiC” channels on Twitter and Instagram.

At the beginning, the AWI focus was to set up the complex infrastructure for research in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In addition to international prestige, the territorial claim to resources from terrestrial and maritime areas was one of the reasons for Germany for the cost-intensive work of Alfred Wegener Institute. Climatologists and geophysicists at AWI recognized the fatal effects of global warming in the most affected geographical areas in the 1980s early on, but gained less attention outside the scientific community. In the 1990s, the mainly geophysical-oceanographic research was expanded to include the biological aspects of polar and deep-sea habitats, among other things. From the 2000s, the problem of climate change reached the consciousness of German society and the politics that funded the AWI. The focus and promotion of the institus work get adopted to the debate about global change. Current projects had often also the aim to research special aspect of climate change and the effectes of global warming especially to the polar regions. With the director Boetius, the public relations and the marketing of the polar research were pushed forward.

In 2024, the AWI signed a memorandum of understanding with Antarctica New Zealand to foster cooperation between the two polar science bodies, amid China&#x27;s growing presence in Antarctica.

== Research ==
The institute has three major departments: 
*Climate System Department, which studies oceans, ice and atmosphere as physical and chemical systems.
*Biosciences Department, which studies the biological processes in marine and coastal ecosystems.
*Geoscientific Department, which studies climate development, especially as revealed by sediments.

== Facilities ==
The institute is distributed over several sites within North Germany and the Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research (OSL) at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in Saint Petersburg as Russian-German cooperation in the field of Arctic research, named after the polar explorer Otto Schmidt.

===Bremerhaven===

The headquarters was founded by Gotthilf Hempel. Nowadays, the AWI has several buildings within the city of Bremerhaven.

* Building D is located next to the old port (German: &quot;Alter Hafen&quot;). The dark clink-brick building was designed by Oswald Mathias Ungers in 1985 who won the architecture-award &quot;BDA-prize&quot; for the building. It hosts the AWI library, the main lecture hall and various laboratories and offices.
* The main building E is next to the lock &quot;Doppelschleuse&quot;. Main characteristics are the chequered tiles and the fact that there are three office towers. The building was designed by Otto Steidle and constructed in 2004 as an extension of the complex A, B, C.
* House F is close to the Weser ferry at the Geeste estuary. The housing association StäWoG (German: &quot;Städtische Wohnungsgesellschaft&quot;) renovated the building of the former nautical college (German: &quot;Hochschule für Seefahrt&quot;) in 1999. For this reason, there is a planetarium which is nowadays used by the Bremerhaven&#x27;s friends of the stars.
* The small Bathymetry Building is located close to the radar tower.
* The Nordsee Villa formerly belonged to the fast-food restaurant chain Nordsee and hosts a few offices of AWI. Nowadays it is a Haus der Technik and part of the oldest German institute for technical further education with close cooperation to RWTH Aachen and other universities.
* The Harbour Warehouse (German: &quot;Hafenlager&quot;) is located within the Lloyd Werft, see Lloyd Werft Map.

===Potsdam===
The Forschungsstelle Potsdam is situated on the Telegrafenberg next to Potsdam. It belongs to AWI since 1992. The research focuses on the atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry of the atmosphere on the one hand and periglacial research on the other hand.

===Sylt===
The Wadden Sea Station Sylt is located on the North German island Sylt.
It was founded in 1924 as an oyster laboratory to study the decline of oyster stocks and in order to study how they could be cultivated. In 1937, the name changed from &quot;oyster laboratory&quot; to &quot;Wadden Sea station&quot;. The station grew, and in 1949 the station was shifted from the northernmost edge of the island to the current location, next to the harbor of List. In 1998 the station became part of AWI. Nowadays, there are about 30 scientists and technicians. Two guest houses allow to perform workshops and video conferences are possible with the AWI headquarters.

The research focuses on coast ecology and coast geology. In the 1930 there have been oyster reefs below the mussel banks at the water level. Below these, there have been sabellaria reefs which have been destroyed by fishery. Nowadays there are only the mussel banks left.

===Helgoland===
The Biologische Anstalt Helgoland is situated at on the island Heligoland (German: &quot;Helgoland&quot;). The station exists since 1892. Scientists study the ecology of the North Sea in this research station.

Since 1962, at Heligoland roadstead , phytoplankton and water samples are taken every weekday morning, 
the turbidity is measured (e.g. using a Secchi disk) and other parameters are recorded. The North Sea warmed by 1.65 °C since the start of the time series.

==Stations==
The institute maintains several research stations around the Arctic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent.

===Neumayer Station===

Neumayer Station III is located at , about away from the previous station, &quot;Neumayer II&quot; which is now abandoned and covered by a thick ice cover. The new station (Webcam) is a futuristic-looking combined platform above the snow surface offering space for research, operations, and living since 2009. The station stands on 16 hydraulic posts which are used to adjust the building to the growing snow cover. A balloon-launching hall is located on the stations roof. Below the station PistenBully, Ski-Doos, sledges, and other equipment are stored in a garage built beneath the snow, with a ramp with a lid that seals the hole for the vehicles to enter.
In summer, the station can host up to 40 people. The station contains several laboratories, has a weather balloon launching facility, and a hospital with telemedical equipment. The station has a stairwell and several utility and storage rooms in the garage. There is a snowmelt and power unit at the station.

===Dallmann Laboratory===

In cooperation with the Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA), in 1994 the AWI opened a research station on King George Island at . The station is named after Eduard Dallmann, a German whaler, trader and Polar explorer who lived near Bremen.

===Koldewey Station===

Koldewey Station at is named after the German polar explorer Carl Koldewey and part of the French-German Arctic Research &quot;AWIPEV&quot; Arctic in Ny-Ålesund on Svalbard.

===Kohnen Station===

Kohnen Station was established in 2001 as logistical base for ice core drilling in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, at 

===Samoylov Station===
Samoylov Station is a Russian research station at lays within the Lena Delta close to the Laptev Sea. The station was set up as a logistic base for joint Russian-German permafrost studies by the &quot;Lena Delta Reserve&quot; (LDR) and the AWI.

==Ships==
Altogether there are six ships that belong to AWI.

===RV &quot;Polarstern&quot;===

The AWI flagship is Germany&#x27;s research icebreaker RV &quot;Polarstern&quot;. The ship was commissioned in 1982. The double-hulled icebreaker is operational up to temperatures as low as −50 °C (−58 °F). Polarstern can break through sea ice of 1.5 m thickness at a speed of 5 knots, thicker ice must be broken by ramming. In 2022 the German Bundestag approved 2 million Euros budget for the contract award procedure for the construction of the new icebreaker &quot;Polarstern II&quot;.

===RV &quot;Heincke&quot;===
The vessel RV &quot;Heincke&quot; is a multifunctional and low-noise ship for research in ice-free waters, named after German zoologist and ichthyologist Friedrich Heincke . With a length of 54.6 m, a width of 12.5 m and a draft 4.16 m, the ship is categorized as &quot;medium research vessel&quot; within the German research fleet. 
The ship was put into operation in 1990, its building costs have been around 16 Millionen Euro.
On the vessel, up to 12 scientists and 8 crew members can work for up to 30 passage days. This corresponds to an operating range of roughly 7500 nautical miles. The shipowner is Briese Schiffahrts GmbH &amp; Co. KG from Leer, a city in East Frisia.

===RV &quot;Uthörn&quot;===

The research cutter RV &quot;Uthörn&quot; is named after the small island Uthörn next to Sylt in the North Sea. The vessel is regularly on research tours in German Bight, but is also used to supply the AWI branch &quot;Biologische Anstalt Helgoland&quot; mentioned above. Two scientists and four crew members can live and work on board for up to 180 days, but the vessel mainly used for day trips. Another operation purpose are short term cruises of a few hours for up to 25 students to demonstrate oceanographic and biological sampling methods.

Being commissioned in 1982 RV &quot;Uthörn&quot; replaced a vessel with the same name which was built in 1947 and had a length of 24 m. The current vessel is powered by two V12
four-stroke Diesel engines manufactured by the company MWM GmbH from Mannheim. Each engine delivers up to 231 kW to a controllable-pitch propeller; the maximal speed is around 10 kn.
On the working deck, there is a dry lab and a laboratory for wet work like sorting fish. The ship is equipped with standard sampling devices: You may find on board a demersal trawl, a Van Veen Grab Sampler, Niskin bottles, and even deprecated reversing thermometers for teaching purposes.

===&quot;Mya&quot;, &quot;Mya II&quot;, &quot;Aade&quot; and &quot;Diker&quot;===
The research catamaran &quot;Mya&quot; was a specially designed for research in the intertidal zone, it could fall dry at low tide. In 2013 it was replaced by the conventional ship &quot;Mya II&quot;. The main research area is the Wadden Sea and offshore wind farms. 
Last but not least, there are two small motor boats, &quot;Aade&quot; and &quot;Diker&quot; for sampling and diving operations around Heligoland.

==Aircraft==

===Past aircraft===

The Alfred Wegener Institute operated five airplanes under the name of &quot;Polar&quot;, those being:
* &quot;Polar 1&quot;, a Dornier 128 commissioned in 1983, now in possession of the &quot;TU Braunschweig&quot;
* &quot;Polar 2&quot;, a Dornier 228 commissioned in 1983, still in service with the AWI
* &quot;Polar 3&quot;, like &quot;Polar 2&quot; commissioned in 1983, shot down possibly by SA-2 Guideline missile on 24 February 1985 over Western Sahara
* &quot;Polar 4&quot;, a Dorniers 228 commissioned in 1985, severely damaged at a landing at the British Rothera Research Station in 2005, now on display at the Institute

===Current fleet===

Homeport of AWI-fleet is Bremen Airport. AWI uses two Basler BT-67.These planes are 20 m long, 5.2 m high and have a wingspan of 29 m. The empty weight is 7680 kg, with ski landing gear it weighs 8340 kg.
The minimal cruising speed is 156 km/h, the maximum is SFA. Without payload, the flying range is around 3900 km. The planes are maintained by the company Kenn Borek Air located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

====Polar 5====
The plane hull was built in 1942 but completely refurbished after the AWI acquired the plane in 2007. Since then it &quot;has supplied a large volume of valuable data&quot; said Prof. Heinrich Miller, the former director of the AWI.

====Polar 6====
This plane with the call sign C-GHGF was acquired by AWI in 2011. The BMBF, the German Federal Minister of Education and Research funded the purchase and equipping of the plane with a total of 9.78 million euros.

<doc id="1126139" wikidata="Q838955" url="?curid=1126139" title="Lear's macaw">
<text>Lear&#x27;s macaw (Anodorhynchus leari), also known as the indigo macaw, is a large all-blue Brazilian parrot, a member of a large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. It was first described by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Lear&#x27;s macaw is long and weighs around . It is coloured almost completely blue, with a yellow patch of skin at the base of the heavy, black bill.

Although there are records of the macaw from Britain from the early 1830s, this bird was only generally recognised as an independent species in the late 1970s. It is rare with a highly restricted native range, which was only discovered in 1978, although intensive conservation efforts have increased the world population about thirtyfold in the first two decades of the 21st century. It inhabits a dry desert-like shrubby environment known as &quot;caatinga&quot;, and roosts and nests in cavities in sandstone cliffs. It mostly feeds on the nuts of the palm species &quot;Syagrus coronata&quot;, as well as raiding maize from local farmers. Its ecology also appears curiously linked to cattle ranching.

==Taxonomy==

Lear&#x27;s macaw was named after the famous poet, Edward Lear, who was also an accomplished artist. In his teens in the early 1830s, Lear published a book of drawings and paintings of live parrots in zoos and collections, &quot;Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots&quot;. One of his paintings in his book strongly resembles this species, and although at the time he titled the work as &#x27;hyacinth macaw&#x27; — a larger, darker species with a differently shaped patch of yellow skin adjacent to the base of the bill, which it closely resembles — not everyone agreed, and a quarter century later, in 1856, the illustration was given a species description by the French ornithologist and nephew of Emperor Napoleon, Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte, who chose to commemorate the poet in the specific name. Most authorities, however, were unconvinced of the distinctness of the new taxon. The rarely seen bird was not considered a distinct species until 1978, when German-born, Brazilian-naturalised ornithologist Helmut Sick finally located the wild population.

==Description==
Lear&#x27;s macaw is long and weighs around .

The body, tail, and wings are dark metallic blue with a faint, often barely visible, tinge of green, and the head is a slightly paler shade. It has an area of pale-yellow skin adjacent to the base of its beak, and orange-yellow eye rings. It has a large, blackish beak and dark grey feet.

Lear&#x27;s macaw is similar to the larger hyacinth macaw and the slightly smaller glaucous macaw. The hyacinth macaw can be distinguished by its darker plumage, lack of greenish tinge, and a differently shaped patch of yellow skin adjacent to the base of the bill. The glaucous macaw is paler and has a more greyish head.

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Feeding===
The primary diet of Lear&#x27;s macaw are the nuts (as many as 350 per day) of the palm &quot;Syagrus coronata&quot;, locally known as &quot;licuri&quot;, but the seeds of &quot;Melanoxylon&quot;, &quot;Jatropha mollissima&quot;, &quot;Dioclea&quot;, &quot;Spondias tuberosa&quot;, &quot;Schinopsis brasiliensis&quot; and &quot;Zea mays&quot; are also eaten, as well as the flowers of &quot;Agave&quot;.

The macaw usually forages in groups. They preferentially feed on the palms where they grow in groves, mixed together with taller trees. At least thirty confirmed feeding localities are known throughout the range. A tall tree is selected by the flock as base to carefully inspect the feeding area. First a pair descends to the level of the palms to assess the suitability, the pair then returns to base, and then the entire flock descends to decide if it is worth staying around. If it is, then the macaws generally feed directly at the site, tearing the fibrous pulp off the fruit to obtain the extremely hard and thick-shelled nut. The pulp is discarded. The heavy bills appear to have evolved specifically to crack open the palm nuts with a chisel-shaped edge, being precisely of the correct size and shape. Upon occasion the birds maw fly off to a better perch to consume the nut, sometimes even carrying a branchlet with a few fruit. Such perches are generally a branch of a tall tree or a cliff face, and the ground below such a perch will become littered with piles of cracked palm nut shells, and are thus easily spotted.

A mystery regarding plants in the Neotropics with very large fruit or seeds is which type of animal disperses the seeds. Elsewhere on earth large herbivorous mammals are the dispersal agents for such plants, but these are largely absent in South America today. The prevailing theory is that such mammals once performed these functions, but that Late Pleistocene extinctions of most of these animals had rendered large-fruited plants impotent regarding the spread of their seed, at least until humans introduced livestock. The &quot;Syagrus coronata&quot; palm, however, may have found a way to avoid such a fate, despite its large nuts. Macaws are very messy eaters, and this species is no different. A study found a significant number of undamaged palm nuts on the ground below the branches or rocks where the birds occasionally carry their harvest.

A method by which the birds may secondarily disperse the nuts is by their habit of coming down to the ground to search out the nuts regurgitated by cattle, which eat the fruit, but usually cough up the large seeds, cleaned of pulp, which often aggregate in areas where the ruminants rest, and some also appear to be viable after this ordeal. Flocks of Lear&#x27;s macaws will congregate at cattle corrals and walk around on the bare ground of rumination sites. After finding one, the regurgitated nut is often eaten on a high perch elsewhere. Cattle also alter the ecosystem by creating open spaces in the environment. It is thus possible that cattle ranching simulates the original ecology of Bahia, before the native megafauna had been wiped out around the time the Native Americans colonised America. Just 11,000 years ago, perhaps these macaws were commensals to one or some of the giant browsing herbivore species of northeast Brazil which traveled in herds, and the palms depended on this relationship for effective dispersal.

Lear&#x27;s macaw are somewhat of a pest species, and a major problem caused by the animals is their habit of raiding the plots of local subsistence farmers to consume maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;). In order to minimize the chagrin of victims and stop them from shooting at the birds, a scheme was implemented in 2005 to compensate farmers for crops lost to the animals with bags of maize from elsewhere. During the COVID epidemic this scheme was halted, because most of the farmers were elderly, but the macaws were not shot, as COVID restrictions prevented farmers from marketing their corn anyway.

===Breeding===
The mating season starts at the beginning of the summer rains, at the start of the year, and extends up to May, when the young begin to fledge and leave the nest. A pair of Lear&#x27;s macaw lay two or three eggs per year. The eggs are incubated for approximately 29 days. Although some pairs produce three chicks, the average survival rate is two per pair. However, not all pairs of birds in the wild population mate often or at all. The young remain with their parents for up to a year. Juveniles reach sexual maturity around 2–4 years of age.

==Distribution and habitat==
For a century and a half after it had been described, the species was only known from sporadic occurrences in the bird trade, and the whereabouts of the wild population was unknown. A wild population was eventually discovered in 1978 by ornithologist Helmut Sick in Bahia in the interior northeast of Brazil. Until this discovery the birds were thought to be simply a variant form of the closely related hyacinth macaw.

Lear&#x27;s macaw roosts on sandstone cliffs, which were formed by streams cutting through outcrops. It is known from two colonies at locations known as Toca Velha and Serra Branca, south of the Raso da Catarina plateau in northeast Bahia. In 1995, a roosting site holding 22 birds was located at Sento Sé/Campo Formoso, to the west.

From these roosts, the macaws travel throughout the region (the municipalities of Campo Formoso, Canudos, Euclides da Cunha, Jeremoabo, Monte Santo, Novo Triunfo, Paulo Afonso, Santa Brígida and Sento Sé), relying on stands of licury palm to find much of their sustenance. This palm stand habitat is thought to have once stretched over in Brazil, but has been much reduced due to clearance for agriculture. Cattle grazing in the palm stands also appear to be damaging and killing the seedlings, thus posing a challenge for the recruitment of new mature palms -such stands were found to have very little young licury palms. In response to this, tens of thousands of palms were propagated and planted in fenced-off areas in the early 2000s.

Lear&#x27;s macaw also requires pre-existing natural cavities found in the sandstone cliffs in which to nest. The availability of such cavities may eventually limit population growth, and thus one group of conservationists advised that more cavities should be excavated artificially.

==Conservation==
===Population and conservation status===
This species is currently listed as an endangered species (CITES I).

Yamashita, one of the first scientists to study this bird in the wild, in 1987 estimated that the global population numbered just 60 birds in 1983. The estimated global population in 1987 was 70 birds. The wild population was surveyed as some 170 individuals in 2000. Based on this, Birdlife International (BI), which has written the IUCN Red List assessments, gave an estimated population of 150 birds in 2000. BI claimed that the population growth was decreasing, but did not elaborate on their reasoning. The global population was censused at 246 birds in 2001 (Gilardi), 455 in 2003, and the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) censused 570 wild birds in 2004. In their 2004 assessment, BI gave a much increased population of 246–280 birds, but continued to claim that the population was decreasing, again without reasoning. Barros counted a total wild population of 630 birds in 2006. In June 2007 Fundação Biodiversitas staff counted 751 individuals. Develey counted a total wild population of 960 birds in 2008. In the 2008 assessment BI countered that earlier surveys undercounted the birds, and that the population was not actually increasing. BI estimated a population of 250–500 mature wild individuals in 2008, arguing that because the population was probably increasing, most of the birds counted by in recent surveys were probably juveniles and therefore did not count as to the total population. BI states that if these juveniles mature over the next few years and the population grows from 250–500 to over 250 individuals, the species would need to be downlisted in the future. The population growth was stated to be uncertain, with BI reasoning that because in the 1990s some 40 birds had been trapped for the pet trade, which had represented a &quot;very rapid decline&quot;, it was unclear if the increasing population was increasing.

BI assessed the species as &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; up to the 2008 assessment, apparently somewhat mistakenly. In 2000, 2004 and 2008 the reason given for it being &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; was because criterion C2a(ii) applied. There is no criterion C2a(ii) for &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; species, but there is for &#x27;endangered&#x27; species. This states that if 95% or more of the population is found in a single subpopulation, and the total population is 2,500 or less, the species should be assessed as endangered. This was not true, it was known that there were two subpopulations, perhaps three since a new discovery of 22 birds at another roosting location in 1995, but BI filled in this information incorrectly in the Population section, despite elaborating on the different subpopulations in the Geographic Range section in the same assessment.

In the 2009 assessment, the conservation status of the species was downgraded to endangered from critically endangered by BI, as it was by now clear that the population was growing rapidly. Despite stating this, BI estimated the population as unchanged since 2008, at 250–500 individuals, claiming most of the rest of the total population were probably sub-adults, and that the population growth was unknown. The species was assessed as endangered based on criteria B1ab(iii), which state that the extent of occurrence was severely fragmented (confusingly, the same assessment states the population is not fragmented) and showed a continuing decline in quality of habitat. In 2010 Barbosa counted the population at the Toca Velha and Serra Branca roosting sites as 1,123 birds, of which at least at least 258 were adults, more than 250. In the 2012 IUCN assessment the estimated population had grown to 250–999 individuals. The population growth was still stated to be uncertain, although the justification given for this was that the population was now clearly increasing rapidly. The number of subpopulations was changed to two. Lugarini &quot;et al&quot;. counted 1,263 birds in 2012. A 2012 count at the unprotected third subpopulation, with roosting sites some 230 kilometres from the main two subpopulations, only found two macaws. The 2013 assessment was basically the same as the 2012 one. The 2016 IUCN assessment continued to give an estimated total population of 250–999 individuals, with the population growth given as uncertain, although it was now clear the population was growing. BI slightly changed the text to state that 228 birds were adults, more than 250, instead of 258. The 2017 assessment is identical to the 2016 one, but includes a map for the first time, showing the roosting areas of the two subpopulations.

In 2014 Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) counted 1,294 birds, this increased to 1,354 in the 2017 ICMBio count, and grew further to 1,694 in the 2018 count. In the 2019 IUCN assessment, BI continued to assert that the population was 250–999 individuals, but now first stated that the population growth was increasing. The map was extended to show the foraging ranges, and not only the roosting sites. The &#x27;Threats&#x27; section was updated to emphasise reduction of food resources due to habitat loss caused by the historical expansion of agricultural development in the region (criterion B1b(iii)). An explanation was also given for reducing the number of mature individuals to 228, a 2014 study published by Pacífico &quot;et al&quot;. This study stated that although the total population size at some 1,125 birds was well known by 2010, it was unknown how many of these birds were actively breeding. During the 2010 season, 114 nests and probable nests were counted. As each nest represents two actively breeding birds, this indicates that 20.3% of the population was actively breeding each season, which is comparable to other similar parrot species. This would also indicate that there were at least 228 mature individuals at the time, assuming maturity was defined as those individuals which were successful at breeding, and would indicate that by 2018, some 340 birds would be reproductively active adults. Of the nests which were monitored, some 80% of the nests showed successful reproduction, which is quite high compared to other parrots.

===Threats===
As well as habitat loss, Lear&#x27;s macaw may have historically suffered from hunting, and more recently, trapping for the aviary trade in the 1990s.

===Funding and conservation actions===

Fundação Biodiversitas bought and created the Canudos Biological Station in 1991 to protect the sandstone cliffs of Toca Velha used by the macaws to roost and nest. Canudos Biological Station was expanded in 2007, partially with funding by the American Bird Conservancy, from to .

Two protected areas, designated by the Brazilian government in 2001, conserve portions of the range: Raso da Catarina Ecological Station (, administered by ICMBio), and Serra Branca / Raso da Catarina Environmental Protection Area (, administered by the Instituto do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hídricos, the state agency of Bahia tasked with the environment). This latter area contains both the privately owned Canudos Biological Station where Toca Velha is located, and the privately owned Serra Branca ranch, which contains the majority of the nest and roost sites.

Current Lear&#x27;s macaw conservation projects are managed under the authority of IBAMA. Various independent conservation organizations, under direction of ICMBio, along with local ranchers, are working to help conserve the species.

In 1992 the &#x27;Special Working Group for the Preservation of the Lear&#x27;s Macaw&#x27; was created. In 1997 the &#x27;Committee for the Preservation of the Lear&#x27;s Macaw (&quot;Anodorhynchus leari&quot;)&#x27; was formed. In 1999 this committee was amalgamated with that of &quot;A. hyacinthinus&quot; and was renamed &#x27;The Committee for the Recovery and Management of the &quot;Anodorhynchus leari&quot; Lear&#x27;s Macaw and &quot;Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus&quot; Hyacinth Macaw&#x27;. The &#x27;Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Lear&#x27;s Macaw&#x27; advises IBAMA on the conservation of Lear&#x27;s macaw. The committee includes Brazilian and international organizations and individuals.

==Aviculture==
One of the earliest records (and one of very few at all) of a Lear&#x27;s macaw in a public zoo was a dramatic display of &quot;the four blues&quot; including Lear&#x27;s, glaucous, hyacinth, and Spix&#x27;s macaws in 1900 at the Berlin Zoo.

According to the World Parrot Trust, the Lear&#x27;s macaw is currently extremely rare in captivity and may live for 60 years, whereas the Animal Ageing and Longevity Database cites the maximum recorded longevity for a captive Lear&#x27;s macaw at 38.3 years. It is recommended that this parrot be kept in an enclosure of 15 metres in length.

<text>Neferkare Shabaka, or Shabako (Egyptian: 𓆷𓃞𓂓 &quot;šꜣ bꜣ kꜣ&quot;, Assyrian: &quot;Ša-ba-ku-u&quot;, Šabakû ) was the third Kushite pharaoh of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from 705 to 690 BC. The Greek sources called him Sabakōn (Σαβακῶν) or, more likely, given current understanding of the order of kings and the stated reign-lengths, Sebikhōs (Σεβιχὼς), and is mentioned by both Herodotus and Manetho.

==Shabaka&#x27;s timeline==
The archaeological evidence now in 2016–2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman&#x27;s GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka&#x27;s NLR #30&#x27;s Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand side of the lower edge of Shebitku&#x27;s NLR#33 Year 3 inscription. This can only mean that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku. The Egyptologist Claus Jurman&#x27;s personal re-examination of the Karnak quay inscriptions of Shebitku (or Shabataka) and Shabaka in 2016 and 2017 conclusively demonstrate that Shebitku ruled before Shabaka and corroborates Broekman&#x27;s arguments that Shebitku&#x27;s Nile Text inscription was carved before Shabaka&#x27;s inscription; hence, Shebitku ruled before Shabaka.

Critically, Frédéric Payraudeau writes in French that &quot;the Divine Adoratrix or God&#x27;s Wife of Amun Shepenupet I, the last Libyan Adoratrix, was still alive during the reign of Shebitku because she is represented performing rites and is described as &quot;living&quot; in those parts of the Osiris-Héqadjet chapel built during his reign (wall and exterior of the gate) In the rest of the room, it is Amenirdis I, Shabaka&#x27;s sister), who is represented with the Adoratrix title and provided with a coronation name. The succession Shepenupet I—Amenirdis I as God&#x27;s Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratrix thus took place during the reign of Shebitku. This detail in itself is sufficient to show that the reign of Shabaka cannot precede that of Shebitku.

The construction of the tomb of Shebitku (Ku. 18) resembles that of Piye (Ku. 17) while that of Shabaka (Ku. 15) is similar to that of Taharqa (Nu. 1) and Tantamani (Ku. 16). This also favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession in the 25th dynasty. One of the strongest evidence that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku was demonstrated by the architectural features of the Kushite royal pyramids in El Kurru. Only in the pyramids of Piye (Ku 17) and Shebitku (Ku 18) are the burial-chambers open-cut structures with a corbelled roof, whereas fully tunnelled burial chamber substructures are found in the pyramids of Shabaka (Ku 15), Taharqa (Nu 1) and Tantamani (Ku 16), as well as with all subsequent royal pyramids in El Kurru and Nuri. The fully tunnelled and once decorated burial chamber of Shabaka&#x27;s pyramid was clearly an architectural improvement since it was followed by Taharqa and all his successors. The pyramid design evidence also shows that Shabaka must have ruled after—and not before—Shebitku.

In the Cairo CG 42204 of the High Priest of Amun, Haremakhet—son of Shabaka—calls himself as &quot;king&#x27;s son of Shabaka, justified, who loves him, Sole Confidant of king Taharqa, justified, Director of the palace of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Tanutamun/Tantamani, may he live for ever.&quot; However, no mention of Haremakhet&#x27;s service under Shebitku is made; even if Haremakhet was only a youth under Shebitku, this king&#x27;s absence is strange since the intent of the statue&#x27;s text was to render a chronological sequence of kings who reigned during Horemakhet&#x27;s life, each of their names being accompanied by a reference to the relationship that existed between the king mentioned and Horemakhet. This implies that when Haremakhet was born, king Shebitku was already dead, which would favour a Shebitku-Shabaka succession.
Payraudeau notes that Shebitku&#x27;s shabtis are small (about 10 cm) and have a very brief inscription with only the king&#x27;s birth name in a cartouche preceded by &quot;the Osiris, king of Upper and Lower Egypt&quot; and followed by mȝʿ-ḫrw. They are thus very close to those of Piye/Piankhy [42 – D. Dunham, (see footnote 39), plate 44.]. However, Shabaka&#x27;s shabtis are larger (about 15–20 cm) with more developed inscriptions, including the quotation from the Book of the Dead, which is also present on those Taharqo, Tanouetamani and Senkamanisken.&quot; All this evidence suggests that Shebitku ruled before Shabaka. Additionally, Payraudeau observes that in the traditional Shabaka-Shebitku arrangement, the time span between the reign of Taharqa and Shabaka would be excessively long. He notes that Papyrus Louvre E 3328c from Year 2 or Year 6 of Taharqa mentions the sale of a slave by his owner who had bought him in Year 7 of Shabaka, that is 27 years earlier in the traditional chronology but if the reign of Shabaka is placed just before that of Taharqa (with no intervening reign of Shebitku), there is a gap of about 10 years which is much more credible.

The German scholar Karl Jansen Winkeln also endorsed a Shebitku-Shabaka succession in a JEH 10 (2017) N.1 paper titled &#x27;Beiträge zur Geschichte der Dritten Zwischenzeit&#x27;, Journal of Egyptian History 10 (2017), pp. 23–42 when he wrote a postscript stating &quot;Im Gegensatz zu meinen Ausführungen auf dem [2014] Kolloquium in Münster bin ich jetzt der Meinung, dass die (neue) Reihenfolge Schebitku—Schabako in der Tat richtig ist...&quot; or &#x27;In contrast to my exposition at the [2014] Munster colloquium, I am now of the opinion that the (new) succession Shebitku-Shabako is in fact correct...&#x27;

==Family==

Shabaka is thought to be the son of King Kashta and Pebatjma, although a text from the time of Taharqa could be interpreted to mean that Shabaka was a brother of Taharqa and hence a son of Piye.

Shabaka&#x27;s Queen Consort was Qalhata, according to Assyrian records, a sister of Taharqa. Shabaka and Qalhata were the parents of King Tantamani and possibly the parents of King Shebitku as well, but this conflicts with evidence in favor of Shabaka ruling after Shebitku.

It is possible that Queen Tabekenamun was a wife of Shabaka. She is thought by some to be a wife of Taharqa.

Shabaka&#x27;s son Haremakhet became High Priest of Amun and is known from a statue and a fragment of a statue found in Karnak. A lady named Mesbat is mentioned on the sarcophagus of Haremakhet and may be his mother.

Shabaka is the father of at least two more children, but the identity of their mother is not known. Piankharty later became the wife of her (half-)brother Tantamani. She is depicted on the Dream Stela with him. Isetemkheb H likely married Tantamani as well. She was buried in Abydos, Egypt.

==Biography==

Shabaka succeeded his uncle Shebitku on the throne, and adopted the throne name of the Sixth Dynasty ruler Pepi II Neferkare. Shabaka&#x27;s reign was initially dated from 716 BC to 702 BC by Kenneth Kitchen. However, new evidence indicates that Shebitku died around 705 BC because Sargon II (722–705 BC) of Assyria states in an official inscription at Tang-i Var (in northwest Iran)—which is datable to 706 BC—that it was Shebitku, Shabaka&#x27;s predecessor, who extradited Iamanni of Ashdod to Shebitku as king of Egypt. This view has been accepted by many Egyptologists today such as Aidan Dodson, Rolf Krauss, David Aston, and among others because there is no concrete evidence for coregencies or internal political/regional divisions in the Nubian kingdom during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. This point was also stressed by Dan&#x27;el Kahn in a 2006 article. All contemporary records suggest that the Nubian Pharaohs ruled Egypt with only a single king on the throne, while Taharqa states explicitly on one of his Kawa steles that he assumed power only after the death of his brother, Shebitku.

Shabaka&#x27;s reign is significant because he consolidated the Nubian Kingdom&#x27;s control over all of Egypt from Nubia down to the Delta region. It also saw an enormous amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In Karnak he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the twin crowns of Egypt. Shabaka succeeded in preserving Egypt&#x27;s independence from outside foreign powers—especially the Neo-Assyrian Empire of Sargon II. The most famous relic from Shabaka&#x27;s reign is the Shabaka Stone which records several Old Kingdom documents that the king ordered preserved.

Also notable is the Shabaka Gate, a large stone door unearthed by archeologists in 2011 and believed to have guarded the room where the king&#x27;s treasures were stored. Despite being relative newcomers to Egypt, Shabaka and his family were immensely interested in Egypt&#x27;s past and the art of the period reflects their tastes which harked back to earlier periods.

==Death==
Shabaka is assumed to have died in his 15th regnal year based on BM cube statue 24429, which is dated to Year 15, II Shemu day 11 of Shabaka&#x27;s reign. Shabaka was buried in a pyramid at el-Kurru and was succeeded by Taharqa, who would be his nephew if Shabaka was indeed a son of Kashta.

<doc id="1126152" wikidata="Q2370689" url="?curid=1126152" title="Blues Saraceno">
<text>Blues Saraceno (born October 17, 1971) is an American rock guitarist, composer and music producer, currently residing in Los Angeles, California. He was discovered by &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; magazine at the age of 16, which assisted him in releasing instrumental recordings on an independent basis.

Saraceno&#x27;s high profile as a gifted guitar virtuoso and musician opened the doors to an early career as a first-call guitar sideman and session musician. Saraceno is most often recognized from his time playing with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker (Cream) as well as his brief tenure with the rock band Poison. Saraceno&#x27;s early success in the music industry would eventually blossom into a career in producing and composing for television and film.

==Early life and career==
Blues Saraceno was born to musician parents, who introduced him at an early age to several musical instruments. He started to play guitar at the age of nine. When he was thirteen, he broke his elbow when he fell from a go-kart and asked the doctor to position the cast in a way that allowed him to remove it from his sling to practice guitar during his recovery. When he was nineteen, Saraceno moved to Los Angeles to seek a career in music.

==Career==
When Saraceno was still a teenager, his manager sent a demo tape to singer Michael Bolton, who decided to enlist him to play on a song for Cher&#x27;s album, &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;. The album also featured musicians like Peter Cetera, Bonnie Tyler, Desmond Child, and others. His demo tape then reached the &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; magazine. The magazine, which was about to launch a new record label, offered Saraceno a record deal. Saraceno released his first album titled &quot;Never Look Back&quot; in 1989.

Saraceno won an audition with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, former members of Cream, and started touring with them. After two successful US tours, Saraceno was sometimes referred to as the &quot;kid that replaced Eric Clapton&quot;. After another year of overseas touring, Baker departed and was replaced by Simon Phillips (Who, Toto) and eventually Gary Husband (Level 42). Saraceno released two other solo albums (&quot;Plaid&quot; and &quot;Hairpick&quot;) as well as furthering his reputation as a top call session guitarist and landing many high-profile equipment endorsements.

In 1993, Saraceno joined the band Poison as lead guitarist and songwriter after Richie Kotzen was fired. After a South American tour which included the famous Hollywood rock festival in Brazil, Saraceno recorded the album &quot;Crack a Smile&quot; with the band. However, Capitol Records decided to shelve the album, releasing the 1996 compilation album, &quot;Poison&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 1986–1996&quot;, instead. Still, the album featured two of the new songs recorded with Saraceno.

After some time, Saraceno left the group amicably and was replaced by one of the band&#x27;s former guitarist, C.C. DeVille. In 2000, Capitol finally decided to release the &quot;Crack a Smile&quot; album under the name &quot;Crack a Smile... and More!&quot;. The album features fifteen tracks recorded by Saraceno.

After his departure from Poison, Saraceno met the vice-president of Advertising of Fox Television, who was a fan of Saraceno&#x27;s earlier instrumental work. This resulted in Saraceno working on soundtracks and songs for several television shows and films.

In 2000, Saraceno founded the band, Transmission OK. Saraceno also worked as record producer for the band, which was signed to Beyond Records, and was distributed by BMG. After a brief US tour, and lackluster support from the label, the group disbanded and Saraceno continued to work on television and film, as well as his session work.

Saraceno&#x27;s has done session work with everyone from Ziggy Marley (&quot;Dragonfly&quot;) to Melissa Etheridge (&quot;Lucky&quot;), earning him a reputation for being a &quot;go-to guy&quot; for many of Los Angeles&#x27; top record producers and engineers.

Saraceno has also produced for artists including Scott Caan (&quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, &quot;Oceans 11&quot;), Eric Balfour (&quot;24&quot;, Haven, &quot;Chainsaw Massacre&quot;) of Fredalba, Lindsay Price (&quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;) and Anthony Michael Hall (&quot;Dead Zone&quot;).

Saraceno&#x27;s greatest success has come in the field of television and film. His television work credits include WWE, CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, Disney, Discovery, UPN, MTV, MTV 2, VH1, USA, TLC, Comedy Central, Telemundo, SCI FI, SPIKE, E! and BRAVO. A more detailed list can be found on his website (www.bluessaraceno.com). He has commented on how it is not uncommon to have several commercials running in different countries throughout the world, all at the same time, using the same piece of music.

Saraceno did three tracks for Megas XLR. These tracks were Blood Shot, Berzerker and Ro-Sham-Bo.

Saraceno&#x27;s &quot;Save My Soul&quot; is the soundtrack for the History Channel&#x27;s mini-series &quot;The Men Who Built America.&quot;

Saraceno&#x27;s &quot;Evil Ways&quot; song was also used in various videogames trailers such as &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot;, &quot;Call of Juarez: Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;&#x27;s zombies mode map, Mob of the Dead and was also included in the soundtrack for a videogame &quot;Rebel Galaxy&quot;. In addition, the song was also utilized to promote AMC&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Fear Fest&quot; and is also used as the main theme music in the History Channel&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Biker Battleground Phoenix&quot;.

TNA wrestler AJ Styles began using &quot;Evil Ways&quot; at TNA&#x27;s Slammiversary pay-per-view on June 2, 2013, as his new theme song. It was also used in a WWE promo featuring The Undertaker vs. CM Punk WrestleMania XXIX match and another promo featuring The Wyatt Family in an episode of &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;.

It was also used during a promo for Kane, Ryback and Big Show vs. The Wyatt Family at WWE&#x27;s Fastlane 2016 pay-per-view. German TV-Channel ProSieben and sister-channel ProSieben Maxx are using the song for almost every promo-clip for upcoming western-movies in their program. &quot;Flesh It Out&quot; was used as WWE rookie Seth Rollins&#x27; theme tune for the first year of his career on FCW and NXT. &quot;Strident Missile&quot; was used for Triple H&#x27;s history of dominance promo for WrestleMania XXX. An instrumental version of the dubstep remix of &quot;The River&quot; was used for Emma&#x27;s video packages leading up to her return at the post-Wrestlemania RAW in 2017. WWE also used his single &quot;Bad Man&quot; for Jeff Jarrett&#x27;s Hall of Fame video.

<text>Makybe Diva (foaled 21 March 1999) is a champion Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who is the only horse to win three Melbourne Cups and the only mare to win it more than once. She achieved the feat in 2003, 2004, and 2005. She also won the 2005 Cox Plate. She was the highest stakes-earner in Australian history, winning more than A$14 million. 

She is by Desert King (a winner of the Irish Derby and Irish 2,000 Guineas) out of Tugela by Riverman (USA). Tugela was also the dam of the Australian stakes-winners, Musket and Valkyrie Diva. Makybe Diva is owned by South Australian tuna fisherman Tony Šantić, who named her after five of his employees—Maureen, Kylie, Belinda, Diane, and Vanessa—by taking the first two letters from each of their names.

==Background==
Tony Šantić&#x27;s bloodstock agent John Foote purchased Tugela in foal to Desert King for 60,000 guineas at the December 1998 Tattersall&#x27;s Sale. As normally happens with Santic&#x27;s British-purchased horses, she was taken to Dick Fowlston&#x27;s Britton House Stud in Somerset to board before being sent on to Australia. Tugela gave birth to a filly at five minutes past midnight on 21 March 1999. The filly was offered for sale at the 1999 Tatts Newmarket foal sale, but did not make the reserve. Named Makybe Diva, the filly remained at Britton House Stud until August 2000, when she and Tugela were shipped to Australia.

==Racing career==
===2002: Three-Year-Old Season===
Originally trained by David Hall, Makybe Diva made her racetrack debut in late July 2002, as a three-year-old, in a maiden at Benalla, Victoria, and finished fourth.

===2002/2003: Four-Year-Old Season===
In her next start two weeks later—and now classed as a four-year-old—Makybe Diva began a six-race winning sequence in a maiden at Wangaratta, which culminated in stakes wins, three months later, in the Werribee Cup (2,000 m) and the Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2,500 m). The last win was significant in that it qualified the mare for the following year&#x27;s Melbourne Cup and allowed her trainer to give her a light autumn campaign, which consisted of just two starts in relatively short races.
Makybe Diva&#x27;s early career was unusual in that she was unable to contest any major races against horses of her own age, such as the VRC Oaks, because she was foaled in the U.K. to the Northern Hemisphere breeding calendar. This meant that, for Australian racing purposes, where horses &quot;age-up&quot; on 1 August each year, she was bracketed with horses foaled about six months earlier, in the Southern Hemisphere spring.

===2003/2004: Five-Year-Old Season (Melbourne Cup 1)===
Makybe Diva resumed racing in the spring over , but while being reasonably competitive, she did not win any major races. Second up at her next start in the Group 3 Stock Stakes, she came from behind to finish fourth, beaten by just over two lengths. She then started 5:1 equal favourite in the Group 2 Turnbull Stakes, where she again raced at the back of the field, before finishing fourth, beaten by only one length.

After finishing as a 14-1 outsider in the Caulfield Cup, she began her partnership with Sydney jockey Glen Boss. Coming from near last with to go in the 2400-m race, she finished fourth behind the Lee Freedman-trained Mummify. The first Tuesday in November 2003 was her first Melbourne Cup victory. Starting as an $8 second favourite, Makybe Diva raced at the back of the field until the finishing straight, where jockey Boss picked his way through the field to win by lengths. 

In the autumn of 2004, she resumed over 1400 m (7 furlongs) carrying 59.5 kg followed by a third-place finish in the Group 3 Carlyon Cup. Following this, she was blocked when making a winning run in the Australian Cup before being taken to Sydney, where she placed third in the Ranvet Stakes and The BMW Stakes, both Group 1 races. The Group 1 Sydney Cup over 3200 m (2 mi) was to be her final run for the campaign. Sent out as a $3.50 second favourite, she began off the pace, but ran home to record a win by half a length, becoming the first mare to ever win the Sydney Cup/Melbourne Cup double in the same season, and only the fourth horse to have accomplished the double win.

After the 2003–2004 season, trainer David Hall left to train in Hong Kong, and Makybe Diva was transferred to trainer Lee Freedman, generally regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s top trainers.

===2004/2005: Six-Year-Old Season (Melbourne Cup 2)===
Her campaign in the spring of 2004 was aimed at winning the Melbourne Cup for a second time. It followed the pattern of her previous cup-winning campaign, though she appeared to be racing better than before. A close second in the Group 2 John F Feehan Stakes over at Moonee Valley showed her competitiveness in shorter races. In the 2004 Caulfield Cup, Makybe Diva drew barrier 18 and settled at the back of the field. She was narrowly defeated by Elvstroem, who led all the way.

Makybe Diva was sent out a $3.60 favourite, and won the 2004 Melbourne Cup. In driving rain, the mare defeated a field featuring multiple Irish St. Leger winner Vinnie Roe, Caulfield Cup winners Mummify and Elvstroem, Mamool from the Godolphin stable, and the 2002 Melbourne Cup winner Media Puzzle.

Resuming racing in February, Makybe Diva put in close finishes behind Elvstroem in both the C F Orr Stakes and St George Stakes, at Caulfield. On 12 March, she won the Australian Cup, a weight for age event over , and in the process broke the Australian record and set an unofficial world record for 2000 m on turf. She proceeded to win Sydney&#x27;s most important WFA race, the BMW Stakes, with a last-to-first burst. In April and May, she raced in Japan, where she failed in two starts, the latter of which was over in the Group One &quot;Tenno Sho&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s Cup).

Makybe Diva was named Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year for the 2004/05 season. Along with this, she was also named Australian Champion Stayer and Australian Champion Filly and Mare. A three-quarter brother to Makybe Diva, by Redoute&#x27;s Choice, was sold in April 2005 for an Australian record price of $2.5 million. Subsequently, named Musket, the colt won his debut at Canterbury in August 2006, and in 2008 won the Gr.2 Shannon Stakes at Rosehill.

===2005/2006: Seven-Year-Old Season (Melbourne Cup 3)===
Resuming racing in August 2005, Makybe Diva won the Group 2 Memsie Stakes first up, before being defeated by a nose in the Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes at Moonee Valley. Two weeks later, with a run down the outside of the field, Makybe Diva won the Turnbull Stakes over 2,000 m at Flemington. The mare further enhanced her reputation despite being eight horses wide on the home turn, with a comfortable victory in the 2005 Cox Plate, subsequently beating 2006 winner Fields of Omagh.

Prior to the Melbourne Cup, whether Makybe Diva would start was in doubt, after her connections said she would not run if the track was &quot;too firm&quot;. After the VRC decided to water the track, however, she was declared a starter. On 1 November 2005, she made history in winning a record third Melbourne Cup. Settling towards the back of the field, she steadily made ground between runners around the home turn, before hitting the lead with around 300 m to go and holding a comfortable 1-1/4-length margin at the finish. Immediately after the race, trainer Lee Freedman said: 

The win was not without controversy, however. Many, including rival trainers, suggested the track watering amounted to bad sportsmanship employed to give Makybe Diva the best chance to win the race. However, the track condition was upgraded to good straight after the Cup, and the winning time of 3:19.18 was consistent with that rating.

Makybe Diva carried 58 kg during the record third Melbourne Cup, 0.5 kg above the weight-for-age scale for a mare in a 3200m race. The last horse to carry more than weight-for-age and win was Rain Lover, who was 1 kg over when he won his second cup in 1969, with 60.5 kg. In 2005, Makybe Diva broke her own weight-carrying record for a mare of 55.5 kg, which she set in 2004, and became the highest-weighted winner of the Cup since Think Big won his second Melbourne Cup with 58.5 kg in 1975. During the presentation of the Melbourne Cup, owner Tony Šantić announced that Makybe Diva would &quot;retire from racing as of today&quot;.

At the end of the 2005–06 season, Makybe Diva was named Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year for the second time, becoming just the third horse to win that accolade more than once. She was also named Australian Champion Stayer, winning this award for the third consecutive year, as well as Australian Champion Middle Distance Racehorse.

==Breeding career==
On 10 August 2006, it was announced that Makybe Diva would be served by Epsom Derby winner Galileo at Coolmore Stud.

At 3:16 on the morning of 17 August 2007, AEST time, Makybe Diva gave birth to her first foal, named Rockstardom, at Coolmore Stud in the Hunter Valley of NSW. Sold for AU$1.5 million as a yearling in 2009, he won two races in 12 starts, earning $26,115 over three years. Rockstardom was gelded and died of a skull fracture in his stall at C. Waller&#x27;s stables on 26 July 2013.

Makybe Diva was due to be served by Encosta De Lago in the spring of 2007 until the outbreak of equine influenza forced the stud to be quarantined. Owner Tony Šantić sent the Diva to American champion Fusaichi Pegasus, instead. On 20 August 2008, Makybe gave birth to her second foal, a filly by the aforementioned Fusaichi Pegasus. This filly, later named La Dolce Diva, sold at auction for $1.2 million to trainer Mark Kavanagh of Melbourne. Makybe Diva had a colt on 28 August 2009 by Encosta De Lago and was covered by More Than Ready for the 2010 season, but she did not produce a foal in 2010.

Makybe Diva gave birth to her fourth foal, a bay colt by Lonhro, on 16 August 2011 in Victoria. Her fifth foal, born in September 2012, is a colt sired by High Chaparral.

==Awards==
In 2006, the inaugural Spirit of Sport Award (for 2005) was given to Makybe Diva and her connections (Lee Freedman, Tony Šantić, and Glen Boss) by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame for her three successive Melbourne Cups. Spirit of Sport Award site

On 4 July 2006, Makybe Diva was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

As announced on 5 August 2006, Makybe Diva has been honoured at Flemington Racecourse with a life-sized bronze statue, in recognition of her historic three Melbourne Cup wins. A life-sized bronze statue was also erected on the foreshore in Šantić&#x27;s home town of Port Lincoln, South Australia.

Makybe Diva headed the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities ratings for the 2005-06 official end-of-season assessment. She was given a rating of 124, ahead of Electrocutionist, David Junior. and Heart&#x27;s Cry on 123. At a ceremony in Melbourne on 5 September 2010, held in conjunction with the Australian Horse of the Year awards, Makybe Diva was officially inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

==Race Record==




==Pedigree==

* Makybe Diva is inbred 4 × 4 x 4 to the stallion Northern Dancer, meaning that Northern Dancer appears three times in the fourth generation of her pedigree. In turn, this means she has six great-great-grandsires instead of eight.

<text>Microsoft Project is a project management software product, developed and sold by Microsoft. It is designed to assist a project manager in developing a schedule, assigning resources to tasks, tracking progress, managing the budget, and analyzing workloads.

Microsoft Project was the company&#x27;s third Microsoft Windows-based application. Within a few years after its launch, it became the dominant PC-based project management software. From 2015 to 2020 it was the most popular application for project management according to Project Management Zone.

It is part of the Microsoft 365 family but has never been included in any of the suites of Microsoft Office or Microsoft 365. It is available currently as a cloud-based solution with three price levels (Plan 1, Plan 3, or Plan 5): or as a on-premises solution with three editions (Standard, Professional, and Server). Microsoft Project&#x27;s proprietary file format is &quot;.mpp.&quot;

Microsoft Project and Microsoft Project Server are the cornerstones of the Microsoft Office enterprise project management (EPM) product.

== History ==
&#x27;Project&#x27; was an MS-DOS software application originally written in C (and some assembly) language for the IBM PC. The idea originated with Ron Bredehoeft, a former IBM S/E and PC enthusiast in the early 1980s, as a prank to express the recipe and all preparation for a breakfast of eggs Benedict in project management terms. Bredehoeft formed his own company, Microsoft Application Services (MAS) Consulting while creating Project, and the company later entered an OEM agreement with Microsoft Corporation. Alan M. Boyd, Microsoft&#x27;s Manager of Product Development, introduced the application as an internal tool to help manage the huge number of software projects that were in development at any time inside the company. Boyd wrote the specification and engaged a local Seattle company to develop the prototype.

The first commercial version of Project was released for DOS in 1984. Microsoft bought all rights to the software in 1985 and released version 2. Version 3 for DOS was released in 1986. Version 4 for DOS was the final DOS version, released in 1986. The first Windows version was released in 1990, and was labelled version 1 for Windows.

In 1991 a Macintosh version was released. Development continued until Microsoft Project 4.0 for Mac in 1993. Microsoft Project 4 for the Mac included both 68k and PowerMac versions, Visual Basic for Applications and integration with Microsoft office 4.2 for the Mac. In 1994, Microsoft stopped development of most of its Mac applications and did not offer a new version of Office until 1998, after the creation of the new Microsoft Macintosh Business Unit the year prior. The Mac Business Unit never released an updated version of Project, and the last version does not run natively on macOS.

Microsoft Project 1.0 was the only version to support Windows 2.x (Windows 2.0 and Windows 2.1x). It came bundled with Windows 2.x runtime but was fully compatible with Windows 3.0, especially Standard and Enhanced modes. The setup program runs in DOS, like most Windows-based applications at the time.

Microsoft Project 3.0 introduced macro support, toolbars, print preview, DDE and OLE support, spell checking, Resource Allocation view and Planning Wizards and was the last to support Windows 3.0. The setup program now runs in Windows, and it is based on Microsoft&#x27;s own setup program, which was also used by e.g. Microsoft Visual Basic 2.0/3.0, Works 2.0, Access 1.x.

Microsoft Project 4.0 was the first to use common Office menus, right-click context menus, Acme setup program and the last to support Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5. It was the last 16-bit version. Additionally it was the first version to use VBA macro language and introduced screen tooltips, Cue Cards, GanttChartWizard, Calendar view, Assign Resources dialog, recurring tasks, workgroup abilities, Drawing toolbar, Microsoft Project Exchange file format support, OLE 2.0 and ability to create reports. This version allowed user to consolidate up to 80 projects.

Microsoft Project 95 (4.1) was the first 32-bit version and it was designed for Windows 95, hence the name even though some components such as the welcome tour, help components etc. remained 16-bit. It introduced ODBC support, AutoCorrect, Answer Wizard, like all Office 95 applications. Updated version, called Microsoft Project 4.1a improved Windows NT support. Additionally it was the first version to be available on CD-ROM. Additionally it was the last version to open Project 3.0 files.

Microsoft Project 98 was fully 32-bit, and the first to use Tahoma font in the menu bars, to contain Office Assistant, like all Office 97 applications, introduced view bar, AutoFilter, task splitting, Assignment Information dialog, resource availability dates, project status date, user-entered actual costs, new task types, multiple critical paths, in-sheet controls, ability to rename custom fields, Web publishing features, new database format, Task Usage, Tracking Gantt and Resource Usage views, Web features, Web toolbar, PERT analysis features, resource contouring, cost rate tables, effort-driven scheduling, cross-project linking, indicators, progress lines, ability to save project files in HTML format, ability to analyze time-scaled data in Excel, improved limits for the number of tasks, resources, outline levels etc., IntelliMouse and Microsoft Office Binder support, Microsoft Outlook timeline integration, selective data import and export, ability to save as Microsoft Excel pivot tables, Microsoft Project Map, Project menu and allowed user to consolidate 1,000 projects. It was the last version to run on Windows NT 3.51, the last to open Project 4.0/95 files and save in .mpx (Microsoft Project Exchange) file format, the last to use Acme setup program and the last to be available on floppy disks. Project 98 SR-1 was a major service release addressing several issues in Project 98.

Microsoft Project 2000 was the first to use personalized menus, Microsoft Agent-based Office Assistant and to use Windows Installer-based setup interface, like all Office 2000 applications, and introduced Microsoft Project Central (later renamed Microsoft Project Server). PERT Chart was renamed Network Diagram and was greatly improved in this version. Notable new features include ability to create personal Gantt charts, ability to apply filters in Network Diagram view, AutoSave, task calendars, ability to create projects based on templates and to specify default save path and format, graphical indicators, material resources, deadline dates, OLE DB, grouping, outline codes, estimated durations, month duration, value lists and formulas custom fields, contoured resource availability, ability to clear baseline, variable row height, in-cell editing, fill handle, ability to set fiscal year in timescale, single document interface, accessibility features, COM add-ins, pluggable language user interface, roaming user and Terminal Services support, ability to set task and project priority up to 1,000 (previously 10) and HTML help. Project 2000 was also the last version to support Find Fast (available in Windows 9x and NT 4.0 only) and to run on Windows 95. Project 2000 SR-1 fixed several bugs.

Microsoft Project 2002 was the first to contain task panes, safe mode, smart tags, import/setup tracking/new project/calendar/import and export mapping wizards, ability to import tasks from Outlook and to save multiple baselines along with additional baseline fields, Project Guide, EPM/portfolio features (Professional only), Excel task list template, rollup baseline data to summary tasks on a selective baseline save, ability to choose which baseline the earned value calculations are based on, calculation options, multiple project manager support (Project Server is required), Collaborate menu, &quot;Type a question for help&quot; in the top right corner, error reporting along with mandatory product activation, like Office XP and Windows XP and ability to open and save Microsoft Project Data Interchange (.mspdi) files. It was also the last version to run on Windows NT 4.0, 98 (SE) and ME. It was available in two editions for the first time, &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot;. Office Assistant is installed but not enabled by default. Support for accounts with limited rights under Windows 2000/XP was improved. Find Fast was dropped in favor of Windows 2000/XP Indexing Service.

Microsoft Project 2003 was the first to support Windows XP visual styles and to contain SharePoint support, XML importing/printing/Copy Picture to Office wizards, built-in Office Online help, ability to create WBS charts in Visio, add-in for comparing projects (available as a freely downloadable add-on for Project 2000 and 2002), resource availability graphs, ability to import resource information from Active Directory and Exchange address book, Windows XP-style icons, like all Office 2003 applications, and the last to contain Office Assistant (not installed by default) and to run on Windows 2000 (Service Pack 3 required).

Microsoft Project 2007 was the last to contain the menu bar and toolbars. New features include top level budget planning, multiple level undo, ability to manage non-working time, background cell highlighting, cost/team resources, change highlighting, visual reports, desktop OLAP cube and Report menu. Office Assistant was removed entirely.

Microsoft Project 2010 was the first to contain ribbon and Backstage view, like all Office 2010 applications, contextual guidance, ability to zoom in/out quickly, user-controlled scheduling, top down summary tasks, placeholder text in project fields, timeline view, ability to add columns dynamically, text wrap, expanded color palette and formatting, task inspector, schedule warnings, ability to save as PDF or XPS and to synchronize with SharePoint, enhanced copy/pase and the last to open Microsoft Project 98 and .mpx files and to run on Windows XP and Vista. Additionally it was the first 64-bit version. Volume licensing activation was introduced in this version.

Microsoft Project 2013 was the first to contain Modern UI-based look, and introduced Microsoft account and OneDrive integration. New features include integrated communication (Skype for Business is required).

Microsoft Project 2016 is the last to support Windows 7 and Windows 8(.1). New features include multiple timeline view, Tell Me, colorful/dark gray/white themes, resource engagements, resource manager views, resource capacity heat maps, ability to give feedback directly to Microsoft in the File tab.

Microsoft Project 2019 runs only on Windows 10, and it contains features carried over from Office 365. New features include ability to link tasks using a drop-down menu, Task Summary Name field, timeline bar labels and task progress, accessibility improvements.

Versions for Windows were released in 1990 (v1.0), 1992 (v3.0), 1993 (v4.0), 1995 (Project 95, v4.1a), Project 98 (v8.0), Project 98 SR-1 (1999), Project 2000 (v9.0), Project 2000 SR-1 (2001), Project 2002 (v10.0), Project 2003 (v11.0), Project 2007 (v12.0), Project 2010 (v14.0), Project 2013 (v15.0) and Project 2016 (v16.0). There was no Version 2 on the Windows platform; the original design spec was augmented with the addition of macro capabilities and the extra work required to support a macro language pushed the development schedule out to early 1992 (Version 3).

== Features ==

The project creates budgets based on assignment work and resource rates. As resources are assigned to tasks and assignment work estimated, the program calculates the cost, equal to the work times the rate, which rolls up to the task level and then to any summary tasks and finally to the project level. Resource definitions (people, equipment and materials) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool. Each resource can have its own calendar, which defines what days and shifts a resource is available. Resource rates are used to calculate resource assignment costs which are rolled up and summarized at the resource level. Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources, and the application schedules task work based on the resource availability as defined in the resource calendars. All resources can be defined in label without limit. Therefore, it cannot determine how many finished products can be produced with a given amount of raw materials. This makes Microsoft Project unsuitable for solving problems of available materials constrained production. Additional software is necessary to manage a complex facility that produces physical goods.

The application creates critical path schedules, and critical chain and event chain methodology third-party add-ons also are available. Schedules can be resource leveled, and chains are visualized in a Gantt chart. Additionally, Microsoft Project can recognize different classes of users. These different classes of users can have differing access levels to projects, views, and other data. Custom objects such as calendars, views, tables, filters, and fields are stored in an enterprise global which is shared by all users.

=== Editions ===
As of 2021, Project is available in two editions, Standard and Professional; both editions are available either as 32 or 64-bit options. The Professional edition includes all the features of the Standard version, plus more features like team collaboration tools and the ability to connect to Microsoft Project Server.

===Project 2010===

Microsoft Project 2010 includes the Fluent user interface known as the Ribbon.

; Interoperability: Microsoft Project&#x27;s capabilities were extended with the introduction of Microsoft Office Project Server and Microsoft Project Web Access. Project Server stores Project data in a central SQL-based database, allowing multiple, independent projects to access a shared resource pool. Web Access allows authorized users to access a Project Server database across the Internet, and includes timesheets, graphical analysis of resource workloads, and administrative tools.
; User-controlled scheduling: User-controlled scheduling offers flexible choices for developing and managing projects.
;Timeline: The timeline view allows the user to build a basic Visio-style graphical overview of the project schedule. The view can be copied and pasted into PowerPoint, Word, or any other application.
;SharePoint 2010 list synchronization: SharePoint Foundation and Project Professional project task status updates may be synchronized for team members.
;Inactive tasks: helps experiment with project plans and perform what-if analysis
;The Team Planner view: The new Team Planner shows resources and work overtime, and helps spot problems and resolve issues.

===Project 2013===

What&#x27;s new in Project 2013 includes new Reports section, better integration with other Microsoft products, and appearance of user interface items:

; Reports: A Reports section is added to the ribbon for pre-installed reports. Project 2013 includes graphical reports so that you can create graphical reports and add clipart without having to export data to another program. For example, the Burndown reports show planned work, completed work, and remaining work as lines on a graph. Project 2013 adds pre-installed ability to compare projects, do dashboards, and export to Visual Reports.

; Trace task paths: This feature allows you to highlight the link chain (or &#x27;task path&#x27;) for any task. When you click on a specific task, all of its predecessor tasks show up in one color and all of its successor tasks show up in another color.

; Sharing: Project 2013 improves the sharing and communication features of its predecessors in multiple ways without leaving Project. With Lync installed, hovering over a name allows you to start an IM session, a video chat, an email, or a phone call. You can copy and paste content to any of the Microsoft Office suites. You can sync content to SharePoint or a SkyDrive to share without going through Project and Project Online provides an online project management web app that has all of the functionality of Project 2013 and can be accessed from any web-enabled device.

===Project 2016===

Project 2016 adds a new Reports section, backwards-compatibility with Project Server 2013, better integration with other Microsoft products, and improved appearance of user interface items:

; Timeline: Allows user to customize views to have multiple timeline bars and custom date ranges in a single view.

; Resource Agreements: Gives features for resource planning coordination between Project Manager and Resource Manager.

; Office 2016 style theme and help: Uses the new Office query &#x27;tell me what you want to do&#x27;.

; Backwards compatibility with Microsoft Project Server 2013: The transition of enterprises from one version to the next may be eased by this product being able to interact with the earlier version of server.

<text>Tongues and Tails is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Sophie B. Hawkins, released in 1992 on Columbia records. It was produced by Rick Chertoff and Ralph Schuckett. 

The album contains ten original tracks, including &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot; and &quot;California Here I Come&quot;, and a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Want You&quot;; in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Paul Evans described the style of her version as &quot;breathy techno-MOR&quot;.

The album, which sold over 850,000 units worldwide, was a commercial and critical success. It was awarded &quot;Best Pop Album&quot; and &quot;Best Debut Album by a Solo Artist&quot; at the 1992 New York Music Awards, and earned Hawkins a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist in 1993.

==Background==
Hawkins recorded her debut album, &quot;Tongues and Tails&quot;, after signing a contract with Columbia Records, who had liked a demo tape she circulated to various labels. She was enthusiastic about her relationship with the label, telling &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1992, &quot;Once it sunk into my brain that I got this deal because [Columbia] believed in me and my music, I was able to dig into making this album without any inhibitions.&quot;

==Singles==
The lead single, &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot;, preceded the album and was released in the US on March 31, 1992. It achieved success in many countries worldwide; in the United States, it reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single, &quot;California Here I Come&quot;, was released in July 1992. It failed to appear on any &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, but did peak at number 79 on the US &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 Pop Singles chart. &quot;I Want You&quot; was issued as the third and final single in October 1992, but was not a chart success. It did, however, reach number 49 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1993.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; believed that &quot;Tongues and Tails&quot; &quot;distinguishes itself from the femme-fronted confessional genre by contrasting sensitive lyrics with insinuating pop grooves, &#x27;70s soul stylings, and African-tribal percussion&quot;. They added that Hawkins &quot;reveals a unique voice and charisma that&#x27;s well worth the attention.&quot; Kent Zimmerman of &quot;Gavin Report&quot; described the album as &quot;one of this year&#x27;s prime releases&quot;. He noted how Hawkins has &quot;carved a personality niche right alongside her textured and keyboard-drive recordings&quot;, which &quot;emphasizes sex and affection during dangerous times&quot;. &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; stated that &quot;Hawkins&#x27; music ranges from churchlike keyboards to what should be instant favorites on the dance floor—sort of an early Springsteen to current Madonna.&quot;

<text>Otto John Jelinek (Czech: Otakar Jelínek; born May 20, 1940) is a businessman, former figure skater, and Canadian politician. Jelinek&#x27;s family fled to Switzerland, then to Canada from Czechoslovakia in 1948, following the Communist coup d&#x27;état when communists nationalized his father&#x27;s cork and aluminium caps factory. Jelinek was appointed as ambassador of Canada to the Czech Republic in August 2013.

==Figure skating career==

* J = Junior level
Jelinek competed as a pair skater with his sister, Maria. They are the 1962 World Champions, the 1961 North American national champions, and 1961-1962 Canadian national champions. They represented Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics, where they placed 4th.

After they won the World Championships in 1962, the Jelineks retired from competition, and toured professionally with Ice Capades. In late 1963, Jelinek became engaged to Darlene Streich, an American ice dancer who went on to win the U.S. Championships in that discipline in 1964.

The Jelineks were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1962 and into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Political career==

After retiring from professional skating, Jelinek started a business, Canadian Skate Industries, to manufacture figure and hockey skates for the mass market. He also had considerable investments in real estate.

After a time in business, Otto Jelinek entered politics and was elected in the 1972 election to the House of Commons as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for High Park-Humber Valley in Metropolitan Toronto. He was re-elected in 1974. In 1979, he switched to the riding of Halton, where he ran and won in the 1979 federal election.

When the Tories formed government after the 1984 election, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Jelinek to Cabinet as Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport, and the Minister responsible for Multiculturalism.

In 1988, he was named Minister of Supply and Services, and later, Minister of National Revenue. Jelinek was returned to Parliament in the 1988 federal election in Oakville—Milton left politics after Mulroney retired and did not run in the 1993 election. In 2013, he was appointed as ambassador of Canada to the Czech Republic.

==Business career==
In 1994, he moved to the Czech Republic, and became chairman of the Board of Directors of Deloitte &amp; Touche Central Europe, and chairman and managing partner of the firm in the Czech Republic, a position he held until 2006. In 2007, Jelinek assumed the role of chairman of Colliers International, CEE Region. Jelinek was also a chairman of the society Olympiad for Czech Republic, which led the activities of Prague to become the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics.

In 2011, Jelinek became a Managing Partner with Passport Energy, a Canadian oil and gas company, with responsibility for corporate and financial affairs in Europe.

<doc id="1126162" wikidata="Q133878" url="?curid=1126162" title="Chlorophyll a">
<text>Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; is a specific form of chlorophyll used in oxygenic photosynthesis. It absorbs most energy from wavelengths of violet-blue and orange-red light, and it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum. Chlorophyll does not reflect light but chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green because green light is diffusively reflected by structures like cell walls. This photosynthetic pigment is essential for photosynthesis in eukaryotes, cyanobacteria and prochlorophytes because of its role as primary electron donor in the electron transport chain. Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; also transfers resonance energy in the antenna complex, ending in the reaction center where specific chlorophylls P680 and P700 are located.

==Distribution of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;==
Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; is essential for most photosynthetic organisms to release chemical energy but is not the only pigment that can be used for photosynthesis. All oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;, but differ in accessory pigments like chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;. Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; can also be found in very small quantities in the green sulfur bacteria, an anaerobic photoautotroph. These organisms use bacteriochlorophyll and some chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; but do not produce oxygen. Anoxygenic photosynthesis is the term applied to this process, unlike oxygenic photosynthesis where oxygen is produced during the light reactions of photosynthesis.

==Molecular structure==
The molecular structure of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; consists of a chlorin ring, whose four nitrogen atoms surround a central magnesium atom, and has several other attached side chains and a hydrocarbon tail formed by a phytol ester.
===Chlorin ring===

Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; contains a magnesium ion encased in a large ring structure known as a chlorin. The chlorin ring is a heterocyclic compound derived from pyrrole. Four nitrogen atoms from the chlorin surround and bind the magnesium atom. The magnesium center uniquely defines the structure as a chlorophyll molecule. The porphyrin ring of bacteriochlorophyll is saturated, and lacking alternation of double and single bonds causing variation in absorption of light.

===Side chains===

Side chains are attached to the chlorin ring of the various chlorophyll molecules. Different side chains characterize each type of chlorophyll molecule, and alters the absorption spectrum of light.
 For instance, the only difference between chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; is that chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; has an aldehyde instead of a methyl group at the C-7 position.

===Hydrocarbon tail===
The phytol ester of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; (R in the diagram) is a long hydrophobic tail which anchors the molecule to other hydrophobic proteins in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Once detached from the porphyrin ring, phytol becomes the precursor of two biomarkers, pristane and phytane, which are important in the study of geochemistry and the determination of petroleum sources.

==Biosynthesis==

The Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; biosynthetic pathway utilizes a variety of enzymes. In most plants, chlorophyll is derived from glutamate and is synthesised along a branched pathway that is shared with heme and siroheme.
The initial steps incorporate glutamic acid into 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA); two molecules of ALA are then reduced to porphobilinogen (PBG), and four molecules of PBG are coupled, forming protoporphyrin IX.

Chlorophyll synthase is the enzyme that completes the biosynthesis of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; by catalysing the reaction 
:chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; + phytyl diphosphate formula_1 chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; + diphosphate
This forms an ester of the carboxylic acid group in chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; with the 20-carbon diterpene alcohol phytol.

==Reactions of photosynthesis==

===Absorbance of light===

====Light spectrum====

Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; absorbs light within the violet, blue and red wavelengths. Accessory photosynthetic pigments broaden the spectrum of light absorbed, increasing the range of wavelengths that can be used in photosynthesis. The addition of chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; next to chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; extends the absorption spectrum. In low light conditions, plants produce a greater ratio of chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; to chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules, increasing photosynthetic yield.

====Light gathering====

Absorption of light by photosynthetic pigments converts photons into chemical energy. Light energy radiating onto the chloroplast strikes the pigments in the thylakoid membrane and excites their electrons. Since the chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules only capture certain wavelengths, organisms may use accessory pigments to capture a wider range of light energy shown as the yellow circles. It then transfers captured light from one pigment to the next as resonance energy, passing energy one pigment to the other until reaching the special chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules in the reaction center. These special chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules are located in both photosystem II and photosystem I. They are known as P680 for Photosystem II and P700 for Photosystem I. P680 and P700 are the primary electron donors to the electron transport chain. These two systems are different in their redox potentials for one-electron oxidation. The Em for P700 is approximately 500mV, while the Em for P680 is approximately 1,100-1,200 mV.

===Primary electron donation===
Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; is very important in the energy phase of photosynthesis. Two electrons need to be passed to an electron acceptor for the process of photosynthesis to proceed. Within the reaction centers of both photosystems there are a pair of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; molecules that pass electrons on to the transport chain through redox reactions.

== Ocean ==
The concentration of chlorophyll A is used as an index of phytoplankton biomass. In the ocean, phytoplankton all contain the chlorophyll pigment, which has a greenish color.

Phytoplankton are microscopic organisms that live in watery environments and changes in the amount of phytoplankton indicate the change in productivity of the ocean. Phytoplankton can be affected indirectly by climatic factors, such as changes in water temperatures and surface winds.

<doc id="1126167" wikidata="Q554264" url="?curid=1126167" title="Antonio Maceo">
<text>Lt. General José Antonio de la Caridad Maceo y Grajales (June 14, 1845December 7, 1896) was a Cuban general and second-in-command of the Cuban Army of Independence.

Fellow Cubans gave Maceo the nickname &quot;The Bronze Titan&quot; (), nickname that he earned after being wounded several times in battle. Spaniards referred to Maceo as the &quot;Greater Lion&quot; (&quot;el León Mayor&quot;). Maceo was one of the most noteworthy guerrilla leaders in 19th century Latin America, comparable to José Antonio Páez of Venezuela in military acumen.

==Early years==
Maceo was the son of a Venezuelan farmer and dealer in agricultural products, , and a mulatto Cuban woman of Dominican descent, Mariana Grajales y Cuello. His father when still a young man, fought for the Spanish against the forces for independence led by Simón Bolívar, José Antonio Páez and others. In 1823, he moved from Caracas, Venezuela, to Santiago de Cuba after some of his comrades were exiled from South America. Maceo was born June 14, 1845, in the town of San Luis, in the Oriente Province outside Santiago de Cuba, in a farm known to locals as Jobabo. Although his father taught him skills in the use of arms and management of their small properties, it was his mother, Mariana Grajales, who inculcated in him a sense of order. This maternal discipline would be important in the development of Maceo&#x27;s character and would be reflected later in his acts as a military leader.

At the age of sixteen, Maceo went to work for his father, delivering products and supplies by mule. He was a successful entrepreneur and farmer. As the oldest of the children, he inherited his father&#x27;s leadership qualities and later would become a decorated general. Maceo developed an active interest in the political issues of his time and was initiated in the mysteries of Freemasonry. The Cuban Freemasonry movement was influenced by the principles of the French Revolution - &quot;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity&quot; - as well as the Masons&#x27; main guidelines: God, Reason, Virtue.

==Ten Years&#x27; War (1868–1878)==
Approximately two weeks after the October 10, 1868, revolt led by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes against Spain known as &quot;The Cry of Yara&quot; (&quot;el Grito de Yara&quot;), Maceo, together with his father and brothers joined the war. Mariana Grajales, followed her family members into the &quot;manigua&quot; (the woods and most thick countryside) in order to support the Mambises, as Cuban rebels were known in the 19th century. The Maceos enlisted as privates when the Ten Years&#x27; War began. Within five months, Antonio Maceo was promoted to commander (or major), and within a matter of weeks after that he was again promoted to lieutenant colonel.

A promotion to colonel followed, and five years later he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general because of his bravery and ability to outmaneuver the Spanish Army. Maceo participated in more than 500 battles. However, the humble origin of Maceo and the colour of his skin delayed his raising to the rank of major general, due principally to the racist and class exclusiveness tendencies of several other patriots of an aristocratic or bourgeois origin. Men under Maceo&#x27;s command began to call him &quot;The Bronze Titan&quot;, because of his exceptional physical strength and resistance to bullet or blade injuries. He recovered from more than 25 war injuries over the course of some 500 military battles, and none of Maceo&#x27;s wounds diminished his willingness to lead his troops into combat.

He had special recognition and admiration, as chief and war teacher, of the great Dominican strategist Máximo Gómez, who would become, in the years to come, the General-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberator Army. The use of the machete as a war weapon by Gómez as a substitute for the Spanish sword (also due to the scarcity of firearms and ammunition) was rapidly adopted by Maceo and his troops.

Antonio Maceo rejected the military seditions of Lagunas de Varona and Santa Rita, which undermined the independence troops&#x27; unity and favoured a regionalism in Las Villas. This stood in contrast with the style of leadership exhibited by Vicente García González, who eschewed front line heroics in favor of planning from behind the lines, and who also advocated a regional approach to secession. Divisionism and the imprecise designs of García were plainly rejected by Maceo when the former asked for support to constitute a &quot;New Revolutionary Government&quot;.

Divisions, regionalism, and indiscipline were the main reasons for the decline of the Revolution, of which the Spanish General Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón, then already named Captain General of Cuba, drew considerable advantage. An officer of honour, he offered peace guarantees, amnesty for revolutionary men and legal reforms, in exchange for a cease of hostilities, which had already lasted 10 years (in 1878). At the same time, the Spanish Government continued the concentration of more forces to enclose the diminishing Cuban rebel forces.

Antonio Maceo was one of the officers who opposed the signing of the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years&#x27; War. He and other &quot;Mambises&quot; (independence soldiers) met with General Martínez-Campos on March 15, 1878, to discuss the peace terms, but Maceo argued that no peace could be achieved if none of the objectives of the war had been accomplished; chief among these aims was the abolition of slavery in Cuba and Cuban independence. The only immediate benefit was amnesty for those involved in the conflict and liberty for the black soldiers who had fought in the &quot;Liberator Army&quot;. Maceo did not recognize the treaty as valid and did not adhere to the proposed amnesty. This meeting, known as the Protest of Baraguá, began when a messenger was sent to Maceo from another Cuban high-ranking officer, who proposed an ambush against the Spanish general. Maceo rejected the plan, informing the would-be conspirator via letter: &quot;I don&#x27;t want victory if it goes accompanied with dishonor.&quot;

After respecting the truce time for the interview (a few days), Maceo resumed hostilities. In order to save his life, the government of the Republic of Cuba gave him the task of gathering money, arms and men for an expedition from the exterior. Maceo&#x27;s movements were useless however, due to the dismay of the exiled sympathizers who were unhappy with the Zanjón pact.

Later in 1879, Maceo and Major General Calixto García Íñiguez planned from New York a new invasion to Cuba, which initiated the short-lived Little War. Maceo did not personally fight in these battles, for he had sent Calixto García as highest commander. This avoided exacerbating the racist prejudices of fellow Cuban officers that were inflamed by Spanish propaganda. The Spanish tried to create the impression that Maceo was trying to start a racial war against white Cubans, though their propaganda efforts did little damage to Maceo&#x27;s reputation.

==The Fruitful Truce (1879–1895)==

After a short stay in Haiti, where he was pursued by the Spanish and faced assassination attempts by the Spanish consulates, and also in Jamaica, Maceo eventually settled in the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste. The president of Costa Rica assigned Maceo to a military unit and provided him with a small farm to live on. Maceo was contacted by José Martí and urged to initiate the War of 1895, called by Martí the &quot;necessary war&quot;.

Maceo, with the experience and wisdom gained from previous revolutionary failures, argued that there were a number of impediments to military success in a brief but intense epistolary exchange with Martí, warning about the causes of the partial defeat in the Ten Years&#x27; War (1868–78). Martí responded with his formula of &quot;the army, free; but the country, as a country with all its dignity represented,&quot; and convinced Maceo of the high probabilities of success if the war was to be prepared carefully. As a precondition, Maceo demanded that highest command should be in the hands of Gómez, which was approved without reservation by the Delegate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Martí). In Costa Rica, he faced, gun in hand, another attempt of assassination by Spanish agents at the exit of a theatre, with fatal result for one of the aggressors.

==Cuban War of Independence==
In 1895, together with Flor Crombet and other lesser officers, Maceo disembarked in the vicinity of Baracoa (close to the eastern tip of Cuba) and after repelling a Spanish attempt at capturing or killing him, he got into the mountains of that region. After many difficulties, he managed to gather a small contingent of armed men, which rapidly grew with other rebel groups of the Santiago de Cuba region. In the farm of &quot;La Mejorana&quot;, Maceo had a historic, but unfortunate, meeting with Gómez and Martí, because of the disagreements between him and Martí, regarding the question of the relationship between the military movements and the civilian government, against which constitution was Maceo, but Martí, knowing both sides of the problem, stood on his formula. Several days later, Martí, treated as a non-military &quot;Doctor&quot; by Maceo, would fall in battle in Dos Ríos (confluence between the rivers Contramaestre and Cauto).

After Gómez was designated General in Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army, Maceo was named Lieutenant General (second in command after the General in Chief). Starting from Mangos de Baraguá (place of the historical protest in front of Martínez-Campos), Maceo and Gómez, on command of two long mambises columns, took brilliantly the task of invading the west of Cuba, riding or walking more than 1000 miles in 96 days. After several months bleeding the Spanish forces in Havana and Pinar del Río Maceo arrived at Mantua, in the western extreme of Cuba, in October 1896, after defeating for many times the technically and numerically superior forces of the Spaniards (five times the Cuban forces on occasions).

Using alternately the tactics of guerrilla and open warfare, they exhausted the Spanish Army of more than a quarter million soldiers and traversed all the island, even through the military trails, walls and fences built by the Spanish Army with the purpose of stopping them and dealing with an overwhelming technical and numerical superiority of the Spaniards. The level of coordination and cohesiveness of Cuban forces was driven by the fact that Máximo Gómez had clearly established a chain of command that subordinated all Major Generals to Maceo, his executive officer.

The invasion of Western Cuba had been previously attempted by Brigadier General Henry Reeve during the Ten Years&#x27; War but faltered (and collapsed) between the easternmost section of the province of Matanzas and the westernmost section of the province of Havana and Reeve perished. At the time Maceo had collaborated with Reeve under the direction of Máximo Gómez.

The eagerness for independence and the cruelty of the Spanish high officers made rural inhabitants of the western half of the island eager to give support in men and logistics to the Liberation Army. This was the cause of the institution, by Valeriano Weyler, of the reconcentration. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were forcibly carried to the cities, mainly Havana, Pinar del Río and Matanzas, besides several minor cities in these three provinces. In the concentration camps created for them, very similar to those later built in Europe by the Nazis, almost a third part of the Cuban rural population lost their lives.

Contrary to the expectations of Weyler, the cruel reconcentration encouraged many people to join to the Liberation army, preferring to die in battle than in starvation. In 1896, after meeting Gómez in Havana (crossing once more the trail from Mariel to Majana via Mariel Bay), he returned to the fields of Pinar del Río, where he faced bloody clashes with outnumbering forces, led by Spanish generals famous for their victories in Africa and the Philippines, and provided with artillery and the most modern weapons for infantry including the Mauser bolt-action rifle. After decimating Spanish forces in the westernmost mountains of Cuba, Maceo turned eastward again, crossing the mentioned trail in order to travel to Las Villas or Camagüey. There he was planning to meet Gómez to plan the ulterior course of war, and with the Government in Arms, to establish an agreement between it and the forces in action, in relation with two main subjects: the raisings of medium and high officers in the Liberation Army and the recognition of belligerence by foreign countries and acceptation of direct military aid. His position was, at that time, acquiescent with accepting economic aid and packages with weapons and ammunitions from Europe or even from the United States, but was strongly opposed to acceptance by Cubans in the independence movement for a direct military intervention by the US in Cuba.

==Death==
His plans for meeting with Gómez and the Government in Arms never took place. On December 7, 1896, in the vicinity of Punta Brava, Maceo was advancing into the farm of San Pedro, accompanied only by his personal escort (two or three men), the physician of his Headquarters (who sold their position to the Spanish Colonel Francisco Cirugeda), Brigade General José Miró Argenter, and a small troop of no more than twenty men. When they attempted to cut a fence for facilitating the march of horses through those lands, they were detected by a strong Spanish column, which opened an intense fire. Maceo was hit by two shots, one in the chest and another that broke his jaw and penetrated his skull. His companions could not carry him because of the intensity of the firefight and Maceo&#x27;s size. The only rebel who stayed by him was his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Francisco Gómez Toro (known as Panchito), son of Máximo Gómez, who faced the Spanish column for the sole purpose of protecting the body of his general. After being shot several times, the Spaniards killed Gómez with machete strikes, leaving both bodies abandoned, not knowing the identity of the fallen.

The corpses of Maceo and Panchito were picked up the next day by Colonel Aranguren, from Havana, who ran immediately to the battle scene after hearing the news. They were later buried in secret in the farm of two brothers who swore to keep the burial place in secrecy until Cuba would be free and independent and the correspondent military honors could be given to the hero. Nowadays, the remains of Antonio Maceo y Grajales and Francisco Gómez Toro lie in the Monumento El Cacahual south of Havana, close to the limits of the former farm of San Pedro, and the site is one of pilgrimage by Cuban people. Scholars say that Maceo&#x27;s death was as traumatic to Cuban patriots as Martí&#x27;s.

==Legacy==


In addition to his role as a soldier and statesman in the Cuban movement for independence, Maceo was an influential political strategist and military planner, and José Martí is among Cuban leaders who were inspired by Maceo. Being a member of masonry, in his correspondence one can read more than once his credo base on &quot;God, Reason and Virtue&quot;. He was quoted as having a strict motto: &quot;My duties to country and to my own political convictions are above all human effort; with these I shall reach the pedestal of freedom or I shall perish fighting for my country&#x27;s redemption.&quot; (November 3, 1890). Martí, speaking about him, said that &quot;Maceo has as much strength in his head as in his arms.&quot;

Of democratic political adherence, he expressed many times his sympathy for the republican form of government, but insisted on seeking for the formula of &quot;liberty; equality and fraternity&quot;, recalling the well-known but almost never applied principles of the French Revolution and defining a policy on the search for social justice. Being in a dinner meeting in a very short visit made to Santiago de Cuba during the Fruitful Truce, he was invited to make a toast and a phrase was said by a young man for a wish to annex Cuba to the United States and turn Cuba into &quot;...another star into the constellation of the United States...&quot;. His answer was: I think, young man, that this would be the only occasion in which I would place my sword at the same side with the Spanish ones.&quot; And foreseeing the growth of North American expansionism, (he was absolutely convinced of the inevitable victory of Cuban Arms), he expressed in a letter to a friend of arms: &quot;That (country) which attempts to seize Cuba, will gather the dust of its ground soaked in blood, if he does not perish in fight.&quot;

===Monuments===

Monuments to Maceo include those in Santiago de Cuba and another in Havana, between the Malecón and the front of the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital in Centro Habana.

The towns of Maceo, Kentucky and Maceo, Antioquia are also named in his honor.

A bust of Macao can be found in Ellsworth Park in Union City, New Jersey, which has been called Havana on the Hudson.

<doc id="1126184" wikidata="Q2716514" url="?curid=1126184" title="Aiden Ford">
<text>First Lieutenant Aiden Ford, USMC is a fictional character in the 2004 Canadian-American Sci-Fi Channel television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, a military science fiction show about a combined civilian and military team exploring another galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices. Played by Rainbow Sun Francks, Aiden Ford is introduced as a main character in the season one premiere &quot;Rising&quot;, holding the military rank of first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps.

Ford is a regular in season one. He appears in a recurring role season two and appears once in a dream sequence in the season five premiere episode Search and Rescue. He later reappears in the official continuation novel &quot;Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path&quot; in which his ultimate fate is revealed.

==Television==
Lieutenant Aiden Ford is introduced in the series premiere, &quot;Rising&quot;, where he is stationed at the Antarctica outpost. Ford served in the Stargate Command (SGC) before and is twenty-five years old at the beginning of the first season. Ford served as John Sheppard&#x27;s second-in-command after the events of &quot;Rising&quot; until a Wraith feeds upon Ford during a Wraith attack on Atlantis in season 2&#x27;s &quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;. An exploding grenade blows them off a building into the ocean, and Ford&#x27;s unconscious body and the still attached Wraith are recovered over an hour later. Ford survives after having an overdose of Wraith enzyme and later undergoes mental and physical changes. Ford develops a solid black left eye and becomes more aggressive and paranoid, fleeing Atlantis with a stolen Puddle Jumper.

The Atlantis team encounters him again in &quot;Runner&quot; where they learn that Ford began killing Wraiths throughout the Pegasus galaxy to harvest their enzyme that gave him abnormal strength. Ford is presumed dead when he deliberately jumps into the culling beam of a Wraith dart, but the Atlantis team encounters him again in the mid-season 2-parter &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;/&quot;The Hive&quot;. The Wraith-enzyme allowed Ford to awake immediately after rematerializing on board a Wraith-hive ship, from where he escaped only to build up a small strike force of young men following his suit by informing them about the benefits of the Wraith-enzyme. Ford asks the Atlantis team for help in destroying an entire Wraith Hive-ship, but the mission fails and forces Sheppard to leave Ford behind on an about-to-explode hive ship. Ford is only seen again in Sheppard&#x27;s dream in the season 5 episode &quot;Search and Rescue&quot;.

==Literature==
Ford reappears in the official novel continuation &quot;Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path&quot;. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and with a group of nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents.

==Conceptual history==

After the end of season 1, the series producers, and the actor himself, felt that Ford had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write him out, the writers came up with an idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to a recurring character. Producer Joseph Mallozzi said in 2009 that &quot;We can assume [Ford] went down [...] with the ship&quot; in &quot;The Hive&quot;. Rainbow Sun Francks was disappointed about the evolution of his character, saying Ford did not evolve a backstory which the other characters did. Although Francks called the situation &quot;tough&quot;, he reacted positively towards the development of character during the second season.

After announcing that Ronon Dex would become a main character in the &quot;Atlantis&quot; series, they followed up with another announcement saying that they had reduced Ford to a recurring character in the series. Many fans were disappointed with this new development because many felt he didn&#x27;t have time to &quot;prove&quot; himself in the new series and that the character was never fully developed compared to the other characters in the show. Many campaigns to save the character were created after the announcement, the most notable being the F.O.R.D. campaign. Francks said that the change was not a &quot;blow&quot;, since he and Brad Wright had already discussed the change. He was also more positive in the change of story arc for the character, saying he was a &quot;big part&quot; of the second season compared to season one where they hadn&#x27;t had enough episodes to broaden the character. When asked about reducing Francks&#x27; role in &quot;Atlantis&quot;, Wright replied &quot;The change in status means that Francks will not appear in every episode, and will not be listed in the show&#x27;s opening credits.&quot;

==Reception==
Fans of the character set up campaigns to get Ford back as a main character later in season two or season three. They sent various petitions to the producers, cast and crew of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; to change their minds. Fans of the character even put up a website under the name F.O.R.D., which in turn was also the name for one of the campaigns fighting for the revival of the character.

<doc id="1126185" wikidata="Q2056788" url="?curid=1126185" title="Paterson Inlet">
<text>Paterson Inlet (officially Paterson Inlet / Whaka a Te Wera) is a large natural harbour—specifically a ria—in the eastern coast of Stewart Island, New Zealand. Much of the land surrounding Paterson Inlet is unspoilt forest, and runoff into the harbour is especially clean. 

== History ==
This region was first inhabited by the Māori, who settled at a locale known as &quot;The Neck&quot;, which is a long peninsula that extends across the mouth of the inlet from the southern coast. The only town on Stewart Island, Oban is located on the north coast of the inlet, close to its mouth. In earlier times, the inlet was used as a base for whaling. Southern right whales were the main target in this area and over exploited. However, their sightings around the island are increasing recently.

== Geography ==
Paterson Inlet has three main arms; North Arm and South West Arm lie at the upper reaches of the inlet, 15 kilometres from its mouth. Big Glory Bay, the third arm of the inlet, lies behind The Neck in the southeast of the inlet. The inlet drains the Rakeahua and Freshwater Rivers, the latter of which drains a large swampy valley that covers much of the northern part of the island.

Several islands lie in the inlet, notably Ulva Island and Native Island.

== Fishing ==
In 2004, the majority of Paterson Inlet was made a mātaitai reserve, a type of marine reserve which prohibits commercial fishing while allowing customary rights to fish, as well as recreational fishing. The reserve, designated Te Whaka a Te Wera Mātaitai Reserve, does not cover the Ulva Island–Te Wharawhara Marine Reserve which was also created in 2004, but was designated a marine reserve to prohibit all fishing.

<doc id="1126187" wikidata="Q135231" url="?curid=1126187" title="Pliopithecus">
<text>Pliopithecus (meaning &quot;more ape&quot;) is a genus of extinct primates of the Miocene. It was discovered in 1837 by Édouard Lartet (1801–1871) in France, with fossils subsequently discovered in Switzerland, Slovakia and Spain.

&quot;Pliopithecus&quot; had a similar size and form to modern gibbons, to which it may be related, although it is probably not a direct ancestor. It had long limbs, hands, and feet, and may have been able to brachiate, swinging between trees using its arms. Unlike gibbons, it had a short tail, and only partial stereoscopic vision.

They appear to have originated in Asia and extended their range into Europe between 20 and 17 million years ago. 

Begun and Harrison list the following species within the genus:
* &quot;Pliopithecus antiquus&quot;
* &quot;Pliopithecus bii&quot;
* &quot;Pliopithecus canmatensis&quot;
* &quot;Pliopithecus platyodon&quot;
* &quot;Pliopithecus vindobonensis&quot;
* &quot;Pliopithecus zhanxiangi&quot;

&quot;Pliopithecus antiquus&quot; has been referred to previously as &quot;P. piveteaui&quot;. &quot;P. vindobonensis&quot; is sometimes considered to be a separate genus, &quot;Epipliopithecus&quot;. &quot;Anapithecus&quot; is a close relative and was initially considered a subgenus of &quot;Pliopithecus&quot;.

<doc id="1126189" wikidata="Q255266" url="?curid=1126189" title="Anticipation">
<text>Anticipation is an emotion involving pleasure or anxiety in considering or awaiting an expected event. Anticipatory emotions include fear, anxiety, hope and trust. When the anticipated event fails to occur, it results in disappointment (for a positive event) or relief (for a negative one).

==As a defence mechanism==
Robin Skynner considered anticipation as one of &quot;the mature ways of dealing with real stress... You reduce the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how you are going to deal with it&quot;. There is evidence that &quot;the use of mature defenses (sublimation, anticipation) tended to increase with age&quot;, yet anticipation of negative events itself tends to decrease with age.

==Desire==

Anticipation has been described as &quot;the central ingredient in sexual desire.&quot; As &quot;sex has a major cognitive component — the most important element for desire is positive anticipation&quot;. One name for pleasurable anticipation is .

More broadly, anticipation is a central motivating force in everyday life — &quot;the normal process of imaginative anticipation of, or speculation about, the future&quot;. To enjoy one&#x27;s life, &quot;one needs a belief in Time as a promising medium to do things in; one needs to be able to suffer the pains and pleasures of anticipation and deferral&quot;.

==In music==
There are several theories explaining anticipation in music. Two prominent theories are the neurological theories of Chase that attribute expectation building and anticipation both to inherent neurological pitch evolution (Darwinian selection as pitch/rhythm/harmony communication response expectation) and the related skillful use of chord sequences (holding V7 until expectations are met with E, A, B7, or the well-known Am/D7/G tease-satisfy sequence, with variations in the wheel of fifths).

A second well-accepted theory is Huron&#x27;s &quot;ITPRA&quot; 5 module theory of expectation, where previous imaginative tension hits the event onset/horizon, with prediction and reaction oscillating (alternating) in the response system, and resulting in appraisal feedback.

From a global perspective, even given thousands of varying scale types worldwide, there is a universal human sense of satisfaction in the return to that scale&#x27;s tonic (for example, C, in the major scale, key, and tonic of C major).

In the context of the broader topic of Music and emotion, Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&#x27;s BRECVEM model includes, as its seventh element, Musical expectation.

Technically, anticipation also refers specifically to a type of nonchord tone.

==In phenomenology==
For phenomenological philosopher Edmund Husserl, anticipation is an essential feature of human action. &quot;In every action we know the goal in advance in the form of an anticipation that is &#x27;empty&#x27;, in the sense of vague...and [we] seek by our action to bring it step by step to concrete realization&quot;.

<text>In genetics, anticipation is a phenomenon whereby as a genetic disorder is passed on to the next generation, the symptoms of the genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age with each generation. In most cases, an increase in the severity of symptoms is also noted. Anticipation is common in trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Huntington&#x27;s disease and myotonic dystrophy, where a dynamic mutation in DNA occurs. All of these diseases have neurological symptoms. Prior to the understanding of the genetic mechanism for anticipation, it was debated whether anticipation was a true biological phenomenon or whether the earlier age of diagnosis was related to heightened awareness of disease symptoms within a family.

==Trinucleotide repeats and expansion==

Trinucleotide repeats are apparent in a number of loci in the human genome. They have been found in introns, exons and 5&#x27; or 3&#x27; UTR&#x27;s. They consist of a pattern of three nucleotides (e.g. CGG) which is repeated a number of times. During meiosis, unstable repeats can undergo triplet expansion (see later section); in this case, the germ cells produced have a greater number of repeats than are found in the somatic tissues.

The mechanism behind the expansion of the triplet repeats is not well understood. One hypothesis is that the increasing number of repeats influences the overall shape of the DNA, which can have an effect on its interaction with DNA polymerase and thus the expression of the gene.

== Disease mechanisms ==

For many of the loci, trinucleotide expansion is harmless, but in some areas expansion has detrimental effects that cause symptoms. When the trinucleotide repeat is present within the protein-coding region, the repeat expansion leads to production of a mutant protein with gain of function. This is the case for Huntington&#x27;s disease, where the trinucleotide repeat encodes a long stretch of glutamine residues. When the repeat is present in an untranslated region, it could affect the expression of the gene in which the repeat is found (ex. fragile X) or many genes through a dominant negative effect (ex. myotonic dystrophy).

In order to have a deleterious effect, the number of repeats must cross a certain threshold. For example, normal individuals have between 5 and 30 CTG repeats within the 3&#x27; UTR of &quot;DMPK&quot;, the gene that is altered in myotonic dystrophy. If the number of repeats is between 50 and 100, the person is only mildly affected – perhaps having only cataracts. However, meiotic instability could result in a dynamic mutation that increases the number of repeats in offspring inheriting the mutant allele. Once the number of copies reaches over 100, the disease will manifest earlier in life (although the individual will still reach adulthood before the symptoms are evident) and the symptoms will be more severe – including electrical myotonia. As the number progresses upwards past 400, the symptoms show themselves during childhood or infancy.

==Examples of diseases showing anticipation==

Diseases showing anticipation include:
* Autosomal dominant
** Several spinocerebellar ataxias
** Huntington&#x27;s disease – CAG
** Myotonic dystrophy – CTG
** Dyskeratosis congenita – TTAGGG (telomere repeat sequence)
* Autosomal recessive
** Friedreich ataxia – GAA (Note: Friedreich ataxia does not usually exhibit anticipation because it is an autosomal recessive disorder.)
* X-linked
** Fragile X syndrome – CGG
* Without expression type
** Crohn&#x27;s disease
** Behçet&#x27;s disease

<doc id="1126212" wikidata="Q198921" url="?curid=1126212" title="Ziehl–Neelsen stain">
<text>The Ziehl-Neelsen stain, also known as the acid-fast stain, is a bacteriological staining technique used in cytopathology and microbiology to identify acid-fast bacteria under microscopy, particularly members of the &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; genus. This staining method was initially introduced by Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) and subsequently modified by the German bacteriologists Franz Ziehl (1859–1926) and Friedrich Neelsen (1854–1898) during the late 19th century.

The acid-fast staining method, in conjunction with auramine phenol staining, serves as the standard diagnostic tool and is widely accessible for rapidly diagnosing tuberculosis (caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;) and other diseases caused by atypical mycobacteria, such as leprosy (caused by &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;) and &quot;Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare&quot; infection (caused by &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex) in samples like sputum, gastric washing fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These acid-fast bacteria possess a waxy lipid-rich outer layer that contains high concentrations of mycolic acid, rendering them resistant to conventional staining techniques like the Gram stain.

After the Ziehl-Neelsen staining procedure using carbol fuchsin, acid-fast bacteria are observable as vivid red or pink rods set against a blue or green background, depending on the specific counterstain used, such as methylene blue or malachite green, respectively. Non-acid-fast bacteria and other cellular structures will be colored by the counterstain, allowing for clear differentiation.

==Mycobacteria==
In anatomic pathology specimens, immunohistochemistry and modifications of Ziehl–Neelsen staining (such as Fite-Faraco staining) have comparable diagnostic utility in identifying &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. Both of them are superior to traditional Ziehl–Neelsen stain.

&quot;Mycobacterium&quot; are slow-growing rod-shaped bacilli that are slightly curved or straight, and are considered to be Gram positive. Some mycobacteria are free-living saprophytes, but many are pathogens that cause disease in animals and humans. &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; causes tuberculosis in cattle. Since tuberculosis can be spread to humans, milk is pasteurized to kill any of the bacteria. &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; that causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans is an airborne bacterium that typically infects the human lungs. Testing for TB includes blood testing, skin tests, and chest X-rays. When looking at the smears for TB, it is stained using an acid-fast stain. These acid-fast organisms like &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods such as a Gram stain. It can also be used to stain a few other bacteria, such as &quot;Nocardia&quot;. The reagents used for Ziehl–Neelsen staining are carbol fuchsin, acid alcohol, and methylene blue. Acid-fast bacilli are bright red after staining.

==Fungi==
Ziehl–Neelsen staining is a type of narrow spectrum fungal stain. Narrow spectrum fungal stains are selective, and they can help differentiate and identify fungi. The results of Ziehl–Neelsen staining is variable because many fungal cell walls are not acid fast. An example of a common type of acid-fast fungus that is usually stained with Ziehl–Neelsen staining is called &quot;Histoplasma&quot; (HP). &quot;Histoplasma&quot; is found in soil and the feces of birds and bats. Humans can contract histoplasmosis by inhalation of the fungal spores. &quot;Histoplasma&quot; enters the body and goes to the lungs where the spores turn into yeast. The yeast gets into the blood stream and affects lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Usually people do not get sick from inhaling the spores, but if they do they usually have flu like symptoms. Another variation on this staining method is used in mycology to differentially stain acid-fast incrustations in the cuticular hyphae of certain species of fungi in the genus &quot;Russula&quot;. Some free endospores can be confused with small yeasts, so staining is used to identify the unknown fungi. It is also useful in the identification of some protozoa, namely &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; and &quot;Isospora&quot;. The Ziehl–Neelsen stain can also hinder diagnosis in the case of paragonimiasis because the eggs in sputum sample for ovum and parasite (O&amp;P) can be dissolved by the stain

==History==
In 1882 Robert Koch discovered the etiology of tuberculosis. Soon after Koch&#x27;s discovery, Paul Ehrlich developed a stain for mycobacterium tuberculosis, called the alum hematoxylin stain. Franz Ziehl then altered Ehrlich&#x27;s staining technique by using carbolic acid as the mordant. Friedrich Neelsen kept Ziehl&#x27;s choice of mordant but changed the primary stain to carbol fuchsin. Ziehl and Neelsen&#x27;s modifications together have developed the Ziehl–Neelsen stain. Another acid-fast stain was developed by Joseph Kinyoun by using the Ziehl–Neelsen staining technique but removing the heating step from the procedure. This new stain from Kinyoun was named the Kinyoun stain.

==Procedure==

A typical AFB stain procedure involves dropping the cells in suspension onto a slide, then air drying the liquid and heat fixing the cells.

Studies have shown that an AFB stain without a culture has a poor negative predictive value. An AFB culture should be performed along with an AFB stain; this has a much higher negative predictive value.

== Mechanism explanation ==
The mechanism of action of the Ziehl-Neelsen stain is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a chemical reaction between the acidic dyes and the cell walls of the bacteria. The acidity of the dyes causes them to bind more strongly to the cell walls of the bacteria than to other cells or tissues. This results in the selective staining of only those cells that have a high density of cell wall material, such as acid-fast bacteria.

The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is a two step staining process. In the first step, the tissue is stained with a basic fuchsin solution, which stains all cells pink. In the second step, the tissue is incubated in an acid alcohol solution, which decolorizes all cells except for acid-fast cells, which retain the color and appeared as red. The mechanisms by which this color is produced are not well understood, but it is thought that the interaction of the basic fuchsin with the cell wall components of bacteria creates a new molecule that is responsible for the color.

<text>In artificial intelligence (AI), anticipation occurs when an agent makes decisions based on its explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, &quot;anticipation&quot; can also refer to the ability to act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, without necessarily explicitly possessing a model of the future events.

The concept stays in contrast to the reactive paradigm, which is not able to predict future system states.

==In AI==
An agent employing anticipation would try to predict the future state of the environment (weather in this case) and make use of the predictions in the decision making. For example,

 If the sky is cloudy and the air pressure is low,
 it will probably rain soon
 so take the umbrella with you.
 Otherwise
 leave the umbrella home.

These rules explicitly take into account possible future events.

In 1985, Robert Rosen defined an anticipatory system as follows:

:A system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment,
:which allows it to change state at an instant in accord
:with the model&#x27;s predictions pertaining to a later instant.

To some extent, Rosen&#x27;s definition of anticipation applies to any system incorporating machine learning. At issue is how much of a system&#x27;s behaviour should or indeed can be determined by reasoning over dedicated representations, how much by on-line planning, and how much must be provided by the system&#x27;s designers.

==In animals==
Humans can make decisions based on explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, animals can act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, although they may not necessarily have an explicit cognitive model of the future; evolution may have shaped simpler systemic features that result in adaptive anticipatory behavior in a narrow domain. For example, hibernation is anticipatory behavior, but does not appear to be driven by a cognitive model of the future.

<text>Tirunelveli (), also known as Nellai and historically (during British rule) as Tinnevelly, is a major city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the administrative headquarters of the Tirunelveli District. It is the fourth-largest municipal corporation in the state after Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai. Tirunelveli is located southwest of the state capital Chennai, away from Thoothukudi, and from Kanyakumari. The downtown is located on the west bank of the Thamirabarani River; its twin Palayamkottai is on the east bank. Tirunelveli and its neighbourhood, Palayamkottai, have been called the Oxford of South India for their colleges. It has several important government offices.

Tirunelveli is an ancient city, recorded to be more than two millennia old. It has been ruled at different times by the Early Pandyas, the Cheras, the Medieval Cholas and Later Cholas, the later Pandyas, the Vijayanagara Empire and the British. The Polygar War, involving Palaiyakkarars led by Veerapandiya Kattabomman and forces of the British East India Company, was waged on the city&#x27;s outskirts from 1797 to 1801.

Tirunelveli is administered by the Municipal Corporation, established on 1 June 1994 by the Municipal Corporation Act. The city covers an area of , and holds a population of 473,637 in 2011. The total population after the inclusion of other municipalities is 968,984. Tirunelveli is well-connected by road and rail with the rest of Tamil Nadu and India. The nearest domestic airport is Thoothukudi Airport. The nearest international airports are Madurai International Airport and Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The nearest seaport is Thoothukudi Port.

Industries in Tirunelveli include administrative services, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agricultural machinery, information technology and educational services. The city is an educational hub of southern India, with institutions such as Tirunelveli Medical College, Govt. Siddha Medical College, Veterinary College and Research Institute Tirunelveli, Tirunelveli Law College, Government College of Engineering, Anna University Regional Campus – Tirunelveli, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University and much more.

Tirunelveli has a number of historical monuments, with the Nellaiappar Temple being the most prominent. The city is also renowned throughout the state for a sweet called &#x27;Irutu kadai halwa&#x27;.

==Etymology==
Tirunelveli is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Venu vanam (Bamboo Forest) and hence called Venuvanam. Tirunelveli was known in Sambandar&#x27;s seventh-century Saiva canonical work &quot;Tevaram&quot; as Thirunelveli. Swami Nellaiappar temple inscriptions say that Shiva (as Vrihivriteswara) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee. In Hindu legend, the place was known as Venuvana (&quot;forest of bamboo&quot;) due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared. The early Pandyas named the city Thenpandya Nadu or Thenpandya Seemai, the Cholas Mudikonda Cholamandalam and the Nayaks Tirunelveli Seemai; it was known as Tinnelvelly by the British, and Tirunelveli after independence. The word &quot;Tirunelveli&quot; is derived from three Tamil words: &quot;thiru&quot;, &quot;nel&quot; and &quot;veli&quot;, meaning &quot;sacred paddy hedge&quot;.

==History==

Tirunelveli was under the rule of Pandya kings as their secondary capital; Madurai was the empire&#x27;s primary capital. The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the Christian era from inscriptions by Ashoka (304–232 BCE) and mention in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the &quot;Brihat-Samhita&quot; and the writings of Megasthenes (350–290 CE). The province came under the rule of Cholas under Rajendra Chola I in 1064 CE; however, it is unclear whether he conquered the region or obtained it voluntarily. Tirunelveli remained under the control of the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital.

The Nellaiappar temple was the royal shrine of the later Pandyas during the 13th and 14th centuries, and the city benefited from dams constructed with royal patronage during the period. After the death of Kulasekara Pandian (1268–1308), the region was occupied by Vijayangara rulers and Marava chieftains (palayakarars, or &quot;poligars&quot;) during the 16th century. The Maravars occupied the western foothills and the Telugus, and the Kannadigas settled in the black-soil-rich eastern portion. Tirunelveli was the subsidiary capital of the Madurai Nayaks; under Viswanatha Nayak (1529–64), the city was rebuilt about 1560. Inscriptions from the Nellaiappar temple indicate the generous contributions to the temple. Nayak rule ended in 1736.

The region was captured by the subjects of the Mughal Empire such as Chanda Sahib (1740–1754) who declared himself &quot;Nawab of Tinnevelly&quot; as well as the Nawab of the Carnatic.
In 1743 Nizam-ul-mulk, lieutenant of the Deccan Plateau, displaced most of the Marathas from the region and Tirunelveli came under the rule of the Nawabs of Arcot. The original power lay in the hands of the &quot;polygars&quot;, who were originally military chiefs of the Nayaks. The city was known as Nellai Cheemai, with &quot;Cheemai&quot; meaning &quot;a developed foreign town&quot;. The &quot;polygars&quot; built forts in the hills, had 30,000 troops and waged war among themselves. In 1755, the British government sent a mission under Major Heron and Mahfuz Khan which restored some order and bestowed the city to Mahfuz Khan. The &quot;poligars&quot; waged war against Mahfuz Khan seven miles from Tirunelveli, but were defeated. The failure of Mahfuz Khan led the East India Company to send Muhammed Yusuf for help. Khan became ruler, rebelled in 1763 and was hanged in 1764. In 1758, British troops under Colonel Fullarton reduced the &quot;polygar&quot; stronghold under Veerapandiya Kattabomman. In 1797, the first Polygar war broke out between the British (under Major Bannerman) and the &quot;polygars&quot; (headed by Kattabomman). Some &quot;polygars&quot; (such as the head of Ettaiyapuram) aided the British; Kattabomman was defeated and hanged in his home province of Panchalaguruchi. Two years later, another rebellion became known as the Second Polygar War. Panchalaguruchi fell to the British, after stiff resistance. The Carnatic region came under British rule thereafter.

Tirunelveli District was formed on 1 September 1790 (Tirunelveli Day) by the East India Company (British) and named it as Tinnevelly district. The history of Tirunelveli was researched by Robert Caldwell (1814–91), a Christian missionary who visited the area. After acquiring Tirunelveli from the Nawab of Arcot in 1801, the British anglicised its name to &quot;Tinnevelly&quot; and made it the headquarters of Tinnelvelli District. The administrative and military headquarters was located in Palayamkottai (anglicised as &quot;Palankottah&quot;), from which attacks against the &quot;polygars&quot; were launched. After independence both cities reverted to their original names, and Tirunelveli remained the capital of Tirunelveli district. In early 1900s, parts of Tirunelveli district was made as Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts. In 1986, Tirunelveli district was further split into two districts for administrative purpose such as Chidambaranar (present-day Thoothukudi district) and Nellai-Kattabomman (later Tirunelveli-Kattabomman, present-day Tirunelveli districts). In 2019, Tenkasi was split from Tirunelveli District forming Tenkasi District.

==Geography==
Tirunelveli is located at , and its average elevation is . It is located at the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau. The Tamirabarani River divides the city into the Tirunelveli quarter and the Palayamkottai area. The river (with its tributaries, such as the Chittar) is the major source of irrigation, and is fed by the northeast and southwest monsoons. There are several small lakes of ponds (known as Kulam) in the city. These include Nainar Kulam, Veinthan Kulam, Elantha Kulam and Udayarpetti Kulam. The area around the Tamirabarani River and the Chittar has five streams: Kodagan, Palayan, Tirunelveli, Marudur East and Marudur West, and the Chittar feeds fifteen other channels. The soil is friable, red and sandy.

===Climate===
Tirunelveli has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) bordering on the relatively rare dry-summer tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;As&quot;), scattered irregularly across the world but relatively common in areas near the Laccadive Sea.

The climate of Tirunelveli is generally hot and humid. The average temperature during summer (March to June) ranges from to , and to during the rest of the year. The average annual rainfall is . Maximum precipitation occurs during the northeast monsoon (October–December). Since the economy of the district is primarily based on agriculture, flooding of the Tamarabarani River or a fluctuation in monsoon rain has an immediate impact on the local economy. The primary crops grown in the region are paddy and cotton. Pineapples were introduced during the 16th century, chilly and tobacco during the late 16th and potatoes during the early 17th centuries. The most common tree is the palmyra palm, a raw material in cottage industries. Other trees grown in the region are teak, wild jack, &quot;manjakadambu&quot;, &quot;venteak&quot;, &quot;vengai&quot;, &quot;pillaimaruthu&quot;, &quot;karimaruthu&quot; and bamboo. Livestock of the city and district comprises cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep and other animals in smaller numbers.

==Demographics==
According to 2011 census, Tirunelveli had a population of 473,637 with a sex-ratio of 1,027 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 46,624 were under the age of six, constituting 23,894 males and 22,730 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 13.17% and 0.32% of the population respectively. The average literacy of the city was 81.49%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The city had a total of 120,466 households. There were a total of 182,471 workers, comprising 2,088 cultivators, 5,515 main agricultural labourers, 18,914 in house hold industries, 142,435 other workers, 13,519 marginal workers, 166 marginal cultivators, 913 marginal agricultural labourers, 1,828 marginal workers in household industries and 10,612 other marginal workers.
Among Hindus Tirunelveli Saiva Pillai, Maravars, and Konars, are more predominant in population and also Large number of population from Nadars, Devendra Kula Vellalar, in Tirunelveli District.
According to provisional data from the 2011 census the Tirunelveli urban agglomeration had a population of 498,984, with 246,710 males and 252,274 females. The overall sex ratio in the city was 1023, and the child sex ratio was 957. Tirunelveli had a literacy rate of 91 percent, with male literacy 95 percent and female literacy 87 percent. A total of 42,756 of the city&#x27;s population was under age six.

As per the religious census of 2011, Tirunelveli had 69.0% Hindus, 20.02% Muslims, 10.59% Christians, 0.01% Sikhs, 0.01% Buddhists, 0.02% Jains and 0.35% following other religions.

The city covers an area of . The population density of the city in the 2001 census was 3,781 persons per square kilometre, compared with 2,218 persons per square kilometre in 1971. Hindus form the majority of the urban population, followed by Muslims and Christians. Tamil is the main language spoken in the city, but the use of English is relatively common; English is the medium of instruction in most educational institutions and offices in the service sector. The Tamil dialect spoken in this region is distinct, and is widely spoken throughout Tamil Nadu.

==Economy==
Inscriptions from the eighth to the 14th centuries (during the rule of the Pandyas, Cholas and later Tenkasi Pandyas) indicate the growth of Tirunelveli as a centre of economic growth which developed around the Nellaiappar temple. The drier parts of the province also flourished during the rule of the Vijayanagara kings. From 1550 until the early modern era, migration to the city from other parts of the state was common and the urban regions became hubs of manufacturing and commerce. Tirunelveli was a strategic point, connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula, as well as a trading centre. Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala. During the 1840s, cotton produced in the region was in demand for British mills. The chief exports during British rule were cotton, jaggery, chillies, tobacco, palmyra fibre, salt, dried saltwater fish and cattle.

In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second in the number of women workers. Service sectors such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for cotton textiles, spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city.

Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located on the outskirts of the city. The major agricultural produces in the region are paddy and cotton. Beedi production during the 1990s earned an annual revenue of 190 billion and a foreign exchange of 8 billion across the three districts of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirapalli and Vellore.

Tirunelveli is a major area for wind-power generation. Most wind-power-generation units in Tamil Nadu are located in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari Districts.

<doc id="1126223" wikidata="Q5763722" url="?curid=1126223" title="Rhinoscleroma">
<text>Rhinoscleroma, is a chronic granulomatous bacterial disease of the nose that can sometimes infect the upper respiratory tract. It most commonly affects the nasal cavity—the nose is involved in 95–100 per cent of cases—however, it can also affect the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Slightly more females than males are affected and patients are usually 10 to 30 years of age. Rhinoscleroma is considered a tropical disease and is mostly endemic to North Africa, South Asia and Central America, less common in the United States.

==Signs and symptoms==
Rhinoscleroma has been divided into 3 stages: 

# Atrophic stage: It is characterised by features similar to Atrophic Rhinitis such as foul smelling purulent nasal discharge and crusting of the nose.
# Granulomatous stage: It is characterised by formation of granulomatous nodules in the nose and characteristic &#x27;woody&#x27; appearance of the nose along with subdermal infiltration of the disease. The nodules formed are painless and non-ulcerative.
# Cicatricial stage: This is the final stage of the disease with prominent sclerosis and fibrosis. There is stenosis of the nares with adhesions in the nose, nasopharynx and oropharynx. There may also be respiratory distress due to subglottal stenosis.

==Causes==
It is caused by &quot;Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis&quot;—subspecies of
&quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;— a gram-negative, encapsulated, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacillus (diplobacillus), member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Frisch bacillus,&quot; named for Anton von Frisch who identified the organism in 1882. It is contracted directly by droplets or by contamination of material that is subsequently inhaled.

==Diagnosis==

A positive culture in MacConkey agar is diagnostic, but cultures are only positive in 50–60% of cases. Diagnostic characteristics are most commonly found in the granulomatous stage and are described as being plasma cells with birefringent inclusions, Russell bodies, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and groups of large vacuolated histiocytes containing &quot;Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis&quot; (Mikulicz cells).

==Treatment==
Streptomycin (1g/day) and tetracycline (2g/day) are given together for about 4-6 weeks with a repeat, if necessary, after 1 month. Rifampicin and ciprofloxacin are also shown to be effective against this organism.

Surgical treatment include rhinoplasty to correct any nasal deformities. However, if left untreated the disease can lead to sepsis, bleeding, or other chronic conditions that can be fatal.

==History==
Hans von Hebra (1847–1902) wrote the classical description of the disease in a paper published in the January 1870 issue of the Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift. Hans von Hebra was the son of Czech born dermatologist Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816–1880), founder of the New Vienna School of Dermatology. He was assisted by M. Kohn who provided much of the histology for the paper. M. Kohn is the birth name of Moritz Kaposi (1837–1902). In 1876, Jan Mikulicz-Radecki contributed to the microscopic histology. In 1882, Anton Von Frisch (1849–1917) discovered the gram-negative bacillus which causes the disease.

==Terminology==
Hebra nose. Scleroma. Fr: Sclérome. Sp: Rinoscleroma. Ger: Sklerom. Nasen-Rachenrauminduration.

Archaic terms include: Syphilis of the nose. Nasal leprosy. Scleroma neonatorum. Scleroma respiratorum. Scrofulous lupus.

<text>Top Secret Spies (German: Heimlich &amp; Co.) is a spy-themed German-style board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and published in 1984 by Ravensburger. The game, also known as &quot;Under Cover&quot; or &quot;Detective &amp; Co&quot;, won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1986.

== Gameplay ==
The object of the game is to score the most points, while not revealing which colour you are until the end. It requires good bluffing and analytical skills. 7 colours are used, and there can be up to 4 &quot;robot&quot; colours moving around. On their turn a player rolls a die and can move any number of pieces a total number of spaces that adds up to the number on the die. This can result in a score, and the game continues until one player reaches 129+ points. At this time all players make secret guesses as to which player is which colour (gaining +5 points at the end of the game for each correct answer). The game ends when a spy reaches 142+ points, and then a winner is determined after guess points are added.

== Reception ==
Upon its release the game won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1986. It is remembered in part as the first game to feature a score track encircling the board, now a common feature in many games, as well as the game that introduced thin wooden human-shaped gaming pieces (meeples). In a 1990 interview, Kramer revealed that &quot;Heimlich &amp; Co.&quot; was not one of his personal favourites.

<doc id="1126261" wikidata="Q1718542" url="?curid=1126261" title="Medism">
<text>Medism (, &quot;medismos&quot;) in ancient Greece referred to the act of imitating, sympathizing with, collaborating with, or siding with the Persians. While the term &quot;Mede&quot; was commonly used by Greeks to refer to the Persians, strictly speaking, the Medes were a distinct Iranian people who were co-rulers with the Persians in the Medo-Persian (Achaemenid) Empire. The Greeks began using the term &quot;Persians&quot; around the 470s, as evidenced by Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;The Persians&quot; in 472.

Medism was generally considered unacceptable and even criminal in many ancient Greek city-states. However, it was not specifically outlawed. In Athens, individuals suspected of medism were charged with treason. Similar attitudes can be observed in other Greek city-states as well. For instance, in Teos, a law from the classical period stipulated that anyone who betrayed the city would face the death penalty, without differentiating between betrayal to the Persians or any other group.

Prominent historical figures were implicated in medism-related controversies. Themistocles, an Athenian statesman, was ostracized for his alleged medism. Pausanias, the leader of the Hellenic League during the Battle of Plataea, was accused of medism by other member states, leading to Athens seizing control of the league. Herodotus mentioned instances of &quot;state medism&quot; in Aegina, Thessaly, Argos, Thebes, and other Boeotian cities. In Athens, astute politicians exploited popular sentiments against medism for personal gain, which resulted in a conflict between poets Timocreon of Rhodes and Simonides of Ceos, who supported and opposed Themistocles, respectively.

<text>Tantamani (, Neo-Assyrian: , ), also known as Tanutamun or Tanwetamani (d. 653 BC) was ruler of the Kingdom of Kush located in Northern Sudan, and the last pharaoh of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. His prenomen or royal name was Bakare, which means &quot;Glorious is the Soul of Re.&quot;

==Filiation==

He was the son of King Shabaka and the nephew of his predecessor Taharqa. In some Egyptological literature he is identified as the son of Shebitku. Assyrian records call Tantamani a son of Shabaka and refer to his mother, Qalhata, as a sister of Taharqa. Some Egyptologists interpreted the Assyrian text as stating that Tantamani was a son of Shebitku, but it is now more common to consider Tantamani a son of Shabaka.

==Conflict with Ashurbanipal of Assyria==


Soon after the Assyrians had appointed Necho I as king and left, Tantamani invaded Egypt in hopes of restoring his family to the throne. Tantamani marched down the Nile from Nubia and reoccupied all of Egypt, including Memphis. Necho I, and the Assyrians&#x27; representative were killed in Tantamani&#x27;s campaign.

This led to a renewed conflict with Ashurbanipal in 663 BCE. The Assyrians led by Ashurbanipal returned to Egypt in force. Together with Psamtik I&#x27;s army, which included Carian mercenaries, they fought a pitched battle in north Memphis, close to the temple of Isis, between the Serapeum and Abusir. Tantamani was defeated and fled to Upper Egypt. Forty days after the battle, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s army arrived in Thebes. Tantamani had already left the city for Kipkipi, a location that remains uncertain but might be Kom Ombo, some south of Thebes. The city of Thebes was conquered, &quot;smashed (as if by) a floodstorm&quot; and heavily plundered in the Sack of Thebes. The event is not mentioned in Egyptian sources, but is known from the Assyrian annals, which report that the inhabitants were deported. The Assyrians took a large booty of gold, silver, precious stones, clothes, horses, fantastic animals, as well as two obelisks covered in electrum weighing 2.500 talents (c. 75.5 tons, or 166,500 lb):


The sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3:8-10:
A prophecy in the Book of Isaiah refers to the sack as well:

The Assyrian reconquest effectively ended Nubian control over Egypt, although Tantamani&#x27;s authority was still recognised in Upper Egypt until his 8th Year in 656 BCE, when Psamtik I&#x27;s navy peacefully took control of Thebes and effectively unified all of Egypt. These events marked the start of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt.

==Later rule==
Thereafter, Tantamani ruled only Nubia (Kush). He died in 653 BC and was succeeded by Atlanersa, a son of Taharqa. He was buried in the family cemetery at El-Kurru. The archaeologist Charles Bonnet discovered the statue of Tantamani at Kerma (now called Doukki Gel) in 2003.

==Tomb in El-Kurru==
The tomb of Tantamani was located below a pyramid, now disappeared, at the site of El-Kurru. Only the entrance and the chambers remain, which are beautifully decorated with mural paintings.

<text>Ryan Shepard Suarez (born July 28, 1977) is an American soccer former player, who last played in United Soccer Leagues for the California Victory.

==Early career==
Born in Sacramento, Suarez graduated from Oakmont High School in nearby Roseville, California. Suarez played college soccer at San Jose State University from 1997 to 2000, and was named an NCAA All-American his senior season. He also played for the Silicon Valley Ambassadors in the Premier Development League.

==Professional career==
Upon graduating, Suarez was drafted 7th overall by the Dallas Burn in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Suarez played very well in his debut season, starting 19 games while scoring 2 goals and 3 assists, and showing an attacking instinct and physicality that looked to make him very dangerous in Major League Soccer. Although Suarez played consistently in his second season, starting 24 games and recording a goal and 2 assists for the Burn, his lack of improvement troubled many. His third season brought a move to center back, which Suarez did not take happily to – in midseason, he was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy with Paul Broome and Antonio Martínez in exchange for Ezra Hendrickson and Gavin Glinton. Suarez&#x27;s time with the Galaxy was limited by injuries, playing only 3 games. In his fourth season, with Galaxy star defender Danny Califf out for much of the year, Suarez cemented a position in the Galaxy back line, registering 25 starts for the team, but not scoring a single point. Suarez&#x27;s efforts earned him the respect of Galaxy supporters and even brought him the LA Riot Squad (LARS) Player of the Year Award. Chivas USA acquired Suarez before the 2005 season.

Chivas USA coach Hans Westerhof subbed Suarez out in the 28th minute during the team&#x27;s June 25 loss to the Kansas City Wizards; Westerhof had wanted the defense to play forward, and Suarez was not complying. A heated exchange followed, and Suarez was waived by the club two days later. He was then claimed off waivers by the MetroStars. He was released in November 2005 after playing just 4 games for the team.

In 2006, Suarez signed with Vancouver, and helped the Caps win their first USL First Division Championship by beating the Rochester Raging Rhinos 3–0.

On May 17, 2007, Suarez signed with the California Victory.

==International==
Upon his arrival in MLS, Suarez was touted as a prospect for the US national team&#x27;s right back position. His lack of development and his move to center back, however, make it unlikely that he will see much time with the team. Although Suarez had the option of playing for Uruguay, he committed himself to the United States, playing his only cap on May 26, 2003, against Wales.

<doc id="1126288" wikidata="Q2722862" url="?curid=1126288" title="Mahindra Scorpio">
<text>The Mahindra Scorpio is a mid-size SUV (in the Indian market) and Compact SUV (in the Global market) manufactured by the Indian automaker Mahindra &amp; Mahindra since 2002. It was Mahindra&#x27;s first model to be built for the global market.

The Scorpio was conceptualized and designed by the in-house integrated design and manufacturing team of Mahindra &amp; Mahindra. The car has been the recipient of three Indian awards, including the &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award from &quot;Business Standard Motoring&quot; as well as the &quot;Best SUV of the Year&quot; and the &quot;Best Car of the Year&quot; awards, both from BBC World&#x27;s &quot;Wheels&quot;.

==Development==
Prior to the mid-1990s, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra was an automobile assembly company. The company manufactured Willys Jeeps and its minor modified versions, with modifications carried out in India. In 1996, the company planned to enter the SUV segment with a new product that could compete globally. Since M&amp;M did not have the technical know-how to handle such an ambitious product, they devised an entirely new concept among Indian auto companies. They hired new executives who had worked in the auto industry in Western countries, such as Pawan Goenka and Alan Durante.

The new Mahindra Scorpio SUV had all of its major systems designed directly by suppliers, with the only inputs from Mahindra being design, performance specifications and program cost. The design and engineering of the systems were carried out by suppliers, as well as testing, validation, and materials selection. Sourcing and engineering locations were also chosen by suppliers. The parts were later assembled in a Mahindra plant under the Mahindra badge, being a well-known brand in India. Using this method, the company was able to build from scratch a new vehicle with virtually 100 percent supplier involvement from concept to reality, at a cost of Rs 600 crore ($120 million), including improvements to the plant. The project took five years to move from concept to final product. The cost was estimated in 2002 to be Rs 550 crore.

===mHawk engine===
The mHawk diesel engine is a VTG-turbocharged and intercooled four-cylinder that displaces 2.2-litres. It has a 85 mm × 96 mm (3.35 in x 3.78 in) cylinder bore and piston stroke. The engine delivers a power of and produces of torque. A Bosch common-rail direct-injection system with solenoid injectors is used. The mHawk is equipped with chain-driven overhead camshafts and hydraulic lash adjusters; its compression ratio ranges from 16.5:1 to 18.5:1 depending on the model.

== First generation (Project Scorpio; 2002) ==
=== Pre-facelift (2002–2006) ===
The Mahindra Scorpio was first launched in India on 20 June 2002. Soon after its success, the Mahindra Scorpio was later received a minor update to include plush seats, rear center armrest, dual-tone exterior color, and various minor changes. The direct injection turbo-diesel engine was all new; the NEF (New Engine Family) is square, with a bore and stroke, displaces , and produces at 3,800 rpm. To meet the upcoming Bharat 3 emissions standards in 2005, Mahindra enlisted the help of in Austria to convert the NEF engine to common rail injection, which also increased power to at the same engine speed. This engine family is also known as the 2.6 SZ.

In addition to the in-house diesel engine, the Scorpio (and Goa) was also offered with Renault&#x27;s 2-liter F4R petrol engine, producing at 5,500 rpm. Customers preferred the torquier diesel options for the heavy Scorpio and sales of the petrol-engined model were always modest.

The vehicle was sold in Europe as the Mahindra Goa with first sales in Italy in 2003. As many export markets, particularly in Europe, have a significant tax threshold at 2.5 litres, a short stroke version of the NEF displacing was made available in 2004. Power was down marginally, at for the NEF 2.5 TCI and for the NEF 2.5 CRDe. In 2006, Mahindra announced that Scorpios sold in Russia will be made as kits with a joint venture partner.

=== First facelift (2006–2009) ===
In April 2006, Mahindra launched the first facelift of the Scorpio, marketed as the All-New Scorpio. At the Auto Expo 2006 in Delhi, Mahindra also showcased their future plans on the Scorpio model by showcasing a hybrid Scorpio with a CRDe engine and a Scorpio-based pickup truck derivative. The hybrid, the first such vehicle developed in India, was developed by Arun Juara, a former employee of Ford. His senior, Pawan Goenka, a former engineer at GM, heads Mahindra&#x27;s automotive division and oversees the Scorpio project. A pickup truck version of the Scorpio was launched in India in June 2007, known as the Scorpio Getaway. On 21 September 2008, the Scorpio was updated with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

=== Second facelift (2009–2014) ===
The second facelift of the Mahindra Scorpio was largely cosmetic, with key changes including the headlight housings, bonnet and bumper designs. There were also minor increases in power and torque.

On 14 April 2009, Mahindra revealed a concept of a diesel-electric hybrid version of their Scorpio SUV at the 2008 SAE World Congress.

The Mahindra Scorpio Getaway was launched in Australia in mid-2009, marketed there as the Mahindra Pik-Up. It received additional safety features compared to the Indian model, such as ABS brakes and airbags in an attempt to raise its rating to a minimum of 3 stars from the current 2 star ANCAP rating. The 2012 model scored 6.6 points out of a possible 16, giving it a 3-star ANCAP rating.

=== Third facelift (W105) (2014–2022) ===
The Mahindra Scorpio received its facelift on 25 September 2014, featuring a redesigned front and rear fascias and a new dashboard. A revised automatic variant of the Scorpio was launched in 2015 and automatic transmission was discontinued in 2018 due to the launch of the Scorpio S11.

=== Mahindra Scorpio Classic (W110) (2022–present) ===
The current generation Scorpio will continue at the name of &quot;Scorpio Classic&quot; in two variants which is S and S11. Mahindra launched the Scorpio Classic in India on 19 August 2022. The new Mahindra Twin Peaks logo, reserved for Sport Utility Vehicles, is used, thereby replacing the old logo.

=== Safety ===
The Scorpio for India with no airbags and no ABS received 0 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Global NCAP in 2016 (similar to Latin NCAP 2013).
== Second generation (Z101; 2022) ==
The next generation of Scorpio was introduced on 27 June 2022. The prices for the same were first revealed on 21 July 2022 and bookings were open officially on July 30, 2022. It carries an &quot;N&quot; badge and is named Scorpio-N.

There is a complete overhaul in design, and the size of the new SUV is larger than its previous avatar. The petrol powertrain is 2.0-liter turbocharged, churning out power and torque. The diesel powertrain comes with two states of tune, one churning out power and torque and another power and torque (380 N.m for manual variants). The SUV is also equipped with a shift on-fly 4-wheel drive system. The Scorpio-N comes with the same engines as the Thar and the XUV700.

The cosmetics changes consists of DRL placed with the fog lamp instead of headlights. The Scorpio-N is offered in 6- and 7-seat layouts. It will have an 8-inch infotainment system powered by Sony audio with dual-zone climate control, 4xplor-4x4 and an electric sunroof.

The Scorpio-N was also launched in Australasia alongside the XUV700 in 2023. The Scorpio-N will be launched in North America and the Middle East along with the XUV700 in 2024 and other electric models in the 2027.

In February 2024 Mahindra achieved the milestone of hitting 100,000 Production Mark since the launch of Scorpio N

=== Mahindra Scorpio N&#x27;s reliability issues ===
A video of Mahindra Scorpio-N went viral in March 2023, in which the owner of the SUV took the car under a waterfall and water started entering his Scorpio N from the sunroof. This resulted in a social media debate.

=== Safety ===
====India====
The Mahindra Scorpio-N was rated five stars in adult safety and three stars in child safety by the Global NCAP under its new protocol in H2 2022 (based on Latin NCAP 2016).


====ANCAP====
ANCAP (aligned with Euro NCAP) rated the Australasian-market Scorpio zero stars in 2023 due to the lack of ADAS.

<text>The Hollywood Palladium is a theater located at 6215 Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States. It was built in a Streamline Moderne, Art Deco style and includes an dance floor including a mezzanine and a floor level with room for up to 4,000 people. The theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The Palladium was designated Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument No. 1130 on September 28, 2016.

==History==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Norman Chandler funded the construction of the art deco Hollywood Palladium at a cost of $1.6 million in 1940. It was built where the original Paramount lot once stood between Argyle and El Centro avenues, and was operated by film producer Maurice Cohen. The dance hall was designed by Gordon Kaufmann, architect of the Greystone Mansion, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Building and the Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia. He was also the architect for the Hoover Dam and early Caltech dorms.

The ballroom opened on October 31, 1940 with a dance featuring Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra and band vocalist Frank Sinatra. It had six bars serving liquor and two more serving soft drinks and a $1 cover charge and a $3 charge for dinner.

During World War II, the Palladium hosted radio broadcasts featuring Betty Grable greeting servicemens&#x27; song requests. Big Band acts began losing popularity in the 1950s, causing the Palladium to hold charity balls, political events, auto shows, and rock concerts. In 1961, it became the home of the long-running &quot;Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

From 1955 to 1976, the venue was the scene of Latin Music Orchestras for ragers sponsored by radio personality Chico Sesma titled &quot;Latin Holidays&quot;, featuring childhood friend Ray Vasquez Recording Artist, Lead Vocalist and Trombonist. The Tito Puente Orchestra performed regularly between 1957-1977 to sold-out houses of 5000.

President John F. Kennedy attended a dinner given in his honor by the California Democratic Party at the Palladium on November 18, 1961.

In 1964, it was announced that none of the jazz bands scheduled were to be paid and a riot ensued after the show was cancelled.

The Joe Loco Orchestra and show performed on the March 1965 Latin Holiday with singer/dancer Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Powell.

Pop Expo &#x27;69, referred to as a &quot;teenage fair,&quot; was a youth-oriented event held from 28 March to 6 April 1969 at the Palladium, and included performances by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and the MC5.

In 1973, Stevie Wonder performed with Taj Mahal in what was advertised as an &quot;Afrocentric concert&quot; to benefit African refugees.

Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, punk rock, rap and heavy metal concerts started to be booked at the venue. Several violent disturbances resulted, eventually leading to the Palladium closing for eight weeks, starting in February 1993.

Since 1985, the theater has been owned by Palladium Investors Ltd., a privately held group. Curfews were implemented in 1993 and a show by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was called off because of a brawl that occurred a few nights earlier. It was also used for Hollywood celebrity parties.

==Renovation and reopening==
In 2007, the owners agreed to a long-term lease to operate, manage and exclusively book the Hollywood Palladium with Live Nation, a Los Angeles-based company.

The Palladium reopened with a Jay-Z concert on October 15, 2008 after a year-long, multimillion-dollar renovation by Live Nation. The renovation included an overhaul of the venue&#x27;s interior and exterior, a new dance floor, expanded concessions, upgraded restrooms and improvements to the stage infrastructure. Jay-Z performed for nearly an hour-and-half, backed by an eight-piece band and DJ AM, who played his first show after surviving a plane crash in South Carolina. The Hollywood Palladium was also used as the memorial service site for DJ AM on September 3, 2009.

For the 2008–2009 season, a yearlong table for four cost $30,000.

===Residential expansion===
The Los Angeles City Council approved an expansion of the Palladium property parking lot in March 2016. The plan consists of two 28-story residential towers that surrounds the Palladium, standing tall and creating 731 condominiums, of store-front retail space, and a below grade-parking garage. The Towers were designed by Stanley Saitowits of Natoma Architects for developer Crescent Heights. The L-shaped design resembles and echoes the design of the Palladium.

The local AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) filed a lawsuit in 2016 citing over development and improper approval process. One of many local lawsuits filed by AHF president Michael Weinstein. In August 2018, the district court ruled all steps were taken during EIR/DEIR. The AHF filed an appeal. The AHF lost the appeal in November 2019 and Crescent Heights plans to proceed.

<doc id="1126296" wikidata="Q564251" url="?curid=1126296" title="California State Route 9">
<text>State Route 9 (SR 9) is a rural and mountainous state highway in the U.S. state of California that travels from SR 1 in Santa Cruz to SR 17 in Los Gatos, passing through the San Lorenzo Valley and the Saratoga Gap in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

==Route description==
SR 9 begins in the city of Santa Cruz where River Street intersects with SR 1. It heads north, paralleling the San Lorenzo River. The road is a winding two-lane road for the majority of its length until it approaches Fruitvale Avenue in Saratoga. SR 9 winds through the mountains north of Santa Cruz, passing through the communities of Paradise Park, Felton, Ben Lomond, Brookdale, and Boulder Creek, where State Route 236 departs from SR 9 to provide access to Big Basin Redwoods State Park. SR 236 later rejoins SR 9 near Castle Rock State Park.

At the summit of the Santa Cruz mountains (the junction with SR 35 and after a steep climb), there is a vista point offering a (somewhat obstructed) view of the Bay Area. The vista point is the route&#x27;s highest point at around . At this junction, SR 9 passes into Santa Clara County.

SR 9 descends from the mountains heading east into Saratoga as Congress Springs Road. In Saratoga, SR 9 turns southeast and becomes &quot;Saratoga-Los Gatos Road&quot;. At Fruitvale Avenue in Saratoga, SR 9 briefly becomes a four-lane highway with a large center divider. However, as the road enters Monte Sereno, it again becomes a two-lane road. This particular narrowing has caused backups in the past; however, they have become more infrequent since the completion of SR 85. SR 9 resumes being a four-lane road through downtown Los Gatos until its terminus at the junction with SR 17 (a distance of about four city blocks).

=== Usage ===
Over the years, SR 9 has been popular among car enthusiasts from all over Northern California and beyond looking to test their skills on the scenic winding highway. The experience of driving the road&#x27;s challenging curves has led to the local term &quot;9burgring&quot;, named after the Nürburgring racetrack in Nürburg, Germany.

The highway is particularly popular for recreational motorcycling. In summer months the short section between SR 35, Skyline Boulevard and SR 236, Big Basin Road becomes a popular destination for a variety of motorcycle types, and impromptu gatherings of riders in the parking lot at intersection of SR 35 and SR 9.

SR 9 is also popular with bicyclists. The section from Saratoga Village to the Saratoga Gap is notable for the number of bicycles climbing the hill on weekend mornings. Since 1978, the highway between downtown Saratoga and downtown Los Gatos is the route for the popular &quot;Great Race&quot;, when over 1,000 participants run between the two towns near the end of April.

=== Classification ===
A small portion of SR 9 towards the northern terminus is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 9 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, and, between the Los Gatos town limit and the intersection with SR 35, is officially a scenic highway, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

==History==
SR 9 was created from several previously constructed roads. One of these was a toll road built in 1848 by Martin McCarty.

In 1913, the road from Saratoga Gap southwest to Big Basin Redwoods State Park via the present SR 9 and SR 236 was added to the state highway system; it became Route 42 (an unsigned designation) in 1917. Although this highway connected to Route 44, the remainder of present SR 236, the only connection to the continuous state highway system was with the Skyline Boulevard (Route 55, now SR 35) at Saratoga Gap. This changed in 1933, when Route 42 was extended east from the gap to Route 5 (SR 17) in Los Gatos, and a new Route 116 was created, running south from Route 42 at Waterman Gap (about halfway between Saratoga Gap and the park) to Santa Cruz, intersecting the end of Route 44 at Boulder Creek.

Sign Route 9 was marked in 1934; however, it did not entirely follow the present SR 9. Initially it connected Santa Cruz with Milpitas, following Routes 116 and 42 to Saratoga, Route 114 (Saratoga Sunnyvale Road and Mathilda Avenue) north through Sunnyvale, and Route 113 (SR 237) east to Route 5 (Main Street, then U.S. Route 101E and Sign Route 13) in Milpitas. When the San Jose-Oakland US 101E designation was dropped in the mid-1930s, Route 5 between Mission San Jose (where the new SR 21 turned northeast) and Hayward did not retain a signed designation. Later SR 9 was extended north along SR 17 (which had replaced SR 13) from Milpitas to Warm Springs, SR 21 to Mission San Jose, and the independent section of former US 101E—all part of Route 5—to US 50 (also Route 5, which included a branch to Oakland) near Hayward. Except for a short realignment in the mid-1950s onto Route 69 (now I-880 and SR 262) between Milpitas and Warm Springs, this alignment remained until the 1964 renumbering.

In 1964, SR 9 was moved to its present alignment, taking over the previously unsigned Route 42 from Saratoga to Los Gatos. The route that had been signed as SR 9 became SR 85 through Sunnyvale, SR 237 to Milpitas (including previously unsigned extensions of Route 113 at each end), part of SR 17 through Warm Springs, SR 262 through Warm Springs, part of I-680 to Mission San Jose, and SR 238 from Mission San Jose to Hayward (SR 21 was already renumbered I-680 by then). SR 85&#x27;s original designation was deleted in 1994 and has since moved to a freeway and SR 17 in Warm Springs was renumbered I-880 a decade prior. However, the SR 237 freeway was built in the same location, and both SR 238 and most of SR 262 remain as surface roads.

<text>The State Scenic Highway System in the U.S. state of California is a list of highways, mainly state highways, that have been designated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as scenic highways. They are marked by the state flower, a California poppy, inside either a rectangle for state-maintained highways or a pentagon for county highways.

The California State Legislature makes state highways eligible for designation as a scenic highway, listing them in the Article 2.5 of Chapter 2 of Division 1 of the California Streets and Highways Code. For a highway to then be declared scenic by Caltrans, the local government with jurisdiction over abutting land must adopt a &quot;scenic corridor protection program&quot; that limits development, outdoor advertising, and earthmoving, and Caltrans must agree that it meets the criteria. The desire to create such a designation has at times been in conflict with the property rights of abutters, for example on State Route 174.

Any county highway that is believed to have outstanding scenic qualities is considered eligible, and the county with jurisdiction must follow Caltrans&#x27; same approval process as state highways to be declared scenic.

==California Historic Parkways==

California Historic Parkways are defined in the Streets and Highways Code, sections 280–284, as a subset of the State Scenic Highway System. Such historic parkways must have been constructed prior to 1945, and have been determined by either Caltrans or the Office of Historic Preservation in the California Department of Parks and Recreation to have historical significance. They must not at time of designation be traversed by more than 40,000 vehicles per day on an annual daily average basis. They also must be &quot;bounded on one or both sides by federal, state, or local parkland, Native American lands or monuments, or other open space, greenbelt areas, natural habitat or wildlife preserves, or similar acreage used for or dedicated to historical or recreational uses&quot;.

<doc id="1126336" wikidata="Q1291366" url="?curid=1126336" title="Hypopigmentation">
<text>Hypopigmentation is characterized specifically as an area of skin becoming lighter than the baseline skin color, but not completely devoid of pigment. This is not to be confused with depigmentation, which is characterized as the absence of all pigment. It is caused by melanocyte or melanin depletion, or a decrease in the amino acid tyrosine, which is used by melanocytes to make melanin. Some common genetic causes include mutations in the tyrosinase gene or OCA2 gene. As melanin pigments tend to be in the skin, eye, and hair, these are the commonly affected areas in those with hypopigmentation.

Hypopigmentation is common and approximately one in twenty have at least one hypopigmented macule. Hypopigmentation can be upsetting to some, especially those with darker skin whose hypopigmentation marks are seen more visibly. Most causes of hypopigmentation are not serious and can be easily treated.

==Presentation==
===Associated conditions===
It is seen in:
* Albinism
* Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis
* Leprosy
* Leucism
* Phenylketonuria
* Pityriasis alba
* Vitiligo
* Angelman syndrome
* Tinea versicolor
* Yaws
* An uncommon adverse effect of imatinib therapy
* Injections of high concentrations of corticosteroids (transient)

==Diagnosis==
Areas of lighter pigmentation can be indications of hypopigmentation. Biopsies and genetic information are also used to diagnose.

==Treatments==
Often, hypopigmentation can be brought on by laser treatments; however, the hypopigmentation can be treated with other lasers or light sources. Micropigmentation can also be used to obtain a more normal appearance of the hypopigmentated skin.

Treatment for hypopigmentation depends on the initial cause of the discoloration.

<text>Russell Dale Martin (October 4, 1960 – February 27, 2021) was an American radio personality in Dallas, Texas. He worked in the Dallas radio market for 31 years. Martin hosted the No. 1-rated &quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; on KLLI &quot;Live 105.3&quot; in Dallas, until December 8, 2008, when KLLI switched to an all-sports format. On July 12, 2010, Martin returned to radio with his afternoon (3:00p.m.7:00p.m.) show on 97.1 &quot;The Eagle&quot; (KEGL).

==Early life and career==
Martin grew up in Pleasant Grove, a large, working-class neighborhood in southeast Dallas, where he graduated from W.W. Samuell High School. Martin&#x27;s radio career began in the at KGVL in Greenville, Texas, working 6:00p.m. to midnight running the board for religious programs.

In , Martin was hired by KTLR in Terrell, Texas, to play country music on weekends. A year later, in , he was hired by KAAM in Dallas as a part-time weekend disc jockey. In , Martin was hired for another part-time position by the Satellite Music Network for an oldies format, and later worked part-time for Z-Rock while still working at KAAM and KAFM.

In Martin was hired by Top 40 station KEGL, &quot;The Eagle&quot;, in Dallas. He also hosted a talk show on Sunday nights at KEGL. He hosted the television shows Hot TV and Hot Tickets which ran from to on the then local FOX affiliate KDAF.

==&quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot;==

The first incarnation of &quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; began following the departure of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; from KEGL. In 1997 he was asked to fill morning drive time slot. Within two years, Martin&#x27;s ratings had surpassed those of Dallas veteran radio personality Ron Chapman.

In 2000, Martin left KEGL following a contract dispute. &quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; reappeared on KYNG, a station that had previously been country-western music. Martin began his first show at KYNG on April 6, 2000, once again filling the morning drive time slot. When Howard Stern was picked up by KYNG, &quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; moved from its morning drive slot to 3:00p.m.7:00p.m. In 2003, KYNG changed its call letters to KLLI and took on the Live 105.3 branding.

&quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; had consistently high ratings for KLLI since his show debuted on 105.3. In August 2005, D Magazine named Martin best radio talk show host in the DFW area.

In December 2008, Live 105.3 changed its format to include more live sports programming, and Martin was eliminated during the switch. Subsequently, his former staffer spoke out against him. &quot;Stuff he&#x27;d say to us on the air he wouldn&#x27;t say to us in the hall, because he&#x27;s a coward,&quot; says J.D. Ryan, Martin&#x27;s radio right-hand man for 25 years. &quot;To him everything was a bit, but eventually he crossed the line. It became personal. He made it clear that being successful wasn&#x27;t enough. For him to be truly happy, those around him also had to fail miserably.&quot;

On July 1, 2010, KEGL ran a promo announcing the return of The Russ Martin Show. The show began airing on July 12, 2010, in the 6:00a.m.10:00a.m. time slot.

On September 14, 2011, KEGL started airing best-of-episodes of The Russ Martin Show during the show&#x27;s daypart for an extended period of time. On September 22, 2011, KEGL&#x27;s then-program director Chris Ryan, announced the Russ Martin Show would be moving to the 3:00p.m.7:00p.m. time slot beginning September 26, 2011.

On November 17, 2014, KEGL&#x27;s sister station KFXR-AM began airing previous afternoon episodes of the show weekdays from 7:00a.m.11:00a.m.

Starting in 2016, Russ began having various medical issues and missed several shows throughout the year. Dan, Clo, and Alfie carried the show, with help from Scott West on occasion, and remained at the top of the ratings despite Russ&#x27; absences.

In addition to Russ Martin, cast members include Dan O&#x27;Malley, Clo Raborn, Alfie Coy, and Jerry Caldwell. The show has a number of recurring guests including Dr. Scott Thornton, Everett Newton, Captain Mark Howard, Mark Verma, Scott West, and Ty Jäger.

On January 15, 2020 Jerry Caldwell and Ty Jäger were released from the show as a result of sweeping iHeartRadio budget cuts.

The theme song for &quot;The Russ Martin Show&quot; is Fire and Mercy by William Orbit from the 1987 Strange Cargo album.

==Charity work==
Martin founded The Russ Martin Show Listeners Foundation in 2002, which benefits the families of police officers and firefighters who have died in the line of duty. The Foundation also coordinates an annual parade called the &quot;Heroes Day Parade&quot;. In 2006 he formed &quot;The Russ Martin Show Experience&quot;, a band made up of RMS cast members, regular guests and local musicians. The band performs rock cover songs at live venues and at an annual &quot;White Trash Party&quot; to raise money for charity. The shows benefit The Russ Martin Show Listeners Foundation.

==Interests==
Russ Martin&#x27;s interests included television show character Batman as portrayed by Adam West, as well as his fascination with James Garner and the character Jim Rockford. Martin also owned a collection of classic TV show cars such as a &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&#x27;s&quot; General Lee replica, the fastest 1966 Batmobile replica, a Munster Koach replica, and the 1976 Ford Grand Torino from Starsky and Hutch.

==Controversy==
The police of Southlake, Texas, arrested Russ Martin while at Larry North Fitness on July 18, 2008, for charges of aggravated assault-bodily injury-deadly weapon following an incident occurring on July 14, 2008, concerning his then-girlfriend Mandy Blake. Martin was accused of pulling her hair, kicking her, and brandishing a pistol. According to the arrest warrant affidavit, on July 14, Martin called the woman and asked if she had followed up about a package he sent to the IRS. When she told him she had not, the document says, he allegedly told her, among other things, &quot;You better hide, because when I get there I&#x27;m going to beat the shit out of you.&quot; His charges were later reduced to misdemeanor assault. Two weeks prior to Martin&#x27;s scheduled court date he accepted a plea bargain and pleaded no contest. Martin was placed on two years of deferred probation, and was required to complete a batterer&#x27;s intervention program to clear his record. On February 10, 2009, nearly eight months after the incident, Mandy Blake filed a complaint with the Southlake police department, claiming she had been coerced into making a statement for what she considered a very minor incident. In an interview with Janet St. James, Martin stated that no one from the DA&#x27;s office or Southlake police had ever contacted him to get his side of the story.

==Death==
Martin had battled health problems for years, including heart surgery. He was found dead at his home in Frisco, Texas on February 27, 2021. Frisco Police Department said no foul play was suspected.

<text>The Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE) of 1955–1958 was a Commonwealth-sponsored expedition that successfully completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica, via the South Pole. It was the first expedition to reach the South Pole overland for 46 years, preceded only by Amundsen&#x27;s expedition and Scott&#x27;s expedition in 1911 and 1912.

In keeping with the tradition of polar expeditions of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, the CTAE was a private venture, though it was supported by the governments of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, United States, Australia and South Africa, as well as many corporate and individual donations, under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II.

It was headed by British explorer Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. The New Zealand party included scientists participating in International Geophysical Year research while the British team were separately based at Halley Bay.

Fuchs was knighted for his accomplishment. The second overland crossing of the continent did not occur until 1981, during the Transglobe Expedition led by Ranulph Fiennes.

== Preparation ==

Preparations began in London in 1955. Over the austral summer of 1955 to 1956, Fuchs sailed with an advance party from London to Antarctica in the Canadian sealer &quot;Theron&quot;, with the purpose of establishing Shackleton Base near Vahsel Bay on the Weddell Sea, from which the trans-Antarctic expedition would begin. The &quot;Theron&quot;, like its immediate forebear, the , was trapped in the ice. Despite sustaining considerable damage, she was able to free herself with the help of the Auster Antarctic floatplane that scouted a way out. In early 1956, Fuchs sailed back to London, leaving eight men to over-winter at Shackleton.

The eight men of the advance party, led by Ken Blaiklock, were left on the ice, having only tents and a packing crate as shelter. Most of the stores were left on the bay ice, some from the site of where the base was to be set up. Their first task was to get all these stores from the bay ice to the base and to try to build some permanent shelter for the oncoming winter. Once some food and paraffin had been brought up and the dogs safely tethered by the base, the men started to build their hut. This proved to be far more difficult than had been envisaged – not only were the eight men insufficient in number to carry out the heavy tasks easily but the weather at Shackleton was colder and much windier than had been anticipated.

When the skeleton of the hut was complete, the men positioned the crates containing the wall and roof panels around the building site. Then a blizzard began, and lasted for more than a week. The temperature dropped to and the drift around the base made it impossible to do any work outside. The men sheltered in their crate and slept in their tents which were constantly in danger of getting buried by the drift. When finally the wind subsided the giant crates of wall panels had all disappeared under many feet of drift and the unfinished hut itself was full of snow. The bay ice had broken off taking all the remaining stores with it. Much food and fuel, a couple of huts and a tractor had all gone to sea.

The men tried to retrieve the crates by tunnelling under the snow; the tunnels proved to be useful kennels for the dogs protecting them from the unexpectedly severe winter conditions at Shackleton. The party of eight survived the winter with some difficulty, but in reasonably good health, and finally completed the building of the hut except for one hole in the roof, the panel for which was never found. While the hut was being constructed they lived by day in the tractor crate and slept in their tents, two men to each tent. The winter temperatures often fell well below , and Shackleton proved to be a very windy place, which made work outdoors unpleasant. All stores lying in the snow tended to get buried and there was a constant danger of them getting lost.

They managed to take a number of journeys to collect seals for the dogs and to scout a route to the south. They used dogs and the Weasel tractor, and four Tucker Sno-Cats.

== Expedition ==

In December 1956, Fuchs returned on Danish Polar vessel &quot;Magga Dan&quot; with additional supplies, and the southern summer of 1956–1957 was spent consolidating Shackleton Base and establishing the smaller South Ice Base, about inland to the south. After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a 12-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasel tractors, and one specially adapted &quot;Muskeg&quot; tractor. En route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings.

In parallel, Hillary&#x27;s team had set up Scott Base—which was to be Fuchs&#x27; final destination—on the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea. Using three converted Ferguson TE20 tractors and one Weasel, abandoned part-way, Hillary and his three men—Ron Balham, Peter Mulgrew and Ellis Williams, great uncle of the esteemed Joel David Ellis Watkins, —were responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the Skelton Glacier and across the Polar Plateau on towards the South Pole, for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey. Other members of Hillary&#x27;s team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas.
It was not originally intended that Hillary would travel as far as the South Pole, but when he had completed laying supply depots he saw the opportunity to beat the British and continued south, reaching the Pole—where the U.S. Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station had recently been established by air—on 3 January 1958. Hillary&#x27;s party was just the third—preceded by Roald Amundsen in 1911 and Robert Falcon Scott in 1912—to reach the Pole overland. Hillary&#x27;s arrival also marked the first time that land vehicles had ever reached the Pole.

Fuchs&#x27; team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid, while Hillary flew back to Scott Base in a U.S. plane. He would later rejoin Fuchs by plane for part of the remaining overland journey. The overland party finally arrived at Scott Base on 2 March 1958, having completed the historic crossing of of previously unexplored snow and ice in 99 days. A few days later the expedition members left Antarctica for New Zealand on the New Zealand naval ship . The ship was captained by Captain Harry Kirkwood.

Although large quantities of supplies were hauled overland, both parties were also equipped with light aircraft and made extensive use of air support for reconnaissance and supplies. Additional logistical help was provided by U.S. personnel who were working in Antarctica at that time. Both parties also took dog teams which were used for fieldwork trips and backup in case of failure of the mechanical transportation, though the dogs were not taken all the way to the Pole. In December 1957 four men from the expedition flew one of the planes—a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter—on an 11-hour, , non-stop trans-polar flight across the Antarctic continent from Shackleton Base via the Pole to Scott Base, following roughly the same route as Fuchs&#x27; overland party.

<doc id="1126346" wikidata="Q313312" url="?curid=1126346" title="Labarna I">
<text>Labarna was the traditional first king of the Hittites, (middle chronology), the most accepted chronology nowadays. He was the traditional founder of the Hittite Old Kingdom (fl. c. 1680(?)-1650 BC). His wife was Tawannanna.

The existence of Labarna is questioned by some modern scholars. &quot;Labarna&quot; was also a title of early Hittite rulers, such as Hattusili I. Given the relatively few contemporaneous references to Labarna personally, some scholars have suggested that pioneering Hittitologists may have erred in assuming that Labarna was the personal name of a king. According to this theory, the first &quot;Labarna&quot; (in the sense of a title) was Hattusili I, who is normally regarded as the second &quot;Labarna&quot;.

&quot;Tabarna&quot;, a variant of &quot;Labarna&quot;, is mentioned often in Hattian, Hittite, Hurrian and Akkadian texts from the Hittite archives.

== Biography ==
Labarna was not the first in line to the throne. PU-Sarruma designated Labarna as his successor after his own sons revolted against him. Upon PU-Sarruma&#x27;s death, Labarna and Papahdilmah, one of PU-Sarruma&#x27;s sons, contended for the throne, with Labarna emerging victorious.

What little is known about him is culled mainly from the Telepinu Proclamation, which states that he overwhelmed his enemies and &quot;made them borders of the sea&quot;, a statement which may refer to conquests as far as the Mediterranean coast in the south, and the Black Sea in the north.

Labarna installed his sons as governors in several cities including Tuwanuwa, Hupisna, Landa, and Lusna (the identities of these cities are uncertain, but thought to perhaps be Tyana, Heraclea Cybistra, Laranda, and Lystra). Through his conquests, he was responsible for laying the groundwork for the Hittite empire that was to come.
