<text>The Jasna Góra Monastery ( , &quot;Luminous or Light Mountain&quot;, ) in Częstochowa, Poland, is a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary and one of the country&#x27;s places of pilgrimage. The image of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, also known as Our Lady of Częstochowa, to which miraculous powers are attributed, is one of Jasna Góra&#x27;s most precious treasures. 

The site is one of Poland&#x27;s official national Historic Monuments (&quot;Pomnik historii&quot;) and is tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

==History==
Jasna Góra Monastery was founded in 1382 by Pauline monks who came from Hungary at the invitation of Vladislaus II of Opole. The new monastery was entrusted with the icon, depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child, known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa or Our Lady of Częstochowa. On 14 April 1430, Jasna Góra was sacked by the Hussites. It was originally a single-nave church, which was enlarged around 1463 to become a three-nave hall church in the Gothic style.

In the winter of 1655, the monastery was unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedish army during the Second Northern War, or The Deluge (as the Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is known). The event stimulated the Polish resistance and shortly thereafter, in the cathedral of Lwów (Lviv), on April 1, 1656, Jan Kazimierz, the King of Poland, solemnly pronounced his vow to consecrate the country to the protection of the Mother of God and proclaimed Her the Patron and Queen of the lands in his kingdom. On 16 March 1657 he visited Jasna Góra and prayed there.

Reconstruction in the Baroque style was carried out between 1690 and 1693. Between 1693 and 1696 the walls of the nave and chancel were raised, thus changing the spatial arrangement of the church from a hall to a basilica.

The monastery was again unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedes in 1702, 1705 and 1709 during the Third Northern War. In 1717 the icon of the Virgin Mary was crowned by the decision of Pope Clement XI. Between 1760 and 1772 in the monastery was imprisoned Jacob Frank, Polish-Jewish religious leader, founder of the Frankist sect, who considered himself a messiah. In 1770-1772 Jasna Góra was besiged by Russians during the Bar Confederation.

In 1909, during the Congress Poland period, thieves broke into the monastery and stole millions in rubles worth of jewels, pearls, and other valuables. The icon itself was not damaged. Crowds of praying and weeping people gathered at the closed monastery when the theft was discovered. Pope Pius X himself offered to replace the crown that was stolen, and the coronation occurred in 1910. The coronation attracted Poles from both the Russian and Austrian partitions. Special trains brought people from Warsaw, and the crowds numbered up to 60,000. A monk named Damazy Macoch confessed to the crime in 1910.

Among the monastery&#x27;s most important exhibits is the medal from the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize received by Lech Wałęsa, the former Polish president and trade-union organizer.

==Walking pilgrimages==
Every year since the Middle Ages, thousands of Poles go in pilgrim groups to visit Jasna Góra. In 2011, it was estimated that 3.2 million pilgrims from 80 countries around the world went to the shrine. Around 830,000 pilgrims took part in 228 pilgrimages organized in different places across Poland, 143, 983 of which reached the monastery on foot.
The average distance for a pilgrim group to travel is about , made in 11 days.

==Monastic etiquette==
There are typically numerous pilgrims and tourists at Jasna Góra Monastery, and the volume of excited voices can be high. However, upon entering the Monastery, it is expected etiquette for visitors to be silent or as quiet as possible out of respect. Often, there is a long line of people who wait to approach the shrine of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa. Upon arriving at the place of the shrine at which one would pass in front of the icon of Our Lady, it is expected and a sign of respect for pilgrims to drop to their knees, and traverse the anterior of the shrine on their knees.

<doc id="1124109" wikidata="Q2396202" url="?curid=1124109" title="Glider (Conway's Game of Life)">
<text>The glider is a pattern that travels across the board in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. It was first discovered by Richard K. Guy in 1969, while John Conway&#x27;s group was attempting to track the evolution of the R-pentomino. Gliders are the smallest spaceships, and they travel diagonally at a speed of one cell every four generations, or formula_1. The glider is often produced from randomly generated starting configurations.

The name comes from the fact that, after two steps, the glider pattern repeats its configuration with a glide reflection symmetry. After four steps and two glide reflections, it returns to its original orientation. John Conway remarked that he wished he hadn&#x27;t called it the glider. The game was developed before the widespread use of interactive computers, and after seeing it animated, he feels the glider looks more like an ant walking across the plane.

== Importance ==
Gliders are important to the Game of Life because they are easily produced, can be collided with each other to form more complicated objects, and can be used to transmit information over long distances. Instances of this second advantage are called glider syntheses. For instance, eight gliders can be positioned so that they collide to form a Gosper glider gun. Glider collisions designed to result in certain patterns are also called glider syntheses.
Patterns such as blocks, beehives, blinkers, traffic lights, even the uncommon Eater, can be synthesized with just two gliders. It takes three gliders to build the three other basic spaceships, and even the pentadecathlon oscillator.

Some patterns require a very large number (sometimes hundreds) of glider collisions; some oscillators, exotic spaceships, puffer trains, guns, etc. Whether the construction of an exotic pattern from gliders can possibly mean it can occur naturally, is still conjecture.

Gliders can also be collided with other patterns with interesting results. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in just the right way, the block moves closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block moves farther away. This &quot;sliding block memory&quot; can be used to simulate a counter, which would be modified by firing gliders at it. It is possible to construct logic gates such as &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot; and &quot;NOT&quot; using gliders. One may also build a pattern that acts like a finite-state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so, using the glider, the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints: it is Turing complete.

== Hacker emblem ==
Eric S. Raymond has proposed the glider as an emblem to represent the hacker subculture, as the Game of Life appeals to hackers, and the concept of the glider was &quot;born at almost the same time as the Internet and Unix&quot;. The emblem is in use in various places within the subculture.

<doc id="1124138" wikidata="Q6641545" url="?curid=1124138" title="List of streets and roads in Hong Kong">
<text>The following are incomplete lists of expressways, tunnels, bridges, roads, avenues, streets, crescents, squares and bazaars in Hong Kong.

Many roads on the Hong Kong Island conform to the contours of the hill landscape. Some of the roads on the north side of Hong Kong Island and southern Kowloon have a grid-like pattern. The roads are generally designed to British standards. Expressways generally conform to British motorway standards.

Speed limits on all roads are , unless indicated otherwise by road signs. Usually, higher speed limits such as have been raised to facilitate traffic flow along main roads and trunk roads. On most expressways, speed limits have been raised to 80 km/h and due to the smooth geometry and for North Lantau Highway, while some expressways such as Island Eastern Corridor and Tuen Mun Road have been restricted to 70 km/h because of its long existence and/or geometrical constraints. Typically, the highest speed limit in all tunnels and suspension bridges is 80 km/h, while for other roads such as toll plaza areas and slip roads that do not lead to other expressways the speed limits are recommended to be reduced to the default 50 km/h speed limit.

==Routes==
Hong Kong&#x27;s Transport Department is responsible for management of road traffic, regulation of public transport services and operation of major transport infrastructures, while Highways Department is responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of the public road system. 

In 2004, a new strategic route marking system was put in place, with most existing routes renumbered and exits to key places or to another route also numbered. (For example, a journey from Yau Ma Tei to the airport uses Route 3, taking Exit 5 to join Route 8. It is therefore identified as &quot;3-5-8&quot;.) Routes 1 to 3 are cross-harbour north–south routes following the order in which the harbour tunnels were opened. Routes 4, 5, 7 and 8 run east–west, numbered from south to north. Route 9 circumscribes the New Territories. Route 10 runs from western New Territories from Route 9 and bends northward towards and passes the border to Shenzhen. However, the new system has caused some confusion to drivers used to relying on destination signs.

The routes are designated as follows:
*Route 1: Aberdeen – Wong Chuk Hang – Aberdeen Tunnel – Causeway Bay – Cross-Harbour Tunnel – Kowloon Tong – Lion Rock Tunnel – Sha Tin (to join Route 9)
*Route 2: Taikoo Shing – Eastern Cross-Harbour Tunnel – Kwun Tong Bypass – Tate&#x27;s Cairn Tunnel – Ma Liu Shui (to join Route 9)
*Route 3: Sai Ying Pun – Western Cross-Harbour Tunnel – West Kowloon Highway – Kwai Chung – Tsing Yi – Cheung Tsing Tunnel – Ting Kau Bridge – Tai Lam Tunnel – Yuen Long (to join Route 9)
*Route 4: Chai Wan – Island Eastern Corridor – Quarry Bay – Causeway Bay – Wan Chai – Central – Sheung Wan – Sai Ying Pun – Kennedy Town
*Route 5: Ngau Tau Kok – Kowloon Bay – Airport Tunnel – Hung Hom – Yau Ma Tei – Lai Chi Kok – Kwai Chung – Tsuen Wan (to join Route 9)
*Route 6: Reserved for future route. Proposed Central Kowloon Route – Proposed Southeast Kowloon T2 Route – Proposed Tseung Kwan O – Lam Tin Tunnel
*Route 7: Tseung Kwan O – Tseung Kwan O Tunnel – Kwun Tong – Wong Tai Sin – Sham Shui Po – Lai Chi Kok – Kwai Chung (to join Route 5)
*Route 8: Chek Lap Kok (Airport) – Tsing Ma Bridge – Tsing Yi – Stonecutters Island – Lai Chi Kok – Sha Tin to join Route 9. 
*Route 9: Shing Mun Tunnel – Tai Wai – Sha Tin – Ma Liu Shui – Tai Po – Fanling – Sheung Shui – San Tin – Yuen Long – - Tuen Mun – Sham Tseng – Tsuen Wan
*Route 10: Airport – Tuen Mun, Lam Tei – Shekou, Shenzhen

<text>ActionAid is an international non-governmental organization whose stated primary aim is to work against poverty and injustice worldwide.

ActionAid is a federation of 45 country offices that works with communities, often via local partner organisations, on a range of development issues. It was founded in 1972 by Cecil Jackson-Cole as a child sponsorship charity (originally called Action in Distress) when 88 UK supporters sponsored 88 children in India and Kenya, the primary focus being is providing children with an education, further the human rights for all, assisting people that are in poverty, assisting those who face discrimination, and also assist people who face injustice. ActionAid works with over 15 million people in 45 countries to assist those people.

Today its head office is located in South Africa with hubs in Asia, the Americas and Europe. ActionAid was the first big INGO to move its headquarters from the global north to the global south. ActionAid&#x27;s current strategy aims to &quot;build international momentum for social, economic and environmental justice, driven by people living in poverty and exclusion&quot;. This includes running campaigns and providing training and resources for social movements.

== Tax and economic justice ==

ActionAid has been campaigning for tax justice since 2008, conducting research into the effects of various international tax treaties and supporting local people and organizations to hold their governments to account. It argues that losing tax revenue to avoidance harms the world&#x27;s poorest and most marginalized people, who depend on tax-funded public services. It is also often the case that the tax revenue lost in these treaties can exceed the amount of international aid money send to developing countries.

In 2011, ActionAid revealed that 98% of the UK&#x27;s FTSE 100 companies use tax havens. In 2013 its research into corporate tax avoidance in Zambia showed that Associated British Foods were avoiding paying millions of dollars in corporate tax.

== Women&#x27;s rights ==

ActionAid integrates women&#x27;s rights into all of its programming and project work, but also undertakes campaigns that focus specifically on these issues.

Notable examples have included raising awareness about unpaid care work and sexual harassment and violence (including acid attacks) in Bangladesh, offering free cancer tests to women in Nigeria who could not afford them, and tackling female genital mutilation in Sweden.

== Climate justice ==

ActionAid&#x27;s advocacy work on climate change focuses on climate justice, guided by the experiences and needs of its country&#x27;s programmes. Its most prominent engagement comes through the annual Conference of Parties, where it supports communities vulnerable to climate change to influence decision-making processes.

It calls for rich countries to live up to pledges of providing climate adaptation grants and pushes for agreements to improve the lives of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ActionAid was also critical of climate insurance policies, such as those purchased by Malawi in 2015, since those insurance policies fail to deliver when they are desperately needed.

== Emergencies and humanitarian aid ==

ActionAid promotes women&#x27;s leadership in humanitarian responses, arguing that women are best positioned to identify their needs and those of the communities around them in times of crisis. Strengthening citizens&#x27; rights is also a focus, such as campaigning with Haitians for greater transparency and accountability in how aid money was spent after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

As it has established relationships with communities and other NGOs in countries that are prone to ecological events, ActionAid is often able to respond quickly to emergencies. Notable crises and responses have included the Boxing Day tsunami in 2010 in the Indian Ocean, drought in East Africa and India, and floods in Ghana, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh and Nepal.

On 4 October 2018 ActionAid announced that Pakistan government has ordered 18 international aid groups to leave the country.

== Child sponsorship ==

Child sponsorship is one of ActionAid&#x27;s primary sources of income. Donors sponsor an individual child from a community in a developing country and receive regular updates about the child&#x27;s progress and development.

Sponsorship funds support the child&#x27;s whole community, &quot;so children have a healthy and safe place to live and grow up.&quot; This support takes the form of providing clean water, healthcare, agricultural programmes, education centres in areas where schools are not available, and community income generation schemes.

In 2018, ActionAid USA stopped using the child sponsorship method of fundraising, and switched to a monthly giving program.

== Alliance-building ==

As ActionAid has grown in influence, building alliances with like-minded organisations has become a key focus area. Announcing this approach at the World Social Forum in 2015, ActionAid has played a role in convening civil society and community groups to tackle issues of youth political participation in the Middle East and global .

==Supporting social causes through the mass media==
ActionAid made India&#x27;s first Bollywood film focusing on AIDS, &quot;Ek Alag Mausam&quot;, a love story involving HIV positive people, based on a script by playwright Mahesh Dattani.

ActionAid also supported Shyam Benegal&#x27;s film, &quot;Samar&quot;, which is based on the book &quot;Unheard Voices: Stories of Forgotten Lives&quot; by Harsh Mander. The film raises issues about Dalits.

== Notable leaders ==

Javeria Malik is the first Pakistani woman to lead the Global Safety and Security Unit at ActionAid International and was featured on the official website of International Women&#x27;s Day 2022. INSSA Insights has featured Javeria as the first female Chairperson of the International NGO Safety &amp; Security Association. Her interview published by the city security magazine was nominated for the best article of the year award. She was interviewed by Global Interagency Security Forum to speak on the topic of inclusivity and anti racism in the nonprofit and aid sector.

Marco De Ponte is currently a member of the Global Leadership Team and also at the helm of ActionAid Italia since 2001. He has led ActionAid&#x27;s expansion into new countries and is a well known civil society leader in Italy and internationally. He has previously engaged extensively, in particular as a human rights activist with Amnesty International and in the field of humanitarian assistance. He is on the coordination committee of the Italian Inequality Forum Forum Diseguaglianze e Diversità and has published extensively on issue of social justice and public policy.

<text>The Presidential Palace () is the official residence of the Polish head of state and president alongside the Belweder Palace, located in Warsaw, Poland. Originally constructed in 1643 as an aristocratic mansion, it was rebuilt and remodelled several times over the course of its existence by notable architects. The current neoclassical palace was completed in 1818.

Throughout its history, the palace was a venue for important historical events in Polish, European, and world history. In 1791, the facility hosted authors and advocates of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, the first modern European constitution. In 1818, the palace began its ongoing career as a governmental structure when it became the seat of the Viceroy (&quot;namiestnik&quot;) of Congress Poland.

Following Poland&#x27;s resurrection after World War I, in 1918, the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities and became the seat of the Council of Ministers. During World War II, it served as a &quot;Deutsches Haus&quot; for the country&#x27;s German occupiers and survived the 1944 Warsaw Uprising intact. After the war, it resumed its function as seat of the Polish Council of Ministers. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed inside the Presidential Palace between the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries. Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the president of the Republic of Poland.

==History==

=== Palace during Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: 1643—1795 ===
Construction of the present-day Presidential Palace in Warsaw was begun in 1643 by Crown Great Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, owner of the town of Brody (80 km. east of Lwów) and of numerous &quot;latifundia&quot; situated in Poland&#x27;s eastern borderlands; hence the palace&#x27;s first name was &quot;Pałac Koniecpolskich&quot;—the &quot;Koniecpolski Palace&quot;. It was said that he owned so much landed property that he could cross the breadth of the Commonwealth while spending every night in one of his own manors. The palace was not completed in the Hetman&#x27;s lifetime, as he died unexpectedly in 1646 at his Brody residence, a few weeks after taking a young wife.

The palace&#x27;s architect was Constantino Tencalla, architect to Poland&#x27;s King Władysław IV and designer of Sigismund&#x27;s Column, in front of the nearby Royal Castle, commemorating Sigismund III of Poland. The palace was completed by Koniecpolski&#x27;s son Aleksander in the style of a baroque residence, imitating those of northern Italy and Genoa. A view of the palace in a Warsaw panorama of 1656 by Erik Dahlberg confirms this.

The next owner of the palace was Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski—Grand Crown Hetman and Crown Chancellor, and later the leader of a rebellion against the king—who bought the palace from Aleksander Koniecpolski.

In 1674 the palace became, for the next 144 years, the property of the Radziwiłł family.

It was bought from descendants of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski—Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski and Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski—by Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł of the Nieśwież–Ołyka line, whose wife Katarzyna was a sister of King Jan III Sobieski. After her death, her son Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł I began renovation of the palace and tidied up its surroundings. He entrusted this task to the king&#x27;s architect, Augustyn Locci.

The next-to-last heir in tail of Nieśwież and Ołyka was Karol Stanisław &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; Radziwiłł, Voivode of Vilnius, son of Michał Kazimierz &quot;Rybeńko&quot; Radziwiłł. He had inherited huge estates from his father and uncle which made him the wealthiest magnate in Poland in the second half of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. He leased out the palace to Franciszek Ryx to house a theater which staged plays and threw masked balls. During the Four-Year Sejm of 1788–1792, he invited all the members of the four deliberating estates to dine there daily. Two meals were served every day: breakfast before the day&#x27;s session, for 300 people, and dinner after the session. One of the most impressive feasts given by him was on St. Catherine&#x27;s Day, 25 November 1789, the 25th anniversary of King Stanisław August&#x27;s coronation, and commemorating the Union of Lithuania with the Polish Crown. Four thousand guests were invited, and the feast cost over 2 million zlotys.

On the night of 2–3 May 1791, a conspiratorial group of members of the Four-Year Sejm who were bent on saving the Commonwealth met at the palace to strategize means to secure the adoption, next day, of the 3 May Constitution. This document is called &quot;the first constitution of its kind in Europe&quot; by historian Norman Davies.

=== During the partitions: 1795—1918 ===
Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł II died a sick and blind man at age 56. His property was inherited by Dominik, son of his half-brother Hieronim. Dominik, who had been wounded at the Battle of Hanau, died heirless on 11 November 1813. The line of the Nieśwież–Ołyka heirs in tail died out with him.

In 1818 the palace became the seat of the Viceroy of the Polish (Congress) Kingdom (when it acquired the name &#x27;Pałac Namiestnikowski&#x27; - the Palace of Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland). The first Viceroy, from 1815, was Józef Zajączek (1752–1820), former aide-de-champ to Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, deputy to the Four-year Sejm, secretary of the Friends of the Constitution (i.e., of the 3 May Constitution), a division commander during the Polish-Russian War of 1792, hero of the Battle of Zieleńce, a Polish Jacobin, a soldier in Jan Henryk Dąbrowski&#x27;s legions, a general of Napoleon&#x27;s. At the last he adopted a servile attitude toward Alexander I, King of Poland and Tsar of Russia, who created him a duke in 1818. Zajączek had lost a leg at the Berezina River and was carried about by his valets in an armchair.

Beginning in 1818 the palace was rebuilt in classicist style by the architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner (1756–1841). He extended the palace (its lower wings reached the line of buildings on Krakowskie Przedmieście), placed a new grand staircase between the main body of the building and its northern wing, remodeled the palace facades, and redecorated the rooms on the first and second floors of the main body of the building. Because of its massive vaulting, the ground floor remained unchanged. Aigner had two associates: Camillo Landini, who sculpted the four stone lions guarding the palace courtyard on the Krakowskie Przedmieście side, and Mikołaj Monti, an Italian painter. The main body of the building was remodeled to the Corinthian order and ornamented with columns, pilasters, balustrade and stone statues. Aigner is inseparably linked with the Viceregal (Polish: &quot;Namiestnikowski&quot;)—today, Presidential—Palace as the creator of its classicist exterior, which survives unchanged to this day.

The year 1852 brought disaster to the palace. A fire burned the main body of the building almost to the ground. Only charred walls remained. Reconstruction was entrusted to Alfons Kropiwnicki (1803–1881). The reconstruction of the palace was completed in 1856. The palace obtained the same architectural exterior as before the fire, but the interior was enriched with new decorative elements. The author of the room decorations was Bolesław Podczaszyński.

In the rebuilt palace, gatherings of the Agricultural Society were held, and balls were organized when the tsars visited Poland. In 1870, a statue of Ivan Paskevich was unveiled there. In 1879, in the palace&#x27;s colonnade hall, the inhabitants of Warsaw for the first time saw &quot;The Battle of Grunwald&quot;, a historical painting by Jan Matejko. At the turn of the 20th century, the Tarnowski Palace to the right (south) of the building was pulled down, and in 1899-1901 the luxurious Hotel Bristol was built in its place, designed by Władysław Marconi. One of the shareholders in the consortium that built the hotel was the famous pianist and post-World War I Polish prime minister, Ignacy Paderewski.

=== The Second Republic and the Present Day: 1918—Modern ===
In 1918 the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities, and renovation of the palace was entrusted to Marian Lalewicz. The building became the official seat of the chairman of the Council of Ministers (the prime minister) and of the Council of Ministers itself. The side wings housed the chancellery offices of the Council of Ministers. As restored by Lalewicz, the building was greatly admired by Warsaw&#x27;s inhabitants and visitors. Germany&#x27;s Hermann Göring, when in February 1937 calling there on Prime Minister General Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski, took such a keen interest in the palace that he arrived late to his meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck.

In 1939 the palace suffered minimal damage. In 1941–1942 it was radically reconstructed into a &quot;Deutsches Haus&quot; by the Polish architects Juliusz Nagórski and Jan Łukasik. In the course of the work, rococo ornamentation in the rooms overlooking the garden was renovated with great care. A couple of &quot;grisaille&quot; paintings were uncovered on the staircase, featuring eagle and weapon motifs. The Germans wanted to remove the eagles as Polish national emblems, but allowed them to remain after it was explained that these were Napoleonic eagles, a favorite motif of the French Empire period. On the ground floor of the right wing, a restaurant was put in, with wooden beam ceiling and a spacious cloakroom. The palace survived the Warsaw Uprising intact.

After World War II, the palace was thoroughly reconstructed by Antoni Brusche and Antoni Jawornicki. In 1965 Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s classicist equestrian statue of Prince Józef Poniatowski, which previously had stood before the now destroyed Polish General Staff building (the &quot;Saxon Palace&quot;) on nearby Piłsudski Square (once known as &quot;Saxon Square&quot;), was relocated to the courtyard before the &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s Palace.&quot;

The reconstructed palace again served as the seat of the Council of Ministers until the latter moved to its current seat at the Chancellery on Ujazdów Avenue.

Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the president of the Republic of Poland replacing the smaller Belweder palace. However, President Bronislaw Komorowski decided to move the residence back to Belweder, purportedly in honor of Józef Piłsudski and the early presidents of Poland, but the move was understood as an attempt to avoid confrontations with mourners of the late president Lech Kaczyński, killed in the April 2010 Smolensk air disaster in Russia, who were congregating in front of the palace.

<doc id="1124149" wikidata="Q656525" url="?curid=1124149" title="Ring Ring (album)">
<text>Ring Ring is the debut studio album by the Swedish group ABBA, initially credited as Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida. It was released in Scandinavia on 26 March 1973, and later in a limited number of other territories, including West Germany, Australia, South Africa and Mexico, through Polar Music. It was a chart-topping album in Belgium, and also a big success in the Netherlands, Norway and South Africa.

The album was re-released in Australasia in 1975, but was not released in the United Kingdom until 1992, and the United States until 1995.

== Overview ==
When the first song &quot;People Need Love&quot; was recorded in the spring of 1972, the group was just one of many projects the four members were involved in. Only after the title track, &quot;Ring Ring&quot; became a hit, did the four decide to go on working together as a permanent group. The original 1973 Polar version of the album opens with &quot;Ring ring (bara du slog en signal)&quot;, the Swedish version of the track, and places the English-language version as track four on side two.

The track &quot;She&#x27;s My Kind of Girl&quot;, included on the international editions, was originally recorded by Björn &amp; Benny in 1969 for the Swedish pornographic film &quot;Inga II: the Seduction of Inga&quot;. Released as a single in 1970, it became a hit in Japan, and was released as the B-side of the English version of the &quot;Ring Ring&quot; single in Scandinavia. The track &quot;Disillusion&quot; was originally written in Swedish by Agnetha Fältskog for her solo album &quot;Elva kvinnor i ett hus&quot;. Although she had composed much of her Swedish solo output, &quot;Disillusion&quot; is the only song released on an ABBA studio album to feature a songwriting contribution from her.

&quot;Ring Ring&quot; was first released on CD in Scandinavia in 1988 by Polar Music alongside &quot;Waterloo&quot; and ABBA&#x27;s self titled album. It follows the same running order as the original Scandinavian LP, being the only CD of this album to do so. Also in 1988, the international version was first released on CD in Australia by Rainbow Music Group. In 1990, the international version of the album was released on CD throughout Europe by Polydor Records with the discs manufactured in West Germany. In the United States, &quot;Ring Ring&quot; would not be made available on CD - or indeed at all - until 1995 when it was released there by Polydor. The album has been digitally remastered on CD multiple times: in 1997 as part of &quot;The ABBA Remasters&quot; series, in 2001 with an updated cover artwork and some bonus tracks, in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, and most recently in 2013 as a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;.

On 19 May 2023, a collection of vinyl products was released to celebrate &quot;Ring Ring&quot;&#x27;s 50th anniversary: a double-LP edition of the album, pressed on 180g black vinyl and half-speed mastered by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios; a 7&quot; box set of five of the album&#x27;s singles, pressed on colored vinyl; and 7&quot; picture discs of each of these singles. 

== Deluxe edition ==
On 14 October 2013, &quot;Ring Ring&quot; was reissued as a deluxe edition for its 40th anniversary. It was released as a CD and DVD set, alongside a 20-page illustrated booklet with an essay on the making of the album.

<doc id="1124163" wikidata="Q1192494" url="?curid=1124163" title="John Law's Company">
<text>John Law&#x27;s Company, founded in 1717 by Scottish economist and financier John Law, was a joint-stock company that occupies a unique place in French and European monetary history, as it was for a brief moment granted the entire revenue-raising capacity of the French state. It also absorbed all previous French chartered colonial companies, even though under Law&#x27;s leadership its overseas operations remained secondary to its domestic financial activity. 

In February 1720, the company absorbed John Law&#x27;s Bank, which had been France&#x27;s first central bank. The experiment was short-lived, and after a stock market collapse of the company&#x27;s shares in the second half of 1720, the company was placed under government receivership in April 1721. It emerged from that process in 1723 as the French Indies Company, focused on what had been the overseas operations of Law&#x27;s Company.

==Name==
Law&#x27;s Company was formally known, first, as the Compagnie d&#x27;Occident () from August 1717 to May 1719, then as the Compagnie des Indes (). It was also popularly referred to as the Compagnie du Mississippi (), for which the related stock market boom-and-bust was known as the Mississippi Bubble. 

The company was at the center of the broader monetary and fiscal scheme known as Law&#x27;s System (). Initially the System&#x27;s main entity was Law&#x27;s Bank, but the System and the Company became practically synonymous after the Bank was merged into the Company in February 1720.

==Background==

The territory of Louisiana was originally claimed for the Kingdom of France by René Cavelier de La Salle on , then including all the drainage basin of the Mississippi River (which La Salle called the Colbert River, in honor of Jean-Baptiste Colbert). The first attempt to establish a joint-stock company to develop the territory was made in 1697, but did not succeed. Other attempts failed between 1708 and 1710.

Prominent Parisian financier Antoine Crozat, who already controlled the and the associated slave trade, eventually established a Company of Louisiana () that was granted a 15-year trading monopoly in the territory by Louis XIV on . Crozat had been persuaded to engage in this venture by adventurer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, whom he appointed to lead the company. The company&#x27;s activity remained limited, however, and Crozat withdrew in early 1717 after being fined by the Chamber of Justice that had been established by Adrien Maurice de Noailles, 3rd Duke of Noailles to castigate financiers associate with the financial recklessness of Louis XIV&#x27;s late years. By then, Louisiana remained almost entirely undeveloped, with a total population of French colonists numbering only about 500.

==Compagnie d&#x27;Occident==
The Regency Council approved a proposal from Noailles to approve Law&#x27;s company on , and letters patent were issued the following week.{R|Buchan|p=144}} They granted the Company all of Louisiana as a fief in perpetuity (i.e., the Company was the vassal of the King for Louisiana), and added a 25-year monopoly on trading between Louisiana and the French mainland as well as on the beaver fur trade in Canada. They allowed the Company to have its own military force, to make treaties with native Americans, and to benefit from French military assistance in conflicts with other European powers. At the end of the initial 25-year period, the Company would retain ownership of Louisiana but would sell any military assets to the King, including forts and equipment. The company was granted a coat of arms displaying a male allegory of the Mississippi River, leaning on a cornucopia.

After some nudging by the Regent, the Parlement of Paris registered the edict on , and the King appointed Law as Director-General two days later. The shares were offered at 500 livres face value, payable entirely in government debt bills at par (which was highly advantageous, as with the initial subscription for Law&#x27;s Bank). The subscription was open to the nobility but also to commoners and foreigners. The public offering started on and extended until the end of 1718, for a total 100 million French livres at face value. Depending on accounts, it appears that Law himself subscribed between 10 million and 13.3 million livres (or 10-13.3 percent of the total), and the French state (namely the Regent, the King and four favored servants) subscribed between 30 and 40 million.

The Company soon started building up its operations. It appointed Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville as commandant-general of Louisiana&#x27;s armed forces, who in the spring of 1718 started developing a new settlement which took the name New Orleans in honor of the Regent. By December 1718, it owned a dozen ships and had made several voyages to Louisiana. It soon engaged in a series of acquisitions of tax farming rights and other colonial companies. These included the right to run the , France&#x27;s tobacco monopoly, on , and the Compagnie du Sénégal, on . The company held its first annual general meeting in the premises of Law&#x27;s Bank on rue Sainte-Avoye, on with the Regent as chair and 300 shareholders in attendance. On Law purchased the western part of the former &quot;Palais Mazarin&quot; known as the Hôtel de Nevers, and made it the company&#x27;s head office.

==Compagnie des Indes==

In May 1719, Law expanded his acquisition spree by purchasing the long-bankrupt East Indies Company, as well as the &quot;Compagnie de la Chine&quot; that had been relaunched in 1712. The Compagnie d&#x27;Occident reimbursed the two companies&#x27; debts and financed the acquisition by issuing new shares underwritten by Law &#x27;s Bank, illustrating the growing synergy between the two ventures. On , a royal edict issued by the Regent endorsed the transaction and gave the name &quot;Compagnie des Indes&quot; to the merged entity. Among other things, this gave Law&#x27;s company for the first time its own harbour, shipyard and arsenal in mainland France at Lorient, which had been developed by the East Indies Company since 1666. 

That expansion of the company&#x27;s geographical scope, by triggering the issuance of new shares, also marked the start of a momentous rise in the value of the shares, which until then had stay around their par level of 500 livres. The shares were traded in the open-air market in a section of in Paris, which had developed in the late years of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign first as a trading venue for discounted state debt bills. The price reached 750 livres on 17 June, 1,000 livres on 21 July, 2,000 livres the following week, and 3,000 livres on 17 August. The full sequence of acquisitions during the heated summer of 1719 included:
* the privilege on trade with North Africa previously held by the &quot;Compagnie d&#x27;Afrique&quot; and &quot;Compagnie du Cap-Nègre&quot;, in June-July 1719
* the right to run all royal mints for nine years, on 
* the right to run the ferme générales for nine years, which collected most excise taxes, on 
* the rights to collect all direct taxes, also in late August 1719. 

The latter two were part of a broader set of transactions that made Law&#x27;s Company the collector of all taxes and owner of all debt owed to and by the French kingdom, while still being technically a joint-stock company. Simultaneously, its privileges were extended to last a full half-century to .

The company remained profitable and solvent until the collapse of the bubble. Its value temporarily soared to the equivalent of $6.5 trillion today, which would make it the second most valuable company in history behind the Dutch East India Company. Law&#x27;s apparent success was rewarded when he was given the title Duc d&#x27;Arkansas. The popularity of company shares was such that they sparked a need for more paper bank notes, and when shares generated profits the investors were paid out in paper bank notes. In 1720, Law was appointed by Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, then Regent for Louis XV, to be Comptroller General of Finances. 

==Operations in America==

Bénard de la Harpe and his party left New Orleans in 1719 to explore the Red River. In 1721, he explored the Arkansas River. At the Yazoo settlements in Mississippi he was joined by Jean Benjamin who became the scientist for the expedition. The Mississippi Company arranged ships to bring in 800 more settlers, who landed in Louisiana in 1718, doubling the European population. Law encouraged some German-speaking people, including Alsatians and Swiss, to emigrate. They gave their names to the German Coast and the &quot;Lac des Allemands&quot; in Louisiana.

Prisoners were set free in Paris from September 1719 onwards, and encouraged by Law to marry young women recruited in hospitals. In May 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners about this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibited such deportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721.

The company was involved in the Atlantic slave trade, importing African slaves to points as far North as modern Illinois along the Mississippi River.

==Collapse and aftermath==

The market price of company shares eventually reached the peak of 10,000 livres. As the shareholders were selling their shares, the money supply in France suddenly doubled, and inflation burgeoned. Inflation reached a monthly rate of 23% in January 1720. The company further purchased the Banque Royale, in February 1720, and the and the monopoly on France&#x27;s slave trade, in September 1720. 

The &quot;bubble&quot; burst at the end of 1720. By September 1720 the price of shares in the company had fallen to 2,000 livres and to 1,000 by December. By September 1721 share prices had dropped to 500 livres, where they had been at the beginning.

By the end of 1720, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans had dismissed Law from his positions. Law then fled France for Brussels, eventually moving on to Venice, where his livelihood was gambling. He was buried in the church San Moisè in Venice.

The Company was placed in receivership in April 1721. It emerged from that process in March 1723, by which time all its operations were in Overseas trading and colonial development. It kept operating as the French Indies Company until eventual liquidation in 1770.

<text>Suakin or Sawakin (, Beja: &quot;Oosook&quot;) is a port city in northeastern Sudan, on the west coast of the Red Sea. It was formerly the region&#x27;s chief port, but is now secondary to Port Sudan, about north.

Suakin used to be considered the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea, but the old city built of coral is now in ruins. In 1983, the adjacent historic mainland town, known as the Geyf, had a population of 18,030 and the 2009 population was estimated at 43,337. Ferries run daily from Suakin to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.

==Etymology==
The Beja name for Suakin is &quot;Oosook&quot;. This is possibly from the Arabic word &quot;suq&quot;, meaning market. In Beja, the locative case for this is &quot;isukib&quot;, whence Suakin might have derived. The spelling on Admiralty charts in the late 19th century was &quot;Sauakin&quot;, but in the popular press &quot;Suakim&quot; was predominant.

==History==

===Ancient===
Suakin was likely Ptolemy&#x27;s Port of Good Hope, Limen Evangelis, which is similarly described as lying on a circular island at the end of a long inlet. Under the Ptolemies and Romans, though, the Red Sea&#x27;s major port was Berenice to the north. The growth of the Muslim caliphate shifted trade first to the Hijaz and then to the Persian Gulf.

===Medieval===
The collapse of the Abbasids and growth of Fatimid Egypt changed this and Al-Qusayr and Aydhab became important emporia, trading with India and ferrying African pilgrims to Mecca. Suakin was first mentioned by name in the 10th century by al-Hamdani, who says it was already an ancient town. At that time, Suakin was a small Beja settlement, but it began to expand after the abandonment of the port of Badi to its south. The Crusades and Mongol invasions drove more trade into the region: there are a number of references to Venetian merchants residing at Suakin and Massawa as early as the 14th century.

One of Suakin&#x27;s rulers, Ala al-Din al-Asba&#x27;ani, angered the Mamluk sultan Baybars by seizing the goods of merchants who died at sea nearby. In 1264, the governor of Qus and his general Ikhmin Ala al-Din attacked with the support of Aydhab. Al-Asba&#x27;ani was forced to flee the city. The continuing enmity between the two towns is testified to by reports that after the destruction of Aydhab by Sultan Barsbay in 1426, the refugees, who fled to Suakin instead of Dongola, were all slaughtered.

Despite the town&#x27;s formal submission to the Mamluks in 1317, O. G. S. Crawford believed that the city remained a center of Christianity into the 13th century. Muslim immigrants such as the Banu Kanz gradually transformed this: Ibn Battuta records that in 1332, there was a Muslim &quot;sultan&quot; of Suakin, al-Sharif Zaid ibn-Abi Numayy ibn-&#x27;Ajlan, who was the son of a Meccan sharif. Following the region&#x27;s inheritance laws, he had inherited the local leadership from his Bejan maternal uncles. With the decline of Mamluk power in the late 14th century, the Hedareb tribe took over the port city and made it their capital. Suakin then established itself as the most important north east African port along the Red Sea. In the fifteenth century, Suakin was briefly part of the Adal Sultanate. Suakin was sieged by the Portuguese in 1513 and captured briefly in 1541.

===Ottoman===

Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, the Ottoman Empire became the major power in the Red Sea. After a brief period of Ottoman-Portuguese struggles in the Red Sea, Özdemir Pasha occupied Suakin in the early 1550s. Though it was only loosely controlled, until the Ottoman province of Habesh was established in 1555 with the residence of its pasha in Suakin. The Ottomans restored the two main mosques - Shafi&#x27;i and Hanafi, strengthened the walls of the fort and built new roads and buildings. As the Portuguese explorers discovered and perfected the sea route around Africa and the Ottomans were unable to stop this trade, the local merchants began to abandon the town.

Some trade was kept up with the Sultanate of Sennar, but by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found two-thirds of the homes in ruins. The Khedive Isma&#x27;il received Suakin from the Ottomans in 1865 and attempted to revitalize it: Egypt built new houses, mills, mosques, hospitals, and a church for immigrant Copts.

===British rule===
The British Army was involved at Suakin in 1883–1885 and Lord Kitchener was there in this period leading the Egyptian Army contingent. Suakin was his headquarters and his force survived a lengthy siege there.

The Australian colonial forces of Victoria offered their torpedo boat HMVS &quot;Childers&quot; and gunboats HMVS &quot;Victoria&quot; and HMVS &quot;Albert&quot;, which arrived in Suakin on 19 March 1884 on their delivery voyage from Britain, only to be released as fighting had moved inland. They departed on 23 March, arriving in Melbourne on 25 June 1884. An essentially civilian military force of 770 men from New South Wales, including some of the Naval Brigade, arrived in Suakin in March 1885 and served until mid-May.

After the defeat of the Mahdist State, the British preferred to develop the new Port Sudan, rather than engage in the extensive rebuilding and expansion that would have been necessary to make Suakin comparable. By 1922, the last of the British had left.

=== 21st century ===
Since 2000, Sudan&#x27;s National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums has undertaken research and documented the history of Suakin, and in 2022, the online project Sudan Memory published historical photographs, architectural drawings and a 3D reconstruction of the town on its website.

On 17 January 2018, as part of a rapprochement with Sudan, Turkey was granted a 99-year lease over Suakin island. Turkey plans to restore the ruined Ottoman port city on the island.

On 12 June 2022, some 15,000 sheep drowned in the sinking of the &quot;Badr 1&quot; in the port of Suakin.

==Buildings of Suakin==
A detailed description of the buildings of Suakin, including measured plans and detailed sketches, can be found in &quot;The Coral Buildings of Suakin: Islamic Architecture, Planning, Design and Domestic Arrangements in a Red Sea Port&quot; by Jean-Pierre Greenlaw, Kegan Paul International, 1995, .

==Climate==
Suakin has a very hot desert climate (Köppen BWh) with brutally hot and humid, though dry, summers and very warm winters. Rainfall is minimal except from October to December, when easterly winds can give occasional downpours: in November 1965 as much as fell, but in the whole year from July 1981 to June 1982 no more than was recorded.

<doc id="1124178" wikidata="Q2459298" url="?curid=1124178" title="Tugen people">
<text>The Tugen are a sub tribe of the Kenyan Kalenjin people. They fall under the highland &quot;nilotes&quot; category. They occupy Baringo County and some parts of Nakuru County and Elgeyo Marakwet County in the former Rift Valley Province. Daniel Arap Moi, the second president of Kenya (1978–2002), came from this sub-tribe. The Tugen people speak the Tugen language. The Tugen population was 197,556 as of 2019.

== Culture ==
Tugen is more diverse in culture and language than other Kalenjin sub tribes. It was divided as Aror, Lembus,Torois and Samor. Aror and Samor follow Tugen circumcision rites and Lembus and Torois followed Nandi circumcision rights. Aror have a strong connections with Marakwet people while Samor have connections with Lembus and Nandi. The Lembus and Torois later disowned that they are Tugen and won court case. Under population census 2019 they were counted separately.

== History ==
The oral traditions of the Tugen indicate three areas of origin located north, west and east of remaining Tugen homelands. The bulk of the population originated from the west, from Sumo, which is located between Mount Elgon and Cherangany Hills. The northern and eastern migrations came from Suguta (Lake Turkana) and Koilegen (Mount Kenya) and brought with them non-Kalenjin speaking people from northern Kenya and the highlands to the East of the Rift Valley, respectively. Folklore states that some Tugen are remnants of Masaai pastoralists.

== Demographics ==
The Tugen are subdivided into two subgroups known as Arror and Samor:
* Arror live in the Highlands of Kabartonjo and the lowlands of Kerio Valley (Barwessa) and Lake Baringo of North Baringo District.
* Samor who live in Kabarnet,Sacho, Ewalel,and Kapropita in Central Baringo district. This is the group from which the second president of Kenya, Daniel Toroitich Aarap Moi comes.
Initially Lembus and Torois was part of Samor. 
* Lembus Who mostly live in Eldama Ravine constituency, Mogotio constituency, Nakuru constituency, Tenges ward and part of Keiyo
* Torois Who mostly live in Baringo South and Mogotio Constituencies, Baringo County.

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===
Traditionally, like other Kalenjin people, the Tugen prayed to Asis ( symbolized by life giving force, the sun). Other attributes to Asis are Chepokipkoyo (god of harvest), Cheptengeryan (god of love), and Cheponamoni. Most have converted to Christianity. Islam flourished in major town. Tugens are now moving back to the original Asisianism spirituality

=== Age-sets ===
Tugen social organisation centres on the age set, or ipindo. The seven age-sets (&quot;ipinwek&quot;) are rotational, meaning at the end of one age-set new members of that generation are born.

Some Kalenjin peoples, include an age-set called Maina. However, among the Tugen, this age-set is extinct. Legend has it that the members of this &quot;ipindo&quot; were wiped out by the Keiyo, in a skirmish near Cheploch gorge. To avoid a recurrence, the community decided to retire the age-set.

&quot;Ipindo&quot; was given out at initiation. By simple arrangements, there ought to be one &quot;ipindo&quot; between father and son. For example, a &quot;korongoro&quot; cannot beget a &quot;kipkoimet&quot;. Tugen don&#x27;t consider a woman to have an age-set, hence she can marry any age-set except her father&#x27;s. The Tugen say &quot;ma tinyei ipin Korgo,&quot; meaning they can marry any age-set, but they have their own age-set such as &quot;chesiran&quot;, &quot;masinya&quot;, and &quot;chepigwek&quot;. Age-sets:

*Chumo
*Sawe
*Korongoro
*Kipkoimet
*Kaplelach
*Kipnyigei
*Nyongi

=== Age sub-set (&quot;siritie&quot;) ===

In each age-set, initiates are bundled into &quot;siritie&quot; or what can be understood as a &#x27;team&#x27;. There are three &quot;siritoik&quot; in an age-set (&quot;ibindo&quot;) namely:

*Chongin
*kapchepsuei
*Barnot (youth)

== Notables ==
* Daniel Arap Moi
* Gideon Moi
* Benjamin Chesire Cheboi, the first governor of Baringo County
* Paul Tergat world marathon champion
* Reuben Chesire - politician, businessman, farmer

<doc id="1124195" wikidata="Q203892" url="?curid=1124195" title="Visaginas">
<text>Visaginas () is a city in northeastern Lithuania. It is the centre of Lithuania&#x27;s youngest municipality, located on the north-eastern edge of the country. It was built as a town for workers engaged in the construction of the now decommissioned Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. Visaginas is the only city in Lithuania where the majority of population speaks Russian as their first language. Originally the aerial view of Visaginas was designed to resemble a butterfly. However, after work on the nuclear power plant was cancelled, so was further construction of the town. Currently Visaginas consists of three residential regions that locals refer to as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Microdistricts. Visaginas has 14 streets. The city grew up in a pine forest by Lake Visaginas. Tourism is currently an area of great potential, as is the possibility of a new nuclear power plant.

The administrative centre of Visaginas municipality is situated near the country&#x27;s biggest lake, Drūkšiai. Its administrative boundaries are in the process of being defined. The Vilnius–Daugavpils (Latvia) railway runs alongside the city, providing convenient communication with those cities.

==History==
Before World War II, from 1922 to 1939, the area of modern Visaginas lay within the boundaries of the Gmina Smołwy in the Brasław County of the Wilno Voivodeship in Poland.

The settlement was founded in 1975 as Sniečkus, a town for workers at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant on the shores of Lake Visaginas. It was established in place of four villages that were demolished, the largest of which was known as Visaginas. The new town was named after Antanas Sniečkus, a former first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party, and was granted the status of an urban-type settlement. Following the restoration of independence, the city was renamed to Visaginas in 1992 and received municipal rights in 1995. It is governed by a city council, which elects the mayor. In 1996, the city&#x27;s coat of arms was confirmed by a decree of the President of Lithuania.

The settlement was developed in complexes, with construction designed to create an infrastructure for the cultural and everyday life of the residents. Efforts were made to preserve the natural surroundings as much as possible.

<doc id="1124203" wikidata="Q3366196" url="?curid=1124203" title="Worker-communist Party of Iran – Hekmatist">
<text>The Worker-communist Party of Iran – Hekmatist is an opposition Iranian political party in exile. Its current secretary of central committee is Naser Moradi and its current Chair of the Politburo is Siavash Daneshvar.

==History==
The WPI-Hekmatist was formed in 2004 after a major split from the Worker-communist Party of Iran (WPI). More than half of the WPI&#x27;s Central Committee and almost all of its Kurdistan Committee joined the WPI-Hekmatist. The leadership of Worker-Communist Party of Iraq also supported this move and it is now the sister party of the WPI-Hekmatist. The other split was in 2012 under the same name Worker-Communist Party-Hekmatist.

The group claims to hold more closely to the line of Mansoor Hekmat, the WPI&#x27;s founder, but this claim has been denied by the WPI leadership and the dispute between the two parties is still ongoing.
WPI-H denounce the WPI leadership as enacting a &quot;retreat to the traditional Left&quot; and the WPI leadership call the WPI-H &quot;a right-wing split&quot; and sometimes in sarcasm &quot;Anti-Hekmatist&quot; or more recently &quot;UnHekmatist&quot;.

The Hekmatist party has declared it to be their goal to establish a modern Communist mass party in Iran and organize a Socialist revolution as Marx had formulated it. They distinguish themselves from other &quot;traditional Left&quot; groups by emphasizing their organization&#x27;s focus on an immediate task (to the vanguard of the social movement for a Socialist revolution), rather than merely being an &quot;intellectually-enlightning sectarian organization&quot;.

<doc id="1124209" wikidata="Q498007" url="?curid=1124209" title="Mu of Baekje">
<text>King Mu (581?–641) (r. 600–641) was the 30th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the 4th son of King Wideok.

== Background ==
During his reign, the Three Kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) were at war with each other, as alliances shifted and the neighboring China also experienced a change of dynasties.

Because reliable historical sources are hard to find for the Three Kingdoms period, the specifics of Mu&#x27;s policies are not known.

== Reign ==
Early in his reign, Mu attacked Silla several times. He also requested assistance from the Sui dynasty of China to attack Goguryeo. Following the Goguryeo–Sui War, the Sui was replaced by the Tang dynasty in China in 618.

In 627, he attempted to recover land lost to Silla, but stopped when Tang intervened diplomatically. The same year, he sent the Buddhist monk Gwalleuk to Japan with texts on Buddhism, astronomy, history, and geography.

He formally established the Mireuksa temple in 602. He is also said to have ordered the repair of Baekje&#x27;s Sabi Palace in 630, and the construction near his palace of the earliest known artificial lake in Korea. His policies in the latter half of his reign, which emphasized construction projects at the expense of national defence, are often thought to have contributed to the fall of Baekje, which took place twenty years after his death.

There is reason to believe that he moved the capital of Baekje from Sabi in Buyeo County to Iksan, at least briefly. Archaeological evidence in Iksan, including tombs attributed to Mu and his wife Queen Seonhwa, appears to confirm this.

Analysis of the human bones showed that King Mu died around the age of 60, his height was between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 7 inches (161-170.1 cm), and his year of death is estimated to be between 620 and 659.

Mu retained close ties with Tang China, but Tang later allied with Silla in the wars that ultimately unified the Korean Peninsula under Silla&#x27;s rule by 668.

==Seodong-yo==
The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; relates a legend regarding Mu&#x27;s marriage to a princess of Silla, although historians consider it unlikely to be true, given the hostilities between the rival kingdoms. In this story, the young Seodong (Mu&#x27;s childhood name) falls in love with Silla princess Seonhwa, and intentionally spreads a song about the princess and himself among the people. Thanks to this song (&quot;Seodong-yo,&quot; or &quot;Seodong&#x27;s Song&quot;), King Jinpyeong of Silla banishes the princess, and Mu marries her and becomes the king of Baekje.

==Family==
* Father: Wideok of Baekje
* Mother: Yeon Gamo
** Brother: Jin&#x27;ni-Ō (辰爾王, ?–?) – settled in Japan and became ancestor of the Ōuchi clan and Toyota clan.
** Queen: Queen Sataek (沙宅王后, d. 642/55) – daughter of Minister Sataek Jeokdeok (沙宅積德).
*** 31st king, Uija of Baekje (義慈王, 599–660) – last king of Baekje, known as Buyeo Uija (扶餘義慈) before he became king.
** Queen: Princess Seonhwa (, ?–?) – daughter of King Jinpyeong of Silla.
*** Buyeo Gyogi (扶餘翹岐, ?–?) – banished to Japan in 642.

==In popular culture==
* Portrayed by Kim Seok and Jo Hyun-jae in the 2005-06 SBS TV series &quot;Ballad of Seodong&quot;.
* Portrayed by Choi Jong-hwan in the 2011 MBC TV series &quot;Gyebaek&quot;.

<text>Jonathan Haradan (November 11, 1744 – November 23, 1803) was a privateer during the American Revolution.

== Biography ==
Haradan was born in 1744 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. As a boy he worked in Salem for the prominent merchant and future Senator George Cabot. He joined the Massachusetts State Navy in July 1776 as First Lieutenant of the sloop-of-war &quot;Tyrannicide&quot;, fourteen guns. On board for two years, he captured many prizes, becoming her commander in 1777. The ship was scuttled during the Penobscot Expedition.

In 1778, Haraden began his career as a privateersman, commanding the &quot;General Pickering&quot;, sloop of fourteen guns. On October 13, 1779, he engaged three British privateers off New Jersey simultaneously and captured a twenty-two gun sloop in the Bay of Biscay. When the larger British privateer, &quot;Achilles&quot; of forty guns, attempted to recapture the sloop a few days later, Haraden forced it to disengage after three hours&#x27; action at close quarters. In 1781, he was briefly captured by Admiral George Rodney in the West Indies, but escaped. Haraden sailed privateer &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1782.

After the War of Independence, Haraden&#x27;s health deteriorated steadily. He died in Salem, Massachusetts in 1803. He was buried in Salem&#x27;s Broad Street Cemetery.

=== Legacy ===
* Two destroyers of the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Haraden&quot; for him.

<text>Oulton Broad refers to both the lake and the suburb of Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.

The suburb is located west of the centre of Lowestoft. It became a civil parish in 2017. It had an estimated population of 10,338 at the 2011 United Kingdom census.

==Oulton Broad==
Oulton Broad is an expanse of water and marsh which forms part of the network of man-made bodies of water known as The Broads. It is believed to be the remnant of medieval peat cutting. To the east it is linked by Mutford Lock to the saltwater Lake Lothing which passes through the centre of Lowestoft and flows into the North Sea. To the west it is linked by Oulton Dyke to the River Waveney.

The Broad is the most southern area of open water in the Broads system, and is a busy tourist and sporting centre. It is used for a variety of watersports, including powerboat racing, and as the base for boat hire. Facilities include a yacht station and moorings as well as a &#x27;village&#x27; of holiday chalets. Nicholas Everitt Park has an extensive water frontage. It is one of the few broads with residential areas adjacent, with houses to the north and flats to the east. The north side of the Broad is one of the most expensive residential areas in Lowestoft, with large detached houses having lake frontage.

While the eastern and north shores of the Broad are built up, the west and south-west are quiet and natural. This part of the lake can be reached on foot by walking through Nicholas Everitt Park and then by public footpaths and field across White Cast Marshes, an important nature conservation area.

==Oulton Broad village==
Oulton Broad first became a civil parish in 1904, having previously been split between Oulton, to the north, and Carlton Colville to the south. It lost its parish status in 1919, at which point it was absorbed into Lowestoft. Following the expansion of Lowestoft in the late 1950s, both Oulton Broad and its neighbouring parishes were merged with the town. The parish extends either side of Lake Lothing and the Broad, with Bridge Road as its main shopping street.

Oulton Broad is served by two railway stations: on the Wherry Lines between and , and on the East Suffolk Line between Lowestoft and .

===Nicholas Everitt Park===
Nicholas Everitt Park is on waterfront on the south side of Oulton Broad. Lowestoft Museum in the park was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It houses one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of Lowestoft porcelain. The Waveney and Oulton Broad Yacht Club is also located in Nicholas Everitt Park.

==Notable people==
After marrying in 1840 the writer, traveller, and walker George Borrow moved to his wife&#x27;s estate in Oulton Broad. In between travels he wrote several books there. During the 1850s he moved away, but returned to Oulton Broad in 1874 where he stayed until his death in 1881. A hotel in the area was named after him, and now houses the head office of Hayden Chemists.

Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson, a keen yachtsman and canoeist, lived in his last years on a houseboat moored at Oulton Broad, called &quot;Fox&quot;, up until the month before his death in 1927. He and his wife entertained, especially during the yachting season, and he encouraged the Royal Canoe Sailing Club to hold competitions on the Broad.

<text>The Left Worker-communist Party of Iraq () is a small political party in Iraq, formed in 2004.

The party was formed by a group of communists, some of whom were members in the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq soon after the WCPIraq decided to support the Worker-Communist Party of Iran - Hekmatist; the Left tendency was to desire to maintain links with the Worker-Communist Party of Iran, believing that group held to a clear revolutionary and socialist position and maintained the line of Worker Communism as laid out by its founder, Mansoor Hekmat.

The current leader of LWPI is Issam Shukri. He is also a member of Central Committee and Politburo of WPI.

<text>Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Limerick, is a cathedral of the Church of Ireland in Limerick, Ireland, which is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin. Previously the cathedral of the Diocese of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe, it is now one of six cathedrals in the Diocese of Tuam, Limerick and Killaloe.

==From the foundation to the Irish Reformation==

Limerick Cathedral (Saint Mary&#x27;s) is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and was founded in 1168 and is the oldest building in Limerick which is in use. It has the only complete set of misericords left in Ireland.

In 1111, the Synod of Ráth Breasail decided that &quot;Saint Mary&#x27;s church&quot; would become the cathedral church of the Diocese of Limerick. According to tradition, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, the last King of Munster, founded the present cathedral on the site of his palace on King&#x27;s Island in 1168. The palace had been built on the site of the Viking meeting place, or &quot;Thingmote&quot; – the Vikings&#x27; most westerly European stronghold. This had been the centre of government in the early medieval Viking city. Parts of the palace may be incorporated into the present structure of the cathedral, most prominently the great west door, which is claimed to have been the original main entrance to the royal palace. The bishops of Limerick have for centuries knocked on this door and entered by it as part of their installation ceremony. According to tradition, during the many sieges of Limerick the defenders of the city used the stones around the west door to sharpen their swords and arrows, and the marks they made in the stonework can be seen there today.

The tower of Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral was added in the 14th century. It rises to 36.58 metres (120 feet), containing a peal of 8 bells, of which 6 were cast by John Taylor &amp; Co, Loughborough, and 2 cast in Whitechapel, London. The tower also contains a stationary service bell, which can be rung from the ground floor.

==Notable burials==
The cathedral graveyard contains many graves and tombs of notable people. The physician Samuel Crumpe is buried in the graveyard near the great west door. Prince Milo of Montenegro, Frances Condell (first woman Mayor of Limerick) and Bishop Charles Graves are also interred in the grounds. The last High King of Munster, Domnall was purportedly buried in the cathedral, with the remnants of his stone coffin still visible in the Cathedral chancel. Bishop Cornelius O&#x27;Dea is buried alongside several other Bishops of Limerick in what is believed to be an Episcopal vault underneath the chancel itself. Also notable are the Sexton, Barrington, Boyd and Vanderkiste tombs along the south entrance pathway.

==From the Irish Reformation to the 19th century==

There are five chandeliers which hang from the ceiling. These are only lit on special occasions. The larger three of the five were made in Dublin and presented in 1759 by the Limerick Corporation. The belfry holds a peal of eight bells, six of which were presented by William Yorke, mayor of Limerick, in 1673. An active team of bell ringers travels the country to compete with other campanologists.
Saint Mary&#x27;s received its organ in 1624, when Bishop Bernard Adams donated one. It has been rebuilt over the centuries and was most recently renovated in 1968 and 2005.

In 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon, a resident of Limerick, wrote a flattering description of the cathedral:

&quot;not large, but lightsome, and by the providence of the Bishop fairly beautified within, and as gloriously served with singing and organs&quot;.

During the Irish Confederacy wars, the cathedral was briefly transferred to Roman Catholic hands. The bishop of Limerick, Richard Arthur, was buried in the cathedral in 1646.In 1651, after Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces captured Limerick, the cathedral was used as a stable by the parliamentary army. This misuse was short lived, but was a similar fate to that suffered by some of the other great cathedrals during the Cromwellian campaign in Ireland. The troops also removed the cathedral&#x27;s original 4 metre (13 foot) Pre-Reformation high altar from the cathedral. The altar was only reinstated in the 1960s. It is the largest such altar in Ireland and the UK, carved from a single limestone block. The altar is used for communion services at major festivals and remains in its historic location in what is now the chapel of the Virgin Mary or Lady Chapel.

In 1691, the cathedral suffered considerable damage, particularly on the east end, during the Williamite Siege of Limerick. After the Treaty of Limerick, William granted £1,000 towards repairs. There are cannonball from 1691 in the Glentworth Chapel/Saint George&#x27;s Chapel inside.

==From the 19th century to the 20th century==
In 1968, the Irish Government commissioned two postage stamps to commemorate the cathedral&#x27;s 800 year anniversary. A picture of one of the stamps is displayed on this page. In 1991, there was a large £2.5 million restoration programme which was completed in 1996 with the excavation and re-laying of the floors as well as the installation of underfloor central heating. Restoration continues today to a lesser degree.

==From the 20th century to the 21st century==
Today, the cathedral is still used for its original purpose as a place of worship and prayer for everybody. It is also the 3rd biggest tourist attraction in Limerick. It is open to the public every day from 9:00 am to 4:45 pm. For Tourists there is a €5 admission charge upon entry. This money is essential for the upkeep of the building, and without it, the cathedral simply could not function.

Following the retirement of the Very Rev&#x27;d Maurice Sirr on 24 June 2012, Bishop Trevor Williams announced the appointment of the Reverend Sandra Ann Pragnell as Dean of Limerick and Rector of Limerick City Parish. She was the first female dean of the cathedral and rector of Limerick City Parish, and retired in January 2017.

It was announced on 27 August 2017, that the Reverend Canon Niall James Sloane was to become the 63rd Dean of Limerick and the new rector of Limerick City Parish; with his installation and institution taking place on 21 October 2017 in the cathedral.

The cathedral grounds holds a United Nations Memorial Plaque with the names of all the Irish men who died while serving in the United Nations Peacekeepers.

<text>A compact newspaper is a broadsheet-quality newspaper printed in a tabloid format, especially one in the United Kingdom. The term as used for this size came into use after &quot;The Independent&quot; began producing a smaller format edition in 2003 for London&#x27;s commuters, designed to be easier to read when using mass transit.

Readers from other parts of the country liked the new format, and &quot;The Independent&quot; introduced it nationally. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; copied the format as &quot;The Independent&quot; increased in sales. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; are now printed exclusively in compact format following trial periods during which both broadsheet and compact version were produced simultaneously. &quot;The Independent&quot; published its last paper edition on 20 March 2016 and now appears online only.

<doc id="1124238" wikidata="Q178544" url="?curid=1124238" title="Swedish football league system">
<text>The Swedish football league system is a series of interconnected leagues for club football in Sweden which is controlled by the Swedish Football Association and consists of 288 teams in 22 leagues divided into five levels. Below those five levels, additional regional levels numbered six to ten exist but these lower leagues are controlled by the regional associations and not by the nationwide association. There is, however, promotion and relegation to and from all levels. there were a total of 2510 teams in the Swedish league system of which 299 of them were reserve teams.

==Current system in men&#x27;s football==

===2019===
The table below shows how the current system works. For each division, its Swedish name and number of clubs is given. It is not certain that each division is a feeder of teams to the division that lie directly above it and relegates teams to the divisions that lie directly below it, even though this usually is the case. As of the 2018 season, both &quot;Norra&quot; and &quot;Södra&quot; leagues of Ettan are composed of 16 clubs, similar to Allsvenskan and Superettan. For level 6 to level 9, the number of clubs are as of 2013.

==Current system in women&#x27;s football==
In 2013 the two second tier divisions were combined in the new Elitettan.

<text>The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements is a non-fiction book authored by the American social philosopher Eric Hoffer. Published in 1951, it depicts a variety of arguments in terms of applied world history and social psychology to explain why mass movements arise to challenge the &quot;status quo&quot;. Hoffer discusses the sense of individual identity and the holding to particular ideals that can lead to extremism and fanaticism among both leaders and followers.

Hoffer initially attempts to explain the motives of the various types of personalities that give rise to mass movements in the first place and why certain efforts succeed while many others fail. He goes on to articulate a cyclical view of history such that why and how said movements start, progress and end is explored. Whether intended to be cultural, ideological, religious, or whatever else, Hoffer argues that mass movements are broadly interchangeable even when their stated goals or values differ dramatically. This makes sense, in the author&#x27;s view, given the frequent similarities between them in terms of the psychological influences on its adherents. Thus, many will often flip from one movement to another, Hoffer asserts, and the often shared motivations for participation entail practical effects. Since, whether radical or reactionary, the movements tend to attract the same sort of people in his view, Hoffer describes them as fundamentally using the same tactics including possessing the rhetorical tools. As examples, he often refers to the purported political enemies of communism and fascism as well as the religions of Christianity and Islam.

The first and best-known of Hoffer&#x27;s books, &quot;The True Believer&quot; has been published in twenty-three editions between 1951 and 2002. He later touched upon similar themes in other works. Prominent leaders and social commentators who have remarked publicly about their interest in the book include American President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as American Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton.

Although receiving widespread popular acclaim, the socio-political debate spurred on by the book in terms of academic analysis and commentary has been ongoing. The core thesis of the interchangeability of mass movements and the inherent weakness within them that can cause adherents to slide into dogma and absolutism has attracted significant challenge; multiple scholars have used historical examples of solid group identities that rarely became interchangeable with other communities. Hoffer himself stated that he intended his analysis not to inherently condemn all mass movements in all contexts, particularly citing figures such as Jesus of Nazareth as those who promoted positive ideals. However, he continued to stress the central argument of his work.

==Summary==
===Part 1. The Appeal of Mass Movements===
Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread &quot;desire for change&quot; from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are &quot;irredeemably spoiled&quot; and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek &quot;self-renunciation&quot;. Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective. Leaders are vital in the growth of a mass movement, as outlined below, but for the leader to find any success, the seeds of the mass movement must already exist in people&#x27;s hearts.

While mass movements are usually some blend of nationalist, political and religious ideas, Hoffer argues there are two important commonalities: &quot;All mass movements are competitive&quot; and perceive the supply of converts as zero-sum; and &quot;all mass movements are interchangeable&quot;. As examples of the interchangeable nature of mass movements, Hoffer cites how almost 2000 years ago Saul, a fanatical opponent of Christianity, became Paul, a fanatical apologist and promoter of Christianity. Another example occurred in Germany during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Communists and Fascists were ostensibly bitter enemies but in fact competed for the same type of angry, marginalized people; Nazis Adolf Hitler and Ernst Röhm, and Communist Karl Radek, all boasted of their prowess in converting their rivals.

===Part 2. The Potential Converts===
The &quot;New Poor&quot; are the most likely source of converts for mass movements, for they recall their former wealth with resentment and blame others for their current misfortune. Examples include the mass evictions of relatively prosperous tenants during the English Civil War of the 1600s or the middle- and working-classes in Germany who passionately supported Hitler in the 1930s after suffering years of economic hardship. In contrast, the &quot;abjectly poor&quot; on the verge of starvation make unlikely true believers as their daily struggle for existence takes pre-eminence over any other concern.

Racial and religious minorities, particularly those only partly assimilated into mainstream culture, are also found in mass movements. Those who live traditionalist lifestyles tend to be content, but the partially assimilated feel alienated from both their forebears and the mainstream culture (&quot;the orthodox Jew is less frustrated than the emancipated Jew&quot;).

A variety of what Hoffer terms &quot;misfits&quot; are also found in mass movements. Examples include &quot;chronically bored&quot;, the physically disabled or perpetually ill, the talentless, and criminals or &quot;sinners&quot;. In all cases, Hoffer argues, these people feel as if their individual lives are meaningless and worthless.

Hoffer argues that the relatively low number of mass movements in the United States at that time was attributable to a culture that blurred traditionally rigid boundaries between nationalist, racial and religious groups and allowed greater opportunities for individual accomplishment.

===Part 3. United Action and Self-Sacrifice===
In mass movements, an individual&#x27;s goals or opinions are unimportant. Rather, the mass movement&#x27;s &quot;chief preoccupation is to foster, perfect and perpetuate a facility for united action and self-sacrifice&quot;. Mass movements have several means.

Mass movements demand a &quot;total surrender of a distinct self&quot;. One identifies the most as “a member of a certain tribe or family,&quot; whether religious, political, revolutionary, or nationalist. Every important part of the true believer&#x27;s persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community; even when alone, the true believer must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies this communal sensibility as the reappearance of a &quot;primitive state of being&quot; common among pre-modern cultures. Mass movements also use play-acting and spectacle designed to make the individual feel overwhelmed and awed by their membership in the tribe, as with the massive ceremonial parades and speeches of the Nazis.

While mass movements idealize the past and glorify the future, the present world is denigrated: &quot;The radical and the reactionary loathe the present.&quot; Thus, by regarding the modern world as vile and worthless, mass movements inspire a perpetual battle against the present.

Mass movements aggressively promote the use of doctrines that elevate faith over reason and serve as &quot;fact-proof screens between the faithful and the realities of the world&quot;. The doctrine of the mass movement must not be questioned under any circumstances. Examples include the Japanese holdouts, who refused to believe that the Second World War was over, or the staunch defenders of the Soviet Union, who rejected overwhelming evidence of Bolshevik atrocities.

To spread and reinforce their doctrine, mass movements use persuasion, coercion, and proselytization. Persuasion is preferable but practical only with those already sympathetic to the mass movement. Moreover, persuasion must be thrilling enough to excite the listener yet vague enough to allow &quot;the frustrated to... hear the echo of their own musings in the impassioned double talk&quot;. Hoffer quotes Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels: &quot;a sharp sword must always stand behind propaganda if it is to be really effective&quot;. The urge to proselytize comes not from a deeply held belief in the truth of doctrine but from an urge of the fanatic to &quot;strengthen his own faith by converting others&quot;.

Successful mass movements need not believe in a god, but they must believe in a devil. Hatred unifies the true believers, and &quot;the ideal devil is a foreigner&quot; attributed with nearly supernatural powers of evil. For example, Hitler described Jews as foreign interlopers and moreover an ephemeral Jewishness, alleged to taint the German soul, was as vehemently condemned as were flesh-and-blood Jews. The hatred of a true believer is actually a disguised self-loathing, as with the condemnation of capitalism by socialists while Russia under the Bolsheviks saw more intensive monopolization of the economy than any other nation in history. Without a devil to hate, mass movements often falter (for example, Chiang Kai-shek effectively led millions of Chinese during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s and the 1940s but quickly fell out of favor once the Japanese were defeated).

Fanaticism is encouraged in mass movements. Hoffer argues that &quot;the fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure&quot; and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to his life.

===Part 4. Beginning and End===
Hoffer identifies three main personality types as the leaders of mass movements, &quot;men of words&quot;, &quot;fanatics&quot;, and &quot;practical men of action&quot;. No person falls exclusively into one category, and their predominant quality may shift over time.

Mass movements begin with &quot;men of words&quot; or &quot;fault-finding intellectuals&quot; such as clergy, journalists, academics, and students who condemn the established social order (such as Trotsky, Mohammed, and Lenin). The men of words feel unjustly excluded from or mocked and oppressed by the existing powers in society, and they relentlessly criticize or denigrate present institutions. Invariably speaking out in the name of disadvantaged commoners, the man of words is actually motivated by a deep personal grievance. The man of words relentlessly attempts to &quot;discredit the prevailing creeds&quot; and creates a &quot;hunger for faith&quot; which is then fed by &quot;doctrines and slogans of the new faith&quot;. A cadre of devotees gradually develops around the man of words, leading to the next stage in a mass movement.

Eventually, the fanatic takes over leadership of the mass movement from the man of words. While the &quot;creative man of words&quot; finds satisfaction in his literature, philosophy or art, the &quot;noncreative man of words&quot; feels unrecognized or stifled and thus veers into an extremism against the social order. Though the man of words and the fanatic share a discontent with the world, the fanatic is distinguished by his viciousness and urge to destroy. The fanatic feels fulfilled only in a perpetual struggle for power and change. Examples include Jean-Paul Marat, Maximilien de Robespierre, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler.

The book also explores the behavior of mass movements once they become established as social institutions (or leave the &quot;active phase&quot;). With their collapse of a communal framework, people can no longer defeat their abiding feelings of insecurity and uncertainty by belonging to a compact whole. If the isolated individual lacks opportunities for personal advancement, development of talents, and action (such as those found on a frontier), he will seek substitutes. The substitutes would be pride instead of self-confidence, memberships in a collective whole like a mass movement, absolute certainty instead of understanding. The &quot;practical men of action&quot; take over leadership from the fanatics, marking the end of the &quot;dynamic phase&quot; and steering the mass movement away from the fanatic&#x27;s self-destructiveness. &quot;Hitler, who had a clear vision of the whole course of a movement even while he was nursing his infant National Socialism, warned that a movement retains its vigor only so long as it can offer nothing in the present... The movement at this stage still concerns itself with the frustrated—not to harness their discontent in a deadly struggle with the present, but to reconcile them with it; to make them patient and meek.&quot;

The focus shifts from immediate demands for revolution to establishing the mass movement as a social institution where the ambitious can find influence and fame. Leadership uses an eclectic bricolage of ideological scraps to reinforce the doctrine, borrowing from whatever source is successful in holding the attention of true believers. For example, proto-Christians were fanatics, predicting the end of the world, condemning idolatry, demanding celibacy and sowing discontent between family members, yet from those roots grew Roman Catholicism, which mimicked the elaborate bureaucratic structure of the Roman Empire, canonized early Christians as saints, and borrowed pagan holidays and rites. In the absence of a practical man of action, the mass movement often withers and dies with the fanatic (Nazism died as a viable mass movement with Hitler&#x27;s death).

Mass movements that succeed in causing radical change often exceed in brutality the former regime that the mass movement opposed. The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Jacobins in France ostensibly formed in reaction to the oppression of their respective monarchies but proved themselves far more vicious and brutal in oppressing their opponents.

Hoffer does not take an exclusively negative view of &quot;true believers&quot; and the mass movements they begin. He gives examples of how the same forces that give rise to true believer mass movements can be channelled in more positive ways:
Hoffer argues that the length of the &quot;active phase&quot; of a mass movement, the most energetic phase when fanatics are in control, can be predicted with some accuracy. Mass movements with a specific goal tend to be shorter-lived and feature less terror and bloodshed (such as the American Revolution). In contrast, an amorphous goal tends to result in a longer active phase of decades rather than months or years and also include substantially more bloodshed (such as the Bolsheviks in Russia, National Socialism in Germany).

In either case, Hoffer suggests that mass movements are accompanied by a dearth of creative innovation because so much energy is devoted to the mass movement. For example, in England, John Milton began a draft of his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in the 1640s before turning his literary talents to pamphleteering for the Commonwealth of England, only to finish the poem and his other major works after a change in government in 1660.

==Reception==
U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower read &quot;The True Believer&quot; in 1952, gave copies to friends, and recommended it to others. In 1956, &quot;Look&quot; ran an article calling Hoffer &quot;Ike&#x27;s Favorite Author&quot;. British Socialist Bertrand Russell called the book &quot;as sound intellectually as it is timely politically.&quot;

Frank Meyer in National Review criticized Hoffer for his “cheap cynicism” and “indiscriminate sniping at all belief, all strongly held principle, all moral doctrine” and likewise called Eisenhower’s endorsement “a very curious circumstance… one of sad significance”.

Ted Kaczynski mentioned &quot;The True Believer&quot; in paragraphs 222 and 230 of Industrial Society and Its Future when describing leftists and giving his advice about recruiting anti-technology revolutionaries.

&quot;The True Believer&quot; earned renewed attention after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and this occurred again also after the Tea Party protests and the Occupy Wall Street protests around a decade later.

Hillary Clinton wrote in her 2017 book &quot;What Happened&quot;, a work discussing her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, cited &quot;The True Believer&quot; as a book that she recommended to her staff during the campaign.

<text>Binary is a techno-thriller novel written by Michael Crichton, his eleventh published novel, in 1972, the eighth and final time the pseudonym John Lange was featured. Crichton also directed &quot;Pursuit&quot;, a television film version. The story of both the book and the film revolve around a deadly nerve agent composed by combining two different chemicals. Hard Case Crime republished the novel under Crichton&#x27;s name in 2013.

== Plot summary ==
State Department agent John Graves is investigating far-left businessman John Wright who has been acting suspiciously – he has masterminded the theft of canisters of VZ nerve gas, a binary agent, and has enough of them to kill nearly a million people, but the Agency is unsure of his motives.

During his investigation, Graves establishes that Wright has acquired other purchases; plastic explosives, containers made of a flammable material, seemingly of plumbing and pressure related nature – and also rented a small 19th floor apartment in San Diego where the President of the United States is due to meet for the imminent Republican Party convention. Graves deduces that Wright intends to assassinate the President.

Graves&#x27; task is made harder by inter-departmental interference, a lack of support from his manager Phelps, and that Wright has stolen a copy of Graves&#x27; State Department psychological profile, and seems to be depending on Graves behaving according to his profile.

Wright predicts Graves&#x27; actions, and allows himself to be captured in order to distract him from continuing his investigation – only to escape later, again predicting Graves&#x27; behaviour during the interrogation. However, prior to the interrogation, Graves decided against roadblocks surrounding the apartment, but realised that this was playing true to his profile, and changed his mind – Wright is subsequently killed trying to break through the unexpected blockade.

Observing the apartment through binoculars the two canisters of the VZ nerve agent are seen, with plumbing attachments in order to mix and disperse the two components. Also observed is a remote timing detonator, and booby traps. Seeing that the remote detonator is attached to mains electricity, the police cut off the supply, only for a battery backup to take over, and a small gas release results in the death of two officers stationed outside the apartment. The apartment is engulfed in VZ gas and inaccessible.

Although there is no cure for VZ, Nordmann – a forensic scientist attached to the case – reasons that there are other chemicals that can stave off the effects of VZ, possibly long enough for Graves to enter the apartment, nullify the detonator and leave again. Graves takes the chemicals and enters the apartment. Once inside, he finds that the booby traps are a sham, and the only danger is from the VZ gas itself which he vents through a window – being on the 19th floor the gas dissipates harmlessly into the unoccupied street below. After he disconnects the pipes from the tanks, the timer activates and click open – but, being disconnected, no gas is created, and Graves leaves the apartment thinking that victory has been too easily achieved. To support this theory he discusses his psychological profile with Nordmann &amp; Phelps, stressing that his key psyche flaw is that he considers tasks complete when in reality they are often only partially finished.

Phelps is dismissive, but Nordmann supports Graves&#x27; theory, and he is partially vindicated when a booby trap disables the lifts, trapping everybody on the 19th floor – but the trap was timed to go off &quot;after&quot; the venting was complete. Graves takes this to mean that Wright knew he might disarm the tanks and had a backup plan. He recalls the flammable nature of the tanks, and the missing plastic explosive, reasoning that Wright had intended the tanks to explode after being emptied – thus destroying any lingering evidence. Panicking, he realises that this is Wright&#x27;s backup plan; if the still-full tanks explode in the same room, enough of the two agents would still combine to kill thousands. One tank is manhandled out of the open venting window and explodes as it falls to the street. The other tank explodes in the hallway of the apartment block. The two chemicals are harmless by themselves, and nobody is injured by either the liquid chemicals or the explosions.

In an aftermath, Graves observes that in order to prevent public panic the incident is hushed up, being only referred to as a chemical theft &quot;halted by intervention of the Defense Department, with some minor assistance by State Department personnel, particularly Mr. R. Phelps&quot; and that although official departmental changes are recommended to prevent any further thefts, nothing is actually mandated and no policy changes are made.

==Reception==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; said it had a &quot;dotty, old-hat plot made unexpectedly credible with new gadgetry and well-engineered surprises&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;the author maintains tension ably&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;Pursuit&quot; was a 1972 made-for-TV movie that screened on the ABC network based on the novel. It was a TV Movie of the Week and marked Crichton&#x27;s directorial debut.

<text>MusE is computer software, a sequencer for Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and audio, with recording and editing abilities. It was originally written by Werner Schweer and now is developed by the MusE development team. It is free software released under GPL-2.0-or-later.

MusE aims to be a complete multitrack virtual studio for Linux. As of 2020, it has no support under other platforms as it relies on Linux-only technologies, such as Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). It also supports the Linux Audio Session Handler (LASH).

For version 0.7, the music notation feature was removed from MusE; this code later became the cross-platform notation app MuseScore Studio. A scoring feature returned to MusE in version 2.0.

From version 2.2 MusE supports the LV2 audio plugin format and the formerly supported Linux Audio Developer&#x27;s Simple Plugin API (LADSPA), Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI), and Virtual Studio Technology (VST).

From version 4.0 a redesigned user interface has been added.

<text>Arrival is the fourth studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was originally released in Sweden on 11 October 1976 by Polar Records. It became one of ABBA&#x27;s most successful albums to date, producing three of their biggest hits: &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;. The track &quot;Fernando&quot;, which had been recently released as a single in March 1976, was included on the Australian and New Zealand versions of the album. &quot;Arrival&quot; was the best-selling album of 1977 in the United Kingdom and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In 2024, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background and production ==
By the time ABBA began working on their fourth album in August 1975, they had achieved a modest level of success around the world. It was with &quot;Arrival&quot; however, that they would achieve global superstardom. Recording sessions began in August 1975 and continued until September 1976 at Metronome and Glen studios in Stockholm, Sweden. 

The first song to enter the studio was a track called &quot;Boogaloo&quot; on 4 August. Taking inspiration from the current disco sound (and in particular George McCrae&#x27;s &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot;), the backing track was laid down. The group knew that they had something big on their hands, as member Agnetha Fältskog remarked: &quot;We knew immediately it was going to be massive&quot;. With re-written lyrics, the song became known as &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, and would go on to be ABBA&#x27;s biggest ever hit. Work on the song continued intermittently until December 1975 due to the group&#x27;s increasing commitments in the latter half of the year. This was a result of the sudden surge of popularity that they found in the United Kingdom and Australia. During this time they also recorded a song (in Swedish), &quot;Fernando&quot;, for member Anni-Frid Lyngstad&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Frida ensam&quot;. 

In March 1976, &quot;Fernando&quot; was re-written with English lyrics and released as an ABBA single, becoming the group&#x27;s biggest hit to date - hitting No.1 in many countries, including a 14-week stay at No.1 in Australia. It was featured as a brand new track on their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album which became the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling album of the year. (In the Australian release of &quot;Arrival&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot; was included between &quot;Why Did It Have to Be Me&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot;). The next song they began working on, in late March, was &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, which became another major hit worldwide. Member Benny Andersson has said that it is &quot;one of our five best recordings&quot;.

By the end of April two other songs had been laid down: &quot;That&#x27;s Me&quot; and &quot;Why Did It Have to Be Me&quot;. The latter track was reworked into &quot;Happy Hawaii&quot; before being reverted to its original title, with new lyrics and vocals by Björn Ulvaeus (&quot;Happy Hawaii&quot; would later be released as a B-side). Similarly, &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; was worked into &quot;Gypsy Girl&quot; and then reverted to its original title. The song was released as a single and became a major hit some months after the album&#x27;s release.

In June 1976, a TV special dedicated to the group (entitled &quot;ABBA-dabba-dooo!!&quot;) was filmed. Around the same time, what was to become the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;When I Kissed the Teacher&quot;, was recorded. By late July &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Dum Dum Diddle&quot; were recorded, considered by biographer Carl Magnus Palm as the &quot;complete antithesis&quot; of each other. Both Lyngstad and Ulvaeus have expressed dissatisfaction with &quot;Dum Dum Diddle&quot;. In Ulvaeus own words, &quot;I&#x27;d been working all night trying to come up with a decent lyric. And I thought, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;d better take in something to prove that I&#x27;ve been working.&#x27; I showed them this song, thinking they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh, no! We can&#x27;t do that!&#x27;&quot;. &quot;My Love My Life&quot; was recorded next. Originally a more upbeat song titled &quot;Monsieur Monsieur&quot;, it became a lush ballad with backing harmonies inspired by 10cc&#x27;s hit &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;.

The final track to be recorded was an instrumental piece entitled &quot;Ode to Dalecarlia&quot;. Mostly featuring Andersson on keyboards, the track was renamed to &quot;Arrival&quot; – a word that had already been decided as the title of their new album. By September 1976, work on the album was finished.

== Release ==
&quot;Arrival&quot; was released in October 1976. The album was first released on compact disc (CD) in 1984 and then re-issued in digitally remastered form a total of four times; first in 1997, then in 2001, 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, and again in 2006 (as a special Deluxe Edition).

On 7 October 2016, the album was reissued for its 40th anniversary as a multi format release that included: a 45 RPM half-speed mastered double vinyl edition of the album, done by Abbey Road Studios on 12&quot; black 180g vinyl; a seven-inch box set of the singles &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot;, pressed on colored vinyl; and 7&quot; picture discs of each of these four singles. The liner notes on the double LP release featured new liner notes by Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall, who also conducted a new interview with Michael B. Tretow.

=== Album cover ===
The album cover shots were taken of the group posing in and out of a Bell 47 helicopter at the Barkarby Airport, northwest of Stockholm. The now-renowned &quot;mirrored-B&quot; copyrighted ABBA logo, an ambigram designed by Rune Söderqvist in 1976, was also premiered on this album cover.

=== Deluxe edition ===
In 2006, &quot;Arrival&quot; was reissued as a deluxe edition CD/DVD set to celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The first disc consisted of the original album, expanded with five bonus tracks. The DVD, along with the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot; (comprising single and album sleeves from around the world), featured extra content from the &quot;Arrival&quot; era, including: the one-hour long 1976 &quot;ABBA-dabba-dooo!!&quot; special, made by producer Leonard Eek and reporter Per Falkman for SVT, in which the band perform twelve songs and where footage of Björn and Benny working in their Viggsö cottage is featured; a performance of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; from a West German &quot;Musikladen&quot; special titled &quot;The Best of ABBA&quot;; an April 1976 performance of &quot;Fernando&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; a feature of ABBA&#x27;s promotional visit to London, titled &quot;ABBA in London&quot; from &quot;Young Nation&quot; (Novemember 1976); footage of the &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; recording session from &quot;Mr. Trendsetter&quot;, a 1975 Swedish documentary; a December news report from SVT&#x27;s &quot;Rapport&quot; on ABBA&#x27;s 1976 success; a cartoon version of &quot;Happy Hawaii&quot; by Fremantle Media; and two &quot;Arrival&quot; television commercials. The set also contained a 28-page booklet with an essay on the making of the album.

This was the first release from the ABBA Deluxe Edition album series.

== Critical reception ==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, music critic Ken Tucker panned &quot;Arrival&quot; as &quot;Muzak mesmerizing in its modality&quot; and wrote, &quot;By reducing their already vapid lyrics to utter irrelevance, lead singers Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Fältskog are liberated to natter on in their shrill voices without regard to emotion or expression.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a &quot;C&quot;, indicating &quot;a record of clear professionalism or barely discernible inspiration, but not both.&quot;

In a review upon the album&#x27;s 2001 reissue by Universal Records, AllMusic editor Bruce Eder found the material &quot;brilliant&quot; and complimented the reissue&#x27;s &quot;upgraded sound,&quot; as well as &quot;those dramatic musical effects that this group played for maximum effect, which gave their music a raw power that their detractors usually overlooked; in the new edition, it&#x27;s impossible to ignore.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), music journalist Arion Berger recommended its Universal reissue to consumers.

The album became a major seller all over the world, becoming the top-selling album of 1977 in both the UK and West Germany for example. It had three of ABBA&#x27;s biggest hits; &quot;Dancing Queen,&quot; &quot;Money Money Money&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You,&quot; and in some territories a fourth with the inclusion of &quot;Fernando&quot; (which in most markets had featured on their earlier &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album). &quot;That&#x27;s Me&quot; was released as a single in Japan only. &quot;Arrival&quot; was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and re-entered the UK album charts at #94 for the week of August 3, 2018, for the first time since 1979.

<doc id="1124254" wikidata="Q6158912" url="?curid=1124254" title="Japanese opium policy in Taiwan (1895–1945)">
<text>Taiwan (also known as Formosa) is an island located off the coast of Fujian in mainland China. The Chinese and Taiwanese people have a long history together, with the first Han Chinese settlers arriving in Taiwan in the seventeenth century. The Japanese empire acquired Taiwan (also known as Formosa) following its cession from Qing dynasty China in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) at the conclusion of the First Sino-Japanese War. This period of Japanese rule of Taiwan lasted until the surrender of Japan. During this period the colonial government of Japan initiated major policies to reduce the consumption of opium and opium derived products with much regarded success from contemporary sources both from the Japanese Colonial government and international sources.

There is a long history of opium use in Taiwan dating back to the arrival of the Han Chinese settlers in the 18th Century. The opium habit in Taiwan grew as a result of the Opium Wars in China, which inevitably led to the forced legalisation of opium in 1890. Between 1890 and 1891 the amount of legal opium imported into Taiwan increased from sixty kilos to four hundred thousand kilo. In 1892 alone the opium trade made up half of Taiwan&#x27;s revenue sources, resulting in the widespread presence of opium throughout Taiwan.

== Opium ==

Opium is a highly addictive type of depressant drug which dates back to 3400BC. The opium poppy pods contain a milky substance called latex, which is made up of a number of chemicals such as morphine and codeine. The Latex from the pods is boiled and dried to become opium. Opium has been used throughout history recreationally and as medicine, with historians predicting that opium was likely introduced throughout East Asia in the sixth century A.D. along the Silk Road trade route. The First and Second Opium Wars of the 19th century between the British Empire and Qing Dynasty saw the continued spread of opium throughout East Asia. While opium presented the opportunity for a lucrative trading market to many countries, the devastating impact of the addictive substance caused havoc across East Asia as well as throughout the US and Europe.

== Japanese views on opium ==
The Meiji Japanese held a negative view of opium and regarded it as an uncivilized and lazy practice. These fears may have stemmed from their observation of its effects on the Chinese population as well as aggression from western powers to force its export.

These fears were exacerbated by American diplomats such as Townsend Harris that described opium as &quot;the one great enemy of China&quot; and that it &quot;injures like the most deadly poison&quot;. The Meiji government strictly prohibited importation, possession and usage of opium except for medicinal purposes until 1868. Opium smoking in Japan was a rare occurrence and the punishment of the practice strict.

At the time Taiwan was ceded to Japan, opium smoking was regarded as one of the &quot;Three vices&quot; along with foot binding and the queue hairstyle that should be abolished. The Prime Minister at the negotiation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Itō Hirobumi expressed that &quot;There have been people living in Taiwan long before the arrival of opium,” and that &quot;The Japanese government will definitely prohibit opium after occupying Taiwan&quot;. However, there were fears that the practice may spread to Japan from Taiwan and also concerns that punishing opium usage could lead to anti-Japanese sentiment from Taiwanese locals.

Itō Hirobumi also expressed the contemporary Japanese view that that widespread opium usage was factor in Qing China&#x27;s decline, stating &quot;Opium smokers are rather lazy, and therefore soldiers cannot be at their best&quot;.

== Annexation of Taiwan from China ==
In 1894 the Sino-Japanese War began over Japan&#x27;s invasion of Korea. The Qing Dynasty was underprepared for the war and was overwhelmed by the power and force of the Japanese fleet. China was left humiliated by their defeat and in 1895 signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki which conceded Taiwan to Japanese rule in perpetuity. Taiwan was officially named Formosa under Japanese rule. The Taiwanese rebelled against the promise of Japanese rule and on 25 May 1895 established the ‘Republic of Formosa’. On 29 May over 12,000 Japanese troops arrived in Taiwan and begun disbanding the Taiwanese movement for independence. The &#x27;Republic of Formosa was officially defeated in October 1895 and Japanese occupation of Taiwan commenced. The Japanese government viewed Taiwan as a resource for Japan&#x27;s industries and saw an opportunity for a colonial market of Japanese goods and services which could improve the Japanese economy. The Japanese government&#x27;s opium policies throughout 1895 to 1945 were highly controversial given Taiwan&#x27;s long history with opium smoking. As well as the innate political and economic motivations of the Japanese government in interfering with the practice. Taiwan&#x27;s long history with opium is strongly associated with Taiwan&#x27;s close relationship with China throughout history.

== Formosa ==

Formosa was a Japanese colony for over 50 years, from 1895 to the end of WWII in 1945. During the first three years of Japan&#x27;s colonial rule, the Japanese military governed the island. However, in 1898 Tōkyō began appointing Japanese Governors to oversee Taiwan. As Taiwan was Japan&#x27;s first colony, many resources were used to ensure the success of the colony Formosa. Japan had widespread success in establishing order throughout the colony by working to eradicate diseases as well as improve the colonies infrastructure and overall economy. Japanese rule modernised Taiwan following the ‘Meiji’ restoration processes. Their initial policies focused on growing the agricultural industry by working to improve production outputs and farming techniques. The Japanese also built highways and improved the existing infrastructure of railway tracks which aimed to increase access to isolated areas the island and stimulate the economy. Taiwan Initially had 50 km of railway track when the Japanese first took control of the colony and worked to develop upwards of 500 km of railway tracks. The Japanese also constructed schools, hospitals and other key infrastructure such as roads, productive farms and trade ports. The Japanese government intended to propel Taiwan into a modern economy, and as a result became of the most advanced countries in East Asia.

Formosa experienced a shift in cultural identity as a result of Japanese rule. Although Formosa was not technically assimilated with Japanese culture, the local Taiwanese populations were forced to speak Japanese instead of their native language resulting in the loss of local culture. The Japanese ruled the Taiwanese people strictly, dictating policies which represented Japanese interests. A key aspect of the policies which were created to benefit Japanese interests at the time, involved control of the opium trade and strict regulation of its presence throughout Taiwanese and Japanese society. Japan&#x27;s desire to &quot;civilise&quot; Formosa and the &quot;savages&quot; which occupied the land extended past infrastructure and education, and focussed largely on opium usage. The practise of smoking opium was seen as primitive and dangerous by the Japanese hick as a threat to their ideology and their perception in the global world.

== Taiwan Opium Edict of 1897 ==

In 1895 the short-lived &#x27;Republic of Formosa&#x27; resistance leaders created fake &#x27;Japanese issued propaganda&#x27; stating that opium would be banned in the hope it would drive supporters to their cause. In response, the Japanese government made it temporality legal to continue smoking opium for the local Taiwanese residents, while stating it was punishable by death to supply opium to any Japanese individual. After the Republic of Formosa was defeated, the Japanese government took great issue with the prevalence of opium through Taiwan, fearing it would spread to Japan if not monitored correctly.

On 21 January 1897 the Japanese government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict which established a new opium policy for Taiwan. The Edict outlined the Japanese government&#x27;s monopoly over the trade of opium and the restricted sale of the drug to &quot;proven addicts&quot; with the necessary licences. The process of &#x27;Licensed opium usage&#x27; took three years to complete and resulted in just under 200,000 licences . Japan&#x27;s opium policy was conducted under the administration and leadership of the East Asia Development Board (&quot;Kōain&quot;) in operation from December 1938 to November 1942. The policy meant Taiwanese nationals who already addicted to opium could continue to smoke under government regulation. However, by the 1920s there were as many unregistered opium users as registered opium users. The imbalance between the number of registered and unregistered opium smokers demonstrated that the policy was ineffective at keeping nonusers from taking up smoking. Opium dens were common place throughout Southeast Asia. They were establishments where opium was sold and smoked and were frequented by locals and foreigners who were looking to access opium.

== Opium trade as a revenue source and the eventual eradication of opium smoking ==

The &#x27;Opium Edict&#x27; is viewed by some historians as the initial demonstration by the Japanese government of their intentions to profit from the opium trade. The government was in the process of making the opium trade a monopoly for their individual gain, whilst simultaneously developing policies which permitted users to continue smoking and prohibited people from starting to smoke. In 1896, 1 year after the Japanese began establishing a monopoly, opium revenue made up 60% of Taiwan&#x27;s total yearly revenue, which continued to grow throughout the 1900s, until opium smoking was effectively eradicated by the end of the Japanese era. The monopoly initially led to an increase in revenue achieved by inflated prices of opium and an overall decrease of smokers. The outcome of the Opium Edict suggests that the Opium policy had a twofold function, in that, revenue was needed to fund Japan&#x27;s occupation of Formosa and that controlling opium usage in Taiwan was a direct method of controlling the population. 

Nevertheless, the Japanese colonial government implemented a program of opium eradication. In 1930 it established the Government Center Hospital for Opium Addicts. Professor Tsungming Tu, the first Taiwanese to earn a medical doctorate, was appointed as its head. He devised a method for testing the presence of opium in patients&#x27; urine and a treatment method based on the substitution of opium with decreasing dosage of morphine. By the time Taiwan reverted to Chinese control in 1945, the number of opium smokers in Taiwan had become negligible. The eradication of opium smoking was seen as one of the most significant medical accomplishments during the Japanese colonial era.

<text>Hrvatski Telekom, also known as HT or Telekom, is a Croatian telecommunications company founded in 1998. Headquartered in Zagreb, it is majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom with a 53.5% stake and is publicly traded on the Zagreb Stock Exchange.

== History ==

The company was founded on 28 December 1998 after the separation of the &quot;Croatian Post and Telecommunications&quot; into two entities: Hrvatska pošta (Croatian Post) and Hrvatski Telekom (Croatian Telecom), which started their business operations on 1 January 1999.

Government of Croatia initiated the privatization of the state-owned telecommunications company, Hrvatski Telekom, in 1998. By October 1999, Deutsche Telekom, a German company, purchased a 35% stake in Hrvatski Telekom for $850 million and acquired an additional 16% stake in 2001, becoming the majority shareholder with 51%. 

In 2001, Hrvatski Telekom acquired Cronet, which was the second mobile operator in Croatia and the first to offer GSM network services in the country in 1996. Hrvatski Telekom established HT-mobilne komunikacije d.o.o. in 2002 as a separate entity dedicated to mobile services. 

The company rebranded as T-HT on October 1, 2004, becoming part of the global T-family of Deutsche Telekom. This included new trademarks for two business units: T-Com for fixed network operations and T-Mobile for mobile operations.

The Croatian government transferred 7% of its shares in HT to the Fund for Croatian Homeland War Veterans and Their Families on February 17, 2005. Later that year, on October 14, 2005, Hrvatski Telekom acquired a 39.1% stake in JP HT d.d. Mostar, known as HT Eronet, from the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the national telecom company&#x27;s privatization process.

In May 2006, HT acquired Iskon Internet, a major telecom provider in Croatia. By October 5, 2007, the Croatian government sold 32.5% of HT&#x27;s shares through an IPO, reducing its stake to 3.5% by June 2008, with private and institutional investors then holding 38.5%.

Hrvatski Telekom absorbed its subsidiary, T-Mobile, on January 1, 2010, creating a single unified company. The T-Com and T-Mobile brands were discontinued, although they remained active for business customers until 2013. HT acquired the IT services company Combis on May 17, 2010.

The Croatian government transferred 3.5% of its shares to the Pensioners’ Fund in December 2010, which transferred them to the Restructuring and Sale Center (CERP) in December 2013. CERP reduced its holding to 2.9% in December 2015.

In June 2014, HT acquired OT-Optima Telekom and subsequently held 19.1% of Optima&#x27;s share capital. The Croatian competition agency extended HT&#x27;s management of Optima until 2021.

HT acquired a 76.53% stake in Crnogorski Telekom, the largest telecommunications company in Montenegro, from Magyar Telekom for €123.5 million in January 2017. Magyar Telekom, like HT, has Deutsche Telekom as a majority stakeholder.

Hrvatski Telekom transferred its interests and shares in various subsidiaries, including Iskon Internet and OT-Optima Telekom, to HT holding on March 1, 2018. HT sold its electricity business to RWE Hrvatska in September 2018 and acquired digital terrestrial television provider HP Produkcija in November 2018, renaming it HT Produkcija in April 2019. HT sold its share in the travel agency E-tours to Uniline in November 2019. 

In January 2020, HT started selling its shares in Optima. By July 2021, HT and Zagrebačka banka agreed to sell their 54.31% stake in Optima to Telemach Hrvatska, finalizing the transfer in January 2022.

HT merged Kabelsko distributivni sustav (KDS) into HT, completed in December 2021. HT Produkcija was merged into HT in June 2022. HT holding transferred its shares in Iskon Internet to HT in June 2023, and the merger of Iskon into HT was completed in January 2024. The network unit from Ericsson Nikola Tesla Servisi joined HT Servisi, a subsidiary of HT, on January 1, 2024.

HT offers fixed telephony, broadband internet, and mobile telephony services. The company also provides television services under the MaxTV (IPTV and satellite) and EvoTV (pay digital terrestrial television) brands, as well as internet, television, and mobile services under the Iskon brand.

Additionally, HT offers to companies IT services through its subsidiary, Combis.

Otis Blackwell wrote the song at the offices of Shalimar Music in 1956 after Al Stanton, one of Shalimar&#x27;s owners, shaking a bottle of Pepsi at the time, suggested he write a song based on the phrase &quot;all shook up&quot;. According to Peter Guralnick, the song has a different origin. In his book &quot;Last Train to Memphis&quot;, he wrote that Elvis Presley thought &quot;All Shook Up&quot; was a good phrase for a refrain. For this he received a co-writing credit. Presley himself, during an interview on October 28, 1957, said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never even had an idea for a song. Just once, maybe. I went to bed one night, had quite a dream, and woke up all shook up. I phoned a pal and told him about it. By morning, he had a new song, &#x27;All Shook Up&#x27;.&quot;

Future &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; actor David Hess, using the stage name David Hill, was the first to record the song on Aladdin Records, titled &quot;I&#x27;m All Shook Up&quot;. In a 2009 interview, Hess revealed the origins of the song, and claimed to come up with the title of the song: &quot;As far as &#x27;All Shook Up&#x27;, the title came from a real set of circumstances and when I decided not to write it, Otis Blackwell did and I had the first recording for Aladdin Records. It was my title, but Otis wrote the song and Presley took a writing credit in order to get him to record it. That&#x27;s the way things happened in those days.&quot;

Vicki Young recorded a different song with the same title, &quot;(I&#x27;m) All Shook Up&quot;, on Capitol Records with Big Dave and His Orchestra, written by Bill Bellman and Hal Blaine in 1956. On January 12, 1957, Presley recorded the song at Radio Recorders in Hollywood. The duet vocal on the record is by The Jordanaires first tenor Gordon Stoker. Take 10 was selected for release, and in March the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart at #25. Within three weeks it had knocked Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Round and Round&quot; off the top spot, and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. The song also became Presley&#x27;s first No. 1 hit on the UK Singles Chart, remaining there for seven weeks. Sales of the single exceeded two million, and the song was named &quot;Billboard&#x27;&quot;s Year End number one song for 1957.

== Beatles versions ==
According to biographer Mark Lewisohn in &quot;The Complete Beatles Chronicle&quot;, The Beatles (first as The Quarrymen) regularly performed the song, from 1957 through 1960 (possibly later) with Paul McCartney on lead vocal. There is no known recorded version from that time. However, Len Garry of The Quarrymen (in his book &quot;John, Paul &amp; Me&quot;) states that it was one of the songs the group played on July 6, 1957, the day John Lennon met Paul McCartney and that the song was recorded then (but was erased later). 

Author Doug Sulpy (in &quot;Drugs, Divorce and a Slipping Image&quot;) adds that on January 13, 1969, during the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, they did record a &quot;spirited&quot; version of it with McCartney and George Harrison sharing vocals. Lennon did not join in the recording, as he was sitting watching while having tea. That version of the song remains officially unreleased (due to it being in mono and McCartney and Harrison not remembering all the lyrics by that late date). In 1999, McCartney cut a hard-rocking version on the album &quot;Run Devil Run&quot;, while his surviving Quarrymen bandmates recorded it in 2004 on &quot;Songs We Remember&quot;.

==Billy Joel version==
In 1991, Billy Joel recorded the song for the movie &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, which also featured other Elvis Presley songs by various artists. It was released as a single and peaked at No. 92 in the US and No. 27 in the UK.

==Other recordings and notable performances==
* Suzi Quatro recorded the song for her debut solo album &quot;Suzi Quatro&quot; in 1973 (titled &quot;Can the Can&quot; in Australia). Her recording of the song was released as a single in 1974 and peaked at number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Presley invited Quatro to Graceland, commenting that her version was the best since the original. Quatro declined the offer.
* A version by English DJ and producer Adamski titled &quot;The Space Jungle&quot; was released in 1990 on the album &quot;Doctor Adamski&#x27;s Musical Pharmacy&quot; and was a hit across Europe, peaking in the top 10 of the Finnish and UK charts, as well as on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart at No. 8.

<doc id="1124279" wikidata="Q628972" url="?curid=1124279" title="Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm">
<text>&quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; is a song by Canadian rock band Crash Test Dummies, and written by its singer Brad Roberts. It was released in October 1993 by Arista and BMG as the band&#x27;s lead single from their second album, &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; (1993). The accompanying music video was directed by Dale Heslip.

The song received positive critical reviews upon its release, though retrospective reviews have been more negative. &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the national charts of Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden—yet in the band&#x27;s native Canada, it stalled at number 14 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart. 

In 1994, &quot;Weird&quot; Al Yankovic released a parody of &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; called &quot;Headline News&quot;, with lyrics that humorously reference topical news items from the period. Brad Roberts enjoyed the parody version, and Crash Test Dummies performed the song with Yankovic on multiple occasions.

==Content==
Each of the three verses describes the isolation and suffering of a different child, two of whom have a physical abnormality. In the first verse, a boy is injured in a car accident and misses school for an extended period; when he returns to class, his hair has changed color from black to bright white. In the second verse, a girl refuses to change clothes in the presence of other girls due to the birthmarks that cover her body. The third child is a boy whose parents require that he come directly home after school; during services at their church, they &quot;shake and lurch&quot; across the floor. During a 2010 live performance for the Dutch radio station Kink FM, Roberts whispered &quot;Pentecostal&quot; during the third verse, suggesting this is the denomination of the church.

Most of the lyrics are based on childhood experiences of Roberts. For example, he was in a few serious car crashes as a child, which inspired the first verse; he has a birthmark at the base of his spine which made him a bullying target as a child, inspiring the second verse; and he knew a girl who went to a Pentecostal church, where members were known to speak in tongues, inspiring the third. He got the idea of a boy&#x27;s hair turning from black into bright white from stories he had heard about this phenomenon—Canities subita—happening to survivors of perilous experiences, including a man who almost went over the Niagara Falls, and his great uncle who fought in Pacific Theatre of World War II and heard Japanese soldiers yelling threats in broken English.

An alternative version sometimes performed at live concerts replaced the third verse with one concerning a boy whose mother disposed of his tonsils after a tonsillectomy, thus depriving him of the possibility of bringing them to show and tell.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; called the song a &quot;shimmering acoustic/rock jewel&quot;. He added that it &quot;marries a worldwise vocal with a textured arrangement that is chock full of aural goodies. Given justice (and promotional tender loving care), this one will soon blossom into the across-the-board smash it should be.&quot; Dave Sholin from the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; stated, &quot;If there&#x27;s an Alternative outlet in town, you can hear how great this sounds on the air.&quot; Robert Hilburn from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The exaggerated vocal narration makes this sound like a novelty, but it is a deceptively original work about how kids are often tormented for falling outside the norm.&quot; In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton joked, &quot;The unusual song probably holds the record for the longest song title not to include a vowel in the title.&quot; Caitlin Moran from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s delicate, like hope, and half-broken, like Nick Cave. It heaves and sighs with a choir to die for and a guitar line that snags on the heart.&quot; 

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; commented, &quot;It takes one weirdo to dig another, so Dummy Brad Roberts and &quot;Talking Head&quot; Harrison make an ideal pair. This ballad is deceivingly ACE until you listen to the lyrics.&quot; Terry Staunton from &quot;NME&quot; declared the song as &quot;a real oddity, a melodic saunter through the weird Americana of John Irving or Garrison Keillor&quot;. He added, &quot;Canada&#x27;s Crash Test Dummies present an ode to life&#x27;s misfits, borrowing a musical trick or two from the quieter side of REM and the more melancholy Tom Waits. [...] This is very good indeed.&quot; Alex Kadis from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; praised it as &quot;a truly beautiful masterpiece&quot;. Another &quot;Smash Hits&quot; editor, Mark Frith, gave it one out of five. Troy J. Augusto from &quot;Variety&quot; declared it as &quot;an unlikely yet quite hummable pop tune.&quot; The track received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, which it lost to &quot;I Swear&quot; by All-4-One.

===Retrospective reception===
Although highly successful when it was released, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; has since been frequently included on lists of bad songs. The song was number 15 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever&quot;, named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the &quot;15th Most Annoying Song&quot;, and ranked at number 31 on &quot;Blender&#x27;s&quot; list of the &quot;50 Worst Songs Ever&quot;. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; Canada ranked this song at number 29 on its list of &quot;50 Worst Canadian Songs Ever&quot;. Contrasting, VH1 named &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; as the 31st greatest one-hit wonder of the 1990s in 2011.

In a 1994 essay in which he makes the case that modern life is better than life in the past, humorist P.J. O&#x27;Rourke writes, &quot;Even the bad things are better than they used to be. Bad music, for instance, has gotten much briefer. Wagner&#x27;s Ring Cycle takes four days to perform while &#x27;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&#x27; by the Crash Test Dummies lasts little more than three minutes.&quot;

==Chart performance==
Outside their home country of Canada, the single became the band&#x27;s most successful song, reaching number four in the United States and number two in the United Kingdom—the group&#x27;s biggest hit in both countries. It also reached number one on the Modern Rock Chart in the United States and in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. While the Crash Test Dummies had six singles reach the Canadian top 10, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was not one of them, instead stalling at number 14.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was directed by Dale Heslip and premiered in October 1993. It sets the song&#x27;s lyrics as the script for a series of one-act plays performed by schoolchildren. Throughout, the scenes of the performance are intercut with scenes of the Crash Test Dummies performing the song at stage side.

All three one-act plays included nicknames for their lead characters, to provide Heslip with easy references:
# The first featured a kid nicknamed &quot;Whitey&quot;
# The second pitted &quot;Blotchy&quot; against &quot;Bratty Kids&quot;, who Heslip thought lived up to their nickname; Blotchy&#x27;s marks are covered with a long cape she wears throughout, whereas the &quot;Bratty Kids&quot; wear deerstalker hats and carry magnifying glasses
# The third had, as its focus, a &quot;Reluctant Boy&quot;

These nicknames were all revealed in an installment of &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot;. The same installment also revealed that Brad Roberts had decided to hum, rather than actually sing, the refrain of &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; because humming the refrain sounded more resigned to him and that he never wrote lyrics for it.

The music video for &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was later made available by Vevo on YouTube in 2018, and had amassed over 40 million views as of January 2024.

<doc id="1124281" wikidata="Q475031" url="?curid=1124281" title="Brown Eyed Girl">
<text>&quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; is a song by Northern Irish singer and songwriter Van Morrison. Written by Morrison and recorded in March 1967, it was released as a single in June of the same year on the Bang label, peaking at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song spent a total of sixteen weeks on the chart. It featured the Sweet Inspirations singing back-up vocals and is considered to be Van Morrison&#x27;s signature song.

==Recording and title==
After finishing his contract with Decca Records and the mid-1966 break-up of his band, Them, Morrison returned to Belfast seeking a new recording company. When he received a phone call from Bert Berns, owner of Bang Records, who had produced a number of recordings with Them, he flew to New York City and hastily signed a contract (which biographer Clinton Heylin says probably still gives him sleepless nights). During a two-day recording session starting 28 March 1967, he recorded eight songs intended to be used as four singles. The recording session took place at A &amp; R Studios and &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was captured on the 22nd take on the first day. Of the musicians Berns had assembled, there were three guitarists – Eric Gale, Hugh McCracken, and Al Gorgoni – plus bassist Russ Savakus and organist Garry Sherman, as well as Gary Chester on drums. It was released as a single in mid-June 1967.

Originally titled &quot;Brown-Skinned Girl&quot;, Morrison changed it to &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; when he recorded it. Morrison remarked on the title change: &quot;That was just a mistake. It was a kind of Jamaican song. Calypso. It just slipped my mind [that] I changed the title.&quot; &quot;After we&#x27;d recorded it, I looked at the tape box and didn&#x27;t even notice that I&#x27;d changed the title. I looked at the box where I&#x27;d lain it down with my guitar and it said &#x27;Brown Eyed Girl&#x27; on the tape box. It&#x27;s just one of those things that happen.&quot;

==Composition==

The song&#x27;s nostalgic lyrics about a former love were considered too suggestive at the time to be played on many radio stations. A radio-edit of the song was released which removed the lyrics &quot;making love in the green grass&quot;, replacing them with &quot;laughin&#x27; and a-runnin&#x27;, hey hey&quot; from a previous verse. This edited version appears on some copies of the compilation album &quot;The Best of Van Morrison&quot;. However, the remastered album seems to have the bowdlerised lyrics in the packaging but the original &quot;racy&quot; lyrics on the disc. Lyrically, it &quot;shows early hints of the idealized pastoral landscapes that would flow through his songs through the decades, a tendency that links him to the Romantic poets, whom Morrison has cited as an influence&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Because of a contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states that he has never received any royalties for writing or recording this song. The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid. Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song &quot;The Big Royalty Check&quot;. Morrison has stated that &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; is not among his favourite songs, remarking &quot;it&#x27;s not one of my best. I mean I&#x27;ve got about 300 songs that I think are better&quot;.

To capitalise on the success of the single, producer Berns assembled the album &quot;Blowin&#x27; Your Mind!&quot; without Morrison&#x27;s input or knowledge. Released in September 1967, the album contained the single as its lead-off track as well as songs recorded by Morrison at the March recording sessions for Berns. The album peaked at No. 182 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Legacy==
Morrison&#x27;s original recording of &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; has remained widely familiar, as the uncensored version of the song is regularly played by many &quot;oldies&quot; and &quot;classic rock&quot; radio stations. In 2011, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was honoured for having 10 million US radio air plays; it was one of only ten songs registered with BMI to have received that number of radio plays. As of 2015, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; remains the most downloaded and most played song of the entire 1960s decade. As of 2020, the song remains one of the longest-surviving songs from the 1960s in recurrent rotation in an era when the music of that decade has become increasingly rare as oldies stations have transitioned to 1970s and 1980s classic hits.

Paul Williams included &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; in his book &quot;Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles&quot;, writing that:

I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it&#x27;s also—very much and very wonderfully—a song about singing.

This song proved to be the impetus for Morrison&#x27;s career. It was his first single after leaving his position as lead singer for the Belfast-formed Them and led to his relocation to the United States and an eventual contract with Warner Bros. Records.

==Critical acclaim and influence==
In a contemporaneous review, &quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as an &quot;exciting debut&quot; and a &quot;groovy piece of original rock material that should fast establish [Morrison] as a top disk seller and writer&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;scores of deejays and consumers should dig this hard, thumping lid.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that Morrison &quot;socks across &#x27;Brown Eyed Girl&#x27; with plenty of beat.&quot;

In his 1989 book &quot;The Heart of Rock and Soul, The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever&quot;, Dave Marsh rated &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; No. 386. In 1999, Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) listed it as one of the Top 100 Songs of the Century. In 2000, it was listed at No. 21 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;/MTV list of 100 Greatest Pop Songs and as No. 49 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Rock Songs. In 2001, it was ranked No. 131 as one of the RIAAs Songs of the Century, a list of the top 365 songs of the 20th century chosen with historical significance in mind.

In 2010, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was ranked No. 110 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was listed as No. 79 on the All Time 885 Greatest Songs compiled by WXPN from listeners&#x27; votes. In January 2007, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It is also one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

==El Chicano version==

El Chicano remade &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; for their 1972 album &quot;Celebration&quot;. Kapp Records had invited music journalist Don Buday to produce the album, being impressed by Buday&#x27;s writings on El Chicano: Buday had the group remake &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; and also the Cream hit &quot;I Feel Free&quot; &quot;[to try] to give [El Chicano] more of a rock-and-roll identity&quot;. Journeyman recording engineer Val Garay, who had his first engineering assignment producing &quot;Celebration&quot;, would recall that &quot;Don got this brilliant idea of [remaking] &#x27;Brown Eyed Girl&#x27;...kind of like the &#x27;Mexican Everly Brothers&#x27;.&quot; Released as the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; peaked at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Chicanismo scholar Dionne Espinoza opined that the El Chicano version of &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; turned the song into &quot;an affirmation of the beauty of brown[-skinned] women&quot;.

<doc id="1124287" wikidata="Q991121" url="?curid=1124287" title="Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)">
<text>&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; is a song recorded by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. Written primarily by Mick Jagger, it is the opening track and lead single from their ninth studio album, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971). It became a number one hit in both the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it charted at number two. In the United States, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the number 16 song for 1971.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 495 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010 and number 490 in 2004 and at number five on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.

==Inspiration and recording==
Though credited to Jagger–Richards, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the filming of &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; in 1969. According to Marsha Hunt, Jagger&#x27;s girlfriend and the mother of his first child Karis, he wrote the song with her in mind. Former Ikette Claudia Lennear disputes this claim, saying that it was written about her. In 2014, Lennear told &quot;The Times&quot; that she is the subject of the song because she was dating Jagger when it was written. Bill Wyman stated in his book &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot; (2002) that the lyrics were partially inspired by Lennear.

&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was recorded over a three-day period at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama, from 2 to 4 December 1969. The song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band&#x27;s former label. At the request of guitarist Mick Taylor (who had joined the band as Brian Jones&#x27; replacement in July 1969), the Stones debuted the number live during the infamous concert at the Altamont Speedway on 6 December 1969.

In the liner notes to the compilation album &quot;Jump Back&quot; (1993), Jagger says, &quot;The lyric was all to do with the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very instant thing, a definite high point&quot;.

In a December 1995 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Jagger spoke at length about the song, its inspiration, and its success, and credited himself with its lyrics. Keith Richards also credits Jagger with the song in his autobiography. Jagger attributed the success of the song to a &quot;good groove&quot;. After noting that the lyrics could mean so many lewd subjects, he again noted that the combination of those subjects, the lyrical ambiguity was partially why the song was considered successful. He noted, &quot;That makes it... the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I&#x27;m on about on that song. It&#x27;s such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go... I never would write that song now.&quot; When interviewer Jann Wenner asked him why, Jagger replied, &quot;I would probably censor myself. I&#x27;d think, &#x27;Oh God, I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got to stop. I can&#x27;t just write raw like that.

An alternative version was recorded on 18 December 1970 at Olympic Studios in London during a birthday party for Richards and Bobby Keys. It features appearances by Al Kooper on piano, and Eric Clapton on slide guitar. The alternative version, which had previously been available only on bootleg recordings, was released in June 2015 on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the reissued &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; album.

==Release==
&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was released in April 1971 as the first single from the album. While the US single featured only &quot;Bitch&quot; as the B-side, the British release also featured a live rendition of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, recorded at the University of Leeds during the 1971 tour of the United Kingdom.

The song is also the first single released on Rolling Stones Records (catalogue number RS-19100) and is one of two Rolling Stones songs (along with &quot;Wild Horses&quot;) licensed to both the band and former manager Allen Klein (a result of various business disagreements), resulting in its inclusion on the compilation album &quot;Hot Rocks 1964–1971&quot;. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; is also included on the most significant latter-day The Rolling Stones compilations, &quot;Jump Back&quot;, &quot;Forty Licks&quot;, and &quot;GRRR!&quot;.

To promote the song, the Rolling Stones performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with the performance taped sometime around late March 1971 and broadcast on 15 April and 6 May. They performed &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot; for the show&#x27;s segment dedicated to albums, which was shown on 22 April 1971; due to BBC practices at the time, the performances were erased and all that remains is &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Saxophone player Trevor Lawrence mimes to Bobby Keys&#x27; actual solo.

In the United Kingdom, the single was originally issued in mono using a now-rarely heard bespoke mono mix. This mono mix has not been released on any compilation.

The song was performed routinely during the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1970 European tour, occupying a prominent spot near the end of the set list even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. The band opened the shows of their infamous 1972 American tour with &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, and it has since become a Stones concert staple. However, Jagger has changed some of the more controversial lyrics when performing the song live. For example, the first verse line &quot;I hear him whip the women just around midnight&quot; has been replaced with &quot;you should have heard him just around midnight.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Writing for &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1971, Penny Valentine praised &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, stating that it was her &quot;choice as the best track&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described the song as returning to &quot;the fresh blues sound of the team&#x27;s pre-Satanic days&quot; with a &quot;sax break, gritty wailing and the unique stones rhythm work.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that it &quot;is firmly in [the Rolling Stones&#x27;] hallowed tradition of gritty, groovy music.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Rag&quot;, rock critic Mike Saunders found the single to be the &quot;only especially noteworthy&quot; track of &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971).

The lyrical subject matter has been a point of interest and controversy. Described by rock critic Robert Christgau as &quot;a rocker so compelling that it discourages exegesis&quot;, the song&#x27;s popularity has often overshadowed its provocative lyrics, which explore a number of controversial subjects, including slavery, interracial sex, cunnilingus, and drug use.

In 2021, the band announced that the song would be removed from the setlist of their US tour.

== Cover versions ==
Little Richard recorded a rendition of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; for his album &quot;The King of Rock and Roll&quot;, released in 1971.

<text>&quot;Kashmir&quot; is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. Featured on their sixth studio album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; (1975), it was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant with contributions from John Bonham over a period of three years with lyrics dating to 1973. John Paul Jones was late arriving to the studio for the recording sessions, so did not receive a writer&#x27;s credit.

The song became a concert staple, performed by the band at almost every concert after its release. It has been described as one of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s two most overtly progressive epics (the other being &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;).

==Composition==
Page uses a guitar tuning of D–A–D–G–A–D, which he had used for the instrumentals &quot;White Summer&quot; and &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;. The song combines different rhythmic meters: the guitar riff is in triple meter, while the vocal is in quadruple meter. Plant felt that the drumming was an important component of the song and that Bonham did not overplay his part.

Page recorded a demo version with drummer Bonham late in 1973, when John Paul Jones was late for the recording sessions. Plant later added lyrics and a middle section; in early 1974, Jones added orchestration. Session players were brought in for the string and horn sections and Jones added a Mellotron part.

The lyrics were written by Plant in 1973 immediately after Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1973 US tour. None of the group members had visited Kashmir. Instead, Plant was inspired during a drive through a desolate desert area of southern Morocco.

==Live performances==
&quot;Kashmir&quot; was played live at almost every Led Zeppelin concert after its debut in 1975. A version from Knebworth in 1979 appears on the &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; (2003). The surviving members performed the song at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988.

Page and Plant recorded a longer, live version, with an Egyptian/Moroccan orchestra for &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot; (1994) and performed the song with an orchestra on their 1995 tour.

Led Zeppelin, with John Bonham&#x27;s son Jason on drums, performed &quot;Kashmir&quot; at Led Zeppelin&#x27;s reunion show at The O2, London on 10 December 2007. That rendition – released on &quot;Celebration Day&quot; in 2012 – was nominated in 2014 for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Grammys. Kashmir&#x27; actually isn&#x27;t that difficult&quot;, Page remarked during rehearsals for the show. &quot;But it helps to have a drummer who understands the part and a bass player who can play bass with his feet. Sometimes it sounds like John&#x27;s got three feet. It&#x27;s intense.&quot;

==Reception==
All four members of Led Zeppelin have agreed that &quot;Kashmir&quot; is one of their best musical achievements. John Paul Jones suggested that it showcases all of the elements that made up the Led Zeppelin sound. Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis comments:
In a retrospective review of &quot;Physical Graffiti (Deluxe Edition)&quot;, Brice Ezell of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described &quot;Kashmir&quot; as &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;″s &quot;quintessential track&quot;. Ezell called &quot;Kashmir&quot;&#x27;s &quot;doomy ostinato riff and rapturous post-chorus brass/mellotron section&quot; as &quot;inimitable moments in the legacy of classic rock&quot;.

==Accolades==
The song is listed highly in a number of professional music rankings:

==Copyright issue==
The 1988 Schoolly D song &quot;Signifying Rapper&quot;, which samples &quot;Kashmir&quot;, was the target of lawsuits following its use in the 1992 film &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;. In 1994, Page and Plant successfully sued Home Box Office to have the song removed from televised showings of the film and Live Home Video and distributor Aries Film Releasing were ordered to destroy any unsold copies of &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; as part of a copyright infringement ruling.

<text>Matthew James Sutherland Dawson, MBE (born 31 October 1972) is an English retired rugby union player who played scrum half for Northampton Saints and then London Wasps. During his international career he toured with the British &amp; Irish Lions three times and was part of England&#x27;s 2003 Rugby World Cup winning side. He won 77 caps for his country in total, including nine as captain and was England&#x27;s most capped scrum half until passed by Danny Care.

Dawson was best known for his trademark &#x27;sniping runs&#x27; and played the whistle well, often scoring tries from &#x27;tap and go&#x27; penalties. When called upon, he could also demonstrate his versatility by kicking goals.

Since retiring, Dawson has become a team captain on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; besides appearing on various reality shows and is a commentator and presenter on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s rugby programme. Dawson currently works as a health ambassador for Sodexo, a global food and facilities provider. In early 2014, he was appointed as director for business development at the flexible workplace company, Instant.

==Rugby career==

===Club===
Dawson joined Northampton in 1991 after leaving school and was among the last generation of players to have started their careers during the amateur era. Before rugby union became openly professional in 1995 he worked as a security guard and coached at Spratton Hall School. He formed a successful half-back partnership with Paul Grayson, winning the 2000 Heineken Cup (though he missed the final through injury) and finishing runner-up in the Anglo-Welsh Cup three times. In the club&#x27;s 130th anniversary poll he and Grayson were voted by fans into the all-time dream XV.

In 2004, Dawson moved from Northampton to London Wasps after his contract was not renewed and won the Premiership title in his first season.

On 7 April 2006, Dawson announced that he would be retiring from rugby completely at the end of the season and on 14 May 2006, he played his last game of Premiership rugby, when Sale denied Wasps their chance of winning the Premiership title four years in a row and so equalling Leicester&#x27;s record.

===International===
In 1993, Dawson was a member of the England Sevens team which won the inaugural Sevens World Cup in Scotland. Dawson and competition teammate Lawrence Dallaglio were the first players to win the World Cup at both the 15- and 7-a-side games. Ma&#x27;a Nonu &amp; Mils Muliaina have since repeated this feat.

Dawson made his international debut for England in December 1995, against Western Samoa, but would have to fight with Andy Gomarsall, Austin Healey but mostly Kyran Bracken for the England number 9 shirt.

Dawson went on the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa as third-choice scrum-half behind Healey and Rob Howley, but injury to Howley and some good performances saw Dawson make the starting line-up. In the first test with ten minutes to go, Dawson broke from the base of a scrum and threw an overhead dummy that checked the four Springboks allowing him to scamper in for the winning try. That victory was the start of a 2–1 series win, clinched when he fed Jeremy Guscott for the series-winning drop goal.

Dawson captained England for the first time when he was chosen as captain for the infamous 1998 &quot;tour from hell&quot; in the absence of more experienced internationals. Despite the disastrous results he would go on to establish himself in the starting XV. He became first-choice scrum half at the 1999 Rugby World Cup after Bracken&#x27;s withdrawal due to injury and scored England&#x27;s first try of the competition just eight minutes into the opening match, a 67–7 win, against Italy.

He was captain in the 2000 Six Nations and often in the absence of Martin Johnson.

In the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, Dawson went as second-choice scrum half behind Howley. Howley played in the first two tests but was injured for the third, where Dawson played. Controversially however, Dawson was one of the mid-week sides opposed to the training regime of coach Graham Henry and publicly criticised him, although this did not cause as much stir as Healey&#x27;s similar comments. He and Healey avoided being sent home but were fined by the disciplinary committee. Later in the week he redeemed himself by converting Healey&#x27;s try during extra time to win a closely tied match against the Brumbies.

Dawson&#x27;s career nearly ended after sustaining a neck injury during the record 53–3 win against South Africa in November 2002, when he was headbutted by Springbok skipper Corné Krige. He became an integral part of the England side, winning his 50th cap against Ireland on the same day England won the 2003 Six Nations Grand Slam. That same year he was a crucial part of the team that won the World Cup. He played a vital role in winning the final tie against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003. With less than a minute remaining in extra time he made a completely unexpected break gaining a vital 20 metres upfield. From the later ruck he fed the ball to Jonny Wilkinson for the winning drop goal.

In the autumn of 2004, he failed to turn up to an England training camp due to a previously arranged commitment to appear on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, resulting in him being dropped from the England squad for the 2004 Autumn internationals. A return to the 2005 Six Nations was expected and Dawson rejoined the Elite Player Squad for the tournament, playing well enough to earn a place on the 2005 British Lions tour to New Zealand, managed by Sir Clive Woodward.

Dawson returned to the England fold in 2005 but had limited opportunities in a disappointing Six Nations campaign as Harry Ellis started at number nine for four of the five matches.

==Media career==
In 2004 Dawson joined the long running BBC TV quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, featuring as a regular team captain opposite Ally McCoist and subsequently, Phil Tufnell.

In September 2006 he appeared in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; programme, beating Roger Black and Hardeep Singh Kohli, to win the final.

He took part in &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2006, partnered by Lilia Kopylova. Although appearing initially to be an unlikely contender, he came second, only beaten in the final by cricketer Mark Ramprakash. He later returned to the show in 2008 to dance with Elaine Paige in &quot;Sport Relief does Strictly Come Dancing&quot; to raise money for Sport Relief, where they came second.

In January 2007 it was announced that Dawson would be joining BBC Radio Five Live as summariser for the commentary on England&#x27;s forthcoming Six Nations Championship games. He went on to cover the 2007 Rugby World Cup for the BBC. He also presents 5-Live&#x27;s weekly Rugby show. He was recently on an edition of www.888.com TV poker special where he finished second.

In 2008 Dawson co-hosted &quot;Mitch and Matt&#x27;s Big Fish&quot;, a seafood lovers tour of the British coast, in which he and Mitch Tonks tasted and cooked a variety of fish dishes using the catch of the British fishing ports.

In 2010 Dawson hosted Monster Munchies for Good Food, where he challenged two teams to make a monster sized local delicacy in 24 hours, which were unveiled at a local show and were judged on size, presentation and taste. The size they were aiming for was that of a small car.

In 2023 Dawson was a contestant on &quot;Richard Osman&#x27;s House of Games&quot;, alongside Malorie Blackman, Chris McCausland and Ranvir Singh.

==Charitable work==
Dawson is the 2013 President of children&#x27;s medical research charity Sparks, whose mission is to ensure that all babies are born healthy and stay healthy. Matt attended their 2012 Winter Ball along with other supporters of the charity such as Lady Gabriella Windsor, who was in attendance in place of her mother, Sparks Royal Patron, Princess Michael of Kent. In 2015, he fronted a cycle ride for the charity from the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to Twickenham in London, 150 miles in one day.
He is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland. He posed nude in the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in support of the testicular and prostate cancer charity Everyman.

Dawson has been supporting the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) since 2004 and became a UNICEF UK ambassador in 2009. In June 2009, he took time out while broadcasting for the Lions tour in South Africa to visit UNICEF programmes focusing on education, shelter and HIV/AIDS.

He completed the 2007 London Marathon for charity, in 4 hours 35 minutes and 39 seconds.

*Patron of The National Hospital Development Foundation (NHDF)
*Patron of Beating Bowel Cancer – a leading UK charity for bowel cancer patients, working to raise awareness of symptoms, promote early diagnosis and encourage open access to treatment choice for those affected by bowel cancer.

==Personal life==
Born in Birkenhead, Dawson was raised in Buckinghamshire and attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe after passing the 12-plus (Buckinghamshire students at the time took the exam a year later). While in school he excelled in cricket and football before deciding to concentrate on rugby.

He was married to German-born former model, Carolin Hauskeller, and the couple have two sons. Dawson announced their separation via social media on 21 September 2020. Dawson is a supporter of Everton F.C.

Dawson published his autobiography, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, in 2004.

In 2016, Dawson revealed how his family went through &quot;two weeks of hell&quot; as his two-year-old son battled meningitis W135.

In 2017, Dawson joined forces with The Big Tick Project, which looks to raise awareness about the dangers of ticks and tick-borne disease in the UK after revealing he had contracted Lyme disease. He was bitten by a tick in a London Park early the previous year.

<text>&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; is a song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong for Motown Records in 1966. The first recording of the song to be released was produced by Whitfield for Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips and released as a single in September 1967. It went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles chart and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart and shortly became the biggest selling Motown single up to that time.

The Miracles were the first to record the song in 1966, but their version was not released until August 1968, when it was included on their album &quot;Special Occasion&quot;.

The Marvin Gaye version was the second to be recorded, in the beginning of 1967, but the third to be released. It was placed on his 1968 album &quot;In the Groove&quot;, a year and a half later, where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys. Motown founder Berry Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single on the Tamla subsidiary in October 1968, when it went to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969, overtaking the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips version as the biggest hit single on the Motown family of labels up to that point.

The Gaye recording has since become an acclaimed soul classic. In 1998 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. In 2004, it was placed 80th on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, then re-ranked at 81 in 2010. In 2021, it was ranked 119. And on the commemorative fortieth anniversary of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in June 2008, Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Grapevine&quot; was ranked sixty-fifth.

In 2018, the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips version was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In addition to being released several times by Motown artists, the song has been recorded by a range of musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival, who made an eleven-minute interpretation for their 1970 album, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot;.

==Composition==
The song is composed in E-flat minor. The lyrics tell the story in the first person of the singer&#x27;s feelings of betrayal and disbelief when he hears of his girlfriend&#x27;s infidelity only indirectly &quot;through the &#x27;grapevine&#x27;&quot;.

By 1966, Barrett Strong, the singer on Motown Records&#x27; breakthrough hit, &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, had the basics of a song he had started to write in Chicago, where the idea had come to him while walking down Michigan Avenue that people were always saying &quot;I heard it through the grapevine&quot;. The phrase is associated with black slaves during the Civil War, who had their form of telegraph: the human grapevine. Producer Norman Whitfield worked with Strong on the song, adding lyrics to Strong&#x27;s basic Ray Charles-influenced gospel tune and the single chorus line of &quot;I heard it through the grapevine&quot;. This was to be the first of a number of successful collaborations between Strong and Whitfield.

==Motown recordings==
Producer Norman Whitfield recorded &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; with various Motown artists.

===The Miracles===
The first known recording is with The Miracles on August 6, 1966, though there may also have been a recording with the Isley Brothers, or at least Whitfield intended to record it with them; however, a track has not turned up – some Motown historians believe that a session may have been scheduled but cancelled. The Miracles&#x27; version was not released as a single due to Berry Gordy&#x27;s veto during Motown&#x27;s weekly quality control meetings. Gordy advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single. The Miracles version later appeared on their 1968 &quot;Special Occasion&quot; album, and a slightly different take, possibly from the same session but unreleased, appeared on the 1998 compilation album, &quot;Motown Sings Motown Treasures&quot;.

===Marvin Gaye===
Marvin Gaye&#x27;s version, released on his 1968 album &quot;In the Groove&quot;, is the second known recording. Whitfield recorded the song with Gaye over five sessions, the first on February 3, 1967, and the last on April 10, 1967. Recordings of this version took more than a month due to Whitfield overdubbing Gaye&#x27;s vocals with that of the Andantes&#x27; background vocals, mixing in several tracks featuring the Funk Brothers on the rhythm track, and adding the string section from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with an arrangement by Paul Riser.

The session featuring Gaye led to an argument between the producer and singer. Whitfield wanted Gaye to perform the song in a higher key than his normal range, a move that had worked on David Ruffin during the recording of the Temptations&#x27; hit, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;. According to Gerald Posner, Whitfield was confident that he had a hit; however, despite approval from Motown&#x27;s Quality Control Department, Gordy blocked the release.

===Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips===
Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips recorded &quot;Grapevine&quot; on June 17, 1967, in Motown&#x27;s Studio A, also with Norman Whitfield as producer. After hearing Aretha Franklin&#x27;s version of &quot;Respect&quot;, Whitfield rearranged &quot;Grapevine&quot; to include some of the funk elements of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. According to David Ritz, Whitfield set to record a song that would &quot;out-funk&quot; Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, Gladys Knight, Bubba Knight, William Guest, and Edward Patten worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, the first line of the second verse (&quot;I know a man ain&#x27;t supposed to cry/But these tears I can&#x27;t hold inside&quot;) was altered to (&quot;Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can&#x27;t hold inside&quot;). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips&#x27; version to be a single on September 28, 1967, on Motown&#x27;s Soul label.

===Other Motown artists===
In 1968, Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers recorded a version for their debut album based on Knight&#x27;s recent hit. But after hearing the Marvin Gaye version, they felt they had made the wrong choice. In 1969, Whitfield produced a version for the Temptations &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; album, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, in which he &quot;brought compelling percussion to the fore, and relegated the piano well into the wings&quot;. In 1971, the Undisputed Truth recorded the song in a Gaye-styled version.

==Releases==
Since both the Miracles&#x27; and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s renditions of the song were rejected by Gordy as a single, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips&#x27; version became the first to be released, on September 28, 1967, on Motown&#x27;s Soul label, with &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Go Now&quot; on the B-side. Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played. The Pips&#x27; version of &quot;Grapevine&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart on November 25, 1967, and stayed there for six weeks, making it the group&#x27;s second R&amp;B number one after 1961&#x27;s &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart the same month, with the Monkees&#x27; &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; holding top spot. It was Motown&#x27;s best-selling single to that point, remaining in the top 10 of the Hot 100 for nearly two months. The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips album &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot;.

After this success Whitfield again wanted Gordy to release Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Grapevine&quot; as a single, but Gordy did not want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it. In August 1968, Whitfield added &quot;Grapevine&quot; to Gaye&#x27;s new album &quot;In the Groove&quot;. On release &quot;Grapevine&quot; became a radio hit and, according to Gordy himself, &quot;The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single&quot;. So Gaye&#x27;s version was released as a single on October 30, 1968. Gaye&#x27;s &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; eventually outsold the Pips&#x27;, and until The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; 20 months later, was the biggest hit single of all time on the Motown label. It stayed at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart for seven weeks, from December 14, 1968, to January 25, 1969. Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Grapevine&quot; also held number one on the R&amp;B chart during the same seven weeks, and stayed at number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks starting on March 26, 1969. The label was pleased with the success, although Gaye, depressed because of issues such as the illness of singing partner Tammi Terrell (which would kill her less than a year later), was quoted as saying that his success &quot;didn&#x27;t seem real&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t deserve it&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of it that &quot;tremendous percussion and a brilliant production job add even more luster to a terrific vocal.&quot;

Due to the song&#x27;s success, &quot;In the Groove&quot; was re-issued as &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and peaked at number two on the R&amp;B album chart and number sixty-three on the album chart, which was at the time Marvin&#x27;s highest-charted solo studio effort to date. Because of the success of both versions, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; was the first and last number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December. Gladys Knight was not pleased that Gaye&#x27;s version usurped her own, and claimed that Gaye&#x27;s version was recorded over an instrumental track Whitfield had prepared for a Pips song, an allegation Gaye denied. In 1985, one year following Gaye&#x27;s death, the song was re-released in the UK reaching number eight thanks to a Levi&#x27;s commercial (starring Nick Kamen).

==Legacy==
The Gaye recording has become an acclaimed soul classic. In 2004, it was placed at number 80 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, with the comment that Whitfield had produced the song with a number of artists using different arrangements, and that on the Marvin Gaye recording he had a &quot;golden idea&quot; when he set the song &quot;in a slower, more mysterious tempo&quot;. In a new &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list published in 2011, the single was placed slightly lower at number 81.

In 1998, the Marvin Gaye version of the song was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. In June 2008, on the commemorative fiftieth anniversary of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the Marvin Gaye version was ranked as the sixty-fifth biggest song on the chart. In 2018, the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips version was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Other versions==
In addition to being recorded several times by Motown artists, the song has been recorded by musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival, whose 11-minute version appeared on their 1970 album &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; The band had initially started to play the song live before rearranging it in the studio with a long jam-like instrumental part for their record. Unusually for such a long song, radio stations began to play the song, and eventually it was released as a single against the band&#x27;s wishes. The release reached 43 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s chart, with more modest success in other countries.

In addition, funk musician Roger Troutman whose extended version taken from his 1981 solo album, &quot;The Many Facets of Roger&quot;, brought the song back to number one on the R&amp;B chart in 1981, marking the third time the song reached the top spot on that chart. It also made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but was not a Pop success this time around, peaking at number 79.

British punk band the Slits recorded the song in a post-punk style as a bonus track on their 1979 album &quot;Cut&quot;.

In 1996, the Soultans released their version of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;. It reached number 24 in Austria, and charted in New Zealand, Germany and Belgium. Queen Latifah used the original version as a rhythmic basis for her 1998 single &quot;Paper&quot;, produced by Pras Michel for her album &quot;Order in the Court&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; has been used twice in television commercials – each time using session musicians recreating the style of the Marvin Gaye version. For the 1985 Levi&#x27;s 501 commercial &quot;Launderette&quot;, featuring male model Nick Kamen, agency BBH and director Roger Lyons, owing to budgetary constraints, brought in Karl Jenkins and Mike Ratledge to recreate the sound of the Marvin Gaye original with Tony Jackson, a Barbadian background singer for Paul Young, handling vocals and P. P. Arnold on backing vocals. The commercial&#x27;s success prompted Tamla-Motown to re-release Gaye&#x27;s single with the Levi&#x27;s 501 logo on the sleeve — &quot;an example of integrated marketing almost before the term was invented&quot;. The record went to number eight on the UK Singles chart, marking its second chart performance. A year later, in 1986, Buddy Miles was the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins which sang it as part of a TV advertising campaign.

Marvin Gaye&#x27;s version of the song is used in the opening credits of &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983) as each of the main characters gets to hear (through the &quot;grapevine&quot;) about the death of their college friend, and then travels to his funeral; the song serves in an extradiegetic fashion to both unite the main characters&#x27; friendship and to locate it nostalgically for the viewer.

== Grapevine (Tiësto) ==
&quot;Grapevine&quot; is a song by Dutch DJ and producer Tiësto. It was released on October 26, 2018 in the Netherlands on the Musical Freedom label. It marked Tiësto&#x27;s return to the Brazilian bass genre. Gaye&#x27;s song is extensively sampled in the track, which was premiered during Tiësto&#x27;s set at Ultra Music Festival 2018 in Miami. The music video was released on January 12, 2020.

Fabien Dori from French webmedia &quot;Guettapen&quot; criticized the &quot;cruel lack of originality&quot; of the track, stating that &quot;the drop seems strangely like the one from &#x27;Boom&#x27;, and this is not the generic vocal which will enhance the whole&quot;.

<doc id="1124295" wikidata="Q251764" url="?curid=1124295" title="Unit 100">
<text>was an Imperial Japanese Army facility called the Kwantung Army Warhorse Disease Prevention Shop that focused on the development of biological weapons during World War II. It was operated by the Kempeitai, the Japanese military police. Its headquarters was located in Mokotan, Manchukuo, a village just south of the city of Changchun. It had branches in Dairen and Hailar. The Hailar branch was later transferred to Foshan. Between 600 and 800 people worked at Unit 100. 

The Unit focused on plant and animal biological warfare, producing and deploying livestock and crop viruses in China. The Unit was led by Wakamatsu Yujiro. Unit 100 would cooperate with Unit 731 when necessary.

== Organization ==
Unit 100 had six sections.
# Bacteriological section
# Pathological section
# Animal Experimentation
# Organic chemistry
# Botanical, and plant pathology. Poisoning, or infecting, plants with the help of bacteria.
# Preparations for bacteriological warfare

==Mission==

The main purpose of Unit 100 was to conduct research about diseases originating from animals. As most armies were still heavily dependent on horses, the Imperial Japanese Army hoped to find ways to kill them and therefore to weaken military power. Furthermore, they hoped to spread disease via animal carriers. To this end, former members claim that experiments were also conducted with human beings. In practice, Unit 731 was the group tasked with developing biological weapons against humans. Although smaller than Unit 731, Unit 100 was still a large organization. Its annual bacteria production capacity was projected to reach 1,000 kg of anthrax, 500 kg of glanders, and 100 kg of red rust (fungus). The goal was never reached, due to equipment shortages.

Senior Sgt. Kazuo Mitomo described some of Unit 100&#x27;s human experiments:
:&quot;I put as much as a gram of heroin into some porridge and gave this porridge to an arrested Chinese citizen who ate it; about 20 minutes later he lost consciousness and remained in that state until he died 15-16 hours later. We knew that such a dose of heroin is fatal, but it did not make any difference to us whether he died or lived. On some of the prisoners I experimented 5-6 times, testing the action of Korean bindweed, bactal and castor oil seeds. One of the prisoners of Russian nationality became so exhausted from the experiments that no more could be performed on him, and Matsui ordered me to kill that Russian by giving him an injection of potassium cyanide. After the injection, the man died at once. Bodies were buried in the unit&#x27;s cattle cemetery.&quot;

Unit chief Yujiro Wakamatsu ordered Hirazakura to purchase hundreds of cattle and put them to pasture along the Siberian border north-east of Hailar, ready to be infected by airborne dispersion. It was hoped that in the event of a Soviet invasion these infected livestock would mingle with local herds to cause epidemics and to destroy food supplies.

Unit 100 staff poisoned and drugged Russians, Chinese and Koreans with heroin, castor oil, tobacco and other substances for weeks at a time. Some died during the experimentation. When survivors were determined to no longer be useful for experimentation and were complaining of illness, staff told them they would receive a shot of medicine, but instead executed them with potassium cyanide injections. Executions were also carried out by gunshots.

== Capabilities ==
Unit 100 could produce 1,000 kilograms of anthrax bacteria, 500 kilograms of glanders bacteria, and 100 kilograms of redrust bacteria in a single year.

== Members ==
* Otozō Yamada, Direct controller, 1944-1945
* Lieutenant General Takahashi, Chief of the Veterinary Administration of the Kwantung Army
* Hirazakura Zensaku, officer of the 1st and 2nd division from July 1942 to December 1943. Was in the 6th division from December 1943 until April 1944. He was then at Unit 543 until the end of the war.
* Fukuzumi Mitsuyoshi, doctor
* Sakurashita Kiyoshi, civilian employee
* Hataki Akira, civilian employee
* Wakamatsu, Major General of the Veterinary Service

==Biological warfare agents==
The following potential agents were tested:
*&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, which causes plague
*&quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;, which causes Glanders in horses: Kuwabara gave testimony after World War II that Unit 100 released horses infected with Glanders.
*&quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, which causes anthrax

The song was released on their 1973 debut studio album. Released as a single in November 1974, &quot;Free Bird&quot; debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on November 23 at No. 87
and became the band&#x27;s second Top 40 hit in early 1975, peaking at No. 19 on January 25.
A live version of the song re-entered the charts in late 1976,
eventually peaking at No. 38 in January 1977.

&quot;Free Bird&quot; achieved No. 3 on &quot;Guitar World&#x27;s&quot; list of greatest guitar solos of all time in 2010 and 2016, while placing at No. 8 in their rankings by 2022. It is Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s signature song, the finale during live performances, and their longest song, often going well over 14 minutes when played live. &quot;Free Bird&quot; was once the most requested song on FM radio, and remains a staple on classic rock stations.

== Origins ==
According to guitarist Gary Rossington, for two years after Allen Collins wrote the initial chords, vocalist Ronnie Van Zant insisted that there were too many for him to create a melody in the belief that the melody needed to change alongside the chords. After Collins played the unused sequence at rehearsal one day, Van Zant asked him to repeat it, then wrote out the melody and lyrics in three or four minutes. The guitar solos that finish the song were added originally to give Van Zant a chance to rest, as the band was playing several sets per night at clubs at the time. Soon afterward, the band learned piano-playing roadie Billy Powell had written an introduction to the song; upon hearing it, they included it as the finishing touch and had him formally join as their keyboardist.

In subsequent interviews, Gary Rossington stated that the record company executives initially felt the song was too long and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t get any airplay&quot;, and that it &quot;needed to be shortened to 3 or 3-1/2 minutes for radio&quot;. Also, the band was told, &quot;Why would you ruin a pretty song like that with a wild &quot;LSD-type&quot; ending?&quot; Rossington stated that the band refused to change the length of the song and that &quot;we weren&#x27;t changing our ways, hell no&quot;. 

Allen Collins&#x27;s girlfriend, Kathy, whom he later married, asked him, &quot;If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?&quot; Collins noted the question and it eventually became the opening line of &quot;Free Bird.&quot; Also, in an interview filmed during a fishing outing on a boat with Gary Rossington, an interviewer asked Ronnie Van Zant what the song meant. Van Zant replied that in essence, that the song is &quot;what it means to be free, in that a bird can fly wherever he wants to go.&quot; He further stated that &quot;everyone wants to be free...that&#x27;s what this country&#x27;s all about.&quot;

The song is dedicated to the memory of Duane Allman by the band in their live shows. During their 1975 performance on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, Van Zant dedicated the song to both Allman and Berry Oakley, commenting, &quot;they&#x27;re both free birds&quot;.

During the 1987–1988 Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour, the band played &quot;Free Bird&quot; as an instrumental. Johnny Van Zant first sang the song on its Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991 Tour in Baton Rouge, where the band had been headed in 1977 when several members were killed in a plane crash.

==Reception==
Upon the single release, &quot;Record World&quot; said that the band &quot;sees this country-tinged tune soar to further feather their hit nest.&quot;

&quot;Free Bird&quot; is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and at number 407 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2009, it was named the 26th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.

In 2008, the 1973 recording of &quot;Free Bird&quot; from the &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd (Pronounced &#x27;Lĕh-&#x27;nerd &#x27;Skin-&#x27;nerd)&quot; album on MCA Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
On Skynyrd&#x27;s first live album, 1976&#x27;s &quot;One More from the Road&quot;, Van Zant can be heard asking the crowd, &quot;What song is it you want to hear?&quot; The calls for &quot;Free Bird&quot; led into a fourteen-and-a-half-minute rendition of the song. It has become something of a humorous tradition for audience members at concerts to shout &quot;Free Bird!&quot; as a request to hear the song, regardless of the performer or style of music. For example, during Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; show, a shout-out for &quot;Free Bird!&quot; eventually resulted in a lyrically slurred, if short, rendition of &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. An attendee of a Bob Dylan concert on June 9, 2016 in Berkeley, California, shouted during the last encore for &quot;Free Bird&quot; to be played, and Dylan and his band unexpectedly obliged, performing an instrumental snippet of the song as the closing track of the show.

<doc id="1124305" wikidata="Q8353114" url="?curid=1124305" title="My Generation">
<text>&quot;My Generation&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Who, written by guitarist and primary songwriter Pete Townshend. One of the band&#x27;s most recognizable songs, it was placed number 11 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on its list of the “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” in 2004 and 2010, re-ranked number 232 in the 2021 edition. It became part of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and is inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value. It is considered one of the band&#x27;s signature songs.

“My Generation” was released as a single on 29 October 1965, reaching No. 2 in the United Kingdom (The Who&#x27;s highest-charting single in their home country along with 1966&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot;) and No. 74 in the United States. The song also appeared on The Who&#x27;s 1965 debut album, &quot;My Generation&quot; (&quot;The Who Sings My Generation&quot; in the United States), and in greatly extended form on their live album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; (1970).

==Inspiration==
Townshend reportedly wrote the song on a train and is said to have been inspired by the Queen Mother, who is alleged to have had Townshend&#x27;s 1935 Packard hearse towed off a street in Belgravia because she was offended by the sight of it during her daily drive through the neighbourhood. Townshend has also credited Mose Allison&#x27;s &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; as the inspiration for the song, saying &quot;Without Mose I wouldn&#x27;t have written &#x27;My Generation&#x27;.&quot; Townshend told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1985 that &quot;&#x27;My Generation&#x27; was very much about trying to find a place in society.&quot;

On a later interview for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, in 1989, the band was discussing the upcoming 1989 tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Tommy&quot;, and Townshend talked about the famous line &quot;I hope I die before I get old.&quot; He said that, for him, when he wrote the lyrics, &quot;old&quot; meant &quot;very rich&quot;.

==Composition==

The song&#x27;s lyrics comprise a distilled statement of youthful rebellion. The&#x27;s song&#x27;s melody and composition is considered a forebear to punk rock. One of the most quoted—and patently rewritten—lines in rock history is &quot;I hope I die before I get old,&quot; famously sneered by lead singer Roger Daltrey.

Like much of The Who&#x27;s earlier Mod output, the song showcases influences of American rhythm and blues, most explicitly in the call and response form of the verses. Daltrey would sing a line, and the backing vocalists, Pete Townshend (low harmony) and John Entwistle (high harmony), would respond with the refrain &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my generation&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
People try to put us d-down (Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-get around (Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my generation)
I hope I die before I get old (Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout my generation)
&lt;/poem&gt;

The vocal melody of &quot;My Generation&quot; is an example of the shout-and-fall modal frame. This call and response is mirrored in the instrumental break with solo emphasis passing from Townshend&#x27;s guitar to Entwistle&#x27;s bass and back again several times.

Another salient aspect of &quot;My Generation&quot; is Daltrey&#x27;s delivery: an angry and frustrated stutter. Various stories exist as to the reason for this distinct delivery. One is that the song began as a slow talking blues number without the stutter (in the 1970s it was sometimes performed as such, but with the stutter, as &quot;My Generation Blues&quot;), but after being inspired by John Lee Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Stuttering Blues&quot;, Townshend reworked the song into its present form. Another reason is that it was suggested to Daltrey that he stutter to sound like a British mod on speed (amphetamines). It is also proposed, albeit less frequently, that the stutter was introduced to give the group a framework for implying an expletive in the lyrics: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you all fff ... fade away!&quot; However, producer Shel Talmy insisted it was simply &quot;one of those happy accidents&quot; that he thought they should keep. Roger Daltrey has also commented that he had not rehearsed the song prior to the recording, was nervous, and he was unable to hear his own voice through the monitors. The stutter came about as he tried to fit the lyrics to the music, and Talmy decided it worked well enough to keep. The BBC initially refused to play &quot;My Generation&quot; because it did not want to offend people who stutter, but it reversed its decision after the song became more popular.

The instrumental elements of the song are fast and aggressive. Significantly, &quot;My Generation&quot; also featured one of the first bass solos in rock history. This was played by Entwistle on his Fender Jazz Bass, rather than the Danelectro bass he wanted to use; after buying three Danelectros with rare thin strings that kept breaking easily (and were not available separately), a frustrated Entwistle used his Fender strung with nylon tapewound strings and was forced to simplify the solo. The song&#x27;s coda features drumming from Keith Moon, as well, whereupon the song breaks down in spurts of guitar feedback from Townshend&#x27;s Rickenbacker, rather than fading out or ending cleanly on the tonic. There are two guitar parts. The basic instrumental track (as reflected on the instrumental version on the My Generation Deluxe edition) followed by Townshend&#x27;s overdubs including the furious feedback on the coda. Similarly to The Kinks&#x27;s &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; (also produced by Shel Talmy), the song modulates from its opening key of G up to C via the keys of A and B. Townshend&#x27;s guitars were tuned down a whole step for the recording.

For the band the song was the basis for an extended medley or improvisation, going on as long as fifteen minutes, as evinced by the version appearing on &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;. Live recordings from 1969 to 1970 include snippets of music from &quot;Tommy&quot; as well as parts of what would become &quot;Naked Eye&quot;.

Townshend&#x27;s demo version of the song (together with a demo of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;) appeared on a flexi disc included in the original edition of the book &quot;The Who: Maximum R&amp;B&quot; by Richard Barnes.

The Who re-recorded the song for the &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; EP in 1966; ultimately it was not included, and remained unissued until the 1995 remaster of &quot;A Quick One&quot;. The main difference between this version and the original is that it is heavily abridged and instead of the hail of feedback which closes the original, the band play a chaotic rendition of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. In the album&#x27;s liner notes the song is thus credited to both Pete Townshend and Elgar.

==Reception==
In 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number six on their list of the 20 greatest The Who songs, and in 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number three on their list of the 50 greatest The Who songs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the song the eleventh greatest song on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list in 2004 and 2011, re-ranked to number 232 in the 2021 edition. In 2009, VH1 named it the thirty-seventh Greatest Hard Rock Song. It is also part of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and is inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant&quot; value.

The song has been said by &quot;NME&quot; to have &quot;encapsulated the angst of being a teenager&quot;, and has been characterized as a &quot;nod to the Mod counterculture&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; journalist Larry Bartleet in 2015 rated the Who&#x27;s recording ten points out of ten. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;rollicking, blues-drenched handclapper which sez that today&#x27;s kids have more rights than their elders think.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;The young generation will find that this generates good times.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The song was released as a single on 29 October 1965, reaching No. 2 in the UK, The Who&#x27;s highest-charting single in their home country and No. 74 in America.

<text>The Jingda Expressway () is an expressway in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, starting from Beijing and ending in Datong, in Shanxi province. It is 334 km in length and was completed in full on November 16, 2002.

The Jingda Expressway is formed mainly by the main trunk route from Beijing to Datong in three stages. Leaving Beijing, the Jingda Expressway becomes the Badaling Expressway. After Kangzhuang in Yanqing County, it becomes the Jingzhang Expressway. Finally, it becomes the Xuanda Expressway.

As of September 2004, traffic has been clogging up more and more in the area. Due to the massive transportation of coal, what was a very smooth route in the summer is now clogged up with immense traffic jams.

<text>The spiedie () is a food consisting of marinated meat that is often threaded onto skewers before being grilled and served on a long bread roll or sliced Italian bread. Spiedies are local to Binghamton in the central Southern Tier of New York, and somewhat more broadly known and enjoyed throughout Central New York. A spiedie consists of cubes of chicken, pork, lamb, veal, venison, beef, or tofu. The meat is marinated overnight or longer, then grilled on spits over a charcoal pit.

The traditional method involves serving freshly prepared cubes of lamb, chicken, or beef on soft Italian bread or a submarine roll, occasionally drizzled with fresh marinade. Spiedie meat can also be eaten straight off the skewer or can be served in salads, stir fries, and a number of other dishes. The marinade recipe varies, usually involving olive oil, vinegar, and a variety of Italian spices and fresh mint.

Spiedies have been celebrated at the Spiedie Fest and Balloon Rally in Binghamton, New York, every August since 1983. The annual event includes a spiedie cook-off in search of the best spiedie recipes.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;spiedie&quot; is derived from the meaning spit. The regional dish called or in Abruzzo, Italy, most closely resembling spiedie, uses cubes or balls of goat meat, lamb, chicken or beef on a skewer.

==History==
The original idea for the spiedie was brought by Italian immigrants to upstate New York in the early 1920s. The specific origin of the spiedie is disputed. Traditionally, the early Broome County spiedie was made only from spring lamb, but currently most commercial restaurants prepare spiedies using chicken or pork. The &quot;chicken category&quot; was added to the Spiedie Fest cook-off in 1987, and quickly became the most popular meat choice.

===Origins===
Camillo Iacovelli created the spiedie in Endwell, New York, and was serving them in 1938 at his Parkview Restaurant on Oak Hill Ave in Endicott. His brother, Agostino &quot;Augie&quot; Iacovelli, popularized spiedies when he introduced them in his Endicott restaurant Augie&#x27;s in 1939. Iacovelli&#x27;s marinade, which he called &quot;zuzu,&quot; originally was made simply from wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, garlic and mint. Italian spices, olive oil and minced onion were added later as regional tastes and the choice of meat began to vary. Augie Iacovelli&#x27;s son Guido continued in the spiedie business into the 1990s, owning as many as 26 restaurants at the peak of his career.

Peter Sharak is also alleged to have invented spiedies, and began serving them in 1947 at his Sharkey&#x27;s Bar and Grill in Binghamton. Sharkey&#x27;s promotes itself as the birthplace of the sandwich in television commercials across the greater Binghamton area.

===Growth in popularity===

In 1975, Rob Salamida became the first person to bottle the sauce and sell it. He began by cooking spiedies outside a local tavern at 16. After writing letters for over a year, he was allowed to have his own booth at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, New York. For 12 years he built his reputation at the fair. After a tornado nearly struck his stand in 1975, he decided it would be more lucrative and safer to bottle a spiedie marinade.

One of the most popular shops to purchase spiedies in the Southern Tier, as popularity for the marinades and sandwiches grew, was Lupo&#x27;s. Lupo&#x27;s marinades and spiedies are still available locally in the single remaining Binghamton store but products are also available for purchase online.

In 1983, a few families got together and held a Spiedie Fest that was a tremendous hit. Coupled with a Balloon Rally, it quickly grew to an annual festival attracting more than 100,000 attendees (and also one of the top balloon rallies in the country).

In 2013, President Barack Obama visited Binghamton University to promote his affordable college plan and joked that he was going to get a spiedie while in Binghamton.

<text>The Mazda Xedos is a range of executive cars that were launched by Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1992.

The original model was the [[Mazda Xedos 6]], which was similar in size and in engine to the BMW 3 Series. The Xedos 6 has two types of engines - 24 valve V6 @ 144 hp named KF and 16 valve L4 @ 107 hp named B6. In 1994, Xedos Mazda renewed the Xedos 6 model with changes in engine ecological standards and body exterior. 
The Xedos 6 was marketed as the Eunos 500 in Japan and Australia. This vehicle was not sold in the United States and Canada. The total quantity of Xedos 6 and Eunos 500 manufactured is 72101.

By 1994, there was a larger model called the [[Mazda Xedos 9]], which was of a similar size to the BMW 5 Series. The Xedos 9 was marketed as the Eunos 800 in Japan and Australia, and as the Mazda Millenia in the United States.

Neither version of the Xedos was popular, and a facelift in 1998 did little to improve matters. Production ceased in 2000.

<text>George P. Pelecanos (born February 18, 1957) is an American author, producer and television writer. Many of his 20 books are in the genre of detective fiction and set primarily in his hometown of Washington, D.C. On television, he frequently collaborates with David Simon, writing multiple episodes of Simon&#x27;s HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Treme&quot;, and is also the co-creator (with Simon) of the HBO series &quot;The Deuce&quot; and &quot;We Own This City&quot;.

==Early life==
Pelecanos, a Greek American, was born in Washington, D.C., in 1957.

==Career==

===Novelist===

Pelecanos acknowledged that Elmore Leonard was a prime influence on him as an author. In addition to Leonard, he cited the works of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, John D. MacDonald, Ross Macdonald, Mickey Spillane, and John le Carré for getting him hooked on crime fiction.

Pelecanos&#x27;s early novels were written in the first person voice of Nick Stefanos, a Greek D.C. resident and sometime private investigator.

After the success of his first four novels, the Stefanos-narrated &quot;A Firing Offense&quot;, &quot;Nick&#x27;s Trip&quot;, and &quot;Down by the River Where the Dead Men Go&quot;, and the non-series (though some characters do cross over) &quot;Shoedog&quot;, Pelecanos switched his narrative style considerably and expanded the scope of his fiction with his D.C. Quartet. He has commented that he did not feel he had the ability to be this ambitious earlier in his career. The quartet, often compared to James Ellroy&#x27;s L.A. Quartet, spanned several decades and communities within the changing population of Washington. Now writing in the third person, Pelecanos relegated Stefanos to a supporting character and introduced his first &quot;salt and pepper&quot; team of crime fighters, Dimitri Karras and Marcus Clay.

In &quot;The Big Blowdown&quot;, set a generation before Karras and Clay would appear (the 1950s), Pelecanos followed the lives of dozens of D.C. residents, tracking the challenges and changes that the second half of the twentieth century presented to Washingtonians. &quot;King Suckerman&quot;, set in the 1970s and generally regarded as the fans&#x27; favorite, introduced the recurring theme of basketball in Pelecanos&#x27; fiction. Typically, he employs the sport as a symbol of cooperation amongst the races, suggesting the dynamism of D.C. as reflective of the good will generated by multi-ethnic pick up games. However, he also indulges the reverse of the equation, wherein the basketball court becomes the site of unresolved hostilities. In such cases, violent criminal behavior typically emerges amongst the participants, usually escalating the mystery. &quot;The Sweet Forever&quot; (1980s) and &quot;Shame the Devil&quot; (1990s) closed the quartet and Pelecanos retired Stefanos and the other characters that populated the novels. (Stefanos and other characters do reappear in subsequent works).

In 2001, he introduced a new team of private detectives, Derek Strange and Terry Quinn, as the protagonists of &quot;Right as Rain&quot;. They have subsequently starred in the author&#x27;s more recent works &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; (which won a Gumshoe Award in 2003) and &quot;Soul Circus&quot;. While these books have cemented the author&#x27;s reputation as one of the best current American crime writers and sold consistently, they have not garnered the critical and cult affection his D.C. quartet did. Rather, they seem to be continuing the author&#x27;s well received formula of witty protagonists chasing unconflicted criminals behind the backdrop of popular culture references and D.C. landmarks.

Perhaps sensing this, Pelecanos again switched his focus in his 2004 novel, &quot;Hard Revolution&quot;, taking one of his new detectives, Derek Strange, back in time to his early days on the D.C. police force. In another interesting move, Pelecanos attached a CD to the book itself, emulating Michael Connelly who included a CD with his 2003 Harry Bosch book &quot;Lost Light.&quot;

In 2005, Pelecanos saw another novel published, &quot;Drama City&quot;. This book revisited the examination of dogfighting begun in his book &quot;Hell To Pay&quot;. Pelecanos is a dog owner and has written about his views of dogfighting.

In 2006 he published &quot;The Night Gardener&quot;, which was a major change of style and which featured a cameo of himself. Pelecanos has also published short fiction in a variety of anthologies and magazines, including &quot;Measures of Poison&quot; and &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;. His reviews have been published in &quot;The Washington Post Book World&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, and elsewhere.

&quot;The Turnaround&quot; was published in August 2008, reflecting a return to his roots, as the novel opens in the 70s in a Greek diner, and a continuation of his more modern style in the portion set in the present. &quot;The Turnaround&quot; won the 2008&#x27;s Hammett Prize.

In 2011, Pelecanos published &quot;The Cut&quot;, introducing the character Spero Lucas, a young veteran of the Iraq war. The former Marine works part-time as a private investigator for a D.C. defense attorney as well as taking jobs finding stolen items for a 40% cut of the value of the returned item. In 2013, Pelecanos published &quot;The Double&quot;, the second Spero Lucas book.

Pelecanos has in turn influenced other novelists. They include Kristen Lepionka, who won the Shamus Award for Best First P.I. Novel in 2018. Lepionka cited his &quot;lean, laconic prose.&quot; The introduction to a 2018 interview with William Boyle pointed to Pelecanos&#x27;s influence on Boyle, in particular as a &quot;meticulous chronicler of process.&quot;

===Film and television===
Pelecanos has written and produced for HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; and is part of a literary circle with &quot;The Wire&quot; creator David Simon and novelist Laura Lippman. Simon sought out Pelecanos after reading his work. Simon was recommended his novels several times but did not read his work initially because of territorial prejudice; Simon is from Baltimore. Once Simon received further recommendations, including one from Lippman, he tried &quot;The Sweet Forever&quot; and changed his mind. The two writers have much in common including a childhood in Silver Spring, Maryland, attendance at the University of Maryland, and their interest in the &quot;fate of the American city and the black urban poor&quot;. They first met at the funeral of a mutual friend shortly after Simon delivered the pilot episode. Simon pitched Pelecanos the idea of &quot;The Wire&quot; as a novel for television about the American city as Pelecanos drove him home. Pelecanos was excited about the prospect of writing something more than simple mystery for television as he strived to exceed the boundaries of genre in his novels.

Pelecanos joined the crew as a writer for the first season in 2002. He wrote the teleplay for the season&#x27;s penultimate episode, &quot;Cleaning Up&quot;, from a story by Simon and Ed Burns. Pelecanos was promoted to producer for the second season in 2003. He wrote the teleplay for the episodes &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; and &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; from stories he co-wrote with Simon. He remained a writer and producer for the third season in 2004. He wrote the teleplay for the episodes &quot;Hamsterdam&quot; and &quot;Middle Ground&quot; from stories he co-wrote with Simon. Simon wrote the teleplay for the episode &quot;Slapstick&quot; from a story he co-wrote with Pelecanos. Simon and Pelecanos&#x27; collaboration on &quot;Middle Ground&quot; received the show&#x27;s first Emmy Award nomination, in the category Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Pelecanos left the production staff of &quot;The Wire&quot; after the show&#x27;s third season to concentrate on writing his novel &quot;The Night Gardener&quot;. His role as a producer was taken on by Eric Overmyer.
Pelecanos remained a writer for the fourth season in 2006. He wrote the teleplay for the penultimate episode &quot;That&#x27;s Got His Own&quot; from a story he co-wrote with producer Ed Burns. Simon has commented that he missed having Pelecanos working on the show full-time but was a fan of &quot;The Night Gardener&quot;. Simon also spent time embedded with a homicide unit while researching his own book &quot;&quot;. Pelecanos and the writing staff won the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2008 ceremony and the 2007 Edgar Award for Best Television Feature/Mini-Series Teleplay for their work on the fourth season. Pelecanos returned as a writer for the series fifth and final season. He wrote the teleplay for the episode &quot;Late Editions&quot; from a story he co-wrote with Simon. Pelecanos and the writing staff were again nominated for the WGA award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2009 ceremony for their work on the fifth season but &quot;Mad Men&quot; won the award.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Wire&quot; Pelecanos joined the crew of the HBO World War II mini-series &quot;The Pacific&quot; as a co-producer and writer. After a lengthy production process the series aired in 2010. He co-wrote &quot;Part 3&quot; of the series with fellow co-producer Michelle Ashford. The episode focused on Marines on leave in Australia and featured a displaced Greek family in a prominent guest role. Pelecanos saw the project as a chance to make a tribute to his father, Pete Pelecanos, who served as a Marine in the Philippines.

Also in 2010 Pelecanos joined the crew of HBO New Orleans drama &quot;Treme&quot; as a writer. The series was created by Simon and Overmeyer. It follows the lives of residents of the Tremé neighborhood after Hurricane Katrina. Pelecanos wrote the teleplay for the episode &quot;At the Foot of Canal Street&quot; from a story he co-wrote with Overmyer. Pelecanos returned as a Consulting Producer and writer for the second season in 2011. He joined the crew full-time as a writer and executive producer for the third season in 2012. He remained in this role for the fourth and final season in 2013.

Following the conclusion of &quot;Treme&quot; Pelecanos worked with Overmyer on his next series &quot;Bosch&quot;. The series was developed by Overmyer and is based on the series of novels by Michael Connelly. The series stars &quot;The Wire&quot; alumni Jamie Hector and Lance Reddick. Pelecanos and Michael Connelly co-wrote the show&#x27;s fourth episode &quot;Fugazi&quot;.

In 2017, HBO premiered &quot;The Deuce&quot;, a new series developed by Pelecanos and David Simon. The show focuses on the birth of the pornography industry in 1970s Times Square. George also co-authored several of the teleplays, including the pilot, with Simon, and co-authored episodes with Richard Price and Lisa Lutz.

In 2019, Pelecanos&#x27; D.C. Noir anthology was made into a film featuring several short fictional crime stories which take place in Washington, D.C. Pelecanos wrote the film and also served as a director and executive producer. The film was shot on location in Washington, D.C., and is reminiscent of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot;.

He is currently developing a series based on his Derek Strange character for HBO. The first season will be based on the Derek Strange novel &quot;Hard Revolution&quot;. More recently, he signed an overall deal with HBO.

<text>The I-94 derecho was a progressive derecho that moved through the Upper Mississippi Valley on July 19, 1983. It is so called because the derecho moved through Minnesota and Wisconsin with I-94 as its axis.

The derecho formed as an area of disturbed weather in eastern Montana moved eastward. It moved into northwestern North Dakota at around 7a.m. CDT forming a small bow echo. Williston and Minot reported winds up to .

Further development formed two and three bow echo segments as the storm moved into Minnesota. Winds of were recorded at the Alexandria airport. The winds damaged and destroyed hangars. It continued southeast and arrived at Minneapolis, Minnesota at around 4p.m. CDT and left 250,000 people without power.

Trees were blown over and buildings damaged as the derecho raced through Wisconsin. A meteorologist working at the University of Wisconsin–Madison saw the derecho approach from the southeastern shore of Lake Mendota near Madison, Wisconsin. On the university&#x27;s campus, the windows were blown out of the second and third stories of the library. Tiles from the roof were blown off and landed several blocks to the southeast. The strong winds resulted in waves on Lake Mendota.

The derecho started moving into northern Illinois at around 9p.m. CDT. National Weather Service meteorologist Richard Koeneman recorded observations in his weather diary, noting that the evening was &quot;warm and humid&quot;, but that the temperature dropped in 20 minutes ( from 9:30 to 9:50 as the derecho passed. He also wrote that the wind had gusted to around .

The derecho winds were still strong as it moved into the northwestern side of Chicago. A wind gust of was recorded at O&#x27;Hare International Airport. The derecho finally died out over northwestern Indiana at around midnight on July 20.

The storm was responsible for 34 injuries, including 12 from mobile homes being overturned and 8 from falling trees.

<doc id="1124333" wikidata="Q1420996" url="?curid=1124333" title="Rost (crater)">
<text>Rost is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southwestern part of the Moon, to the southeast of the elongated formation Schiller. To the southeast of Rost is the larger crater Scheiner. West-southwest of this formation is the smaller Weigel.

This crater is a circular formation with a low rim and a relatively featureless inner wall and interior floor. There are some tiny craterlets around the rim, including one across the northwest wall and another on the inner wall to the south. The interior has no significant features, with only a tiny craterlet to mark the surface.

Rost lies east of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin, and the outer rim of the basin lies between Rost and Rost A.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rost.

<text>The Mazda Xedos 6 and Eunos 500 are compact executive cars that were produced between 1992 and 1999, with the Xedos 6 being sold in Europe by Mazda, and the Eunos 500 being sold in Japan and Australia by Eunos. The cars were not sold in North America, with the larger Xedos 9/Millenia model offered there instead. In total, 72,101 Xedos 6 and Eunos 500 automobiles were produced.

==History==
The Eunos 500 was initially presented at the 1991 Tokyo Motor Show, and was based on the Mazda CA platform, also used by the Mazda Capella. The car entered full production in January 1992, with Japanese and Australian market models using the Eunos 500 name (as they were sold under the Eunos brand, and not the Mazda brand) and British models utilizing the Mazda Xedos 6 name. Left-hand drive versions of the Xedos 6, destined for mainland Europe, were first produced in 1993. The car&#x27;s exterior styling was often praised by reviewers, with Honest John stating that it &quot;could have been the prototype for a new small Jaguar - with Mazda reliability,&quot; however, the interior was also criticized for being too dull. There were also plans to market the car under the Amati 300 name, but they did not come to fruition.

The Xedos 6 was available with two different engines: a 1.6-litre straight-four (available in Europe from the beginning of production, in the UK from 1993 onwards) and a 2-litre V6 (available everywhere from the car&#x27;s launch) The 1.6-litre engine produced , and was criticized for being underpowered, whilst the 2-litre engine produced , and was praised for its smooth, free-revving nature. The V6 models were capable of up to with a manual transmission, and with an automatic transmission, and were claimed to be able to do 30-31 miles per gallon (imperial). In comparison, the 1.6-litre models had a top speed of with a manual transmission, or with an automatic. The engines were updated in 1994 to meet the new Euro 1 emissions standards (reducing the power outputs by for the 1.6 and for the 2-litre,) and again in 1996 to meet the new Euro 2 standards. The 1.6-litre versions, as well as the 2.0 Sport model, were withdrawn from production in 1998, a year before the remaining versions were withdrawn.

The Eunos 500 used different engines to the European models. The 1.6-litre engine was not offered in Japan, with the base model instead being a 1.8-litre K8-ZE V6, producing and having a top speed of . The 2-litre V6 was offered in Japan, but in a higher state of tune; Japanese models produced from their KF-ZE engines, and had a top speed of . For 1994, a 1.8-litre straight-four was introduced as the new base model, with a power output of , whilst the 1.8-litre V6 was discontinued. In 1996, following Mazda&#x27;s decision to axe the Eunos brand, the Eunos 500 was rebranded as the Mazda Eunos 500, and remained in production under that name until 1999.

==Motorsport==
The Xedos 6 was used in the British Touring Car Championship in 1993 and 1994. Roger Dowson Engineering ran the works Mazda team in 1993 (under the Mazda Racing Team name,) with the Xedos 6 replacing the 323F that had been used in the previous season. Patrick Watts drove the Xedos 6 during the season, taking his first pole at Snetterton, and three fourth-place finishes. He finished 15th in the championship, two points behind former champion Tim Harvey in the works Renault 19. Mazda were classified eighth, and last, in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship.
For 1994, Roger Dowson Engineering and Team Dynamics ran the works Mazdas, with David Leslie and Matt Neal being entered in a two-car team, but the season would prove to be less successful. Neal was forced to withdraw from the series after suffering injuries from a big crash in the sixth round at Silverstone, whilst Leslie withdrew halfway through the season due to budgetary problems. Leslie&#x27;s best finishes were a pair of eighth positions at the first two rounds, whilst Neal&#x27;s was a tenth at Snetterton. Neal finished 23rd in the championship, level with privateers James Thompson and Nigel Smith, whilst Leslie finished 20th. Mazda were classified tenth, and last, in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. The Xedos 6&#x27;s running gear was later used in a 323F built for the 1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup and driven by Neal.

<doc id="1124336" wikidata="Q2296350" url="?curid=1124336" title="Foster's rule">
<text>Foster&#x27;s rule, also known as the island rule or the island effect, is an ecogeographical rule in evolutionary biology stating that members of a species get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment. For example, it is known that pygmy mammoths evolved from normal mammoths on small islands. Similar evolutionary paths have been observed in elephants, hippopotamuses, boas, sloths, deer (such as Key deer) and humans. It is part of the more general phenomenon of island syndrome which describes the differences in morphology, ecology, physiology and behaviour of insular species compared to their continental counterparts.

The rule was first formulated by van Valen in 1973 based on the study by mammalogist J. Bristol Foster in 1964. In it, Foster compared 116 island species to their mainland varieties. Foster proposed that certain island creatures evolved larger body size (insular gigantism) while others became smaller (insular dwarfism). Foster proposed the simple explanation that smaller creatures get larger when predation pressure is relaxed because of the absence of some of the predators of the mainland, and larger creatures become smaller when food resources are limited because of land area constraints.

The idea was expanded upon in &quot;The Theory of Island Biogeography&quot;, by Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson. In 1978, Ted J. Case published a longer paper on the topic in the journal &quot;Ecology&quot;.

Recent literature has also applied the island rule to plants.

There are some cases that do not neatly fit the rule; for example, artiodactyls have on several islands evolved into both dwarf and giant forms.

The Island Rule is a contested topic in evolutionary biology. Some argue that, since body size is a trait that is affected by multiple factors, and not just by organisms moving to an island, genetic variations across all populations could also cause the body mass differences between mainland and island populations.

<doc id="1124341" wikidata="Q9295685" url="?curid=1124341" title="Japanese submarine I-400">
<text>was an Imperial Japanese Navy &quot;Sentoku&quot;-type (or &quot;I-400&quot;-class) submarine commissioned in 1944 for service in World War II. Capable of carrying three two-seat Aichi M6A1 &quot;Seiran&quot; (Mountain Haze) float-equipped torpedo bombers, the &quot;Sentoku&quot;-class submarines were built to launch a surprise air strike against the Panama Canal. Until 1965, the &quot;Sentaku&quot;-type submarines—&quot;I-400&quot; and her sister ships and —were the largest submarines ever commissioned.

==Design and description==

The &quot;I-400&quot;-class submarines had four diesel engines and carried enough fuel to circumnavigate the world one-and-a-half times. Measuring long overall, they displaced , more than double their typical American contemporaries. Until the commissioning of the United States Navy ballistic missile submarine in 1965, the &quot;I-400&quot;-class were the largest submarines ever commissioned.
The cross-section of the pressure hull had a unique figure-of-eight shape which afforded the strength and stability to support the weight of a large, cylindrical, watertight aircraft hangar, long and in diameter, located approximately amidships on the top deck. The conning tower was offset to port to allow the stowage of three Aichi M6A1 &quot;Seiran&quot; (&quot;Clear Sky Storm&quot;) float-equipped torpedo bombers along the centerline. Aircraft were launched from a catapult on the forward deck forward of the hangar. A collapsible crane allowed the submarine to retrieve her floatplanes from the water.

In addition to the three floatplanes, each &quot;I-400&quot;-class submarine was armed with eight torpedo tubes, all in the bow, with 20 Type 95 torpedoes, a Type 11 deck gun aft of the hangar, three waterproofed Type 96 triple-mount antiaircraft guns mounted atop the hangar—one forward and two aft of the conning tower—and a single Type 96 25 mm antiaircraft gun mounted just aft of the bridge.

&quot;I-400&quot;-class submarines had a rather noisy special trim system that allowed them to loiter submerged and stationary while awaiting the return of their aircraft; demagnetization cables meant to protect against magnetic mines by nullifying the submarine′s magnetic field; an air search radar, two air/surface-search radar sets, and a radar warning receiver; and an anechoic coating intended to make detection of the submarine while submerged more difficult by absorbing or diffusing sonar pulses and dampening reverberations from the submarine&#x27;s internal machinery.

==Construction and commissioning==

Ordered as Submarine No. 5231, &quot;I-400&quot; was laid down on 18 January 1943 by the Kure Naval Arsenal at Kure, Japan. She was launched a year later on 18 January 1944, and was completed and commissioned on 30 December 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====January–May 1945====
Upon commissioning, &quot;I-400&quot; was attached to the Kure Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 1 in the 6th Fleet. She also was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She got underway from Sasebo on the day of her commissioning to begin workups in the western Seto Inland Sea with the submarine , joined in January 1945 by &quot;I-400&quot;′s sister ship . After the United States Army Air Forces conducted a major fire-bombing raid on Tokyo on the night of 9–10 March 1945, the 6th Fleet proposed to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff a retaliatory raid on San Francisco, California, by Aichi M6A1 &quot;Seiran&quot; floatplane bombers launched by the submarines of Submarine Division 1 , but by April 1945 the staff&#x27;s vice chief, Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, had rejected the proposal.

 was in drydock at Kure, Japan, on 19 March 1945 when the United States Navy′s Task Force 58 launched the first Allied air strike against the Kure Naval Arsenal. More than 240 aircraft from the aircraft carriers , , , , , , and attacked Japanese ships in the harbor at Kure. American aircraft strafed &quot;I-400&quot;, which returned fire with her Type 96 25 mm antiaircraft guns, and one of her gunners was killed.

&quot;I-400&quot; visited Moji, Japan, from 5 to 6 April 1945, then returned to Kure. On 14 April 1945, she got underway from Kure with the commander of Submarine Division 1, Captain Tatsunosuke Ariizumi, embarked to make a voyage to Dairen, Manchukuo, to pick up a cargo of fuel oil. She called at Dairen from 20 to 23 April 1945 and loaded 1,700 tons of fuel oil, then headed back to Kure, which she reached on 27 April 1945. While she was at Kure, shipyard workers installed a snorkel aboard her during May 1945.

====Panama Canal operation====

By 1 June 1945, all four submarines of Submarine Division 1—&quot;I-13&quot;, , &quot;I-400&quot;, and &quot;I-401&quot;—had been fueled and equipped with snorkels. &quot;I-400&quot; got underway from Kure on 2 June 1945 for a voyage via the Shimonoseki Strait, the Tsushima Strait, and the Sea of Japan to Nanao Bay on the western coast of Honshu near Takaoka, Japan. On 5 June 1945, she arrived in Nanao Bay, where all four submarines gathered and were joined by six Aichi M6A1 &quot;Seiran&quot; (&quot;Clear Sky Storm&quot;) aircraft of the Kure-based 631st Naval Air Group, which flew in after a stop at Fukuyama, Japan. On 6 June 1945, the submarines and aircraft began training for night air operations in preparation for a surprise Japanese air strike against the Panama Canal in which the submarines would launch ten M6A1 floatplanes, which were to strike the Gatun Locks from the east with six torpedoes and four bombs, emptying Gatun Lake and blocking the canal to shipping for months. During training, the Japanese demonstrated that four trained men could prepare one of the floatplanes for launch from a submarine in seven minutes and that each submarine could assemble, fuel, arm, and launch all three of the floatplanes it carried in 45 minutes. Despite various obstacles—the presence of mines and U.S. Navy submarines and shortages of aviation gasoline—the submarines and aircraft launched a number of simulated air strikes.

While Submarine Division 1 was still at Nanao Bay, the expected imminent fall of Okinawa to U.S. forces and the increasing pace of air strikes by Allied aircraft carriers on the Japanese Home Islands prompted Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to cancel the Panama Canal strike on 12 June 1945 and decide instead to use the submarines and their floatplanes to strike the Allied fleet anchorage at Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. The submarines and aircraft completed their flight training on 19 June 1945, with all of the M6A1 floatplanes taking off from the waters of Nanao Bay that day. One failed to return, and the bodies of its two crewmen later washed ashore on Sadogashima.

====Operation Arashi====

At 13:25 on 25 June 1945, the Combined Fleet issued orders for the attack on Ulithi, dubbed Operation Arashi (&quot;Mountain Storm&quot;). The orders called for &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot; to transport Nakajima C6N1 &quot;Saiun&quot; (Iridiscent Cloud&quot;; Allied reporting name &quot;Myrt&quot;) reconnaissance aircraft to Truk in the Caroline Islands in late July 1945. In Operation Hikari (&quot;Shining Light&quot;), the C6N aircraft were to conduct a reconnaissance of Ulithi, noting the presence and location of Allied aircraft carriers and troop transports. &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; then were to launch a combined total of six M6A1 floatplanes—which were to use the reconnaissance information to assist them in targeting Allied ships—on 17 August 1945 for a nighttime strike under a full moon against the Ulithi anchorage, each pilot receiving a hormone injection to improve his night vision and each plane armed with an bomb. After the strike, the aircraft were to land near the submarines, and &quot;I-13&quot;, &quot;I-14&quot;, &quot;I-400&quot;, and &quot;I-401&quot; all were to proceed to Singapore, where ten new M6A aircraft would await them for embarkation for another strike.

On 13 July 1945, &quot;I-400&quot; departed Nanao Bay bound for Maizuru, Japan, which she reached the same day in company with &quot;I-401&quot;. She began to load ammunition and three months of provisions. After a farewell ceremony for the aircraft crews on 18 July 1945 at the Shiraito Inn at Maizuru attended by the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Tadashige Daigo, &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; got underway for Ōminato in northern Honshu on 20 July 1945, escorted by a minesweeper. After &quot;I-400&quot; arrived at Ōminato on 22 July 1945, all crewmen received a day of shore leave, the aircraft had their Japanese markings replaced with American ones, and each submarine brought aboard a model of the Ulithi anchorage as a training aid for the pilots. &quot;I-400&quot; departed Ōminato at 14:00 on 23 July 1945, followed by &quot;I-401&quot; at 16:00, with Ariizumi embarked aboard the Submarine Division 1 flagship, &quot;I-401&quot;. The two submarines took separate routes in the Pacific Ocean far to the east of Japan, planning to rendezvous off Ponape in the Caroline Islands on 16 August 1945.

&quot;I-400&quot; weathered a typhoon on 28 July 1945. She was east of Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 5 August 1945 when an electrical fire broke out in a control panel on her port side. She surfaced to fight the fire, but her lookouts sighted an American convoy, forcing her to crash-dive. Her crew extinguished the fire while she was submerged, but her interior filled with smoke. To clear the air inside &quot;I-400&quot;, she rose to place her conning tower above the surface, remaining in this posture for the next five hours while she conducted emergency repairs and vented the smoke out of the interior via open conning tower hatches.

Concerned by high levels of activity by American aircraft and surface ships near the planned rendezvous point, Ariizumi aboard decided on 14 August 1945 to alter course to the east of the Marshall Islands and meet &quot;I-400&quot; at a new location south of Ponape that evening. He transmitted the new plans in a coded message to &quot;I-400&quot;, but &quot;I-400&quot; never received the message, and missed the rendezvous.

On 15 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced that hostilities between Japan and the Allies would end that day. At 21:00 on 18 August 1945, Ariizumi aboard &quot;I-401&quot; received orders from the 6th Fleet to cancel the Ulithi attack, and later that day &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; were ordered to proceed to Kure.

====End of war====
On 26 August 1945, &quot;I-400&quot; received orders to hoist a black flag of surrender and to disarm herself. Accordingly, her crew assembled all three of her M6A1 aircraft and catapulted them unmanned into the sea, dumped their bombs overboard, fired all of her torpedoes, and destroyed all of her logs, charts, codebooks, and secret documents.
&quot;I-400&quot; was in the Pacific Ocean east of Honshu on 27 August 1945 when an aircraft from U.S. Navy Task Force 38 sighted her at . The destroyers and intercepted her, and she surrendered to them northeast of Tokyo. The same day, a U.S. Navy prize crew of four officers and 40 enlisted men from the submarine tender set out aboard the destroyer escort to take charge of &quot;I-400&quot;. &quot;Weaver&quot; arrived alongside &quot;I-400&quot; on 28 August 1945 and put the prize crew aboard her, and &quot;I-400&quot; headed for Japan under command of the prize crew, escorted by &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Weaver&quot;. At 09:15 on 29 August 1945, she arrived in Sagami Bay on the coast of Honshu and moored alongside &quot;Proteus&quot;′s port side. At 09:55, &quot;I-14&quot; also arrived under the command of a U.S. Navy prize crew, and she moored alongside &quot;I-400&quot;′s port side.

At 08:20 on 30 August 1945, &quot;I-400&quot; got underway in company with &quot;I-14&quot; and &quot;Proteus&quot; bound for Tokyo Bay, where they anchored at 14:58 the same day. The United States flag was raised aboard her at 05:00 on 31 August 1945, and at 14:45 &quot;I-400&quot;, &quot;I-14&quot;, and &quot;Proteus&quot; began a move to a new anchorage within the breakwater at the submarine base at Yokosuka, where &quot;Proteus&quot; was anchored by 16:50. Twelve U.S. Navy submarines chosen to represent the U.S. Navy Submarine Force at the Japanese surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay also were anchored there, and &quot;I-401&quot; arrived on 31 August as well. During the surrender ceremony on 2 September 1945, the Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC), Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, ordered his personal flag hoisted aboard &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot;.

===Postwar===

The Japanese struck &quot;I-400&quot; from the Navy list on 15 September 1945. On 29 October 1945, &quot;I-401&quot; got underway from Yokosuka southbound for Sasebo with a 40-man American crew aboard in company with &quot;I-401&quot;, &quot;I-14&quot;, and the submarine rescue vessel . The ships encountered a heavy storm during their voyage, and the American crews of &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; noted that the &quot;I-400&quot;-class submarines′ double-hull construction allowed them to ride remarkably smoothly in the heavy seas. The vessels arrived at Sasebo on 1 November 1945.

After loading Japanese motor launches onto their decks to serve as lifeboats, &quot;I-400&quot;, &quot;I-401&quot;, and &quot;I-14&quot; departed Sasebo on 11 December 1945 under escort by &quot;Greenlet&quot; bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, stopping along the way at Apra Harbor on Guam in the Mariana Islands from 18 to 21 December 1945, then at Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, and then at Kwajalein for food and supplies from 26 to 27 December 1945. They arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1946 and tied up at the Submarine Base, where a U.S. Navy band and local celebrities welcomed them. On 18 February 1946, &quot;I-400&quot; entered drydock at Pearl Harbor for evaluation.

==Disposal==

With postwar relations with the Soviet Union deteriorating rapidly and concerns growing in the United States that under postwar agreements the Soviets would demand access to the captured Japanese submarines that would provide the Soviet Navy with valuable information about advanced Japanese submarine designs, the U.S. Navy issued orders on 26 March 1946 to sink all captured Japanese submarines. Accordingly, the U.S. Navy sank &quot;I-400&quot; as a target in tests of the Mark 10 Mod 3 exploder off Pearl Harbor on 4 June 1946. She sank by the stern at 12:10 at after the submarine hit her with three Mark 18 Mod 2 torpedoes. Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC), Vice Admiral Allan R. McCann, and the commander of Submarine Division 52, Commander Lawson P. Ramage, were embarked on &quot;Trumpetfish&quot; to observe the sinking of &quot;I-400&quot;.

==Discovery of wreck==
On 1 August 2013, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory&#x27;s (HURL) deep-diving submersible &quot;Pisces V&quot; located the wreck of southwest of Oahu, Hawaii, at a depth of . What &quot;Pisces V&quot; initially identified as the bow turned out to be a point back from the bow, and the hull was completely intact. The wreck showed signs of heavy implosion damage, however, and &quot;I-400&quot;′s entire superstructure was missing, her conning tower and aircraft hangar apparently having detached from her hull during her final descent to the ocean floor in 1946.

<text>Gian Domenico Romagnosi (; 11 December 1761 – 8 June 1835) was an Italian philosopher, economist and jurist.

==Biography==
Gian Domenico Romagnosi was born in Salsomaggiore Terme.
He studied law at the University of Parma from 1782 to 1786. In 1791 he became the chief civil magistrate of Trento. In the late 18th and early 19th century Trento was successively under the rule of France, Italy and Austria. In 1799 Romagnosi was arrested in Innsbruck during fifteen months by the Austrians on account of his alleged sympathy with the French, but he was acquitted. In 1801 the French occupied Trento, and he was raised to the position of Secretary of the Higher Council. He was successively professor of law at Parma, Pavia, Pisa and Milan. After the fall of Napoleon he lost his position at the Milan university, but continued to lecture till 1817. In 1818 he was again tried for treason at Venice, and again acquitted. Carlo Cattaneo was his student and he was largely influenced by his thought.
He died in Milan in 1835.

His most celebrated work is &quot;Introduzione allo studio del diritto pubblico universale&quot; (2 vols., Parma, 1805).

==Electromagnetism==
Although Romagnosi was not a scientist, he made some experiments with a voltaic pile and its influence on a compass. He published two accounts of his findings in 1802, in Italian newspapers. It is sometimes assumed that he found a relationship between electricity and magnetism, about two decades before Hans Christian Ørsted&#x27;s 1820 discovery of electromagnetism. However, his experiments did not deal with electric currents, and only showed that an electrostatic charge from a voltaic pile could deflect a magnetic needle. However, as Joseph Hamel has pointed out, Romagnosi&#x27;s discovery was documented in the book by Joseph Izarn, &quot;Manuel du Galvanisme&quot; (1805), where a galvanic current (&quot;courant galvanique&quot;) is explicitly mentioned. It was also mentioned on page 340 of the book by Giovanni Aldini, &quot;Essai théorique et expérimental sur le Galvanisme&quot; (1804): &quot;Cette nouvelle propriété du galvanisme a été constatée par d&#x27;autres observateurs, et dernièrement par M. Romanesi, physicien de Trente, qui a reconnu que le galvanisme faisait décliner l&#x27;aiguille aimantée.&quot; That is: &quot;This new property of galvanism has been noted by other observers, and lately by M. Romanesi, a physicist in Trente, who recognized that galvanism made the magnetic needle decline.&quot; Aldini was also communicating with Ørsted at the time, Hamel notes.

<text>The MCW Metrobus is a two and three-axle double-decker bus manufactured by Metro Cammell Weymann (MCW) between 1977 and 1989, with over 4,000 built. The original MkI was superseded by the MkII which had a symmetrical windscreen with an arched top in 1981, although production of the original MkI continued for the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive and London Regional Transport until 1983 and 1985 respectively. The Metrobus was conceived as an integral product manufactured completely by MCW, but Alexander and Northern Counties also bodied some examples.

MCW planned to produce a single-decker version but this was not to come into production.
== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, the Metrobus was mainly used in the metropolitan areas, especially London, West Midlands and Greater Manchester.

=== London ===
London Transport purchased 1,440 MkI examples between 1978 and 1985, numbering them M1 to M1440. Two MkII prototypes were delivered to London Transport for the Alternative Vehicle Evaluation (AVE) programme in 1984, M1441 with a Gardner engine and Voith transmission and M1442 with a Cummins engine and Maxwell transmission, but no orders resulted. In 1987/88, due to a vehicle shortage, 14 were purchased secondhand from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive, West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and Busways Travel and allocated to Potters Bar garage. London Transport&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Harrow Buses leased 29 new MkII Metrobuses in 1987, but returned them to their lessor three years later. London Transport&#x27;s Metrobuses were the mainstay of the double decker fleet between 1987 and privatisation in 1994, when most of them passed to seven of the new operators.

MTL bought the London Northern company, with a host of 179 Metrobuses. It acquired more when it took over London Suburban Buses, and including some ex-London examples from its Merseyside operation. Garages were at North Acton, Holloway and Potters Bar. Metroline Northern operations in London dwindled during 2002, with Ms replaced by low-floor buses on most routes. Some were retained through 2003 to deputise on AEC Routemaster routes, but operation on TfL services ceased in July 2004, the final three examples based at Potters Bar garage being the last Metrobuses in regular London service at the time.

London General reached the end with Metrobuses in normal service in February 2003, when Stockwell Garage&#x27;s last were withdrawn. This left a handful of Metrobuses for special purposes; M1440 and open-top OM171 from the private hire fleet at Sutton and M1435 painted into a &quot;spotted cow&quot; livery for an art exhibition. Some were also retained as driver trainers.

First CentreWest, First Capital and London United also reached the end with Metrobuses in normal service in 2003. Arriva London also continued using Metrobuses until these were finally displaced in 2002/03; however Arriva would operate the final Metrobus in London service (M1332) on the 121 in January 2006.

Some of the MCW Metrobuses were converted to open-top for use by The Original Tour. The last were withdrawn by December 2007. London Pride Sightseeing also had MCW Metrobuses, but these were sold to Ensignbus. By 2014, there were no MCW Metrobuses licensed for use in London.

=== West Midlands ===

The West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive and its successor, West Midlands Travel, also purchased significant numbers of Metrobuses (over 1,100), both MkI and MkII examples. The first order for five MCW Metrobuses was placed in 1977, with the first delivered in January 1978.

Fifty dual-purpose Metrobuses with high-back seats, were purchased in 1986. Many of these buses were converted to normal seated buses and continued in service until November 2008. They were mainly used on limited-stop services. Fourteen guided buses were delivered for route 65 (branded &quot;Tracline 65&quot;), which was the first guided bus system in the UK, although the experiment only lasted a couple of years. All of the 14 guided buses were converted for conventional use. However they were distinguishable by their dot matrix destination display and gap in the front wheel arch where the guidewheels had been fitted.

In early 1995 Marshall Bus of Cambridge were contracted to overhaul all of West Midland Travel&#x27;s Metrobus fleet. This was the largest used bus overhaul programme in Europe at the time and Marshalls set up a dedicated business division and staff to handle it. Many unavailable parts had to be sourced and made to original patterns by the Marshall procurement team. A production line was established in one of Marshall&#x27;s aircraft hangars and anything up to 30 Metrobuses could be found in work at some stage along the line. Duration of refurbishment of each bus was usually 2-3 per week. No powerline items were included with the result that original engines were simply put back in the overhauled buses as they were. This had the effect that as the vehicles were driven from the West Midlands to Marshalls at Cambridge and driven back once completed and frequently broke down. Over 600, mainly MkII, Metrobuses were overhauled with the contract terminated abruptly in 1999 due to lack of confidence in Marshall Bus over delays with WMT orders for new single deck buses. 

The last Metrobuses were withdrawn from regular service in March 2010, being reduced to school services before their final withdrawal on 24 July 2010. A few were retained as driver training vehicles until 2017, however. In 2017 National Express West Midlands purchased a preserved &#x27;Timesaver&#x27; example (D957 NDA, 2957) to add to its vintage hire fleet. National Express West Midlands (then Travel West Midlands) had previously sold this bus to a dealer in 2003. As a result, National Express West Midlands now owns a Metrobus for events and hire.

=== Greater Manchester ===

The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) initially ordered 190 MkI MCW Metrobuses which were delivered between 1979 and 1983, alongside an unfulfilled order of 15 out of 190 Leyland Titans. Five of the PTE&#x27;s early Metrobuses would be sold to London Buses in 1987.

Around 1986, Northern Counties delivered 30 more MCW Metrobuses built with Manchester standard bodywork, intended for the &#x27;Trans Lancs&#x27; 400 express service linking Bolton with Stockport.

=== West Yorkshire ===

The West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and its successor Yorkshire Rider purchased over 100 Metrobuses, a majority of these being MkIIs. Some were bodied with Walter Alexander bodywork. Two MkIIs and two Alexander Metrobuses were sold to London Buses.

One MkII Metrobus was converted by Yorkshire Rider to operate as a demonstrator for a guided busway in Leeds. This made use of parts supplied from West Midlands Travel&#x27;s guided busway Metrobuses.

=== South Yorkshire ===
South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) purchased a total of 170 MkI and MkII Metrobuses following comparative trials in 1979. These were delivered in five batches from 1980 to 1985, with some being specified with dual doors. These were joined by ten MkII Metrobuses in 1986 that were delivered with coach seats for &#x27;Fastline&#x27; express work.

Also in South Yorkshire, Yorkshire Traction took delivery of twelve Metrobuses in 1986, an order initially placed when Yorkshire Traction were a National Bus Company subsidiary. These Metrobuses were unique in that they were built to a low height specification.

=== Other operators ===

In Scotland, the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive and its successor Strathclyde Buses purchased 70 MkI, MkII and Alexander-bodied Metrobuses over from 1979 to the end of production in 1989. Metrobuses with Alexander bodywork proved popular with the Scottish Bus Group, with Midland Scottish taking on a total of 109 by 1986. Most of these would be transferred to Kelvin Scottish following the reorganisation of the SBG.

The Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive bought five Metrobuses on evaluation in 1979. These were sold to London Buses in 1988, where they would become M1481-M1485; these would be the final Metrobuses to be acquired by London Transport before the privatisation of London Buses. Merseybus purchased 25 MkII Metrobuses in 1989 while also acquiring many second hand from privatised London operators. Fifteen Metrobuses, some with Alexander bodywork, were purchased new by the predecessor of Merseybus, Merseyside PTE.

Other municipal bus operators who bought Metrobuses included Kingston upon Hull City Transport, Leicester City Transport, Newport Transport and Reading Transport. The Metrobus also found sales to National Bus Company subsidiaries Maidstone &amp; District and Northern General, with the former ordering two pairs of MkI Metrobuses with MCW and Rolls-Royce engines as part of NBC comparative trials in 1980.

== Hong Kong ==

=== Early introductions ===

In Hong Kong, China Motor Bus (CMB) introduced 12 Metrobuses (MC1-MC12) in 1978 for its luxury coach services (which covered the routes between Repulse Bay, Stanley and the Central District). Within a year, MCW produced an 11-metre 2-axle version of Metrobus. Only 40 were produced for CMB in 1978/79, where they would be classified as MB1-MB40. They were used mostly on express and cross-harbour services. Both batches of CMB Metrobuses had MkI bodies.

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, MCW produced prototypes of 3-axle, 12-metre long &quot;Super-Metrobuses&quot;. Two were purchased by CMB as ML1-ML2 and three by Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) as M1-M3, later renumbered 3M1-3M3. All were bodied with MCW MkII bodies. CMB purchased a further 82 (ML3-84) between 1983 and 1988, while KMB purchased 80 2-axle Metrobuses (M1-M80, with MkII bodies) between 1983 and 1985.

While KMB was not interested in the 12-metre version Super-Metrobuses, they did express their interest in an 11-metre 3-axle version (the CMB 11-metre version Metrobuses were 2-axle) with 254 11-metre 3-axle Metrobuses (S3M1-254) purchased between 1986 and 1989. Fifty of these buses were fitted with Cummins engines, and another one (later numbered S3M145) was originally fitted with a prototype Sutrak air-conditioning system on delivery in 1987, but this proved unreliable and was subsequently removed a year later.

Between 1987 and 1989, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) also purchased 59 2-axle Metrobuses for their feeder bus services. 39 of them (101-139) were brand new with MkII bodies, while another 20 (140-159) were second-hand buses purchased from South Yorkshire PTE with MkI bodies, some of them with dual-doors.

Argos Bus purchased 6 Metrobuses for their non-franchised routes and private hire services between 1988 and 1989. They were from the same batch as those bought second-hand by KCRC.

KMB purchased eight further 2-axle Metrobuses (M81-M88) in 1989. These buses were fitted with Cummins LTA10-B282 (282 hp) engines and Voith D864G 4-speed gearbox, and were used on the hilly KMB Route 51 (between Tsuen Wan and Kam Tin, climbing Tai Mo Shan along its way). Later KMB fitted some of its older Metrobuses with Cummins engines, in order to avoid excess damage to buses running the hilly route.

=== Withdrawal ===

The MkI second-hand Metrobuses were the first to be withdrawn, and all of them have since been scrapped. Many of the KCRC Metrobuses were loaned to Citybus for few years before final withdrawal.

CMB removed its MC-class Metrobuses from the luxury routes after introducing Dennis Darts for the service in 1991, preserving the seating layout. These Metrobuses were allocated to non-luxury routes in the Southern District, Hong Kong, as well as route 13 serving the &quot;Mid-levels&quot;. Although CMB was the first to introduce Metrobuses, it withdrew only 3 of them (all were accident victims) before the end of its franchise in August 1998. Its earliest Metrobuses were 20 years old at that time. New World First Bus purchased all the remaining CMB Metrobuses and Super-Metrobuses when it took over most of the CMB routes, and converted 3 MC-class Metrobuses to training buses. In 2000, the last of the MCW Metrobuses were de-registered, briefly exported to The Original Tour, Big Bus Tours or to Australia. Some of the MCW Metrobuses were brought back to The Original Tour in the year 2006. As of 2013, the last of the examples from United Kingdom were withdrawn.

KMB allocated its 3 Super-Metrobuses to the New Territories for many years. For example, they were serving on route 61A (which connected Tuen Mun and Yuen Long new towns) right before the KCR Light Rail took over the services. After that, they were seen on route 36A (which connected a public housing estate in Kwai Chung to a ferry pier) until the route&#x27;s decline in the mid-1990s. They spent a few further years as spare buses before being withdrawn from passenger service in 1996 and converted to training buses. They were finally sold and scrapped in 2001.

KMB started to withdraw its 2-axle Metrobuses in 1997. Some of them had their chassis damaged due to the fatigue caused during their service on the Tai Mo Shan KMB Route 51, which climbed to the highest altitude achievable by buses in Hong Kong. These were withdrawn by 2003. The 11-metre 3-axle Metrobuses in KMB were not withdrawn until summer 2002. KCRC also started to withdraw their Mark II Metrobuses in the early 2000s. The last 2-axle Metrobus in Hong Kong (KCRC 134) was withdrawn in October 2005.

The last Metrobus in Hong Kong (fleet number S3M233, license no. EH8559) ceased operation on 8 May 2007. As of mid-2011, no more Metrobuses were licensed and in use in Hong Kong.

== End of production ==
Production of the Metrobus ceased in 1989 with the financial collapse of MCW. The last Metrobus built was West Midlands Travel 3124(G124FJW), it had a message from the builders stating that it was the last one built by MCW and signed by the staff on the inside of the roof.

The Metrobus design was purchased by Optare in 1990, which had recently joined the United Bus group with DAF Bus. Despite owning design and production rights, the two companies heavily reworked the design to produce a new vehicle, the DAF DB250 based Optare Spectra, which was launched in 1991 and ceased production in late 2006.

<text>Voulez-Vous (; French for &quot;Do you want (to)?&quot;) is the sixth studio album by the Swedish supergroup ABBA. Released on 23 April 1979, the album yielded five hits, all of them big 1979 singles in Britain – &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; and the double A-side &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;/&quot;Angeleyes&quot;. 

The title track showed the group embracing disco music, which at the time was at its peak. The album topped the charts in a number of countries and ranked among Britain&#x27;s five best-selling albums of the year.

It was the first ABBA album to be mainly recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, and the only ABBA album to include a studio recording made outside Sweden: the instrumental backing track for the title track was partly recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami.

&quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; was first released on CD in 1984. The album has been digitally remastered and reissued four times: first in 1997, then in 2001 and in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, and yet again in 2010 for the &quot;Voulez-Vous Deluxe Edition&quot;.

==Background and production==
In early 1978, ABBA were at the peak of their success and having just completed promotion for their and release, thoughts were turned to the next album, which was planned to be released in time for Christmas. Sessions however proved to be difficult and after starting on 13 March 1978 with the ultimately unreleased track &quot;Dr Claus von Hamlet&quot;, a number of compositions were demoed and rejected. Indeed, after six months, only two songs that would end up on the finished album (&quot;The King Has Lost His Crown&quot; and &quot;Lovers (Live a Little Longer)&quot;) were completed.

During this time the group opened their own recording studio, Polar Studios in Stockholm, which was among the most advanced in the world at the time and would be where ABBA would work from here on. Two songs recorded at this time were &quot;Lovelight&quot; and &quot;Dream World&quot;. However, neither song would appear on the &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; album (&quot;Lovelight&quot; would be used as the B-side to the single &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, while &quot;Dream World&quot; would remain unreleased until 1994; both songs are now featured as bonus tracks on re-issues of the &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; album). Other tracks started but subsequently scrapped included &quot;Just a Notion&quot;, which was later included on &quot;Voyage&quot; (2021).

By September 1978, ABBA had been absent from the charts for some months, and so a song from the recording sessions, &quot;Summer Night City&quot;, was released as a single. Never happy with the finished song, members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus regretted the release and lamented the fact that it peaked lower than previous singles in the charts, not being released at all in the US. They considered the UK to be their most important market, and there it had ended a run of No. 1 hits by stalling at No. 5 - their smallest hit for three years. A full-length version was however still planned for the upcoming album, but ultimately never used. By this time, tensions were growing within the group due to the low productivity of the period, as member Agnetha Faltskog commented; &quot;I can tell from the look in Björn&#x27;s eyes when he gets home how the day&#x27;s work has been. Many times the boys have been working for ten hours without coming up with one single note&quot;. Andersson talked to a reporter at the time saying; &quot;The prospects are not good. It’s worse than ever...We have no idea when we’ll be finished&quot;. It became obvious that the album wouldn&#x27;t be completed by the end of the year and the deadline was extended into 1979. In late 1978, further indication of internal struggles became widely known when it was announced that married couple Ulvaeus and Faltskog were to divorce. Rather than spelling the end for the group however, this freed up a lot of the tensions between the two and in late 1978, work suddenly took off apace for the album.

In October, two tracks were completed: &quot;Angeleyes&quot; and &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for the Nights&quot;. Although seen as an archetype ABBA track, the former of these was deemed dated by Andersson, labelling it &quot;back to the sixties&quot;. The second track however featured an all-out contemporary vibe, being quite disco-orientated and considered the strongest song that had been recorded for the album. It was intended to be not only the next single but also the song that ABBA would perform at the Music for UNICEF Concert in January 1979. This plan was changed however when an even-better song came along in December. With the original title of &quot;In the Arms of Rosalita&quot;, &quot;Chiquitita&quot; was the song the band performed. Although rather more schlager in style, Andersson considered it the best of their new songs, despite the feeling that it was very out of style with the rest of the acts performing that night. &quot;It was pretty strange, but we felt it was the best song we had and that&#x27;s why we chose it, however wrong it may have been&quot;, he said. In early 1979, &quot;Chiquitita&quot; became one of ABBA&#x27;s biggest hits around the world, reaching No. 1 in many countries, although just being clipped by Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; in the UK at No. 2.

At the end of January, Andersson and Ulvaeus left Sweden and rented an apartment in the Bahamas where they felt they could get some inspiration by listening to American music and experiencing a whole different vibe to the rather conservative Stockholm. Two songs emerged from this time; &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; and &quot;Kisses of Fire&quot;. Excited by the former, they went to Criteria Studios in Miami to record the backing track with the disco band Foxy — the only time they recorded a song outside Sweden. Upon returning to Sweden to finish the songs, another track, &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;, was recorded - a song that was to be the next single, and also the only mainstream release to feature Ulvaeus on lead vocals. The single would not become as big a hit worldwide as &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, but was the most successful release from the album in the US.

By the end of March, the final two tracks were finished; &quot;As Good as New&quot; and &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; (the latter featuring a local children&#x27;s choir from the International School of Stockholm).

==Release==
At the end of April the album, titled &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;, was finally ready for release and to emphasize the shift towards a disco sound, the album cover shot was taken at Alexandra&#x27;s night club in Stockholm. The album was released on 23 April 1979, and in the following months of its launch, ABBA released a number of other singles from it. The title track was released as a double A-side with &quot;Angeleyes&quot;, while &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; was belatedly released in December 1979 following their recent world tour. A track recorded in August 1979 (four months after the release of the album), &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, was released as a single in October and was later included as a bonus track on CD versions of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot;.

On 31 May 2010, the deluxe edition of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; was released internationally. It featured a remastered and expanded CD version of the album, with six bonus tracks, along with a companion DVD of TV content from 1978 and 1979. Found on this second disc were: the BBC TV special &quot;ABBA in Switzerland&quot;; the &quot;Chiquitita&quot; performance from the &quot;Music for UNICEF Concert&quot; and another one from &quot;ABBA Snowtime&quot;; a performance of &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for the Nights&quot; from the &quot;Mike Yarwood Christmas Show&quot; (1978); a Björn and Benny interview on the &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;; an extended promo of &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;; two &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot; TV commercials; and the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot;. The reissue also contained a 28-page illustrated booklet with an essay on the making of the album.

The album was reissued for its 40th anniversary on 14 June 2019, as a multi-format release. It included: a double-LP half-speed master of the original album, pressed on 180g vinyl, cut at 45rpm, and mastered at Abbey Road Studios; a colored-vinyl 7&quot; box set of seven singles issued during the &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; era; and stand-alone picture discs of each of these singles.

==Critical reception==
The album received favourable reviews from contemporary music critics. 

The Dutch magazine &quot;Hitkrant&quot; made it &quot;LP of the Week&quot; and stated: &quot;This time, the Swedish foursome has delivered an album that will be talked about for a long time to come, because it namely is of an unprecedented, enormous class.&quot; 

The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; determined that &quot;Frida vocalises with increased assurance, now making words count much more—in fact the lyrics are slowly coming out of their sometimes naivete&quot;. 

Less positively, &quot;Smash Hits&quot;&#x27; reviewer Red Starr found that ABBA &quot;don&#x27;t disappoint but they don&#x27;t exactly inspire either with this clean but clinical collection of European disco-orientated songs. They&#x27;ve still to make an album that conveys the magic and impact of their singles, and this isn&#x27;t it&quot;.

Bruce Eder of AllMusic retrospectively noted that &quot;about half of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; shows the heavy influence of the Bee Gees from their megahit disco era&quot; but that it also &quot;had a pair of soft, lyrical Europop-style ballads&quot; which according to him sounds like &quot;popular folk music during the mid-to-late &#x27;60s&quot;. 

Sean Egan from the &quot;BBC&quot; gave the album a favourable review writing that the album &quot;was an effort that saw Agnetha, Benny, Björn and Anni-Frid put their dancing shoes on to join in with the dominant disco craze&quot; and also that the album&#x27;s ballads &quot;are able to provide a pocket of air on a disco floor that would otherwise get sweaty and stultifying&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; topped the charts Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Finland. In the UK, it entered the charts at No. 1 and remained there for a month), and was a Top 10 success in countries including Canada, New Zealand and Australia. In the US, &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; became ABBA&#x27;s third album to reach the top 20 (peaking at No. 19). It reached number 1 in Japan in 1979.

All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

<text>Taxi 3 () is a 2003 French action comedy film directed by Gérard Krawczyk. Starring Samy Naceri, Frédéric Diefenthal and Marion Cotillard, it is the sequel to &quot;Taxi 2&quot;, and was followed by &quot;Taxi 4&quot;. It is the third installment in the &quot;Taxi&quot; film series.

==Plot==
A group of thieves calling themselves the Santa Claus gang are wreaking havoc, using Santa Claus costumes to commit heists, and the Marseille police are, as usual, unable to keep up. Superintendent Gibert (played by Bernard Farcy) is distracted by a Chinese journalist (Bai Ling) writing a story on his squad, and is unable to stop the robbers.

Detective Emilien&#x27;s wife, Petra, has just announced that she&#x27;s pregnant and taxi driver Daniel (Samy Naceri) is in the midst of a relationship crisis. His long-suffering girlfriend Lilly has walked out on him after finding him customising his taxi at four o&#x27;clock in the morning, and complaining that their house has become a mere garage and how Daniel stopped paying attention to her.

After a string of mistakes in which the thieves outsmart the police time and time again, the journalist is kidnapped. It is revealed that the journalist is the leader of the Santa Claus gang. The police go in search, but Emilien is captured after another botched attempt to arrest them. The journalist sets a trap; she leaves Emilien tied to a chair in an old warehouse, directly in the path of a giant ball which will crush him five minutes later.

At the last moment, Daniel rushes in with his taxi and rescues him. They track the gang to their hideout in the Swiss mountains, where the journalist and her accomplices are arrested by a crack team of Alpine troops. Gibert lands in an ice-bound lake after leaping from an aircraft with them. Petra gives birth, Daniel proposes to Lilly, and a Gibert is seen being pushed around in a wheelchair covered in ice.

==Cast==
==Production==
==Reception==
Empire (magazine) rated it 3 out of 5.
==Video games==
&quot;Taxi 3&quot; – Based on &quot;Taxi 3&quot;. Released in 2003 by Ubisoft Montreal.

==In popular culture==
The opening titles are a spoof of those featured in the movies starring James Bond, and there are several nods to the 007 canon throughout the film, e.g. Daniel&#x27;s rotating number plate and the ski chase at the film&#x27;s climax.

<text>Damodar K. Mavalankar (born September 1857 in Ahmedabad - departed for the Himalayas 1885) was an Indian Theosophist.

==Biography==
He was born in the family of the Karhâda Mahârashtra caste of Brâhmanas, a wealthy Indian family. Apart from learning the tenets of his religion by his father from an early age, he also received a very good English education.

In 1879 he met Henry Steel Olcott and H. P. Blavatsky in Bombay, after they had just established the Theosophical Society&#x27;s temporary Indian headquarters there. Damodar joined the Society in 1879, giving up his caste, and in 1880, he officially became a Buddhist while in Sri Lanka, along with Henry Steel Olcott and H. P. Blavatsky. His actions displeased his family and led to conflict, due to them desiring him to return home and live with his wife who was betrothen to him in his childhood, or face the consequences of being cut out of his will. In response to this, Damodar gave up an income of 50,000 Indian rupees to provide for the future of his wife, and continued to live and work with the Theosophical founders.

He continued his work in this way until 1885, when he went to Tibet.

<doc id="1124360" wikidata="Q1226082" url="?curid=1124360" title="Dimitsana">
<text>Dimitsana () is a mountain village and a former municipality in Arcadia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality Gortynia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 110.759 km2. Dimitsana is built on the ruins of the ancient town Teuthis. It has been registered as a traditional settlement.

Dimitsana is built on a mountain slope at an elevation of 950 meters. From its southern side a marvelous view of the Megalopolis plain and Taygetus is provided. Dimitsana is located 53 km east of Pyrgos, 31 km northwest of Tripoli, 23 km northwest of Megalopoli and 17 km northeast of Andritsaina. The village has a school, a historical library, several churches, a post office, an open-air water-power museum, an open amphitheater, hotels and a square.

==History==

At the site of present-day Dimitsana there was, in ancient times, the ancient Arcadian town Teuthis, which had participated in the Trojan War and the colonization of Megalopolis.

In 963 Philosophou Monastery was founded 2,5 km from Dimitsana. The name of the town is first recorded in 967 in a Patriarchate&#x27;s document related to Philosophou Monastery. The first gunpowder mills of the town were built under the guise of home industry in the middle of the 18th century by Bishop Ananias Lakedaimonias, who paved a revolt against the Turks. In 1764 the movement was revealed and Ananias and his partners were killed. In the same year Agapios, a wise monk, built a library, where he moved the books of the monastery. The library was growing constantly until 1821, as the Patriarchate offered new books and there was a seminary, known as &quot;Φροντιστήριο Ελληνικών Γραμμάτων&quot; (Tuition Centre of Greek Literature). A lot of bishops and scholars graduated from it, among them Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople and Germanos III of Old Patras, whose houses have survived in the town.

After the Orlov events, some inhabitants of Dimitsana bearing the name &quot;Tasoulis&quot; () migrated to Minor Asia fleeing the Albanian ravaging of Peloponnese. Upon arrival in Koldere, in 1777, near Magnesia (ad Sipylum), they changed their name &quot;Tasopoulos&quot; ().

Ιn the Greek War of Independence the Dimitsana gunpowder mills played an important role, but during the war a large part of its library&#x27;s books were destroyed when Greek warriors used their paper in the 14 gunpowder mills that worked day and night, supplying them with gunpowder. For this reason Dimitsana has been called &quot;the Nation&#x27;s powder keg&quot;.

In 1960 Dimitsana&#x27;s population was about 2,000, but a lot of people have since then emigrated to the United States, Australia and elsewhere.

==Sights==
Dimitsana is a stone-built village with remarkable mansions, most of which are now restored. It is a typical sample of Gortynia&#x27;s architecture and it is registered as a traditional one. The statue of Patriarch Gregory V dominates in the central square and also the family houses of both him and Germanos III of Old Patras can be seen.

Today, Dimitsana&#x27;s Library contains about 35,000 books, manuscripts and documents. In Dimitsana&#x27;s Museum, housed in the Library, there are collections of weaving, looms and handicrafts and an archaeological one. The Elementary School was built from 1898 to 1910, by a donation of Andreas Syngros, and is a characteristic sample of that period. It operated as a girls&#x27; school until 1930 and later as a county court.

Not far from the village is the Open-air Water Power Museum (1997), created by restoring abandoned pre-industrial facilities, based on Water Power. It includes a flour mill, a traditional cauldron, a tannery, a tanner&#x27;s house and a gunpowder mill.


In the surroundings important sights include the Old and the New Philosophou Monastery and Prodromou Monastery, both located inside Loussios&#x27;s gorge.

<text>Briggs is a lunar impact crater that is located in the western part of the Oceanus Procellarum, to the east of the large walled plain Struve. It lies to the northeast of the walled plain Eddington, and north-northwest of the crater Seleucus. The isolated position of this crater on the mare, near the northwestern limb of the Moon, makes it relatively easy for an Earth-bound observer to locate. The crater is named after the English mathematician Henry Briggs.

The outer rim of Briggs is not quite circular, with outward bulges to the north-northeast and southward. At the midpoint of the crater floor is a central ridge, extending to the north.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Briggs.

<text>All Request Live is the fourth live album by the American rock band Ween, and the third to be released on their home record label Chocodog Records. The performance was webcast on July 22, 2003 and released on November 22, 2003. A Pitchfork Media review calls it &quot;unquestionably the brownest live Ween of them all.&quot;

&quot;All Request Live&quot; features tracks performed live as part of a web radio broadcast, playing songs selected by fans on the band&#x27;s message board. Among the tracks performed are all three officially released parts of &quot;The Stallion&quot; (along with the previously unreleased part four, and part five, from &quot;Craters of the Sac&quot;), fan favorites &quot;Awesome Sound&quot; and &quot;Demon Sweat&quot;, a slightly expanded version of the drug-addled skit &quot;Pollo Asado&quot;, and a nearly six-minute-long take on the band&#x27;s rejected Pizza Hut jingle, &quot;Where&#x27;d the Cheese Go?&quot;

<text>Rhizanthella slateri, commonly known as the eastern underground orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family and is endemic to New South Wales. It is a mycoheterotrophic herb that spends most of its life under the soil surface, its flowers only sometimes appearing a few millimetres about ground level.

==Description==
&quot;Rhizanthella slateri&quot; is a leafless, sympodial herb with a branching, whitish, underground stem up to long and about in diameter with prominent overlapping bracts. The stem is often branched with up to four flowering heads. The heads are up to in diameter and have up to thirty tube-shaped, purplish flowers surrounded by whitish, triangular floral bracts up to long. The sepal is curved with a thread-like tip and has a broad base that forms a hood over the column and the sepals, sometimes protruding above the floral bracts. The petals are about half as long as the lateral sepals. The labellum is thick, tongue-like, heart-shaped and covered with fine, pimply papillae. The column is short and broad with narrow &quot;wings&quot;. Flowering occurs in October and November with the heads maturing below the soil surface or up to above ground level.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The eastern underground orchid was first formally described in 1932 by Herman Rupp and given the name &quot;Cryptanthemis slateri&quot; in &quot;Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales&quot; from specimens collected near Bulahdelah in 1931. In 1985, Mark Clements and Phillip Cribb changed the name to &quot;Rhizanthella slateri&quot;. The specific epithet (&quot;slateri&quot;) honours Ernest William Slater who discovered the species.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Rhizanthella slateri&quot; grows in forest, usually under a deep layer of organic litter. It is known from populations in the Buladelah area, the Watagan Mountains, Blue Mountains, Dharug National Park and near Nowra, each population only known from a few individuals. Records from the Lamington Plateau in Queensland are now recognised as &quot;R. omissa&quot;.

==Conservation status==
This underground orchid is listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Australian Government &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; and as &quot;vulnerable&quot; under the New South Wales Government &quot;Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016&quot;. The Bulahdelah population in the Great Lakes Local Government Area is listed as &quot;endangered&quot;. That population was threatened by the building of a new highway, but a small diversion saved some individuals and some were able to be relocated.

<doc id="1124384" wikidata="Q115734" url="?curid=1124384" title="Desargues (crater)">
<text>Desargues is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located near the northern limb of the Moon, on the western hemisphere. It lies nearly due south of the crater Pascal, and southeast of Brianchon. The proximity of this crater to the limb means that it appears highly elongated due to foreshortening, and it is difficult to discern details from the Earth.

This formation has been significantly eroded and degraded with the passage of time, leaving a low, irregular rim that has been reshaped by subsequent impacts. The rim has a notable bulge to the northeast, and a lesser bulge along the southern rim. The later remains as an imprint of a ghost crater in the surface that overlies the southern rim, and leaves a remnant of its northern rim in the crater floor.

The bulge to the northeast has left a remnant of its origin in the crater floor, as a series of low hills extending from the north and southeast. These enclose the northeastern third of the floor, and are suggestive of an overlapping crater formation. This crater is overlain in turn by a pair of craters that lie across the eastern rim.

The floor of the crater is level and has most likely been resurfaced by subsequent lava flows, or by fallback and ejecta deposits. This wiped away much of the original structure of the interior, leaving ridges and traces where once lay crater rims. Other lesser craters intrude into the rim, with Desargues M forming a bulge into the southern rim and Desargues A overlying the northern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Desargues.

<text>Joseph Clement (13 June 1779 – 28 February 1844) was a British engineer and industrialist, chiefly remembered as the maker of Charles Babbage&#x27;s first difference engine, between 1824 and 1833.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Joseph Clement was born on 13 June 1779 at Great Asby in Westmorland, the son of a hand-loom weaver. Although he was taught to read and write at the local school, he learned mechanics and natural history from his father, Thomas, who had built himself a lathe. He worked, first as a weaver, then as a slater, and learned metalwork from the local blacksmith. With these skills, he built himself his own lathe, on which he turned woodwind musical instruments, which he then learned to play.

By 1805 he was making looms at a factory in Kirkby Stephen, then moved first to Carlisle, then to Glasgow where he learned draughtsmanship from Peter Nicholson. By 1812 he was with Leys, Masson &amp; Co. in Aberdeen, where he attended lectures in natural philosophy at Marischal College.

==Career==
In 1813, he moved to London, first working for Alexander Galloway in Holborn. He soon left in search of wages more suiting his skills, moving to Joseph Bramah at Pimlico. Bramah doubled the wages Galloway had paid and entered into a formal agreement with Clement for a term of five years, dated 1 April 1814, making him chief draughtsman and superintendent of Bramah&#x27;s Pimlico works.

Following Bramah&#x27;s death, Clement took up a position as chief draughtsman at Maudslay, Sons and Field, in Lambeth, where he played a role in the design of the firm&#x27;s early marine steam engines.

In 1817 he left Maudslay and Field to set up his own firm, encouraged by the Duke of Northumberland, a frequent visitor to Maudslay&#x27;s works. Clement had managed to save the sum of £500 and took a small workshop at 21 Prospect Place, Newington, where he set up in business as a draughtsman and manufacturer of precision machinery.

In 1818 he was awarded the gold medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts for his invention of a machine for marking ellipses, inspired by the trammels used by carpenters.

Clement&#x27;s main interest was the improvement of self-acting machine tools, and especially lathes. He introduced various improvements in the construction of lathes, being awarded the gold Isis medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts in 1827 for his improved lathe which was of unprecedented precision and accuracy. The next year he added his self-adjusting centre chuck to the lathe, for which the Society of Arts awarded him their silver medal.

The same year (1828), Clement began making fluted screw-cutting tap and dies and urged the adoption of a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular diameter should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each diameter of bolt. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement&#x27;s journeymen afterwards played a major role in such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.

Regarding Clement&#x27;s building of planers, Roe (1916) says,

:Clement made his first planer in 1820 […]. Some years later he built his &quot;great planer,&quot; a remarkable machine from both a mechanical and a financial standpoint. A very full description of it was given by Mr. Varley in the &quot;Transactions of the Society of Arts&quot; in London in 1832, illustrated by a set of copper plates made from Clement&#x27;s own drawings. Clement&#x27;s reputation of being the most expert draftsman of his day is well borne out by these drawings. […] It was fitted with centers and was used for planing circular, spiral and conical work as well as flat work. It took in work 6 feet square and was hand-driven. […] For more than ten years it was the only one of its size and it ran for many years night and day on jobbing work, its earnings forming Clement&#x27;s principal income.

===Involvement with Charles Babbage===
The recognised excellence of Clement&#x27;s machine tools and his skill in precision engineering led to him being employed by Charles Babbage in 1823 to work on his project to design and build his mechanical calculating device, the difference engine. The high prices of his large precision tools led to a falling out with Babbage (at the time workmen were allowed to keep any tools made by them in the course of their work), but his skill and the quality of his products kept him in employment for many years.

===Later years===
In later years, Clement returned to music and constructed an organ. He died on 28 February 1844 at 31 St George&#x27;s Road, Southwark. Although he had never married, he had a daughter, Sarah Clement, by one Agnes Esson from County Durham.

<text>The Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991 is the derecho event that occurred on July 7 and 8, 1991. It lasted 17 hours and raced from southeast South Dakota through southern Michigan before dying out over Western Pennsylvania.

==South Dakota==
This derecho started in southeastern South Dakota at around 8 A.M. CDT.

==Iowa==
The derecho moved into northern Iowa causing more damage. Thousands of acres of corn and soybean crops were flattened causing $60 million in damage (1991 dollars).The strongest wind gust—103 mph (170 km/h) -- was recorded at Sioux Center, Iowa. A school&#x27;s roof was blown off in Orange City.

A gust of 71 mph was recorded at Mason City airport. There was also major damage inside the city. A woman was killed in McIntosh Woods State Park when a tree fell on her.

==Wisconsin==
As this derecho moved into Wisconsin in the early afternoon hours, it died out and a new derecho quickly developed. The derecho quickly gained in size and was once again causing damage. Thirty farm buildings were destroyed and over 250 were damaged over southern Wisconsin. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, a 300-year-old Dunbar Oak tree was toppled. Dane, Jefferson, Waukesha, Washington, and Ozaukee counties were declared Federal Disaster Areas by FEMA.

==Southern Michigan==
The derecho entered southern Michigan at around 6:30 P.M. EDT. It would move at up to 60 mph, and knock out power to nearly 853,000 customers. Up to this time this would be the largest number of customers in Michigan to lose power from the same storm system. For some customers it would take up to a week for the power to be restored.

An 84 mph (133 km/h) wind gust was reported at Grand Rapids, Michigan and at Belding, Michigan. A semi-trailer was blown over on I-69 near Marshall.

Also, an F1 tornado touched down in Rochester, Michigan.

==Southwestern Ontario==
After crossing lower Michigan, the derecho moved into the Windsor area of Ontario around 9:30pm EDT. Many electrical lines were blown down and a number of roofs were damaged. A tornado touched down near Stratford and numerous funnel clouds were reported.

==Demise==
The bow echo system then crossed over Lake Erie and dissipated over Western Pennsylvania (including metro Pittsburgh) at around 2 A.M. EDT on July 8.

The Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991 traveled about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) in 17 hours, caused $100 million in damage (1991 dollars), cut off electrical power to nearly 1 million customers, killed 1 and injured about 12 others.

<doc id="1124406" wikidata="Q338553" url="?curid=1124406" title="The Visitors (ABBA album)">
<text>The Visitors is the eighth studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was released on 30 November 1981.

With &quot;The Visitors&quot;, ABBA took several steps away from the &quot;lighter&quot; pop music they had recorded previously and the album is often regarded as a more complex and mature effort. The opening track, &quot;The Visitors&quot;, with its ominous synthesizer sounds and the distinctive lead vocal by Frida, announced a change in musical style. With Benny and Frida going their separate ways, the pain of splitting up was explored yet again in &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot;. The major hit single on the album, &quot;One of Us&quot;, also depicted the end of a love story. Elsewhere there were Cold War themes—highly topical at the time—and further songs of isolation and regret.

&quot;The Visitors&quot; was one of the first records ever to be digitally recorded and mixed, as well as one of the earliest in history to be pressed on the CD format in 1983. &quot;The Visitors&quot; has been reissued in digitally remastered form four times—first in 1997, then in 2001, again in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set and most recently in 2012, as part of the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; series.

For four decades, &quot;The Visitors&quot; stood as ABBA&#x27;s last studio album, until the release of their 2021 album, &quot;Voyage&quot;.

==Recording and release==
Recording began on what was to become ABBA&#x27;s eighth studio album on March 16, 1981. By this time, tensions in ABBA had heightened. Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog had divorced in July 1980, while the band&#x27;s other couple, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, announced their divorce in February 1981, adding strain to the musical partnership. Ulvaeus mentioned in retrospect that the sessions were troubled, noting, &quot;It could be frosty sometimes.&quot; Lyngstad also commented that they were beginning to tire of working together.

The members of ABBA and their personnel have memories of the recording sessions for this album being rather difficult. To begin with, their sound engineer Michael Tretow had to become accustomed to using the new 32-track digital recorder that had been purchased for Polar Music Studios. He said, &quot;Digital recording...cut out all the hiss, but it also meant that sounds were sharply cut off below a certain level. The sound simply became too clean, so I had to find ways of compensating for that&quot;. The first three tracks for the album had already been recorded using analogue tape and therefore Tretow had to transfer all subsequent tracks from digital to analogue and back again to avoid a difference in quality.
On its release, &quot;The Visitors&quot; reached the top of the charts in a number of territories but was not as successful as the band&#x27;s previous albums.

On 1 December 2023, &quot;The Visitors&quot; was reissued as a multi-format release for its delayed 40th anniversary celebration. It included: a double-LP half-speed mastered version of the album, done by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios, pressed on 45rpm 180g black vinyl; a colored vinyl 7&quot; singles box set of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, &quot;One of Us&quot;, &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;, and &quot;Under Attack&quot; (the latter two being from &quot;The Singles: The First Ten Years&quot;); and individual 7&quot; picture discs of these four singles.

== Deluxe edition ==
&quot;The Visitors&quot; was reissued on 23 April 2012, as a CD an DVD deluxe edition set. The first disc consisted of a remastered version of the original album, with seven bonus tracks. Featured among them were: a version of &quot;Should I Laugh or Cry&quot; with a brief count-in, from the original United Kingdom and South African 7&quot; release; &quot;I Am the City&quot;, recorded in 1982 and released in 1993, on &quot;More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits&quot;; and, particularly, the 9-minute demo medley &quot;From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel&quot;. This collection of demos, put together by Benny Andersson, showcased the evolution of &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;, offered insights into ABBA&#x27;s recording process, and was, at the time, the first release of unheard archive material since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; box set. 

The second disc included the following television material: the performances of &quot;Two for the Price of One&quot; and &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot; from the &quot;Dick Cavett Meets ABBA&quot; special; the original promo clip of &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot;; two promotional appearances by the band, from &quot;The Late, Late Breakfast Show&quot; (BBC) and &quot;Nöjesmaskinen&quot; (SVT), titled &quot;ABBA In London, November 1982&quot; and &quot;ABBA In Stockholm, November 1982&quot;, respectively; four television commercials: two for &quot;The Visitors&quot; and two for &quot;The Singles: The First Ten Years&quot;; and the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot;. The set also came with a 24-page booklet with an essay on the making of the album.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewed this deluxe reissue on 18 May 2012, and gave it an 8.6 rating, saying &quot;even as the band&#x27;s commercial star faded and its professional relationships quietly unravelled, they were perfectionists. ABBA&#x27;s music on &quot;The Visitors&quot; is more pristine and ambitious than it had ever been, its themes darker, its personal politics more tangled&quot;. An April 2012 review by &quot;The Arts Desk&quot; said that &quot;&quot;The Visitors&quot; is not their best, but it is their most interesting [album], pointing to where Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson would go next&quot;.

== Album cover ==

Rune Söderqvist, who had worked with the band on previous designs, was put in charge of the artwork, and came up with an &quot;angel&quot; concept that was based on the album&#x27;s titled and its closing track &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;. The next step was to develop this concept into an idea. As he recalled, &quot;I knew that the painter Julius Kronberg had painted a lot of angels in his time... so I located his studio – at the Skansen park [in Stockholm] – which contained several of his paintings&quot;. With photographer Lasse Larsson&#x27;s help, Söderqvist gathered the band in Krongberg&#x27;s atelier (in a room with paintings of Eros) and photographed them with a giant painting of an angel as the backdrop. 

In the album cover, the group members are positioned apart and appear to be waiting solemnly in the shadows. It was the first time the members were depicted as separate individuals rather than a close-knit group, conveying ABBA&#x27;s general sense of fatigue.

Julius Kronberg&#x27;s Atelje (atelier), where the album cover&#x27;s photo-shoot took place, is located in Skansen Park, Stockholm.

==Track listing==
All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.


=== Deluxe edition ===
Released on 12 April 2012. The tracks &quot;No hay a quien culpar&quot; and &quot;Se me está escapando&quot; (the Spanish versions of &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot; and &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot;, respectively), featured on the Spanish and Latin American versions of the album, were not included on this reissue. Instead, they could be found on &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; and the 2014 deluxe edition of &quot;Gracias Por La Música&quot;.

All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

<text>Karrer is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the northeast of the crater Minkowski, and south of Leavitt.

The most notable feature of this crater is the dark-hued floor, created when the interior was resurfaced by lava flows that had a lower albedo than the surrounding terrain. The outer rim is nearly circular, but broken in the northeast by a smaller overlapping crater. The inner wall has the same albedo as the surrounding terrain, and marks the perimeter of the flooded floor. The rim is somewhat worn, particularly in the north next to the overlapping crater. On the floor is a lobate scarp that was formed as a result of contraction of the lava. The scarp extends southward across the middle of the crater, past the rim and onto the surrounding highlands.

<doc id="1124428" wikidata="Q501694" url="?curid=1124428" title="Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis">
<text>Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the nervous system which prevents the feeling of pain or temperature and prevents a person from sweating. Cognitive disorders are commonly coincidental. CIPA is the fourth type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), and is also known as HSAN IV.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of CIPA are present from infancy. Infants may present with seizures related to an abnormally high body temperature. Since people with this condition are unable to sweat, they are unable to properly regulate their body temperature. Those affected are unable to feel pain and temperature.

The absence of pain experienced by people with CIPA puts them at high risk for accidental self-injury. Corneal ulceration occurs due to a lack of protective impulses. Joint and bone problems are common due to repeated injuries, and wounds heal poorly.

Delayed developmental milestones in early years may be observed.
Patients often have severe learning difficulties, irritability, hyperactivity, self-injurious behaviour, and cognitive impairment, but patients with normal intelligence have also been reported.

==Cause==
CIPA is caused by a genetic mutation that prevents the formation of nerve cells responsible for transmitting signals of pain, heat, and cold in the brain.
The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

CIPA is caused by a mutation in NTRK1, a gene encoding the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor. NTRK1 is a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). This protein induces outgrowth of axons and dendrites and promotes the survival of embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons. The mutation in NTRK1 does not allow NGF to bind properly, causing defects in the development and function of nociceptive reception.

Mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle cells have been found in people with CIPA. Skin biopsies show a lack of innervation of the eccrine glands and nerve biopsies show a lack of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria, supported by nerve biopsy findings of reduced unmyelinated and small myelinated fibres, and can be confirmed with genetic testing.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The absence of or significantly reduced sweating in CIPA patients can be used for a differential diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
There is no treatment for CIPA. Attention to injuries to prevent infection and worsening is necessary.
=== Anaesthetic management ===
Some patients with CIPA have been operated on without anesthesia, but the patient&#x27;s anxiety might still need to be alleviated in these cases.

Patients might have tactile hyperesthesia, in which case anesthesia is necessary.

Bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperthermia also require management/attention, before, during, and after surgery.

== Epidemiology ==
Worldwide several hundred cases have been reported, but the exact prevalence is unknown.

The condition is inherited and is most common among Negev Arabs aka Negev Bedouins. 
For Japan, the prevalence is estimated at 1/600,000–950,000.

Approximately 20% of people with CIPA die of hyperthermia by age 3.

<text>Bear Lake State Park (sometimes called North Beach State Park) is a public recreation area bordering the north and eastern shores of Bear Lake in the southeast corner of Bear Lake County, Idaho, near the Utah and Wyoming state lines. The state park sits across the lake from St. Charles and is south of Montpelier. Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the park&#x27;s north unit.

==History==
The state purchased land for the park in 1969 using funds supplied through the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. At the same time, the North Beach unit was leased from Utah Power and Light. Management of the north unit continues under lease from PacifiCorp.

==Wildlife==
This state park is home to Bonneville cisco, cutthroat trout, moose, pelicans, lake trout, deer, cranes and cougar.

==Features==
Bear Lake owes its turquoise blue color to the presence of suspended calcium carbonate (limestone). The park&#x27;s two units each have a beach over in length with gradually sloping lake bottom and large swimming area. Camping is offered in the east unit. In winter, the park provides ice fishing access for the annual runs of Bonneville cisco.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bear Lake State Park has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Bear Lake State Park was on July 27–28, 1931, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 1, 1985.

<text>Main is a lunar impact crater that is located near the north pole of the Moon. The southern rim of this formation has merged with the larger crater Challis to the south, and the level interior floor connects the two craters through a narrower gap. To the north-northwest of Main is Gioja.

This formation consists of three overlapping craters that were joined together when the interior floor was resurfaced by lava flows, leaving a generally circular formation with outward bulges to the west and northeast. The same lava has joined the floor of Main with Challis to the south.

The surviving rim of Main is a low slope that is nearly level with the surrounding terrain at its top. There is a small crater lying across the eastern rim that is roughly bowl-shaped and missing its western rim. The floor of Main is nearly level, and marked by a number of tiny craterlets that lie nearly in a band across the floor from the southwest towards the northeast. There is no central peak within the crater, and no other hills of note.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Main.

<doc id="1124449" wikidata="Q17107709" url="?curid=1124449" title="New York State Labor Day derechos">
<text>The New York State Labor Day derechos were two derecho events that occurred on Labor Day, September 7, 1998. One derecho moved through northern and central New York state, and the other would start in southeastern Michigan and move through northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Long Island. A spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office, estimated that 300,000 residences had lost electricity, 7 people died and 80 were injured.

==Syracuse Labor Day derecho==

The northernmost derecho (dubbed the Syracuse Labor Day Derecho and referred to locally as the Labor Day Storm), got its start in northwestern New York just before midnight on September 7 after several thunderstorm cells coming from Ontario converged to become a bow echo. It quickly moved southeastward through New York.

=== Impacts ===

Some of the worst damage occurred at Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica. Three people were killed, two of them at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse. Governor George Pataki declared nine counties in that region to be in a state of emergency, which meant that the state would provide financial and other resources to those counties if help was requested.

An wind gust was recorded at the Greater Rochester International Airport and a gust was recorded at Syracuse Hancock International Airport. 
Winds peaked at an estimated by radars.

Tens of thousands of trees were blown down. Embedded within this derecho was a supercell thunderstorm, which produced an extensive damage path from the Syracuse area, through the northern suburbs of Albany, and into western Vermont. Lightning with this particular storm was reported by many in its path as extreme, creating twilight conditions in Rochester, and daylight conditions on its rampage down the Mohawk Valley. The constant lightning was striking as many as 10–20 times per second. Damage was estimated at $130 million.

Many in the region were without electricity for over a week. Many people had to go to temporary shelters because of damage to their homes. The St. Lucy Catholic church on the west side of Syracuse had one of their steeples ripped off the building.
==New York City Labor Day derecho==

As the Syracuse Derecho moved into New England, a new derecho started developing in southeastern Michigan at around 4 A.M. EDT and followed a track just to the south of the first one. The derecho raced through northeastern Ohio and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and ended up in New York in the mid-afternoon hours.

=== Impacts ===
Four people were killed and 62 were injured, mainly in the New Jersey and the New York City area, but damage also extended east to Long Island and Southwestern Connecticut. Damage was particularly heavy in Union County, where the towns of Plainfield, Cranford, Clark and Rahway declared a state of emergency, imposed overnight curfews and postponed the opening day of school. Four small tornadoes were spawned by this storm, including an F2 tornado in Lynbrook, New York, that caused 6 injuries and $1 million in damage.

Officials said that some 19,500 customers in the city and Westchester County were without power, roughly 71,500 on Long Island, 77,000 in New Jersey, and 10,000 in southern Connecticut. Thousands of trees were blown down and about 100 boats were overturned. A six-person air-sea rescue team from the Police Department&#x27;s Aviation Unit, based at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn had to respond to numerous emergency calls.

<doc id="1124454" wikidata="Q276416" url="?curid=1124454" title="Prudence Heward">
<text>Prudence Heward (July 2, 1896 – March 19, 1947) was a Canadian figure painter, known for using acidic colour, a sculptural treatment, and giving an intense brooding quality to her subjects. She was a charter member of the Canadian Group of Painters, the Contemporary Arts Society and the Federation of Canadian Artists. Although she did not show her work with the Beaver Hall Group, she was allied with many of its artists in her aesthetic aims and through friendships.

==Biography==
Born Efa Prudence Heward in Montreal, Heward was the sixth of eight children and was educated at private schools. She showed an interest in art at a young age, possibly encouraged by her artistically-inclined mother and sister Dorothy, and started drawing lessons at age twelve at the Art Association of Montreal school with William Brymner and Maurice Cullen.

During World War I, Heward lived in England where her brothers served in the Canadian Army while she served as a volunteer with the Red Cross. Returning to Canada at war&#x27;s end, she continued her painting, studying at the Art Association of Montreal. As a student in the advanced class, in 1924, she won the Women&#x27;s Art Society Prize for painting and her work was given its first public showing at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in Toronto, Ontario. However, it was still an era when women artists were given little credibility and it wasn&#x27;t until 1932 that Heward&#x27;s first solo exhibition came at the W. Scott &amp; Sons Gallery in Montreal. 

Wanting to refine her skills, and drawn to the great gathering of creative genius in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France, between 1925 and 1926 Prudence Heward lived and painted in Paris. While studying at the Académie Colarossi, she frequented Le Dome Café in Montparnasse, the favorite haunt of North American writers and artists and the place where Canadian writer Morley Callaghan came with his friends Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 1929, in Paris, Heward met Ontario painter Isabel McLaughlin with whom she became friends and upon her return to Canada, would join with her and other artists on nature painting trips. In the same year 1929 her career got a major boost when her painting, &quot;Girl on a Hill&quot;, won the top prize in the Governor General Willingdon competition organized by the National Gallery of Canada.

She was invited to exhibit with the Group of Seven and through it became friends with A. Y. Jackson with whom she would go on sketching excursions along the Saint Lawrence River. She did a number of landscapes, with a particular attachment for Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships.

She joined the executive committee of &quot;The Atelier: A School of Drawing Painting Sculpture&quot; in 1931. During the Second World War she designed war posters. In 1933, Prudence Heward was a charter member of the Canadian Group of Painters, but her struggle with asthma and other health problems eventually slowed her down. A 1939 automobile accident curtailed her abilities further but she still produced some outstanding portraits until 1945 when her health had deteriorated to the point where she had to give up painting. She died two years later, while seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles, California.

==Work==
Though Heward also painted landscapes and still lifes, she was primarily a painter of human subjects. As Julia Skelly points out in &quot;Prudence Heward: Life &amp; Work&quot;, Heward preferred the term &quot;figures&quot; to portraits, and most of her figurative paintings are of women who often return the viewer&#x27;s gaze, and who are &quot;realistically rendered rather than unrealistically idealized&quot;. These include nude subjects which was sometimes controversial in the 1930s. Art historian Charmaine Nelson has critically examined Heward’s depictions of black women she painted.

Her work was influenced by schools of European modernism and her application of these principles and styles was more than merely formal. They provided her &quot;with a dynamic visual vocabulary for depicting modern Canadian women in both rural and urban contexts&quot;.

Works by Prudence Heward can be found in the collections of several Canadian galleries including the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa and the National Gallery of Canada.

==After her death==
In the year after her death in 1947 a memorial touring exhibition with 102 works was shown at the National Gallery of Canada. In 1996, her cousin, politician Heward Grafftey, wrote &quot;Chapter Four: Prudence Heward&quot; for the book &quot;Portraits of a Life&quot;. &quot;By Woman&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1994), a National Film Board documentary film by Pepita Ferrari, examines her life and that of two fellow painters, Anne Savage and Sarah Robertson.

On July 2, 2010, Canada Post released a commemorative stamp and a souvenir sheet in honour of Heward as part of its Art Canada collection. The two paintings featured were &quot;At the Theatre&quot; (1928) and &quot;Rollande&quot; (1929).
In 2021, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection organized &quot;Uninvited: Canadian Women Artists in the Modern Moment&quot; and included eight of her paintings.

<text>Laura Muntz Lyall (June 18, 1860 – December 9, 1930) was a Canadian Impressionist painter, known for her sympathetic portrayal of women and children.

==Life and work==
Laura Adeline Muntz was born at Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England in 1860, but her family emigrated to Canada when she was a child. She grew up on a farm in the Muskoka District of Ontario. As a young woman, Muntz&#x27;s interest in art led to her take lessons in painting from William Charles Forster of Hamilton and to live and work at his school.

Starting in 1882, she began to take classes at the Ontario School of Art in Toronto where she studied with Lucius Richard O&#x27;Brien, and later with George Agnew Reid. She studied briefly at the South Kensington School of Art in 1887, then returned to Canada to continue her studies with Reid. In 1891, she embarked on a seven-year period of study in Paris, attending the renowned Académie Colarossi. Her preferred subject was children. From 1893 on, her handling of paint was Impressionist.

To stretch her limited financial resources, she gave private English lessons, and shared various apartments in Paris from 1893 to 1897 with another student-teacher at the Académie, the American painter, Wilhelmina Douglas Hawley (1860-1958). Hawley likely taught Muntz her watercolour and pastel technique, and they travelled together in 1893 to Rijsoord in the southern Netherlands where they painted.

Muntz&#x27;s work, exhibited at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois as well as at various French exhibitions such as the Société des Artistes Français, resulted in her paintings being reproduced in periodicals such as &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot;, and reviewed in Toronto`s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, and in England`s &quot;the Studio&quot;, and in many other magazines and newspapers which gave her increased prestige and successful sales. But, in 1895, while she was still in Paris, the unmarried Muntz was called home from a triumphant year abroad to look after an ailing relative. Upon her return, in 1896, the Académie Colarossi, in recognition of her diligence and talent, made her &quot;massière&quot; or studio head.

Muntz decided to return to Canada in 1898 and set up a studio in Toronto to teach and paint. In the decade at the beginning of the new century, she was said to be the artist with the greatest versatility among women painters because she painted such a wide variety of subjects. When, in 1906, she moved to Montreal to continue her career at 6 Beaver Hall Square, she reached a sizable new audience that regarded her as the premier Canadian portraitist of children.

Her work received recognition both in Canada and beyond. She received a silver medal at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition and was awarded a bronze medal at the 1904 Canadian exhibition at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. She showed 27 paintings with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts between 1893 and 1929, and exhibited in yearly exhibitions at many other societies and associations. Her earlier submissions to shows were frequently compared and contrasted with that of her contemporary and friend Florence Carlyle, but in time, her work was applauded in its own right, especially for her sympathetic, lucid manner. Critics recognized that her work looked created by chance, but was the result of years of observation and work, as &quot;Le Canada&quot; wrote in 1903.

She was elected as an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1896, only the eighth woman to receive this honour. Muntz was a member of the Ontario Society of Artists starting in 1891; she was the first woman appointed to its Executive Council in 1899, serving until 1903. In 1909, she was invited to exhibit with the Canadian Art Club: she was the only woman so honoured by this group.

Following the death of her sister in 1915, she returned to Toronto and married her brother-in-law Charles W.B. Lyall to care for the children of her sister&#x27;s marriage (there were 11 of them but only a few remained at home). She then set a studio up in the attic of their home, and started signing her works with her married name. In 1921, she travelled with her husband to Devon, England and there painted what was new scenery for her. Critics praise her handling of light and restrained though rich colour, proof that she could have been a major landscape painter if she chose.

In 1930, Muntz was ill and dying of Exophthalmic Goitre brought on partly by overwork and worry about the family responsibilities she had assumed fifteen years earlier. Despite these trying personal circumstances, she continued to paint until her death in 1930.

==Collections==
Both the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario include her work in their holdings.

==Legacy==
Laura Muntz Lyall is regarded today as an &quot;example of achievement in a male-dominated field and as a champion of womanhood within the confines of an era&quot;. Her work &quot;The Watcher&quot; was included in &quot;150 years 150 works&quot;, an on-line exhibition by Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) as representative of her era. Her painting &quot;A Daffodil&quot; was featured at the National Gallery of Canada in 2021. Her work was on view in the Gallery&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Canada and Impressionism: New Horizons&quot;, which was shown in Ottawa from January to June 2022.

<doc id="1124466" wikidata="Q668593" url="?curid=1124466" title="Uranium–thorium dating">
<text>Uranium–thorium dating, also called thorium-230 dating, uranium-series disequilibrium dating or uranium-series dating, is a radiometric dating technique established in the 1960s which has been used since the 1970s to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral. Unlike other commonly used radiometric dating techniques such as rubidium–strontium or uranium–lead dating, the uranium-thorium technique does not measure accumulation of a stable end-member decay product. Instead, it calculates an age from the degree to which secular equilibrium has been restored between the radioactive isotope thorium-230 and its radioactive parent uranium-234 within a sample.

==Background==
Thorium is not soluble in natural water under conditions found at or near the surface of the earth, so materials grown in or from this water do not usually contain thorium. In contrast, uranium is soluble to some extent in all natural water, so any material that precipitates or is grown from such water also contains trace uranium, typically at levels of between a few parts per billion and few parts per million by weight. As time passes after such material has formed, uranium-234 in the sample with a half-life of 245,000 years decays to thorium-230. Thorium-230 is itself radioactive with a half-life of 75,000 years, so instead of accumulating indefinitely (as for instance is the case for the uranium–lead system), thorium-230 instead approaches secular equilibrium with its radioactive parent uranium-234. At secular equilibrium, the number of thorium-230 decays per year within a sample is equal to the number of thorium-230 produced, which also equals the number of uranium-234 decays per year in the same sample.

==History==
In 1908, John Joly, a professor of geology at Trinity College Dublin, found higher radium contents in deep sediments than in those of the continental shelf, and suspected that detrital sediments scavenged radium out of seawater. Piggot and Urry found in 1942, that radium excess corresponded with an excess of thorium. It took another 20 years until the technique was applied to terrestrial carbonates (speleothems and travertines). In the late 1980s, the method was refined by mass spectrometry, with significant contributions from Larry Edwards. After Viktor Viktorovich Cherdyntsev&#x27;s landmark book about uranium-234 had been translated into English, U-Th dating came to widespread research attention in Western geology.

==Methods==
U-series dating is a family of methods which can be applied to different materials over different time ranges. 
Each method is named after the isotopes measured to obtain the date, mostly a daughter and its parent. Eight methods are
listed in the table below.
The U/U method is based on the fact that U is dissolved preferentially over U because when a U atom decays by emitting an alpha ray the daughter atom is displaced from its normal position in the crystal by atomic recoil.
This produces a Th atom which quickly becomes a U atom. Once the uranium is deposited, the ratio of U to U goes back down to its secular equilibrium (at which the radioactivities of the two are equal), with the distance from equilibrium decreasing by a factor of 2 every 245,000 years.

A material balance gives, for some unknown constant , these expressions for activity rations (assuming that the Th starts at zero):

:formula_1
:formula_2

We can solve the first equation for in terms of the unknown age, :
:formula_3

Putting this into the second equation gives us an equation to be solved for :

:formula_4

Unfortunately there is no closed-form expression for the age, , but it is easily found using equation solving algorithms.

==Dating limits==
Uranium–thorium dating has an upper age limit of somewhat over 500,000 years, defined by the half-life of thorium-230, the precision with which one can measure the thorium-230/uranium-234 ratio in a sample, and the accuracy to which one knows the half-lives of thorium-230 and uranium-234. Using this technique to calculate an age, the ratio of uranium-234 to its parent isotope uranium-238 must also be measured.

==Precision==
U-Th dating yields the most accurate results if applied to precipitated calcium carbonate, that is in stalagmites, travertines, and lacustrine limestones. Bone and shell are less reliable. Mass spectrometry can achieve a precision of ±1%. Conventional alpha counting&#x27;s precision is ±5%. Mass spectrometry also uses smaller samples.

<doc id="1124468" wikidata="Q4393216" url="?curid=1124468" title="Gabrielle Renard">
<text>Gabrielle Renard (August 1, 1878 – February 26, 1959) was a French woman who became an important member of the family of the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, first becoming their nanny, and subsequently a frequent model for the artist. The bond she developed with the Renoirs&#x27; second son, the future filmmaker Jean Renoir, lasted throughout their lives. Upon her marriage in 1921, she became Gabrielle Renard-Slade.

==Early life==
Born in Essoyes in the Aube of France, she was a cousin of Aline Victorine Charigot Renoir, who had married the painter, Pierre-Auguste. The village was the birthplace of Aline also. At age sixteen, Gabrielle Renard moved to Montmartre to live and work as a nanny in her cousin&#x27;s household, where the second of the three Renoir sons was about to be born. Renard became the subject of a number of Renoir&#x27;s portraits, many of her with the children.

==The Renoir family==
Gabrielle Renard developed a strong bond with the infant, Jean Renoir, that would last throughout their lives. She introduced him to the Guignol puppet shows that were held in the Montmartre. Gabrielle was fascinated by the newly invented motion picture, and when Jean Renoir was only a few years old, she took him to see his first film. He became a renowned film maker.

During the final years of Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s life he suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, but continued to paint with her help. When the family moved to a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer near the Mediterranean coast, seeking a better climate for Renoir&#x27;s arthritis, Gabrielle moved with them. While he worked in the studio at &quot;Les Collettes&quot;, Gabrielle would place the paint brush between his crippled fingers.

==Marriage==
Devoted to her cousin&#x27;s family, Gabrielle Renard did not marry until 1921, when the Renoir children were grown. Her husband, (1871–1955), was an aspiring painter from a wealthy American family. They had a son whom they named Jean Slade.

==The United States==
Following the occupation of France by the Germans during World War II, Gabrielle and her family moved to the United States, her husband&#x27;s native country. Jean Renoir also moved to the United States during the war. Being a successful film director, he settled in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. When Gabrielle&#x27;s husband died in 1955, she moved to Beverly Hills to be near Jean Renoir.

==Death==
Gabrielle Renard-Slade died at her home in Beverly Hills in 1959. In his memoirs, &quot;My Life and My Films&quot;, Jean Renoir begins and ends his book with discussion of Gabrielle Renard, and, throughout the autobiography, he recounts the profound influence Gabrielle had upon his life. He wrote, &quot;She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes&quot;, and he concluded with the words he said he had often spoken as a child, &quot;Wait for me, Gabrielle&quot;.

<doc id="1124479" wikidata="Q4944280" url="?curid=1124479" title="Miriam Davenport">
<text>Miriam Davenport or Miriam Davenport Ebel (June 6, 1915 – September 13, 1999) was an American painter and sculptor, She worked with Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee in 1940 helping European Jewish and intellectuals refugees escape from German-occupied France during World War II.

After her return to the United States in late 1941, she worked on cultural issues in primarily academic settings. She also continued to support human rights organizations.

==Personal life and education==
Miriam Davenport was born on June 6, 1915, in Boston, Massachusetts. Her parents were steam boat captain Howard Ernest Davenport and Florence L. (Sparrow) Davenport. In 1920 they lived in Delaware City, Delaware. They also had a son, Howard, who was born about 1926.

In 1930, the family of four lived in New Rochelle, New York. Her father died on April 30, 1936.

Her mother had also died while Davenport was attending Smith College, and the parents had debts. Davenport studied architecture and art history. She graduated in 1937 and studied at New York University&#x27;s Graduate Institute of Fine Arts for one year.

Davenport went to France to attend the Institut d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Archéologie at the Sorbonne in Paris on a Carnegie summer art scholarship. There she fell in love with fellow artist, Rudolph Treo, an exile from Yugoslavia.

==World War II==

With the June 1940 German occupation of France, Davenport fled Paris with Treo. As they traveled south, they split up. In Toulouse, Davenport met poet Walter Mehring and other German and European refugees who were seeking to escape France to go to the United States. The port city of Marseille, although under control of the Vichy Regime, was not yet occupied by the Nazis.

Seeking ways for refugees to leave from there, Davenport met American journalist Varian Fry, who invited her to join his staff at the &quot;Centre Américain de Secours&quot;, or American Relief Center on August 27, 1940. (It also became known as the Emergency Rescue Committee.) She persuaded him to bring on others, including fellow American, Mary Jayne Gold, a wealthy Chicago socialite. Davenport sought out artists and other refugees, interviewed them, and determined who was most in need of help.

With Gold and Theodora Bénédite, Davenport rented the Villa Air-Bel in Marseille. They used it as a place to house some of the people they were aiding to escape. She invited her clients Victor Serge and André Breton and their families to move into the immense house. It became a &quot;famous last gathering place&quot; of the Surrealists.

The Gestapo had identified notable people whom they wanted to capture. At enormous risk to themselves, Davenport and the others ran a covert operation helping writers, artists, scientists, and academics, mostly Jews, to escape from France. They arranged for some of these refugees to escape over the mountains to the safety of Spain and neutral Portugal. Others they smuggled aboard freighters sailing to either North Africa or ports in North or South America.

Davenport worked on the effort until October 1940. Fry and Gold were involved for another year, but they had to leave after Fry was arrested by the French in the fall of 1941. In the less than two years that the American Relief Center was able to operate in Marseille, it evacuated more than 2,000 refugees, who came from all over Europe. These included such notable figures as the artist Marc Chagall, Hitler biographer Konrad Heiden, artist Max Ernst, Nobel Prize winner Otto Meyerhof, and writers Hannah Arendt and Franz Werfel. The consulate address was named &quot;Place Varian Fry&quot; in recognition of the lives he saved.

While Davenport was in France, her fiancé, Rudolph Treo, had returned home to Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, where he become seriously ill. Davenport went to Ljubljana in October 1940 to get him and bring him to Marseille. But her visa was not granted and she was unable to return to France. They lived with his parents in Ljubljana until it was annexed to Italy in April 1941. Davenport and Treo were married that month, and they traveled to Switzerland along an Italian-controlled road to obtain a passport for Treo.

They later reached Portugal. On December 12, 1941, just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Davenport and her husband, Professor Rudolph Treo, sailed for the United States from Lisbon on the &quot;SS Excambion.&quot; On her return to the United States, Davenport became involved with the American Council of Learned Societies Committee for the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas. She helped prepare maps and documentation for use by the Allied Forces to help avoid bombing culturally important sites as well as to enable military units on the ground to secure these sites to prevent pillaging.

Over the decade from 1941 to 1951, she was also involved in a number of humanitarian efforts, including the International Rescue Committee, the Progressive Schools Committee for Refugee Children, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

==Post-war life==
Her first marriage didn&#x27;t last and in 1946 Davenport married William L. M. (&quot;Bill&quot;) Burke, a professor of ancient and medieval history at Princeton University. Burke was the Director of the Index of Christian Art there from 1942 to 1951. He had worked with the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) during the war. Davenport worked at Princeton University where she oversaw the office of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists for Albert Einstein.

In 1951 she and her husband moved to Iowa, where he had been offered a professorship at the University of Iowa. After settling there, Davenport began studying and making art again. While working on her graduate degree, she made sculptures and paintings, which she began exhibiting and winning prizes by 1953. Her husband died very suddenly in 1961. To support herself, Davenport taught French and art to children in Riverside, Iowa.

She met archaeologist Charles Ebel who was an ancient history scholar. They married and Davenport pursued further post-graduate studies. In 1973 she earned her Ph.D. in French literature from the University of Iowa. She also worked as an art instructor and taught French language courses at the university.

Dr. Ebel was hired by Central Michigan University to teach history. Davenport did a thesis on Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon, an 18th-century writer.

==&quot;Crossroads Marseilles, 1940&quot;==
Davenport&#x27;s friend Mary Jayne Gold published her memoir titled &quot;Crossroads Marseilles, 1940&quot; (1980), which recounted their efforts during World War II. Varian Fry had died in 1967, but Davenport visited Marseille and was reunited with Gold. After the war, the latter had returned to live permanently on the French Riviera in a villa she had built there.

==Death==
On September 13, 1999, Davenport died in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, of cancer. Her body was returned to Iowa for burial.

<text>Poinsot is a worn lunar impact crater that is located at the northern part of the Moon on the far side. It lies to the south of the walled plain Rozhdestvenskiy. To the south is the smaller crater Heymans.

This formation has been heavily worn by subsequent impacts, leaving a round-shouldered outer rim that is nearly even with the surrounding terrain and an inner surface that slopes down to the floor without s or horizontal features. A number of tiny craterlets lie along the rim edge and inner walls, as well as across the level interior surface. The floor lacks a central peak at the midpoint, but has a small but notable crater lying next to the western inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Poinsot.

<text>Anne (Annie) Douglas Savage (July 27, 1896 – March 25, 1971) was a Canadian painter and art teacher known for her lyrical, rhythmic landscapes. She was a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters.

==Early life==
Savage was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the daughter of John Savage, a wealthy industrialist. She grew up in what was then the rural area of Dorval, Quebec, and spent her summers at the family cottage in the Laurentian Mountains, where she developed a love of her surroundings that became a source of inspiration for her art. She studied at the High School of Montreal.

==Artistic career==

Between 1914 and 1918, Savage studied art at the Art Association of Montreal under several instructors including William Brymner (1855–1925) and Maurice Cullen. Her private world was permanently changed when her beloved twin brother was killed in action in France during World War I. After the end of the war, Savage went to Minneapolis, Minnesota where she studied design at the Minneapolis School of Art. On her return to Montreal, she took a job as an art teacher at Baron Byng High School where she would remain for 26 years (1922-1947). In addition, she taught art courses to children, promoting their early exposure to the field and years later was able to see the formation of the Child Art Council in Quebec, later known as the Quebec Society for Education through Art.

In 1921, Savage joined the Beaver Hall Hill Group whose painters were closely allied to the Group of Seven. A. Y. Jackson, a member of the Group of Seven would become Savage&#x27;s lifelong close friend. After spending some time at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto with the painter Arthur Lismer, another member of the Group of Seven, Savage traveled to Europe where some of her works were exhibited. Savage also spent time in British Columbia and did sketches of native villages on the northwest coast; this work was displayed in 1927 at the National Gallery in the exhibition &quot;Canadian West Coast Art, Native and Modern&quot;. In 1933, she was one of the founding members of the Canadian Group of Painters and in 1949 and 1960 would serve as its president. She was appointed supervisor of art for the Protestant School Board of Montreal in 1948. She was instrumental in the founding of the High School Art Teaching Association and in 1955 inspired the formation of the Child Art Council which became the Quebec Society for Education through Art.

Savage retired from full-time teaching in 1953 and was named the Supervisor of Art for the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal. She was then invited by McGill University to teach, where she ended up teaching between 1954 and 1959.

Throughout her life, Savage was involved with women&#x27;s rights and gender inequity. Among the groups she joined was the League for Women&#x27;s Rights, Montreal&#x27;s suffrage organization. Curiously, in a speech in 1942, she said that she felt that women artists no longer faced gender inequality. They were equal to men except for housekeeping. Yet, as Kristina Huneault, the author of this article, points out, housekeeping is no minor matter because it takes time and energy away from art-making and reinforces the perception that women&#x27;s place was in the home.

==Death==
Savage died in Montreal in 1971 and was interred there in the Mount Royal Cemetery.

The Anne Savage Archives can be found at Montreal&#x27;s Concordia University.

<text>Borda is a lunar impact crater that lies between Santbech to the north-northwest and Reichenbach slightly further away to the south-southeast. It was named after French astronomer Jean-Charles de Borda. It has a low rim that is broken along the southeast by a smaller crater. The rim is intruded into by another small crater along the southwest side, and there is an irregular cleft along the northwest face. There is a central peak at the midpoint of the floor.

<doc id="1124493" wikidata="Q6821766" url="?curid=1124493" title="Message discipline">
<text>Message discipline is the concept that politicians and other public policy advocates should talk about what is relevant to achieve their aims, and not allow themselves to be sidetracked either by their own thoughts or the questions of press or audience.

When a politician repeats the same thing &quot;ad nauseam&quot;, or uses a question on one subject as a launching point to talk about a different subject, he or she is said to be exercising message discipline. Message discipline may involve subordination of irrelevant personal opinions, or subordination of fluctuating desires to say what others want to hear versus maintaining an unwavering devotion to the message as it reaches out to greater numbers of potential audience members.

Message discipline is often practiced around wedge issues. Devolving to talking points (practicing message discipline) around issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion rights can be a powerful weapon in the politician&#x27;s arsenal, either clouding a difficult line of questioning from an interviewer, or motivating the candidates&#x27; base to vote. Key to defining wedge issues and practicing message discipline are the selection of terms that low-information voters will rally around.

In a business context, message discipline is the practice of reducing and managing the number of messages going from headquarters and marketing functions to field organizations as well as front-line employees. This goal-oriented, structured, strategic communication can lead to operational success, as it reduces the clutter and mixed messages that sometimes afflict communications through organizational layers.

Message discipline is criticised by educated voters who see it as a method of obfuscation from what the electorate sees as important. Overly simplistic and repeated communications of the message are seen as dumbing down and can meet with the cynicism of the electorate.

<text>Léon Ernest Gaumont (; 10 May 1864 – 10 August 1946) was a French inventor, engineer, and industrialist who was a pioneer of the motion picture industry. He founded the world&#x27;s oldest operating film studio, Gaumont, and worked in partnership with Solax Studios.

==Biography==
Léon Ernest Gaumont, born in Paris was gifted with a mechanical mind which led him to employment manufacturing precision instruments. From early childhood, he was fascinated by the technique of photography. When he was offered a job at the Comptoir géneral de photographie in 1893, he jumped at the opportunity. His decision proved fortunate when two years later he was given the chance to acquire the business. In August 1895, he partnered with the astronomer Joseph Vallot, the famous engineer Gustave Eiffel, and the financier Alfred Besnier to make the purchase. Their business entity, called L. Gaumont et Cie, has survived in one form or another to become the world&#x27;s oldest surviving film company extant. The company logo was the distinctive &quot;Marguerite&quot; (named after his mother), a type of flower similar to the daisy. The company had extensive studios (Cité Elgé) in the Buttes-Chaumont District of Paris, and a smaller operation in Nice, France.

Leon Gaumont was married to Camille Louise Maillard (1860-1933) on 4 June 1888. They had five children: Charles, Jeanne, Raymond, Helene, and Louis.

Léon Gaumont&#x27;s company sold camera equipment and film, but in 1897 inaugurated a motion picture production business. Initially, Gaumont made films for the picture arcade business such as those operated by the Lumière brothers, but it was under the direction of Alice Guy (Gaumont&#x27;s secretary - First Woman Film Director), that they began making short films based on narrative scripts. Louis Feuillade (&quot;Judex&quot;, &quot;Les Vampires&quot;, &quot;Fantômas&quot;) was to follow as the Studio Director when Guy left for Fort, Lee, New Jersey in 1912, where she subsequently opened her own production company—Solax Studios— and it was then that Gaumont rapidly expanded the business into cinematographic equipment for amateurs. Within a few years, Gaumont&#x27;s company ranked second only to Pathé Frères in the field of French Cinema. In 1903, Gaumont was granted patents for his Chronophonographe and loudspeaker system designed to work with his sound-on-disc talking pictures: the chronophone. The &quot;Etablissements Gaumont&quot; was founded in 1906 to handle film production and distribution, plus to operate a chain of movie theaters, including the giant Gaumont Palace (1912) (Place Clichy - former &quot;Hippodrome) in Paris (largest in the world at the time - 6,000 seats). By 1910 Léon Gaumont had improved his synchronous sound invention to the point where he was able to provide enough volume to be heard by up to 4000 people in a theater. In 1912, Gaumont developed a color process for film.

As one of the two dominant forces in film in all of Europe (the other being Charles Pathé), World War I profoundly affected Leon Gaumont&#x27;s business fortunes. He hired over 300 additional employees, in spite of the fact that Nitrate Emulsion film stocks dwindled because of the need for nitro-cellulose in the munitions industry. Nevertheless, before retiring in 1930, he had built one of the most important film companies in cinema history.

Upon his retirement to Provence, a restructuring of corporate ownership took place through financing provided by the Banque Nationale de Crédit and with a capital stock issue in the name of a new company called Gaumont-Franco-Film-Aubert (GFFA). Four years later, a scandal erupted following the collapse of the Banque Nationale de Crédit and GFFA was forced to file for bankruptcy protection.

==Death and legacy==
Léon Gaumont died on 9 August 1946 in Sainte-Maxime-sur-Mèr, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of France, and was buried in the Cimetière de Belleville in Paris. In 1995, on the 100th anniversary of French film, a commemorative silver 100 Franc coin was issued with Léon Gaumont&#x27;s image.

<text>Webb is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern edge of the Mare Fecunditatis, in the eastern part of the Moon near the equator. It was named after British astronomer Thomas William Webb. It is to the north of the prominent crater Langrenus, and west of Maclaurin.
The interior of Webb is relatively dark compared with the inner walls of the rim, and it has a low hill at the midpoint of the interior. On the lunar mare to the north is a faint marking of a ray system that appears to radiate from this crater. West of the crater is the wrinkle ridge Dorsa Andrusov.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Webb.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Webb R — &quot;See&quot; Condon (crater).

<text>Waiting for My Rocket to Come is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz, released on October 15, 2002, by Elektra Records. It was his only studio release on that label before he moved to Atlantic Records. By December 2003, the album had sold 500,000 copies, prompting &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; to dub Mraz &quot;The winner of 2003’s sensitive singer-songwriter sweepstakes&quot;. The album&#x27;s commercial success occurred partly because of its successful Top 40 single &quot;The Remedy (I Won&#x27;t Worry)&quot;, as well as Mraz&#x27;s energetic live performances and extensive self-promotion.

Mraz said the title was an optimistic title, reflecting the process of playing music while simultaneously preparing for success while waiting for success to arrive.

<text>The 7th Medium Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, was one of six Canadian medium regiments that saw
service in Britain and continental Europe in the Second World War, the others
being the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Medium Regiments.
(There was no 6th Medium.)

The 1st, 2nd and 5th Mediums served in Italy, while the 3rd, 4th,
and 7th were in northwest Europe. Three of these units (1st, 4th, and 7th)
were each equipped with sixteen guns, firing 100-pound shells,
while the other three had guns firing 60-pound shells.

Medium regiments were not part of the artillery component of the individual infantry or armoured divisions as were most field regiments (25-pounder guns) but were classed as &quot;Army&quot; troops and were available to support any formation which needed the fire of heavier guns.

The 7th Medium Regiment was raised in September 1939 with
the mobilization of four Ontario militia field artillery batteries: the 12th
(London), 45th (Lindsay), 97th (Walkerton) and 100th (Listowel).
In the period from then until February 1941, during which time
the regiment was at Petawawa, there were a number of
organizational changes from which emerged the 7th Army
Field Regiment, RCA, consisting of the 12th, 45th and 97th
Batteries.

The 7th continued its training at Petawawa and in New Brunswick until November 1941, when it went overseas to England, where it spent over two and a half years in constant training. A major change occurred in November 1943 when the regiment was converted from Field to Medium, and gave up its 25-pounders for the much bigger 5.5 inch. In the process it became a two-battery regiment, and the 97th Battery was disbanded, most of its personnel, however, being absorbed by the other two larger batteries.

The war for the 7th Medium became the real thing when it crossed the Channel in the second week in July 1944, and from then until the end of the fighting in the first week of May 1945 it took part in all the major battles and actions in which First Canadian Army was engaged: Normandy, the Seine crossing, the Channel ports
(Boulogne and Calais), the Scheldt, Bergen op Zoom, Nijmegen salient,
the Rhineland, the Rhine crossing, the advance through central and northern Netherlands, and finally across the Ems River into northwest Germany.

The 7th Medium fired its first round in anger at Rots, near Caen, Normandy, shortly after 18:00 on 13 July 1944, and its last, also shortly after 18:00, from its last gun position at Veenheusen in Germany, a short distance from Emden, on 4 May 1945. In the course of 10 months in action, the 7th occupied about 60 gun positions, fired nearly 70,000 rounds of 100-pound shells in support of three Canadian divisions, most of the British divisions and the 1st Polish Armoured Division, all of the British 21st Army Group.

The major battles in which the 7th was engaged were of course Normandy, the Scheldt and the Rhineland. The fire program for the opening of the latter is reported to have been the largest in the West during the war: at 05:00 on 8 February 1945, 1,400 British and Canadian guns of all calibres opened fire at once in support of the British XXX Corps, consisting for the opening of the battle of four British divisions and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacking east from Nijmegen into Germany. Included in the preliminary bombardment, which ended at 09:30, were 16 medium regiments (13 Royal Artillery and three Royal Canadian Artillery. This was followed at 10:00 by the 2½-hour barrage in support of XXX Corps infantry attacking into Germany. In the ten months in which the 7th Medium was in action it had 124 casualties, of which 35 were killed and 89 wounded (some of the latter returned to the unit on recovery).

In Normandy, during Operation Totalize, on 8 August 1944, a group of American bombers dropped their ordnance right on top of the 7th medium regiment, 12th battery, Royal Canadian Artillery. &quot;The great problem on our side was road space, and it was while waiting in our gun positions, still firing at the retreating German forces, that the first disaster of the campaign befell us. A flight of American Fortresses flying high over 12th Battery area unloaded their bomb load right on top of the battery and on a nearby ammunition depot. B troop received most of the damage and Lt. J.E. Clark and ten other ranks were killed or died of wounds shortly afterwards. Captain W.G.Ferguson and eighteen other ranks were wounded and evacuated&quot;

Several G.P.O.s from the 7th became &#x27;Air Observation Post&#x27; pilots with No. 665 Squadron RCAF, and No. 666 Squadron RCAF: Lt. A.B. Culver, Lt. R.G. Everett, and Lt. R.A.S. Perley.

The 7th Medium Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, was disbanded on 8 June 1945.

==Music==
&quot;The call to arms : the Canadian army marching song&quot; (1914) by W.J. Bugler, was dedicated to Lieutenant Colonel H.C. Becher, commanding, 7th Regiment Fusiliers, London, Ontario. Chorus: &quot;They will march and fight with a might that&#x27;s right&quot; First line: &quot;British boys who play the war game.&quot;

<doc id="1124560" wikidata="Q423489" url="?curid=1124560" title="Connexin">
<text>Connexins (Cx) (TC# 1.A.24), or gap junction proteins, are structurally related transmembrane proteins that assemble to form vertebrate gap junctions. An entirely different family of proteins, the innexins, forms gap junctions in invertebrates. Each gap junction is composed of two hemichannels, or connexons, which consist of homo- or heterohexameric arrays of connexins, and the connexon in one plasma membrane docks end-to-end with a connexon in the membrane of a closely opposed cell. The hemichannel is made of six connexin subunits, each of which consist of four transmembrane segments. Gap junctions are essential for many physiological processes, such as the coordinated depolarization of cardiac muscle, proper embryonic development, and the conducted response in microvasculature. Connexins also have non-channel dependant functions relating to cytoskeleton and cell migration. For these reasons, mutations in connexin-encoding genes can lead to functional and developmental abnormalities.

==Nomenclature==
Connexins are commonly named according to their molecular weights, e.g. Cx26 is the connexin protein of 26 kDa. A competing nomenclature is the gap junction protein system, where connexins are sorted by their α (GJA) and β (GJB) forms, with additional connexins grouped into the C, D and E groupings, followed by an identifying number, e.g. GJA1 corresponds to Cx43. Following a vote at the Gap Junction Conference (2007) in Elsinore the community agreed to use the GJ nomenclature system for the genes that encode connexins, but wished to retain the connexin nomenclature for the encoded proteins using the weight of the human protein for the numbering of orthologous proteins.

==Structure==

Connexins contain four highly ordered transmembrane segments (TMSs), primarily unstructured C and N cytoplasmic termini, a cytoplasmic loop (CL) and two extra-cellular loops, (EL-1) and (EL-2). Connexins are assembled in groups of six to form hemichannels, or connexons, and two hemichannels then combine to form a gap junction.

The crystal structure of the gap junction channel formed by human Cx26 (also known as GJB2) at 3.5 Å resolution is available. The density map showed the two membrane-spanning hemichannels and the arrangement of the four TMSs of the six protomers forming each hemichannel. The hemichannels feature a positively charged cytoplasmic entrance, a funnel, a negatively charged transmembrane pathway, and an extracellular cavity. The pore is narrowed at the funnel, which is formed by the six amino-terminal helices lining the wall of the channel, which thus determines the molecular size restriction at the channel entrance.

The connexin gene family is diverse, with twenty-one identified members in the sequenced human genome, and twenty in the mouse (nineteen of which are orthologous pairs). They usually weigh between 25 and 60 kDa, and have an average length of 380 amino acids. The various connexins have been observed to combine into both homomeric and heteromeric gap junctions, each of which may exhibit different functional properties including pore conductance, size selectivity, charge selectivity, voltage gating, and chemical gating.

==Biosynthesis and internalization==
A remarkable aspect of connexins is that they have a relatively short half life of only a few hours. The result is the presence of a dynamic cycle by which connexins are synthesized and replaced. It has been suggested that this short life span allows for more finely regulated physiological processes to take place, such as in the myometrium.

===From the nucleus to the membrane===
As they are being translated by ribosomes, connexins are inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is in the ER that connexins are properly folded, yielding two extracellular loops, EL-1 and EL-2. It is also in the ER that the oligomerization of connexin molecules into hemichannels begins, a process which may continue in the UR-Golgi intermediate compartment as well. The arrangements of these hemichannels can be homotypic, heterotypic, and combined heterotypic/heteromeric. After exiting the ER and passing through the ERGIC, the folded connexins will usually enter the &quot;cis&quot;-Golgi network. However, some connexins, such as Cx26 may be transported independent of the Golgi.

===Gap junction assembly===
After being inserted into the plasma membrane of the cell, the hemichannels freely diffuse within the lipid bilayer. Through the aid of specific proteins, mainly cadherins, the hemichannels are able to dock with hemichannels of adjacent cells forming gap junctions. Recent studies have shown the existence of communication between adherens junctions and gap junctions, suggesting a higher level of coordination than previously thought.
==Function==
Connexin gap junctions are found only in vertebrates, while a functionally analogous (but genetically unrelated) group of proteins, the innexins, are responsible for gap junctions in invertebrate species. Innexin orthologs have also been identified in Chordates, but they are no longer capable of forming gap junctions. Instead, the channels formed by these proteins (called pannexins) act as very large transmembrane pores that connect the intra- and extracellular compartments.

Within the CNS, gap junctions provide electrical coupling between progenitor cells, neurons, and glial cells. By using specific connexin knockout mice, studies revealed that cell coupling is essential for visual signaling. In the retina, ambient light levels influence cell coupling provided by gap junction channels, adapting the visual function for various lighting conditions. Cell coupling is governed by several mechanisms, including connexin expression.

Decrock et al.&quot;.&quot; have discussed a multilevel platform via which connexins and pannexins can influence the following cellular functions within a tissue: (1) connexin gap junctional channels (GJCs) enable direct cell-cell communication of small molecules, (2) connexin hemichannels and pannexin channels can contribute to autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways, and (3) different structural domains of these proteins allow for channel-independent functions, such as cell-cell adhesion, interactions with the cytoskeleton, and the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, connexins and pannexins have multifaceted contributions to brain development and specific processes in the neuro-glio-vascular unit, including synaptic transmission and plasticity, glial signaling, vasomotor control, cell movement, and blood-brain barrier integrity in the mature CNS.

===Substrate specificity===
Different connexins may exhibit differing specificities for solutes. For example, adenosine passed about 12-fold better through channels formed by Cx32 while AMP and ADP passed about 8-fold better, and ATP greater than 300-fold better, through channels formed by Cx43. Thus, addition of phosphate to adenosine appears to shift its relative permeability from channels formed by Cx32 to channels formed by Cx43. This may have functional consequence because the energy status of a cell could be controlled via connexin expression and channel formation.

===Transport reaction===
The transport reaction catalyzed by connexin gap junctions is:
:Small molecules (cell 1 cytoplasm) ⇌ small molecules (cell 2 cytoplasm)

==Human connexins and clinical significance==

Gap junctions are essential for many physiological processes, such as the coordinated depolarization of cardiac muscle, proper embryonic development, and the conducted response in microvasculature. For this reason, deletion or mutation of the various connexin isoforms produces distinctive phenotypes and pathologies. While mutations in Cx43 are mostly linked to oculodentodigital dysplasia, Cx47 mutations are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease and lymphedema. Cx40 mutations are principally linked to atrial fibrillation. Mutations in Cx37 have not yet been described, but polymorphisms in the Cx37 gene have been implicated in the development of arterial disease.

<text>Chares of Lindos (; , &quot;gen.:&quot; Χάρητος; before 305 BC – c.280 BC) was a Greek sculptor born on the island of Rhodes. He was a pupil of Lysippos. Chares constructed the Colossus of Rhodes in 282 BC, an enormous bronze statue of the sun god Helios and the patron god of Rhodes. The statue was built to commemorate Rhodes&#x27; victory over the invading Macedonians in 305 BC, led by Demetrius I, son of Antigonus, a general under Alexander the Great.
Also attributed to Chares was a colossal head that was brought to Rome and dedicated by P. Lentulus Spinther on the Capitoline Hill in 57 BC (Pliny, &quot;Natural History&quot; XXXIV.18).

The Colossus of Rhodes is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and was considered Chares&#x27;s greatest accomplishment, until its destruction in an earthquake in 226 BC.

The work may have been completed by Laches, also an inhabitant of Lindos. 

==In popular culture==
* L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bronze God of Rhodes&quot; is written as Chares&#x27; memoirs of the Siege of Rhodes and the building of the Colossus of Rhodes.
* Asteroid 236746 Chareslindos, discovered by Vincenzo Casulli in 2007, was named after the ancient Greek sculptor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 November 2017 ().
* Chares, called by the Italian version of his name (Carete), appears in the 1961 film &quot;The Colossus of Rhodes&quot;, portrayed by Félix Fernández.

<text>The bathtub curve is a particular shape of a failure rate graph. This graph is used in reliability engineering and deterioration modeling. The &#x27;bathtub&#x27; refers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, similar in shape to a bathtub. The bathtub curve has 3 regions:

#The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.
#The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.
#The last region is an increasing failure rate due to wear-out failures.

Not all products exhibit a bathtub curve failure rate. A product is said to follow the bathtub curve if in the early life of a product, the failure rate decreases as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources 
of potential failure such as manufacturing defects or damage during transit are detected. In the mid-life of a product the failure rate is constant. In the later life of the product, the failure rate increases due to wearout. Many electronic consumer product life cycles follow the bathtub curve. It is difficult to know where a product is along the bathtub curve, or even if the bathtub curve is applicable to a certain product without large amounts of products in use and associated failure rate data.

If products are retired early or have decreased usage near their end of life, the product may show fewer failures per unit calendar time (but not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve predicts.

In reliability engineering, the cumulative distribution function corresponding to a bathtub curve may be analysed using a Weibull chart or in a reliability contour map.

<doc id="1124588" wikidata="Q627554" url="?curid=1124588" title="Certificate signing request">
<text>In public key infrastructure (PKI) systems, a certificate signing request (CSR or certification request) is a message sent from an applicant to a certificate authority of the public key infrastructure (PKI) in order to apply for a digital identity certificate. The CSR usually contains the public key for which the certificate should be issued, identifying information (such as a domain name) and a proof of authenticity including integrity protection (e.g., a digital signature). The most common format for CSRs is the [[PKCS]] #10 specification; others include the more capable Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) and the SPKAC (Signed Public Key and Challenge) format generated by some web browsers.

== Procedure ==
Before creating a CSR for an X.509 certificate, the applicant generates a key pair, keeping the private key of that pair secret, e.g.:

 # https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-genrsa.html
# &quot;openssl genrsa&quot; creates an RSA private key:

$ openssl genrsa -out 2024_wikipedia.org.key

The CSR contains information identifying the applicant (such as a distinguished name), the public key chosen by the applicant, and possibly further information. When using the PKCS #10 format, the request must be self-signed using the applicant&#x27;s private key, which provides proof of possession (POP) of the private key but limits the use of this format to keys that can be used for (some form of) signing. 

The CSR must be accompanied by a proof of origin (i.e., proof of identity of the applicant), which is required for security reasons by the certificate authority. The certificate authority may contact the applicant for further information.

Typical information required in a CSR (sample column from sample X.509 certificate). Note that there are often alternatives for the Distinguished Names (DN), the preferred value is listed.

This OpenSSL sample command line uses the details as listed in the table above to create a CSR in PKCS #10 format:

 # https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-req.html
# &quot;openssl req&quot; creates a certificate signing request in PKCS #10 format:

$ openssl req -sha512 -new -subj &quot;/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Wikimedia Foundation, Inc./CN=*.wikipedia.org&quot; -key 2024_wikipedia.org.key -out 2024_wikipedia.org.csr

The CSR is typically sent to a Registration Authority (RA), which checks the CSR contents and authenticates the applicant.
On success the CSR is forwarded to a Certificate Authority (CA), which produces the X.509 public-key certificate, digitally signing it using the CA private key, and sends the new certificate to the applicant.

== Structure of a PKCS #10 CSR ==
A certification request in PKCS #10 format consists of three main parts: the certification request information, a signature algorithm identifier, and a digital signature on the certification request information using the private key related to the public key being certified. 

The signature constitutes a self-signature with the key pair of the applicant.
Due to the self-signature requirement, this format is 
applicable only to types of keys that support signing.
Yet there are variants of this format that do not include an actual
signature, such as described in Appendix C.1 of (CMS).

The first part contains as its most significant information the public key and the identity of the applicant. The self-signature by the applicant provides a proof of possession (POP). Checking the POP prevents an entity from requesting a bogus certificate of someone else&#x27;s public key. Thus the private key is required to produce a PKCS #10 CSR.
Yet note that the POP for the key pair by the subject entity
does not provide any authentication of the subject entity.
The proof of origin for the request by the applicant must therefore be provided and checked by other means.
Otherwise illegitimate certificates can be produced where the subject/holder information is wrong.

CSR for personal ID certificates and signing certificates usually includes the email address of the ID holder or the name of organisation in case of business ID.

The first part, ASN.1 type &quot;CertificationRequestInfo&quot;, consists of a version number (which is 0 for all known versions, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.7 of the specifications), the subject name, the public key (algorithm identifier + bit string), and a collection of attributes providing additional information about the subject of the certificate. The attributes can contain required certificate extensions, a challenge-password to restrict revocations, as well as any additional information about the subject of the certificate, possibly including local or future types.

== Example of a PKCS #10 CSR ==
The PKCS#10 standard defines syntax, semantics, and binary format for CSRs for use with X.509. It is encoded in ASN.1 with DER format. Here is an example of how you can examine its ASN.1 structure using OpenSSL:

 openssl asn1parse -i -in &quot;your_request.p10&quot;

A CSR may be represented as a Base64 encoded PKCS#10; an example of which is
given below:
The above certificate signing request&#x27;s ASN.1 DER structure (as parsed by openssl) appears as the following, where the first number is the byte offset, d=depth, hl=header length of the current type, l=length of content:
This was generated by supplying the base64 encoding into the command codice_1 where PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) is the encoding of the ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding Rules in base64.

<text>Bulk confectionery, pick and mix candy, candy walls, or simply loose candy is a retailing strategy where various types of confectionery are sold together in a large container or in separate bins, allowing customers to select the assortment and quantity they prefer. Typically used in vending machines or confectionery retailers, this method involves dispensing candy by weight or piece count. This method has a global presence, with variations in practice and terminology across regions.

== History ==

=== Sweden ===

Bulk confectionery (Swedish: lösgodis) originates back to the 1930s, when Swedish agriculture began to supply the country with refined sugar and made it possible to sell bulk confectionery in smaller shops. In 1984, the Swedish National Food Agency (&quot;Livsmedelsverket&quot;) approved selling it in ordinary larger stores, given that the candy varieties were kept in separate containers and picked with a scoop or a smaller bucket.

Self-serve loose candy walls were introduced by two Finnish students educated in Stockholm, Sweden. They developed the idea in Helsinki, Finland, in the early 1980s. Since then it has started to spread all around the world, mostly in Europe and Asia. Even some IKEA stores in North America have started to sell mostly Swedish varieties but also American classics.

Swedes ate the most pick and mix candy in the world in 2009. Maundy Thursday is the biggest selling day in grocery stores. In Sweden, about 18 kilograms of candy are consumed per person per year (as of 2014).

=== United States ===
The first penny candy to be sold in the United States was the Tootsie Roll, in 1907, followed by Necco Wafers and Hershey&#x27;s Kisses in subsequent decades. Bulk-sale of candy in the 20th century US was mainly through the F.W. Woolworth Company’s five and dime store chain, which closed in the 1990s, marking an end in popularity of the phenomenon.

<text>Johann Peter Melchior (8 March 1747 – 13 June 1825) was a German porcelain modeller.

Melchior was born in Lintorf. He was interested in art from an early age and was apprenticed to a sculptor in Düsseldorf. He made a name for himself in the porcelain trade and was named &quot;Modellmeister&quot; at the acclaimed Höchst porcelain factory in 1767, a post he held until 1779. He later worked at the factories at Frankenthal (1779–93) and Nymphenburg (1797–1822). He died in Nymphenburg.

Melchior was a transitional figure between Rococo and Neoclassicism. His early work was graceful and often sentimental, and his favourite subjects included religious groups, pastoral scenes, characters from mythology, and children. As his career progressed, his works became less sentimental and more neoclassical.

<text>Danny Devos (born 20 September 1959), also known as DDV, is a Belgian artist whose work involves body art and performance art and a fascination with true crime.

Since 1979 he has done over 160 performances and made several sculptural installations depicting violence, crime and murder. Since 1987 he has been corresponding with serial killers like Freddy Horion and Michel Bellen in Belgium and John Wayne Gacy in the USA.

In 1981 he founded the artist initiative Club Moral with Anne-Mie van Kerckhoven.

From 1998 until 2004 he was Social Commissioner and chairman of the NICC, the first association of Visual Artists in Belgium, where he was in charge of the Social Statute of the Artist.

In 2005 he moved to Beijing in China to develop and manage Art Farm for colleague artist Wim Delvoye.

From 2005 until recently he performed his piece &#x27;Diggin&#x27; for Gordon&#x27;, inspired by Gordon Matta-Clark, at a secret location and can only be seen by the audience through a webcam.

His most recent works are based on artificial intelligence text-to-image model renderings that are then used to produce 3D printing or CNC machined relief objects.

Club Moral is also a pioneer noise music band.

Apart from solo sound concerts, he also performs with Bum Collar, an improvisational noise band with Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven on electronics, Mauro Pawlowski on guitar, and Paul Mennes engineering and browntones.

<text>Victory V is a British brand of liquorice-flavoured lozenges. Originally manufactured in Nelson, Lancashire, they were devised by Thomas Fryer and Edward Smith MD in 1864 and were initially made by hand to ensure that each sweet contained the correct amount of therapeutic ingredients: ether, liquorice and chloroform.

In 1959, a film was produced by Red Rose Films called &quot;The Story of Victory-V&quot;, documenting the production of Victory V lozenges and other products of the Nelson Victory V factory.

In the 1960s they acquired the Alverthorpe firm of A.Talbot and Son. Victory V lozenges are available in specialist shops and online, but no longer contain chloroform or ether. However, their scent and flavour is still vividly reminiscent of diethyl ether - recreated via artificial means to preserve the original flavour. Today they are manufactured by Ernest Jackson &amp; Co. Ltd. in Crediton, Devon.

<doc id="1124636" wikidata="Q707531" url="?curid=1124636" title="Évian Conference">
<text>The Évian Conference was convened 6–15 July 1938 at Évian-les-Bains, France, to address the problem of German and Austrian Jewish refugees wishing to flee persecution by Nazi Germany. It was the initiative of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. Historians have suggested that Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of refugees admitted to the United States.

The conference was attended by representatives from 32 countries, and 24 voluntary organizations also attended as observers, presenting plans either orally or in writing. Golda Meir, the attendee from British Mandatory Palestine, was not permitted to speak or to participate in the proceedings except as an observer. Some 200 international journalists gathered at Évian to observe and report on the meeting. The Soviet Union refused to take part in the conference, though direct talks on resettlement of Jews and Slavs between German and Soviet governments proceeded at the time of the conference and after it. In the end, the Soviet Union refused to accept refugees and a year later ordered its border guards to treat all refugees attempting to cross into Soviet territory as spies.

The conference was ultimately doomed, as aside from the Dominican Republic and later Costa Rica, delegations from the 32 participating nations failed to come to any agreement about accepting the Jewish refugees fleeing the Third Reich. The conference thus inadvertently proved to be a useful tool for the Nazi propaganda. Adolf Hitler responded to the news of the conference by saying that if other nations agreed to take the Jews, he would help them leave.

==Background==

The Nuremberg Laws stripped German Jews, who were already persecuted by the Hitler regime, of their German citizenship. They were classified as &quot;subjects&quot; and became stateless in their own country. By 1938, some 450,000 of about 900,000 German Jews were expelled or fled Germany, mostly to France and British Mandatory Palestine, where the large wave of migrants led to an Arab uprising. When Hitler annexed Austria in March 1938, and applied German racial laws, the 200,000 Jews of Austria became stateless.

Hitler&#x27;s expansion was accompanied by a rise in antisemitism and fascism across Europe. Antisemitic governments came to power in Hungary and Romania, where Jews had always been second-class citizens. The result was millions of Jews attempting to flee Europe, while they were perceived as an undesirable and socially damaging population with popular academic theories arguing that Jews damaged the &quot;racial hygiene&quot; or &quot;eugenics&quot; of nations where they were resident and engaged in conspirative behaviour. In 1936, Chaim Weizmann (who decided not to attend the conference) declared that &quot;the world seemed to be divided into two parts – those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.&quot;

Before the Conference the United States and Britain made a critical agreement: the British promised not to bring up the fact that the United States was not filling its immigration quotas, and any mention of Palestine as a possible destination for Jewish refugees was excluded from the agenda. Britain administered Palestine under the terms of the Mandate for Palestine.

==Proceedings==
Conference delegates expressed sympathy for Jews under Nazism but made no immediate joint resolution or commitment, portraying the conference as a mere beginning, to the frustration of some commentators. Noting &quot;that the involuntary emigration of people in large numbers has become so great that it renders racial and religious problems more acute, increases international unrest, and may hinder seriously the processes of appeasement in international relations&quot;, the Évian Conference established the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees (ICR) with the purpose to &quot;approach the governments of the countries of refuge with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.&quot; The ICR received little authority or support from its member nations and fell into inaction.
The United States sent no government official to the conference. Instead Roosevelt&#x27;s friend, the American businessman Myron C. Taylor, represented the U.S. with James G. McDonald as his advisor. The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000. During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period. The Australian delegate T. W. White noted: &quot;as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one&quot;. The French delegate stated that France had reached &quot;the extreme point of saturation as regards admission of refugees&quot;, a sentiment repeated by most other representatives. The only countries willing to accept a large number of Jews were the Dominican Republic, which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees on generous terms, and later Costa Rica. In 1940 an agreement was signed and Rafael Trujillo donated of his properties near the town of Sosúa, Dominican Republic for settlements. Trujillo, whose racism preferred European Jews over Afro-Caribbeans, did this because he was &quot;desperately anxious to introduce a leavening of white immigration stock . . . Trujillo strongly believed in white superiority.&quot; The first settlers arrived in May 1940: only about 800 settlers came to Sosúa, and most later moved on to the United States.

Disagreements among the numerous Jewish organisations on how to handle the refugee crisis added to the confusion. Concerned that Jewish organisations would be seen trying to promote greater immigration into the United States, executive secretary to the American Jewish Committee, Morris D. Waldman, privately warned against Jewish representatives highlighting the problems Jewish refugees faced. Samuel Rosenman sent President Franklin D. Roosevelt a memorandum stating that an &quot;increase of quotas is wholly inadvisable as it would merely produce a &#x27;Jewish problem&#x27; in the countries increasing the quota.&quot; According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, during the discussions, five leading Jewish organisations sent a joint memorandum discouraging mass Jewish emigration from central Europe. Reacting to the conferences&#x27; failure, the AJC declined to directly criticise American policy, while Jonah Wise blamed the British government and praised &quot;American generosity&quot;. 

Yoav Gelber concluded that &quot;if the conference were to lead to a mass emigration to places other than Palestine, the Zionist leaders were not particularly interested in its work.&quot; Years later, while noting that American and British Jewish leaders were &quot;very helpful to our work behind the scenes, [but] were not notably enthusiastic about it in public&quot;, Edward Turnour who led the British delegation recalled the &quot;stubbornly unrealistic approach&quot; of some leading Zionists who insisted on Palestine as the only option for the refugees.

==Consequences==

The result of the failure of the conference was that many of the Jews had no escape and so were ultimately subject to what was known as Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;. Two months after Évian, in September 1938, Britain and France granted Hitler the right to occupy the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. In November 1938, on Kristallnacht, a massive pogrom across the Third Reich was accompanied by the destruction of over 1,000 synagogues, massacres and the mass arrests of tens of thousands of Jews. In March 1939, Hitler occupied more of Czechoslovakia, causing a further 180,000 Jews to fall under Axis control, while in May 1939 the British issued the White Paper which barred Jews from entering Palestine or buying land there. Following their occupation of Poland in late 1939 and invasion of Soviet Union in 1941, the Nazis embarked on a program of systematically killing all Jews in Europe.

==Reaction==
German dictator Adolf Hitler said in response to the conference:
In her autobiography &quot;My Life&quot; (1975), Golda Meir described her outrage being in &quot;the ludicrous capacity of the [Jewish] observer from Palestine, not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people...&quot; After the conference Meir told the press: &quot;There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.&quot;

In July 1979, Walter Mondale described the hope represented by the Evian conference:At stake at Evian were both human lives – and the decency and self-respect of the civilized world. If each nation at Evian had agreed on that day to take in 17,000 Jews at once, every Jew in the Reich could have been saved. As one American observer wrote, &#x27;It is heartbreaking to think of the ... desperate human beings ... waiting in suspense for what happens at Evian. But the question they underline is not simply humanitarian ... it is a test of civilization.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground is a book by Michael J. Moynihan and Didrik Søderlind. It is an account of the early Norwegian black metal scene, with a focus on the string of church burnings and murders that occurred in the country around 1993. A film adaptation of the book was directed by Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund in 2018. The book has been the subject of controversy over the alleged political leanings of author Michael Moynihan, though he denies these allegations.

==Publication history==
&quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; was originally published by Feral House in 1998 (). A second, revised edition was released in 2003 and expands the original book by fifty pages (). A German edition was published in 2002 with a respective revised edition following in 2005 ().

==Summary==
The book focuses on the scene surrounding the extreme heavy metal subgenre black metal in Norway between 1990 and 1993. The first few chapters give an outline of the progression of heavy metal from bands such as Black Sabbath, Coven and Black Widow to proto-black metal bands such as Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Celtic Frost, Sarcófago, Hellhammer and Venom, and finally to the early Norwegian black metal band Mayhem.

The book then details the April 1991 suicide of Mayhem frontman Per Yngve &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin and the formation of a radicalized &quot;inner circle&quot; around Øystein &quot;Euronymous&quot; Aarseth, based out of his small black metal retail shop Helvete (Norwegian for &quot;hell&quot;) in Oslo, Norway.

In 1992 and 1993, members of the group became connected with a series of crimes, starting with the arson of the Fantoft stave church on June 6, 1992, although the book mentions that there had previously been a &quot;small, ineffectual fire at Storeveit Church&quot;. Church arsons continued but with a steady decline up until 1995. (The cover of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; shows a &quot;19th-century Swedish church in flames&quot;.)

An interview in a Norwegian newspaper given by Burzum founder Varg &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot; Vikernes, also a member of the Helvete group, leads to a media outrage condemning the arsons as acts of Satanism. On August 21, 1992, Bård &quot;Faust&quot; Eithun of the band Emperor murdered a homosexual man in the Olympic Park in Lillehammer. He was subsequently convicted of this crime and sentenced to 14 years in prison (of which he served nine before being released in 2003). On August 10, 1993, Aarseth was murdered by Vikernes, who received a 21-year sentence for the murder and several cases of arson related to the church burnings.

The book also mentions other cases of &quot;Satanic&quot; murderers, such as that of Sandro Beyer by members of the German National Socialist black metal band Absurd and Caleb Fairley in the USA. It also devotes several pages to the case of a self-styled teen militia named &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; that perpetrated murder and arson in Fort Myers, Florida, in April 1996. 

Interview passages with Varg Vikernes are spread out through several sections of the book. On Burzum.org Vikernes has said he would not use the term &quot;Nazi&quot; any longer as self-descriptor; however, the statement is ambiguous.

An interview with Vikernes about Nasjonal Samling founder Vidkun Quisling, executed in 1945 for high treason by the Norwegian government after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, is the main proof of Vikernes&#x27; admiration of him, and the proof of the rumor that Quisling had some influence on certain extreme strains of Norwegian black metal.

The book presents other interviews with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, Tomas &quot;Samoth&quot; Haugen of Emperor, and Dani Filth of Cradle of Filth. Filth claims the existence of a &quot;Satanic Gestapo&quot;, when he recounts an incident where he was apparently attacked on stage with a knife (which he states may have been a prop) during a concert in Germany.

The authors put forward their own thesis about the reason behind the extreme music, the arsons and the cases of murder, interpreting these events as the appearance of an odinic archetype. Within this scope, the psychologist Carl Jung is quoted and also a study &quot;Pathological firesetting&quot; from 1951.
Satanism and the heathenism from which it ultimately descends are themselves the products of the archetypes and differentiated psyches of nations and peoples, and they therefore spring from the same “occult” or mystical sources as nationalism itself. Nationalism is the political manifestation of a folk’s unconscious; heathenism/Satanism is the spiritual manifestation.

The book goes on to compare the state sought by the commission of these violent acts with the apocalyptic Norse tale Ragnarök, but states that neither radicalized black metallers nor &quot;their occasional allies, the right-wing revolutionaries&quot; may have found &quot;the fuse on the powderkeg of alienated resentment which lies behind the façade of 20th-century civilisation&quot;, yet that such a &quot;powderkeg&quot; exists nonetheless.

==Critical reaction==
Reviews of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; have been mixed, with several critics praising the book for offering an informative or at least interesting view on a relatively obscure subculture, and the book won a 1998 Firecracker Alternative Book Award. The publication was sometimes criticized for a perceived lack of distance towards its subject matter. This was considered especially alarming to groups and figures that had accused Moynihan of right-wing sympathies, charges he has denied.

German online magazine &quot;Telepolis&quot; questioned Moynihan&#x27;s neutrality towards the ideologies portrayed in the book, as it leaves several far-right and racist statements by interviewees such as Vikernes uncommented on and uncriticized. The author&#x27;s questions during these interviews are noted to resemble &quot;cue-giving&quot; at times.

While a reviewer for the left-oriented German newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; did not appreciate Moynihan earning royalties from the sales of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, he still called it &quot;the most thrilling non-fiction book since the Old Testament&quot;.
Televangelist Bob Larson stated that he and Moynihan were &quot;poles apart spiritually and philosophically&quot;, but that he respected the book as an &quot;exhaustive resource regarding the seamy and Satanic side of pop music and culture&quot;.

Journalist Kevin Coogan wrote an essay titled &quot;How Black Is Black Metal?&quot; in which he discusses several of the ideas purported in &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;. Coogan considers Moynihan&#x27;s personal political beliefs to be &quot;at work just below the surface of a text ostensibly devoted solely to analyzing an extremist musical sub-culture&quot; and ultimately counters the book&#x27;s apocalyptic thesis with the conclusion that the black metal/fascism connection hangs largely &quot;on a thin evidentiary thread&quot;, namely Varg Vikernes, who had shown extremist tendencies well before entering the scene. Coogan states that Moynihan is &quot;an extreme rightist whose fusion of politics and aesthetic violence shapes a not-so-hidden sub current that runs throughout LOC&quot;. Coogan writes that the book itself:

...is not a &quot;fascist&quot; tract in the strict sense of the term, in part because Moynihan co-wrote the book with Didrik Søderlind, a former music critic for a mainstream Norwegian paper who is now &quot;(as of 2005)&quot; an editor at Playboy. Moreover, Feral House editor Adam Parfrey clearly wanted to publish a popular book on the strange universe of black metal rather than a political polemic.

Moynihan, in turn, has denied Coogan&#x27;s allegations.

Varg Vikernes, a primary focal point of the book, has criticized the book. Vikernes states that the authors of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; have no &quot;insight into or even good knowledge about the subjects discussed&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t understand one bit what Black Metal was about in 1991 and 1992&quot; and that they &quot;have managed to fill the heads of a generation of metal fans with lies&quot;.

==Adaptation==
A 2018 feature film adaptation directed by Jonas Åkerlund premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2018, in Park City, Utah. It stars Rory Culkin and Emory Cohen in the roles of Euronymous and Varg Vikernes respectively. Jack Kilmer, Anthony De La Torre and Jonathan Barnwell portray Dead, Hellhammer and Necrobutcher of the band Mayhem. The cast also includes Sky Ferreira, Valter Skarsgård and Lucian Charles Collier.

<text>The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a 1956 summer workshop widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field. The workshop has been referred to as &quot;the Constitutional Convention of AI&quot;. The project&#x27;s four organizers, those being Claude Shannon, John McCarthy, Nathaniel Rochester and Marvin Minsky, are considered some of the founding fathers of AI.

The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks and was essentially an extended brainstorming session. Eleven mathematicians and scientists originally planned to attend; not all of them attended, but more than ten others came for short times.

== Background ==

In the early 1950s, there were various names for the field of &quot;thinking machines&quot;: cybernetics, automata theory, and complex information processing. The variety of names suggests the variety of conceptual orientations.

In 1955, John McCarthy, then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College, decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines. He picked the name &#x27;Artificial Intelligence&#x27; for the new field. He chose the name partly for its neutrality; avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory, and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback, as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive Norbert Wiener as guru or having to argue with him.

In early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and Claude Shannon, a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.

On September 2, 1955, the project was formally proposed by McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon. The proposal is credited with introducing the term &#x27;artificial intelligence&#x27;.

The Proposal states:

The proposal goes on to discuss computers, natural language processing, neural networks, theory of computation, abstraction and creativity (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field).

On May 26, 1956, McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees:

For the full period:
: 1) Dr. Marvin Minsky 
: 2) Dr. Julian Bigelow
: 3) Professor D.M. Mackay
: 4) Mr. Ray Solomonoff
: 5) Mr. John Holland
: 6) Dr. John McCarthy

For four weeks:
: 7) Dr. Claude Shannon
: 8) Mr. Nathaniel Rochester
: 9) Mr. Oliver Selfridge

For the first two weeks:
: 10) Dr. Allen Newell
: 11) Professor Herbert Simon

He noted, &quot;we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations. This of course is subject to change when the group gets together.&quot;

The actual participants came at different times, mostly for much shorter times. Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend—but the project was set to begin. 
Around June 18, 1956, the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff, maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H., to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there. Solomonoff and Minsky stayed at Professors&#x27; apartments, but most would stay at the Hanover Inn.

== Dates ==

The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956. Ray Solomonoff&#x27;s notes written during the Workshop, however, say it ran for roughly eight weeks, from about June 18 to August 17. Solomonoff&#x27;s Dartmouth notes start on June 22; June 28 mentions Minsky, June 30 mentions Hanover, N.H., July 1 mentions Tom Etter. On August 17, Solomonoff gave a final talk.

== Participants ==

Initially, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Instead, after the workshop, McCarthy sent Solomonoff a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject. There were 47 people listed.

Solomonoff, however, made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:

# Ray Solomonoff
# Marvin Minsky
# John McCarthy
# Claude Shannon
# Trenchard More
# Nat Rochester
# Oliver Selfridge
# Julian Bigelow
# W. Ross Ashby
# W.S. McCulloch
# Abraham Robinson
# Tom Etter
# John Nash
# David Sayre
# Arthur Samuel
# Kenneth R. Shoulders
# Shoulders&#x27; friend
# Alex Bernstein
# Herbert Simon
# Allen Newell 

Shannon attended Solomonoff&#x27;s talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15. Solomonoff doesn&#x27;t mention Bernard Widrow, but apparently he visited, along with W.A. Clark and B.G. Farley. Trenchard mentions R. Culver and Solomonoff mentions Bill Shutz. Herb Gelernter didn&#x27;t attend, but was influenced later by what Rochester learned. 

In an article in IEEE Spectrum, Grace Solomonoff additionally identifies Peter Milner on a photo taken by Nathaniel Rochester in front of Dartmouth Hall.

Ray Solomonoff, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full-time. Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.

== Event and aftermath ==

They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves, and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his ideas, or more frequently, a general discussion would be held.

It was not a directed group research project; discussions covered many topics, but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods, systems focused on limited domains (early expert systems), and deductive systems versus inductive systems. One participant, Arthur Samuel, said, &quot;It was very interesting, very stimulating, very exciting&quot;.

Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions.

<doc id="1124650" wikidata="Q602095" url="?curid=1124650" title="More Than a Feeling">
<text>&quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; is a song by the American rock band Boston, released as the lead single and the opening track from the band&#x27;s 1976 debut album by Epic Records in September 1976, with &quot;Smokin&#x27; as the B-side. Tom Scholz wrote the entire song. The single entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 18 and peaked at number five. The track is now a staple of classic rock radio, and in 2008, it was named the 39th-best hard rock song of all time by VH1. It was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; and was ranked number 212 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list in 2021, updated from its previous position of number 500 on the 2004 version.

==Background and writing==
&quot;More than a Feeling&quot; took Scholz five years to complete. Scholz wrote the lyrics based on the idea of losing someone close, and on the way in which music can connect a person to memories of the past. Though not based on any specific event in Scholz&#x27;s life, he did take the name Marianne from his cousin. It is one of six songs (five of which eventually appeared on the &quot;Boston&quot; album) that he worked on in his basement from 1968 to 1975, before Boston got its record contract. The drum parts were originally developed by Jim Masdea, although Sib Hashian played the drums on the official release. The song is in compound AABA form.

==Content==

&quot;The Book of Rock Lists&quot; suggests that the chorus riff may itself be a subtle homage to the Kingsmen&#x27;s classic, &quot;Louie Louie.&quot; Scholz has stated in multiple interviews his fondness for the James Gang, and in particular that band&#x27;s 1970s album, &quot;James Gang Rides Again&quot;. Accordingly, the signature riff for &quot;More than a Feeling&quot; bears a resemblance to that composed by Joe Walsh for the &quot;Rides Again&quot; track &quot;Tend My Garden&quot;. Scholz credits &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot; by The Left Banke as the song&#x27;s main inspiration.

Boston&#x27;s website says the song is about &quot;the power an old song can have in your life&quot;, with Scholz elaborating that &quot;it was sort of a bittersweet ballad.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Michael Gallucci points out that this is a common theme in Boston songs.

The lyrics express the author&#x27;s discontent with the present and his yearning for a former love named Marianne, whose memory is strongly evoked by an old familiar song. In an interview Scholz was asked, &quot;Who is Marianne?&quot; He replied, &quot;There actually is a Marianne. She wasn&#x27;t my girlfriend.&quot; He explained that when he was 8 or 9 years old he had a much older cousin who he thought was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen and that he was &quot;secretly in love&quot; with her (laughs), but he has also stated that the lyrics were inspired by his emotions after a school love affair ended, and were influenced by the lyrics of the Left Banke song &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot;. &quot;Maximum Guitar&quot; author Andy Aledort pointed out that the guitar chord progression of G-D/F-Em7-D that follows the line &quot;I see my Marianne walking away&quot; also comes from &quot;Walk Away Renee.&quot; Aledort also explains that the guitar solo is unusual in that it incorporates mordents and inverted mordents, which are more typically used in baroque music.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; as an &quot;electric guitar-dominated rocker...made commercial with an accessible beat and hand-clap backup and smooth, soaring vocals.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said &quot;it’s a hard-rock offering, but has a sophisticated melody that makes good use of minor chords&quot; and has &quot;attractive&quot; unison guitar work and powerful vocals. &quot;Record World&quot; said that with the song Boston &quot;shows it is adept at rocking with a heavy metal fury, yet at the same time builds a dynamic tension around the melody of the tune.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Paul Elliott rated it as &quot;Boston&#x27;s all-time greatest song&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn called it a &quot;marvelously appealing pop-rock single&quot; and said that it ranks with Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; as one of the best singles of 1976. Hilburn also said that the song combines &quot;the graceful splendor and rousing melodic hooks of the Moody Blues, the strident guitar impact of Queen&#x27;s Brian May and some of the romantic pop-rock consciousness of Eric Carmen and the old Raspberries.&quot;

&quot;Guitar World&quot; states that when the radio plays &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;few can resist indulging in fits of fleet-fingered air guitar and a spirited falsetto sing-along.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; critic Paul Evans states that &quot;as slick as it sounds, &#x27;More Than a Feeling&#x27; strikes an uncommonly resonant emotional note.&quot; Gallucci rated it Boston&#x27;s greatest song, as did &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Dave Swanson rated it the number-28 all-time classic rock song.

==Covers and use in politics and other media==
* In 1992, when Nirvana performed their breakthrough single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, at the Reading Festival, they incorporated part of &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; at the beginning, a reference to the similarities between the two songs&#x27; main guitar riffs. This part is included on the DVD version of Nirvana&#x27;s live album, &quot;Live at Reading&quot;.
* In 2008 Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee used the song to promote his campaign. Former Boston band member Barry Goudreau made appearances with Huckabee both live and on YouTube. In February 2008, Scholz wrote to Huckabee requesting that he stop using the song, stating: &quot;While I&#x27;m flattered that you are fond of my song, I&#x27;m shocked that you would use it and the name Boston to promote yourself without my consent. Your campaign&#x27;s use of &#x27;More Than a Feeling&#x27;, coupled with the representation of one of your supporters as a member &#x27;of Boston&#x27; clearly implies that the band Boston, and specifically one of its members, has endorsed your candidacy, neither of which is true.&quot; Huckabee complied with Scholz&#x27;s request, and videos featuring Barry Goudreau and the song were subsequently removed by the Huckabee campaign. 

==Downloadable content for music games==
*The song was covered by WaveGroup Sound as part of the soundtrack for the original &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; released in 2005, and later released as a master recording on &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero Live&quot;″s &quot;GHTV&quot;.
*The song was made available to download on March 1, 2011, for use in the &quot;Rock Band&quot; music video game series.

<text>Club Moral is a Belgian artist collective and noise band formed in 1981 by Danny Devos and Anne-Mie van Kerckhoven based in Antwerp, Belgium. They are known for their controversial performances and imagery. In 2001 &quot;Dylan&quot; briefly joined the band. Between 2003 and 2011 Mauro Pawlowski joined the band. And in 2010 and 2011 Aldo Struyf played bass and Orphan Fairytale played harps in the band. Since 2012 Devos and van Kerckhoven are the sole member performing music concerts.

== History ==
=== 1981-1987 ===
From 1981 until 1987 Club Moral acted as both a venue and performance band. Club Moral the venue was in Antwerp where numerous exhibitions, performances, concerts, lectures and film-shows were organized. Club Moral the band had its first performance on September 19, 1981. The show was billed as an &quot;Attack&quot; and took place at the event &quot;Das Konzil&quot;, organized by Boris Nieslony in the Künstlerhaus of Stuttgart, Germany. According to DDV, &quot;The Club Moral &#x27;attack&#x27; took place in a small room with no windows and all 4 walls covered with mattresses. We played very loud with heavy bass volumes. At the end of the concert people were complaining of nausea and vomiting.&quot;

As a venue, the first documented show at Club Moral took place June 19, 1981 and featured Etat Brut performing live with Mécanique Végétale.

Club Moral continued to both perform and act as a venue through 1987. Acts that have performed at Club Moral have included Boyd Rice (NON), Michael Moynihan (Coup De Grace), Slave State, Whitehouse, Trevor Brown, Culturcide, John Duncan, Jack Stevenson and many, many more.

Since 1983 they published a magazine Force Mental, of which 15 issues have appeared in print. A sixteenth issue was published on the internet in 2004 and a &#x27;Force Mental RVSTD&#x27; facsimile edition of all issues was printed in 2010.

=== 2004-present ===
In 2005 Club Moral was declared dead by its founders and a War Memorial made for all those who ever performed, played or exhibited at Club Moral or contributed to Force Mental. About 300 names carved in a slab of green marble, 140 x 280 cm. The monument resides in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp).

The noise band claimed to cease its activities after a performance at the Death Petrol festival in Antwerp, Belgium; in 2006, Club Moral restructured as a new band called Bum Collar, an anagram of the band name with a new member: Belgian writer Paul Mennes.

Bum Collar performed a number of gigs between 2006 and 2007, but in late 2007 Club Moral was resurrected for a show at De Resoor, Sint-Truiden. The show was billed as, &quot;After two years of silence Club Moral will perform on stage live again. We have abandoned our improvisational gigs and get back to our original repertoire with stunning versions of our best tracks. An opportunity not to miss!&quot;.

In 2010 a new series of concerts took off with Danny Devos on vocals, Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven on electronics, Mauro Pawlowski on drums and Aldo Struyf on bass.

Since 2015 Club Moral performed several times in its original setting with Devos on vocals and electronics and Van Kerckhoven on electronics. On both occasions the performance was on the occasion of an exhibition by Van Kerckhoven, at the Kunstverein München and castillo/corrales in Paris.

<text>This article lists the rulers of [[Shewa]], a historical region of Ethiopia.

== c. 960–1270 ==
According to tradition, the Solomonic dynasty (1270–1974) was descended from king Solomon and queen Makeda via the kings of Axum. After Axum was destroyed by Gudit in the 10th century, the royal family fled to Shewa and reigned there for 330 years before the accession of Yekuno Amlak. A line of kings ruled at Shewa during the time of the Zagwe dynasty and claimed descent from Dil Na&#x27;od, the last king of Axum. The 1922 regnal list of Ethiopia includes eight unnumbered kings described as &quot;8 generations of an Israelitish dynasty&quot; who &quot;did not mount the throne&quot;.
== 1682–1889 ==
Claiming Solomonic descent, Nagasi Krestos established Shewa as an autonomous region of the weakening Ethiopian Empire in the 17th century before requesting the title of &quot;Meridazmatch&quot;, which would be adopted by his successors, and beginning a southern expansion of his realm that would culminate in the conquests of his descendant Menelik II.

<text>There have been 91 gubernatorial elections in the state of New York since 1777, with the most recent being held on November 8, 2022. The next election is scheduled to be held on November 3, 2026.
==General information==

Originally the term for governor of New York was three years long and began on July 1, the election being held in the last week of April or May 1. In 1817, following the resignation of Daniel D. Tompkins after serving only eight months of his term, there was a new election, since the 1777 Constitution did not give the lieutenant governor the right to succeed to the governor&#x27;s office, and DeWitt Clinton was elected for a whole three-year-term. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 reduced the term to two years – beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 – and moved the election to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Due to this measure, DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s own second term was cut short by half a year. Beginning with the election in 1876, the term was increased to three years again, beginning with the election in 1894 reduced to two years, and since the election in 1938 has its present duration of four years.

Although the candidates for lieutenant governor have always run on tickets with the governor&#x27;s candidates, until the election of 1950 they were elected on separate ballots, so on several occasions (1826, 1846, 1850, 1906, and 1924) the governor and his lieutenant were elected of opposing tickets.

In only 15 of the total 91 elections has the incumbent lost re-election.

The elected candidates are shown in bold face in the tables below.

===1777-1820===
Gubernatorial elections under the State Constitution of 1777. The term was three years, the election held in the last week of April or on May 1.

Note:
* Tompkins was the sitting US Vice President.
* DeWitt Clinton was legislated out of office on December 31, 1822.

Note: Governor Tompkins was elected US Vice President in November 1816, and he resigned in February 1817. Article XVII of the New York State Constitution of 1777 said that &quot;...as often as the seat of government shall become vacant, a wise and descreet freeholder of this State shall be, by ballot, elected governor... which elections shall be always held at the times and places of choosing representatives in assembly...&quot; This meant that, whenever a vacancy occurred, the Lt. Gov. did not succeed to the governor&#x27;s office but administrated the state only until the end of the yearly term of the New York State Assembly on June 30, the successor being elected in April.



Note: Lt. Gov. Broome died in August 1810, and the 1777 Constitution provided for new elections if a vacancy occurred either in the Governor&#x27;s or the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s office. See 1817 general election.



Note: Aaron Burr was the sitting US Vice President.




Note: John Jay received more votes than George Clinton, but on technicalities the votes of Otsego, Tioga and Clinton counties were disqualified and not counted, giving Clinton a slight majority. Under the Constitution of 1777, the votes were canvassed by a joint committee of the state legislature, six members each from the assembly and the senate. The members were David Gelston, Thomas Tillotson, Melancton Smith, David Graham, Pierre Van Cortlandt Jr., David McCarty, Jonathan N. Havens, Samuel Jones, Isaac Roosevelt, Leonard Gansevoort, and Joshua Sands. The state constitution said that the cast votes shall be delivered to the secretary of state &quot;by the sheriff or his deputy&quot;. The ballots from Otsego County were forwarded to the secretary of state by Sheriff Smith who was holding over in office until the appointment of a successor after his term had expired. The ballot box from Clinton County was delivered to the secretary of state&#x27;s office by a person without deputation who had received the box from the sheriff. The ballot box from Tioga County was delivered to the secretary of state by the clerk of the special deputy appointed by the sheriff. The canvass committee disagreed on whether to allow these ballots to be counted. The question was referred to the U.S. Senators from New York, Federalist Rufus King and Dem.-Rep. Aaron Burr, for arbitration. King said all votes ought to be canvassed. Burr said that the ballots from Clinton County ought to be allowed, and the ones from Otsego and Tioga Counties should be rejected. Thereupon, a majority of the canvass committee (Gelston, Tillotson, Smith, Graham, Van Cortlandt, McCarty, and Havens) rejected the ballots from all three counties and declared George Clinton duly elected governor by a majority of 108 votes. The minority (Jones, Roosevelt, Gansevoort, and Sands) protested in writing. In Otsego County, John Jay had a majority of about 400, and discounting the small majorities for Clinton in Tioga and Clinton Counties, would have won the election. Clinton was accused by the Federalists of usurpation and the canvass committee of having made a partisan decision against the wishes of the electorate.


Note: Clinton and Van Cortlandt were re-elected unopposed.


Note: Clinton and Van Cortlandt were re-elected unopposed.

Notes:
* The election began on June 1, but due to the Revolutionary War it took some time to collect and count the votes, and the official result was announced on July 9. George Clinton accepted the office of Governor on July 11 and assumed its duties immediately, pending taking the oath as soon as he could safely leave his military command.
* There were no parties yet; the Democratic-Republican and Federalist Parties appeared only in 1789, and until then the candidacies were personal. Besides, the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor were not &quot;running mates&quot;; all candidates were voted for independently.
* The Committee of Safety (the governing body of the State of New York after the Constitutional Convention adjourned) endorsed Philip Schuyler for Governor and George Clinton for Lieutenant Governor, which led to Clinton&#x27;s receiving votes for both offices and actually winning both. Clinton formally resigned the lieutenant governorship and Pierre Van Cortlandt was elected lieutenant governor in a special election in 1778.

<text>Van Buren State Park is a public recreation area surrounding Van Buren Lake in Hancock County, Ohio, in the United States. The state park covers abutting the southern boundary of the village of Van Buren and offers fishing, boating, camping, hiking, and other recreational activities.

==History==
The process of creating the park began in 1939 when a dam was built over Rocky Ford Creek creating Van Buren Lake as part of a private wildlife preserve. The lake and preserve were transferred to the state of Ohio for use as a state park in 1950.

==Ecology==
Van Buren State Park is in a rich agricultural area. Northwest Ohio is part of the Interior Plains region of North America. The land is largely flat with a few hills that are a remnant of the last ice age. Beneath the topsoil lies a layer of dolomitic limestone.

The park is in a small patch of woods surrounded by thousands of acres of fields of corn, wheat and soybeans. The land was largely forested before it was cleared by farmers. A small patch of woodland, made mostly of beech and sugar maple trees, remains at Van Buren State Park. Typical woodland mammals found in the park include white-tailed deer, red fox, red squirrel, skunk, and opossum. Bird species include the cowbird, woodcock, eastern bluebird, short-eared owl and eastern meadowlark. The park is also home to garter snakes and spring peepers. Wildflowers in the area include chicory, spring beauty, Dutchman&#x27;s breeches, daisy fleabane and thimbleweed.

==Activities and amenities==
The park features boating for hand- and electric-powered water craft, trails for hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders, and primitive, full-service and equestrian camping. Fish species found in the lake include largemouth bass, carp, bluegill, channel catfish, bullhead and crappie. Hunting is limited to bowhunting.

<text>Roger Harrison Mudd (February 9, 1928 – March 9, 2021) was an American broadcast journalist who was a correspondent and anchor for CBS News and NBC News. He also worked as the primary anchor for The History Channel. Previously, Mudd was weekend and weekday substitute anchor for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, the co-anchor of the weekday &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and the host of the NBC-TV &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and &quot;American Almanac&quot; TV programs. Mudd was the recipient of the Peabody Award, the Joan Shorenstein Award for Distinguished Washington Reporting, and five Emmy Awards.

==Early life and career==
Mudd was born in Washington, D.C. His father, a World War I veteran, John Kostka Dominic Mudd, was the son of a tobacco farmer and worked as a map maker for the United States Geological Survey. His mother, Irma Iris Harrison, was the daughter of a farmer and was a nurse and lieutenant in the United States Army Nurse Corps serving in the physiotherapy ward in the Walter Reed Hospital, where she met Roger&#x27;s father. Roger attended DC Public Schools and graduated from Wilson High School in 1945.

Mudd earned a Bachelor of Arts in History from Washington and Lee University, where one of his classmates was author Tom Wolfe, in 1950, and a Master of Arts in History from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1953. Mudd was a member of Delta Tau Delta international fraternity. He was initiated as an alumnus member of Omicron Delta Kappa at Washington and Lee in 1966.

Mudd began his journalism career in Richmond, Virginia, as a reporter for &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; and for radio station WRNL. At the &quot;News Leader&quot;, he worked at the rewrite desk during spring 1953 and became a summer replacement on June 15 that year. The &quot;News Leader&quot; ran its first story with a Mudd byline on June 19, 1953.

At WRNL radio, Mudd presented the daily noon newscast. In his memoir &quot;The Place to Be&quot;, Mudd describes an incident from his first day at WRNL in which he laughed hysterically on-air after mangling a news item about the declining health of Pope Pius XII, mispronouncing his name as &quot;Pipe Poeus&quot;. Because Mudd failed to silence his microphone properly, an engineer intervened. WRNL later gave Mudd his own daily broadcast, &quot;Virginia Headlines&quot;. In the fall of 1954, Mudd enrolled in the University of Richmond School of Law, but dropped out after one semester.

==WTOP News==

In the late 1950s, Mudd moved home to Washington, D.C., to become a reporter with WTOP News, the news division of the radio and television stations owned by Washington Post-Newsweek. Although WTOP News was a local news department, it also covered national stories. At first Mudd did the 6:00 a.m. newscast for WTOP and he did local news segments on the local TV program &quot;Potomac Panorama&quot;.

During the fall of 1956, Mudd hosted the first newscast he wrote, WTOP&#x27;s 6:00 p.m. newscast, that included a weekly commentary piece, all without &quot;the constraints of the wire service vocabulary&quot;. Mudd produced a half-hour TV documentary in summer 1957 advocating the need for a third airport in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.

In September that year, Mudd conducted his first live TV studio interview. The interview was with Dorothy Counts, a black teenage girl who had suffered racial harassment at her otherwise all-white high school in Charlotte, North Carolina. Then in March 1959 WTOP replaced Don Richards with Mudd for its 11 p.m. newscast.

==CBS News==
CBS News was located on the third floor of WTOP&#x27;s studios at 40th and Brandywine in northwest Washington, D.C. Mudd quickly came to the attention of CBS News and moved &quot;downstairs&quot; to join the Washington bureau on May 31, 1961. For most of his career at CBS, Mudd was a Congressional correspondent. Mudd was also the anchor of the Saturday edition of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and frequently substituted on the weekday and weeknight broadcasts when regular anchormen Douglas Edwards and Walter Cronkite were on vacation or working on special assignments. During the Civil Rights Movement, Mudd anchored the August 28, 1963, coverage of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom for CBS.

On November 13, 1963, CBS-TV broadcast the documentary &quot;Case History of a Rumor&quot;, in which Mudd interviewed Rep. James Utt, a Republican of Santa Ana, California, about a rumor that Utt spread about Africans who were supposedly working with the United Nations to take over the United States. Utt sued CBS-TV in U.S. Federal Court for libel, but the court dismissed the case.

In 1964, Mudd became nationally known for covering the two-month filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, starting in late-March.

Mudd also covered numerous political campaigns. He was paired with CBS journalist Robert Trout for the August 1964 Democratic National Convention anchor booth, temporarily displacing Walter Cronkite, in an unsuccessful attempt to match the popular NBC Chet Huntley–David Brinkley anchor team. Mudd covered the 1968 Presidential campaign of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy and interviewed him at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles only minutes before Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968.

Mudd hosted the seminal documentary &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon&quot; in 1971. He won Emmys for covering the shooting of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama in 1972 and the resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in 1973, and two more for CBS specials on the Watergate scandal. In 1981, he was a candidate to succeed Walter Cronkite as anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News.&quot; Despite substantial support for Mudd within the ranks of CBS News and an offer to co-host with Dan Rather, network management gave the position to Rather after the longtime White House and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent threatened to leave the network for ABC News.

===Ted Kennedy interview===
Mudd is best known for an interview with Senator Ted Kennedy broadcast on November 4, 1979. The CBS Reports special &quot;Teddy&quot;, appeared three days before Kennedy announced his challenge to President Jimmy Carter for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination. In addition to questioning Kennedy about the Chappaquiddick incident, Mudd asked, &quot;Senator, why do you want to be President?&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s stammering answer, which has been described as &quot;incoherent and repetitive&quot; and &quot;vague, unprepared&quot;, while the senator &quot;twitched and squirmed&quot; for an hour, raised serious questions about his motivation in seeking the office, and marked the beginning of the sharp decline in Kennedy&#x27;s poll numbers.

Mudd described the reply as &quot;almost a parody of a politician&#x27;s answer&quot;. Chris Whipple of &quot;Life&quot;, waiting to interview Kennedy, recalled being amazed by

Carter defeated Kennedy for the nomination for a second presidential term. Although the Kennedy family refused any further interviews by Mudd, the interview helped strengthen Mudd&#x27;s reputation as a leading political journalist.

Mudd won a Peabody Award for the interview. He described as a &quot;fantasy&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s statement in the latter&#x27;s posthumous memoir, &quot;True Compass&quot;, that Mudd had asked for an interview to help him succeed Cronkite at CBS, and promised that he would not ask personal questions. Mudd said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I should be known as the man who brought Teddy Kennedy down. I was the man who did an interview with him that was not helpful&quot;. Whipple said that Mudd thought that the interview was a failure, and that Whipple had to assure him that Kennedy&#x27;s incoherence would be a major story. Broadcaster and blogger Hugh Hewitt and &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Michael Gerson have used the term &quot;Roger Mudd moment&quot; to describe a self-inflicted disastrous encounter with the press by a presidential candidate.

==NBC News==

In 1980, Mudd and Dan Rather were in contention to succeed Walter Cronkite as the weeknight anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. After CBS awarded the job to Rather (which he took over on March 9, 1981), Mudd chose to leave CBS News and he accepted an offer to join NBC News. He co-anchored the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Tom Brokaw from April 1982 until September 1983, when Brokaw took over as sole anchor.

From 1984 to 1985, Mudd was the co-moderator of the NBC &quot;Meet the Press&quot; program with Marvin Kalb, and later served as the co-anchor with Connie Chung on two NBC news magazines, &quot;American Almanac&quot; and &quot;1986&quot;.

==PBS and The History Channel==
From 1987 to 1993, Mudd was an essayist and political correspondent with the &quot;MacNeil–Lehrer Newshour&quot; on PBS. He was a visiting professor at Princeton University and Washington and Lee University from 1993 to 1996. Mudd was also a primary anchor for over ten years with The History Channel, where many of his programs are still repeated in reruns. Mudd retired from full-time broadcasting in 2004, and remained involved, until his death, with documentaries for The History Channel.

==Personal life==
Mudd resided in McLean, Virginia. He was married to the former E. J. Spears of Richmond, Virginia, who died in 2011. They had three sons and a daughter: Daniel, the former CEO of Fortress Investment Group LLC and the former CEO of Fannie Mae; the singer and songwriter Jonathan Mudd; the author Maria Mudd Ruth; and Matthew Mudd. He was survived by 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Mudd was a collateral descendant of Samuel Mudd (meaning he descended from another branch within the same extensive family tree), the doctor who was imprisoned for allegedly aiding and conspiring with John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

Mudd was active as a trustee of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, with which he helped to establish its popular &quot;Ethics Bowl&quot;, featuring student teams from Virginia&#x27;s private colleges debating real-life cases involving ethical dilemmas. He was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery.

On December 10, 2010, he donated $4 million to his alma mater, Washington and Lee University, to establish the Roger Mudd Center for the Study of Professional Ethics and to endow a Roger Mudd Professorship in Ethics. &quot;For 60 years,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for a chance to acknowledge Washington and Lee&#x27;s gifts to me. Given the state of ethics in our current culture, this seems a fitting time to endow a center for the study of ethics, and my university is its fitting home.&quot;

Mudd died from complications of kidney failure at his home in McLean, Virginia, on March 9, 2021, at the age of 93.
