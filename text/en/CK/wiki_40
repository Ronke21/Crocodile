<text>A first-person shooter engine is a video game engine specialized for simulating 3D environments for use in a first-person shooter video game. First-person refers to the view where the players see the world from the eyes of their characters. Shooter refers to games which revolve primarily around wielding firearms and killing other entities in the game world, either non-player characters or other players.

The development of the FPS graphic engines is characterized by a steady increase in technologies, with some breakthroughs. Attempts at defining distinct generations lead to arbitrary choices of what constitutes a highly modified version of an &#x27;old engine&#x27; and what is a new engine.

The classification is complicated as game engines blend old and new technologies. Features considered advanced in a new game one year, become the expected standard the next year. Games with a combination of both older and newer features are the norm. For example, &quot;Jurassic Park: Trespasser&quot; (1998) introduced physics to the FPS genre, which did not become common until around 2002. &quot;Red Faction&quot; (2001) featured a destructible environment, something still not common in engines years later.

==Timeline==
=== 1970s and 1980s: Early FPS graphics engines ===
Game rendering for this early generation of FPS were already from the first-person perspective and with the need to shoot things, however they were mostly made up using vector graphics.

There are two possible claimants for the first FPS, &quot;Maze War&quot; and &quot;Spasim&quot;. &quot;Maze War&quot; was developed in 1973 and involved a single player making his way through a maze of corridors rendered using a fixed perspective. Multiplayer capabilities, where players attempted to shoot each other, were added later and were networked in 1974. &quot;Spasim&quot; was originally developed in 1974 and involved players moving through a wire-frame 3D universe. &quot;Spasim&quot; could be played by up to 32 players on the PLATO network.

Developed in-house by Incentive Software, the Freescape engine is considered to be one of the first proprietary 3D engines to be used for computer games, although the engine was not used commercially outside of Incentive&#x27;s own titles. The first game to use this engine was the puzzle game &quot;Driller&quot; in 1987.

===Early 1990s: Wireframes to 2.5D worlds and textures===
Games of this generation often had &quot;3D&quot; in their names but were not capable of full 3D rendering. Instead, they used ray casting 2.5D techniques to create a seemingly 3D environment from a 2D map, and flat sprites to draw enemies instead of 3D models. These games also began to use textures for environmental geometry instead of simple wire-frame models or solid colors.

&quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;, from id Software, was the first to use this technique in 1990, but was still not using textures, a capability which was added shortly after on &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot; (1991), then with the Wolfenstein 3D engine which was later used for several other games. &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot; was also the first game to show the player character&#x27;s hand on-screen, furthering the implication of the player into the character&#x27;s role.

&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine was still very primitive. It did not apply textures to the floor and ceiling, and the ray casting restricted walls to a fixed height, and levels were all on the same plane.

Even though it was still not using true 3D, id Tech 1, first used in &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) and again from id Software, removed these limitations. It also first introduced the concept of binary space partitioning (BSP). Another breakthrough was the introduction of multiplayer abilities in the engine. However, because it was still using 2.5D, it was impossible to look up and down properly in &quot;Doom&quot;, and all &quot;Doom&quot; levels were actually two-dimensional. Due to the lack of a z-axis, the engine did not allow for room-over-room support.

&quot;Doom&quot;&#x27;s success spawned several games using the same engine or similar techniques, giving rise to the term &quot;Doom&quot; clones. The Build engine, used in &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (1996), later removed some of the limitations of id Tech 1, such as the Build engine being able to have support for room-over-room by stacking sectors on top of sectors, but the techniques used remained the same.

===Mid 1990s: 3D models, beginnings of hardware acceleration===
In the mid-1990s, game engines recreated true 3D worlds with arbitrary level geometry. Instead of sprites the engines used simply textured (single-pass texturing, no lighting details) polygonal objects.

FromSoftware released &quot;King&#x27;s Field&quot;, a full polygon free roaming first-person real-time action title for the Sony PlayStation in December 1994. Sega&#x27;s 32X release &quot;Metal Head&quot; was a first-person shooter mecha simulation game that used fully texture-mapped, 3D polygonal graphics. A year prior, Exact released the Sharp X68000 computer game &quot;Geograph Seal&quot;, a fully 3D polygonal first-person shooter that employed platform game mechanics and had most of the action take place in free-roaming outdoor environments rather than the corridor labyrinths of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. The following year, Exact released its successor for the PlayStation console, &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot;, which used the same game engine but adapted it to place more emphasis on the platforming rather than the shooting. The &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; series continued to use the same engine.

&quot;Dark Forces&quot;, released in 1995 by LucasArts, has been regarded as one of the first &quot;true 3-D&quot; first-person shooter games. Its engine, the Jedi Engine, was one of the first engines to support an environment in three dimensions: areas can exist next to each other in all three planes, including on top of each other (such as stories in a building). Though most of the objects in &quot;Dark Forces&quot; are sprites, the game does include support for textured 3D-rendered objects. Another game regarded as one of the first true 3D first-person shooter is Parallax Software&#x27;s 1994 shooter &quot;Descent&quot;.

The Quake engine (&quot;Quake&quot;, 1996) used fewer animated sprites and used true 3D geometry and lighting, using elaborate techniques such as z-buffering to speed up the rendering. Levels in &quot;Quake&quot; and some subsequent engines are made with geometry objects called brushes, which allow for map construction in three dimensions, rather than 2D maps projected in 3D, as &quot;Doom&quot; had done. &quot;Quake&quot; was also the first true-3D game to use a special map design system to preprocess and pre-render the 3D environment: the 3D environment in which the game took place (referred for the first time as a Map) was simplified during the creation of the map to reduce the processing required when playing the game.

Static lightmaps and 3D light sources were also &quot;baked&quot; at render time and added to the BSP files storing the levels. These features allowing for more realistic lighting than had previously been possible.

The first Graphics processing units appeared in the late 1990s, but many games still supported software rendering at that time. id Tech 2 (&quot;Quake II&quot;, 1997) was one of the first games to take advantage of hardware accelerated graphics (id Software later reworked &quot;Quake&quot; to add OpenGL support to the game).

GoldSrc, the engine derived from the Quake engine by Valve for &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), added Direct3D support, and a skeletal framework to better render the NPCs, and also greatly improved the NPCs artificial intelligence (AI) compared to the Quake engine.

===Late 1990s: Full 32-bit color, and GPUs become standard===
This period saw the introduction of the first video cards with Transform, clipping, and lighting (T&amp;L). The first card with this innovative technology was the GeForce 256. This card was superior to what 3dfx had to offer at the time, namely Voodoo3, which only fell short because the lack of T&amp;L. Companies such as Matrox with their G400, and S3 with their Savage4 were forced to withdraw from the 3D gaming market during this time period. One year later, ATI released their Radeon 7200, a true competing graphics card line.

While all games of this period supported 16-bit color, many were adopting 32-bit color (really 24-bit color with an 8-bit alpha channel) as well. Soon, many benchmark sites began touting 32-bit as a standard. The Unreal Engine, used in a large number of FPS games since its release, was an important milestone at the time. It used the Glide API, specifically developed for 3dfx GPUs, instead of OpenGL. Probably the biggest reason for its popularity was that the engine architecture and the inclusion of a scripting language made it easy to mod it. One other improvement of Unreal compared to the previous generation of engines was its networking technology, which greatly improved the scalability of the engine on multiplayer.

id Tech 3, first used for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, improved from its predecessor by allowing to store much more complex and smoother animations. It also had improved lighting and shadowing and introduced shaders and curved surfaces.

===Early 2000s: Increasing detail, outdoor environments, and rag-doll physics===
New graphics hardware provided new capabilities, allowing new engines to add various new effects, such as particle effects or fog, as well as increase texture and polygon detail. Many games featured large outdoor environments, vehicles, and rag-doll physics.

Average Video Hardware requirements: a GPU with hardware T&amp;L such as the DirectX 7.0 GeForce 2 or Radeon 7200 was typically required. The next-generation GeForce 3 or Radeon 8500 were recommended due to their more efficient architecture, though their DirectX 8.0 vertex and pixel shaders were of little use. A handful of games still supported DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as RIVA TNT2 and Rage 128, and software rendering (with an integrated Intel GMA), though this was apparent that even a powerful CPU could not compensate for the lack of hardware T&amp;L.

Games engines originally developed for the PC platform, like the Unreal Engine 2, started to be adapted for sixth generation consoles like PlayStation 2 or GameCube, those now having the computer power to handle graphic-intensive video games.

===Mid 2000s: Lighting and pixel shaders, physics===
The new generation of graphics chips allowed pixel shader-based textures, bump mapping, and lighting and shadowing technologies to become common. Shader technologies included HLSL (for DirectX), GLSL (for OpenGL), or Cg.

This resulted in the obsolescence of DirectX 7.0 graphics chips such as the widespread GeForce 2 and Radeon 7200, as well as DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as RIVA TNT2 and Rage 128, and integrated on-board graphics accelerators. Until this generation of games, a powerful CPU was able to somewhat compensate for an older video card. Average Video Hardware requirements: minimum was a GeForce 3 or Radeon 8500, strongly recommended was the GeForce FX, Radeon 9700 (or other cards with Pixel shader 2.x support). The Radeon 9700 demonstrated that anti-aliasing (AA) and/or anisotropic filtering (AF) could be fully usable options, even in the newest and most demanding titles at the time, and resulted in the widespread acceptance of AA and AF as standard features. AA and AF had been supported by many earlier graphics chips prior to this but carried a heavy performance hit and so most gamers opted not to enable these features.
With these new technologies game engines featured seamlessly integrated indoor/outdoor environments, used shaders for more realistic animations (characters, water, weather effects, etc.), and generally increased realism. The fact that the GPU performed some of the tasks that were already done by the CPU, and more generally the increasing processing power available, allowed to add realistic physics effects to the games, for example with the inclusion of the Havok physics engine in most video games. Physics had been already added in a video game in 1998 with &quot;Jurassic Park: Trespasser&quot;, but limited hardware capabilities at the time, and the absence of a middleware like Havok to handle physics had made it a technical and commercial failure.

id Tech 4, first used for &quot;Doom 3&quot; (2004), used an entirely dynamic per-pixel lighting, whereas previously, 3D engines had relied primarily on pre-calculated per-vertex lighting or lightmaps and Gouraud shading. The Shadow volume approach used in &quot;Doom 3&quot; permitted more realistic lighting and shadows, but this came at a price as it could not render soft shadows, and the engine was primarily good indoors. This was later rectified to work with vast outdoor spaces, with the introduction of MegaTexture technology in the id Tech 4 engine.

The same year, Valve released &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, powered by their new Source engine. This new engine was notable in that, among other things, it had very realistic facial animations for NPCs, including what was described as an impressive lip-syncing technology.

===Late 2000s: The approach to Photorealism===
Further improvements in GPUs like Shader Model 3 and Shader Model 4, made possible by new graphic chipsets as GeForce 7 or Radeon X1xxx series, allowed for improvements in graphic effects.

Developers of this era of 3D engines often tout their increasingly photorealistic quality. Around the same time, esports were beginning to gain attention. These engines include realistic shader-based materials with predefined physics, environments with procedural and vertex shader-based objects (vegetation, debris, human-made objects such as books or tools), procedural animation, cinematographic effects (depth of field, motion blur, etc.), high-dynamic-range rendering, and unified lighting models with soft shadowing and volumetric lighting.

However, most of engines capable of these effects are evolutions of engines from the previous generation, such as Unreal Engine 3, the Dunia Engine and CryEngine 2, id Tech 5 (which was used with &quot;Rage&quot; and makes use of the new Virtual Texturing technology).

The first games using Unreal Engine 3 were released in November 2006, and the first game to use CryEngine 2 (&quot;Crysis&quot;) was released in 2007.

===Early 2010s: Graphic technique mixes===
Further improvements in GPUs like Shader Model 5, made possible by new graphic chipsets as GeForce 400 series or Radeon HD 5000 series and later, allowed for improvements in graphic effects. such as Dynamic Displacement Mapping and Tessellation.

As of 2010, two upcoming evolutions of major existing engines had been released: Unreal Engine 3 in DirectX 11 which powered Samaritan Demo (which is used with &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and more DX11 based UE3 games) and CryEngine 3, which powers &quot;Crysis 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.

Few companies had discussed future plans for their engines; id Tech 6, the eventual successor to id Tech 5, was an exception. Preliminary information about this engine which was still in early phases of development tended to show that id Software was looking toward a direction where ray tracing and classic raster graphics would be mixed. However, according to John Carmack, the hardware capable of id Tech 6 did not yet exist. The first title using the engine, &quot;Doom&quot;, was released in mid 2016.

In September 2015, Valve released Source 2 in an update to &quot;Dota 2&quot;.

<text>Kingston Maurward House is a large Grade I listed Georgian English country house set in a 750-acre (3 square km) estate in Dorset situated in the Frome valley two miles east of Dorchester.

==History==
There has been a manor house at Kingston since the late 14th century, replaced in the late 16th century with a manor house which is still in the grounds. The present mansion was built by George Pitt (1663-1735) of Stratfield Saye House, cousin of William Pitt the Elder, between 1717 and 1720 on the estate brought to him by his second wife Lora daughter of Audley Grey. The mansion was in red brick, but after derogatory comments from King George III, Pitt clad the house in Portland limestone. The building faces south, and has a projecting central section. The north facade is similar in design with the addition of a 20th-century porch. Much of the house is now used by Kingston Maurward College, though some of it is used for private functions.

In 2016, the house was flooded after a pipe burst above the house&#x27;s main hall. The consultants brought in to assess the damage discovered that the room had been redecorated and was designed to use white and stone to accent the mouldings. The discovery led to a restoration to its original form.

==Grounds and gardens==

The grounds of Kingston Maurward, which are used for the land-based college, are open to the public and include the farm areas and extensive gardens. Both the house and grounds are owned by Kingston Maurward College. Also in the grounds is Kingston Maurward Manor House, built in 1590, an earlier mansion which was narrowly saved from demolition when the estate was acquired. Following refurbishment it is a private residence.

The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

<doc id="1129479" wikidata="Q7552798" url="?curid=1129479" title="Sociolismo">
<text>Sociolismo (&quot;partner-ism&quot;), also known as amiguismo (&quot;friend-ism&quot;), is the informal term used in Cuba to describe the reciprocal exchange of favors by individuals, usually relating to circumventing bureaucratic restrictions or obtaining hard-to-find goods.

==Overview==
It comes from the Spanish word &quot;socio&quot; which means business partner or buddy, and is a pun on the official government policy of &quot;socialismo&quot; (socialism). It is analogous to the &quot;blat&quot; of the Soviet Union or the term &quot;combina&quot; in Israel. It is a form of corruption in Cuba.

The term is particularly associated with the black market economy, and perceived cronyism in Cuba&#x27;s state controlled command economy. &quot;Socios&quot; can be black market operators who &quot;facilitate&quot; (steal) goods that are officially reserved for the state. They can also get someone a job or obtain paperwork.

The system is used by anyone who needs to send an e-mail or print a resume but does not have a computer, or needs paint or cement but has no access to an Office Store or Home Improvement Store. Gary Marx, the Chicago Tribune&#x27;s Havana correspondent, reports the system works this way: Cubans send out signals they need something, make telephone calls and visit neighbors and friends to find the right person who can get things in motion.

Few people own cars and the buses, or &quot;camellos&quot;, are slow and overcrowded; many Cubans spend hours each day arranging rides to get to work, school or accomplish a task. People often must reach out and secure what they need &quot;por fuera&quot; (&quot;through the outside&quot;) or &quot;por la izquierda&quot; (&quot;through the left&quot;), slang terms that mean &quot;outside the official system&quot;.

The system has different levels and obligations. Friends, neighbors and relatives do favors for each other without expecting anything in return. But with lesser-known acquaintances, exchange is more normal for such things as shampoo, a piece of chicken, fruit, or cash.

Sometimes the favors extend to hundreds of people. Employees of a state company in Pinar del Río were given special treatment at a local hospital in exchange for paper, pens and other scarce materials and services.

&quot;Sociolismo&quot; lets any person with control over some resource exchange access to the resource for some current or future personal material benefit. Complex networks of reciprocal obligations thus became an important part of the functioning of the Cuban economy.

Daily life involves maintaining the personal relationships necessary to ensure access to necessary goods and services, through unofficial channels, or through official channels but by unofficial means. Though the term became prominent during the economic downturn known as the Special Period in Cuba, usage has continued into the mid-2000s.

Aspects of Cuban sociolismo were exported to the United States via Cuban immigrants, who relied on friends and relatives in their new country for help in finding jobs, since they were not able to verify their skills or employment in Cuba. This was particularly prevalent in the largest Cuban-American community, in Florida.

<text>The Scottish Bus Group (SBG) was a state-owned group of bus operators covering the whole of mainland Scotland.

The origin of the grouping was the operators owned by and including the Scottish Motor Traction company, which were transferred to Scottish Omnibuses after nationalisation in 1948 under control of the British Transport Commission. Highland Omnibuses was added to the group in 1952.

A new holding company, Scottish Omnibuses Group (Holdings) was formed in 1961, and this was renamed Scottish Bus Group in 1963. Meanwhile, the group had come under control of the Transport Holding Company in 1962 when the British Transport Commission was wound up. It went on to become part of the Scottish Transport Group on 1 January 1969 along with David MacBrayne. At the time it operated 4,700 buses.

In May 1988, it was decided to privatise the operating companies with this occurring in 1990/91. Central Scottish and Kelvin Scottish were merged as Kelvin Central Buses, while Clydeside Scottish was merged into Western Scottish so as to provide a healthier prospect for potential buyers, both companies ended up being sold as separate entities.

SBG Engineering had been formed to operate the central repair workshops inherited from six of the original seven operating subsidiaries (Alexander (Northern) not having had a separate engineering works). The company undertook heavy overhauls, refurbishment and accident repairs on behalf of the operating subsidiaries, and also offered these services commercially to other operators. Latterly it also owned a small fleet of rental buses. The Larbert works was transferred to Midland Scottish in 1988 and the rest of the company was dissolved in March 1990 as a prelude to privatisation. Edinburgh and Motherwell works were closed, while Inverness, Kilmarnock and Kirkcaldy works were transferred to Highland Scottish, Western Scottish and Fife Scottish respectively

The holding company, Scottish Bus Group Limited, was dissolved in 2006.

<text>Avon Technologies plc is a British company that specialises in the engineering and manufacturing of respiratory protection equipment for military, law enforcement and fire personnel. Its corporate headquarters are south of Melksham in Wiltshire, England, at the Hampton Park West development. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

==History==
The business was established when a former cloth mill, known as Avon Mill, on the banks of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke in Wiltshire, was acquired by Messrs E G Browne and J C Margetson in 1885. The previous owners of the site had been timber merchants but had diversified into rubber goods.
By 1890, the business had transferred to premises in Melksham and was named The Avon India Rubber Company Limited. Products at this time included solid tyres, conveyor belts and components for railways. By 1900, pneumatic tyres for bicycles were being produced, and by 1906 the first car tyres were advertised under the Avon brand. The company acquired the Sirdar Rubber Works at Greenland Mill in Bradford on Avon in 1915.

The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1933. It acquired the rival company of George Spencer, Moulton &amp; Co. in 1956, bringing with it Abbey Mills and Kingston Mills in Bradford on Avon, and a jointly owned plant in Paris. The company name was shortened to Avon Rubber in 1963.

In June 1958, an advertisement appeared in the British Sub-Aqua Club journal &quot;Triton&quot; to publicise the &quot;Typhoon dry diving suit manufactured by the Avon India Rubber Co. Ltd. exclusively for E. T. Skinner Co. Ltd.&quot;. For many years, Avon Rubber also produced back-entry dry diving suits for military use. The company also moulded lined &quot;Stonehenge&quot; brand wellington boots at a time when such footwear was manufactured by calendering or dipping processes.

Production started on a range of inflatable boats in 1959. In 1994 the Llanelli-based marine business Avon Inflatables was split-off and sold; it subsequently became a division of Zodiac Marine, France.

In 1997 the Avon Tyres business was sold to Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company of Findlay, Ohio in the United States, leaving the company to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products and protective equipment.

In March 2000, Avon moved its activities to a manufacturing and head office facility at Hampton Park West, south of Melksham.

In June 2005, Avon purchased International Safety Instruments, Inc., based in Lawrenceville, Georgia, USA. Avon-ISI is a manufacturer of self-contained breathing apparatus and thermal imaging systems for fire, law enforcement and industrial applications.

In August 2006, the Avon Automotive division was sold to a US-based management team and became a separate entity called Avon Automotive Holdings Inc.; this was the largest buy-out in the company&#x27;s history. The aerosol division was sold for £1.75 million in March 2008 to Avon Group (an unrelated Bristol-based company), enabling Avon Rubber to concentrate on its core protective equipment, dairy and extrusions markets.

In November 2008, the mixing plant at Westbury was sold to ATR Compounding Ltd, a division of SPC UK, a compounder of rubber based in Whitby.

The company, which had a long history of manufacturing respirators – including the S6 NBC Respirator, a gas mask used by the British armed forces from the 1960s, and the S10 from the 1980s – began to supply the M50 mask to United States forces in 2009.

In January 2020, Avon purchased Ceradyne, Inc.&#x27;s advanced ballistic protection business and the Ceradyne brand from 3M.

In September 2020, the company divested its milking equipment business, milkrite | InterPuls, to DeLaval for net proceeds of around £160 million. This enabled the company to concentrate on personal protection, both respiratory and ballistic, under the Avon Protection brand. Shortly after, they acquired Team Wendy, a maker of helmets for military and first responder use, for a reported $130million.

The company changed its name from Avon Rubber to Avon Protection in July 2021.

In December 2021, the company announced it would be closing its body armour business after its bullet-proof vests failed US regulatory tests.

In April 2022 the company warned that the year&#x27;s profits would miss City forecasts, leading to a share price drop of nearly 20 per cent over the course of a single day.

In August 2024 the company changed its name from Avon Protection to Avon Technologies.

<doc id="1129509" wikidata="Q462067" url="?curid=1129509" title="Amen Corner (band)">
<text>Amen Corner were a Welsh rock group formed in Cardiff, Wales. They are best known for their hits &quot;Bend Me, Shape Me&quot; (1968), &quot;High in the Sky&quot; (1968) and the chart-topper &quot;(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice&quot; (1969).

==Career==

=== History ===
The band, formed in late 1966, was named after The Amen Corner, a weekly disc spin at the Victoria Ballroom (later to become The Scene Club) in Cardiff, Wales, where every Sunday night Dr. Rock would play soul music from the United States.

Initially they specialised in a blues and jazz-oriented style, but were steered by their record labels towards a more commercial sound. Their first hit was a rendition of &quot;Gin House Blues&quot;. Their first singles and album appeared on Decca&#x27;s subsidiary label, Deram, but they left at the end of 1968 to join Immediate,
for which they had a No. 1, &quot;(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice&quot; in early 1969, followed by another Top 5 entry with the Roy Wood composition, &quot;Hello Susie&quot;.

After recording a final studio album, &quot;Farewell to the Real Magnificent Seven&quot;, they put out a single with a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; as their swansong. They disbanded by the end of 1969. The band also appeared as themselves in the 1969 horror film, &quot;Scream and Scream Again&quot;, singing the film&#x27;s eponymous theme song.

=== Members later careers ===
Whilst saxophone player Allan Jones went on to form Judas Jump, guitarist and vocalist Andy Fairweather Low led Dennis Bryon (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into a new band, Fair Weather. The band scored a UK No. 6 hit with &quot;Natural Sinner&quot; in 1970 and recorded one album before disbanding after Weaver left to join The Strawbs a year later.

Fairweather Low went on to a successful solo career in the 1970s, notably with the Top 10 hit &quot;Wide Eyed and Legless&quot; (1975); he became a regular player with Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Roger Waters. Weaver joined The Strawbs as Rick Wakeman&#x27;s replacement and after a successful 1974 tour with Mott the Hoople, went on to join the Bee Gees, where Dennis Bryon was now the drummer. Weaver also played keyboards for many artists as a session player and later Fairlight programmer.

Saxophonist player Allan Jones went on to manage L.A. Guns from 1986 to 1991.

Mike Smith, who married Linda Carter in 1970 and added her surname to his, invented the &quot;Good Night Ring&quot;, a ring worn during sleep to reduce heavy snoring.

Amen Corner&#x27;s Decca back catalogue has been re-issued as part of the &quot;Collection&quot; series, and their Immediate work (including their singles, live album and material recorded for an unreleased studio album) has been released on &quot;If Paradise Was Half as Nice: The Immediate Anthology&quot;.

Neil Jones died on 8 June 2018 aged 70. Dennis Bryon died on 14 November 2024 aged 75.

<text>Ethel Lynn Beers (born Ethelinda Eliot; January 13, 1827 – October 11, 1879) was an American poet best known for her patriotic and sentimental Civil War poem &quot;All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight&quot;.

==Biography==
Ethelinda Eliot was born in Goshen, New York on January 13, 1827. She was a descendant of Puritan missionary John Eliot. When she began writing and publishing, she signed her name as &quot;Ethel Lynn&quot; because she thought her last name was too &quot;tame and commonplace&quot;. At age 19, she married William H. Beers and appended her married name to her poems. Her most famous poem, &quot;All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight&quot;, first appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on November 30, 1861, under the title &quot;The Picket Guard&quot;. 

Her poems — including other notable works like &quot;Weighing the Baby&quot;, &quot;Which Shall It Be?&quot;, and &quot;Baby Looking Out For Me&quot; — appeared in many publications, most frequently the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;. In 1863 she published &quot;General Frankie: a Story for Little Folks&quot;. She feared publishing her collected works as she thought she would die after its publication, a premonition which came true. The day after the publication of &quot;All Quiet Along the Potomac and Other Poems&quot;, she died in Orange, New Jersey, aged 52.

<text>Ant Banks (born Anthony Banks, May 16, 1969), is an American record producer and rapper from Oakland, California.

==Biography==

Anthony Banks was born in Oakland, California on May 16, 1969. In band lessons at school, he learned to play classical music on a variety of instruments, while teaching himself how to play funk at home on his digital keyboard from bands like Parliament, Funkadelic, and The Gap Band.

Banks went on to produce mixtapes with his friend, Oakland rapper MC Ant, and sell them out of the trunk of their car at their high school. The tapes quickly gained popularity for the duo.

In 1987, Banks, MC Ant, and other friends recorded MC Ant&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Great&quot;, released through Raw Dog Records in 1989. Banks also recorded California rapper Spice 1&#x27;s debut album &quot;Let It Be Known&quot;, released in 1991 through Triad Records. This production debut, combined with releases from Pooh-Man and Dangerous Dame sold over 100,000 units without record label or promotion, launching Banks into a prominent figure in the early 1990s Bay Area hip hop scene. He went on to produce songs for Too Short, E-40, Snoop Dogg, and 3X Krazy. In 1993, he engaged in a beef with Oakland rapper Pooh-Man. 

In 1994, Banks released &quot;The Big Badass&quot;, an album inspired by his nickname. In 1996, he appeared on &quot;America Is Dying Slowly&quot;, a compilation CD focused on raising awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African-American men released by the Red Hot Organization, also featuring Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe.

In 1999, Banks started the group T.W.D.Y. (&quot;The Whole Damn Yay&quot;), with Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay and Captain Save&#x27;m, releasing their debut album &quot;Derty Werk&quot;, containing the single &quot;Player&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, featuring Too Short, Mac Mall, and Otis &amp; Shug. The album also marked the end of Banks&#x27; beef with Pooh-Man with the two appearing together on the track &quot;Ride Wit&#x27; Me&quot;. In 2000, T.W.D.Y released their second and final album, &quot;Lead the Way&quot;, before Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay left the group and was replaced by Dolla Will.

His talent for producing basslines is well-known and has achieved cross-over appreciation in the techno genre. The album liner for Daft Punk&#x27;s album &quot;Homework&quot; gives a note of appreciation to Ant Banks for inspiration.

<doc id="1129533" wikidata="Q6413602" url="?curid=1129533" title="Kingston Russell House">
<text>Kingston Russell House is a large mansion house and manor near Long Bredy in Dorset, England, west of Dorchester. The present house dates from the late 17th century but in 1730 was clad in a white Georgian stone facade. The house was restored in 1913, and at the same time the gardens were laid out.

==Location==
The house is on land which was granted to the Russell family (previously thought not ancestors of the Russell Dukes of Bedford), by an early king, probably John, King of England (reigned 1199–1216) at the end of his reign, or his son Henry III of England. Kingston Russell manor is now part of Long Bredy parish, but earlier appears to have had its own church. The main part of the manor adjoins Winterbourne Abbas to the east and Compton Valence to the north, whilst the house itself adjoins Long Bredy. It is situated in an area known for ancient tumuli and the Kingston Russell Stone Circle. The Poor Lot barrow group forms a boundary with Littlebredy and Winterbourne Abbas.

==Toponymy==
The &quot;Victoria County History of the County of Dorset&quot; (1908) notes that Little Bredy, of which Kingston Russell is a part, may have been the borough of &quot;Brydian&quot; in the Saxon period. It goes on to say that if Little Bredy is indeed the borough of Brydian then &quot;It was ... important as guarding the one gap in the downs which connects south-east with south-west Dorset.&quot;

==The Russell family==

Kingston Russell takes the second part of its name from the Russell family who were granted the manor for their service to the King. The manor was held in-chief from the King by Grand Serjeanty, the particular service performed for the King was originally as Marshal of the Buttery, as the entry in the Book of Fees dated 1211 records for the Hundred of &quot;Alvredesberge&quot; (since dissolved), Dorset:

The serjeanty changed during the minority of King Henry III to the counting of the King&#x27;s chessman and storing them away after a game. John Russell of Kingston Russell was a household knight of King Richard I from at the latest 1195 then also of his brother King John and then of his infant son King Henry III, of whose household he became steward. In the capacity of Household Knight he acted as part of the backbone of the king&#x27;s army, as a temporary castellan, sheriff, diplomat and general trouble-shooter. He thus served as Constable of Sherborne Castle, and Governor of Corfe Castle, both in Dorset. He undertook an important diplomatic assignment in 1220 to recover Princess Joan, infant sister of Henry III, from the court of Hugh X of Lusignan to whom she had been betrothed and by whom then rejected. Russell died in 1224. He married Rose Bardolph, da. of Thomas Bardolph and widow of Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of the large barony of Berry Pomeroy in Devon, consisting of 32 knight&#x27;s fees. The marriage to this widow of a tenant-in-chief was likely to have been a reward from the king for Russell&#x27;s services, and brought Russell a life-interest in her large dower lands. John Russell was granted as a further royal mark of gratitude the marriage of one of the heiresses of James de Newmarch, feudal baron of North Cadbury, who had died in 1216 without male heir, leaving 2 infant heiresses, whose marriages became the property of the king by feudal custom. The wardship of the eldest daughter Isabelle was granted by King John to John Russell, who married her to his eldest surviving (3rd.) son Ralph, the marriage of the other daughter Hawise having been acquired by John de Bottrell/Bottreux. The Newmarch lands were thus split in half, one moiety consisting of nearly 17 knight&#x27;s fees, in Gloucestershire (including Dyrham), Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Berkshire going to the Russells, with the second half, including the &quot;caput&quot; of North Cadbury, being confirmed to Bottrell by Henry III in 1218, per the Close Rolls. Sir Ralph Russell continued to hold Kingston Russell from Henry III by Grand Serjeanty, viz &quot;that he should present a cup of beer to our Sovereign Lord the King on the 4 principal feasts of the year&quot; Sir Ralph Russell and Isabel&#x27;s heir was Sir William Russell (1257–1311), Constable of Carisbrook Castle, Isle of Wight. He married Katherine de Aula, heiress of Yaverland, Isle of Wight (and possibly later Jane Peverell). On 12 July 1284 William was granted by King Edward I (1272–1307) a market and free warren as the following entry in the Charter Rolls records:

William died before his son and heir Theobald (1301–1340) had reached his majority of 21, and the infant Theobald was granted in wardship to Ralph III de Gorges, 1st Baron Gorges (d.1224) of Knighton, Isle of Wight and Wraxall, Somerset. Gorges married off the young Theobald to his 2nd daughter Eleanor. Gorge&#x27;s son, Ralph IV, 2nd. Baron Gorges, found himself without his own male heir, with only three sisters as heiresses to his ancient and noble line. He thus made his nephew Theobald II Russell his heir, apparently with the provision that he should change his name to Gorges, bear the ancient Gorges armorials and inherit the bulk of the Gorges lands, including Wraxall, Somerset, 6 miles west of Bristol. Theobald Russell &quot;Gorges&quot; thus established a new line of Gorges at Wraxall, where the family became well established (see Sir Ferdinando Gorges). The eldest son of Theobald and Eleanor was Ralph (1319–1375), the second son being Theobald, who duly adopted the name Gorges and inherited his mother&#x27;s lands at Wraxall and Bradpole, Dorset. Ralph his elder brother had as his heir Sir Maurice Russell (c.1352-1416) of Dyrham, Gloucestershire. To the latter, whose funerary brass can be seen at Dyrham Church, descended Kingston Russell, the manor and hundred of Redhove (Redhone) and Beminster Forum (Beaminster) in the manor of Bradpole, as well as the manor of Dyrham, Gloucestershire and Horsington, Somerset. By his first wife Isabel Childrey he had two daughters who on the death of his son Thomas in 1432 from his second marriage to Joan Dauntsey, became his co-heiresses. Margaret Russell (d. 1466) the eldest daughter had married firstly her father&#x27;s neighbour Sir Gilbert Denys of Siston and thus Kingston Russell and Dyrham passed to the Denys family. The Denyses appear never to have lived at Kingston Russell.

==Heritage of Dukes of Bedford==

Recent unverified research by Ancestry.com shows that Sir Theobald Russell (b. 1301) in North Cadbury, Somerset, England, and died (1340) was a direct ancestor of John Russell the first Earl of Bedford. Sir Theobald married Eleanor de Gorges on 1318. They had six children, Ralph (b. 1319), William (b. 1321), Theobald (b. 1323), John (b. 1325) Richard (b. 1327) and Elizabeth (b. 1330). Eleanor de Gorges was born on 1302 in Wraxall, Somerset, England, and died 1332/1333 on the Isle of Wight, Hampshire, England.

Sir Theobald Russell married Eleanor de la Tour (b. 1313 in Berwick, Dorset, England) in 1334. They had one child, William (b. 1335). William married NN. de Muschamp on 1362 in Kingston-Russell, Dorset. NN. de Muschamp the daughter and heiress of Muschamp was born in 1342 at Kingston Russell. They had one son Henry Russell born in 1363 at Kingston Russell. Henry Russell married NN. Godfrey in 1389 and their son John Russell (born in 1390) was the grandfather of a later John Russell, the first Earl of Bedford. 
==Modern times==
===Early modern period===
At some point possibly around the 1640s, part of the manor, including the house, came into the possession of the Michel family, who partly rebuilt the seventeenth century Kingston Russell House as it still stands today at the end of a long driveway. The Michel family also owned Dewlish House in Dewlish, Dorset and removed there sometime during the 1760s when the house was then let. Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, Nelson&#x27;s flag captain, was born at Kingston Russell on 5 April 1769, his mother being the daughter of Thomas Masterman of this place.

==Victorian and Edwardian eras==
At some time before 1861 the Dukes of Bedford bought Kingston Russell for a second time, and when Lord John Russell (1792–1878) the prominent Liberal statesman, 3rd son of the 6th Duke of Bedford, was raised to the peerage as an earl on 30 July 1861, he chose the title Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, which title is still extant (the famous philosopher Bertrand Russell was the third earl of this title). In 1877, the famous American historian, John Lothrop Motley, author of &#x27;The Rise of the Dutch Republic&#x27;, died at Kingston Russell. 

By the turn of the twentieth century however, the house was in a dilapidated condition and the estate was sold in 1913 to George Gribble. He and his wife Norah Royds had previously renovated Henlow Grange. The new owners - with architect Philip Tilden, who later worked for Winston Churchill - demolished a stub wing from the older Tudor building, extended the Carolean/Georgian wing by the addition of two small three-storey wings at either end of the original two-storey structure, and laid out the gardens. Their son Julian Royds Gribble won the Victoria Cross in the First World War, but died in a prisoner of war camp in 1918; the village hall was constructed as a gift to the village, in memory of him. The Gribble family moved away in the 1920s. 

==Present day==
Since then, the house has had a number of different owners. Since 1984 it has been owned by Dr H. H. J. Carter &amp; Miss T. Silkstone, who are the longest continuous owner-occupiers of the house since the 1760s. The house is not open to the public, though it has welcomed visitors from bodies such as the Georgian Group.

==Chapel of St. James==

A small chapel dedicated to St. James once stood nearby. It is reputed to have been built by the Russells and was financed by them through tithes and the glebe in Pitcombe. The last rector of the chapel was Roger Bond who was appointed to it, along with Little Bredy in 1531. The inhabitants then used the church at Long Bredy for burials. After its closure it was leased variously. In 1565 it was granted to Edith Cole, widow and John and Joan Martin, her children for their lives. It was then granted to John, Henry and William Mintern for their lives from 1585, then in 1605 to Fenton, esq. captain of the guard, and 1607 to George Ward. The chapel of St James then came to the Mellers of Little Bredy who sold the tithes and part of the glebe to the Michels. By this time the chapel was in ruins and in John Hutchins&#x27;s time only the walls remained. During the time of the Michels residence of the manor, according to Hutchins, it was inhabited by poor people.

<text>Central Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group formed in June 1985 from Central SMT, and operated until July 1989 when it was merged with Kelvin Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses.

==Operation==
From its head office in Traction House, Motherwell, Central Scottish had an operating area covering the whole of Lanarkshire, bounded by Glasgow to the west, Airdrie to the north, Strathaven to the south and Shotts to the east.

Central was the largest operator in central Scotland and was responsible for local and interurban services in the towns of East Kilbride, Airdrie, Motherwell, Wishaw and Hamilton. Depots were also located in these towns.

Central Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink work, mainly from Glasgow and central Scotland to other points in Scotland.

==History==
Scottish Motor Traction (SMT) was founded in Edinburgh in 1905, and expanded rapidly. After World War I, this expansion included the acquisition of bus companies operating in other parts of Scotland. In 1928 SMT was purchased by the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) and the London &amp; North Eastern Railway, and became the parent company for railway-owned bus operations in Scotland. Central SMT was a product of this series of acquisitions and mergers.

In 1926 the Glasgow General Omnibus and Motor Services Ltd. was formed. This company, which traded as the &#x27;Glasgow Omnibus Company&#x27; (GOC) developed a network of bus services radiating out from Glasgow into Lanarkshire, as well as an isolated group of services along the north bank of the River Clyde to western Dunbartonshire. In 1930, GOC was purchased by the LMS. In the same year, the LMS. also purchased two further major Lanarkshire bus firms, Stewart and McDonald of Carluke, and JW &amp; R Torrance of Hamilton. Several smaller firms were subsequently purchased and absorbed by these companies.

In 1932, control of the LMS&#x27; bus interests in Scotland was vested in the SMT Group. The three Lanarkshire firms were merged into one new company, named the Central SMT Company Ltd. At the same time, the SMT Group purchased the Lanarkshire Traction Company Ltd., of Motherwell. Lanarkshire Traction, which had originally been a tramway operator, became a subsidiary of Central SMT. The head office of both companies was the former Lanarkshire Traction premises at Traction House, Motherwell. Throughout the 1930s, Central purchased and absorbed numerous smaller companies, notable amongst which were Baillie Brothers of Dumbarton and Clydebank Motors of Clydebank. These two firms were acquired in 1936, which strengthened the company&#x27;s position in western Dunbartonshire.

Nationalisation of the railways in 1948 made the state the major shareholder in the SMT group of companies, and the group was itself fully nationalised in 1949. At that time, some of the group&#x27;s smaller subsidiaries were wound up, including Lanarkshire Traction, which was fully absorbed by Central SMT. By this time, Central was firmly established as the dominant bus operator in Lanarkshire and western Dunbartonshire. This dominant position was furthered by the takeover of John Laurie and Company of Hamilton in 1961. During this period, Central was consistently the most profitable company in the Scottish Bus Group. From the late 1970s, the trading name of the company became &#x27;Central Scottish&#x27;.

In preparation for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and the eventual break up and privatisation of the group, the Scottish Bus Group restructured its subsidiary companies in 1985. As part of this, Central SMT was renamed Central Scottish Omnibuses. The Dunbartonshire and north Glasgow operations became part of a new company, Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses., but Central gained the former Eastern Scottish operations in the Monklands area of Lanarkshire.

On deregulation Central, together with fellow SBG subsidiaries Clydeside Scottish and Kelvin Scottish, launched a revised network of services within the city of Glasgow in direct competition with the city operator, Strathclyde Buses. A high profile, high frequency cross city service, together with a number of minibus services were started, though Strathclyde Buses retaliated by extending their own network deep into Lanarkshire. Whereas Strathclyde Buses services into East Kilbride and beyond proved popular at Central&#x27;s expense, Central&#x27;s city services failed to gain popularity and often ran empty.

In the face of growing competition, it was announced that Central Scottish would be merged with Kelvin Scottish in an attempt to make the larger company more attractive to potential buyers. However, the planned merger was deeply unpopular with Central&#x27;s staff, as flexible rostering agreements, fully in place with Kelvin, had not yet been implemented at Central. This resulted in a disastrous strike in early 1989, and the company&#x27;s network was paralysed for weeks on end. While Central&#x27;s buses remained in their depots, Strathclyde Buses and a number of independent operators stepped in and took over much of the company&#x27;s route network. By summer 1989, the dispute had ended, and in a vain attempt to win back customers, Central embarked on a major rebranding exercise. The Central Scottish trading name and the deep red and cream livery the vehicles wore gave way to a number of new local identities. Vehicles in Airdrie received a dark blue and grey colour scheme branded as Monklands Bus, East Kilbride vehicles gained a dark green and cream livery with EK Chieftain fleetnames, leaving vehicles in the remaining depots gaining a more vibrant red and cream livery, branded as Lanarkshire Bus. The Central Scottish identity was buried with the strike action, and the company was renamed Kelvin Central Buses in preparation for the merger. However, a significant retrenchment of the company&#x27;s operations followed.

In July 1989, the merger between the two companies was fully enacted, and Central Scottish ceased trading as an independent concern. Kelvin Central Buses was later privatised by sale to its employees, who later sold the firm to Strathclyde Buses, before it in turn was purchased by First Glasgow. However, many of the former Central routes have been surrendered to independent operators. The last remaining former Central garage, Airbles in Motherwell, closed in 2007.

==Depots and works==
Central SMT and Central Scottish operated from the following depots:

* Airbles depot, Motherwell (opened 1962, closed by First Glasgow 2007 when replaced by a new facility in Blantyre);
* Burnbank depot, Hamilton (closed 1962, replaced by Airbles)
* Carluke depot (closed in 1976)
* Clarkston depot, Airdrie (ex Scottish Omnibuses in 1985, closed by First Glasgow);
* Clydesdale depot, Hamilton (closed April 1988)
* East Kilbride (original small depot replaced by a new depot in 1956, once SBG&#x27;s most profitable depot, but closed by Kelvin Central Buses in December 1990);
* Gavinburn depot, Old Kilpatrick (opened 1936 to replace various small outstations, passed to Kelvin Scottish 1985, closed by Kelvin Central Buses May 1996)
* Harthill depot (closed in 1962 as part of a minor re-organisation of services between Central SMT and Scottish Omnibuses);
* Muirkirk depot (a small outstation of Carluke, closed in the 1970s)
* Traction House, Motherwell (replaced as depot by neighbouring Airbles in 1962, but retained as head office and central works. Closed by Kelvin Central Buses);
* Wishaw (closed by Kelvin Central Buses December 1990)

==The fleet==
At its formation in 1932, Central SMT inherited a varied collection of vehicles. However, Leyland quickly became the preferred supplier for new buses. Although there were also some Albions, new buses purchased in the 1930s mainly comprised Leyland Lion, Tiger and Titan models, including a number of secondhand Titans. During World War II, when Leylands were not available, the fleet received a rare (for Scotland) Bristol K, as well as the ubiquitous utility Guy Arabs and Daimler CWs.

Between the end of the war and the early 1960s, Central overwhelmingly favoured double deckers. Some pre-war Leyland Tigers were rebodied as such in the late 1940s (notably including some 3-axle Tiger TS7T chassis which were rebuilt to 2-axle Titan TD4 specification). New Leyland Titans continued to be bought until 1960, but the first Bristol Lodekkas arrived in 1955 and soon became the preferred choice, the last new examples being delivered in 1967. Other double deckers bought in this period were a solitary AEC Regent in 1946, some Guy Arab IIIs in 1951–52, and Albion Lowlanders in 1962–63. The takeover of Laurie of Hamilton brought an assortment of Leyland Titans (including former London Transport RTLs), and a rebodied Guy Arab, but most notable were a pair of early Leyland Atlanteans. These were the first rear-engined double deckers to operate for the Scottish Bus Group.

Central tried various types, of rear engined double deckers, but found that none were to their satisfaction, and double deckers declined as a proportion of the fleet. The Atlanteans were sold in 1969, and a prototype Bristol VRX, operated from 1966, was returned to the manufacturer when a batch of 20 Bristol VRTs arrived, also in 1969. The VRT was not popular in Scottish Bus Group fleets, and all were sold to the National Bus Company in exchange for late-model Lodekkas in the early 1970s. A batch of 35 Daimler Fleetlines was delivered in 1971, but these were exchanged for single deck Leyland Leopards from other SBG companies in 1975. However, Volvo Ailsa B55s (30 purchased in 1978–79) and Dennis Dominators (51 in 1978–83) eventually found favour. When Central inherited Scottish Omnibuses&#x27; Airdrie operations in 1985, the Fleetlines and Leyland Olympians based there were not wanted by Central and were retained by Eastern Scottish. However, the last double deckers purchased by Central were in fact 10 Leyland Olympians, delivered in 1986.

Relatively few single deckers were purchased in the 1940s and 1950s. There were Leyland Tigers and Guy Arab IIIs in the late 1940s/early 1950s, followed by some Guy Arab UFs. The first Leyland Leopards first arrived in 1961, but a milestone was the delivery of the first batch of Leopard PSU3 models in 1964. With 53 seats, a standee Leopard had almost as many seats as an early-postwar double decker, and they quickly became the standard Central SMT bus. By 1983 some 400 Leopards had been purchased new, as well as a number of secondhand examples from within the SBG. After the Leopards, Central standardised on the Leyland Tiger, with 83 buses delivered between 1982 and 1987. There were also 45 Leyland Nationals in 1978-81 and 15 Dennis Dorchesters in 1983–84. Additional Leyland Nationals and some Seddon Pennine 7s were inherited with Airdrie depot.

A small dedicated coach fleet was maintained intermittently. Between 1955 until 1978 Bedfords with Duple coachwork were bought (along with five Albion Vikings in 1966, which were quickly transferred to Highland Omnibuses). The last Bedfords were sold in the early &#x27;80s, and for a time there were no coaches. However, in 1984 a secondhand Leyland Tiger coach and a former Western SMT Seddon Pennine 7 which had been fitted with a wheelchair lift arrived, and five of the Dennis Dorchesters delivered that year were to coach specification. A second Leyland Tiger coach was inherited from Scottish Omnibuses&#x27; Airdrie fleet, and some of the Airdrie Seddons also had coach bodywork. Two Volvo B10Ms were acquired from Newton of Dingwall in 1985, and 10 new Tigers coaches were bought in 1986–87.

A few minibuses were operated from the early 1970s onwards. These were successively Bedford VAS, Ford A-series and Leyland Cubs. In 1986–87, a fleet of 31 Dodge S56s were purchased for competitive services in the south of Glasgow.

Even within the Scottish Bus Group, Central had a reputation for conservatism in its vehicle specifications. Examples of this included:
* the specification of cutaway rear entrances on some of the underfloor-engined Guy Arab UFs, when front or central entrances were far more common for such buses;
* the continued purchase of PD1 model Leyland Titans after most other operators had switched to the more advanced PD2, and later of PD2 models when other SBG subsidiaries had gone over to the larger PD3 model;
* the early disposal of successive models of rear-engined double-deckers in the 1960s and 1970s;
* continuing to specify manual synchromesh gearboxes on its Leyland Leopards until 1979, by which time automatic gearboxes were the norm across most of the UK bus industry.

<text>Clydeside Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group formed in June 1985 from Western SMT Company Ltd. The company operated until May 1989, when it was remerged with Western Scottish, the successor company to Western SMT.

==Operation==
From its head office in Paisley, Clydeside Scottish covered an operating area bounded by Largs in the south, the River Clyde to the north and the south side of Glasgow to the east. The company also operated services on the Isle of Bute. It was the largest operator in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire and had depots in Rothesay, Largs, Greenock, Johnstone, Inchinnan, Paisley and Thornliebank in the south of Glasgow. Its fleet numbered 334 buses when formed. 

Clydeside Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink services between Gourock, Glasgow Airport, Glasgow and onward to Edinburgh.

==History==
Clydeside Scottish was one of the shortest lived of the &quot;new&quot; Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, lasting shortly under four years as a stand-alone company. Clydeside was created in preparation for the deregulation of the British bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group (SBG). A bright red and yellow livery was introduced for the fleet, and a fleet name displayed in a style different from the corporate SBG look.

On deregulation, the company launched a network of services in the city of Glasgow, competing against the city operator Strathclyde Buses. A large number of two-person operated open-platform AEC Routemaster buses were purchased from London Transport for these services, which gave the company the advantage of giving change (as opposed to the exact fare the city operator demanded) without the buses having to linger at bus stops. The Routemasters operated on services into Paisley, Renfrew and Johnstone. Strathclyde Buses retaliated against the competition, however, by introducing routes beyond the city boundary and into Clydeside&#x27;s operating territory.

A number of innovative marketing initiatives were introduced including ticketing, advertising, staff motivation and production of a story book &quot;Rodney The Routemaster comes to Town&quot; aimed at children.

While competing with the much larger Strathclyde Buses, Clydeside suffered an explosion of new operators in Paisley and in particular, Greenock. Clydeside found it increasingly difficult to compete against so many operators with much smaller operating costs. In May 1989 it was merged with Western Scottish. The Clydeside name was retained by Western as a trading name, but its red and yellow livery was replaced by Western black, white and red.

==Successor companies==
The former Clydeside operations, with the exception of those on Bute, passed to a new company, Clydeside 2000 plc, on the privatisation of Western Scottish in October 1991. Clydeside&#x27;s new management and employees took a 76% stake in the new company, with Luton &amp; District purchasing the remainder. The company scaled down its Glasgow operations, and the depots at Largs, Thornliebank and Paisley closed in the following three years. 

Clydeside 2000 was taken over by British Bus in November 1994 (Luton &amp; District had become part of British Bus a few months earlier); British Bus was subsequently acquired by the Cowie Group, later to become Arriva. Clydeside was renamed Arriva Scotland West, trading at the time as &quot;Arriva serving Scotland&quot;. Arriva expanded its Scottish operations with the purchase of McGill&#x27;s Bus Service of Barrhead and Ashton Coaches of Greenock, although the Greenock operations of Arriva Scotland West were later demerged and sold to local management as McGill&#x27;s Bus Services.

In December 2011 it was announced that Arriva had agreed a deal to sell its remaining Scottish operations to McGill&#x27;s. The sale was completed in March 2012.

<text>Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. was a bus and coach operator based in Edinburgh, Scotland and a subsidiary of the Scottish Bus Group (formerly SMT Group). Eastern Scottish was formed in June 1985 from the main part of Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., which had itself traded as &#x27;Eastern Scottish&#x27; since the 1960s. Following privatisation in 1990 the company traded as &#x27;SMT&#x27; reviving the original name of the company (Scottish Motor Traction). It operated until 1994, when it became part of GRT Bus Group plc.

==Operation==
From its head office on New Street, Edinburgh, Eastern Scottish had an operating area throughout the Lothians, in the east of Scotland, bounded by the Firth of Forth to the north and east, Fauldhouse in the west, and Gorebridge (Birkenside) in the south.

Eastern operated urban, interurban and rural services in and around Bathgate, Livingston, Dalkeith and Musselburgh, and services within the city of Edinburgh. Depots were also located in these towns.

Eastern was also active in the coaching business, operating day tours and private hires, as well as providing coaches for Scottish Citylink express from Edinburgh to Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, London and many other locations throughout Scotland and England.

==History==
The Scottish Motor Traction Company Ltd. (trading as &quot;SMT&quot;) was formed in 1905, and expanded quickly through a series of takeovers to become the principal bus operator in south east Scotland. By the 1930s SMT was also the parent company of the SMT Group, whose other subsidiaries operated buses elsewhere in Scotland. In 1949 the SMT Group&#x27;s bus operations were nationalised by transfer to a new British Transport Commission subsidiary, Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., although the SMT name remained in use until the early 1960s in the east, and was retained even longer in the Western SMT and Central SMT operating units of the Scottish Bus Group. 

Subsequently, &quot;Scottish Omnibuses&quot;, &quot;Scottish&quot;, and then &quot;Eastern Scottish&quot; fleetnames were used. The SMT name remained in Edinburgh parlance long after the change of fleet name, and survived on an unrelated car dealership showroom on Lothian Road, Edinburgh.
With nationalisation some rationalisation of SMT Group operations took place. The SMT Company&#x27;s isolated operations in the Dundee area did not pass to Scottish Omnibuses, but instead passed to sister company W. Alexander &amp; Sons Ltd.

In the Edinburgh area this history resulted in SMT/Eastern Scottish retaining the right to carry passengers within the city boundary (contrast Glasgow where only pickup outward and set-down inward were permitted). The cessation of tramway operation in Edinburgh (which at one time extended through Musselburgh to Port Seton) was accompanied by service reallocations, making Musselburgh exclusive to SMT/Eastern Scottish, and takeover of Gilmerton services by the corporation buses, albeit with competition from Eastern Scottish&#x27;s Birkenside and some Rosewell services. 

In 1958 Lowland Motorways of Glasgow was taken over, with various local services in the east side of the city. Another acquisition in the west of Scottish Omnibuses&#x27; territory was Baxter&#x27;s Bus Service of Airdrie in 1962, with local services in the Airdrie and Coatbridge areas. These purchases significantly increased the company&#x27;s presence in the Lanarkshire and Glasgow area. The final significant takeover was that of Stark&#x27;s Motor Service of Dunbar in 1964. Stark&#x27;s had operated some of its services jointly with Scottish Omnibuses for some years, and a proportion of its fleet was already painted in SMT livery.
When the Baxter&#x27;s business was acquired, adverse public reaction to the repainting of buses into Scottish Omnibuses livery led to a decision to retain the Baxter&#x27;s identity and blue livery for buses based at Victoria depot and used on town services around Airdrie and Coatbridge. The Stark&#x27;s livery, a lighter shade of green than that used by Scottish Omnibuses, was retained for buses at Dunbar and North Berwick. Both local identities disappeared in the late 1970s when the SBG&#x27;s new corporate fleetname style was introduced (&quot;Eastern SCOTTISH&quot;, with a saltire logo).

SMT and Scottish Omnibuses had long been a major operator of long-distance coach services, usually in cooperation with English operators such as Grey-Green, Midland Red and Ribble, using the Eastern Scottish fleetname and green/cream livery. Dual-purpose coaches were prefixed Z and carried a 50/50 green/cream livery, and tour coaches were prefixed Y and carried a majority cream livery. A marketing feature was the operation of 2 and 3 day tours between London and Edinburgh, available as single or return journeys. This business was supported by a permanent sales office in London, operated by Eastern Scottish-uniformed staff. 

A unique black/yellow livery on Bristol REMH vehicles serving Edinburgh-London in the 1970s. Western SMT, with fleetname Western Scottish, paralleled this service from Glasgow, using identical vehicles in a black/white livery. From the mid-1970s Scottish Bus Group policy increasingly saw such services operated with a corporate SBG identity rather than the individual names and liveries of the subsidiary operating companies. Initially, SBG coaches used on express services to London received a special blue and white livery with &quot;SCOTTISH&quot; branding; in the early 1980s most other express services were branded &quot;Scottish Citylink&quot; with a two-tone blue and yellow livery.

===Depots===
Depot codes were introduced in the 1930s. At the time of nationalisation the principal depots were:

*A Edinburgh (New Street)
*B Bathgate (Whitburn Road)
*C &quot;(formerly Dundee)&quot;
*D Galashiels (Duke Street)
*E Kelso (Roxburgh Street)
*F Linlithgow (High Street)
*G Dalkeith (High Street)
*H Clarkston Depot, Airdrie (Connor Street)
*I Broxburn (East Main Street)
*J Berwick-upon-Tweed (Marygate)
*K Peebles (Innerleithen Road)
*L &quot;(formerly Carlisle)&quot;
*W Musselburgh (Mall Avenue)

In addition to these there were several sub-depots in the Borders area, including Biggar (North Back Street), Hawick (Dovecote Street), Jedburgh (Castle Gate), Melrose (Abbey Street) and Selkirk (Mill Street). Changes to depots over the years comprised:

*1957: Hawick elevated to full depot status (code L)
*1960: new Baillieston (Station Road) depot opened (code C), partly to operate services taken over from Lowland Motorways
*1962: new engineering works and body shop opened at Marine Gardens (Seafield Road), Edinburgh
*1962: Victoria Depot, Airdrie (Gartlea Road) taken over with Baxter&#x27;s business (code V)
*1963: Melrose sub-depot closed
*1964: Dunbar (Countess Crescent) depot (code S) and North Berwick (Tantallon Road) sub-depot taken over with Stark&#x27;s business;
*1966: Dalkeith depot replaced by new combined depot/bus station at Eskbank Road (code G)
*1971: Selkirk sub-depot closed
*1979: Broxburn depot replaced by new combined depot/bus station at Livingston (Almondvale South) (code N)
*1979: Airdrie Victoria depot closed

===Deregulation===

In preparation for deregulation in 1986, and eventual privatisation, the Scottish Bus Group was reorganised in 1985. The Scottish Omnibuses operations from Berwick, Dunbar, Galashiels, Hawick, Jedburgh, Kelso, North Berwick and Peebles depots passed to a new company, Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., whilst Airdrie (Clarkston) depot was passed to Central Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., Linlithgow depot passed to Midland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., and Baillieston depot was closed (its vehicles and operations being transferred briefly to the Stepps depot of Midland Scottish, pending further reorganisation to create Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses Ltd.). The licences for express coach services passed to the new Scottish Citylink Coaches Ltd., and Marine Works passed to another new SBG subsidiary company, SBG Engineering Ltd. The remnant of Scottish Omnibuses, comprising the core of the former company&#x27;s territory in the Lothians area, with the depots at Bathgate, Dalkeith, Edinburgh, Livingston, Musselburgh and the sub-depot at Biggar (which closed in 1986), was renamed Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. Eastern Scottish retained the traditional green and cream livery for its fleet.

Upon deregulation, Eastern Scottish faced little to no competition outside Edinburgh, despite a highly urbanised operating area. Within Edinburgh, Eastern found itself sparring with the larger, dominant city operator, Lothian Regional Transport (LRT), for a larger share of the city traffic. In late 1986 Eastern introduced nine new routes within Edinburgh, some of which closely mirrored sections of existing LRT routes. These were numbered C1-C9, the minibuses carried the &quot;City Sprinter&quot; fleet branding. At the start of deregulation in October 1986, route C5 ran a 5 minute frequency between Clovenstone and Restalrig via the city centre, operating a hail and ride on some parts of the route. Some routes were operated by a fleet of 70 Dodge minibuses, whilst others used double deck buses, notably 25 secondhand ex-South Yorkshire Transport Volvo Ailsa B55s with Irish-built Van Hool-McArdle bodywork. Some of these routes only lasted for a short period.

LRT retaliated by extending services beyond the city boundary and deeper into Eastern&#x27;s operating area. Together with the loyalty of the passengers to the familiar &quot;madder&quot; coloured fleet of the &quot;corporation&quot; (as LRT was still sometimes known), LRT&#x27;s competitive tactics ensured that Eastern made no significant inroads to the city market. Despite competition between the two operators, bitter &quot;bus wars&quot; that broke out in other cities and towns across Scotland were largely avoided, and Eastern did not persevere with loss-making operations, but settled for economy by reducing use of St. Andrew&#x27;s Bus Station by running through Edinburgh city centre to destinations such as Charlotte Square, Haymarket, Clermiston and Silverknowes, and connecting traditional routes such as ones to Balerno and Wallyford end-to-end to create new cross-city links which in some cases competed with those of LRT.

===Privatisation===

Eastern Scottish was one of the most financially successful subsidiaries of the Scottish Bus Group, with an operating profit of £1.07m in 1989. This was due in large part to initiatives such as the City Sprinter minibus scheme, which had quickly expanded into a considerable network of high-frequency routes. In September 1990 the company was sold to its management and employees for £9.5m, making it the most expensive subsidiary in the sell-off. The company began trading as SMT once again, with a modern, stylised take on the traditional diamond logo. Some investment in new vehicles and the introduction of &quot;quality corridors&quot;, branded as &#x27;Diamond Service&#x27;, followed. Competitive attack on city routes using double-deckers was unsuccessful against the economy of scale available to LRT, lack of route coverage to make season ticket purchases attractive, and customer loyalty. 

In October 1994 the GRT Group, which later became FirstBus (April 1995) then FirstGroup in December 1997, bought the company for £10.3m. In 1996, the company, now trading as First SMT, was broken up and merged into neighbouring FirstGroup subsidiaries Midland Bluebird Ltd (formerly Midland Scottish) and Lowland Omnibuses (formerly Lowland Scottish) which later merged to form First Edinburgh, trading simply as First. Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd ceased trading as an independent concern.

<text>Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a former bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Bus Group, formed in June 1985 from Walter Alexander &amp; Sons (Fife) Ltd in preparation for bus deregulation and the subsequent privatisation of the Scottish Bus Group. The company today trades as part of Stagecoach East Scotland.

==History==

Fife Scottish&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1909, where after numerous buyouts and mergers, the company became part of W. Alexander &amp; Sons. In 1961, Walter Alexander &amp; Sons was split into three separate companies, with the Fife operations becoming &quot;Alexanders (Fife)&quot;, the colour red being used as the main fleet colour. Alexanders (Fife) was included with the purchase of W. Alexander &amp; Sons by Scottish Motor Traction, which following the passage of the Transport Act 1968, merged with other bus operators to form the Scottish Bus Group (SBG) on 1 January 1969.

Fife Scottish was first created by the SBG in 1978 as part of the rebranding of the Alexanders (Fife) operation. The company retained the red and cream livery as well as the Alexanders (Fife) legal address, however it adopted a group standard logo consisting of three-quarters of a blue saltire between the words &#x27;Fife&#x27; and &#x27;Scottish&#x27;. From its head office in Kirkcaldy, Fife Scottish operated throughout the ancient kingdom and beyond to Dundee and Edinburgh as the largest bus operator in the region, being responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in towns such as St Andrews, Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath, Glenrothes and Leven. Fife Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink services, which were operated mainly from Fife to other destinations across Scotland.

In preparation for the deregulation of the bus industry on 26 October 1986, which would ultimately see the breakup of the Scottish Bus Group, Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. was created amid the reorganisation of all SBG subsidiaries. Fife Scottish was the only SBG subsidiary to survive the reorganisation without losing any of its operating areas to the four new companies formed by the SBG, although it did not again any operating area from any pre-existing subsidiaries. The SBG corporate fleet name style was retained, albeit printed in an unusually large size and placed on buses painted with larger areas of cream.

Although Fife Scottish did not expand into the nearby cities of Edinburgh and Dundee following deregulation, the company still endured competition within its operating area. Rennie&#x27;s of Dunfermline were the first challengers to Fife Scottish, however the largest and most sustained competition came from local coach operator Moffat &amp; Williamson, who built up a substantial network of services throughout much of Fife that mirrored Fife Scottish&#x27;s network. A &quot;bus war&quot; broke out in Fife between Fife Scottish, Rennie&#x27;s and Moffatt &amp; Wilson, however Rennies soon withdrew from Dunfermline while Moffat &amp; Williamson scaled back its operations, though still retaining pockets of strong competition in the industrialised towns in the south of Fife.

===Stagecoach sale controversy===
Despite enduring heavy competition, Fife Scottish remained the most profitable of the SBG subsidiaries throughout the SBG&#x27;s gradual breakup. When the company was put on the market in February 1991 as the penultimate SBG subsidiary to be sold, Fife Scottish was seen by potential buyers as the &#x27;jewel in the crown&#x27; of the formerly state-owned bus group. Competitive bids were placed to buy the company, with Fife Scottish&#x27;s employees led by managing director Derek Stuart offering to perform either a management buyout or an employee share ownership plan as &#x27;Henjac 171&#x27;, while fast-growing Perth independent Stagecoach Holdings, who had already purchased former SBG subsidiary Bluebird Northern, also placed a bid to buy the company outright. Stagecoach was initially announced as the preferred bidder for Fife Scottish, however the sale was delayed after the Henjac team submitted a £9 million () bid rivalling Stagecoach&#x27;s, forcing Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland James Douglas-Hamilton to launch a review of the sale.

For six weeks between late May and July 1991, the Henjac employee team and Stagecoach Holdings competed with one another, placing revised bids. Following an initial judicial review, Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Lang announced that he would back Stagecoach&#x27;s bid for the company, causing outcry amid claims the Henjac bid was higher than Stagecoach&#x27;s. The Henjac team went to the Court of Session in Edinburgh in an attempt to make Ian Lang reconsider his views on Staegcoach&#x27;s bid, and although an appeal for an interim interdict was rejected, the sale to Stagecoach was blocked when the Scottish Transport Group agreed not to sell Fife Scottish to Stagecoach Holdings until the hearing into the sale was concluded. Despite three of four of Fife Scottish&#x27;s senior managers withdrawing from the Henjac team in July 1991 as a result of a disagreement over a proposed share structure, a bid to throw out Henjac&#x27;s case was rejected by the Court of Session. However, it was subsequently ruled by Lord Coulsfield that no grounds had been established by Henjac to justify a judicial review of Ian Lang&#x27;s decision, and ultimately, Fife Scottish was purchased by Stagecoach Holdings for £9.1 million (). 

Following the sale, Stagecoach engaged in increasingly severe competition with Moffat &amp; Williamson following the purchase of Fife Scottish, which was criticised for being predatory and uncompetitive, and a loss-making Moffat &amp; Williamson was forced to withdraw the majority of its competing services despite Stagecoach being reprimanded by the Office of Fair Trading. This resulted in Stagecoach Fife Scottish becoming the sole operator in much of the kingdom.

<text>Highland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was formed as a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group in June 1985 from Highland Omnibuses Ltd, and operated until October 1995 when the company was split into two - Highland Bus &amp; Coach and Highland Country Buses. The companies have since remerged and operate today as Highland Country Buses. It is now Stagecoach Highlands.

== Background ==

From its head office in Seafield Road, Inverness, Highland Scottish operated over the massive geographical, but sparsely populated, area of the Highland region of north west Scotland.

Highland Scottish was the largest operator in north west Scotland and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in and around the towns of Inverness, Aviemore, Nairn, Tain, Portree, Wick, Thurso and Fort William, with depots located in these towns. Services extended to Oban in the south, and Highland also operated coaches on long distance Scottish Citylink work, linking Inverness and the north west to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and points in England.

Highland Scottish only operated services on the mainland. Services in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland were operated by local independent operators.

On 16 May 2008, it was announced that the Stagecoach Group would purchase Rapson&#x27;s Coaches operations of Highland Country Buses and Orkney Coaches Ltd. The sale was completed in June 2008, adding over 200 buses to the Stagecoach fleet.

== History ==

Highland Scottish can be traced back to 1952 when Highland Omnibuses was created when Highland Transport, Macrae &amp; Dick and Alexanders Town Services in Inverness were joined together. In the reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group, in 1985, to prepare for deregulation and privatisation, the company was renamed Highland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. Unlike many of the original SBG subsidiaries, Highland&#x27;s operating area remained largely unchanged. No additional territory was gained, but Oban was transferred to Midland Scottish. The red and grey livery used by Highland Omnibuses was retained for the fleet.

Initially, upon deregulation, Highland continued to enjoy the monopoly position across much of its operating area. Competition started around Fort William with the arrival of a new company, Gaelic Bus, owned by Alexander MacConnacher, Brecklet, Ballachulish. However, it was the competition in the biggest town in the Highland Scottish network that was to prove controversial. 

Highland Scottish was the sole operator in Inverness and provided all bus services in and around the town. However, in May 1988, a group of ex-Highland drivers formed Inverness Traction Ltd, operating a fleet of leased minibuses and operating in parallel to Highland&#x27;s Inverness network. Highland&#x27;s response to the competition was fast and ferocious, cutting fare levels well below the competition and increasing traffic levels by 60%. Competition between the two operators was fierce and there was much ill will, with each operator accusing the other of unfair behaviour. Both companies suffered acute financial losses during the competition period, which ended when Inverness Traction went into receivership in April 1989.

The services operated by Inverness Traction, and the minibus leases, were immediately taken up by an Aberdeen-based coach operator, Alexanders (North East) Ltd. However, the intense competition continued and Alexanders also fell into receivership in November 1989. After a brief interval, the assets and services of Inverness Traction were purchased by the Stagecoach Group.

Highland, perhaps aware it could not sustain competition against a national operator with a reputation for swift and successful competition, scaled down the level of service against the new operator. Soon after, Stagecoach would purchase the Inverness and Tain operations of Highland Scottish and become the dominant operator of Inverness area services. 

In August 1991, Highland Scottish was sold to a consortium made up of Rapson&#x27;s Coaches, a coach operator based near Inverness, and Clansman Travel and Leisure, the holding company for Scottish Citylink, which had recently been purchased from the Scottish Bus Group through a management and employee buyout, for £800,000. In March 1993, ownership of Highland Scottish passed wholly to Rapson&#x27;s and a more modern deep red and cream livery, with a dark red wedge and yellow coachlines, was introduced for the fleet. The golden eagle emblem, once used by Highland Omnibuses, was reintroduced in a larger size toward the rear of the vehicle and the company traded simply as Highland. However, in October 1995, the company was split in two, with Rapson&#x27;s retaining the eastern services under Highland Bus &amp; Coach Ltd, with the remainder passed to a new company, Highland Country Buses Ltd. Highland Scottish Omnibuses at that time ceased to exist as a whole concern.

Highland Scottish remains as the trading name of Inverness bus station.

== Successor companies ==
Highland Country buses adopted a starkly different livery to the traditional red by going for a two-tone blue livery, with a large St Andrew&#x27;s Cross in the centre of its &#x27;Highland Country&#x27; logo. In January 1996 Highland Country Buses was bought by National Express for £1.8m. Highland Bus &amp; Coach, being the smaller of the two operators, continued to operate with the image its predecessor adopted. The two companies continued to exist under separate ownership until August 1998 when Rapson&#x27;s bought Highland Country Buses back from National Express for £4m - £2.2m more than Rapson&#x27;s originally sold the company for. Highland Country Buses is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Rapson&#x27;s Coaches, and covers the operating area that Highland Scottish had on privatisation. The company has adopted a &#x27;corporate look&#x27;, sharing the two-tone blue with silver trim livery that Rapson&#x27;s Coaches used, with the addition of the large golden eagle logo at the rear of the vehicle. While regular bus services trade as Highland Country, longer distance, express and private contract work operate under the Rapson&#x27;s name. In March 2005, Rapson&#x27;s completed its take over of the Orkney Islands bus market with the acquisition of four separate bus companies on the islands, including the largest, James D. Peace &amp; Shalder Coaches. The Orcadian operation trades as Orkney Coaches and remains a separate subsidiary to Highland.
All operations are now part of the Stagecoach Group.

<doc id="1129544" wikidata="Q6386732" url="?curid=1129544" title="Kelvin Scottish">
<text>Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group based in Bishopbriggs, Strathclyde, Scotland. It was formed in March 1985 from parts of Walter Alexander &amp; Sons (Midland) Ltd and Central SMT, initially with six depots and a varied fleet of 381 vehicles.

The company expanded its operations in Glasgow prior to bus deregulation in 1986. New services were introduced in competition with Strathclyde Buses, many using AEC Routemaster double-deckers operated by conductors. Kelvin suffered from vehicle maintenance problems, and on two occasions was forced to hire vehicles from other companies to ensure operation of all its routes. After Kelvin lost money in 1987, the depot at Milngavie was closed and many routes withdrawn.

In July 1989 Kelvin was merged with Central Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses. This company was sold to its employees on privatisation, before being taken over by Strathclyde Buses. It is now part of First Glasgow.

==Operation==
Operating from its head office in Bishopbriggs and depots in Old Kilpatrick, Milngavie, Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Stepps and Cumbernauld, Kelvin Scottish had an operating area bounded by Loch Lomond to the west, Cumbernauld to the east, the Campsie Fells to the north and the River Clyde to the south. Kelvin was the largest operator in Dunbartonshire and north east Glasgow, and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services. Its operating area had previously been served by W. Alexander &amp; Sons (Midland), Central SMT and Scottish Omnibuses (whose Baillieston depot had closed a few months earlier in 1985, with its vehicles and operations having transferred to Alexander (Midland) at Stepps).

==History==
Kelvin was created by the Scottish Bus Group (SBG) as a limited company wholly owned by the group in March 1985 in preparation for bus deregulation the following year, and began operation three months later. It was the largest of the four new companies created by the SBG in 1985, with an initial fleet of 381 vehicles, of which almost 300 were sourced from the former Alexander (Midland) fleet.

In early 1986, maintenance problems saw a number of vehicles banned from use by vehicle examiners from the Ministry of Transport. The company was forced to hire eight vehicles from other companies to keep services running; they remained in the fleet for four weeks while the regular vehicles were repaired. Similar issues resurfaced in February 1987, when twelve vehicles were hired for three weeks.

Deregulation presented both challenges and opportunities for Kelvin Scottish. During the regulated era, bus operators were protected from competition but could not change their routes without the approval of the licensing authority, and rival operators could object to applications. Historically, Glasgow Corporation had sought to prevent Scottish Bus Group services from penetrating into the middle of the city centre, partly to avoid congestion in the busiest streets but also as a means of bolstering their own tramway revenue. When Kelvin Scottish was formed, the former Alexander (Midland) and Scottish Omnibuses routes from north and east of the city terminated at Buchanan bus station on the northern edge of the city centre, whilst the former Central SMT routes from the west used Anderston bus station on the western extremity of the city centre. Passengers wishing to travel further into the city centre had to either walk or change to a Strathclyde Buses service. Deregulation allowed services to be extended further into the city centre, which would make services more convenient for passengers. On the other hand, a significant proportion of Kelvin&#x27;s route network served the city&#x27;s suburbs and peripheral estates and had been protected from competition from Strathclyde Buses due to the arbitrary company boundaries which regulation had created. As the city had expanded outward, Glasgow Corporation had not been allowed to extend its own services to serve these new estates as they were deemed to be SBG &#x27;territory&#x27;. These busy and profitable urban routes were an important part of Kelvin&#x27;s business, but with deregulation Strathclyde Buses would be able to extend their existing city services out to serve these areas, which would cause a serious loss of revenue for Kelvin. The inherited route network was therefore extensively reorganised in an effort to retain as many of the suburban passengers as possible whilst gaining new passengers within the city.

Although deregulation itself took place in October 1986, Kelvin received permission to introduce its new routes from 31 August. Many of the routes serving the suburbs and peripheral estates were linked together to create new cross-city routes instead of terminating in the city centre, with some of these being operated by former London Transport AEC Routemasters. The elderly Routemasters were faster than other buses because instead of passengers paying the driver on entry the fares were collected by a conductor whilst on the move, and the much shorter dwell time at bus stops gave Kelvin a competitive advantage over Strathclyde Buses&#x27; slower one-person-operated services. Some cross-city routes were operated jointly with Clydeside Scottish, and a number of new services were started on city routes which had not hitherto been served by the Scottish Bus Group. Another competitive tactic was the introduction of minibus services in the north of Glasgow, providing services into city centre at a much higher frequency than would have been viable using full-sized buses. In response Strathclyde Buses extended many of its city services not just into the peripheral parts of the city traditionally served by Kelvin, but also beyond the city boundary and deep into SBG territory, including the towns of Clydebank, Milngavie, Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld.

Immediately after deregulation the &#x27;bus war&#x27; between SBG and Strathclyde Buses, together with some independent operators such as Magic Bus, saw a major increase in the number of buses serving the city centre. However the situation was not sustainable as there were not enough passengers to make so many competing services viable, and ultimately Strathclyde Buses prevailed. In 1987 Kelvin made a reported loss of £3 million, leading to the closure of the depot at Milngavie. Many of the competing routes introduced in 1986 were withdrawn in July 1987, and 70 vehicles were taken out of service, including some Routemasters and the majority of the new minibuses. By early 1988 the fleet had been reduced by more than a third, and Kilsyth depot also closed in 1988 as an economy measure.

In July 1989, it was announced that SBG was to be privatised. In an effort to make Kelvin Scottish more attractive to prospective buyers, Kelvin was merged with the more profitable Central Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses Ltd. Upon the merger, Kelvin Scottish ceased trading as a stand-alone subsidiary. However, the merger involved harmonising conditions of service for employees, and whereas Kelvin had already had to impose new terms and conditions on its staff as a result of its financial problems, the changes were extremely unpopular with Central employees. Following the dismissal of four shop stewards a prolonged strike by 700 of the companies&#x27; drivers took place during 1989, which further weakened the finances of the Kelvin Central company and brought about further service cuts and the closure of the former Central depots at East Kilbride and Wishaw.

==Subsequent history==
Following the privatisation of Scottish Bus Group in 1991, Kelvin Central was sold to its employees. In 1994 it was taken over by Strathclyde Buses, which was itself bought out by FirstGroup two years later. Kelvin Central was renamed to First Glasgow (No.2) Ltd. in May 1998, with a red livery adopted. Its operations are now part of First Glasgow.

In 1995-96 the depots at Stepps, Kirkintilloch and Old Kilpatrick all closed as the operation of routes into the city were consolidated at the former Strathclyde Buses facilities and most of the outlying services were surrendered to independent operators. Cumbernauld depot was also closed by FirstGroup in 2013, but it was subsequently purchased by Stagecoach and reopened in 2016 to replace Stagecoach Glasgow&#x27;s Blochairn depot.

==Branding and promotions==
The company initially adopted a simple two-tone blue livery with a logo incorporating the Flag of Scotland and the words &quot;Scottish&quot; and &quot;Kelvin&quot;; a more striking livery consisting of two lighter shades of blue and yellow applied diagonally was introduced in September 1985. This was revised in early 1988 to yellow and light blue with a dark blue diagonal stripe. Following the merger in 1989 Kelvin Central Buses adopted the former Central Scottish &#x27;Lanarkshire Bus&#x27; red and cream livery.

As a result of increased competition in Dunbartonshire following deregulation, Kelvin decided to introduce additional fleetnames to its vehicles to establish local identities. From April 1987 onwards &quot;Dumbarton BUS&quot; appeared on vehicles operating in Dumbarton and Loch Lomondside. In October &quot;Kirkie BUS&quot; was introduced onto Kirkintilloch-based vehicles and &quot;Cumbernauld&#x27;s Buses&quot; onto vehicles stationed in that town.

In 1988 a new fares scheme, the Glasgow Gold Card, was introduced, offering weekly travel on all SBG routes in the city. A Kelvin AEC Routemaster bus was painted in a gold livery to advertise the ticket, and remained in the livery until withdrawal by Kelvin Central in 1991.

==Fleet==
The fleet acquired by Kelvin at its formation was very mixed, reflecting the different vehicle policies of its predecessor companies. Of the 381 vehicles in the initial fleet, 135 were double-deck, mostly Daimler and Leyland Fleetlines and MCW Metrobuses, together with twelve Dennis Dominators and eight Leyland Olympians. Of the single-deckers, the most numerous were 153 Leyland Leopards, while other types were the Leyland National, Leyland Tiger and Seddon Pennine 7. This mix of vehicles included various types which Kelvin&#x27;s management did not consider suitable for the firm&#x27;s predominantly urban operations, and vehicle swaps were arranged with several other Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries. In exchange for more Leyland Nationals with (relatively) wide doors and low floor heights, Kelvin disposed of some of its Leyland Leopard and Tiger service buses with higher floors and narrow doorways, along with coaches and dual-purpose vehicles that were more suited to longer-distance routes.

A fleet of secondhand AEC Routemaster buses were purchased from London Transport in 1986 to launch the new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff, and although some were disposed of following the 1987 service cuts forty of the type continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, which was one of the last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.

Although the original fleet did not include any minibuses, forty-three new Mercedes-Benz L608D vehicles were introduced from September 1986 for the high-frequency service in central and northern Glasgow; but this did not prove profitable and was converted to full-size operation a year later, with many of the minibuses transferred to other SBG subsidiaries. Full-sized buses purchased new in 1986-87 comprised a solitary Leyland Lynx (the only one of its type in the Scottish Bus Group), ten MCW Metrobus dual-purpose double deckers for Cumbernauld to Glasgow express services and four Leyland Tiger coaches for Scottish Citylink work. Six rare Leyland-DAB Lion dual-purpose double-deckers were also ordered for delivery in 1987, but owing to the large cut in Kelvin&#x27;s peak vehicle requirement their purchase was cancelled and they were instead bought by Clydeside Scottish.

<text>Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a bus operator in south eastern Scotland and parts of Northern England. The company was formed in 1985 and operated under the identities Lowland Scottish, Lowland and First Lowland / First SMT, until 1999 when the company&#x27;s operations were combined with the operations of Midland Bluebird in a new company, First Edinburgh Ltd.
As of 26 March 2017 these operations were transferred to West Coast Motors (trading as Borders Buses).

== Operation ==

From its head office in Galashiels, Lowland Scottish operated throughout the Scottish Borders and parts of Lothian in south east Scotland and across the border into Northumberland in north east England, bounded by Edinburgh to the north, Peebles to the west and Berwick-upon-Tweed in the east.

Lowland Scottish operated from depots in the towns of Galashiels, Haddington, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Dunbar, Hawick, Jedburgh, Kelso, North Berwick and Peebles. Principal services linked these towns with Edinburgh and with each other, along with a limited number of urban services in the larger towns and other rural or schools services. The most important route in the Borders was Service 95, linking Edinburgh and Carlisle, branded as the &quot;Borders Rail Link&quot; bus service.

== History ==

Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Limited was created in 1985 as part of the reorganisation of the state owned Scottish Bus Group (SBG) in preparation for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation. It inherited the south-eastern depots and operations of Scottish Omnibuses Limited (Eastern Scottish), in the Scottish Borders, eastern East Lothian and Berwick-upon-Tweed. The new company introduced a new livery similar to the green and cream Eastern Scottish colours, but using a brighter green and a more striking yellow.

Upon formation, Lowland initially faced no significant competition, thanks largely to its sparsely populated operating area. Town services within Berwick-upon-Tweed continued to be shared with recently privatised Northumbria Motor Services, with Lowland and Northumbria having adjacent depot buildings fronting a shared bus station. This working relationship had been built up between the companies&#x27; predecessors, Scottish Omnibuses (SMT/Eastern Scottish) and United Automobile Services.
On deregulation, the relationship between Lowland and Northumbria in Berwick-upon-Tweed broke down, and fierce competition ensued between the two operators for several years. The &#x27;bus war&#x27; eventually ended in the mid-1990s with Lowland pulling out of Berwick as part of an agreement between First and Cowie Group, by that time owners of Lowland and Northumbria respectively. Arriva, Cowie Group&#x27;s successor, withdrew from Berwick ten years later, leaving the town routes to a local independent operator, Perryman&#x27;s Buses.

Lowland Scottish became the first of the SBG subsidiaries to be privatised when in August 1990 the company&#x27;s management and employees bought the business for £3.1m through their holding company Reiver Ventures Ltd., the word &quot;Scottish&quot; then dropped from the company&#x27;s legal and trading names at that time. Lowland had been a profitable unit within the SBG thanks largely to the limited competition in its rural territory, though this operating area did not give much scope for expansion. The company therefore sought to develop its coach business and to expand its presence in the more populated Lothians area. In 1991 the bus and coach business of Ian Glass Coaches was acquired, with a depot in Haddington. The depot in Dunbar closed shortly afterwards, as the East Lothian area operations were concentrated on Haddington. Smaller takeovers were of Shanks (&#x27;Border Travel&#x27;) of Galashiels in 1992 and Grieve&#x27;s Taxis of Hawick in 1993. Diversification included the acquisition of a van hire firm, and development of the PSV/HGV driving school business inherited from Shanks. The company also acquired an interest in Lothian Transit of Newtongrange, a low-cost operator running tendered bus services in the Edinburgh area.

== Demise ==

In November 1994, GRT Group (which later became FirstGroup) bought Reiver Ventures for £2.4m. GRT had purchased neighbouring Eastern Scottish (now trading as SMT once more) the previous month, and with its ownership of Midland Bluebird (the old Midland Scottish), GRT operated across a substantial part of central Scotland, from Oban in the west coast to the border with England. Reorganisation of the three companies quickly followed, breaking SMT in two and merging the parts with Midland and Lowland. As a result, Lowland inherited SMT&#x27;s Dalkeith and Musselburgh depots in 1996. This changed the focus of the company from a rural operator serving the Borders to one dominated by suburban services around Edinburgh, and coincided with the start of a gradual retrenchment in the south which eventually resulted in the closure of all of the Borders depots except Galashiels.

When the &#x27;First&#x27; corporate style was introduced, the trading names First Lowland and First SMT were used, the latter being restricted to the former SMT operations around Edinburgh. A final round of reorganisation in 1999 saw Lowland Omnibuses absorbed into Midland Bluebird Ltd and a new company, First Edinburgh Ltd.

Subsequently FirstGroup has divested itself of all its operations in the Borders. Borders Buses now cover virtually all the major routes once run by Lowland, with the exception of those in East Lothian.

<text>Midland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was a bus operator formed in June 1985 as a subsidiary of the Scottish Bus Group, created from part of W. Alexander &amp; Sons (Midland) Ltd. The company operated as Midland Scottish until 1991, when it was renamed Midland Bluebird in preparation for privatisation.

From its head office in Camelon (later Larbert), Midland Scottish was the largest bus operator in Stirling, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk districts and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in and around Stirling, the Trossachs, Alloa, Falkirk, and Linlithgow, as well as parts of Argyllshire. Services from these places extended into Glasgow, Edinburgh and Perth. The company also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink express work, mainly north west and central Scotland to other towns and cities in Scotland and England.

==History==
Midland Scottish&#x27;s predecessor company, W Alexander &amp; Sons can be traced back to 1923, being split into three smaller companies in 1961. The largest of these, Midland, subsequently renamed Midland Scottish, had an operating territory extended from Glasgow and Bo&#x27;ness in the south to Oban and Pitlochry in the north. In 1970 the Oban depot and services had been transferred to Highland Omnibuses, but the operating area was still large and varied.

In preparation for deregulation of the bus industry and eventual privatisation, the Scottish Bus Group reorganised its subsidiaries in 1985 to create smaller operating units which more closely corresponded with local government boundaries and which reduced the number of jointly-operated services. The Alexander (Midland) depots at within Strathclyde were ceded to a new company named Kelvin Scottish, whilst those in Tayside passed to another new company named Strathtay Scottish. The company&#x27;s central works in Falkirk adjacent to Larbert depot also passed to another new SBG subsidiary, SBG Engineering.

The remainder of Alexander (Midland) was renamed Midland Scottish Omnibuses, and consisted of the Central Region depots at Alloa, Balfron, Bannockburn, Callander, Grangemouth and Larbert. Midland Scottish also were transferred the former Scottish Omnibuses depot at Linlithgow in West Lothian, giving Midland Scottish full responsibility for jointly operated Edinburgh to Stirling and Falkirk services, alongside the SBG&#x27;s Highland Scottish Argyllshire operations from Oban depot and Western SMT depots Ardrishaig and Bridgend, Islay. The traditional Alexander&#x27;s azure blue and ivory livery was retained for the Midland Scottish fleet, and some coaches and dual-purpose vehicles continued to wear the bluebird logo that had long been used by Alexander&#x27;s coaching operations. The Bluebird name was also revived as a marketing name for express services into Glasgow and Edinburgh and for the coach fleet.

Compared to some other SBG subsidiaries, Midland Scottish&#x27;s operations continued largely unchanged by deregulation. The company did not compete against city operators in Glasgow or Edinburgh which were on the outer extremities of its territory, and within the core Stirling and Falkirk area it faced only light competition from small independent firms. As a result, Midland was one of the most successful of the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, being the second most profitable after Fife Scottish.

The Argyllshire operations were detached from the rest of the company but had been given to Midland Scottish in 1985 as it was the closest subsidiary with a partially rural operating area. They were considered too small to become a separate company in their own right, too far from Inverness to be managed by Highland Scottish, and too dissimilar to Kelvin Scottish&#x27;s largely urban network around Glasgow. Nevertheless they were peripheral to Midland&#x27;s operations and the company soon began to divest itself of them. The Islay operations were surrendered to a local independent, whilst the Ardrishaig depot was sold to West Coast Motors of Campbeltown in 1987.

In 1988, SBG Engineering closed the Larbert works and Midland Scottish took it over as their head office. In 1990, as the company prepared for privatisation, it began trading as Midland Bluebird. It became the second SBG subsidiary to be privatised when it was sold for £8.5 million () in September 1990 to the GRT Group. Shortly afterward, the company changed its legal name to Midland Bluebird, with buses receiving a livery in the style of other GRT Group companies.

Midland Bluebird&#x27;s Oban depot was sold to Oban &amp; District in 1992, completing the withdrawal from Argyllshire, and in September 1992, the company announced a smoking ban on all its services from 12 October after a highly publicised public consultation found that 91% of respondents wished smoking to be banned on its services.

The former operations of Midland Scottish are today part of McGill&#x27;s Scotland East.

<text>Stagecoach Bluebird (also known by its legal operating name Bluebird Buses Ltd, and formerly Northern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd) is a Scottish bus company which operates bus services in the areas of Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray. It is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group.

The company held a royal warrant granted by Elizabeth II for bus and coach services in 1996, which expired with the death of Elizabeth II in 2022.

==Operation==
From its head office on Guild Street, Aberdeen, Stagecoach Bluebird covers an operating range stretching over Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray.

It is the largest operator in the north east of Scotland and is responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in the towns of Alford, Ballater, Braemar, Buckie, Elgin, Forres, Fraserburgh, Fyvie, Macduff, Mintlaw, Peterhead and Stonehaven as well as city services in Aberdeen. Depots are also located in these towns.

Bluebird also provide coaches for Scottish Citylink services, mainly from Aberdeen to Perth, Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

==History==

The company was formed as Northern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd in June 1985 from the northern operations of W. Alexander &amp; Sons (Northern) Ltd. (which had already traded as &quot;Northern Scottish&quot; since 1978 and was then a member of the Scottish Bus Group). The southern operations in Blairgowrie, Arbroath, Montrose, Forfar and Dundee were ceded to a new company, Strathtay Scottish. From its creation, the company retained the traditional yellow and cream livery from its SBG predecessor.

On the approach to deregulation of the British bus industry in 1986, Northern had a working relationship with Aberdeen city operator Grampian Regional Transport, and operated some services together under the Grampian Scottish name. However, the co-operation would be short lived, and upon deregulation Northern Scottish launched a network of services throughout Aberdeen under the CityBus brand and adopting dual-door double deckers, non-standard for Northern but common with Grampian. In response, Grampian would extend its operations outwith Aberdeen and into Northern&#x27;s rural operating base, and in 1990, planned an ultimately unsuccessful bid to buy out Northern.

Outside Aberdeen, Northern saw little to no competition, thanks in part to its largely rural and remote territory.

Toward privatisation, the company resurrected the bluebird logo that was once used by Walter Alexander for its coaching operations. Midland Scottish, itself a fellow SBG subsidiary and once also part of the Alexander&#x27;s company, had continued to use the same logo, and as it rebranded itself as Midland Bluebird, Northern Scottish began trading as Bluebird Northern. Some vehicles operated in the Elgin area were, however, branded as Moray Bluebird, whilst those operating in the Peterhead and Fraserburgh areas were branded Buchan Bluebird.

Though its operations remained largely the same since its formation in 1985 (and earlier) and with little competition, Northern Scottish was not one of the most profitable of the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, largely due to the sparse population in its large operating area. However, the company was successfully privatised, being bought by Perth-based transport group Stagecoach for £5.7m in March 1991 in their first acquisition of a former SBG company.

In 1996, Stagecoach Bluebird were granted a royal warrant from Elizabeth II for bus and coach services. Following the closure of the Deeside Railway, which provided royal trains from Balmoral Castle to Aberdeen, in 1966, Northern and its successors provided coach transport to the castle for the royal family&#x27;s summer holidays. The warrant expired with the death of Elizabeth II in 2022.

A Stagecoach Bluebird bus driver died in hospital following an assault by a teenage passenger in Elgin bus station on 2 February 2024.

The Stagecoach Group announced in June 2024 that it had opened a review of its Bluebird operations as a result of the cost of operating the business making it increasingly unsustainable to run. Options that have been considered by the group include the potential closure of Insch and Stonehaven depots, as well as transferring fleet engineering from Elgin depot to Stagecoach Highlands&#x27; Inverness headquarters.

In August 2024, following a review of Stagecoach Bluebird services, the Stagecoach Highlands and Stagecoach Bluebird operations (excluding Orkney) were merged under the Bluebird Buses license. As a result, the Stagecoach Highlands operation now only exists on Orkney Island.

==Fleet==
Together with Stagecoach Highlands, as of April 2019, the combined Stagecoach North Scotland operation operates 383 buses and coaches.

<text>Strathtay Scottish was a bus operator running services in Dundee, Angus and parts of Grampian in eastern Scotland. Formed in 1985 ahead of bus deregulation as a subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group from parts of Walter Alexander &amp; Sons (Midland) Ltd and Walter Alexander &amp; Sons (Northern) Ltd., Strathtay was purchased by the Traction Group in 1991 and operated as a subsidiary of the company until 2005, when parent company Yorkshire Traction was purchased by the Stagecoach Group. The company today trades as part of Stagecoach East Scotland.

==History==

Strathtay Scottish was one of four new companies created through the reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group (SBG) in preparation for the deregulation of the bus industry on 26 October 1986, which would ultimately see the break-up of the SBG. Strathtay inherited the eastern operations of W. Alexander &amp; Sons (Midland) based in Perth, Crieff and Pitlochry, as well as the southern operations of W. Alexander (Northern) in Dundee, Forfar, Arbroath, Blairgowrie and Montrose. A bright blue and orange livery was adopted for the fleet, which would be controlled from Dundee.

The company would have a turbulent infancy, facing very heavy competition from Perth-based operator Stagecoach, who engaged in a bus war with Strathtay Scottish between 1989 and 1991. After managing director Neil Renilson had resigned from Strathtay Scottish to join Stagecoach ahead of the company&#x27;s commencement of Perth services on 19 June 1989, Strathtay Scottish purchased a number of ex-London Transport AEC Routemaster buses to compete with Stagecoach, which also used a number of the same vehicle type on city services in Perth. A new &quot;Perth City Transport&quot; brand was created by Strathtay Scottish to compete with Stagecoach, with buses painted in a red and white livery. As Stagecoach grew nationally, it became financially stronger and had ready access to vehicles from the larger companies in England it had purchased; Strathtay Scottish, meanwhile, was ultimately unable to sustain the level of intense competition that ensued.

Despite experiencing heavy and sustained competition on its Perth services, Strathtay Scottish managed to remain profitable prior to its privatisation from the Scottish Bus Group. Strathtay workers attempted to carry out a management buyout of the company from the SBG, however they would be outbid by Barnsley-based Yorkshire Traction, which Strathtay Scottish was sold to in May 1991 for £1.9 million (). As a subsidiary of the Traction Group, the company was renamed to Strathtay Buses, with the new owners establishing and maintaining a working relationship with Stagecoach around Perth, jointly operating the trunk service between Dundee and Perth with the national operator. The remainder of the operations remained largely unchanged from privatisation, however Crieff and Pitlochry depots would close during 1991 as a result of Stagecoach&#x27;s prior competition, resulting in Strathtay withdrawing from the majority of services around both towns, followed by Strathtay closing its Perth depot in 1993, resulting in bus services in the city being entirely operated by Stagecoach. 

On 14 December 2005, the Traction Group was purchased by Stagecoach for £26 million (), resulting in Strathtay becoming a subsidiary of Stagecoach East Scotland. Buses were initially branded with modified Strathtay fleetnames on top of standard fleet livery, however the fleet would later rebrand to &#x27;Stagecoach in Strathtay&#x27; using conventional Stagecoach fleetnames.

<text>Western Scottish Omnibuses Ltd, in Scotland, was a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group formed in June 1985 from Western SMT Company Ltd and operated until 1997, when it became Western Buses Ltd. This successor company is now a part of Stagecoach West Scotland.

== Operation ==
From its head office in Nursery Avenue, Kilmarnock, Western Scottish covered an operating area bounded by Ardrossan in the north, Glasgow to the east, the Firth of Clyde to the west and Carlisle to the south.

Western was the largest operator in south west Scotland and was responsible for local bus services in the towns of Kilmarnock, Ayr, Cumnock, Girvan, Stranraer and Dumfries as well as rural services, interurban connections and cross-border journeys into north west England. Depots were located in those towns, as well as Annan, Ardrossan, Carlisle (shared with Cumberland Motor Services) and Whithorn. Vehicles were also &#x27;outstationed&#x27; at Kirkcudbright, Lockerbie, Penpont and Sanquhar. The company would eventually establish bases in Brodick, Isle of Arran and Dunoon, Argyll also.

Western Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink work, mainly from the south west of Scotland to Glasgow, Edinburgh, London and the south.

Though the northern portion of the former Western SMT&#x27;s operating area, covering Inverclyde, Renfrewshire and the Isle of Bute, was ceded to a new company, Clydeside Scottish, in June 1985 (in order to prepare the Scottish Bus Group for deregulation in 1986 and eventual privatisation), Clydeside Scottish was remerged with Western in May 1989. Depots at Largs, Greenock, Paisley, Johnstone, Inchinnan, Rothesay and Thornliebank on the south side of Glasgow were added on the merger of the two companies.

== History ==
Though its predecessor company Western SMT had a much longer and more distinguished history, Western Scottish was a relatively short lived legal creation. The traditional, smart red and cream livery the vehicles wore gave way to a black, white and two-tone grey scheme shortly after the company was created. This livery was short lived, however, and a black, white and red scheme took over within a couple of years. Due to the length of time taken to repaint the fleet, for a number of years vehicles appeared in three distinct liveries.

Western suffered from heavy competition after deregulation, particularly around Kilmarnock and Ayr, which, as the heavier populated areas of its operating area, provided the firm with the bulk of its income. Keenan of Ayr, Carrick Coaches, Shuttle Buses and various smaller operators appeared, challenging and weakening the dominant operator.

In May 1989, Clydeside Scottish was remerged with Western, still under the legal name of Western Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. The aim of the merger was to strengthen the two weakened giants and thus make the company a more attractive proposition for potential buyers on the run up to privatisation. Clydeside Scottish had existed for less than five years, and Western&#x27;s operating region now covered the same geographical area the former Western SMT did. Though the former Clydeside Scottish operation continued to trade simply as &#x27;Clydeside&#x27;, the vehicles were given the Western black, white and red livery.

During this time, however, extremely heavy and sustained competition from a multitude of smaller operators in Greenock and Paisley continued to financially weaken the company.

Western Scottish was purchased by its management and employee in October 1991 for £1m, with an immediate onward sale of the Clydeside operations and their depots to their management and employees as Clydeside 2000 plc (with Luton &amp; District taking a 24% stake). The depot at Largs was closed, and Rothesay depot remained with Western Scottish. The Ardrossan depot closed shortly afterward.

The newly privatised Western Scottish was successful in securing all the tendered services on the Isle of Arran, putting the future of the small Brodick-based operator Arran Transport in jeopardy and drawing howls of protest and criticism from locals and the local media. However, Arran Transport managed to stay in business by competing against the larger operator on its home island, and also the neighbouring Isle of Bute. In its home town of Kilmarnock, Western faced increasing levels of competition, most notably from Clyde Coast Coaches Ltd of Ardrossan, and retaliated by offering a free service between Saltcoats and Largs, Clyde Coast&#x27;s traditional route. In 1993, a small operation was established in Dunoon, when Western won one tendered local service. Two Dennis Dart vehicles were stationed there until two years later when further routes were won and a depot running around 15 buses was opened there.

Stagecoach Group took over in July 1994 for £6m, and the &#x27;bus war&#x27; with Clyde Coast was soon ended. Trading as Stagecoach Western Scottish, the company adopted the corporate Stagecoach white with red, blue and orange stripes and began expanding. Arran Transport was purchased in October 1994, followed by the much larger A1 Service operation in January 1995 - adding some 80 vehicles and operations in North Ayrshire from a new depot in Ardrossan. Stagecoach responded fiercely to the competition in Western&#x27;s operating area, and was banned by the Traffic Commissioner from operating on the Ayr to Dalmellington route due to predatory and uncompetitive action against competitor Carrick Coaches for a period of one year. For the period of this ban AA Buses, which would later be owned by Stagecoach, registered a new service for the one-year period, matching the service that Stagecoach Western was forced to withdraw.

Stagecoach was also forced to withdraw from a co-operative service run from Ayr to Greenock with Clyde Coast, Clydeside and AA Buses. A new operator, Ashton Coaches, had successfully pioneered the 585 Coastliner service from Ayr to Greenock. As this partially competed (though not directly) with services provided by Clyde Coast, Clydeside, AA Buses and Stagecoach Western Scottish, these operators provided two vehicles each, branded 535 Coastlink and using a similar green and white livery, and operated to the same timetable as the competition.

1995 also saw the purchase of the bus operations of Clyde Coast, and in June 1997 the bus operations of Dodds of Troon and AA Buses of Ayr were purchased, together with the bus operations of Shuttle Buses, adding services around Kilwinning, Irvine and Troon to the Western operation. At that time, the head office was moved to Sandgate Bus Station in Ayr, and the company name changed to Western Buses Ltd in the process.

<doc id="1129554" wikidata="Q1400616" url="?curid=1129554" title="Eighth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Eighth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (Dynasty VIII) is a poorly known and short-lived line of pharaohs reigning in rapid succession in the early 22nd century BC, likely with their seat of power in Memphis. The Eighth Dynasty held sway at a time referred to as the very end of the Old Kingdom or the beginning of the First Intermediate Period. The power of the pharaohs was waning while that of the provincial governors, known as nomarchs, was increasingly important, the Egyptian state having by then effectively turned into a feudal system. In spite of close relations between the Memphite kings and powerful nomarchs, notably in Coptos, the Eighth Dynasty was eventually overthrown by the nomarchs of Heracleopolis Magna, who founded the Ninth Dynasty. The Eighth Dynasty is sometimes combined with the preceding Seventh Dynasty, owing to the lack of archeological evidence for the latter which may be fictitious.

Egyptologists estimate that the Eighth Dynasty ruled Egypt for approximately 20–45 years and various dates have been proposed: 2190–2165 BC, 2181–2160 BC, 2191–2145 BC, 2150–2118 BC.

==Sources==

===Historical===
====New Kingdom sources====
Two historical sources dating to the New Kingdom list kings belonging to the Eighth Dynasty. The earliest of the two and main historical source on the Eighth Dynasty is the Abydos king list, written during the reign of Seti I. The kings listed on the entries 40 to 56 of the Abydos king list are placed between the end of the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom period and the beginning of the Eleventh Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. Furthermore, the names of these kings are different from those known from the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties, none of which are on the Abydos list. As a consequence, entries 40 to 56 of the list are assigned to the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties.

The other New Kingdom source on the Eighth Dynasty is the Turin canon, written during the reign of Ramses II. The Turin papyrus was copied from an earlier source which, as the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt has shown, was itself riddled with lacunae and must have been in a poor state. In addition, the Turin papyrus is itself heavily damaged and cannot be read without much difficulty. In total three names are present on papyrus fragments which might be allocated to Eighth Dynasty kings. These are Netjerkare Siptah, another hard to read name and finally, that of Qakare Ibi, the fifty-third king on the Abydos king list. There seems to be room for two or three more kings before the end of the dynasty as recorded on the list. This would indicate that the missing parts of the Turin canon probably contained the kings in the fifty-first to fifty-fifth registers of the Abydos King List. Because the Turin papyrus omits the first nine kings on the Abydos list, W.C. Hayes thinks it reasonable that the Egyptians may have divided Dynasties VII and VIII at this point.

====Ptolemaic source====
The Egyptian priest Manetho wrote a history of Egypt during the 3rd century BC known as the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;. Manetho&#x27;s work has not survived to this day and is only known to us via three later writers who quoted from it. Unfortunately, these three sources are exceedingly difficult to work with. For example, they often contradict each other, as is the case for the two ancient historians – Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea – who quote from the section of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; regarding the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties. Africanus claims that the 7th Dynasty consisted of 70 kings that ruled during a period of seventy days in Memphis, and the 8th Dynasty consisted of 27 kings who reigned for 146 years. However, Eusebius records that during the 7th Dynasty five kings ruled over seventy five days, and the 8th Dynasty includes five kings who ruled for 100 years. Seventy kings in seventy days is usually considered the correct version of Manetho concerning the Seventh Dynasty, but likely not a factual account of history. Rather, this is interpreted to mean that the pharaohs of this period were extremely ephemeral, and the use of seventy may be a pun on the fact that this was Manetho&#x27;s Seventh Dynasty. Because Manetho does not provide actual historical data on this period and no archeological evidence for the Seventh Dynasty has emerged, many Egyptologists have argued that this dynasty is fictitious. Concerning the Eighth Dynasty, it is now widely agreed that Manetho&#x27;s estimate for its duration is a very substantial overestimation of the reality.

===Contemporary evidence===
The main archaeological evidence for kings of the Eighth Dynasty are royal decrees discovered in Coptos, which name some of the last pharaohs of the dynasty. Further tentative evidence for the early kings of the dynasty comes from tombs in Saqqara, in particular the pyramid of Qakare Ibi in Saqqara. Beyond that, there are royal inscriptions found in the Wadi Hammamat and in Upper Egypt, as well as non-royal ones from Upper Egypt as well.

==End of the Old Kingdom and decline into chaos==

The Eighth Dynasty has traditionally been classified as the first dynasty of the First Intermediate Period owing to the ephemeral nature of its kings&#x27; reigns as well as the sparsity of contemporary evidence, hinting at a decline of the state into chaos. Recent re-appraisal of the archaeological evidence has shown a strong continuity between the Sixth and Eighth Dynasties, so that Egyptologist Hratch Papazian has proposed that the Eighth Dynasty rather than the Sixth should be seen as the last of the Old Kingdom period.

Given that five Eighth Dynasty kings bore Pepi II&#x27;s throne name &quot;Neferkare&quot; as part of their own names, they may have been descendants of 6th Dynasty, who were trying to hold on to some sort of power. Some of the acts of the final four Dynasty VIII kings are recorded in their decrees to Shemay, a vizier during this period, although only Qakare Ibi can be connected to any monumental construction. His pyramid has been found at Saqqara near that of Pepi II and, like its predecessors, had the Pyramid Texts written on the walls.

However many kings there actually were, it is clear that during this time period a breakdown of the central authority of Egypt was underway. The rulers of these dynasties were based in Memphis and seem to have relied on the power of the nomarchs of Coptos, on whom they bestowed titles and honours. This must have been to no avail as the Eighth Dynasty was eventually overthrown by a rival group based in Herakleopolis Magna.

==Rulers==
Given the lack of evidence for the Seventh Dynasty, all kings mentioned on the Abydos king list in the entries after that of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II and before that of Montuhotep II are usually attributed to the Eighth Dynasty. Following Jürgen von Beckerath, they are :
The Egyptologist Hratch Papazian believes that such a reconstruction gives too much weight to Manetho&#x27;s account, according to which the Seventh Dynasty is essentially fictitious and a metaphor of chaos. Instead Papazian proposes that the earliest of the above kings are immediate successors of Pepi II and should be attributed to the Sixth Dynasty, while those just after them belong to a short-lived Seventh Dynasty. Then the Eighth Dynasty would only start with the well-attested Qakare-Ibi:
In addition, the identity and chronological position and extent of rule of the following rulers is highly uncertain: Wadjkare, Khuiqer, Khui and Iytjenu.

<text>Whitney Jordan Hill (born April 17, 1978) is an American singer-songwriter. She was signed to record producer David Foster&#x27;s label 143 Records, an imprint of Atlantic Records in 1995. Her first song, &quot;Remember Me This Way&quot;—produced by Foster—was the theme song for the 1995 film &quot;Casper&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Jordan Hill and her family later relocated to Los Angeles, where she completed her studies at the Hamilton Academy of Music and supported herself by playing at clubs and small venues.

She met David Foster in 1994 after performing at the producer’s California home. The pair understood each other almost immediately, and Foster wrote Hill&#x27;s debut single “Remember Me This Way”&quot;.&quot; It saw the light in 1995 via Foster’s 143 Records and was featured on the soundtrack for the feature film &quot;Casper&quot;.

Jordan Hill&#x27;s self-titled debut album was then released on May 21, 1996, and was produced by David Foster, Greg Charley, Rhett Lawrence, Jeff Pescetto, SoulShock &amp; Karlin and Mario Winans. Hill covered many songs, such as Cheryl Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Got to Be Real&quot;, Oleta Adams&#x27; &quot;I Just Had to Hear Your Voice&quot;, and Lisa Stansfield&#x27;s &quot;Make It Right&quot;.

The lead single of the album, &quot;For the Love of You&quot;, produced by Foster and Winans, became a hit both on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and R&amp;B/Hip-Hop charts. However, the remix version by Tony Moran became her biggest hit, entering the Top 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts.

The second single, released only in the UK was &quot;How Many Times&quot; (which was later covered by Aretha Franklin) and the third single, also a UK exclusive, was &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot;, a cover of the Bee Gees song and featured Barry Gibb singing backup. Due to a lack of support and promotion, she left the label.

Hill has worked with some notable artists, such as the Bee Gees and Jim Brickman, whose 1999 Top 10 adult contemporary hit &quot;Destiny&quot; featured Hill on vocals, along with Billy Porter. She resumed her solo career in 2012 with the festive single &quot;“Someday at Christmas,”&quot; reaching Number 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

As of 2014, Hill was writing and recording her second album, which was initially scheduled for release in 2015, but has yet to be released.

As resident commissioner, Fortuño represented Puerto Rico in the United States House of Representatives from 2005 to 2009; during his tenure, he served as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, as a Member of the newly created United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs and as co-chair of the Friends of Spain Caucus.

Fortuño won the 2008 PNP gubernatorial nomination by a wide margin after defeating former governor and then-senator Pedro Rosselló in the primaries. He then won the general election by a comfortable margin, defeating incumbent governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. Fortuño has served as president of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (PNP), the Council of State Governments, and the Southern Governors Association. Fortuño sought to be re-elected as governor in the 2012 elections, but was defeated by Alejandro García Padilla by 0.6%.

==Early life and family==
Fortuño was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of Luis Fortuño Moscoso, a dentist, and Shirley Burset. He is the eldest of four brothers. Fortuño is of paternal Spanish descent including Catalan and Galician, his great-great grandfather Jaime José Fortuño y Ferrús was from Tarragona. Fortuño also has Corsican lineage from his maternal great-grandfather.

==Education==
Fortuño attended Colegio Marista (Marist School) in Guaynabo, graduating in 1978. He then earned a Bachelor of Science degree in diplomacy from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. In 1985, he received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. During this period, Fortuño was an intern at the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in Washington, D.C.

While in college, Luis Fortuño co-founded the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association (PRSSA) with Kenneth McClintock and presided over the organization from 1980 to 1981. During the 1980 gubernatorial election recount, PRSSA generated more than 1,500 absentee ballots at Fortuño&#x27;s direction for incumbent Governor Carlos Romero Barceló. The generated ballots were an important factor in Romero Barceló&#x27;s reelection; he won by a slim margin of approximately 3000 votes. Fortuño was also active in other pro-statehood youth organizations and in the Republican Party. He is married to attorney Lucé Vela-Gutierrez; they have triplets, María Luisa, Luis Roberto, and Guillermo (born 1991) who were college students at mainland U.S. universities.

==Early career==
Fortuño entered public service in 1993 at the start of Governor Pedro Rosselló&#x27;s administration. He was first appointed executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company and president of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Hotel Development Corporation (HDC). In 1994, he became Puerto Rico&#x27;s first secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and Commerce. Fortuño was tasked with the development and implementation of large-scale changes of Puerto Rico&#x27;s tax, labor, corporate and commercial codes.

Fortuño was named 1996 Man of the Year by Caribbean Business, 1995 Public Servant of the Year by the Marketing Industry and Distribution of Food and Beverage Products Association of Puerto Rico, 1994 Public Servant of the Year by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, and 1994 Distinguished Executive by the Sales and Marketing Executives Association of Ponce and the Southern Region of Puerto Rico. He served on numerous boards of directors, including the Ana G. Méndez University System and the Puerto Rico Museum of Art. He is a member of the American Law Institute and the Urban Land Institute. In 1996, he served on the Platform Committee at the Republican National Convention, where he was successful in including the support for self-determination and eventual statehood for Puerto Rico in the party platform. Fortuño resigned his cabinet posts after Rosselló&#x27;s reelection in 1996 and returned to private law practice. 

Fortuño was a partner at the San Juan law firm of Correa, Collazo, Herrero, Jiménez &amp; Fortuño, specializing in corporate finance and real estate law. Prior to joining Correa, Collazo, Herrero, Jiménez &amp; Fortuño, he was a partner at McConnell Valdés LLC.

==Resident commissioner of Puerto Rico: 2005-2009==
===2004 campaign===
Fortuño decided to seek the New Progressive Party&#x27;s nomination for the post of resident commissioner of Puerto Rico late in the primary season. He won the November 2003 primaries with 61.28% of votes and defeated former senator Miriam Ramirez de Ferrer (4.26% of votes), former Senate President Charlie Rodriguez (6.29% of votes), and former governor and resident commissioner Carlos Romero Barceló (25.78% of votes). After winning the primary, he picked up momentum within the Republican Party ranks in the U.S. when he received the endorsement of Ed Gillespie, head of the Republican National Committee. Fortuño was the running mate of former governor Rosselló, who returned for a third bid as the PNP&#x27;s candidate for governor.

In the elections of 2004, Fortuño was victorious (48.5% of votes) over his main rival candidate Roberto Prats (48% of votes) of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP). Fortuño&#x27;s running mate, Pedro Rosselló, lost his bid for the governor&#x27;s seat to then resident commissioner Aníbal Acevedo Vilá by less than 4,000 votes. This meant that Fortuño would be the resident commissioner under Governor Acevedo Vilá of the PDP. This was the first time in Puerto Rican history that the governor of Puerto Rico and the resident commissioner were not from the same political party. Fortuño became the first resident commissioner to caucus with the GOP since Puerto Rico gained commonwealth status; the three previous PNP resident commissioners had originally aligned themselves with the Democrats.

===Tenure===
Upon the commencement of the 109th Congress, Fortuño was elected by his colleagues to serve as vice-president of the House Republican freshman class. He served as vice-chair of the Congressional Hispanic Conference during the 109th Congress and as chair during the 110th Congress. Fortuño was co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Spain, part of the Hispanic Conference Caucus. House Resources Committee Ranking Member Don Young appointed him in January 2007 as the Republican minority&#x27;s ranking member in the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs for the 110th Congress. Fortuño cosponsored the Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007, which would give Puerto Ricans the option to become a US state or sovereign state. In October, 2007, Fortuño filed legislation, along with Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) to assure the continued operation of the Arecibo Radiotelescope.

Fortuño was re-elected by the Republican Party of Puerto Rico&#x27;s General Assembly to continue serving as National Committeeman, a position he has held since 2001. He won reelection as National Committeeman in the GOP convention held on 20 May 2007 in Yauco, Puerto Rico.

In 2007, Fortuño joined Representative José Serrano (D-NY) and 128 other co-sponsors in filing HR 900, the Puerto Rico Democracy Act, to establish a self-determination process leading to political status change for Puerto Rico. The bill was amended and approved in a voice vote by the House&#x27;s Committee on Resources on 23 October, a major victory for Fortuño. However, as other political status bills in the past, the measure never made it to the President for his signature.

==Governor of Puerto Rico: 2009-2013==
===2008 election===

A poll taken before Fortuño Burset announced his gubernatorial bid in February 2007 suggests he is the most well-liked public figure in the PNP. The poll, taken by Gaither International at the request of &quot;Caribbean Business&quot; newspaper, indicated that Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, Fortuño&#x27;s likely opponent, would fare badly in the general election. Another poll released in May 2007 and taken by Kaagan Research Associates, Inc. at the request of &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;, a major circulation newspaper, showed Fortuño with a 46% to 25% advantage over incumbent Governor Acevedo Vilá. On 16 May 2007 poll also showed Fortuño winning a primary election against Pedro Rosselló 49% to 37%.

On 19 February 2007, Fortuño announced his candidacy for Governor of Puerto Rico for the 2008 general election. He faced former 2004 running mate and former governor Pedro Juan Rosselló González in an PNP primary on 9 March 2008 which he won by a 60% to 40% margin.

On 18 May 2007 Fortuño announced that former attorney general Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia would be his running mate and run for Fortuño&#x27;s current office of resident commissioner of Puerto Rico. Pierluisi Urrutia was a classmate at Colegio Marista, a fellow member of the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association and also a fellow cabinet member of Fortuño&#x27;s during former governor Rosselló&#x27;s first term from 1993 to 1996. 

On 9 March 2008, Fortuño easily defeated Rosselló at the PNP primaries and became the new president of the PNP and its official candidate for governor. Fortuño won the candidacy by obtaining nearly 60% of primary votes. Fortuño&#x27;s running mate and now official candidate for resident commissioner, Pedro Pierluisi, also won his primary.

On 4 November 2008, Fortuño became the ninth governor-elect of Puerto Rico by popular election winning by over 220,000 votes, the largest victory margin in 44 years and giving the New Progressive Party its largest victory in history. Also he became the second governor to get more than a million votes, after Pedro Rosselló&#x27;s reelection in 1996. Accompanied with his victory, the party gained control of the legislature by historic margins and the majority of mayoralties, and with it the power to name 3 Supreme Court judges that for the first time in history would give PNP appointees a majority on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. With this win, Fortuño would have the opportunity to name various fixed-term posts, including the comptroller, the ombudsman and the director of the Government Ethics Office.
Immediately after the 4 November 2008 general election, Governor-Elect Fortuño began the formation of an emerging administration. On 7 November, Fortuño held a caucus of incoming PNP legislators, who chose Thomas Rivera Schatz as the incoming Senate president in an uncontested election and Representative Jenniffer González as the new House speaker, succeeding the incumbent House speaker, who also competed. On 9 November, he announced the appointment of outgoing Senate president Kenneth McClintock as the head of the Incoming Committee on Government Transition. On 11 November, he began announcing the members of his Cabinet and other administration officials, beginning with McClintock&#x27;s appointment as secretary of state, equivalent to a lieutenant governor.

===Inauguration===
Fortuño&#x27;s oath of office was administered in the late afternoon of 2 January 2009, at a ceremony attended by five of the U.S. territory&#x27;s six living governors, Fortuño, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, Sila María Calderón, Carlos Romero Barceló and Rafael Hernández Colón. Only former governor Rosselló, who did not publicly endorse him, was absent.

Following tradition, the inaugural event was initially led by the outgoing secretary of state Fernando Bonilla and then by incoming secretary of state Kenneth McClintock. Among the thousands of attendees of the event were singer Marc Anthony and his then wife, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Janet Creighton and the head of Intergovernmental Affairs for President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s transition team, Nick Rathod. Foreign dignitaries included Dominican Republic president Leonel Fernández and the president of Dominica, Nicholas Liverpool. Following his inaugural address, Fortuño walked from the Capitol to La Fortaleza. In the evening, a free concert in Old San Juan and a state dinner hosted by the new Secretary of State were held.

===Administration, Cabinet, and Supreme Court appointments===
Of these, Secretary of State McClintock, Fortuño&#x27;s first Attorney General, Sagardía, Police Superintendent José Figueroa Sancha and Corrections Secretary Molina were the first to have been confirmed and formally sworn in.

At the end of his four-year term, Fortuño had retained 5 of the 14 members of his original constitutional cabinet, the secretaries of state, transportation, economic development and commerce, natural resources, and sports and recreation.

===Notable events===
====Healthcare====
Mitt Romney stated that he would repeal what he refers to as &quot;Obamacare,&quot; on &quot;my first day if elected president of the United States.&quot; Luis Fortuño&#x27;s position on President Obama&#x27;s initiative was to side with his Republican counterparts. On 24 February 2010, he stated in an interview with the local press that Obama&#x27;s proposal would have unfortunate results for Puerto Rico.&quot;

A year later, Fortuño joined with other Republican governors, signing a letter that asked for the &quot;full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.&quot;

====Economic crisis====
In a televised speech on 3 March 2009, 60 days after having been sworn in, Governor Fortuño announced his fiscal and economic recovery plan which included reducing the government&#x27;s annual expenditures by more than $2 billion at the start of the next fiscal year in July 2009. Media speculation estimated that a reduction of such magnitude could require permanently laying off up to 30,000 government workers. On 1 May 2009, a mass of workers marched through the streets of San Juan in response to the governor&#x27;s plan, protesting the government&#x27;s preparation for impending layoffs. Most of the frustration of the Puerto Rican constituents was due to the then candidate Luis Fortuno swearing that he would not lay off a single employee yet in his 3 March speech he warned that the $3.2 billion deficit he encountered might require laying off over 20,000-30,000 government employees.

On 15 October 2009, thousands of Puerto Rican workers and supporters gathered for what organizers tried to pass as a &quot;general strike&quot; over government budget cuts. Puerto Rico&#x27;s unemployment rate exceeded 16.7 percent in June, 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Fortuño administration expected the layoffs to propel that rate to 17.1 percent (the unemployment rate for April 2010 was 17.2).

On 26 August 2010, teachers unions staged one day walkout to protest what they say was Fortuño&#x27; plans to privatize employee pensions, a shortage of teachers and the deterioration of the school system. The walkout was the largest labor protest in public schools on the island since a 10-day strike in 2008 as teachers demanded improved wages and working conditions. The University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s administration under Fortuño attempted to enforce a $800 quota on students which led to the 2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes.

As a result of all the cost-cutting measures taken during his first two years in office, and the approval of Law 154 which imposes a temporary excise tax on overseas sales by major corporation over 6 years in a declining scale beginning at 6% which may be taken by affected corporation as a credit on their federal tax returns, on 31 January 2011, Fortuño signed Law 1 of 2011, the new Internal Revenue Code that provides, retroactive to 1 January 2010, tax relief including a 50% tax cut for individuals and 30% for businesses, beginning with a 7–14% tax cut for individuals and a 7% tax cut for businesses effective during tax year 2010.

Due to cost-containment and revenue generation measures, fiscal year 2009-10 ended with a $2 billion structural deficit, followed by a $1 billion structural deficit in 2010–11, $610 million in fiscal year 2011–12, $332.7 million in 2012–13, with a goal of achieving a structurally balanced budget by 1 July 2013.

==== Residente comments====
On 15 October 2009, Calle 13 won the Premios MTV Latinoamérica for &quot;Best Urban Artist&quot;. Pérez hosted the ceremony, and used this exposure to insult Puerto Rican governor Luis Fortuño and comment about a civilian general strike that was organized earlier that day, held to protest the firing of more than 25,000 public employees by Fortuño&#x27;s administration. Pérez generated much controversy after referring to Fortuño as an &quot;hijo de la gran puta&quot; The phrase is commonly translated as &quot;son of a bitch&quot;; in Spanish it is an insult to the person itself, equating to &quot;bad person&quot;.

====Rumored potential candidacy for national office====
Governor Fortuño was mentioned more than once as a long-shot potential candidate for nomination for president or vice president in 2012 and his frequent campaign trips to the mainland during the 2010 congressional races have been linked to potential national aspirations.

George Will endorsed Fortuño&#x27;s support for statehood as a national Republican strategy.

On 26 June 2011, he announced in Bayamón that he would seek a second term as Governor of Puerto Rico. In interviews he said that he would not aspire to a national office in 2012. More recently, Republican consultant Roger Stone mentioned Fortuño as a potential vice presidential nominee to win Hispanic American votes in 2012. In 2012, his name has continued resonating for national office.

Fortuño was included in an occasional vice presidential &quot;short list&quot;. In August 2012, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Fortuño &quot;is liked and trusted in the Romney campaign&quot; and &quot;Commerce or Interior are possibilities&quot; for Fortuño in a potential Romney cabinet.

====Obama names Fortuño to Council of Governors====
President Barack Obama nominated Governor Fortuño to the Council of Governors, a bipartisan commission aimed at improving coordination of efforts between state and federal agencies to address matters of defense and national security.

====Elected to leadership of the Council of State Governments====
On 22 May 2010, Governor Fortuño was elected vice president of the Council of State Governments (CSG), the first Puerto Rican to hold a leadership position in that intergovernmental organization since his now–secretary of state, Kenneth McClintock, served as chairman in 1999. CSG represents the three branches of government of the 55 states and territories of the nation. Several Canadian provinces are international members of the organization, as well. On 22 October 2011 he was chosen president of CSG for 2012.

====Center for Best Practices of the National Governors Association====
Between 2010 and 2012, Fortuño served on the board of directors of the Center for Best Practices of the National Governors Association.

====Chairman of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association====
On 21 August 2011, Governor Fortuño assumed the chairmanship of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association and unveiled his new initiative, which served as the organization&#x27;s policy focus for the year, to create jobs and spur economies in the Southern region by increasing trade, investment and exports with Latin America.

The initiative, titled &quot;Growth Beyond Our Borders,&quot; focused on creating jobs and increasing exports from Southern states and territories by the end of 2012 by enabling private sector businesses and entrepreneurs to tap into dynamic and emerging Latin American markets, which represent 550 million prospective clients.

The association&#x27;s membership is composed of the governors of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Virginia and West Virginia.

====Commemoration of Quincentenary of the Governorship of Puerto Rico====
In 2010, Fortuño created a Commission for the Celebration of the Quincentenary of the Governorship of Puerto Rico, a celebration that began on 12 October 2010 and will extend to 19 November 2011. As part of the celebration, at the tail-end of a Trade Mission to Spain, he led a celebration of the life of Puerto Rico&#x27;s first governor Juan Ponce de León in Santervás de Campos, near Valladolid on 21 January 2011. He also spoke that day at the Universidad de Valladolid.

====Constitutional amendments====
On 19 August 2012, voters rejected two constitutional amendments proposed by the governor and submitted by two-thirds of the Legislature for a referendum. The first amendment would have reduced the size of the Senate from 27 to 17 members and of the House of Representatives from 51 to 39 members. While the governor&#x27;s main opponent, PDP gubernatorial candidate, Senator Alejandro García Padilla supported the amendments, most PDP voters did not follow his lead and contributed to the defeat of both amendments, which was also opposed by the Puerto Rican Independence Party and three minor parties.

==Post-gubernatorial life==
On 9 January 2013, Fortuño presented his resignation to the presidency of the New Progressive Party, and accepted the party directorate&#x27;s request that he serve as the acting president until 3 February, when Pierluisi was selected to succeed Fortuño.

Fortuño and former first lady Lucé Vela moved to Washington, D.C., in early 2013. where he is a partner with the Steptoe &amp; Johnson law firm in its Corporate, Securities &amp; Finance Group and the Government Affairs and Public Policy Group. He is also involved in Steptoe&#x27;s Latin American practice.

Fortuno is a frequent speaker in forums related to business and conservative causes.

He supported libertarian candidate Javier Milei in 2023 Argentine general election.

<text>The Special Operations Force (SOF) is the primary special forces unit of the Singapore Army responsible for conducting special operations. The SOF is only composed of highly trained regular servicemen, most of whom are from the Commandos formation.

It is also a component of the Special Operations Task Force (SOTF), alongside the Special Warfare Group (SWG) of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).

==History==
On 27 September 1972, a flight engineer aboard Olympic Airlines Flight 472 accidentally activated a hijack alarm. The flight, which had 31 passengers and 11 crew members on board, took off from Sydney, Australia at 1030 hours SST and was heading towards Paya Lebar Airport in Singapore. The Australian authorities were not informed of the situation until four hours later. Following a flurry of conflicting reports, Australia&#x27;s Civil Aviation Safety Authority warned Paya Lebar Airport to be prepared for a possible hijack.

Flight 472 landed in Singapore at 1825 hours SST and was immediately surrounded by the police before the Singapore authorities could confirm that it was a false alarm. The incident highlighted the lack of special forces trained and equipped to deal with a hijack or hostage situation in Singapore.

The SOF was created in 1984.

===Operation Thunderbolt (1991)===
On 26 March 1991, Singapore Airlines Flight 117 was hijacked in flight by four men, who took all 129 people on board hostage. At Singapore Changi Airport, commandos from the SOF stormed the plane, killed the four hijackers and freed the hostages in under a minute. This also marked the SOF&#x27;s first combat operation.

Commando HQ was awarded a Medal of Valor and a unit citation for the success of the operation.

===Other operations===
It was reported that some SOF commandos have been deployed to Afghanistan under Operation Blue Ridge alongside regular Commandos.

<doc id="1129572" wikidata="Q918581" url="?curid=1129572" title="Social loafing">
<text>In social psychology, social loafing is the phenomenon of a person exerting less effort to achieve a goal when they work in a group than when working alone. It is seen as one of the main reasons groups are sometimes less productive than the combined performance of their members working as individuals.

Research on social loafing began with rope pulling experiments by Max Ringelmann, who found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone. In more recent research, studies involving modern technology, such as online and distributed groups, have also shown clear evidence of social loafing. Many of the causes of social loafing stem from individual members&#x27; feeling their individual effort will not matter to the group. This is seen as one of the main reasons groups are sometimes less productive than the combined performance of their members working as individuals, but should be distinguished from the accidental coordination problems that groups sometimes experience.

Several studies found the most prevalent motivational origins of social loafing to be the lack of an understanding of individual contributions, unchallenging tasks given to the individual, low personal satisfaction from the task, and lack of a united group. Theories investigating why social loafing occurs range from group members&#x27; feeling that their contributions will not be noticed to group members&#x27; realizing their efforts are not necessary. In a work setting, most managers agree if a task is new or complex that employees should work alone, while tasks that are well-known and have room for individual effort are better when done in groups.

In order to diminish social loafing from a group, several strategies could be put forward. Social loafing primarily happens when an individual unconsciously or consciously exerts less effort due to a decrease in social awareness. In order to counteract the likelihood of this happening, Miguel Herraez conducted a study on students where he used accountability and cooperation when unequal participation is found. The students were encouraged to provide equal participation in the work and to point out sources of conflict that could arise. The conclusion of the study found that providing support to the group members lacking in commitment and creating options for independence among group members lowered social loafing. The support for the weaker students improves their standing while also benefiting the other students.

==History==
===Rope-pulling experiments===

The first known research on the social loafing effect began in 1913 with Max Ringelmann&#x27;s study. He found that, when he asked a group of men to pull on a rope, they did not pull as hard collectively as they did when each was pulling alone. This research did not distinguish whether this was the result of the individuals in a group putting in less effort or of poor coordination within the group.

In 1974, Alan Ingham, James Graves, and colleagues replicated Ringelmann&#x27;s experiment using two types of group: 1) Groups with real participants in groups of various sizes (consistent with Ringelmann&#x27;s setup) or 2) Pseudo-groups with only one real participant. In the pseudo-groups, the researchers&#x27; assistants only pretended to pull on the rope. The results showed a decrease in the participants&#x27; performance. Groups of participants who all exerted effort exhibited the largest declines. Because the pseudo-groups were isolated from coordination effects (since the participant&#x27;s confederates did not physically pull the rope), Ingham proved that communication alone did not account for the effort decrease, and that motivational losses were the more likely cause of the performance decline.

===Clapping and shouting experiments===
In contrast with Ringelmann&#x27;s first findings, Bibb Latané et al. replicated previous social loafing findings while demonstrating that the decreased performance of groups was attributable to reduced individual effort, as distinct from a deterioration due to coordination. They showed this by blindfolding male college students while making them wear headphones that masked all noise. They then asked them to shout both in actual groups and pseudogroups in which they shouted alone but believed they were shouting with others. When subjects believed one other person was shouting, they shouted 82 percent as intensely as they did alone, but with five others, their effort decreased to 74 percent.

Latané et al. concluded that increasing the number of people in a group diminished the relative social pressure on each person: &quot;If the individual inputs are not identifiable the person may work less hard. Thus if the person is dividing up the work to be performed or the amount of reward he expects to receive, he will work less hard in groups.&quot;

===Meta-analysis study and the Collective Effort Model (CEM)===
In a 1993 meta-analysis, Karau and Williams proposed the &quot;Collective Effort Model (CEM)&quot;, which is used to generate predictions. The CEM integrates expectancy theories with theories of group-level social comparison and social identity to account for studies that examine individual effort in collective settings. From a psychological state, it proposes that Expectancy multiplied by Instrumentality multiplied by Valence of Outcome produces the resulting Motivational Force.

Karau, &quot;et al.&quot;, concluded that social loafing occurred because there was usually a stronger perceived contingency between individual effort and valued outcomes when working individually. When working collectively, other factors frequently determine performance, and valued outcomes are also divided among all group members. All individuals are assumed to try to maximize the expected utility of their actions. The CEM also acknowledges that some valued outcomes do not depend on performance. For example, exerting strong effort when working on intrinsically meaningful tasks or with highly respected team members may result in self-satisfaction or approval from the group, even if the high effort had little to no impact on tangible performance outcomes.

Notable or novel findings by Karau and Williams following their implementation of the CEM include:
* The magnitude of social loafing is reduced for women and individuals originating from Eastern cultures.
* Individuals are more likely to loaf when their co-workers are expected to perform well.
* Individuals reduce social loafing when working with acquaintances and do not loaf at all when they work in highly valued groups.

===Dispersed versus collocated groups===
A 2005 study by Laku Chidambaram and Lai Lai Tung based their research model on Latané&#x27;s social impact theory, and hypothesized that as group size and dispersion grew, the group&#x27;s work would be affected in the following areas: Members would contribute less in both quantity and quality, final group output would be of lower quality, and a group&#x27;s output would be affected both by individual factors and contextual factors.

A sample of 240 undergraduate business students was randomly split into forty teams (half of the teams were four-person and half eight-person) which were randomly assigned to either a co-located or distributed setting. The participants were to complete a task that asked them to act as a board of directors of a winery with an image problem. They were to find and discuss alternatives, and at the end submit their alternative with rationale. Co-located groups worked at a table together, while distributed groups did the same task at separate computers that allowed for electronic, networked communication. The same technology was used by both co-located and distributed groups.

Chidambaram and Tung found that group size mattered immensely in a group&#x27;s performance. The smaller the group, the more likely each member was to participate, regardless of range (dispersed or co-located). The main difference stated between distributed and co-located groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in co-located groups. When others are present, people feel the need to look as if they are working hard, while those who are not in the presence of others do not.

==Gender and social loafing==
In 1985, Gabrenya, Wang, and Latane found that in both Chinese and American cultures, social loafing varies between men and women. Women expressed less social loafing than men across different cultures. The authors argued that, regardless of the change in social roles, genetic and historical roles continue to make men more individualistic and women more relational.

In 1999, Naoki Kugihara conducted another study in Japan on social loafing tendencies using similar methods as Max Ringelmann&#x27;s rope-pulling experiment. He discovered that, when in a group, 40 percent more men exhibited less effort when performing the task than women, and attributed the difference to the tendency to have an interdependent self-concept.

==Effect of culture==
In 1989, Christopher P. Earley hypothesized that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that focused more on achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted a study in the United States and China, which are considered to be opposites in their cultural valuation of groups (with the U.S. being more individualistic and China being more collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each participant was given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.
It was found that, consistent with other studies, highly individualistic people performed more poorly on the task when there was high shared responsibility and low accountability than when there was high accountability. The collectivists, however, performed somewhat better on the task when high shared responsibility was present, regardless of how accountable they were supposed to be as compared to when they were working alone. This evidence suggests that collectivist thinking reduces the social loafing effect. Further evidence from a similar study showed the effect was related to the collectivist thinking rather than nationality, as &quot;individualistic&quot; Chinese workers did indeed show a social loafing effect.

==Causes==
===Diffusion of responsibility===
As the number of people in the group or team increase, people tend to feel deindividuation. This term defines both the dissociation from individual achievement and the decrease of personal accountability, resulting in lower exerted effort for individuals in collaborative environments. This phenomenon can thus decrease overall group effectiveness because it is contagious and hard to correct. Once identified by the group or team leader, it is their responsibility to reassess and put into motion new rules and expectations for everyone.

People could simply feel &quot;lost in the crowd&quot;, so they feel that their effort would not be rewarded even if they put it forth. This idea can also cause people to feel as though they can simply &quot;hide in the crowd&quot; and avoid the averse effects of not applying themselves.

When enthusiasm for the overall goal or task is diminished, overall contribution will drop. When one feels that their overall efforts are reduced or unimportant, they will likely become social loafers.

=== Motivation ===
Social psychological literature has found that the level of motivation one has to engage in an activity influences one&#x27;s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated are more likely to engage in social facilitation (that is, to increase one&#x27;s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are more likely to engage in social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual&#x27;s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual&#x27;s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.

Thus, a person&#x27;s attitude toward these two factors will influence his or her motivation level and subsequent group behavior. Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) found that motivation was highest when the individual believed that the goal was easily attainable and very valuable. On the other hand, motivation was lowest when the goal seemed impossible and not at all valuable.

Unfortunately, the presence of a group can influence one&#x27;s perception of these two factors in a number of ways. For instance, working in a group may reduce or increase one&#x27;s expectancy of attaining a goal. That is, depending on the qualities of the group members, an individual may find herself in a group of high achievers who work hard and are guaranteed success, whereas another may equally find himself in a group of lazy or distracted people, making success seem unattainable. Therefore, the link between one&#x27;s personal efforts and success is not direct, as our success is influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the value of the goal may be contingent on the group members. For instance, if we must share success with all other group members, then the value of the goal is reduced compared to the value of the goal from an individual perspective. Hence, the dynamic of the group is an important key in determining a person&#x27;s motivation and the likelihood of social loafing. Additional factors which have been found to influence the likelihood of social loafing include one&#x27;s gender, cultural background, and the complexity of the task.

===Dispensability of effort===
When a group member does not feel that his or her effort is justified in the context of the overall group, the individual will be less willing to expend the effort. If the group size is large, members can feel that their contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions can or should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups as they might have in smaller groups.

One example is voting in the United States. Even though most people say that voting is important, and a right that should be exercised, every election a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn out to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51 percent in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small in a group of millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to eliminate this effect.

===&quot;Sucker&quot; effect/Aversion===
Some people feel that others in the group will leave them to do all the work while they take the credit. Because people do not want to feel like the &quot;sucker&quot;, they wait to see how much effort others will put into a group before they put any in. If all the members try to avoid being the sucker, then everyone&#x27;s effort will be significantly less than it would be if all of them were working as hard as they could.

For example, in a workplace environment, the establishment of an absence culture creates an attitude that all employees deserve to have a certain number of days of absence, regardless of whether or not they are actually sick. Therefore, if an employee has not used the maximum number of absence days, &quot;he may feel that he is carrying an unfair share of the workload&quot;.

===Attribution and equity; matching of effort===
Jackson and Williams (1985) proposed that if someone feels that others in the group are slacking off or that others will loaf, he will lower his effort to match that of the others. This can occur whether it is apparent that the others are slacking or if someone simply believes that the group is slacking. For example, in the Latane, &quot;et al&quot;., study above, if a participant heard the others making less noise than anticipated, he could have lowered his effort in an attempt to equal that of the others, rather than aiming for the optimum.

===Submaximal goal setting===
By setting a goal that is based on maximization, people may feel that there is a set level that the group needs to be achieved. Because of this, they may feel they don&#x27;t need to work as hard for the overall desired effect.

For example, in the Latane &quot;et al.&quot; clapping and shouting study, people who were alone but told that they were part of a group screaming or clapping could have thought that there was a set level of noise that experimenters were looking for, and so assumed they could work less hard to achieve this level depending on the size of the group.

===Non-involvement===
Non-involvement social loafing has been linked to people the non-involvement of the members within the group Studies have shown that groups where the members were not personally involved in the project had a higher chance to experience social loafing. When members of a group can bring a contribution that is unique and that complements the project, loafing is highly unlikely to occur. That contribution could be considered unique, if each member had a specific task that only he or she could and would do that would contribute to the completion of the project. Authors from Texas Wesleyan University confirmed that “individuals are less likely to loaf when they feel the contribution is unique, and no other group member can contribute the skills to the task that they can.” Furthermore, when the project has a personal meaning to them, they are more involved and do not practice social loafing.

===Bystander Behavior===
Bystander behavior is the inhibiting influence of the presence of others on a person&#x27;s willingness to help someone in need. When the group&#x27;s size is large, there will be Bystander behavior. If someone is in trouble, people are less likely to help if other people are present. People assume someone else will help or take action. It has been noticed that even in emergencies, a bystander is less likely to help.

===Expectation===
An individual&#x27;s expectations will also affect their behavior; if the group size is large and they think people will slack off or not put in much effort, someone in the group may think, why should I make an effort. An individual&#x27;s expectations, if not fulfilled, can lead to a decrease in the productivity of the employees.

===In group and out group===
Social loafing can affect group cohesion and lead to an in-group and an outgroup. In groups are working hard to make much effort and contribute to the whole group&#x27;s success; the outgroup is those who are not contributing much and are lazy. It can lead to increased conflicts between employees conducting to decrease in productivity.

===Complex Goals===
Individuals sometimes don&#x27;t give much effort when they notice that the goals set by the management are complex and typical and are challenging to achieve. So when the group size is large, few employees don&#x27;t bother to give their full efforts to the projects.

===Achievable Goals===
The goals which are pretty short-term and straightforward and do not pose any challenge for the employees; they feel demotivated. Thus, showing minimal interest in achieving the goals.

===Inferiority Complex===
Employees who have fewer skills or are performing average are put in the group of top performers most of the time. Said employees will develop an inferiority complex, resulting in average employees depending on efficient team members for task accomplishment.

==Consequences of social loafing==
===Motivation===
Social loafing can have adverse effects on a group or an individual in the workplace. Some individuals can be seen as lazy or not team players. It can have an impact on the motivation of the whole group.

===Effect on Individuals===
Individuals within a group can also be affected by social loafing. Instead of focusing on excellence and achieving a goal, they may start to compare their effort with those around them. It can lower their feelings and satisfaction and potentially reduce their performance. If individuals feel that others are doing less work, perhaps relying on them, they might feel exploited and consequently reduce the amount of work they do; they become demotivated.

==Real-life instances==
===1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident===

On April 14, 1994, two U.S. Air Force F-15 fighters accidentally shot down two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters over northern Iraq, killing all 26 soldiers on board. The details of the incident were analyzed by West Point Professor Scott Snook in his book &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;.
In his summary of the fallacy of social redundancy, Snook points to social loafing as a contributor to the failure of the AWACS aircraft team to track the helicopters and prevent the shootdown. Snook asserts that responsibility was &quot;spread so thin by the laws of social impact and confused authority relationships that no one felt compelled to act&quot;.

===Social loafing and the workplace===
According to Hwee Hoon Tan and Min-Li Tan, social loafing is an important area of interest in order to understand group work. While the opposite of social loafing, &quot;organizational citizenship behavior&quot;, can create significant productivity increases, both of these behaviors can significantly impact the performance of organizations. Social loafing is a behavior that organizations want to eliminate. Understanding how and why people become social loafers is critical to the effective functioning, competitiveness and effectiveness of an organization.

There are certain examples of social loafing in the workplace that are discussed by James Larsen in his essay &quot;Loafing on the Job&quot;. For example, builders working vigorously on a construction site while some of their colleagues are lounging on rock walls or leaning on their shovels doing nothing. Another example is a restaurant such as McDonald&#x27;s where some employees lounge about while others are eager to take an order. These scenarios all express the problems that social loafing creates in a workplace, and businesses seek to find a way to counteract these trends.

Larsen mentions ways that a business could change its operations in order to fight the negative effects of social loafing. For one, research has shown that if each employee has his performance individually measured, he will put in more effort than if it were not measured. Another person interested in the idea of social loafing is Kenneth Price, from the University of Texas. Price conducted a social loafing experiment in order to examine whether two key factors that he suspected played a role in the way social loafing arose in work groups. These two factors were dispensability and fairness. The experiment that he conducted involved 514 people who were divided into 144 teams that were set to meet for fourteen weeks. The projects assigned to these people were complex and called for diverse skills from many different individuals in order to be fully completed. The experiments findings did in fact corroborate Price&#x27;s suspicions in the two factors of dispensability and fairness.

Dispensability in a group is described by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to gauge their skills vis à vis their co-workers. If they perceive that their skills are inferior to those around them, they tend to sit back and let the more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness in a group is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision-making because of their ethnicity, gender or other arbitrary factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.

===Online communities and groups===
A 2008 study of 227 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in web-enabled courses at the Naval War College (NWC) and a public university found that social loafing not only exists, but may also be prevalent in the online learning classroom. Although only 2 percent of NWC and 8 percent of public university students self-reported social loafing, 8 percent of NWC and 77 percent of public university students sensed that others engaged in social loafing. Additional findings generally verify face-to-face social loafing findings from previous studies. The researchers concluded that injustice in the distribution of rewards increases social loafing, and suggest that self-perceived dominance negatively affects individual participation in group activities.

Social loafing, also known as &quot;lurking&quot;, greatly affects the development and growth of online communities. The term &quot;social loafing&quot; refers to the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually. This phenomenon is much like people&#x27;s tendency to be part of a group project, but rely heavily on just a few individuals to complete the work. Generally, social loafers regularly follow the discussions and content of online communities, but choose not to expand on posts or add to the knowledge of the community. Additionally, participation in online communities is usually voluntary; therefore there is no guarantee that community members will contribute to the knowledge of the website, discussion forum, bulletin board, or other form of online engagement. Lurkers are reported to constitute over 90 percent of several online groups.

The main reason people choose not to contribute to online communities surprisingly does not have to do with societal laziness, but in fact the potential contributors belief that their entries will not be taken seriously or given the credit that they deserve. When people assess the risks involved in contributing to online communities, they generally avoid participation because of the uncertainty of who the other contributors and readers are and the fear of their work being undervalued.

====Age-related effects on participation====
Although studies justify the notion that people often do not contribute to online communities, some research shows that older adults are more likely to participate in online communities than younger people because different generations tend to use the internet differently. For example, &quot;older adults are more likely to seek health information, make purchases, and obtain religious information, but less likely to watch videos, download music, play games, and read blogs online&quot;. This is perhaps due in part to the fact that some online communities cater to older generations. The content of the website often determines what age group will use or visit the site, and because many forms of online communities appear on sites that focus their attention on older adults, participation is generally higher. Additionally, the ease and availability of operating the websites that host the online community may play a role in the age group that is most likely to participate. For example, some online communities geared toward older adults have simplified the design of their sites in order to enhance their look and usability for older adults.

==Reduction==
According to Dan J. Rothwell, it takes &quot;the three Cs of motivation&quot; to get a group moving: collaboration, content, and choice. Thus, the answer to social loafing may be motivation. A competitive environment may not necessarily motivate group members.

#&quot;Collaboration&quot; is a way to get everyone involved in the group by assigning each member special, meaningful tasks. It is a way for the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will make them feel essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to want to let the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.
#&quot;Content&quot; identifies the importance of the individual&#x27;s specific tasks within the group. If group members see their role as that involved in completing a worthy task, then they are more likely to fulfill it. For example, Sally may enjoy brainstorming, as she knows that she will bring a lot to the group if she fulfills this obligation. She feels that her obligation will be valued by the group.
#&quot;Choice&quot; gives the group members the opportunity to choose the task they want to fulfill. Assigning roles in a group causes complaints and frustration. Allowing group members the freedom to choose their role makes social loafing less significant, and encourages the members to work together as a team.

Thompson stresses that ability and motivation are essential, but insufficient for effective team functioning. A team must also coordinate the skills, efforts, and actions of its members in order to effectively achieve its goal. Thompson&#x27;s recommendations can be separated into &quot;motivation strategies&quot; and &quot;coordination strategies&quot;:
===Motivational strategies===

==== Increase identifiability ====
Studies of social loafing suggest that people are less productive when they are working with others, but social facilitation studies have shown that people are more productive when others are present (at least with an easy task). If individuals in a group know one another, feel that their productivity or inputs are not identifiable, then social loafing is likely to occur. Alternatively, if individuals are anonymous and therefore unidentifiable, then social loafing may also be likely to occur.

==== Minimize free riding ====
&quot;Free riding&quot; occurs when members do less work because some of the benefits accrue to others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may feel less motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is important to make group members feel that their contributions are essential for the group&#x27;s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.

==== Promote involvement ====
Loafing is also less likely to occur when people are involved with their work, and when they enjoy working with others in groups. These are people who value both the experience of being part of a group, as well as achieving results. Also, challenging and difficult tasks reduce social loafing. Social loafing is also reduced when individuals are involved in group work and their rewards are received as a team, rather than individually.

==== Strengthen team cohesion ====
The extent to which group members identify with their group also determines the amount of social loafing. This concept links with social identity theory in that that difference between a hard-working group and one that is loafing is the match between the group&#x27;s tasks and its members’ self definitions. When individuals derive their sense of self and identity from their membership, social loafing is replaced by social laboring (members will expand extra effort for their group).

==== Set goals ====
Groups that set clear, challenging goals outperform groups whose members have lost sight of their objectives. The group&#x27;s goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is so easy that it can be accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke&#x27;s theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the forest to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60 percent of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94 percent of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, the results of this study show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.

==== Individual assessment ====
In order to reduce social loafing, a company can always focus on assessing each members contribution rather than only examining the teams accomplishments as a whole. It is statistically proven that social loafers will tend to put in less effort because of the lack of external or internal assessment of their contributions. This leads to less self-awareness in the group because the team together is the only body evaluated (Curt. 2007).

==== Personal tasks, roles, and responsibilities ====
One strategy to avoid social loafing is giving individuals personal tasks and responsibilities. If individuals know they are responsible for certain things or specific charges within the group, they know their eyes are on them and are more likely to complete them. As they see, they are responsible for these tasks.

==== Standards and Rules ====
Setting deadlines assigning responsibilities and tasks can ensure individuals are more likely to contribute to group efforts. Make sure everyone in a group follows the rules and regulations and everyone works up to the set standards.

==== Team Loyalty ====
Encouraging team loyalty can improve the performance of everyone in the group. It may be hard to achieve and does require careful handling by the team leader, encouraging everyone to want to be a part of a team and want to be performed as part of a team. For example: Offering rewards for the whole group if the entire team achieves goals.

==== Small Group Sizes ====
Minimize free-riding by making a group as small as possible. Social loafing occurs less when groups are kept small between three and five people. Social loafing is more evident if someone in the group is not making much effort as the other team members are. If group size is fewer employees, they will need to contribute more as there is no extra help around.

==== Peer Evaluation ====
Peer evaluation is considered a way of reducing social loafing because when group members are able to go over each other&#x27;s works and criticize or comment on them, it makes group members realize that they will be on the spot if they do not work on their project and that at the same time, there will be repercussions. That will encourage them to engage themselves more deeply into their work. Peer evaluation can also be seen as a productive and an efficient way to give constructive feedback. There are several ways you can incorporate feedback, whether it is to have each member present the results of their work at intervals, conduct regular feedback sessions, or even having group members.

===Encouraging contributions in online communities===
Piezon and Donaldson argue in a 2005 analysis that special attention should be paid to the physical separation, social isolation, and temporal distance associated with distance education courses, which may induce social loafing. In terms of group size, they assert that there is no significant gain in small groups larger than six unless the group is brainstorming, and that the optimal group size may be five members. Suggestions that they have for online groups include clarifying roles and responsibilities, providing performance data for comparison with other groups, and mandating high levels of participation consisting of attending group meetings, using the discussion board, and participating in chats.

In a 2010 analysis of online communities, Kraut and Resnick suggest several ways to elicit contributions from users:
* Simply asking users, either implicitly through selective presentation of tasks or explicitly through requests that play on the principles of persuasion
* Changing the composition or activity of the group
* Using a record-keeping system to reflect member contributions, in addition to awarding privileges or more tangible awards. An example that the authors study is Wikipedia, which runs fundraising campaigns that involve tens of thousands of people and raise millions of dollars by employing large banner ads at the top of the page with deadlines, specific amounts of money set as the goal, and lists of contributors.

===Reduction in group projects===
In 2008, Praveen Aggarwal and Connie O&#x27;Brien studied several hundred college students assessing what factors can reduce social loafing during group projects. From the results, they concluded that there were three factors that reduce social loafing:

Limiting the scope of the project: Instructors can reduce social loafing by either dividing a big project into two or more smaller components or replacing semester-long projects with a smaller project and some other graded work. Also, breaking up a big project into smaller components can be beneficial. For example, allocating responsibility so that each individual is spearheading certain aspects of a larger project ensures accountability and helps prevent social loafing.

Smaller group size: Limiting the group size can make it harder for social loafers to hide behind the shield of anonymity provided by a large group. In smaller groups, each member will feel that their contribution will add greater value.

Peer evaluations: Peer evaluations send a signal to group members that there will be consequences for non-participation. It has been found that as the number of peer evaluations during a project go up, the incidence of social loafing goes down.

<text>Arbury Hall () is a Grade I listed country house in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, and the ancestral home of the Newdigate family, later the Newdigate-Newdegate and Fitzroy-Newdegate (Viscount Daventry) families.

==History==
The hall is built on the site of the former Arbury Priory in a mixture of Tudor and 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture, the latter being the work of Sir Roger Newdigate from designs by Henry Keene.

The 19th-century author George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) was born on one of the estate farms in 1819, the daughter of the estate&#x27;s land agent.

In 1911, Sir Francis Alexander Newdigate Newdegate erected, at Arbury Hall, a monument to the memory of George Eliot.

==Description==
The hall is set in of parkland.

==In the arts==
George Eliot immortalised Arbury Hall as &quot;Cheverel Manor&quot; in &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;, where it is the setting for &quot;Mr Gilfil&#x27;s Love Story&quot;.

The film &quot;Angels &amp; Insects&quot; (1995) was shot entirely at Arbury Hall and within the grounds.

Arbury Hall was also used as the fictional Hoxley Manor in the BBC TV series &quot;Land Girls&quot; (2009).

==Ownership==
*Edmund Anderson (1530–1605), who demolished the priory and built Arbury Hall.

Custodians of Arbury Hall include:

*Sir Edmund Anderson (1567–1586)
*John Newdegate (1586–1587)
*Sir John Newdegate (1587–1610)

<doc id="1129601" wikidata="Q1156881" url="?curid=1129601" title="Ad blocking">
<text>Ad blocking or ad filtering is a software capability for blocking or altering online advertising in a web browser, an application or a network. This may be done using browser extensions or other methods or browsers with inside blocking.

==History==
The first ad blocker was Internet Fast Forward, a plugin for the Netscape Navigator browser, developed by PrivNet and released in 1996. The AdBlock extension for Firefox was developed in 2002, with Adblock Plus being released in 2006. uBlock Origin, originally called &quot;uBlock&quot;, was first released in 2014.

==Technologies and native countermeasures==
Online advertising exists in a variety of forms, including web banners, pictures, animations, embedded audio and video, text, or pop-up windows, and can even employ audio and video autoplay. Many browsers offer some ways to remove or alter advertisements: either by targeting technologies that are used to deliver ads (such as embedded content delivered through browser plug-ins or via HTML5), targeting URLs that are the source of ads, or targeting behaviors characteristic of ads (such as the use of HTML5 AutoPlay of both audio and video).

==Prevalence==
Use of mobile and desktop ad blocking software designed to remove traditional advertising grew by 41% worldwide and by 48% in the U.S. between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015. As of Q2 , 45 million Americans were using ad blockers. In a survey research study released Q2 2016, Met Facts reported 72 million Americans, 12.8 million adults in the UK, and 13.2 million adults in France were using ad blockers on their PCs, smartphones, or tablet computers. In March 2016, the Internet Advertising Bureau reported that UK ad blocking was already at 22% among people over 18 years old.

, 27% of US Internet users used ad blocking software, a trend that has been increasing since 2014.

Among technical audiences the rate of blocking reached 58% as of .

==Benefits==
For users, benefits of ad blocking software include quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions, protection from malvertising, stopping intrusive actions from ads, reducing the amount of data downloaded by the user, lower power consumption, privacy benefits gained through the exclusion of web tracking, and preventing undesirable websites from making ad revenue out of the user&#x27;s visit.

Publishers and their representative trade bodies, on the other hand, argue that web ads provide revenue to website owners, which enable the website owners to create or otherwise purchase content for the website. Publishers state that the prevalent use of ad blocking software and devices could adversely affect website owner revenue.

===User experience===
Ad blocking software may have other benefits to users&#x27; quality of life, as it decreases Internet users&#x27; exposure to advertising and marketing industries, which promote the purchase of numerous consumer products and services that are potentially harmful or unhealthy and on creating the urge to buy immediately. The average person sees more than 5000 advertisements daily, many of which are from online sources.

Unwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if users become annoyed by the ads. Irritated users might make a conscious effort to avoid the goods and services of firms which are using annoying &quot;pop-up&quot; ads which block the Web content the user is trying to view. For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also save time. Any ad that appears on a website exerts a toll on the user&#x27;s &quot;attention budget&quot; since each ad enters the user&#x27;s field of view and must either be consciously ignored or closed, or dealt with in some other way. A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that they are seeking likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services. In contrast, users who are actively seeking items to purchase might appreciate advertising, in particular targeted ads.

===Security===
Another important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects users to a higher risk of infecting their devices with computer viruses than surfing pornography websites. In a high-profile case, the malware was distributed through advertisements provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google&#x27;s Doubleclick. In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in an advertisement on a website. When Forbes required users to disable ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately served with pop-under malware. The Australian Signals Directorate recommends individuals and organizations block advertisements to improve their information security posture and mitigate potential malvertising attacks and machine compromise. The information security firm Webroot also notes employing ad blockers provides effective countermeasures against malvertising campaigns for less technically sophisticated computer users. Ad blocking is recommended by the FBI to prevent online scams.

===Monetary===
Ad blocking reduces page load time and saves bandwidth for the users. Users who pay for total transferred bandwidth (&quot;capped&quot; or pay-for-usage connections), including most mobile users worldwide, have a direct financial benefit from filtering an ad before it is loaded. Using an ad blocker is a common method of improving internet speeds. Analysis of the 200 most popular news sites (as ranked by Alexa) in 2015 showed that Mozilla Firefox Tracking Protection led to a 39% reduction in data usage and a 44% median reduction in page load time. According to research performed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, ad blockers reduced data consumption and sped upload time by more than half on 50 news sites, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; itself. Journalists concluded that &quot;visiting the home page of Boston.com (the site with most ad data in the study) every day for a month would cost the equivalent of about $9.50 in data usage just for the ads&quot;.

It is a known problem with most web browsers, including Firefox, that restoring sessions often plays multiple embedded ads at once. However, this annoyance can easily be averted simply by setting the web browser to clear all cookies and browsing-history information each time the browser software is closed. Another preventive option is to use a script blocker, which enables the user to disable all scripts and then to selectively re-enable certain scripts as desired, in order to determine the role of each script. The user thus can very quickly learn which scripts are truly necessary (from the standpoint of webpage functionality) and consequently which sources of scripts are undesirable, and this insight is helpful in visiting other websites in general. Thus by precisely controlling which scripts are run in each webpage viewed, the user retains full control over what happens on their computer CPU and computer screen.

==Methods==
One method of filtering is simply to block (or prevent auto play of) Flash animation or image loading or Microsoft Windows audio and video files. This can be done in most browsers easily and also improves security and privacy. This crude technological method is refined by numerous browser extensions. Every web browser handles this task differently, but, in general, one alters the options, preferences or application extensions to filter specific media types. An additional add-on is usually required to differentiate between ads and non-ads using the same technology, or between wanted and unwanted ads or behaviors.

The more advanced ad-blocking filter software allows fine-grained control of advertisements through features such as blacklists, whitelists, and regular expression filters. Certain security features also have the effect of disabling some ads. Some antivirus software can act as an ad blocker. Filtering by intermediaries such as ISP providers or national governments is increasingly common.

===Browser integration===
, many web browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads automatically. Current versions of Konqueror, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox also include content filtering support out-of-the-box. Content filtering can be added to Firefox, Chromium-based browsers, Opera, Safari, and other browsers with extensions such as AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin, and a number of sources provide regularly updated filter lists. Adblock Plus is included in the freeware browser Maxthon from the People&#x27;s Republic of China by default.

Another method for filtering advertisements uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules to hide specific HTML and XHTML elements. This was once handled directly by a browser&#x27;s user style sheet and custom CSS files. The CSS files employed regular expressions to describe a general advertisement profile. An example CSS selector from the once popular Floppy Moose (2003) style sheet is below. It simply hides anything with a link containing the characters &quot;ad.&quot;

a:link[href*=&quot;ad.&quot;] img

Stylesheets are still used to block ads today. However they are almost always used by an ad-blocking extension that combines CSS with other techniques. AdBlock Plus syntax includes CSS selectors which they call &quot;element hiding&quot; rules. The newer uBlock Origin even allows &quot;cosmetic filters&quot; which inject custom CSS declarations. Due to changes in advertising techniques, modern ad-blockers use more specific selectors, more frequently updated selectors, and a greater quantity of selectors. For example, the Floppy Moose style sheet originally contained 40 lines of CSS. In 2022, Easylist contains thousands of CSS selectors. In contrast to the general example above, below is one of the many specific CSS selectors from Easylist (2022).

In January 2016, Brave, a free, ad-blocking browser for Mac, PC, Android, and iOS devices was launched. Brave users can optionally enable Brave&#x27;s own ad network to earn Basic Attention Tokens (BATs), a type of cryptocurrency, which can be sent as micro-payments to publishers.

At the beginning of 2018, Google confirmed that the built-in ad blocker for the Chrome/Chromium browsers would go live on 15 February: this ad blocker only blocks certain ads as specified by the &quot;Better Ads Standard&quot; (defined by the Coalition for &quot;Better Ads&quot;, in which Google itself is a board member). This built-in ad blocking mechanism is disputed because it could unfairly benefit Google&#x27;s advertising itself.

In 2019, both Apple and Google began to make changes to their web browsers&#x27; extension systems which encourage the use of declarative content blocking using pre-determined filters processed by the web browser, rather than filters processed at runtime by the extension. Both vendors have imposed limits on the number of entries that may be included in these lists, which have led to (especially in the case of Chrome) allegations that these changes are being made to inhibit the effectiveness of ad blockers.

===External programs===

A number of external software applications offer ad filtering as a primary or additional feature. A traditional solution is to customize an HTTP proxy (or web proxy) to filter content. These programs work by caching and filtering content before it is displayed in a user&#x27;s browser. This provides an opportunity to remove not only ads but also content that may be offensive, inappropriate, or even malicious (Drive-by download). Popular proxy software which blocks content effectively include Netnanny, Privoxy, Squid, and some content-control software. The main advantage of the method is freedom from implementation limitations (browser, working techniques) and centralization of control (the proxy can be used by many users). Proxies are very good at filtering ads, but they have several limitations compared to browser-based solutions. For proxies, it is difficult to filter Transport Layer Security (SSL) (codice_1) traffic and full webpage context is not available to the filter. As well, proxies find it difficult to filter JavaScript-generated ad content.

===Hosts file and DNS manipulation===
Most operating systems, even those which are aware of the Domain Name System (DNS), still offer backward compatibility with a locally administered list of foreign hosts. This configuration, for historical reasons, is stored in a flat text file that by default contains very few hostnames and their associated IP addresses. Editing this hosts file is simple and effective because most DNS clients will read the local hosts file before querying a remote DNS server. Storing black-hole entries in the hosts file prevents the browser from accessing an ad server by manipulating the name resolution of the ad server to a local or nonexistent IP address (codice_2 or codice_3 are typically used for IPv4 addresses). While simple to implement, these methods can be circumvented by advertisers, either by hard-coding, the IP address of the server that hosts the ads (this, in its turn, can be worked around by changing the local routing table by using for example iptables or other blocking firewalls), or by loading the advertisements from the same server that serves the main content; blocking name resolution of this server would also block the useful content of the site.

Using a DNS sinkhole by manipulating the hosts file exploits the fact that most operating systems store a file with IP address, domain name pairs which is consulted by most browsers before using a DNS server to look up a domain name. By assigning the loopback address to each known ad server, the user directs traffic intended to reach each ad server to the local machine or to a virtual black hole of /dev/null or bit bucket.

===DNS filtering===
Advertising can be blocked by using a DNS server which is configured to block access to domains or hostnames which are known to serve ads by spoofing the address. Users can choose to use an already modified DNS server or set up a dedicated device running adequate software such as a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole themselves. Manipulating DNS is a widely employed method to manipulate what the end-user sees from the Internet but can also be deployed locally for personal purposes. China runs its own root DNS and the EU has considered the same. Google has required their Google Public DNS be used for some applications on its Android devices. Accordingly, DNS addresses/domains used for advertising may be extremely vulnerable to a broad form of ad substitution whereby a domain that serves ads is entirely swapped out with one serving more local ads to some subset of users. This is especially likely in countries, notably Russia, India and China, where advertisers often refuse to pay for clicks or page views. DNS-level blocking of domains for non-commercial reasons is already common in China.

===Recursive Local VPN===
On Android, apps can run a local VPN connection with its own host filtering ability and DNS address without requiring root access. This approach allows ad blocking app to download ad blocking host files and use them to filter out ad networks throughout the device. AdGuard, Blokada, DNS66, and RethinkDNS are few of the popular apps which accomplish ad blocking without root permission. The ad blocking is only active when the local VPN is turned on, and it completely stops when the VPN connection is disconnected. The convenience makes it easy to access content blocked by anti-adblock scripts.

This approach optimizes battery usage, reduces internet slowdown caused by using external DNS or VPN ad blocking and needs overall less configuration.

===Hardware devices===
Devices such as AdTrap or Pi-hole use hardware to block Internet advertising. Based on reviews of AdTrap, this device uses a Linux Kernel running a version of PrivProxy to block ads from video streaming, music streaming, and any web browser, while PiHole acts as a local DNS to block advertisement servers, stopping connected devices from showing most ads. Another such solution is provided for network-level ad blocking for telcos by Israeli startup Shine.

===By external parties and internet providers===

Internet providers, especially mobile operators, frequently offer proxies designed to reduce network traffic. Even when not targeted specifically at ad filtering, these proxy-based arrangements will block many types of advertisements that are too large or bandwidth-consuming, or that are otherwise deemed unsuited for the specific internet connection or target device. Many internet operators block some form of advertisements while at the same time injecting their own ads promoting their services and specials.

==Economic consequences for online business==
Some content providers have argued that widespread ad blocking results in decreased revenue to a website sustained by advertisements and e-commerce-based businesses, where this blocking can be detected.

==Business models==
Tools that help block ads have to work on different business models to stay in operation:

* Free and open source: Several tools work under a FOSS model, powered by community contributions and donations, e.g. uBlock Origin.
* Whitelisting: Some companies maintain a whitelist of websites that allow &quot;acceptable ads&quot; in exchange for a share of ad revenue.
* Subscription/Upfront: Some companies offer a subscription or upfront payment model for adblocking tools, e.g. Wipr.
* Freemium: Some companies offer some level of service for free while charging for additional features, e.g. AdGuard.

==Response from publishers==

===Countermeasures===
Some websites have taken countermeasures against ad blocking software, such as attempting to detect the presence of ad blockers and informing users of their views, or outright preventing users from accessing the content unless they disable the ad blocking software, whitelist the website, or buy an &quot;ad-removal pass&quot;. There have been several arguments supporting and opposing the assertion that blocking ads is wrong. Indeed, there is evidence to show that these countermeasures may hurt a website&#x27;s SEO performance, as users unwilling to turn off their AdBlock may instead go to a competitor&#x27;s website listed in the search results. Due to the little amount of time the user spends on the website, and the greater time spent on a competitor&#x27;s, search engines may view the webpage less favourably and reduce its search ranking. The back-and-forth elevation of technologies used for ad-blocking and countering ad-blocking have been equated to an &quot;ad blocking war&quot; or &quot;arms race&quot; between all parties.

It has been suggested that in the European Union, the practice of websites scanning for ad blocking software may run afoul of the E-Privacy Directive. This claim was further validated by IAB Europe&#x27;s guidelines released in June 2016 stating that there indeed may be a legal issue in ad blocker detection. While some anti-blocking stakeholders have tried to refute this it seems safe to assume that Publishers should follow the guidelines provided by the main Publisher lobby IAB.

In August 2017, a vendor, Admiral, of such counter-measures issued a demand under section 1201 of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to demand the removal of a domain name associated with their service from an ad-blocking filter list. The vendor argued that the domain constituted a component of a technological protection measure designed to protect a copyrighted work, and thus made it a violation of anti-circumvention law to frustrate access to it.

In September 2023, after a period of testing that began in May 2023, the American video hosting site YouTube began launching countermeasures at viewers with adblocker software running when viewing videos. A popup message appears warning the user is breaking the terms of service and may experience blocked viewing after three videos unless they whitelist the site, or purchase YouTube Premium. This sparked extreme controversy and backlash across the YouTube communities. In October 2023, privacy advocate Alexander Hanff filed a criminal complaint against YouTube under Irish jurisdiction due to its ad blocking detection script, which is believed to violate European Union privacy laws. In June 2024, YouTube began experimenting with server-side ad insertion, which consists of embedding ads directly into video streams, making automatic blocking significantly more difficult.

===Alternatives===
, advertisers and marketers look to involve their brands directly into the entertainment with native advertising and product placement (also known as brand integration or embedded marketing). An example of product placement would be for a soft drink manufacturer to pay a reality TV show producer to have the show&#x27;s cast and host appear onscreen holding cans of the soft drink. Another common product placement is for an automotive manufacturer to give free cars to the producers of a TV show, in return for the show&#x27;s producer depicting characters using these vehicles during the show.

Some digital publications turned to their customers for help as a form of tip jar. For example, &quot;The Guardian&quot; is asking its readers for donations to help offset falling advertising revenue. According to the newspaper&#x27;s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, the newspaper gets about the same amount of money from membership and donations as it does from advertising. The newspaper considered preventing readers from accessing its content if usage of ad-blocking software becomes widespread, but so far it keeps the content accessible for readers who employ ad-blockers.

A new service called Scroll, launched in January 2020, worked with several leading website publishers to create a subscription model for ad-free browsing across all supported websites. Users would pay Scroll directly, and portions of the subscription fees are doled out to the websites based on proportional view count.

<text>You&#x27;re Only Lonely is the third album by American singer-songwriter JD Souther, released in 1979. The title song charted as a single on &quot;Billboard&quot;, reaching No.1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;White Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; was covered by Linda Ronstadt on her album &quot;Living in the USA&quot;. In 1992, George Strait covered &quot;The Last in Love&quot;, for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Pure Country&quot;. 

==Reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;Souther&#x27;s trouble is that his voice simply isn&#x27;t very interesting, at least in a folk-rock context on recording.&quot;

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann praised &quot;White Rhythm and Blues&quot; as well as the solo version of the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band song &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;.

<text>Altix is a line of server computers and supercomputers produced by Silicon Graphics (and successor company Silicon Graphics International), based on Intel processors. It succeeded the MIPS/IRIX-based Origin 3000 servers.
==History==
The line was first announced on January 7, 2003, with the Altix 3000 series, based on Intel Itanium 2 processors and SGI&#x27;s NUMAlink processor interconnect.
At product introduction, the system supported up to 64 processors running Linux as a single system image and shipped with a Linux distribution called SGI Advanced Linux Environment, which was compatible with Red Hat Advanced Server.

By August 2003, many SGI Altix customers were running Linux on 128- and 256-processor SGI Altix systems. SGI officially announced 256-processor support within a single system image of Linux on March 10, 2004, using a 2.4-based Linux kernel. The SGI Advanced Linux Environment was eventually dropped after support using a standard, unmodified SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) distribution for SGI Altix was provided with SLES 8 and SLES 9.

Later, SGI Altix 512-processor systems were officially supported using an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 9 SP1. Besides full support of SGI Altix on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, a standard and unmodified Red Hat Enterprise Linux was also fully supported starting with SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 with RHEL 4 and RHEL 5 with system processor limits defined by Red Hat for those releases.

On November 14, 2005, SGI introduced the Altix 4000 series based on the Itanium 2. The Altix 3000 and 4000 are distributed shared memory multiprocessors. SGI later officially supported 1024-processor systems on an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 10 in July 2006. SGI Altix 4700 was also officially supported by Red Hat with RHEL 4 and RHEL 5 — maximum processor limits were as defined by Red Hat for its RHEL releases.

The Altix brand was used for systems based on multi-core Intel Xeon processors. These include the Altix XE rackmount servers, Altix ICE blade servers and Altix UV supercomputers.

NASA&#x27;s Columbia supercomputer, installed in 2004 and decommissioned in 2013, was a 10240-microprocessor cluster of twenty Altix 3000 systems, each with 512 microprocessors, interconnected with InfiniBand.

== Altix 3000 ==

The Altix 3000 is the first generation of Altix systems. It was succeeded by the Altix 4000 in 2004, and the last model was discontinued on December 31, 2006.

The Altix 330 is an entry-level server. Unlike the high-end models, the Altix 330 is not &quot;brick&quot; based, but is instead based on 1U-high compute modules mounted in a rack and connected with NUMAlink. A single system may contain 1 to 16 Itanium 2 processors and 2 to 128 GB of memory.

The Altix 1330 is a cluster of Altix 330 systems. The systems are networked with Gigabit Ethernet or 4X InfiniBand.

The Altix 350 is a mid-range model that supports up to 32 Itanium 2 processors. Introduced in 2005, it runs Linux, rather than SGI&#x27;s own Unix variant, IRIX. The Altix 350 is scalable from one to thirty-two 64-bit Intel Itanium processors. It features DDR SDRAM and PCI-X expansion ports, and can support SCSI or SATA internal hard drives. Designed as a rack-mount server, the Altix 350 is 2U, meaning it occupies two slots vertically in a standard server rack. The Altix 1350 is a cluster of Altix 350 systems.

, the Altix 350 was superseded by the Altix 450 (based on the Itanium 2) and the Altix XE (based on the Xeon).

The Altix 3300 is a mid-range model supporting 4 to 12 processors and 2 to 48 GB of memory. It is packaged in a short (17U) rack.

The Altix 3700 is a high-end model supporting 16 to 512 processors and 8 GB to 2 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (39U) rack (s). A variant of the Altix 3000 with graphics capability is known as the Prism.

The 3700 is based on the third generation NUMAflex distributed shared memory architecture and it uses the NUMAlink 4 interconnection fabric. The Altix 3000 supports a single system image of 64 processors. If there are more than 64 processors in a system, then the system must be partitioned.

The basic building block is called a C-brick, which contains two nodes in a 4U high rackmount unit. Each node contains two Intel Itanium 2 processors that connect to the Super-Bedrock application-specific integrated circuit through a single front-side bus. The Super-Bedrock is a crossbar switch for the processors, the local RAM, the network interface and the I/O interface. The two Super-Bedrock ASICs in each brick are connected internally by a single 6.4 GB/s NUMAlink 4 channel. A processor node also contains 16 DIMM slots that accept standard DDR DIMMs with capacities of 4 to 16 GB.

The Altix 3700 Bx2 is a high-end model supporting 16 to 2,048 Itanium 2 processors and 12 GB to 24 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (40U) racks.

== Altix 4000 ==

The Altix 4000 is the next Itanium-based product line. It has two models, the Altix 450 a mid-range server, and the Altix 4700 a high-end server.

An Altix 4700 system contains up to 2048 dual-core Itanium 2 and Itanium (&quot;Montvale&quot; revision) microprocessor sockets, connected by the NUMAlink 4 interconnect in a fat tree network topology. The microprocessors are accompanied by up to 128 TB of memory (192 TB with single microprocessor socket blades and 16 GB DIMMs).

Each node is contained within a blade that plugs into an enclosure, the individual rack unit (IRU). The IRU is a 10U enclosure that contains the necessary components to support the blades such as the power supplies, two router boards (one for every five blades) and a L1 controller. Each IRU can support ten single-wide blades or two double-wide blades and eight single-width blades. The IRUs are mounted in 42U-high rack, and each rack supports up to four IRUs.

Two types of node, processor and memory, are contained within a blade. Compute blades contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) (chipset) and eight dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slots for memory. The number of microprocessor sockets in a compute blade is one or two. One-processor socket configurations provide more bandwidth as only one microprocessor socket is using the front side bus and local memory. Two-processor socket configurations do not support hyperthreading. Memory blades are used to expand the amount of memory without increasing the number of processors. They contain a SHub ASIC and 12 DIMM slots. Both compute and memory blades support 1, 2 4, 8, and 16 GB DIMMs. SGI support does not support any installations with 16 GB DIMMs.

Multiple servers can be combined on the same Numalink fabric up to the theoretical maximum of 8,192 nodes (16,384 OS CPUs).

== Altix XE ==

The Altix XE servers use Intel Xeon x86-64-architecture processors. Models include:

* The Altix XE210 server supports up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32 GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, 1 x PCIe x8 (low profile) and 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height) PCI slots, and Three SATA/SAS drive bays.
* The Altix XE240 server supports up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32 GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, two PCI slots configuration options (option 1: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 2 x PCIe x4 (full height), 1 x PCEe x8 (full height); or option 2: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 3 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), and Five SATA/SAS drive bays.

* The Altix XE320 server
* The Altix XE340 server contains 2 compute nodes within a 1U configuration, Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, Choice of up to 12 DDR3 DIMMs per node (2 GB, 4 GB, or 8 GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 (1 per node) - low profile PCI slot, and Four SATA drive bays (2 per node) with optional SAS and hardware RAID 0, 1.
* The Altix XE500 server is a 3U configuration with Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, with a choice of up to 18 DDR3 DIMMs (2 GB, 4 GB, or 8 GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 gen2 (full height) and 4 x PCIe x8 gen2 (full height) PCI slots, and Eight SATA or SAS drives with optional hardware RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10).
* The Altix XE1200 cluster
* The Altix XE1300 cluster

All Altix XE systems support Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Microsoft Windows. VMware support was added across the Altix XE product line.

== Altix ICE ==

The Altix ICE blade platform is an Intel Xeon-based system featuring diskless compute blades and a Hierarchical Management Framework (HMF) for scalability, performance, and resiliency. While the earlier Itanium-based Altix systems run a single-system image (SSI) Linux kernel on 1024 processors or more using a standard SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) distribution, the Altix ICE&#x27;s clustering capabilities use standard SLES or Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions and scale to over 51,200 cores on NASA&#x27;s Pleiades supercomputer.

The Altix ICE 8200LX blade enclosure features two 4x DDR IB switch blade and one high-performing plane, and the Altix ICE 8200EX features four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high-performing planes. Both configurations support either hypercube or fat tree topology, and 16 compute blades within an IRU.

The IP-83 and IP-85 compute blades support Intel Xeon 5200 or 5400 Series processors, and the IP-95 compute blade support Intel Xeon 5500 Series processors.

In November 2011 the ICE 8400 is based on either Intel Xeon 5500 or 5600 processors or the AMD Opteron 6100 series processors.

, these use the Xeon Phi coprocessors.

==Altix UV==
The Altix UV supercomputer architecture was announced in November 2009. Codenamed Ultraviolet during development, the Altix UV combines a development of the NUMAlink interconnect used in the Altix 4000 (NUMAlink 5) with quad-, six- or eight-core &quot;Nehalem-EX&quot; Intel Xeon 7500 processors. Altix UV systems run either SuSE Linux Enterprise Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and scale from 32 to 2,048 cores with support for up to 16 terabytes (TB) of shared memory in a single system image.

In 2010 and 2011, SGI retired the Altix name for new servers produced by the company. Altix UV and Altix ICE have been shortened to &quot;SGI UV&quot; and &quot;SGI ICE,&quot; while the Altix XE line is named &quot;Rackable.&quot;

<doc id="1129625" wikidata="Q5402192" url="?curid=1129625" title="Margaret Keane">
<text>Margaret D. H. Keane (born Margaret Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927 – June 26, 2022) was an American artist known for her paintings of subjects with big eyes. She mainly painted women, children, or animals in oil or mixed media. The work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates, and cups. It has been critically acclaimed but also criticized as formulaic and clichéd. The artwork was originally attributed to Keane&#x27;s then-husband, Walter Keane. Soon after their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret claimed credit, which was established after a courtroom &quot;paint-off&quot; in Hawaii, in which Walter refused to participate.

A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane&#x27;s work followed the release of Tim Burton&#x27;s 2014 biopic &quot;Big Eyes&quot;. She maintained a gallery in San Francisco which boasts &quot;the largest collection of Margaret Keane&#x27;s art in the entire world.&quot; In light of the great gulf between her work&#x27;s popularity and its critical lampooning, she was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Wayne Newton of the art world.&quot;

==Early life==
Margaret Doris Hawkins was born elder of the two children of David Hawkins and Jessie (McBurnett) Hawkins on September 15, 1927, in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, one eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly, she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them. She and her brother David studied in public schools. Keane started drawing as a child and, at age 10, she took classes at the Watkins Institute in Nashville. When she was 10 years old, Keane painted her first oil portrait of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, and gave the painting to her grandmother.

At age 18, she attended the Traphagen School of Design in New York City for a year. She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits. Early on, Margaret began experimenting in kitsch. She worked in both acrylic and oil-based paints, with the subject of her artwork limited to women, children, and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).

==Career==
===Career with Walter Keane===
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. At the height of his popularity, Walter said he saw her sitting alone at a well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes. At the time Walter was also married and working as a real estate salesman, while painting on the side. However, he later told reporters that he had given up his &quot;highly successful real estate career&quot; in 1947. Margaret found him &quot;suave, gregarious and charming.&quot; The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.

Margaret said that he began selling her characteristic &quot;big eyes&quot; paintings immediately but, unknown to her, claimed it was his own work. A principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a jazz club in San Francisco. When she discovered his deception, she remained silent. She later explained her behavior: &quot;I was afraid of him because he [threatened] to have me done in if I said anything.&quot; Margaret publicly acknowledged him as the artist, later claiming it was &quot;tortuous&quot; for her. She rationalized the situation on the ground that &quot;[a]t least they were being shown.&quot;

In 1957, Walter began exhibiting the &quot;big eyes&quot; paintings as his own. In February, the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito. He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claimed to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer, Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Park Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another in a small East Side gallery for the same month. Walter began developing a myth about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began to promote &quot;The Painting Keanes.&quot; 

A large painting commissioned for the 1964–65 World&#x27;s Fair in New York had a procession of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground, where they lined up on a staircase. The art critic of The New York Times, John Canaday, described Keane as a painter celebrated &quot;for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane.&quot; Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair.

Pop artist Andy Warhol praised Keane&#x27;s work, telling &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1965, &quot;I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn&#x27;t like it.&quot;

===Career after Walter Keane===
In 1970, Margaret Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Margaret Keane revealed the truth, a &quot;paint-off&quot; between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up. In 1986, she sued both Walter and &quot;USA Today&quot; in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict, Margaret Keane said &quot;I really feel that justice has triumphed. It&#x27;s been worth it, even if I don&#x27;t see any of that four million dollars.&quot; A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damages award. Keane said she didn&#x27;t care about the money, and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.

The artworks Margaret Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, she moved to Hawaii and became a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis, and transcendental meditation, and her work took on a happier, brighter style. &quot;The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul,&quot; Keane explained. Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having &quot;tears of joy&quot; or &quot;tears of happiness.&quot; She described her subjects thus: &quot;These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God&#x27;s will is done.&quot;

Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood, and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits. In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector who would later direct the 2014 biographical film &quot;Big Eyes&quot; about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie. Keane&#x27;s art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation. Keane&#x27;s big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;.

In 2018, Keane received a lifetime achievement award at the LA Art Show.

==Style==
Keane&#x27;s paintings are recognizable due to the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects. Keane said she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature &quot;Keane eyes&quot; when she started painting portraits of children. &quot;Children do have big eyes. When I&#x27;m doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger,&quot; Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more. Keane attributed Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s work as a major influence on the way she painted women from 1959 on. Other artists who influenced her in terms of color, dimension, and composition include Vincent van Gogh, Gustav Klimt, and Pablo Picasso. Despite her claims to fine art, she was never a critical success; instead she remained &quot;known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of ironic style decades later.&quot;

==Personal life==
Keane&#x27;s first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich, with whom she had a daughter. In 1955, she married Walter Keane. She left Walter in 1964, divorcing him a year later, and then relocating from San Francisco to Hawaii.

In Hawaii, Keane became a devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, which she remained throughout her life. She credited her faith and reading the Bible for giving the courage to speak the truth about her art.

While still in Hawaii, Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970. She credited McGuire with helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter. Keane lived in Hawaii for more than 25 years before returning to California in 1991. She resided in Napa County, California, with her daughter Jane and son-in-law Don Swigert.

In 2017, at the age of 90, Keane began hospice care while still living in her home. The additional care that she received through hospice allowed her to recover enough &quot;to paint more and relax&quot;. She died from heart failure at her home in Napa, California, on June 26, 2022, at the age of 94.

==Media portrayals==
* In the 1965 comedy film &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot;, Stanley Ford&#x27;s town house, after being overhauled by his new wife, contains six paintings and drawings in the style of Keane.
* The 1988 song &quot;Velvet Elvis&quot;, by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, alludes to Keane&#x27;s paintings in the line &quot;Don&#x27;t need no soap on a rope, no pictures of Mexican kids with those really big eyes, or dogs playing poker&quot;.
* The 1998 cartoon series &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, created by animator Craig McCracken, features leads with abnormally large eyes inspired by Keane&#x27;s art. The series also features an elementary school teacher named &quot;Ms. Keane&quot;.
* In 1999, Matthew Sweet&#x27;s album &quot;In Reverse&quot; featured one of Keane&#x27;s oil paintings on its cover.
* In 2004 her painting of a child holding poodles can be seen in the episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot; titled &quot;Foe: Pa&quot;
* The 2014 biographical film, &quot;Big Eyes&quot;, focuses on Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz. The film was directed by Tim Burton. Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams&#x27; and Waltz&#x27;s characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.

<text>Gremlin Graphics Software Limited, later Gremlin Interactive Limited and ultimately Infogrames Studios Limited, was a British software house based in Sheffield, working mostly in the home computer market. Like many software houses established in the 1980s, their primary market was the 8-bit range of computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Commodore 16 and Commodore 64. The company was acquired by French video game publisher Infogrames in 1999 and was renamed Infogrames Studios in 2000. Infogrames Studios closed down in 2003.

== History ==

The company, originally a computer store called Just Micro, was established as a software house in 1984 with the name Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd by Ian Stewart and Kevin Norburn with US Gold&#x27;s Geoff Brown owning 75% of the company until mid-1989. Gremlin&#x27;s early success was based on games such as &quot;&quot; for the ZX Spectrum and &quot;Thing on a Spring&quot; for the Commodore 64. 

In 1994, it was renamed as Gremlin Interactive, now concentrating on the 16-bit, PC and console market. Gremlin enjoyed major success with the &quot;Zool&quot; and &quot;Premier Manager&quot; series in the early 1990s, and then with &quot;Actua Soccer&quot;, the first football game in full 3D; other successful games included the &quot;Lotus&quot; racing series; a futuristic racing game, &quot;Motorhead&quot;; a stunt car racing game, &quot;Fatal Racing&quot; (1995); and the 1998 flight simulator &quot;Hardwar&quot;. Following EA&#x27;s success with the EA Sports brand, Gremlin also released their own sports videogame series, adding Golf, Tennis and Ice Hockey to their &quot;Actua Sports&quot; series. During this time, they used a &quot;motif&quot; from the Siegfried Funeral March from &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; as introductory music.

The company was floated on the stock market to raise funds.

In 1997, Gremlin acquired Imagitec Design and DMA Design (creators of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Lemmings&quot;). In 1999, they themselves were bought by Infogrames for around £24 million and renamed &quot;Infogrames Sheffield House&quot;. Infogrames closed the studio in 2003. The building they latterly occupied near Devonshire Green has since been demolished when Infogrames Sheffield House was supposed to be renamed &quot;Atari Sheffield House&quot;. In October 2003, Zoo Digital, the successor company to Gremlin, purchased the company&#x27;s assets from the now-named Atari.

Following the administration of Zoo Digital (later renamed Zushi Games), Gremlin Interactive&#x27;s catalogue and name were bought up by Ian Stewart&#x27;s new company Urbanscan.

The Gremlin trademarks (including the g Gremlin logo) are now owned by Warner Bros Entertainment.

<text>John David Souther (November 2, 1945 – September 17, 2024) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He was &quot;a principal architect of the Southern California sound and a major influence on a generation of songwriters&quot;. Souther wrote and co-wrote songs recorded by Linda Ronstadt and some of the Eagles biggest hits, including &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;Victim of Love&quot;, &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;. &quot;How Long&quot;, which appeared on the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, came from Souther&#x27;s first solo album. He recorded two hit songs in his solo career: &quot;You&#x27;re Only Lonely&quot; (1979) and &quot;Her Town Too&quot; (1981), a duet with James Taylor. He had a brief acting career and appeared on TV and in movies. He played with the Eagles on their 2008 farewell tour. 

== Early life and career ==
Souther was born on November 2, 1945, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of John Souther and Loty (nee Finley), and was raised in Amarillo, Texas. His father sang in a jazz band and later ran a store selling records and musical instruments. His grandmother was an opera singer, and the first song he learned as a child was Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;. He learned to play the violin, and later clarinet, saxophone and guitar. He attended Amarillo college but dropped out to play drums with his first band, The Cinders. 

His first recordings were made with The Cinders at the nearby Norman Petty Studios in Clovis, New Mexico. The band&#x27;s first 45 rpm record was released on the RIC label in 1965. The following year, Norman Petty successfully shopped their recordings to Warner Bros. Records for a second single release under the name John David and The Cinders.

After living in New York and Florida, Souther moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and met musician and songwriter Glenn Frey. They became room-mates and musical collaborators and briefly performed as a folk duo using the name Longbranch Pennywhistle. They released an album in 1970 on Jimmy Bowen&#x27;s Amos Records. Souther helped the Eagles to form as a backing band for Linda Ronstadt and when they branched out on their own, he played with them at the Troubadour on LA&#x27;s Sunset Strip. 

Souther declined an offer to join The Eagles and instead signed to David Geffen&#x27;s Asylum label and recorded a debut solo studio album under his own name. In 1972 he formed the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band with Chris Hillman of The Byrds and Richie Furay of Buffalo Springfield. The group released two albums which failed to sell and the band split up. Souther wrote the song &quot;Run Like a Thief&quot; which appeared on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s 1975 album, &quot;Home Plate&quot;.

1976 saw the release of Souther&#x27;s second solo LP &quot;Black Rose&quot;, produced by Peter Asher and considered by many to be his finest work. It featured a duet with Ronstadt, &quot;If You Have Crying Eyes&quot;. Souther contributed as a singer to works written by other artists, including backing vocals with Don Henley; on &quot;The Light Is On&quot; for Christopher Cross on his debut album; on the songs &quot;False Faces&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot; on Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s 1976 LP &quot;Nether Lands&quot;; and, with Fogelberg, as the Hot Damn Brothers on Fogelberg&#x27;s 1975 LP &quot;Captured Angel&quot;.

Souther co-wrote several songs for the Eagles including &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;James Dean&quot;, &quot;New Kid In Town&quot;, and &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot;. The Eagles recording &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, written by Souther, Bob Seger, Frey, and Henley, was released in 1979 and became the band&#x27;s final chart-topping song on the Billboard Hot 100. Souther scored his biggest solo hit with the 1979 song &quot;You&#x27;re Only Lonely&quot; from the album of the same name, which reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and held the number 1 spot on the Adult Contemporary chart for five consecutive weeks. He was an accomplished performer, and Frey commented that the only reason he was not a bigger solo star was that &quot;he gave the Eagles and Linda Ronstadt most of his best songs&quot;. 

Souther dated Ronstadt in the 1970s and co-produced her &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Now&quot; album. He also wrote songs for several of her multi-platinum albums, including &quot;Faithless Love&quot; from &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot; and &quot;White Rhythm and Blues&quot; on &quot;Living in the USA&quot;. He recorded other duets with Ronstadt, including &quot;Prisoner in Disguise&quot;, &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, and &quot;Hearts Against the Wind&quot;, which was featured in the 1980 film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. He collaborated with his friend James Taylor on &quot;Her Town Too&quot; from Taylor&#x27;s platinum-certified &quot;Dad Loves His Work&quot; album; it reached number 11 on the Hot 100 and number 5 on the AC chart in 1981.

In 1987 he contributed to, performed on, and arranged the vocals for the &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night&quot; concert and video. That same year he collaborated with Clannad, providing guest vocals for their album &quot;Sirius&quot;. He sang the Platters&#x27; &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Always&quot;, and wrote the theme song to the 1989–92 sitcom &quot;Anything But Love&quot;. He wrote the song &quot;Wishing on Another Lucky Star&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack of the 1988 movie &quot;Permanent Record&quot;. He co-wrote Don Henley&#x27;s 1989 hit song &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; and &quot;Doin&#x27; Time for Bein&#x27; Young&quot;, a song performed by James Intveld for the soundtrack of the 1990 Johnny Depp movie &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;.

At the end of the 1980s, Souther retired from music for more than twenty years years &quot;to build a great house and have a life&quot;. He returned to recording in 2008 and in October released an album recorded with a jazz band, &quot;If the World Was You&quot;, his first new studio release in nearly 25 years. He said he had retired from the music industry because it was making him crazy, but &quot;it turns out I was crazy anyway, so I thought I might as well start making records again.&quot; He joined the Eagles on their farewell tour in 2008; the band opened the show each night with his 1972 song &quot;How Long&quot;, from the &quot;Long Road Out Of Eden&quot; album. 

In the fall of 2009, Souther released a follow-up live album, &quot;Rain − Live at the Belcourt Theatre&quot;, featuring a blend of old and new material. On May 31, 2011, he released &quot;Natural History,&quot; featuring new versions of his songs recorded by other artists. On October 9, 2012, he released &quot;Midnight in Tokyo,&quot; a live EP. On June 14, 2013, Souther was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He was described as &quot;a principal architect of the Southern California sound and a major influence on a generation of songwriters.&quot;

=== Acting career ===
In 1989, Souther played the character of John Dunaway in the third season of the television drama &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. In 1990 he played Ted in the film &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;. He appeared in the audiobook of Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s &quot;A Salty Piece of Land&quot;. Souther played Jesse James in the television movie &quot;Purgatory&quot; in 1999 and Jeffrey Pommeroy in &quot;My Girl 2&quot;. In 2012, he appeared in the mystery thriller &quot;Deadline&quot;. He had a recurring role in the first season of the country music drama series &quot;Nashville&quot;, which premiered in October 2012. He reprised his role in a 2017 episode of the fifth season.

== Personal life and death ==
Souther married Alexandra Sliwin, a member of the group Honey Ltd., in March 1969; they divorced in 1972. He dated Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Nicks in the 1970s. He briefly dated Judee Sill and was the inspiration for her song &quot;Jesus Was a Cross Maker&quot;.

In December 2002, Souther moved from the Hollywood Hills to Nashville, Tennessee. In 2004, he married Sarah Nicholson from Bansha, Ireland; they divorced in 2010.

JD Souther died at his home in Sandia Park, New Mexico, on September 17, 2024, at the age of 78. He was due to begin a tour in less than a week with songwriter Karla Bonoff.

<text>Merv Griffin Enterprises was an American television production company founded by Merv Griffin, in operation from March 7, 1963, to June 4, 1994.

==History==

The company was first established as Milbarn Productions on March 7, 1963, and later as Merv Griffin Productions on March 5, 1964. Griffin&#x27;s first production under the Milbarn name was &quot;Word for Word&quot;. Griffin&#x27;s second game show was &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as Griffin&#x27;s first production under the MGP name on March 30, 1964. In May 1965, his talk show &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; returned to television. Griffin also created the game show &quot;Shopper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; on January 6, 1975, after &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was canceled on January 3, 1975. Griffin revived &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as &quot;The All-New Jeopardy!&quot; on October 2, 1978, though it was proven to be unsuccessful. Merv Griffin Productions also owned the post-production studio Trans-American Video (TAV) that was founded on June 29, 1981.

In 1982, the company joined forces with King World (now CBS Media Ventures) to syndicate a nightly version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. The company also had the rights to syndicate &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. KW also distributed the first two pilots of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 1983 and January 9, 1984. In 1984, Griffin expanded his company as Merv Griffin Enterprises and during the same year, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; also returned to television on September 10. On May 5, 1986, Griffin sold the company to The Coca-Cola Company (then-owner of Columbia Pictures Industries) for $250 million during his semi-retirement. TAV, however, was not included in the deal. The company later became part of Columbia Pictures Entertainment on December 21, 1987, and was sold to Sony Corporation along with CPE&#x27;s other companies on November 8, 1989.

Merv Griffin Enterprises was folded into Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television) on June 4, 1994. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; were taken over by CTT starting in September of that year, while Griffin remained executive producer for both game shows until 2000. Griffin later founded Merv Griffin Entertainment on May 13, 1996.
==Employees==
One of the most prolific employees was Don Pardo. The others were Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, Jack Clark, John Harlan, M. G. Kelly, and Johnny Gilbert, who were also announcers on Griffin shows. Most of the above announcers also worked for Bob Stewart Productions. Future executive producer of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Michael Davies, worked as a development associate at the company during the early 1990s. Another employee was director Dick Carson, who also served as director for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for his brother Johnny Carson.

<doc id="1129640" wikidata="Q504039" url="?curid=1129640" title="Tanacharison">
<text>Tanacharison (; c. 1700 – 4 October 1754), also called Tanaghrisson (), was a Native American leader who played a pivotal role in the beginning of the French and Indian War. He was known to European-Americans as the Half-King, a title also used to describe several other historically important Native American leaders. His name has been spelled in a variety of ways.

==Early life==
Little is known of Tanacharison&#x27;s early life. He was born into the Catawba tribe whose lands and villages were along what now called the Catawba River in South Carolina (Not Buffalo, NY).

==Becoming a leader==
Tanacharison first appears in historical records in 1747, living in Logstown (near present Ambridge, Pennsylvania), a multi-ethnic village about 20 miles (30 kilometers) downstream from the forks of the Ohio River. Those Iroquois who had migrated to the Ohio Country were generally known as &#x27;Mingos,&#x27; and Tanacharison emerged as a Mingo leader at this time. He also represented the Six Nations at the 1752 Treaty of Logstown, where he was referred to as &quot;Thonariss, called by the English the half King&quot;. At this treaty, he spoke on behalf of the Six Nations&#x27; Grand Council, but also made clear that the council&#x27;s ratification was required, in accordance with the Iroquois system of government.

According to the traditional interpretation, the Grand Council had named Tanacharison as leader or &quot;half-king&quot; (a sort of viceroy) to conduct diplomacy with other tribes, and to act as spokesman to the British on their behalf. However, some modern historians have doubted this interpretation, asserting that Tanacharison was merely a village leader, whose actual authority extended no further than his own village. In this view, the title &quot;half king&quot; was probably a British invention, and his &quot;subsequent lofty historical role as a Six Nations &#x27;regent&#x27; or &#x27;viceroy&#x27; in the Ohio Country was the product of later generations of scholars.&quot;

==French and Indian War==
In 1753, the French began the military occupation of the Ohio Country, driving out British traders and constructing a series of forts. British colonies, however, also claimed the Ohio Country. Robert Dinwiddie, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, sent a young George Washington to travel to the French outposts and demand that the French vacate the Ohio Country. On his journey, Washington&#x27;s party stopped at Logstown to ask Tanacharison to accompany them as a guide and as a &quot;spokesman&quot; for the Ohio Indians. Tanacharison agreed to return the symbolic wampum he had received from French captain Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire. Joncaire&#x27;s first reaction, on learning of this double cross, was to mutter of Tanacharison, &quot;He is more English than the English.&quot; But Joncaire masked his anger and insisted that Tanacharison join him in a series of toasts. By the time the keg was empty, Tanacharison was too drunk to hand back the wampum. 

Tanacharison traveled with Washington to meet with Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, the French commander of Fort Le Boeuf in what is now Waterford, Pennsylvania. There he tried to return the wampum to Saint-Pierre, &quot;who evaded taking it, &amp; made many fair Promises of Love &amp; Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace &amp; trade amicably with them; as a Proof of which, he wou’d send some Goods immediately down to the Logstown for them.&quot; The French refused to vacate, however, and to Washington&#x27;s great consternation, they tried to court Tanacharison as an ally. Although fond of their brandy, he remained a strong francophobe.

Tanacharison had requested that the British construct a &quot;strong house&quot; at the Forks of the Ohio and early in 1754 he placed the first log of an Ohio Company stockade there, railing against the French when they captured it. He was camped at Half King&#x27;s Rock on May 27, 1754 when he learned of a nearby French encampment and sent word urging an attack to Washington at the Great Meadows, about five miles (8 km) east of Chestnut Ridge in what is now Fayette County, Pennsylvania (near Uniontown). Washington immediately ordered 40 men to join Tanacharison and at sunset followed with a second group, seven of whom got lost in heavy rain that night. It was dawn on May 28 before Washington reached the Half King&#x27;s Rock.

After a hurried war council, the English and Tanacharison&#x27;s eight or nine warriors set off to surround and attack the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, who quickly surrendered. The French commander, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, was among the wounded. In one of several disputed and contradictory accounts, it is claimed that Tancharison uttered the French words, &quot;Tu n&#x27;es pas encore mort, mon père!&quot; (Thou art not yet dead, my father), then sank his tomahawk in Jumonville&#x27;s skull, washed his hands with the brains, &quot;and scalped him,&quot; but not before eating a portion of Jumonville&#x27;s brain. Only one of the wounded French soldiers was not killed and scalped among a total of ten dead, 21 captured, and one missing, a man named Monceau who had wandered off to relieve himself that morning.

Monceau witnessed the French surrender before walking barefoot to the Monongahela River and paddling down it to report to Contrecoeur, commanding at Fort Duquesne. Tanacharison sent a messenger to Contrecoeur the following day with news that the British had shot Jumonville and, but for the Indians, would have killed all the French. A third (and more accurate) account of the Jumonville Glen encounter was told to Jumonville&#x27;s half-brother, Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers, by a deserter at the mouth of Redstone Creek during his expedition to avenge his brother&#x27;s murder.

Washington was without Indian allies on July 3, 1754 at the battle of Fort Necessity, his hastily erected stockade at the Great Meadows. Tanacharison scornfully called the fort &quot;that little thing upon the meadow&quot; and complained that Washington would not listen to advice, and that Washington treated the Indians like slaves. He and another Seneca leader, Queen Aliquippa, had taken their people to Wills Creek. Outnumbered and with supplies running low, Washington surrendered the fort, later blaming Captains George Croghan and Andrew Montour for &quot;involving the country in great calamity&quot;.

==Relationship with Croghan==
Tanacharison had a long relationship with George Croghan, a fur trader, interpreter, and diplomat among the Native Americans who had been appointed a member of the Iroquois&#x27; Onondaga Council. Tanacharison had been &quot;one of the sachems who had confirmed Croghan in his land grant of 1749,&quot; 200,000 acres minus about two square miles at the Forks of the Ohio for a British fort. Thomas Penn and Pennsylvania planned to build a stone fort, but Croghan realized that his deeds would be invalid if in Pennsylvania, and had Andrew Montour testify before the Assembly in 1751 that the Indians did not want the fort and that it had all been Croghan&#x27;s idea, scuttling the project.

In 1752, Croghan was on the Indian council that granted Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company permission to build the fort. Tanacharison&#x27;s introduction of Croghan to the Virginia commissioners suggests that Croghan organized and led the 1748 Ohio Indian Confederation, which appointed Croghan as the colony&#x27;s representative in negotiations, and that Pennsylvania recognized as independent of the Six Nations:Brethren, it is a great while since our brother, the Buck (meaning Mr. George Croghan) has been doing business between us, &amp; our brother of Pennsylvania, but we understand he does not intend to do any more, so I now inform you that he is approv&#x27;d of by our Council at Onondago, for we sent to them to let them know how he has helped us in our councils here and to let you &amp; him know that he is one of our people and shall help us still &amp; be one of our council, I deliver him this string of wampum.

The Ohio Company fort was surrendered to the French by Croghan&#x27;s half-brother, Edward Ward, and commanded by his business partner, William Trent. The role of Croghan (who was Pittsburgh&#x27;s president judge for Virginia and chairman of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Committee of Safety after Pontiac&#x27;s War) remains uncertain, since Croghan was later declared a traitor by General Edward Hand and exiled from the frontier.

==Last days==
Shortly after the battle of Jumonville Glen, Tanacharison moved his people and the old queen Aliquippa east to Croghan&#x27;s Aughwick plantation in the Aughwick Valley near present Shirleysburg, Pennsylvania. There Tanacharison became seriously ill and was taken to the farm of John Harris at Paxtang, Pennsylvania (near present-day Harrisburg, Pennsylvania). He would take no active part in the remainder of the war and died of pneumonia on October 4, 1754. Aliquippa died on December 23, 1754.

<doc id="1129641" wikidata="Q10871684" url="?curid=1129641" title="Electronic health record">
<text>An electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format. These records can be shared across different health care settings. Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.

For several decades, electronic health records (EHRs) have been touted as key to increasing of quality care. Electronic health records are used for other reasons than charting for patients; today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs. EHR combines all patients demographics into a large pool, and uses this information to assist with the creation of &quot;new treatments or innovation in healthcare delivery&quot; which overall improves the goals in healthcare. Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system&#x27;s health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients. EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients.

EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time. It eliminates the need to track down a patient&#x27;s previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is up-to-date, accurate and legible. It also allows open communication between the patient and the provider, while providing &quot;privacy and security.&quot; It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date and decreases risk of lost paperwork and is cost efficient. Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient. Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs.

==Terminology==
The terms EHR, electronic patient record (EPR) and electronic medical record (EMR) have often been used interchangeably, but &quot;subtle&quot; differences exist. The electronic health record (EHR) is a more longitudinal collection of the electronic health information of individual patients or populations. The EMR, in contrast, is the patient record created by providers for specific encounters in hospitals and ambulatory environments and can serve as a data source for an EHR. 

EMRs are essentially digital versions of the paper charts used in a clinician’s office, typically functioning as an internal system within a practice. An EMR includes the medical and treatment history of patients treated by that specific practice. 

In contrast, a personal health record (PHR) is an electronic application for recording personal medical data that the individual patient controls and may make available to health providers.

==Comparison with paper-based records==
While there is still a considerable amount of debate around the superiority of electronic health records over paper records, the research literature paints a more realistic picture of the benefits and downsides.

The increased transparency, portability, and accessibility acquired by the adoption of electronic medical records may increase the ease with which they can be accessed by healthcare professionals, but also can increase the amount of stolen information by unauthorized persons or unscrupulous users versus paper medical records, as acknowledged by the increased security requirements for electronic medical records included in the Health Information and Accessibility Act and by large-scale breaches in confidential records reported by EMR users. Concerns about security contribute to the resistance shown to their adoption.

Handwritten paper medical records may be poorly legible, which can contribute to medical errors. Pre-printed forms, standardization of abbreviations and standards for penmanship were encouraged to improve the reliability of paper medical records. An example of possible medical errors is the administration of medication. Medication is an intervention that can turn a person&#x27;s status from stable to unstable very quickly. With paper documentation it is very easy to not properly document the administration of medication, the time given, or errors such as giving the &quot;wrong drug, dose, form, or not checking for allergies&quot; and could affect the patient negatively. It has been reported that these errors have been reduced by &quot;55-83%&quot; because records are now online and require certain steps to avoid these errors.

Electronic records may help with the standardization of forms, terminology, and data input. Digitization of forms facilitates the collection of data for epidemiology and clinical studies. However, standardization may create challenges for local practice. Overall, those with EMRs that have automated notes and records, order entry, and clinical decision support had fewer complications, lower mortality rates, and lower costs.

EMRs can be continuously updated (within certain legal limitations: see below). If the ability to exchange records between different EMR systems were perfected (&quot;interoperability&quot;), it would facilitate the coordination of health care delivery in nonaffiliated health care facilities. In addition, data from an electronic system can be used anonymously for statistical reporting in matters such as quality improvement, resource management, and public health communicable disease surveillance. However, it is difficult to remove data from its context.

== Patient access to electronic health records ==
Providing patients with information is central to patient-centered health care and this has been shown to have some positive effects on health outcomes. Providing patients with access to their health records including medical histories and test results via an electronic health record is a legal right in some parts of the world. 

There is some evidence that patient access may help outcomes. Sharing their electronic health records with people who have type 2 diabetes may help these people to reduce their blood sugar levels. It is a way of helping people understand their own health condition and involving them actively in its management.

Challenges with sharing the electronic health record with patients includes a risk of increased confusion or anxiety if a person does not understand or cannot contextualize the testing results. In addition, many EHRs are not designed for people of all educational levels and do not consider the needs of those with a lower level of education or those who are not fluent in the language. Accessing the EHR requires a level of proficiency with electronic devices which adds in a disparity for those without access or for those who have a mental or physical illness that restricts their access to the electronic system.

== Use in research and development ==

Electronic medical records could also be studied to quantify disease burdens – such as the number of deaths from antimicrobial resistance – or help identify causes of, factors of, links between and contributors to diseases, especially when combined with genome-wide association studies.

This may enable increased flexibility, improved disease surveillance, better medical product safety surveillance, better public health monitoring (such as for evaluation of health policy effectiveness), increased quality of care (via guidelines and improved medical history sharing), and novel life-saving treatments.

=== Issues ===
Privacy: For such purposes, electronic medical records could potentially be made available in securely anonymized or pseudonymized forms to ensure patients&#x27; privacy is maintained&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.0911686107&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; even if data breaches occur. There are concerns about the efficacy of some currently applied pseudonymization and data protection techniques, including the applied encryption.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011099&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation burden: While such records could enable avoiding duplication of work via records-sharing, documentation burdens for medical facility personnel can be a further issue with EHRs. This burden could be reduced via voice recognition, optical character recognition, other technologies, involvement of physicians in changes to software, and other means&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1370/afm.2860&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which could possibly reduce the documentation burden to below paper-based records documentation and low-level documentation.

===Applications using software===
Theoretically, free software such as GNU Health and other open source health software could be used or modified for various purposes that use electronic medical records i.a. via securely sharing anonymized patient treatments, medical history and individual outcomes (including by common primary care physicians).
* Decision-support: Electronic health records could also support clinical decision support systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1002/widm.1350&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Personalized medicine: They could be used among other biodata for digital twins (also called health avatars) for personalized medicine.
* mHealth integration: They could be coupled with mHealth mobile applications and wearable technology.
* Screening: Artificial intelligence systems could use this data among other integrated data to screen for potential diseases via multimodal learning.
* Syndromic surveillance: Real-time analysis and data mining of the records could be used, along with other data, in syndromic surveillance to rapidly identify common exposures among patients suspected of being part of an outbreak, for epidemic forecasting, and for early outbreak detection, especially in identified potential pandemic pathogen (PPP) hotspot regions and potentially as a means for pandemic prevention.
* Vaccination deployment: Interoperable, collaboratively developed, standardization-based health records systems could increase the speed of vaccination campaigns as well as reduce their costs or workloads. According to Dr. Bob Kocher, as of 2021 there are &quot;1,000 different electronic health record systems in the U.S., and almost every hospital and clinic has a slightly different system tailored to its own needs&quot; which caused difficulties and delays during COVID-19 vaccinations, with similar problems being reported in other countries.
* Medical outcomes data: Such records could also be used for matching patients to clinical trials with software, generally reduce the burden on users to partake in research and make previously siloed primary care data more valuable to society at larger or other patients.

==Emergency medical services==
Ambulance services in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom have introduced the use of EMR systems. EMS Encounters in the United States are recorded using various platforms and vendors in compliance with the NEMSIS (National EMS Information System) standard. The benefits of electronic records in ambulances include: patient data sharing, injury/illness prevention, better training for paramedics, review of clinical standards, better research options for pre-hospital care and design of future treatment options, data based outcome improvement, and clinical decision support.

==Technical features==
* Digital formatting enables information to be used and shared over secure networks
* Track care (e.g. prescriptions) and outcomes (e.g. blood pressure)
* Trigger warnings and reminders
* Send and receive orders, reports, and results
* Decrease billing processing time and create more accurate billing system

Health Information Exchange
* Technical and social framework that enables information to move electronically between organizations

Using an EMR to read and write a patient&#x27;s record is not only possible through a workstation but, depending on the type of system and health care settings, may also be possible through mobile devices that are handwriting capable, such as tablets and smartphones. Electronic Medical Records may include access to Personal Health Records (PHR) which makes individual notes from an EMR readily visible and accessible for consumers.

Some EMR systems automatically monitor clinical events, by analyzing patient data from an electronic health record to predict, detect and potentially prevent adverse events. This can include discharge/transfer orders, pharmacy orders, radiology results, laboratory results and any other data from ancillary services or provider notes. This type of event monitoring has been implemented using the Louisiana Public health information exchange linking statewide public health with electronic medical records. This system alerted medical providers when a patient with HIV/AIDS had not received care in over twelve months. This system greatly reduced the number of missed critical opportunities.

==Philosophical views==
Within a meta-narrative systematic review of research in the field, various different philosophical approaches to the EHR exist. The health information systems literature has seen the EHR as a container holding information about the patient, and a tool for aggregating clinical data for secondary uses (billing, audit, etc.). However, other research traditions see the EHR as a contextualised artifact within a socio-technical system. For example, actor-network theory would see the EHR as an actant in a network, and research in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) sees the EHR as a tool supporting particular work.

Several possible advantages to EHRs over paper records have been proposed, but there is debate about the degree to which these are achieved in practice.

==Implementation==

===Quality===
Several studies call into question whether EHRs improve the quality of care. One 2011 study in diabetes care, published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, found evidence that practices with EHR provided better quality care.

EMRs may eventually help improve care coordination. An article in a trade journal suggests that since anyone using an EMR can view the patient&#x27;s full chart, it cuts down on guessing histories, seeing multiple specialists, smooths transitions between care settings, and may allow better care in emergency situations. EHRs may also improve prevention by providing doctors and patients better access to test results, identifying missing patient information, and offering evidence-based recommendations for preventive services.

===Costs===
The steep price and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment has a significant influence on EHR adoption. In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information, surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EHR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the Rand Corporation&#x27;s estimates of savings. &quot;Office-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product—and may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that might offset the EHR&#x27;s cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example, the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians.&quot; One CEO of an EHR company has argued if a physician performs tests in the office, it might reduce his or her income.

Doubts have been raised about cost saving from EHRs by researchers at Harvard University, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and others.

In 2022 the chief executive of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Foundation Trust, one of the biggest NHS organisations, said that the £450 million cost over 15 years to install the Epic Systems electronic patient record across its six hospitals, which will reduce more than 100 different IT systems down to just a handful, was &quot;chicken feed&quot; when compared to the NHS&#x27;s overall budget.

=== Time ===
The implementation of EMR can potentially decrease identification time of patients upon hospital admission. A research from the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that since the adoption of EMR a relative decrease in time by 65% has been recorded (from 130 to 46 hours).

===Software quality and usability deficiencies===
The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a very large U.S. healthcare IT industry trade group, observed in 2009 that EHR adoption rates &quot;have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available.&quot; The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers. The U.S. military&#x27;s EHR, AHLTA, was reported to have significant usability issues. Furthermore, studies such as the one conducted in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, also showed that although the implementation of electronic medical records systems has been a great assistance to general practitioners there is still much room for revision in the overall framework and the amount of training provided. It was observed that the efforts to improve EHR usability should be placed in the context of physician-patient communication.

However, physicians are embracing mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets at a rapid pace. According to a 2012 survey by &quot;Physicians Practice&quot;, 62.6 percent of respondents (1,369 physicians, practice managers, and other healthcare providers) say they use mobile devices in the performance of their job. Mobile devices are increasingly able to sync up with electronic health record systems thus allowing physicians to access patient records from remote locations. Most devices are extensions of desk-top EHR systems, using a variety of software to communicate and access files remotely. The advantages of instant access to patient records at any time and any place are clear, but bring a host of security concerns. As mobile systems become more prevalent, practices will need comprehensive policies that govern security measures and patient privacy regulations.

Other advanced computational techniques have allowed EHRs to be evaluated at a much quicker rate. Natural language processing is increasingly used to search EMRs, especially through searching and analyzing notes and text that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care. One study found that several machine learning methods could be used to predict the rate of a patient&#x27;s mortality with moderate success, with the most successful approach including using a combination of a convolutional neural network and a heterogenous graph model.

=== Hardware and workflow considerations ===
When a health facility has documented their workflow and chosen their software solution they must then consider the hardware and supporting device infrastructure for the end users. Staff and patients will need to engage with various devices throughout a patient&#x27;s stay and charting workflow. Computers, laptops, all-in-one computers, tablets, mouse, keyboards and monitors are all hardware devices that may be utilized. Other considerations will include supporting work surfaces and equipment, wall desks or articulating arms for end users to work on. Another important factor is how all these devices will be physically secured and how they will be charged that staff can always utilize the devices for EHR charting when needed.

The success of eHealth interventions is largely dependent on the ability of the adopter to fully understand workflow and anticipate potential clinical processes prior to implementations. Failure to do so can create costly and time-consuming interruptions to service delivery.

===Unintended consequences===
Per empirical research in social informatics, information and communications technology (ICT) use can lead to both intended and unintended consequences.

A 2008 Sentinel Event Alert from the U.S. Joint Commission, the organization that accredits American hospitals to provide healthcare services, states, &#x27;As health information technology (HIT) and &#x27;converging technologies&#x27;—the interrelationship between medical devices and HIT—are increasingly adopted by health care organizations, users must be mindful of the safety risks and preventable adverse events that these implementations can create or perpetuate. Technology-related adverse events can be associated with all components of a comprehensive technology system and may involve errors of either commission or omission. These unintended adverse events typically stem from human-machine interfaces or organization/system design.&quot; The Joint Commission cites as an example the United States Pharmacopeia MEDMARX database where of 176,409 medication error records for 2006, approximately 25 percent (43,372) involved some aspect of computer technology as at least one cause of the error.

The British National Health Service (NHS) reports specific examples of potential and actual EHR-caused unintended consequences in its 2009 document on the management of clinical risk relating to the deployment and use of health software.

In a February 2010, an American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) memorandum noted that EHR unintended consequences include EHR-related medical errors from (1) errors of commission (EOC), (2) errors of omission or transmission (EOT), (3) errors in data analysis (EDA), and (4) incompatibility between multi-vendor software applications or systems (ISMA), examples were cited. The FDA also noted that the &quot;absence of mandatory reporting enforcement of H-IT safety issues limits the numbers of medical device reports (MDRs) and impedes a more comprehensive understanding of the actual problems and implications.&quot;

A 2010 Board Position Paper by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) contains recommendations on EHR-related patient safety, transparency, ethics education for purchasers and users, adoption of best practices, and re-examination of regulation of electronic health applications. Beyond concrete issues such as conflicts of interest and privacy concerns, questions have been raised about the ways in which the physician-patient relationship would be affected by an electronic intermediary.

During the implementation phase, cognitive workload for healthcare professionals may be significantly increased as they become familiar with a new system.

EHRs are almost invariably detrimental to physician productivity, whether the data is entered during the encounter or sometime thereafter. It is possible for an EHR to increase physician productivity by providing a fast and intuitive interface for viewing and understanding patient clinical data and minimizing the number of clinically irrelevant questions, but that is almost never the case. The other way to mitigate the detriment to physician productivity is to hire scribes to work alongside medical practitioners, which is almost never financially viable.

As a result, many have conducted studies like the one discussed in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association&quot;, &quot;The Extent And Importance of Unintended Consequences Related To Computerized Provider Order Entry,&quot; which seeks to understand the degree and significance of unplanned adverse consequences related to computerized physician order entry and understand how to interpret adverse events and understand the importance of its management for the overall success of computer physician order entry.

==Governance, privacy and legal issues==

===Privacy concerns===
In the United States, Great Britain, and Germany, the concept of a national centralized server model of healthcare data has been poorly received. Issues of privacy and security in such a model have been of concern.

In the European Union (EU), a new directly binding instrument, a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council, was passed in 2016 to go into effect in 2018 to protect the processing of personal data, including that for purposes of health care, the General Data Protection Regulation.

Threats to health care information can be categorized under three headings:
* Human threats, such as employees or hackers
* Natural and environmental threats, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and fires.
* Technology failures, such as a system crashing

These threats can either be internal, external, intentional and unintentional. Therefore, one will find health information systems professionals having these particular threats in mind when discussing ways to protect the health information of patients. It has been found that there is a lack of security awareness among health care professionals in countries such as Spain. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has developed a framework to mitigate the harm of these threats that is comprehensive but not so specific as to limit the options of healthcare professionals who may have access to different technology. With the increase of clinical notes being shared electronically as a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, an increase in sensitive terms used across the records of all patients, including minors, are increasingly shared amongst care teams, complicating efforts to maintain privacy.

Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was given Royal Assent in Canada on 13 April 2000 to establish rules on the use, disclosure and collection of personal information. The personal information includes both non-digital and electronic form. In 2002, PIPEDA extended to the health sector in Stage 2 of the law&#x27;s implementation. There are four provinces where this law does not apply because their privacy laws were considered similar to PIPEDA: Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom led to radical changes. NHS Digital and NHSX made changes, said to be only for the duration of the crisis, to the information sharing system GP Connect across England, meaning that patient records are shared across primary care. Only patients who have specifically opted out are excluded.

===Legal issues===

====Liability====
Legal liability in all aspects of healthcare was an increasing problem in the 1990s and 2000s. The surge in the per capita number of attorneys in the USA and changes in the tort system caused an increase in the cost of every aspect of healthcare, and healthcare technology was no exception.

Failure or damages caused during installation or utilization of an EHR system has been feared as a threat in lawsuits. Similarly, it&#x27;s important to recognize that the implementation of electronic health records carries with it significant legal risks.

This liability concern was of special concern for small EHR system makers. Some smaller companies may be forced to abandon markets based on the regional liability climate. Larger EHR providers (or government-sponsored providers of EHRs) are better able to withstand legal assaults.

While there is no argument that electronic documentation of patient visits and data brings improved patient care, there is increasing concern that such documentation could open physicians to an increased incidence of malpractice suits. Disabling physician alerts, selecting from dropdown menus, and the use of templates can encourage physicians to skip a complete review of past patient history and medications, and thus miss important data.

Another potential problem is electronic time stamps. Many physicians are unaware that EHR systems produce an electronic time stamp every time the patient record is updated. If a malpractice claim goes to court, through the process of discovery, the prosecution can request a detailed record of all entries made in a patient&#x27;s electronic record. Waiting to chart patient notes until the end of the day and making addendums to records well after the patient visit can be problematic, in that this practice could result in less than accurate patient data or indicate possible intent to illegally alter the patient&#x27;s record.

In some communities, hospitals attempt to standardize EHR systems by providing discounted versions of the hospital&#x27;s software to local healthcare providers. A challenge to this practice has been raised as being a violation of Stark rules that prohibit hospitals from preferentially assisting community healthcare providers. In 2006, however, exceptions to the Stark rule were enacted to allow hospitals to furnish software and training to community providers, mostly removing this legal obstacle.

====Legal interoperability====
In cross-border use cases of EHR implementations, the additional issue of legal interoperability arises. Different countries may have diverging legal requirements for the content or usage of electronic health records, which can require radical changes to the technical makeup of the EHR implementation in question. (especially when fundamental legal incompatibilities are involved) Exploring these issues is therefore often necessary when implementing cross-border EHR solutions.

==Contribution under UN administration and accredited organizations==
The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) administration intentionally does not contribute to an internationally standardized view of medical records nor to personal health records. However, WHO contributes to minimum requirements definition for developing countries.

The United Nations accredited standardization body International Organization for Standardization (ISO) however has settled thorough word for standards in the scope of the HL7 platform for health care informatics. Respective standards are available with ISO/HL7 10781:2009 Electronic Health Record-System Functional Model, Release 1.1 and subsequent set of detailing standards.

==Medical data breach==

The majority of the countries in Europe have made a strategy for the development and implementation of the Electronic Health Record Systems. This would mean greater access to health records by numerous stakeholders, even from countries with lower levels of privacy protection. The forthcoming implementation of the Cross Border Health Directive and the EU Commission&#x27;s plans to centralize all health records are of prime concern to the EU public who believe that the health care organizations and governments cannot be trusted to manage their data electronically and expose them to more threats.

The idea of a centralized electronic health record system was poorly received by the public who are wary that governments may use of the system beyond its intended purpose. There is also the risk for privacy breaches that could allow sensitive health care information to fall into the wrong hands. Some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information. These safeguards add protection for records that are shared electronically and give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.

===Breach notification===
The purpose of a personal data breach notification is to protect individuals so that they can take all the necessary actions to limit the undesirable effects of the breach and to motivate the organization to improve the security of the infrastructure to protect the confidentiality of the data. The US law requires the entities to inform the individuals in the event of breach while the EU Directive currently requires breach notification only when the breach is likely to adversely affect the privacy of the individual. Personal health data is valuable to individuals and is therefore difficult to make an assessment whether the breach will cause reputational or financial harm or cause adverse effects on one&#x27;s privacy.

The Breach notification law in the EU provides better privacy safeguards with fewer exemptions, unlike the US law which exempts unintentional acquisition, access, or use of protected health information and inadvertent disclosure under a good faith belief.

==Technical issues==

===Standards===
* ASC X12 (EDI) – transaction protocols used for transmitting patient data. Popular in the United States for transmission of billing data.
* CEN&#x27;s TC/251 provides EHR standards in Europe including:
** EN 13606, communication standards for EHR information
** CONTSYS (EN 13940), supports continuity of care record standardization.
** HISA (EN 12967), a services standard for inter-system communication in a clinical information environment.
* Continuity of Care Record – ASTM International Continuity of Care Record standard
* DICOM – an international communications protocol standard for representing and transmitting radiology (and other) image-based data, sponsored by NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association)
* HL7 (HL7v2, C-CDA) – a standardized messaging and text communications protocol between hospital and physician record systems, and between practice management systems
* Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) – a modernized proposal from HL7 designed to provide open, granular access to medical information
* ISO – ISO TC 215 provides international technical specifications for EHRs. ISO 18308 describes EHR architectures
* xDT – a family of data exchange formats for medical purposes that is used in the German public health system.

The U.S. federal government has issued new rules of electronic health records.

====Open specifications====
* openEHR: an open community developed specification for a shared health record with web-based content developed online by experts. Strong multilingual capability.
* Virtual Medical Record: HL7&#x27;s proposed model for interfacing with clinical decision support systems.
* SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps, reusable technologies): an open platform specification to provide a standard base for healthcare applications.

====Common data model (in health data context)====
A common data model (CDM) is a specification that describes how data from multiple sources (e.g., multiple EHR systems) can be combined. Many CDMs use a relational model (e.g., the OMOP CDM). A relational CDM defines names of tables and table columns and restricts what values are valid.
* Sentinel Common Data Model: Initially started as Mini-Sentinel in 2008. Use by the Sentinel Initiative of the USA&#x27;s Food and Drug Administration.
* OMOP Common Data Model: model that defines how electronic health record data, medical billing data or other healthcare data from multiple institutions can be harmonized and queried in unified way. It is maintained by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium.
* PCORNet Common Data Model: First defined in 2014 and used by PCORI and People-Centered Research Foundation.
* Virtual Data Warehouse: First defined in 2006 by HMO Research Network. Since 2015, by Health Care System Research Network.

====Customization====
Each healthcare environment functions differently, often in significant ways. It is difficult to create a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; EHR system. Many first generation EHRs were designed to fit the needs of primary care physicians, leaving certain specialties significantly less satisfied with their EHR system.

An ideal EHR system will have record standardization but interfaces that can be customized to each provider environment. Modularity in an EHR system facilitates this. Many EHR companies employ vendors to provide customization.

This customization can often be done so that a physician&#x27;s input interface closely mimics previously utilized paper forms.

At the same time they reported negative effects in communication, increased overtime, and missing records when a non-customized EMR system was utilized. Customizing the software when it is released yields the highest benefits because it is adapted for the users and tailored to workflows specific to the institution.

Customization can have its disadvantages. There is, of course, higher costs involved to implementation of a customized system initially. More time must be spent by both the implementation team and the healthcare provider to understand the workflow needs.

Development and maintenance of these interfaces and customizations can also lead to higher software implementation and maintenance costs.

===Long-term preservation and storage of records===
An important consideration in the process of developing electronic health records is to plan for the long-term preservation and storage of these records. The field will need to come to consensus on the length of time to store EHRs, methods to ensure the future accessibility and compatibility of archived data with yet-to-be developed retrieval systems, and how to ensure the physical and virtual security of the archives.

Additionally, considerations about long-term storage of electronic health records are complicated by the possibility that the records might one day be used longitudinally and integrated across sites of care. Records have the potential to be created, used, edited, and viewed by multiple independent entities. These entities include, but are not limited to, primary care physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients. Mandl et al. have noted that &quot;choices about the structure and ownership of these records will have profound impact on the accessibility and privacy of patient information.&quot;

The required length of storage of an individual electronic health record will depend on national and state regulations, which are subject to change over time. Ruotsalainen and Manning have found that the typical preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years. In one example of how an EHR archive might function, their research &quot;describes a co-operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which receives health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes EHR-data objects. TNA can store objects in XML-format and prove the integrity of stored data with the help of event records, timestamps and archive e-signatures.&quot;

In addition to the TNA archive described by Ruotsalainen and Manning, other combinations of EHR systems and archive systems are possible. Again, overall requirements for the design and security of the system and its archive will vary and must function under ethical and legal principles specific to the time and place.

While it is currently unknown precisely how long EHRs will be preserved, it is certain that length of time will exceed the average shelf-life of paper records. The evolution of technology is such that the programs and systems used to input information will likely not be available to a user who desires to examine archived data. One proposed solution to the challenge of long-term accessibility and usability of data by future systems is to standardize information fields in a time-invariant way, such as with XML language. Olhede and Peterson report that &quot;the basic XML-format has undergone preliminary testing in Europe by a Spri project and been found suitable for EU purposes. Spri has advised the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish National Archive to issue directives concerning the use of XML as the archive-format for EHCR (Electronic Health Care Record) information.&quot;

===Synchronization of records===
When care is provided at two different facilities, it may be difficult to update records at both locations in a co-ordinated fashion. Two models have been used to satisfy this problem: a centralized data server solution, and a peer-to-peer file synchronization program (as has been developed for other peer-to-peer networks). Synchronization programs for distributed storage models, however, are only useful once record standardization has occurred. Merging of already existing public healthcare databases is a common software challenge. The ability of electronic health record systems to provide this function is a key benefit and can improve healthcare delivery.

==eHealth and teleradiology==

The sharing of patient information between health care organizations and IT systems is changing from a &quot;point to point&quot; model to a &quot;many to many&quot; one. The European Commission is supporting moves to facilitate cross-border interoperability of e-health systems and to remove potential legal hurdles, as in the project www.epsos.eu/. To allow for global shared workflow, studies will be locked when they are being read and then unlocked and updated once reading is complete. Radiologists will be able to serve multiple health care facilities and read and report across large geographical areas, thus balancing workloads. The biggest challenges will relate to interoperability and legal clarity. In some countries it is almost forbidden to practice teleradiology. The variety of languages spoken is a problem and multilingual reporting templates for all anatomical regions are not yet available. However, the market for e-health and teleradiology is evolving more rapidly than any laws or regulations.

== Initiatives ==

===USA===

See Electronic health records in the United States

=== Russia ===
In 2011, Moscow&#x27;s government launched a major project known as UMIAS as part of its electronic healthcare initiative. UMIAS - the Unified Medical Information and Analytical System - connects more than 660 clinics and over 23,600 medical practitioners in Moscow. UMIAS covers 9.5 million patients, contains more than 359 million patient records and supports more than 500,000 different transactions daily. Approximately 700,000 Muscovites use remote links to make appointments every week.

=== European Union ===
The European Commission wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020. With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients&#x27; rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Lloyd George envelope digitisation project is the aim to have all paper copies of all historic patient data transferred onto computer systems. as part of the roll out new patients will no longer be given a transit label to register when moving practices. Not only is it a step closer to a Digital NHS and reduce the movement of records between practices, The Project also frees up space in practices that are used to store records as well as having the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly

Lyniate was selected to provide data integration technologies for Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland) in 2022. Epic Systems will supply integrated electronic health records with a single digital record for every citizen. Lyniate Rhapsody, already used in used in 79 NHS Trusts, will be used to integrate the multiple health and social care systems.

=== In veterinary medicine ===
In UK veterinary practice, the replacement of paper recording systems with electronic methods of storing animal patient information escalated from the 1980s and the majority of clinics now use electronic medical records. In a sample of 129 veterinary practices, 89% used a Practice Management System (PMS) for data recording. There are more than ten PMS providers currently in the UK. Collecting data directly from PMSs for epidemiological analysis abolishes the need for veterinarians to manually submit individual reports per animal visit and therefore increases the reporting rate.

Veterinary electronic medical record data are being used to investigate antimicrobial efficacy; risk factors for canine cancer; and inherited diseases in dogs and cats, in the small animal disease surveillance project &#x27;VetCOMPASS&#x27; (Veterinary Companion Animal Surveillance System) at the Royal Veterinary College, London, in collaboration with the University of Sydney (the VetCOMPASS project was formerly known as VEctAR).

==Turing test==
A letter published in Communications of the ACM describes the concept of generating synthetic patient population and proposes a variation of Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients. The letter states: &quot;In the EHR context, though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients, could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own?&quot; and further the letter states: &quot;Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem, the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Test-like techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value. Any new techniques must thus consider patients&#x27; heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighth-grade-science-test is able to grade.&quot;

<doc id="1129642" wikidata="Q7543605" url="?curid=1129642" title="Small v. United States">
<text>Small v. United States, 544 U.S. 385 (2005), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), which makes it illegal to possess a firearm for individuals previously &quot;convicted in any court&quot; of crimes for which they could have been sentenced to more than one year in prison. The Court ruled, in a five to three decision, that &quot;any court&quot; does not include those in foreign countries. This decision resolved a circuit split on the issue, and reversed the lower ruling of the Third Circuit that the law did apply to foreign convictions.

==Background==
In December 1992, Gary Sherwood Small was arrested for an apparent (and disputed) attempt to recover a water heater from Naha Airport in Okinawa, Japan. According to Japanese authorities, the water heater contained several pistols, a rifle, and ammunition. Small was convicted on 17 April 1994 by a Japanese court for violating the Japanese Act Controlling the Possession of Firearms and Swords, the Gunpowder Control Act, and the Customs Act, all of which were felonies (that is, offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year). Small was sentenced to five years in a Japanese prison, but was paroled in November 1996. His parole ended on 26 May 1998.

On 2 June 1998, shortly after his Japanese parole ended, Small purchased a handgun from the Delmont Sport Shop, a firearms dealer in the community where he resided. During the purchase process, Small filled out a form required by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). One of the questions on the form was &quot;Have you ever been convicted in any court of a crime for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if the judge actually gave you a shorter sentence?&quot; Small answered &quot;no&quot; to this question.

In 2000, during a routine check of gun purchases from firearms dealers, the ATF discovered that Small, who had served a prison sentence in Japan, had purchased a handgun in Pennsylvania. When they searched his apartment they found another gun and ammunition. According to the government, because Small had been convicted in Japan in 1994, when he purchased the handgun at the Delmont Sport Shop he violated Title 18 United States Code § 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful:

:(g) . . . for any person

::(1) who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year: . . .

:to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm.

==Prior legal history==

===District Court===
On 30 August 2000, a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted Small on four counts:

* one count of making a false statement to a federally licensed firearms dealer;
* one count of possession of ammunition by a convicted felon; and
* two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Upon his indictment, Small filed to have the case dismissed, arguing that foreign convictions should not count as a predicate offense under Section 922 because the statement &quot;any court&quot; within the statute was meant for U.S. convictions only. The district court denied the motion.

Small also argued that his Japanese offense should not count because he did not receive certain basic civil rights protections during his trial in Japan. Small requested that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing so that he could testify about the fairness of his conviction in Japan. The government responded that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing because Section 922 addresses the &quot;fact&quot; of a prior conviction, not the fairness of it. On 16 January 2002, the district court denied the motion because the Japanese Constitution protects similar rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. (Small argued that, while the same rights are protected in theory, in practice they are abused, citing several specific instances of incidents that would be considered violations of rights protected under the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.)

On 14 March 2002, Small conditionally pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, for which he was sentenced to eight months in jail and three years of supervised release. However, he remains free on bail pending the outcome of his appeals.

===Court of Appeals===
Small appealed the district court&#x27;s opinion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The appeals court upheld the district court&#x27;s ruling in a relatively short opinion, stating that the district court properly determined the fairness of the Japanese court&#x27;s proceedings as well as the opinion that &quot;any court&quot; applies to both foreign and domestic courts.

The appeals court did not acknowledge in its opinion a split among circuit courts. In the past 18 years, there have been four other cases on the same question. In the 1980s, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits held that foreign convictions could serve as predicate offenses under Section 922. More recently, the Tenth and Second Circuits have ruled that the term &quot;any court&quot; refers only to U.S. courts.

Following the opinion, Small filed for an en banc hearing of the case, which was denied.

==Supreme Court==
On 17 November 2003, Small filed a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The government did not oppose, citing an interest in &quot;being able to apply a uniform national rule in regulating or giving advice to persons with foreign convictions who seek to become licensed firearm importers, manufacturers, or dealers, or who seek to possess firearms.&quot; On 29 March 2004, the Court granted Certiorari, agreeing to hear the case.

Oral arguments were presented on 3 November 2004. The Supreme court ruled on April 26, 2005, in favor of Small, in a decision written by Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Stevens, O&#x27;Connor, Souter and Ginsburg. Justice Thomas, joined by Justices Scalia and Kennedy dissented. The majority opinion emphasised anomalies resulting from a reading of &quot;any court&quot; to include foreign courts. The dissent insisted on a literal interpretation of the word &quot;any&quot; and argued that applying the law to foreign convictions was not irrational enough to rebut the usual meaning of the word &quot;any&quot;.

==Possible ancillary effects==
One interesting aspect of this case is the potential to affect a minor section of the USA PATRIOT Act. As the government notes in its response to the request for Certiorari:

:Finally, Congress&#x27;s recent enactment of other legislation that predicates criminal liability on convictions entered &quot;in any court&quot; suggests that definitive guidance by this Court would be of value at this time. See 18 U.S.C. 175b(d)(2)(B) (prohibition on possession of biological weapons), added by Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, Title VIII, § 817(2), 115 Stat. 386 (Oct. 26, 2001).7

<text>The olf is a unit used to measure the strength of a pollution source. It was introduced by Danish professor P. Ole Fanger; the name &quot;olf&quot; is derived from the Latin word , meaning &quot;smelled&quot;.

One olf is the sensory pollution strength from a standard person defined as an average adult working in an office or similar non-industrial workplace, sedentary and in thermal comfort, with a hygienic standard equivalent of 0.7 baths per day and whose skin has a total area of 1.8 square metres. It was defined to quantify the strength of pollution sources that can be perceived by humans.

The perceived air quality is measured in decipol.

<doc id="1129654" wikidata="Q351330" url="?curid=1129654" title="Mitch Daniels">
<text>Mitchell Elias Daniels Jr. (born April 7, 1949) is an American academic administrator, businessman, author, and retired politician who served as the 49th governor of Indiana from 2005 to 2013. A Republican, he later served as president of Purdue University from 2013 until the end of 2022.

Daniels began his career as an assistant to senator Richard Lugar, working as his chief of staff in the Senate from 1977 to 1982. He was appointed executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee when Lugar was chairman from 1983 to 1984. He worked as a chief political advisor and as a liaison to President Ronald Reagan in 1985. He then moved back to Indiana to become president of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. He later joined Eli Lilly and Company where he served as president of North American Pharmaceutical Operations from 1993 to 1997 and as senior vice president of corporate strategy and policy from 1997 to 2001. In January 2001, Daniels was appointed by President George W. Bush as the director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, where he served until June 2003.

Daniels ran in Indiana&#x27;s 2004 gubernatorial election after leaving the Bush administration. He won the Republican primary with 67% of the vote and defeated Democratic incumbent Governor Joe Kernan in the general election. In 2008, Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating Jill Long Thompson. During his tenure, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, balanced the state budget through austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by labor unions and Democrats in the state legislature over Indiana&#x27;s school voucher program, privatization of public highways, and the attempt to pass &#x27;right to work&#x27; legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature&#x27;s last session under Daniels, he signed a &#x27;right-to-work law&#x27;, with Indiana becoming the 23rd state in the nation to pass such legislation.

It was widely speculated that Daniels would be a candidate in the 2012 presidential election, but he chose not to run. Shortly after, a search committee, composed mostly of Purdue faculty and administrators recommended Daniels to become the university&#x27;s 12th president after his term as governor ended on January 14, 2013. Ultimately, the hiring decision was made by the Trustees of the Board of Purdue University, all of whom Daniels appointed or re-appointed while Governor. He retired as Purdue president on January 1, 2023.

==Early life==

===Family and education===
Mitchell Elias Daniels Jr. was born on April 7, 1949, in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, the son of Dorothy Mae (née Wilkes) and Mitchell Elias Daniels. His father&#x27;s parents were Syrian immigrants from Qalatiyah, Syria, of Antiochian Greek Orthodox descent. Daniels has been honored by the Arab-American Institute with the 2011 Najeeb Halaby Award for Public Service. His mother&#x27;s ancestry was mostly English (where three of his great-grandparents were born). Daniels spent his early childhood years in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Georgia.

The Daniels family moved to Indiana from Tennessee in 1959 when his father accepted a job at the Indianapolis headquarters of the pharmaceutical company Pitman-Moore. The 10-year-old Daniels was accustomed to the mountains, and he at first disliked the flatland of central Indiana. He was still in grade school at the time of the move and first attended Delaware Trail Elementary, Westlane Junior High School, and North Central High School. In high school he was student body president. After graduation in 1967, Daniels was named one of Indiana&#x27;s Presidential Scholars—the state&#x27;s top male high school graduate that year—by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 1971, Daniels earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Politics of Metropolitanization: City-County Consolidation in Indianapolis, Indiana&quot;. While at Princeton, he was a member of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, where he overlapped with future Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who was a year below. He initially studied law at the Indiana McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis. After accepting a job with newly elected Senator Richard Lugar, he transferred to the Georgetown University Law Center, from which he earned a Juris Doctor.

===Drug arrest===
In 1970, while an undergraduate at Princeton, Daniels and three roommates were a part of a several months long drug investigation that began on Saturday, March 7, 1970, when one of Daniels&#x27;s roommates was arrested for possessing &quot;large quantities&quot; of marijuana and other drugs. Two months later police raided the same residence hall, finding enough marijuana to fill two size 12 shoeboxes and arresting five additional individuals, including Daniels. Daniels and a roommate were charged with possession of marijuana, LSD and other drugs, along with &quot;maintaining a common nuisance&quot; for allowing the room to be used for the sale and use of drugs. In a plea agreement, the prosecutor dropped the charges in exchange for Daniels agreeing to pay a fine of $350 for using marijuana.

Thirty-four years after the arrest, the first roommate detained (the individual arrested months before Daniels), told the Indianapolis Star that he was a partisan Democrat who &quot;would gladly offer unflattering information about a Republican—if he had any&quot; but Daniels had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with selling drugs. Another roommate said that police obtained a warrant to search the room based on the activity of the first roommate arrested. &quot;Unbeknownst to [Daniels and the other current roommates] ... [he] was coming back there and using the room when we&#x27;re not there and was involved with drugs much worse than pot...We considered ourselves innocent victims.&quot; Daniels refutes the idea that he was innocent saying he &quot;had used marijuana&quot; and &quot;was fined for that, and that was appropriate&quot;. Daniels has disclosed the arrest on job applications and in government background checks and spoken about the incident in opinion columns.

In a 1989 opinion piece in The Washington Post, Daniels called the incident the &quot;unfortunate confluence of my wild oats period and America&#x27;s libertine apogee&quot; and said &quot;On my college campus, just as on most college campuses, marijuana was as easy to obtain as Budweiser beer and was viewed with equal complacency. For a time, I was a carefree consumer of both.&quot; Daniels claimed his &quot;young Midwestern tail was jerked back into line&quot; following the arrest.

===Early political career===

Daniels had his first experience in politics while still a teenager when, in 1968, he worked on the unsuccessful campaign of fellow Hoosier and Princeton alumnus William Ruckelshaus, who was running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh. After the campaign, Daniels secured an internship in the office of then-Indianapolis mayor Richard Lugar, a Ruckelshaus ally. Daniels worked on Lugar&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1971, and later, in 1974, he worked on Lugar&#x27;s first campaign for Senate via L. Keith Bulen&#x27;s Campaign Communicators, Inc, a political consultancy where Daniels served as vice president. Daniels joined Lugar&#x27;s mayoral staff in December 1974. Within three years, he became Lugar&#x27;s principal assistant. After Lugar was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Daniels followed him to Washington, D.C., as his Chief of Staff.

Daniels served as Chief of Staff during Lugar&#x27;s first term (1977–1982).

== Personal life ==
During Daniels&#x27; time working with Senator Lugar, he met Cheri Herman, who was working for the National Park Service. The two married in 1978 and had four daughters. They divorced in 1993 and Cheri married again; Cheri later divorced her second husband and remarried Daniels in 1997.

== Early career in Washington, D.C. ==
In 1983, when Lugar was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Daniels was appointed its executive director. Serving in that position (1983–84), he played a major role in keeping the GOP in control of the Senate. Daniels was also manager of three successful re-election campaigns for Lugar.

In August 1985, Daniels became chief political advisor and to state and local governments for President Ronald Reagan.

As part of this position, Daniels led the Reagan administration&#x27;s response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, regarding the Fair Labor Standards Act, and advocated limiting the power of the federal government in defining overtime rules for state and local governments, summing up his position by asking &quot;What business is it of the Federal Government to tell localities how to structure their personnel practices?&quot;.

In 1987, Daniels returned to Indiana as president and CEO of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. In 1988, Dan Quayle was elected Vice President of the United States, and Indiana governor Robert D. Orr offered to appoint Daniels to Quayle&#x27;s vacant Senate seat. Daniels declined the offer, saying it would force him to spend too much time away from his family.

While serving as the executive director of the Senate Republican campaign committee, Daniels expressed concern about the honesty of Illinois elections saying in 1984, &quot;ballot integrity will be the single most decisive factor in the Illinois Senate race&quot;, a theme Daniels has returned to throughout his career.

===Eli Lilly===
In 1990, Daniels left the Hudson Institute to accept a position at Eli Lilly and Company, the largest corporation headquartered in Indiana at that time. He was first promoted to President of North American Operations (1993–97) and then to Senior Vice President for Corporate Strategy and Policy (1997–2001). 

During his tenure Lilly pleaded guilty to two criminal misdemeanors, paid more than $2.7 billion in fines and damages, settled more than 32,000 personal injury claims—and copped to one of the largest state consumer protection cases involving a drug company in U.S. history. In 2009, Lilly also pleaded guilty for illegally marketing Zyprexa during Daniels&#x27; tenure and agreed to pay a $1.415 billion penalty that included a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind at the time.

Daniels managed strategy to deflect attacks on Lilly&#x27;s Prozac product by a public relations campaign against the drug being waged by the Church of Scientology. In one interview in 1992, Daniels said of the organization that &quot;it is no church&quot;, and that people on Prozac were less likely to become victims of the organization. The Church of Scientology responded by suing Daniels in a libel suit for $20 million. A judge dismissed the case.

Eli Lilly experienced dramatic growth during Daniels&#x27;s tenure at the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly&#x27;s income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became governor of Indiana, he drew heavily on his former Lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers.

During the same period, Daniels also served on the board of directors of the Indianapolis Power &amp; Light (IPL). He resigned from the IPL Board in 2001 to join the federal government, and sold his IPL stock along with all other holdings in order to comply with federal ethics requirements. Later that year the value declined when Virginia-based AES Corporation bought IPL.

==Office of Management and Budget==

On December 22, 2000, President-elect George W. Bush announced that he would nominate Daniels to serve as the director of the Office of Management and Budget. and was confirmed by the United States Senate by a vote of 100–0 on January 23, 2001. In this role he was also a member of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council.

During his time as the director of the OMB, Daniels sought to restrict congressional spending, saying Congress&#x27;s motto apparently is &quot;Don&#x27;t just stand there, spend something.&quot; During his tenure he was criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike. After his first year in office Senator Ted Stevens, then the ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, suggested &#x27;the best thing Daniels could do to repair relations with Congress was to go back to Indiana&#x27;. Representative Bill Young, then chairman of the United States House Committee on Appropriations complained about Daniels&#x27; leadership saying &quot;I&#x27;m convinced the director of O.M.B. is only concerned about numbers ... and he has no concern about what those numbers do or do not do for the country, for our military, for our security.&quot; Then HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson complained that Daniels&#x27;s office would reject a proposal &quot;nine times out of 10, just to show you who the boss is&quot;. The $2.13 trillion budget Daniels submitted to Congress in 2001 would have made deep cuts in many agencies to accommodate the tax cuts being made, but few of the spending cuts were actually approved by Congress. Shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, Daniels gave a speech to the National Press Club in which he challenged the view of those who wanted to continue typical spending while the nation was at war. &quot;The idea of reallocating assets from less important to more important things, especially in a time of genuine emergency, makes common sense and is applied everywhere else in life,&quot; he said. Despite such efforts, during Daniels&#x27;s 29-month tenure in the position, the projected federal budget surplus of $236 billion ballooned to a $400 billion deficit, due to the recession of 2001, tax cuts, the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021), and Iraq War.

Nobel economics Laureate Paul Krugman noted Daniels is &quot;held up as an icon of fiscal responsibility&quot; without having earned it. Commenting on Daniels leadership he wrote &quot;what I can&#x27;t forget is his key role in the squandering of the fiscal surplus Bush inherited. It wasn&#x27;t just that he supported the Bush tax cuts; the excuses he made for that irresponsibility were stunningly fraudulent. So I just can&#x27;t take his current pose of deficit hawkishness seriously.&quot;

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress passed legislation authorizing the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Just before the legislation was signed by Bush, Republican lawmakers inserted language into the bill that authorized protection from liability corporations that manufactured thimerosal, a controversial vaccine preservative that has been the subject of multiple lawsuits. Eli Lilly was once the largest maker of thimerosal and is a major target of the lawsuits. Daniels was the budget director at the time of the bill&#x27;s passing and some have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Congress repealed the thimerosal provision following expressions of public displeasure.

Conservative columnist Ross Douthat stated in a column about Daniels&#x27;s time at OMB that Daniels &quot;carried water, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, for some of the Bush administration&#x27;s more egregious budgets.&quot; But Douthat, while calling Daniels &quot;America&#x27;s Best Governor&quot;, defended Daniels against accusations that Daniels inaccurately assessed the costs of the Iraq war.

In 2002, Daniels helped discredit a report by Assistant to the President on Economic Policy Lawrence B. Lindsey estimating the cost of the Iraq War at between $100-$200 billion. Daniels called this estimate &quot;very, very high&quot; and stated that the costs would be between $50-$60 billion. At the time Daniels would not provide specific costs for either a long or a short military campaign against Saddam Hussein, saying the administration was budgeting for both. The failure to provide long term cost estimates led opponents to claim that Daniels and the administration had suggested the entire war would cost less than $60 billion. The CBO has estimated the total cost of the war in Iraq to U.S. taxpayers will be around $1.9 trillion if it was carried on until 2017.

Three months later, on March 25, 2003, five days after the start of the invasion, President Bush requested $53 billion through an emergency supplemental appropriation to cover operational expenses in Iraq until September 30 of that year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Military operations in Iraq for 2003 cost $46 billion, less than the amount projected by Daniels and OMB. Douthat and other defenders of Daniels accuse Daniels&#x27;s critics of mischaracterizing the six-month supplemental appropriation as a request to fund the entire war.

The costs of the Iraq war have exceeded $800 billion. Between September 2001 and October 2012, lawmakers appropriated about $1.4 trillion for operations in both the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On May 7, 2003, Daniels announced that he would resign as OMB director within 30 days in a move that Bush administration officials said was to prepare to run for governor of Indiana.

==49th Governor of Indiana (2005–2013) ==

===Election campaign===
Daniels&#x27;s decision to run for Governor of Indiana led to most of the rest of Republican field of candidates dropping out of the race. The only challenger who did not do so was conservative activist and lobbyist Eric Miller. Miller worked for the Phoenix Group, a Christian rights defense group. Daniels&#x27;s campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies. He won the primary with 67% of the vote.

While campaigning in the general election, Daniels visited all 92 counties at least three times. He traveled in a donated white RV nicknamed &quot;RV-1&quot; and covered with signatures of supporters and his campaign slogan, &quot;My Man Mitch&quot;. &quot;My Man Mitch&quot; was a reference to a phrase once used by President George W. Bush to refer to Daniels. Bush campaigned with Daniels on two occasions, as Daniels hoped that Bush&#x27;s popularity would help him secure a win. In his many public stops, he frequently used the phrase &quot;every garden needs weeding every sixteen years or so&quot;; it had been 16 years since Indiana had had a Republican governor. His opponent in the general election was the incumbent, Joe Kernan, who had succeeded to the office upon the death of Frank O&#x27;Bannon. Campaign ads by Kernan and the Democratic Party attempted to tie Daniels to number of issues—his jail time for marijuana use; a stock sale leading to speculations of insider trading; and, because of his role at Eli Lilly, the high cost of prescription drugs. The 2004 election was the costliest in Indiana history, up until that time, with the candidates spending a combined US$23 million. Daniels won the election, garnering about 53% of the vote compared to Kernan&#x27;s 45%. Kernan was the first incumbent governor to lose an election in Indiana since 1892.

===First term===

On his first day in office, Daniels created Indiana&#x27;s first Office of Management and Budget to look for inefficiencies and cost savings throughout state government. The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by executive order, removing the requirement that state employees pay union dues by rescinding a mandate created by Governor Evan Bayh in a 1989 executive order. Dues-paying union membership subsequently dropped 90% among all state employees.

====Budgetary measures====
In his first State of the State address on January 18, 2005, Daniels put forward his agenda to improve the state&#x27;s fiscal situation. Indiana has a budget, and had a projected two-year deficit of $800 million. Daniels called for strict controls on all spending increases and reducing the annual growth rate of the budget. He also proposed a one-year 1% tax increase on all individuals and entities earning over $100,000. The taxing proposal was controversial and the Republican Speaker of the House, Brian Bosma, criticized Daniels and refused to allow the proposal to be debated.

The General Assembly approved $250 million in spending cuts and Daniels renegotiated 30 different state contracts for a savings of $190 million, resulting in a budget of $23 billion. Annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to 2.8% from the 5.9% that had been standard for many years. Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. Indiana is not permitted to take loans, as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the 1837 state bankruptcy. The state, therefore, had financed its deficit spending by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts over the course of many years. The funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money, and the state reserve fund was grown to $1.3 billion.

Two of Daniels&#x27;s other tax proposals were approved: a tax on liquor and beverages to fund the construction of the Lucas Oil Stadium and a tax on rental cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The new source of funding resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the city of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.

In 2006, Daniels continued his effort to reduce state operating costs by signing into law a bill privatizing the enrollment service for the state&#x27;s welfare programs. Indiana&#x27;s welfare enrollment facilities were replaced with call centers operated by IBM. In mid-2009, after complaints of poor service, Daniels canceled the contract and returned the enrollment service to the public sector.

====Daylight Saving Time====
One of the most controversial measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of Daylight Saving Time, which Daniels argued, in a complicated economy, was needed to end constant confusion and bring Indiana into a year-long alignment with the rest of the country. Prior to the change, the counties in the western side of the state did not observe daylight saving time, although the counties in southeastern Indiana near Cincinnati, Ohio, did observe it unofficially due to being in that city&#x27;s metropolitan area. Interests for both time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1960s, leading to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, the General Assembly adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005. The measure passed by one vote and put most of the state on the Eastern Time Zone, except for counties in the northwest and southwest corners that are in the Central Time Zone.

====Highways====
In 2006 the legislature enacted Daniels&#x27; controversial plan to remake the state&#x27;s highways system by leasing the Indiana Toll Road. Called the Major Moves, the road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia&#x27;s Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years in exchange for a one time payment of $3.85 billion and the commitment to make $4.4 billion worth of upgrades to the road.

Most Democrats opposed the measure by starting an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. Other critics characterized the deal for fundamentally changing the relationship between infrastructure and taxpayers&quot; saying &quot;the road intended to serve the people of Indiana now is serving the profit needs of a multinational corporation&quot;.

Daniels defended the lease, claiming that the road was not earning the state money because of the historical lack of political will to raise tolls. He told a congressional committee, &quot;...instead of making money for the state, the road had operated at a loss for 5 of the previous 7 years...Political timidity had kept tolls locked at the same price since 1985...Even if we raised the tolls, there was little reason to believe that the governors who would come after me would have the inclination or the political ability to do the same. I once asked how much it cost to collect that 15-cent toll on the road and the answer came back at 34 cents. I joked that we would have been better off with the honor system and a fishbowl for occasional donations.&quot;

Daniels and an independent accounting firm believed the road was worth $2 billion at most and were surprised by the offer of nearly $4 billion in cash, plus that much in contracted improvements. Daniels called it the best deal since &quot;Manhattan was sold for beads—except this time, the natives won.&quot;

Initially, Daniels&#x27;s support for the controversial legislation led to a rapid drop in his approval rating; in May 2005, a poll showed an 18-point drop in support and that only 42% of Hoosiers approved of the way he was doing his job. In the following months, many of his reforms appeared to have a positive effect and his approval ratings rebounded.

The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system. Local governments also received a significant windfall from the deal, including $150 million that went to Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties for local roads, $240 million to seven counties for infrastructure and economic development projects, and $120 million for the Northwest Regional Development Authority for local economic development. Over the next ten years, Indiana would use the cash and interest from the deal to add or expand several major new roadways such as US 31, the Hoosier Heartland Highway, I-69, and the Ohio River bridges. It also rehabilitated 1,400 bridges and 50% of the state&#x27;s roads without using tax dollars or taking on new debt.

As anticipated, drivers experienced dramatic hikes in tolls after the lease, which increased the cost to travel on the public road from $4.65 to $8.80 for passenger vehicles, and semitrailer trucks from $18 to $35.20. Despite doubling toll prices, the foreign-owned operator of the toll road filed for bankruptcy in 2014, and its $3.85 billion purchase price resulted in $6 billion in debts owed by the company to its financiers. Indiana retained the $3.85 billion lump sum payment and the lease was transferred to another Australian investment company without altering the terms of the lease.

An October 2014 ITR report to the Indiana Toll Road Oversight Board cited numerous deficiencies along the highway including: deficient pavements and signage at travel plazas, activities at vehicle maintenance facilities that could allow petroleum products or other chemicals into open storm water drains, and closed sewage dump stations at risk of unmonitored dumping. In response, the new lease owners pledged to invest $260 million in capital improvements. In June 2015, Ken Daley, the new CEO of the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company, announced that all of the original 1955 travel plazas would be demolished and replaced within the next five years. As of October 2015, the Booth Tarkington service area, the easternmost in Indiana, was permanently closed.[&quot;&quot;]

====Healthy Indiana Plan====
In 2007, Daniels signed the Healthy Indiana Plan, which provided 132,000 uninsured Indiana workers with coverage. The program works by helping its beneficiaries purchase a private health insurance policy with a subsidy from the state. The plan promotes health screenings, early prevention services, and smoking cessation. It also provides tax credits for small businesses that create qualified wellness and Section 125 plans. The plan was paid for by an increase in the state&#x27;s tax on cigarettes and the reallocation of federal Medicaid funds through a special waiver granted by the federal government. In a September 15, 2007, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; column, Daniels was quoted as saying about the Healthy Indiana Plan and cigarette tax increase saying, &quot;A consumption tax on a product you&#x27;d just as soon have less of doesn&#x27;t violate the rules I learned under Ronald Reagan.&quot;

The plan allows low to moderate income households where the members have no access to employer provided healthcare to apply for coverage. At the time of initial implementation, the fee for coverage was calculated using a formula that resulted in a charge between 2%–5% of a person&#x27;s income. A $1,100 annual deductible was standard on all policies and allowed applicants to qualify for a health savings account. The plan paid a maximum of $300,000 in annual benefits.

====Property tax reform====

In 2008, Daniels proposed a property tax ceiling of one percent on residential properties, two percent for rental properties and three percent for businesses. The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly on March 14, 2008, and signed by Daniels on March 19, 2008. In 2008, Indiana homeowners had an average property tax cut of more than 30 percent; a total of $870 million in tax cuts. Most money collected through property taxes funds local schools and county government. To offset the loss in revenues to the municipal bodies, the state raised the sales tax from 6% to 7% effective April 1, 2008.

Fearing a future government might overturn the statute enforcing property tax rate caps, Daniels and other state Republican leaders pressed for an amendment to add the new tax limits to the state constitution. The proposed amendment was placed on the 2010 General election ballot and was a major focus of Daniels&#x27;s reelection campaign. In November 2010, voters elected to adopt the tax caps into the Indiana Constitution.

Daniels&#x27;s successes at balancing the state budget began to be recognized nationally near the end of his first term. Daniels was named on the 2008 &quot;Public Officials of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Governing&quot; magazine. The same year, he received the 2008 Urban Innovator Award from the Manhattan Institute for his ideas for dealing with the state&#x27;s fiscal and urban problems.

====Voter registration====

In the 2005 session of the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, successfully enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law was the first of its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, opposed the bill, saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who might be unable to afford an ID or be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.

A coalition of civil rights groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels administration defended the government in the case. The U.S. District Court granted summary judgment to the state. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the U.S. District Court decision in the case of &quot;Crawford v. Marion County Election Board&quot;. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.

===Reelection campaign===


Daniels entered the 2008 election year with a 51% approval rate, and 28% disapproval rate. Daniels&#x27;s reelection campaign focused on the state&#x27;s unemployment rate, which had decreased during his time in office, the proposed property tax reform amendment, and the successful balancing of the state budget during his first term.

On November 4, 2008, Daniels defeated Democratic candidate Jill Long Thompson and was elected to a second term as governor with 57.8% of votes, despite Barack Obama carrying the state in the presidential race. He was re-inaugurated on January 12, 2009. &quot;Washington Post&quot; blogger Chris Cillizza named the Daniels reelection campaign &quot;The Best Gubernatorial Campaign of 2008&quot; and noted that some Republicans were already bandying about his name for the 2012 presidential election. Daniels garnered 20 percent of the African American vote and 37 percent of Latinos in his 2008 re-election campaign. He won with more votes than any candidate in the state&#x27;s history.

On July 14, 2010, at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Daniels was on hand to help announce the return of IndyCar Series chassis manufacturing to the state of Indiana. Dallara Automobili would build a new technology center in Speedway, Indiana and the state of Indiana would subsidize the sale of the first 28 IndyCar chassis with a $150,000 discount.

Daniels has been recognized for his commitment to fiscal discipline. He is a recent recipient of the Herman Kahn Award from the Hudson Institute, of which he is a former president and CEO, and was one of the first to receive the Fiscy award for fiscal discipline. A November 2010 poll gave Daniels a 75% approval rate.

===Second term===

Democrats won a majority in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections, resulting in Indiana having a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor&#x27;s office and the Indiana Senate. This led to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Daniels to call a special session of the General Assembly. Due to the national financial crisis, the state was faced with a $1.4 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–2011 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state&#x27;s reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.

====2011 legislative walkout====

In the 2010 mid-term elections, Republican super-majorities regained control of the House, and took control of the Senate, giving the party full control of General Assembly for the first time in Daniels&#x27;s tenure as governor. The 2011 Indiana General Assembly&#x27;s regular legislative session began in January and the large Republicans majorities attempted to implement a wide-ranging conservative agenda largely backed by Daniels. Most of the agenda had been dormant since Daniels&#x27;s election due to divided control of the assembly. In February, Republican legislators attempted to pass a right to work bill in the Indiana House of Representatives. The bill would have made it illegal for employees to be required to join a workers&#x27; union. Republicans argued that it would help the state attract new employers. Unable to prevent the measure from passing, Democratic legislators fled the state to deny the body a quorum while several hundred protesters staged demonstrations at the capital. Minority walkouts are somewhat common in the state, occurring as recently as 2005.

While Daniels supported the legislation, he believed the Republican lawmakers should drop the bill because it was not part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate. Republicans subsequently dropped the bill, but the Democratic lawmakers still refused to return to the capital, demanding additional bills be tabled, including a bill to create a statewide school voucher program. Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation, until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on March 28. The minority subsequently returned to the statehouse to resume their duties.

Daniels was interviewed in February 2011 about the similar 2011 Wisconsin budget protests in Madison. While supporting the Wisconsin Republicans, he said that in Indiana &quot;we&#x27;re not in quite the same position or advocating quite the same things they are up in Madison.&quot;

====Education====
Following the legislative walkouts, the assembly began passing most of the agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% of the cost of their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program was gradually phased in over a three-year period and became available to all state residents by 2014.

Other funds were redirected to creating and expanding charter schools and expanding college scholarship programs. The law also created a merit pay system to give better performing teachers higher wages, gave broader authority to school superintendents to terminate the employment of teachers, and restricted the collective bargaining rights of teachers.

WGU Indiana was established through an executive order on June 14, 2010, by Daniels, as a partnership between the state and Western Governors University in an effort to expand access to higher education for Indiana residents and increase the percentage of the state&#x27;s adult population with education beyond high school.

===== Attempt to ban the teaching of Howard Zinn =====
In July 2013, the Associated Press obtained emails under Indiana open record laws in which Daniels asked for assurances that a textbook, &quot;The People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;, written by historian Howard Zinn &quot;is not in use anywhere in Indiana&quot;. Daniels wrote in 2010, &quot;This crap should not be accepted for any credit by the state.&quot; Daniels&#x27;s e-mails were addressed to Scott Jenkins, his education adviser, and David Shane, a top fundraiser and state school board member. Daniels and his aides came to agreement and the governor wrote to them, &quot;Go for it. Disqualify propaganda . ... &quot; Part of Shane&#x27;s input was that a statewide review &quot;would force to daylight a lot of excrement&quot;. Though Teresa Lubbers, the state commissioner of higher education, was mentioned in the e-mails regarding the statewide review of courses, she later said that she &quot;was never asked to conduct the survey of courses described in the e-mail exchanges, and that her office did not conduct such a survey&quot;.

In one of the emails, Daniels expressed contempt for Zinn upon his death:

This terrible anti-American academic has finally passed away ... The obits and commentaries mentioned his book, &#x27;A People&#x27;s History of the United States,&#x27; is the &#x27;textbook of choice in high schools and colleges around the country.&#x27; It is a truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on every page. Can someone assure me that it is not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, how do we get rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history?

Three years later, in the wake of the revelations, 90 of Purdue&#x27;s roughly 1,800 professors issued an open letter expressing their concern over Daniels&#x27;s commitment to academic freedom. Daniels responded by saying that if Zinn were alive and a member of the Purdue faculty, he would defend his free speech rights and right to publish. In a letter responding to the professors, Daniels wrote, &quot;In truth, my emails infringed on no one&#x27;s academic freedom and proposed absolutely no censorship of any person or viewpoint.&quot;

In a separate and unrelated round of emails composed in 2009, Indiana education officials shared concerns with Daniels about the lobbying resources and activities of the Indiana Urban Schools Association. Daniels asked that the administration &quot;examine cutting them out, at least of the [funding] &#x27;surge&#x27; we are planning for the next couple yrs.&quot; The executive director of IUSA is Charles Little, an Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis professor of education, who had criticized him. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear if the audit went through. Daniels said he had never heard of Charles Little.

In response to the controversy, Daniels&#x27;s office issued a statement that included several quotes that had also appeared in an article published in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine by journalist Michael Moynihan. as well as a quote from a Stanford University news release, leading to accusations of plagiarism.

Daniels later revised his statement stating he &quot;axed the words of a Stanford University professor who expressed irritation with being included in the original remarks&quot; while also removing the quotes that appeared in the Reason article.

====Economy====
Raising Hoosier incomes was a key focus of his tenure as governor. Critics argue that during his administration Indiana&#x27;s per capita income dropped from 33rd to 38th among states, growing slightly slower than the national average, and the percentage of people living in poverty in Indiana rose from 10.2% to 14.9%. Supporters argue that economic progress was delayed by the Great Recession and when adjusted for Indiana&#x27;s low cost of living, Hoosier incomes actually climbed following Daniels&#x27; leadership and Indiana rebounded from the recession faster than the rest of the nation in job growth and consumer spending.


====Abortion====
On April 27, 2011, the Indiana legislature passed a bill authored by State Representative Eric Turner that prohibited taxpayer dollars from supporting organizations that performed abortions. The legislation also prohibited abortions for women more than 20 weeks pregnant, four weeks sooner than the previous law. Although Daniels would later say he supported the bill from the outset, it was not part of his legislative agenda and he did not indicate whether he would sign or veto the law until after it passed the General Assembly. Daniels signed the bill on May 10, 2011. Critics claimed Daniels signed the bill with full knowledge that he was &quot;courting an expensive and time-consuming lawsuit&quot; and &quot;would threaten federal funds&quot;, specifically &quot;the loss of $4 billion that funds its Medicaid program&quot;. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wrote in response &quot;Indiana can either rethink its new law, or violate the Medicaid statute. It can&#x27;t do both.&quot;

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU subsequently brought a lawsuit against the state alleging it was being targeted unfairly, that the state law violated federal Medicaid laws, and that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. A June 24 ruling prohibited the state from enforcing the law
and the court later ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood citing the &quot;freedom of choice&quot; provision. The State of Indiana appealed the ruling and the Seventh Circuit Court upheld the lower courts ruling in part.

====Immigration====
On May 10, 2011, Daniels signed into law two immigration bills; one denying in-state tuition prices to illegal immigrants and another one imposing fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants. Several protestors, at least five of whom were illegal immigrants, were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into Daniels&#x27;s office after being denied a meeting. Student leaders called for their release, while some state legislators called for their deportation.

State Democratic Party leaders accused Daniels and the Republicans of passing controversial legislation only to enhance Daniels&#x27;s image so he could seek the presidency. Daniels, however, denied the charges, saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the then-Democratic majority permitted him to do so.

====Budget cuts====
The state forecast continued revenue declines in 2010 that would result in a $1.7 billion budget shortfall if the state budget grew at its normal rate. Daniels submitted a two-year $27.5 billion spending plan to the General Assembly which would result in a $500 million surplus that would be used to rebuild the state reserve funds to $1 billion. He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees per capita of any state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation&#x27;s smallest government.

Daniels backed the creation of additional toll roads, expanding on his 2006 overhaul of the Indiana Toll Road system (known as &quot;Major Moves&quot;), in an attempt to secure an additional source of revenue for the state. But opposition from within his own party led to the bill being withdrawn by its Republican sponsor, Sen. Tom Wyss, Daniels&#x27;s only significant legislative defeat during the 2011 session.

The legislative walkouts delayed progress on the budget passage for nearly two months, but the House of Representatives was able to begin working on it in committee in April. The body made several alterations to the bill, including a reapportionment of education funding based more heavily on the number of students at a school, and removing some public school funding to finance the new voucher system and charter schools.

====Energy====
Daniels announced in October 2006 that a substitute natural gas company intended to build a facility in southern Indiana that would produce pipeline quality substitute natural gas (SNG). The lead investor was Leucadia National, which proposed a $2.6 billion plant in Rockport, Indiana. Under the terms of the deal endorsed by Daniels, the state would buy almost all the Rockport gas and resell it on the open market throughout the country. If the plant made money from the sale, excess profits would be split between Leucadia National&#x27;s Indiana subsidiary, Indiana Gassification, and the state. If it lost money from the sale, then 100% of the losses would be passed onto Indiana consumers. Leucadia agreed to reimburse the state for any losses, up to $150 million over 30 years. Gas from the plant would make up about 17 percent of the state&#x27;s supply. Critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next 30 years, the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents after the $150 million guarantee by Leucadia was exhausted. The deal also received criticism concerning government intrusion in the energy markets. Questions were also raised because Leucadia National hired Mark Lubbers, a former aide and close friend of Daniels, to promote the deal. The Daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of the state and offer environmental benefits through an in-state energy source. The project was ultimately rejected by the state legislature in 2013.

====Right to Work====
Indiana became the first state in a decade to adopt Right to Work legislation. Indiana is home to many manufacturing jobs. The Indiana Economic Development Corp. has reported that 90 firms said the new law was an important factor in deciding to move to Indiana. Daniels signed the legislation on February 1, 2012, without much fanfare in the hopes of dispersing labor protesters before the Super Bowl in Indianapolis.

==2012 presidential speculation==
Although Daniels had claimed to be reluctant to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, CNN, &quot;The Economist&quot;, and &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; began to speculate that Daniels intended to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority Congress and the White House in August 2010. The speculation included Daniels&#x27;s record of reforming government, reducing taxes, balancing the budget, and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he angered some conservatives because of his call for a &quot;truce&quot; on social issues so the party could focus on fiscal issues. His &quot;willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit&quot; was another source of contention.

In August 2010, &quot;The Economist&quot; praised Daniels&#x27;s &quot;reverence for restraint and efficacy&quot; and concluded that &quot;he is, in short, just the kind of man to relish fixing a broken state—or country.&quot; Nick Gillespie of &quot;Reason&quot; called Daniels &quot;a smart and effective leader who is a serious thinker about history, politics, and policy&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Daniels, like former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, is a Republican who knows how to govern and can do it well.&quot; In February 2011, David Brooks of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Daniels as the &quot;Party&#x27;s strongest [would be] candidate&quot;, predicting that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t match Obama in grace and elegance, but he could on substance.&quot;

On December 12, 2010, Daniels suggested in a local interview that he would decide on a White House run before May 2011.

Various groups and individuals pressured Daniels to run for office. In response to early speculation, Daniels dismissed a presidential run in June 2009, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve only ever run for or held one office. It&#x27;s the last one I&#x27;m going to hold.&quot; However, in February 2010 he told a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter that he was open to the idea of running in 2012.

On March 6, 2011, Daniels was the winner of an Oregon (Republican Party) straw poll. Daniels drew 29.33% of the vote, besting second place finisher Mitt Romney (22.66%) and third place finisher Sarah Palin (18.22%), and was the winner of a similar straw poll in the state of Washington. On May 5, 2011, Daniels told an interviewer that he would announce &quot;within weeks&quot; his decision of whether or not to run for the Republican presidential nomination. He said he felt he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues, such as foreign policy, and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions. Later in May, as the Republican field began to resolve with announcements and withdrawals of other candidates, &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;Even setting aside his somewhat unusual family situation, Daniels would need to hurry to put together an organization&quot; and raise enough money if he intended to run.

Daniels announced he would not seek the Republican nomination for the presidency on the night of May 21, 2011, via an email to the press, citing family constraints and the loss of privacy the family would experience should he become a candidate. In 2021 it was alleged by Max Eden, who led the Draft Daniels Student Group which provided much of the pressure for Daniels to run, that potentially damaging information was being held by some members of the Jon Huntsman campaign, chiefly John Weaver, the political advisor of the Huntsman campaign, regarding Daniels&#x27;s wife. Eden also stated that Weaver had contacted him about a &quot;seat at the table&quot; of the Huntsman campaign, and further went on to state that Huntsman, then a potential top candidate for the Republican nomination, was himself unaware of Weaver&#x27;s actions. Eden stated that the potential backlash from Weaver&#x27;s information was a large contributor to Daniels&#x27;s decision not to seek the Republican nomination, among other privacy concerns.

==2016 presidential speculation==
In January 2014, the Republican National Committee sent an email to subscribers, asking them to pick their top three presidential choices. The poll included 32 potential candidates, including Daniels. In March 2015, Fortune Magazine named Daniels No. 41 on its list of the world&#x27;s 50 greatest leaders, generating a new round of calls for Daniels to consider his options in 2016. Daniels was the only American university president and one of two national political figures to make the global list.

==President of Purdue University==
===Controversy over Selection===

As Daniels&#x27; second term as governor neared an end, a search committee recommended Daniels to the Purdue University Board of Trustees as a candidate to become the university&#x27;s 12th president. The committee was composed of 14 individuals: 5 members of the faculty, 3 administrators, 4 trustees, a student government leader and William Funk, the CEO of an executive search firm that has recruited hundreds of university presidents. Daniels&#x27; selection had the &quot;full endorsement of the search committee&quot; when on June 21, 2012, the Board unanimously elected Daniels to the position. 

As governor, Daniels had appointed eight of the ten board members and had reappointed the other two, which critics claimed was a conflict of interest. A state investigation released in October 2012 found that the circumstances did not violate the Indiana Code of Ethics. Other critics of his selection pointed out that, unlike all previous Purdue presidents, he lacked experience in academia. His term as president began upon completion of his term as governor in January 2013. In preparation for his term as President of Purdue University, Daniels stopped participating in partisan political activity during the 2012 election cycle and focused instead on issues related to higher education and fiscal matters.

Stating his desire to avoid the financial cost of a formal inauguration, Daniels instead wrote an &quot;Open Letter to the People of Purdue&quot; in which he documented the challenges facing higher education and outlined his initial priorities such as affordability, academic excellence and academic freedom. Daniels has continued this practice, opting to send Open Letters to the Purdue community instead of giving a formal State of the University speech, as is more common in higher education.

===Student interactions===
Daniels consistently argued that his top priority as president was students such as in 2020 when he said: &quot;We are only here, all of us, because of students, and to imagine that that is not our driving priority is a serious confusion...&quot;

Daniels worked out most days at the student gym and ate frequently with students in dining facilities and Greek houses. In March 2013, he joined forces with a group of engineering students to create a viral music video promoting engineering and Purdue University. Within 24 hours, the video had received over 50,000 views.

Purdue home football games featured a segment entitled &quot;Where&#x27;s Mitch?&quot;, in which, the stadium video board showed the camera panning the crowd and eventually finding Daniels sitting among the fans, sometimes in the student section. Former Purdue presidents rarely left their suite in the press-box structure. In April 2019, Daniels received a T-shirt gun for his birthday that he used to shoot t-shirts with his printed picture into the student section during home basketball games.

At the Spring 2021 Commencement, Daniels rode into the Purdue Football Stadium on a couch car designed by Purdue students that was often spotted on campus during that academic year.

===Purdue Polytechnic Indianapolis high school===
In 2015, Daniels announced plans to open the Purdue Polytechnic Indianapolis high school, designed to be a bridge for inner-city students to Purdue by admitting graduates directly to Purdue. Daniels described the high school as an attempt to increase the number of low-income, first-generation, and minority students who are prepared for Purdue.

Purdue now operates three such high schools but as of summer 2021, only one school had existed long enough to graduate a class of seniors. Of that class, forty students were admitted to Purdue for fall 2021, more than double the average of 15 who attend Purdue from Indianapolis Public Schools.

===Racial equity and handling of racist incidents===
Daniels has been criticized by student groups and faculty for his unwillingness to take stronger stances on public displays of white supremacy on campus. In November 2016, posters appeared on campus with drawings of white people with sayings such as &quot;We have a right to exist,&quot; and &quot;Defending your people is a social duty, not an anti-social crime.&quot; Daniels called the posters, left by a racist organization, a &quot;transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do&quot;. He also noted that the views of the organization behind the posters &quot;are obviously inconsistent with the values and principles we believe in here at Purdue.&quot; In January 2017, students staged a sit-in of Hovde Hall, where Daniels&#x27;s office is located. The occupation continued for 91 days. During that time, Daniels refused to meet the students.

In 2019, Daniels met with Purdue student government leaders to discuss a controversy surrounding a Purdue student who was unable to buy cold medicine when an off-campus CVS clerk did not accept his Puerto Rican driver&#x27;s license as valid. Following the scheduled meeting, Daniels had an impromptu 30-minute meeting with student activists who had various concerns about diversity at Purdue. At one point in the conversation, Daniels described his ongoing efforts to recruit an African American faculty member by calling the individual &quot;one of the rarest creatures in America—a leading, I mean a really leading, African-American scholar&quot;. The University Senate&#x27;s Equity and Diversity Committee issued a statement calling Daniels&#x27;s phrasing &quot;problematic&quot; stating, &quot;The idea that there is a scarcity of leading African American scholars is simply not true&quot;. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, G. Gabrielle Starr, president of Pomona College, wrote, &quot;In just a few sentences, Mr. Daniels seemed to question the possibility of sustained black excellence:. Following the criticism, Daniels issued an apology. &quot;I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students ... The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise&quot;.

In June 2020, as the Black Lives Matter movement gained national momentum, Daniels endorsed the creation of a university system-wide task force to examine racial inequality in response to the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of racial injustice. The task force resulted in the inclusion of racial equity as one of five goals in Purdue&#x27;s $260 million strategic plan update.
As of May 2021, Daniels had helped Purdue raise $27 million for minority scholarship and recruitment efforts in that year, an increase of about 15% over the previous year.

Each fall, Daniels sends a message to the entire campus stating that &quot;Racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry, and violence ... are the antithesis of [our] values and have no place on our campus.&quot; The message also states that the university will &quot;protect and promote the right to free and open inquiry&quot;. As president, Daniels has made the defense of free expression a priority by becoming the first public institution to adopt the Chicago principles for free speech and inquiry and one of roughly two dozen universities to receive the highest rating from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

===Tuition freezes and cost reductions===
Tuition at Purdue, prior to Daniels&#x27; arrival, had increased every year since 1976. Two months after Daniels assumed his role as president, Purdue announced it would freeze tuition for two years, eventually extending the freeze for ten years, through 2023. As a result, multiple graduating classes will leave Purdue having never experienced a tuition increase. Annual student borrowing is down a third and the Purdue loan default rate is 2.2% versus 7.1% for the average borrower from a four-year public university and 5.1% for Purdue borrowers prior to the tuition freeze. The university claims that students and families will have saved over a billion dollars over the course of the ten years. No student fees have been approved since the tuition freeze was enacted, although a mandatory student wellness fee that students lobbied for prior to Daniels&#x27; arrival at Purdue was allowed to take effect but was later reduced under Daniels&#x27; direction. The total cost of attending Purdue has fallen since Daniels assumed Purdue&#x27;s presidency. However, revenue per student increased modestly despite the freeze, partially because the number of foreign and out-of-state students increased, most significantly among graduate students.

Daniels announced the first tuition freeze before the state had determined Purdue&#x27;s funding for the next biennium. Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn&#x27;t need to wait because &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter what the General Assembly does. This is the right thing to do and we are going to do it&quot; The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves, and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.

Daniels also reduced meal plan rates for students by 10 percent, froze housing costs, and cut the university&#x27;s cooperative education fees which had previously increased every year. Due to the adjustments, the average cost of room and board at Purdue declined from the second most expensive to the most affordable in the Big Ten.

In fall 2014, Daniels announced a deal with Amazon to save students on textbooks and provide students, faculty and staff with free one day shipping to locations on campus. The partnership was ended by Amazon in 2018 but the on campus stores remain in place.

===Purdue Moves initiatives===
In September 2013, Daniels announced the first major priorities of his administration, known as &quot;Purdue Moves&quot;. The plan continued Daniels&#x27; focus on affordability but also called for new investments such as the hiring of 165 new faculty in STEM disciplines, expansion of flipped classrooms, growing summer enrollment, investments in plant science and drug discovery research, and the creation of competency-based degree programs and some three-year degree options. The Purdue Moves also emphasized commercialization of research. Under Daniels&#x27; leadership, Purdue increased the number of affiliated start-up companies by more than 400 percent and broke the university record for patents.

In 2021, Daniels announced an expansion of the original moves called &quot;Next Moves&quot;.

=== Response to COVID-19 ===
Daniels announced in April 2020 that Purdue intended to welcome students back on campus in the fall, becoming one of the earliest university leaders to do so, saying it would be an &quot;unacceptable breach of duty&quot; to not reopen. Daniels released a plan called Protect Purdue that was designed to protect the most vulnerable of Purdue&#x27;s campus from the disease by relying on masking, contact tracing, facility modifications, and a student pledge.

Some faculty objected to Daniels efforts to reopen while others worked with the administration, lending their expertise to craft the plan. In May 2020, while on CNN, Daniels dismissed the criticisms of a tenured engineering education professor, saying she represented a &quot;very tiny minority view&quot; ... &quot;Frankly, not from the most scientifically-credible corner of our very STEM-based campus&quot;. The American Society for Engineering Education responded to the remarks asking Daniels if he &quot;meant to cast doubt on the academic integrity of Dr. Pawley&quot;, &quot;cast doubt on the value of the School of Engineering Education, the first such department in the nation, recognized internationally&quot;, or &quot;to cast aspersions on the entire College of Engineering and its globally recognized research, innovative instruction, and respected faculty and alumni&quot;.

Throughout the 2020–21 academic year, Daniels and Purdue claimed that Purdue offered as much in-person instruction as any university its size. The university conducted 212,456 COVID tests and had 6,158 positive tests among employees and students with 99% having no worse than moderate symptoms but 14 being hospitalized.

=== Acquisition of Kaplan and launch of Purdue Global ===
In 2017, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees announced the intention to acquire Kaplan University for the purpose of transforming it into an online, self-sustaining, public benefit corporation, now rebranded as Purdue University Global. The acquisition has been met with both considerable praise and significant criticism. Among those who expressed favor before the deal closed included Barack Obama&#x27;s Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Ted Mitchell who led Obama&#x27;s crackdown on for-profit universities.

Among the critics of the acquisition were Purdue faculty. At the time, the Purdue University Senate called the deal a &quot;violation of common-sense educational practice&quot;. During the acquisition Purdue Faculty senate responded by established a Select Committee to provide oversight for the new entity. Shortly after the intended acquisition was announced, 319 signed a petition opposing the deal citing numerous concerns, including, &quot;Purdue University is not creating new access to higher education but merely becoming the owner of a preexisting corporation, with some danger to Purdue&#x27;s current reputation and operation&quot; and &quot;The business model of Kaplan University rests upon adult learners and is completely dependent on the federal loans that most are required to take to fund their educations.&quot;

In May 2017, the Purdue University Senate passed a resolution condemning the deal between Kaplan Higher Education and Purdue University. In September 2017, Senators Dick Durbin(D-IL) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) warned that Purdue&#x27;s acquisition of Kaplan University posed major risks for Purdue University&#x27;s students and reputation. They added that Kaplan has a &quot;shameful record&quot; as a &quot;predatory&quot; school. While leaders of the university senate have continued to object to the manner in which Purdue Global was acquired, the current chair of the senate has been quoted saying she is &quot;giving Purdue Global the benefit of the doubt&quot; and sees Global as an extension of Purdue&#x27;s land grant mission &quot;without spending $50 million building a new building to house students 10 years from now.&quot; The co-chair of the Select Committee on Global said in January 2020, &quot;it&#x27;s more a wait-and-see kind of thing&quot;.

The American Association of University Professors criticized PG&#x27;s (now former) arbitration requirement for students calling the policy &quot;the stuff of predatory for-profit colleges, not a leading public research institution&quot;. In September 2018, Senators Durbin and Brown called for Purdue to get rid of that policy, which came from the Kaplan rulebook. Robert Shireman, a former deputy undersecretary at the U.S. Department of Education, also criticized the move saying the colleges merely claimed nonprofit status while continuing to enrich Kaplan, Inc., company officials.

==== Purdue University Global ====
In 2019, Purdue Global had lost $61 million dollars from operations. In February 2020, Graham Holdings reported that Purdue University Global owed Kaplan, Inc. $68.4 million for services and deferred fees, and $18.6 million for an advance from the Kaplan University transaction.

In the first few years of operation, Purdue Global invested significantly in marketing, leading to significant financial losses. The details of the acquisition agreement meant Purdue Global was insulated from the losses, and even profited while the shortfalls were shifted to Kaplan, Inc. Financial results from 2021 show, Purdue Global&#x27;s operating revenues exceeded operating costs for the first time that year, however, from a cumulative perspective Purdue Global has accumulated $43 million in losses due to past years&#x27; performance. Purdue Global enrollment has grown since 2018 while other &quot;Global&quot; style campuses have remained flat or declined.

Critics have noted that if, or when, Purdue Global produces an operating profit that any operating gains from Purdue Global will be paid to Kaplan Higher Education until all losses are paid.

===Compensation===
When Daniels was hired by Purdue, he requested that his salary be less than his predecessor&#x27;s maximum salary and that 30 percent of his compensation be placed &quot;at-risk&quot; and only awarded if he reached performance metrics established by the trustees.

Under his first contract, Daniels&#x27; earned a guaranteed salary of $420,000 which was $135,000 less than the prior president&#x27;s salary. That year Daniels also earned another $113,000 for reaching 88% of the Trustees performance metrics meaning he was paid about $22,000 less than his predecessor.

Although Daniels&#x27; guaranteed base pay would never climb higher than $435,000, the amount available to be earned through performance metrics increased over the years and the trustees occasionally gave him a retention bonus that reached as high as $250,000 to try and keep him at Purdue. In Daniels final year at Purdue, he earned his guaranteed base of $430,000, plus another $210,700 for earning 98% of his at risk pay.

His total compensation over the years was $530,880 in 2014, $533,400 in 2015, $721,600 in 2016, $769,500 in 2017, $830,000 in 2018, $902,207 in 2019, $922,000 in 2020, $663,000 in 2021 and $640,700 in 2022.

=== End of Presidency ===
Daniels was replaced by Dr. Mung Chiang as President of Purdue University effective January 1, 2023.

As Daniels left Purdue, he openly explored a run for the U.S. Senate but ultimately declined, saying in a statement, &quot;it&#x27;s just not the job for me, not the town for me, and not the life I want to live at this point ... some people seek public office to be something, others to do something. My one tour of duty in elected office involved, like those in business before and academe after it, an action job, with at least the chance to do useful things every day. I have never imagined that I would be well-suited to legislative office, particularly where seniority remains a significant factor in one&#x27;s effectiveness, and I saw nothing in my recent explorations that altered that view.&quot;

One month after Daniels&#x27;s departure from Purdue, the university&#x27;s trustees named the business school the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business. The trustees had previously announced that State Street, a major campus corridor Daniels renovated, would be named Mitch Daniels Boulevard. That announcement was made at street festival in which hundreds waited to greet Daniels and bid him farewell.

==Board service==
In February 2013, Daniels was asked to co-chair a National Research Council committee to review and make recommendations on the future of the U.S. human spaceflight program. Daniels also co-chairs a Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on NonCommunicable diseases. In March 2013, Daniels was elected to the board of Energy Systems Network (ESN), Indiana&#x27;s industry-driven clean technology initiative.

In June 2015, Daniels was elected to serve on the board of directors for Indiana software company Interactive Intelligence (ININ) until its sale to Genesys. In July 2015, Daniels became a co-chair of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

In November 2016, Daniels was elected to serve on the board of directors for Norfolk Southern Corporation.

Daniels serves as a founding board member for National Resilience, a biotechnology company launched in November 2020.

In February, 2025, Daniels was named as a Board Member of Liberty Fund a private education foundation headquartered in Carmel, Indiana.

<text>Hines Edward Ward Jr. (born March 8, 1976) is an American football coach and former player who is the wide receivers coach for Arizona State. He played as a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) after being selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs.

Ward played his entire professional career for the Steelers and he became the team&#x27;s all-time leader in receptions, receiving yardage and touchdown receptions. Ward was voted MVP of Super Bowl XL and upon retirement was one of eleven NFL players to have at least 1,000 career receptions. Ward is often regarded as one of the best wide receivers of the 2000s, as well as one of key figures for the Steelers&#x27; success during the 2000s. Aside from his career in the NFL, Ward has appeared in various forms of film and television media, including the reality TV series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and brief cameos in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and in the television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. He was a studio analyst for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Night in America&quot; from 2012 to 2015. Ward joined CNN and HLN in May 2016. He was the player relations executive of the Alliance of American Football. In 2019, Ward began his coaching career as an offensive assistant for the New York Jets, working with wide receivers coach Shawn Jefferson. In 2021, Ward was hired by Florida Atlantic as special assistant to the head coach.

Born in Seoul, South Korea to a Korean mother and African-American father, Ward grew up in the Atlanta area. He has become an advocate for the social acceptance of foreigners in Korea, especially blended or mixed race youth.

==Early life==
Ward was born in Seoul, South Korea to a Korean mother, Kim Young-hee () and African-American father, Hines Ward, Sr. on March 8, 1976. His family moved to Atlanta and East Point, Georgia, when Hines Jr. was one year old and Hines Sr. went to West Germany to serve a tour of duty. The next year, Ward&#x27;s parents divorced, with Ward living with his mother and then with his paternal grandmother after Hines Sr. pleaded in family court that Kim could not easily raise Hines Jr. independently, as she did not speak English sufficiently. At the age of 7, Ward was reunited with his mother. For reasons not disclosed to the public, during this time, Ward Sr. did not support Ward with child support or visit him regularly. Ward has stated that he talks with his father about once every two years. Ward has stated that he has yet to reconcile with his father who left Hines Jr. when he was two years old. Under the guidance of coach Mike Parris at Forest Park High School in Forest Park, Georgia, Ward showcased his athletic skills as a quarterback and was two-time Clayton County Offensive Player of the Year. He also excelled in baseball and was selected by the Florida Marlins in the 73rd round (1,646th overall) of the 1994 MLB Draft.

==Playing career==
===College===
As a wide receiver for the University of Georgia Bulldogs (1994–1997), Ward&#x27;s 149 career receptions for 1,965 yards placed him second in team history. He also played tailback and totaled 3,870 all-purpose yards, second only to Herschel Walker in Bulldogs history. In 1995, Ward played some quarterback his sophomore year. He holds Georgia bowl game records for pass attempts, pass completions, and passing yards in the 1995 Peach Bowl in which he completed 31 of 59 passes for 413 yards.

When he came out of college, it was discovered that Ward was missing an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, which he lost during a bicycle accident during childhood. According to a Yahoo! Sports article, Ward broke his kneecap in the fourth grade and the doctors never accounted for the ligament.

===National Football League===

Coming out of the University of Georgia, Ward was regarded as one of the top five receivers in the 1998 NFL draft, along with Kevin Dyson and Randy Moss. He was projected to be selected at the end of the first round or beginning of the second. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts expressed major interest in him, visiting him multiple times to meet with him.

In 2005, Ward missed the first two weeks of training camp in a holdout for a contract extension that would increase his salary.

He was told they could work out an extension during the year and he&#x27;d be paid fairly.

Immediately following Super Bowl XL, Ward was videotaped for the &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Disney World!&quot; television commercial, adding &quot;...and I&#x27;m taking The Bus!&quot; Ward and Steelers teammate Jerome &quot;The Bus&quot; Bettis appeared in a victory parade at the Magic Kingdom theme park on February 6 along with Emmitt Smith.

During the season, he missed Weeks 13 and 14 and only finished his second season in a row with exactly 975 receiving yards. After the Steelers finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs, Head Coach Bill Cowher announced he was retiring.

====2007====
After eight years under Bill Cowher, Ward had the second coach of his career, as the Steelers organization hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin as their new head coach. This also marked his first season under offensive coordinator Bruce Arians, as Ken Whisenhunt left to become the Arizona Cardinals head coach. As the Steelers played the Bengals on October 28, 2007, Ward hauled in 8 passes for 88 yards and 2 touchdowns. On December 2, 2007, he caught a season-high 11 passes for 90 receiving yards and 2 touchdown receptions during the 24–10 victory over the Bengals. The 2 touchdowns against the Bengals made Ward the Steelers&#x27; all-time touchdown receptions leader with his 64th touchdown reception. Then on December 20, 2007, Ward became the Steelers&#x27; all-time receiving yardage leader in a game against the St. Louis Rams.

Ward finished the 2009 season with 95 receptions for 1,167 yards and six touchdowns as the Steelers finished 9–7.
====2010====

After the Steelers drafted Mike Wallace in 2009 and Emmanuel Sanders and Antonio Brown in 2010, Ward began to have a decline in his receptions. In the 2010 home opener against the Falcons, Ward had six receptions for 108 receiving yards as the Steelers won 15–9. In the game against the Atlanta Falcons, Ward became the first player in Steelers history to surpass 11,000 receiving yards. He caught 108 yards worth of passes in that game to pass Hall of Fame Steelers receiver John Stallworth for the most 100-yard receiving games all-time for the Steelers with his 26th.

On October 24, 2010, he had a season-high 131 receiving yards on seven receptions and scored a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins. In Week 14 against the Bengals, he hauled in a season-high eight passes for 115 yards. Ward&#x27;s streak of 186 consecutive games with at least one reception came to an end in a 39–26 loss against the New England Patriots in Week 10 of the 2010 season. A short catch by Ward was knocked loose when he was tackled by safeties Patrick Chung and James Sanders, and was knocked out of the rest of the game; the Patriots challenged the call, and the pass was ruled incomplete on review, ending the streak. On January 15, 2011, the Steelers faced the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional playoffs. Ward finished the contest with 3 receptions for 25 yards and a touchdown, as the Steelers won 31–24. The next week in the AFC Championship, he had 2 catches for 14 yards as the Steelers beat the New York Jets 24–19 to advance to Super Bowl XLV. On February 6, 2011, Ward appeared in his third Super Bowl with the Steelers against the Green Bay Packers. In his first career Super Bowl loss, he caught 7 passes for 78 receiving yards and a touchdown.

He finished the 2010 season with 59 receptions, 755 receiving yards, and five receiving touchdowns. He had not had a season below 60 catches since 2000.

====2011====

Ward began the 2011 NFL season, making 5 receptions for 67 yards in the Steelers&#x27; season opener against the Ravens. On October 9, 2011, he had 7 catches for 54 receiving yards and 2 touchdown receptions. In this game, he caught the last touchdown of his career on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger in the second quarter. On December 4, 2011, in a 35–7 home victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, Ward became the 19th player in NFL history to reach 12,000 receiving yards. On January 1, 2012, in a game against the Cleveland Browns, Ward caught his 1,000th reception, becoming the eighth player in NFL history to do so. He also caught his last career reception during the game. He appeared in his last game with the Steelers on January 8, 2012, as the Steelers lost 23–29 to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Wild Card Round. He finished his last season with a total of 46 receptions, 381 receiving yards, and two touchdowns in 15 games and nine starts.

On March 7, 2012, the Steelers announced their intention to cut and release Ward, which they did two days later.

On March 20, 2012, Ward announced his retirement from professional football stating, &quot;Without the support over the past 14 years this game wouldn&#x27;t be the same to me. It wouldn&#x27;t be as fun for me. You guys meant the world to me. The city and this organization means the world to me. So today as sadly as it feels for me right now, I hope it will be a good day for everyone here.&quot;

Ward accumulated 76 receptions, 1,064 yards, and eight receiving touchdowns in 14 post-season appearances.

Although the Steelers have not officially retired Ward&#x27;s #86, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again.

===Legacy===
Ward&#x27;s versatility, hands, and willingness to block served him well as a professional wide receiver. Since being drafted by the Steelers in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft, he earned three team Most Valuable Player (MVP) selections. He was also a four-time NFL Pro Bowl selection (2001–2004). Ward also had a streak of 4 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. The streak was broken in the 2005 NFL season during which he missed a game due to injury. In 2002, he set a Steelers franchise record for receptions (112) and touchdowns (12) (both since broken by Antonio Brown) and was named to his first of two consecutive All-NFL teams.

Although he was considered one of the best blocking receivers in the NFL, Ward often faced criticism for his style of blocking, particularly for his propensity to hit defenders on their blind side. During a game on October 19, 2008, Ward put a vicious downfield blindside block on rookie Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Keith Rivers. The impact of the block left Rivers with a broken jaw, and caused him to miss the remainder of the 2008 season. Ward was not penalized for this block, nor was he fined by the league as the hit was deemed legal. The league, however, later passed a new rule banning such hits. The so-called &quot;Hines Ward Rule&quot; made a blindside block illegal if the block came from the blocker&#x27;s helmet, forearm or shoulder and lands to the head or neck area of a defender. In a Sports Illustrated poll of NFL players in 2009, he was voted the &quot;dirtiest player in the NFL.&quot;

==Personal life==

Ward resides in Sandy Springs, Georgia, with his wife Lindsey Georgalas-Ward. They have one daughter. Ward also has a son from a previous relationship. On his upper right arm he has a tattoo of Mickey Mouse in the Heisman pose, just below a tattoo of his name in Korean.

===Business and media enterprises===
Ward co-owned a bar in Pittsburgh&#x27;s South Side called The Locker Room. The bar sustained serious water damage in February 2007, due to flooding from a malfunctioning boiler, and it was closed for repairs until June of that year. The bar received an insurance settlement of $500,000, which subsequently became an issue during a legal dispute between the bar&#x27;s owners.

On September 11, 2007, co-owner Nicholas Lettieri withdrew the entirety of the bar&#x27;s funds, approximately $19,000, from a corporate account, causing it to miss a large number of scheduled payments. The company filed suit for the return of the money, and Lettieri subsequently justified his actions by claiming that the money was owed to him, also voicing the belief that the other co-owners, Ward and Kimberly Pitts, as well as Pitts&#x27; husband, Korry Pitts, had falsified invoices and diverted company funds to their own bank accounts. Company attorney Thomas Castello dismissed Lettieri&#x27;s allegations as &quot;baseless, ridiculous and unfounded&quot;, and the matter currently is before the court. The Locker Room reopened under the name South Side 86 (because of Ward&#x27;s jersey number), and is owned entirely by Ward, who bought out his co-owners.

Ward hosted the &quot;Hines Ward Show&quot; on Pittsburgh CBS O&amp;O KDKA-TV from 2006 to 2012. In 2012, shortly after announcing his retirement, it was announced that Ward had signed on with NBC Sports to be a football analyst, highlighted by his role on the &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; pregame show &quot;Football Night in America&quot;.

He opened a restaurant called Table 86 and a wine bar named Vines in Seven Fields with Howard A Shiller from Fort Lauderdale in August 2015. The restaurant closed in March 2019 due to a lawsuit surrounding the partnership dispute for the businesses.

Ward joined CNN and HLN in May 2016. He is a current CNN studio analyst.

In 2018, he joined the Alliance of American Football as the Player Relations Executive.

===As a figure for social change===
In 2006, Ward became the first Korean American to win the Super Bowl MVP award. This achievement threw him into the spotlight of media in South Korea.

From April 3 through May 30, 2006, Ward returned to his birthplace of Seoul for the first time since his parents moved to the United States when he was one year old. Ward used his celebrity status to arrange &quot;hope-sharing&quot; meetings with multiracial Korean children and to encourage social and political reform. At one hope-sharing meeting, he told a group of children, &quot;If the country can accept me for who I am and accept me for being a Korean, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this country can change and accept you for who you are.&quot; On his final day in Korea, he donated US$1 million to create the Hines Ward Helping Hands Foundation, which the AP called &quot;a foundation to help mixed-race children like himself in South Korea, where they have suffered discrimination.&quot;

In September 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Ward as a member of the President&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

===DUI arrest===
On July 9, 2011, Ward was arrested for driving under the influence in DeKalb County, Georgia, after being witnessed by a MARTA police officer failing to maintain his lane and subsequently hitting a curb. An officer of the DeKalb County Police Department responded which led to the investigation and Ward&#x27;s arrest. On February 22, 2012, the DUI charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement. Ward agreed to plead guilty to reckless driving and received a sentence of one year of probation, 80 hours of community service and a $2,000 fine.

===Film and TV appearances===
Ward made an appearance as a member of the fictional Gotham Rogues football team in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, and was one of the members of &quot;Team Rachael&quot; in the second season of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. He appeared in the ninth episode of the third season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, appearing as a walker.

== Other sporting appearances ==

=== Dancing with the Stars performance ===
On May 24, 2011, Ward and his partner Kym Johnson won season 12 of the American TV dance competition &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

* In week 7, Donnie Burns was the guest judge and scored the dances as well (first score listed is Burns&#x27;).

===Triathlon===
In 2012, Ward began training for the 2013 Ironman World Championships, enlisting the help of triathlon legend Paula Newby-Fraser. On June 9, 2013, he competed in the Ironman Kansas 70.3. His finish time was 5:53:18, which earned him the overall rank of 623. On October 12, 2013, Ward completed the Ironman World Championships. He finished with a time of 13:08:15. Upon completion, he told Mike Florio at NBC that he will &quot;never&quot; compete in another triathlon and that he was &quot;one and done&quot;.

<doc id="1129657" wikidata="Q2465461" url="?curid=1129657" title="Default gateway">
<text>A default gateway is the node in a computer network using the Internet protocol suite that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.

==Role==
A gateway is a network node that serves as an access point to another network, often involving not only a change of addressing, but also a different networking technology. More narrowly defined, a router merely forwards packets between networks with different network prefixes. The networking software stack of each computer contains a routing table that specifies which interface is used for transmission and which router on the network is responsible for forwarding to a specific set of addresses. If none of these forwarding rules is appropriate for a given destination address, the default gateway is chosen as the router of last resort. The default gateway can be specified by the route command to configure the node&#x27;s routing table and default route.

In a home or small office environment, the default gateway is a device, such as a DSL router or cable router, that connects the local network to the Internet. It serves as the default gateway for all network devices.

Enterprise network systems may require many internal network segments. A device wishing to communicate with a host on the public Internet, for example, forwards the packet to the default gateway for its network segment. This router also has a default route configured to a device on an adjacent network, one hop closer to the public network.

==Examples==
===Single router===
The following example shows IP addresses that might be used with an office network that consists of six hosts plus a router. The six hosts addresses are:
* 192.168.4.3
* 192.168.4.4
* 192.168.4.5
* 192.168.4.6
* 192.168.4.7
* 192.168.4.8
The router&#x27;s inside address is:
* 192.168.4.1
The network has a subnet mask of:
* 255.255.255.0 (/24 in CIDR notation)

The address range assignable to hosts is from 192.168.4.1 to 192.168.4.254. TCP/IP defines the addresses 192.168.4.0 (network ID address) and 192.168.4.255 (broadcast IP address).

The office&#x27;s hosts send packets to addresses within this range directly, by resolving the destination IP address into a MAC address with the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) sequence and then encapsulates the IP packet into a MAC frame addressed to the destination host.

A packet addressed outside of this range, for this example, addressed to 192.168.12.3, cannot travel directly to the destination. Instead it must be sent to the default gateway for further routing to their ultimate destination. In this example, the default gateway uses the IP address 192.168.4.1, which is resolved into a MAC address with ARP in the usual way. The destination IP address remains 192.168.12.3, but the next-hop MAC address is that of the gateway, rather than of the ultimate destination.

===Multi-router===
In another example, a network with three routers and three hosts is connected to the Internet through Router1. The hosts&#x27; addresses are:
* PC1 10.1.1.100, default gateway 10.1.1.1
* PC2 172.16.1.100, default gateway 172.16.1.1
* PC3 192.168.1.100, default gateway 192.168.1.96

Router1:
* Interface 1 5.5.5.2 (public IP)
* Interface 2 10.1.1.1

Router2:
* Interface 1 10.1.1.2
* Interface 2 172.16.1.1

Router3:
* Interface 1 10.1.1.3
* Interface 2 192.168.1.96

Network mask in all networks: 255.255.255.0 (/24 in CIDR notation). If the routers do not use a routing protocol to discover which network each router is connected to, then the routing table of each router must be set up.

Router1
Router2
Router3
Router2 manages its attached networks and default gateway; router 3 does the same; router 1 manages all routes within the internal networks.

; Accessing internal resources
: If PC2 (172.16.1.100) needs to access PC3 (192.168.1.100), since PC2 has no route to 192.168.1.100 it will send packets for PC3 to its default gateway (router2). Router2 also has no route to PC3, and it will forward the packets to its default gateway (router1). Router1 has a route for this network (192.168.1.0/24) so router1 will forward the packets to router3, which will deliver the packets to PC3; reply packets will follow the reverse path back to PC2.
; Accessing external resources
: If any of the computers try to access a webpage on the Internet, like https://en.wikipedia.org/, the destination will first be resolved to an IP address by using DNS-resolving. The IP-address could be 91.198.174.2. In this example, none of the internal routers know the route to that host, so they will forward the packet through router1&#x27;s gateway or default route. Every router on the packet&#x27;s way to the destination will check whether the packet&#x27;s destination IP-address matches any known network routes. If a router finds a match, it will forward the packet through that route; if not, it will send the packet to its own default gateway. Each router encountered on the way will store the packet ID and where it came from so that it can pass the response packet back to the sender. The packet contains source and destination, not all router hops. At last the packet will arrive back to router1, which will check for matching packet ID and route it accordingly through router2 or router3 or directly to PC1 (which was connected in the same network segment as router1).
; The packet doesn&#x27;t return
: If router1 routing table does not have any route to 192.168.1.0/24, and PC3 tries to access a resource outside its own network, then the outgoing routing will work until the reply is fed back to router1. Since the route is unknown to router1, it will go to router1&#x27;s default gateway, and never reach router3. In the logs of the resource they will trace the request, but the requestor will never get any information. The packet will die because the TTL-value decreased to less than 1 when it was traveling through the routers, or the router will see that it has a private IP and discard it. This could be discovered by using the Microsoft Windows utility PathPing or MTR on Unix-like operating systems, since the ping will stop at the router which has no route or a wrong route. (Note that some routers will not reply to pinging).

== Utilities ==
Various utility software can show the default gateway. On Windows, codice_1 may be used, while on Unix systems, codice_2 or codice_3 may be used. On Linux codice_4 has been superseded by codice_5.

<text>Walden &quot;Wally&quot; O&#x27;Dell is the former chief executive officer and former chairman of the board of Diebold, a US-based security and financial products company.

He was an active fundraiser for George W. Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign and wrote in a fund-raising letter dated August 13, 2003, that he was committed &quot;to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President.&quot; His involvement with the campaign raised concerns that, as the CEO of the largest manufacturer of electronic voting equipment, he would have been in a position to attempt to manipulate the results of the presidential election of 2004.

In December 2005, O&#x27;Dell left the company amid a United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into insider trading at the company.

O&#x27;Dell holds both a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Saint Louis University, and an M.B.A. from Stanford University. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of Ohio State University.

<doc id="1129675" wikidata="Q325664" url="?curid=1129675" title="Andrew J. Offutt">
<text>Andrew Jefferson Offutt V (August 16, 1934 – April 30, 2013) was an American science fiction, fantasy, and erotic fiction author. He wrote as Andrew J. Offutt, A. J. Offutt, and Andy Offutt. His normal byline, andrew j. offutt, has all his name in lower-case letters. His erotica appeared under seventeen different pseudonyms, principally John Cleve, John Denis, Jeff Morehead, and Turk Winter.

&quot;The Sword of Skelos&quot; (1979), one of Offutt&#x27;s contributions to the Conan The Barbarian saga, included a short, facetious biographical note: &quot;Andrew J. Offutt is the recently &#x27;tired and re-tired&#x27;, as he puts it, president of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He loves heroic fantasy though at 6&#x27; 1&quot; he is built for speed, not combat. Kentuckian Offutt has a number of other books in and out of print, and has been a helpless fan of Robert E. Howard since birth. Now he calls himself the Steve Garvey among writers; &#x27;Surely it&#x27;s every boy&#x27;s dream to grow up—but not too much—and get to write about Conan&#x27;. Offutt researches with gusto, both in and out of books, having—briefly and painfully, he says—worn chainmail and helm and wielded sword. He is also tired of aged, bald, ugly, sexless mages and squeaky females in heroic fantasy&quot;.

==Life and family==
Offutt was born in a log cabin near Taylorsville, Kentucky. He was married for more than 50 years to Jodie McCabe Offutt of Lexington, Kentucky. They had four children: writer Chris Offutt; Jeff Offutt, Professor of Software Engineering at George Mason University; Scotty Hyde, copy editor for the &quot;Park City Daily News&quot; in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Melissa Offutt, a sales executive for Sprint in San Diego. Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.

==Career in speculative fiction==

Offutt began publishing in 1954 with the story &quot;And Gone Tomorrow&quot; in the &quot;If&quot;. Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story &quot;Blacksword&quot; to &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was &quot;Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards&quot; in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it &quot;embarrassingly amateur&quot;.

Offutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the &quot;Thieves World&quot; series edited by Robert Asprin and Lynn Abbey, which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as Shadowspawn (and, later, Chance). His &quot;Iron Lords&quot; series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by Robert E. Howard. There was a series on Howard&#x27;s best known character, Conan, and another one on the less known Cormac mac Art—an Irish Viking active in King Arthur&#x27;s time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.

As &quot;John Cleve&quot;, Offutt also wrote the 19-book erotic science fiction series &quot;Spaceways&quot;, over half of which were collaborations.

As an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled &quot;Swords Against Darkness&quot;, which included the first professional sale by Charles de Lint. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA).

==Career in erotica==
Offutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, &quot;Anonymous,&quot; Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux, John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winter, and Jeff Woodson. The first was &quot;Bondage Babes&quot;, published under the name Alan Marshall by Greenleaf in 1968; the first appearance of his principal pen name, John Cleve, was on &quot;Slave of the Sudan&quot; in 1969.

According to his son Chris Offutt he came to regard Cleve as more a separate persona than a pen name, and his other aliases as Cleve&#x27;s pen names, not his own. As &quot;Cleve&quot; he published more than 130 works of erotica before the market for erotica dried up about 1985; afterwards, turning to self-publishing, he issued 260 more as Turk Winter (an early &quot;Cleve&quot; pen name) over the next twenty-five years. Thirty more remained unpublished at the time of his death. So prolific was Offutt in this area that in summing up his writing career his son Chris wrote that he &quot;came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer.&quot;

<text>Ferdinand Julius Cohn (24 January 1828 – 25 June 1898) was a German biologist. He is one of the founders of modern bacteriology and microbiology.

==Biography==
Ferdinand Julius Cohn was born in the Jewish quarter of Breslau in the Prussian Province of Silesia (modern-day Wrocław, Poland). His father, Issak Cohn, was a successful merchant and manufacturer who for some time held the post of Austro-Hungarian consul. He was the elder brother of humorist and playwright Oskar Justinus Cohn and of historian and jurist .

He was considered a child prodigy, and could read at the age of two. He also suffered hearing impairment from a young age. He entered the in 1835 at the age or 6 or 7, and the University of Breslau in 1842 or 1844. There he studied botany under Heinrich Göppert and Christian Nees von Esenbeck. 

Cohn was refused admission to the University of Breslau&#x27;s doctoral program because of his Jewish background. He thus continued his studies at the University of Berlin, where he obtained a Ph.D. in 1847 with a dissertation on the physiology of seeds. In it he advocated for the establishment of botanical gardens dedicated to the study of plant physiology, a vision that he later played a significant role in realizing. 

He returned to Breslau in 1848 and, after a delay due to his Jewish heritage, was appointed as a privat-docent in 1850. He remained at that university for the rest of his career, obtaining the titled of professor in 1857 and, following the death of his mentor Göppert, was promoted to a full professorship in 1872.

==Work==
Cohn was a prolific writer, leaving behind over 150 papers, essays, and books.

In the 1850s he studied the growth and division of plant cells. In 1855 he produced papers on the sexuality of &quot;Sphaeroplea annulina&quot; and later &quot;Volvox globator&quot;. In the 1860s he studied plant physiology in several different aspects. From 1870 onward he mostly studied bacteria. He established the use of sterile culture mediums and rediscovered the botanical garden of Lorenz Scholz von Rosenau in Breslau.

Cohn was the first to classify algae as plants, and to define what distinguishes them from green plants. His classification of bacteria into four groups based on shape (sphericals, short rods, threads, and spirals) is still in use today. Among other things Cohn is remembered for being the first to show that &quot;Bacillus&quot; can change from a vegetative state to an endospore state when subjected to an environment deleterious to the vegetative state.

==Awards==
Cohn was elected a member of numerous institutions and societies, including the Leopold Carolinische Akademie, Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin, Société de biologie de France, the Royal Microscopic Society of Great Britain, and the Natural History Society of Boston, among others.

He received the Leeuwenhoek Medal in 1885, and the Linnean Medal in 1895. For his efforts leading to the establishment of the Botanical Institute in Breslau in 1888, he received the title of &quot;Geheimer Regierungsrat&quot;. On the occasion of his seventieth birthday he was presented with the honorary freedom of the city of Breslau.

He has previously served as the national team director of the German Football Association. A tall, strong and prolific goalscorer, Bierhoff was mostly renowned for his excellent abilities in the air, and as a target man, being able to deliver pin-point headers towards goal.

He spent his early career playing for Bayer Uerdingen, Hamburger SV and Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga where he had modest success. After a season in the Austria Bundesliga for Austria Salzburg, he was signed by Ascoli in Serie A. Ascoli were relegated in his first season and Bierhoff played three seasons with them in the Serie B.

Bierhoff was signed by an Udinese team led by Alberto Zaccheroni in 1995 where he had great success and earned his first call-up to the Germany national team. Bierhoff scored the first golden goal in the history of major international football, for Germany in the Euro 96 final, a career-defining performance that vaulted him into the international limelight.

He finished the 1997–98 season as Serie A top scorer. He was subsequently signed by AC Milan in 1998, winning the Serie A title in his first season with the club, scoring 19 goals in the league and 21 in all competitions. He set a Serie A record for most headed goals in a single season, with 15. After three years at AC Milan, Bierhoff had brief stints at Monaco and Chievo before retiring from playing in 2003.

==Club career==
The son of a German utility magnate, Bierhoff played for nine different clubs, in four different countries. He scored a total of 102 goals in Serie A, one of the highest totals for a non-Italian in the league&#x27;s history. In the 1997–98 season, he was the Serie A top scorer with 27 goals for Udinese.

Bierhoff, however, was never a success in the Bundesliga. After failing to shine in Germany, he got his chance in the Austrian Bundesliga. That gave him the chance at Ascoli in Italy. But it was at Udinese, under Alberto Zaccheroni, that Bierhoff found success and won his place in fame and in the Germany national team. He then transferred to AC Milan in 1998, winning the Serie A title in his first season with the club, scoring 19 goals in the league and 21 in all competitions, including the match-winning goal in the final, title-deciding match of the season, a 2–1 away win over Perugia. During the 1998–99 season, he set a Serie A record for most headed goals in a single season, with 15. After three seasons there, he moved to Ligue 1 side Monaco in 2001 for one year, before moving back to Serie A to play for ChievoVerona, where he retired at the end of the 2002–03 season. In his last game, he scored a hat-trick for Chievo in a 3–4 defeat to Juventus.

==International career==

Bierhoff debuted for the Germany national team in a friendly against Portugal on 21 February 1996. In his second appearance on 27 March 1996, he scored his first two international goals in his country&#x27;s 2–0 win over Denmark. Bierhoff was not initially going to be selected by coach Berti Vogts for Germany&#x27;s UEFA Euro 1996, but Vogts&#x27;s wife convinced him to take Bierhoff, saying, &quot;he&#x27;ll repay you.&quot; Bierhoff would come on as a substitute in the final against the Czech Republic with Germany 1-0 down, and scored both the equaliser and the golden goal in extra time to win the tournament.

In an important qualification match on 20 August 1997, Germany trailed Northern Ireland, 0–1, with 20 minutes left when the manager of the national team, Berti Vogts, sent in Thomas Häßler and Oliver Bierhoff. Within seven minutes the former provided Bierhoff with three assists, meaning Bierhoff had scored the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Germany national team.
In 1998, he was appointed captain of the national team after the retirement of Jürgen Klinsmann.

Bierhoff also played in Euro 2000, and both the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups. In Germany&#x27;s opening match of the 2002 tournament at the Sapporo Dome on 1 June, he scored in an 8–0 win over Saudi Arabia. He made his last appearance for his country on 30 June, when he was brought on during the second half of the 2002 FIFA World Cup final against Brazil, but was unable to help the Germans score in the 0–2 loss.

==Style of play==
A large and prolific striker, Bierhoff was a strong, physical, aggressive, and powerful player, who played mainly as a target man in the centre-forward role. Although he was not particularly skilful with his feet from a technical standpoint, or a particularly good ball-player, he possessed good movement inside the box as well as strong hold-up play, but he was known in particular for his excellent aerial ability; in addition to his height, strength, and elevation, he was able to execute headers with power and precision, having scored several critical goals with his head throughout his career, for both club and country, which led him to be regarded as one of the best players in the world with his head and as a specialist in the air. In addition to scoring goals, Bierhoff was also capable of providing assists to his teammates with his head through knock-downs. Although he was less adept at scoring with his feet, he also possessed a powerful shot.

==Managerial career==
Bierhoff was a manager of the Germany national football team from 2004 until December 2017, a new position created as part of Jürgen Klinsmann&#x27;s acceptance of the coaching job. Essentially the duties revolve around the public relations aspect of the team as opposed to coaching responsibilities. On 1 January 2018, a structural reform in the German Football Association took place and Bierhoff was named the technical director of the Germany national team (officially &quot;Direktor Nationalmannschaften und Akademie&quot;, &quot;director national teams and football development&quot;). After another early World Cup exit in 2022, Bierhoff had his contract terminated by the DFB, which was supposed to run until 2024.

==Personal life==
Bierhoff married Klara Szalantzy on 22 June 2001, Szalantzy was a model of Hungarian ancestry from Munich and former girlfriend of basketball player Dražen Petrović. She was behind the wheel in the fatal car crash that claimed Petrović&#x27;s life. Bierhoff and his wife had a daughter on 27 January 2007. He is a Roman Catholic.

Bierhoff features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he features in the &quot;FIFA 14&quot; Ultimate-Team Legends.

He is a member of the AC Milan Hall of Fame.

Bierhoff was one of several celebrities in 2015 who endorsed the tabloid newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;″s petition against anti-Islamisation group PEGIDA.

===Education===
Bierhoff took a correspondence course and graduated in 2002 with a degree in business economics from the University of Hagen.

<doc id="1129691" wikidata="Q641691" url="?curid=1129691" title="League of Communists of Yugoslavia">
<text>The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, known until 1952 as the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, was the founding and ruling party of SFR Yugoslavia. It was formed in 1919 as the main communist opposition party in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and after its initial successes in the elections, it was proscribed by the royal government and was at times harshly and violently suppressed. It remained an illegal underground group until World War II when, after the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, the military arm of the party, the Yugoslav Partisans, became embroiled in a bloody civil war and defeated the Axis powers and their local auxiliaries. After the liberation from foreign occupation in 1945, the party consolidated its power and established a one-party state, which existed in that form of government until 1990, a year prior to the start of the Yugoslav Wars and breakup of Yugoslavia.

The party, which was led by Josip Broz Tito from 1937 to 1980, was the first communist party in power in the history of the Eastern Bloc that openly opposed the Soviet Union and thus was expelled from the Cominform in 1948 in what is known as the Tito–Stalin split. After internal purges of pro-Soviet members, the party renamed itself the League of Communists in 1952 and adopted the politics of workers&#x27; self-management and an independent path to achieving socialism, known as Titoism.

==Opposition party==
===Establishment===



The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia) was established in late 1918 at the end of the World War I. Socialist movement in the territory of the new state reflected political divisions existing before the war. For example, in what was then Austria-Hungary, the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia (SDPCS) came into existence in 1894, two years before the Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party (, JSDS) was set up in Slovene lands. The Serbian Social Democratic Party (SSDP) was founded in 1903. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDPBH) was established in 1909.

The SSDP deemed it natural to serve, as the largest social-democratic party in the new state, to unify like-minded political groups in the country. The SDPBH formally proposed a merger of such parties, but the SDPCS, the JSDS, and Serbian–Bunjevac social-democrats from Vojvodina declined. In turn, only the SSDP and the SDPBH formally agreed to a merger by January 1919. A minority group on the left wing of the SDPCS split from the party as the Action Committee of the Left () and opted for the unified social-democratic party with the SSDP and the SDPBH. Soon afterwards, the Vojvodina social-democrats reversed their decision. The Unification congress of the Socialist Labor Party of Yugoslavia (Communists) (, SRPJ(k)) was held in Belgrade on 20–23 April 1919 as consolidation on the left of the political spectrum. The new party was joined by the SSDP en masse, and by independent leftists who splintered away from various nationalist youth organisations and social democratic parties. The Labour Socialist Party of Slovenia () split from the JSDS and joined the SRPJ(k) on 13 April 1920.

Clashes continued within the party between leftists and centrists – the latter favouring pursuit of reforms through a parliamentary system. The leftist faction prevailed at the second congress held in Vukovar on 20–24 June 1920 and adopted a new statute. That aligned the party entirely with the Communist International (Comintern), implementing all instructions received from the Comintern. Furthermore, the party was renamed the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (, KPJ) to allow its membership in the Comintern. Filip Filipović and Sima Marković, both former SSDP activists, were elected to lead the KPJ. By May 1920, the KPJ had about 50,000 members, and numerous sympathisers largely drawn from among 300,000 members of trade unions and youth organisations.

===1920 elections and ban===
In the 1920 Constitutional Assembly election, the KPJ won 58 out of 419 seats. The best results were achieved in large cities, in Montenegro and Macedonia as a result of protest votes against the regime on account of past or expected actions coming from unemployed urban voters and from voters in regions having no other attractive national or regional opposition parties found in the Slovene lands, Croatia-Slavonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In light of difficult economic and social circumstances, the regime viewed the KPJ as the main threat to the system of government. In response to the KPJ&#x27;s electoral success at the local and regional level including Belgrade and Zagreb earlier that year in March–August, and at the national level the Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s Radical Party advocated prohibition of communist activity. The regime saw the KPJ as the greatest impediment to realisation of views held by King Peter I on resolution of Serbian national question.

In December 1920, KPJ-led miner strikes in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina led to suppression by the royal army and restrictions on communist propaganda. The violence served as a pretext for prosecution of the KPJ. On 30 December, the government issued &quot;Obznana&quot;, a decree outlawing the KPJ. A faction of the KPJ named Red Justice () attempted to assassinate the Regent Alexander on 28 June, and then killed former Interior Minister Milorad Drašković on 21 July. This led to proclamation of the Law on the Protection of the Realm turning the KPJ ban into legislation on 2 August, annulment of the KPJ seats in the national assembly two days later, and numerous covert police agents infiltrating the KPJ.

===Move abroad and underground===
Despite the electoral success, the ban and KPJ&#x27;s consequent move to covert operation took a heavy toll on the party in the next decade and a half when, faced with factional struggle, it would increasingly look to the Comintern for guidance. By 1924, the KPJ membership was reduced to 688. Additionally, some members emigrated abroad – most to Moscow, but also to Vienna, Prague, and Paris. Indeed, the KPJ held a land conference in Vienna in 1922, where the party leadership moved the year before.

In the early 1920s, KPJ saw more factional struggle between its right wing led by Marković and Belgrade-based trade union leaders Lazar Stefanović and Života Milojković advocating work through legal means to regain government approval, and leftists, including Đuro Cvijić, Vladimir Ćopić, Triša Kaclerović, Rajko Jovanović, and Kosta Novaković, favouring Leninist undercover struggle. The leftists also supported a federalisation of the state, while the others pushed for limited regional autonomy only.

The leftists prevailed at the January 1924 Third Land Conference held covertly in Belgrade where the KPJ proclaimed the right of each nation to secede and form its national state. In June, the Comintern instructed the KPJ that self-determination should take shape of independent Slovenian, Croatian, and Macedonian republics. The stance taken by the Cominform was influenced by Moscow visit by Stjepan Radić, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (, HSS) when Radić added the HSS to the Peasant International (Krestintern) – itself an agency of the Cominform.

Furthermore, the Comintern criticised the factional clashes in the KPJ over the national question in its 1924 Resolution of National Question which linked social emancipation to national one in strategic considerations. In response, Milojković was expelled, but Marković remained a part of KPJ leadership. This changed in 1925 when he was denounced by the leader of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin personally before Yugoslav commission of the Comintern insisting that the KPJ must harness national movements for revolutionary aims. Regardless, the factional struggle continued. In 1927, the seat of the KPJ central committee in Yugoslavia was moved from Belgrade to Zagreb.

===Leftists prevail===
In February 1928, Josip Broz Tito and Andrija Hebrang, seeking to stir the existing situation into resolution of the conflict, persuaded the delegates to conference of the Zagreb KPJ organisation to adopt a resolution seeking the Comintern to intervene and end the factional struggle in the KPJ entirely. The KPJ also led some of street protests in Croatia over assassination of Radić later that year. The Comintern Sixth World Congress held that year sought to increase revolutionary struggle and the strategy was accepted by the KPJ at its Fourth Congress held in Dresden in October 1928. The appeal made at the initiative of Tito and Hebrang was accepted: Marković was expelled and his allies demoted, while new leadership was installed. Tito and Hebrang were bypassed because they were just imprisoned in Yugoslavia, and Đuro Salaj, Žika Pecarski, and Đuro Đaković were appointed instead as entirely Comintern-trained leadership.
In 1929, the new KPJ leadership put the Comintern&#x27;s call to violence into practice, but instead of all-out revolt, the efforts were consisted of leaflets and several shoot-outs with the police. KPJ losses were heavy and included death of several significant leaders including Đaković and imprisonment of its most active members by specially convened antisubversive tribunals. In turn, the Sremska Mitrovica Prison became a makeshift KPJ training school as the prison allowed grouping of political prisoners.

On instructions from the Comintern, non-Serb members of the KPJ were to advocate breakup of Yugoslavia as a construct of the Western Powers. However at the time, most of their efforts were invested in struggle against the JSDS and debating revolutionary merits of literature written by Miroslav Krleža. By 1932, membership dwindled to less than 500, the KPJ maintained its leadership divided in at least two locations at all times in 1928–1935, including at least one abroad in Moscow, Prague, Vienna, or Paris.

Also acting on Comintern July 1932 instructions to promote and aid national revolt in Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Macedonia, the KPJ sought to establish ties with the Bulgaria-based Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, but the organisation was suffering from its internal weaknesses and suppressed by 1934. There were also overtures towards Italian-based Ustaše as a Croatian secessionist organisation. KPJ leaders praised the Ustaše-initiated Lika uprising in 1932, hoping to steer Ustaše to the political left. Even though support for Ustaše efforts in Lika and Dalmatia was declared through &quot;Proleter&quot; newspapers in December 1932, the bulk of contact with them was limited to contact with fellow prison inmates trying to engage them over the shared goal of breakup of Yugoslavia.

===Gorkić and turn to popular front===
The &quot;ultra-leftist&quot; line pursued since 1928 was abandoned in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Instead, the KPJ turned the idea of forming a popular front together with other anti-fascist organisations. The strategy aimed to attract broad coalition of allies since it was no longer thought feasible to achieve quick introduction of communist rule. The popular front strategy coincided with assignment of Milan Gorkić to the KPJ leadership from his posting at the Comintern in 1932. Gorkić set about to introduce discipline to the KPJ top ranks and establish ties with the JSDS, the HSS, the Montenegrin Federalist Party, the Slovene Christian Socialists, and pro-Russian right wing organisations in Serbia with Moscow now advocating Yugoslav unity. This placed the KPJ at odds with the Comintern which continued to advocate breakup of Yugoslavia until signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Still, Gorkić largely stayed out of Yugoslavia. In 1934, he appointed Tito, just released from jail, to organise secret KPJ congress in Ljubljana later that year. Gorkić was appointed the general secretary of the KPJ in 1936, with Sreten Žujović and Rodoljub Čolaković as central committee members. Tito was appointed by the Comintern as the organisational secretary of the KPJ in Moscow in September of the same year and he moved to Vienna a month later.

In July 1937, Gorkić was summoned from his Paris base to Moscow where he was arrested. In addition to him, there were about 900 communists of Yugoslav origin or their supporters in the Soviet Union who fell victim to the Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge as did 50 other KPJ officials posted in Moscow including Cvijić, Ćopić, Filipović, Marković, and Novaković. The Soviet subsidy to the KPJ was suspended. The move left Tito in de facto control of the KPJ as his position was ranked second only to the one held by Gorkić.

===Tito assumes power===

Tito spent 1937 and early 1938 in Yugoslavia organising the KPJ there as a disciplined covert organisation drawing new members loyal to the communist ideas and Tito personally from all nations within Yugoslavia, except Macedonians. During this period, Tito intervened in conflict among groups of KPJ members incarcerated in Sremska Mitrovica. The conflict centred on the popular front strategy advocated by Hebrang and supported by Moša Pijade, Josip Kraš, and Đuro Pucar and denounced by Petko Miletić backed by Milovan Đilas and Aleksandar Ranković – the latter labelled Wahhabites by Pijade because of their radicalism. The conflict escalated to an attempt to kill Hebrang. Tito worked with Pijade to arrange a compromise by including Đilas and Ranković in the temporary KPJ leadership along with Croatian moderate popular front supporters Kraš and Andrija Žaja as well as Soviet-educated Slovene Edvard Kardelj.

In 1937, the Comintern compelled the KPJ to formally establish the Communist Party of Croatia (, KPH) and the Communist Party of Slovenia (). The two parties were nominally independent, but actually within the KPJ. This was later the precedent for establishment of communist parties in other parts of Yugoslavia. Still the KPH leadership headed by Kraš and Žaja came into conflict with Tito in 1938 when the KPH supported the HSS instead of the Party of the Working People as the KPJ front founded for participation in 1938 parliamentary elections.

The temporary leadership put together by Tito remained largely unchanged when Tito received the Comintern mandate to lead the KPJ in 1939. Miletić was released from prison that year and sought to replace Tito. Months later he disappeared after he was summoned to Moscow and arrested by the NKVD as a victim of a series of purges in the KPJ in 1937–1940 which strengthened Tito&#x27;s position.

In 1940, the KPJ successfully completed the campaign to diminish influence of Krleža and his literary adherents who were advocating Marxist ideas and opposed Stalinisation fearing totalitarianism. Also, Tito removed Kraš and Žaja from the leading positions in the KPH and replaced them by Rade Končar.

In October 1940, the Fifth Land Conference of the KPJ was held covertly in Zagreb, as the final act of Tito&#x27;s campaign to assume full control of the party. The conference represented a full takeover of now organisationally stronger, centralized, disciplined, and bolshevized, but politically isolated KPJ by Tito in full alignment with the leftist line pursued by the Comintern at the time. The national question was placed at the centre of the KPJ policy at the conference where Tito criticised long gone Marković and Gorkić for lack of understanding of the issue. As Tito consolidated his control, the KPJ membership grew to 6,000 in 1939 and to 8,000 by 1941, with many more other supporters.

The final months of 1940 were marked by militarisation of politics in Yugoslavia leading to incidents such as the armed clash between the KPJ and the far-right Yugoslav National Movement in October leaving five dead and 120 wounded. The structural changes of the KPJ, strategic use of the national question and social emancipation to mobilise supporters made the party ideologically and operationally ready for armed resistance in the approaching war.

==Armed resistance==

===Setting up the Partisan force===

During brief resistance of the Royal Yugoslav Army against the Axis invasion of the country, Tito was in Zagreb. Two days after outbreak of hostilities, the KPJ and the KPH requested arms from the 4th Army headquarters to help defend the city, but they were denied. With the Yugoslav defeat imminent, the KPJ instructed its 8,000 members to stockpile weapons in anticipation of armed resistance, which would spread, by the end of 1941 to all areas of the country except Macedonia.

Building on its experience in clandestine operation across the country, the KPJ proceeded to organise the Yugoslav Partisans, as resistance fighters led by Tito. The KPJ assessed that the German invasion of the Soviet Union had created favourable conditions for an uprising and its politburo founded the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia () with Tito as commander in chief on 27 June 1941.

In terms of military training, the Partisans relied on those among its ranks who had completed the mandatory national service in the Royal Yugoslav Army or fought in the Spanish Civil War. Many KPJ members were veterans of that conflict, and would go on to assume commanding positions in the Partisan ranks. In addition to military training, political training was given increasing importance as the war progressed. It was provided by political commissars based on the Soviet model. The commissaries were a part of the detachment staff, units originally ranging in size from 50 to 500 or even 1,000. A commissar&#x27;s cap badge was made distinct from other Partisans. Namely, the red star on their cap was defaced with the hammer and sickle. The move drew criticism from the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation (, OF) civil resistance organisation – which accused the KPJ of creating its own army. In response, Slovene Partisan commissars&#x27; caps were adorned with red stars defaced with letters &quot;OF&quot; instead. By 1942, typically 30–50 percent of Partisan unit personnel declared themselves as communists. Selection of personnel deemed the best for 14 Proletarian Brigades increased this share in those units – to more than 60 percent in some instances. According to Yugoslav sources, the Partisan forces grew to 800,000 by 1945 through volunteers, conscription of men aged 17–50, and defections of enemy troops promised amnesty.

===Leftist errors===

KPJ&#x27;s strategic approach was complex because of pressures from the Comintern prioritising social struggle competing with the national liberation in substantially regionally uneven circumstances resulting from Axis partitioning of Yugoslavia, especially from creation of Axis-satellite of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH).

In Macedonia, the regional organisation led by Metodi Shatorov switched allegiance from the KPJ to the Bulgarian Communist Party, practically recognising Bulgarian annexation of the area. Collapse of Užice Republic, a Partisan-controlled territory in occupied Serbia in 1941 during a German and Chetnik offensive was, in part, helped by views of local peasants who viewed Chetnik propaganda more favourably than communist social radicalism in light of preservation of their property.

Following the German defeat at Moscow in late 1941, the KPJ leadership thought that the war was nearly over and went to ensure full control by the KPJ in the country. In the period until spring of 1942, this policy was generally confined to Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina, and in a lesser draconian form to the area of present-day Vojvodina and Slovenia. It largely consisted of killing of class enemies where individual Partisan units were given quotas of required executions. It also meant forced labour for peasants deemed idle or even untidy. The targeted populations were driven to support Chetniks or other Axis forces, and the policy thus undermined the overall struggle – in turn causing the KPJ to criticise the perpetrators ignoring the role of its Central Committee in formulation of the policy. Similarly, the KPJ penalised Petar Drapšin and Miro Popara as proponents of the policy, but ignored similar roles played by Đilas, Ivan Milutinović, and Boris Kidrič. In spring of 1942, the policy known as the Leftist errors was abandoned.

===Conflict of policy in Croatia===
Policies employed by the NDH, enforced by the Ustaše against Serbs and ceding of Dalmatia to Italy through the Treaties of Rome created a natural base for Partisan recruitment among the Serbs, and Croats (particularly in Dalmatia) respectively. Furthermore, establishment of the NDH fractured the HSS into three groups – one supporting the armed resistance, another supporting the NDH, and an indecisive group around HSS leader Vladko Maček employing a waiting tactic. In February 1942, the KPH leadership under Hebrang saw this as an opportunity for the Croatian Partisans to wrest the position of the central patriotic force among Croats from the HSS.

In effect, Hebrang thus pursued a policy close to the wartime Soviet coalitionist views, supporting a certain level of involvement of the former members of the HSS, and the Independent Democratic Party, as well as representatives of associations and trade unions in the political life as a form of a &quot;mass movement&quot;, including in the work of the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia as the top tier political body intended to grow into the future People&#x27;s Parliament of Croatia.

Furthermore, Hebrang declared support for more moderate social policies, and advocated Croatia&#x27;s autonomy within the Yugoslav federation. He argued that Serbs of Croatia should be primarily loyal to the Croatian federal unit which would ensure their political representation and preservation of their culture. Nonetheless, the increased Croatian character of the KPH caused anxiety among the Serbs. The independent policy pursued by the KPH brought Tito and Hebrang into conflict with pursuit of nationalist policy as the principal charge against the KPH. Due Hebrang&#x27;s popularity, the KPJ wanted to avoid antagonising Croats during the wartime struggle and instead, just two weeks before the Red Army and the Partisans took the capital from Germans, reassigned Hebrang to Belgrade to become the minister of industry and filled the leading role in the KPH with Vladimir Bakarić.

===Proclamation of new government===

In November 1942, the Partisans captured the town of Bihać and secured control over a large part of western Bosnia, Dalmatia and Lika they named the Bihać Republic. In the town, a pan-Yugoslav assembly – the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (, AVNOJ) – was established in the town at the initiative of Tito and the KPJ later that month. At its founding meeting, the AVNOJ adopted the principle of federal state as the solution for future. In the wake of the Bihać meeting, there were land councils established as political bodies representative of individual parts of the future federation.

The AVNOJ convened for the second time in Jajce in November 1943, declaring itself as the future parliament of the new Yugoslav state, affirmed commitment to forming a democratic federation without specifying any details of such federation. It also denied authority of the Yugoslav government-in-exile and forbade the King Peter II return to the country. A month before the Jajce meeting, the central committee of the KPJ created the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia as the new Yugoslav government, and the AVNOJ confirmed its composition – including Tito as its president. Tito&#x27;s position was reinforced through the Tito–Šubašić Agreements he concluded with the government-in-exile in the second half of 1944 and early 1945. On the basis of those agreements, the government-in-exile was replaced with the Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia with Tito as the Prime Minister on 7 March 1945.

During the war, the KPJ added new organisations based on foreseen federal units. In 1943, it established the Communist Party of Macedonia () and, in the final days of the war in May 1945, the KPJ founded the Communist Party of Serbia (). By the end of the war, the KPJ&#x27;s membership reached just over 141,000.

==Post-war consolidation of power==
===Drift to the one-party system===
In 1945, the KPJ worked to broaden its support, and discredit its political opponents. Since the politicians included in the government-in-exile only returned to Yugoslavia in March 1945, and Vladko Maček remained abroad, there was no well-organised political opposition to the KPJ. The People&#x27;s Front of Yugoslavia (, NFJ) was established in autumn of 1945, nominally a coalition of nearly all political parties in the country. A notable exception was Milan Grol&#x27;s Democratic Party which was charged with the Serbian nationalism. Besides the KPJ, the NFJ included weak and poorly organised bourgeois parties: the Yugoslav Republican Party, the Independent Democratic Party, the Agriculturalist&#x27;s Union, the Socialist Party, the JSDS, the Croatian Republican Peasant Party (, HRSS), and a group of politicians organised as the Forward () group. While non-communist parties in the NFJ hoped for equality, Tito primary saw the NFJ as a tool for neutralization of political opposition by allying them with the KPJ. Due to weakness of the non-communist parties in the NFJ, the KPJ dominated the group.

In preparation of the 1945 elections, the AVNOJ was expanded by addition of pre-war members of parliament deemed not compromised by cooperation with the Axis powers. In effect, this meant the addition of liberal and left-leaning politicians who could not be accused of collaborating with the Axis. Civil rights were curbed in the summer of 1945 when new legislation on crimes against the people and the state, curtailing the rights of assembly and freedom of the press. Middle and lower levels of bureaucracy were filled with the ranks of former Partisans.

Following a boycott proclamation by the Grol&#x27;s Democrats, the elections were carried out like a referendum–voting for the NFJ and against it. The NFJ slate received the highest approval in Croatia where the HRSS was aligned with the KPJ (81%), followed by Slovenia (78%) despite non-participation by the pre-war parties in the NFJ slate there, and the lowest support in Serbia (67%). This result is attributed to monarchism and the boycott. Ultimately, 88,43% of the electorate voted, and the NFJ was supported by 88,69% of the votes cast. The suffrage was universal for everyone over the age of 18 (including women for the first time), except those charged with Axis collaboration. Former Partisans could vote even if under 18. The KPJ received 404 representatives of 524 (77%) in the bicameral Constituent Assembly.

According to Đilas and Vladimir Velebit, the KPJ expected to win a majority of 60–65% even if the election were to guarantee fair competition. They based the opinion on the belief that the KPJ offered the opportunity to live in peace, an agrarian reform, and on post-war euphoria. In 1946, the parliament adopted a new Constitution implementing the ethnic federalism as the KPJ&#x27;s solution for the national question, modelled on the Soviet Union. By 1947, the KPJ declared that its programme was the NFJ&#x27;s programme and that the KPJ is in the forefront of the NFJ. Tito linked the collapse of the pre-war Yugoslavia with the multi-party system of government, justifying suppression of political opposition parties in the post-war context–calling the multi-party system incompatible with the socialist order and unnecessary. In October 1948, the four existing republican communist parties were complemented by two more: the Communist Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Communist Party of Montenegro.

===Break with the Soviet Union===

Objectives of the Soviet foreign policy gradually brought the USSR in conflict with the KPJ. Their relationship was complicated as the KPJ led armed resistance against the Axis while the Soviet foreign relations were initially constrained by provisions of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and then with alliance with the Western Allies who supported the Yugoslav government-in exile until shortly after the initial Tito–Šubašić Agreement. As Yugoslavia was not fully in the Soviet post-war sphere of influence, Tito pursued a foreign policy course seeking to integrate Albania into the Yugoslav federation, support the Greek communist guerrillas, and broaden ties between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria–potentially unifying the countries. Conclusion of the 1947 Bled Agreement seeking closer ties with Bulgaria, and imminent deployment of Yugoslav Army to Albania prompted a political confrontation with the USSR. The clash culminated in the Tito–Stalin split and the KPJ was expelled from the Cominform in 1948. For political reasons, the rift was presented as ideological rather than geopolitical one. The KPJ initially reacted to Stalin&#x27;s criticism by adopting corrective measures in the field of collectivisation described as more Stalinist than those employed by Stalin himself.

The KPJ saw purges of real or perceived Stalin supporters and other political opponents of the regime. In 1948–1951 period, more than 50,000 KPJ members (nearly 20% of its membership) were registered as political opponents and ejected, but the party expanded its ranks by more than half a million members in the same time frame. Virtually all parties within the NFJ or otherwise were dismantled following the Stalin letters in which the Soviet leader accused the KPJ of being diluted by the NFJ. The only exception was the HRSS, which was temporarily allowed to continue operating.
The exact number of those arrested remains uncertain, but in 1983, Radovan Radonjić stated that 16,288 were arrested and convicted, including 2,616 belonging to various levels of the KPJ leadership. According to Ranković, 51,000 people were killed, imprisoned or sentence to forced labour, a majority of them without trial. Prisoners were held at numerous sites, including a special-purpose prison camp built on the uninhabited Adriatic islands of Goli Otok and Sveti Grgur in 1949.

In view of the circumstances and the ideological aspect of the Yugoslav–Soviet split, the KPJ found it necessary to differentiate the Yugoslav political system from the Soviet one. Since the KPJ labelled the USSR undemocratic, it was necessary to devise and highlight KPJ&#x27;s innovative approach to communist rule. This was pursued through workers&#x27; self-management legislation introduced in 1950, as well as through opposition to Stalinism and inter-war Yugoslav unitarism. The approach led to a period of ideological revisionism in which established doctrines could be questioned.

===Reform and conflict with Đilas===

Even though Soviet and Cominform propaganda drew attention to inequalities in the economic development of various parts of Yugoslavia, alleging restoration of capitalism, and national oppression of the underdeveloped nations, the clash between strict centralisation and decentralisation appeared as a conflict between political principle and economic priorities. In 1950, Yugoslav authorities sought to combat unsustainable labour practices and improve production efficiency through introduction of workers&#x27; councils and the system which later became known as &quot;socialist self-management&quot;.

However, the 1946 Yugoslav constitution followed the model of the Soviet federation in which the federal parliament legislates laws applicable to the federal units and has the power to overrule the units&#x27; legislation. In 1952, Kardelj drafted constitutional amendments to reflect the reality of the reforms of 1950–1951. This led to codification of the reforms as 1953 Yugoslav constitutional amendments seeking to reflect the economic power of each constituent republic, while ensuring equal representation of each federal unit in the assembly to counterbalance this.

The KPJ proclaimed shift from party monopolising power to the ideological leader of the society, decentralised its structure, and rebranded itself (and correspondingly its republican organisations) as the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (, SKJ) at its sixth congress held in Zagreb in 1952. The name was inspired by the 1847–1852 Communist League founded by Marx, Engels and Schapper. The constitutional amendments, adopted in January 1953, were only the second step in a series of five constitutional reforms reflecting the social development of Communist-ruled Yugoslavia, but the principles introduced in 1953 were retained in all subsequent Yugoslav constitutions.

After the Yugoslav rapprochement with the USSR, Đilas feared Yugoslavia would switch to full control of the society by the central government. He thought that was possible due to influence of Ranković–the Đilas&#x27;s primary competitor as a potential successor to Tito. Đilas wrote a series of articles for &quot;Borba&quot; criticising bureaucratism and Communist exclusive claim to power. He took the criticism further in a compilation of essays, accusing the KPJ of elitism and enjoying privileges. In response, Đilas was removed from the KPJ central committee in January 1954 and soon he left the party altogether. In a subsequent &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview, he called for a multi-party system in Yugoslavia – and this led to his imprisonment. Đilas was pardoned in 1966.

===Yugoslavism campaign===

At the 7th Congress of the SKJ held in 1958, the party became more centralised. This was achieved by largely revoking decision-making powers previously given to republican branches of the SKJ. The party programme published at the Congress praised emerging Yugoslav consciousness and a series of articles was published advocating creation of unified Yugoslav culture. This decision built on introduction of the option of declaring one&#x27;s ethnicity as Yugoslav in the 1953 census, and the régime-sponsored 1954 Novi Sad Agreement on the single Serbo-Croatian language. Thus launched Yugoslavism campaign sought to replace federalism with unitarism. Ranković became the most prominent advocate of the campaign. He sought support from the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina (, SKBiH) and from the League of Communists of Montenegro (, SKCG) – with some success in the latter. In 1963, Serbia and Montenegro concluded several agreements on strengthening economic and cultural ties, including construction of the Belgrade–Bar railway.

The campaign was publicly criticised through an exchange of letters published in &quot;Borba&quot;. The proponents of the campaign, largely ethnic Serbs, were accused of scheming to abolish republics and resurrect Greater Serbian chauvinism. Particular opposition came from the League of Communists of Croatia (, SKH) and the League of Communists of Macedonia (, SKM). They were joined in an informal national-reformist coalition by the League of Communists of Slovenia (, ZKS) and, in a less prominent role, by the leadership of Vojvodina. In early 1963, Tito was compelled to publicly warn about chauvinism and reassure non-Serbs that merger of nations was not contemplated while defending the concept of Yugoslavism. Finally, at the 8th Congress of the SKJ held in 1964, Tito and Kardelj gave speeches criticising those thinking about merging nations of Yugoslavia as proponents of bureaucratic centralisation, unitarism and hegemony. There was no further mention of Yugoslavism at the Congress and the republican branches of the SKJ were given back their decision-making powers to reflect specificities and national character of the republics. The 8th Congress thus abandoned Yugoslavism in favour of decentralisation.

The SKJ promoted the notion of &quot;Yugoslav socialist patriotism&quot;. The concept was described by its advocates as the feeling or awareness and love of the socialist self-management community. According to the SKJ, the concept was unrelated to nationalism and ethnicity. The notion was also claimed to support values and traditions of ethnic groups living in Yugoslavia.

==Rise and fall of &quot;liberalism&quot;==
===Political factories===
The 1950s workers&#x27; self-management-based reforms created a distorted socialist market economy where prices were regulated, and regulations often changed. The policy allowed municipal-level authorities to establish and protect enterprises against market forces. Tito said that those enterprises, dubbed &quot;political factories&quot;, were only capable of producing losses. They competed for funding provided by federal investment funds – often through lobbying by republican-level officials - making the republics compete for limited resources.

In 1958, a miners&#x27; strike in Trbovlje fed into overall discontent in Slovenia regarding Yugoslav economic policy, and especially the management of federal investment funds. The event marked the first sign of growing divisions over economic development of the country and the political framework of the economic system. By 1961–62, the Yugoslav economy was in recession. The situation prompted small-scale economic reforms, which were quickly cancelled thereafter but led to a debate on economic issues. The debate coincided with adoption of the 1963 constitution expanding powers of the republics, and the 8th SKJ Congress expanding powers of the SKJ branches in 1964.

As a form of concession to the conservative factions within the SKJ, two new offices were created under the new constitution, taken by Ranković and Petar Stambolić. The former became the Vice-President, and the latter the federal Prime Minister - as the position was separated from that of the President.

===Competing economic models===
Republican leaderships advocated different economic development models. The ZKS in Slovenia and the SKH in Croatia favoured decentralisation and reduction of investment subsidies, and criticised the so-called political factories in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo. The SKM leadership in Macedonia favoured decentralisation because they feared Serbian domination more than the loss of federal funding.

Author Sabrina Ramet described the competing factions in the SKJ at the federal and republican levels in the 1962–87 period as &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives,&quot; based on whether they supported or opposed calls for decentralisation. Those holding the middle ground were termed &quot;brokers&quot; and included Tito, Bakarić, and Stambolić.

An opposing camp was formed by the League of Communists of Serbia (, SKS), the SKBiH in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the SKCG in Montenegro, who advocated continuing existing economic practices. In March 1966, the reformist group prevailed in the central committee of the SKJ, which supported economic reforms.

These coalitions varied as particular interests shifted. By the end of the decade, Vojvodina no longer supported Croatian and Slovenian positions, but on the other hand the SKCG in Montenegro was no longer in full alignment with the Serbian SKS, while Croatia&#x27;s SKH sought support from Kosovo&#x27;s communists.

The reform debate was initially confined to economists, but by 1964 it was taken up in political forums and media, where opposing factions accused each other of exploiting one another. These allegations built upon mutual resentments. Non-Serb population saw Serbs (and Montenegrins) as overrepresented at all levels of federal SKJ offices, in the security services, and in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) officer corps.

In addition, the growing development gap between Slovenia, Croatia, and Vojvodina on one hand and the rest of the country on the other was also a source of tensions. According to US consul to Zagreb, Helene Batjer, during the mid-1960s nationalism had increased as the result of years of economic austerity, political oppression, unprofitable investments in underdeveloped regions, and the failure of political leaders to deliver on their promises. It was also a form of protest against the dominant role of federal officials who were generally considered in Slovenia and Croatia to represent Serbia&#x27;s interests. According to Batjer, about 50% of members of ZKS in Slovenia and SKH in Croatia espoused nationalist views by then.

In 1965, the pro-reform campaign was presented as a push against inefficient economic practices. It led to a transfer of economic authority from the federal level to the republics, and to the abolition of the federally controlled general investment fund. Its assets were transferred to three federal Belgrade-based banks, while the republican-level communist party officials increased their influence over economies of their respective republics.

===Ranković affair===
By early 1966, it was evident that the economic reform did not produce the desired results. The SKJ discussed the failure and blamed the Serbian leadership for resistance to the reform. In the spring of 1966, Kardelj persuaded Tito to remove Aleksandar Ranković from the SKJ central committee and the position of the vice president of Yugoslavia. He was accused of plotting to seize power disregarding the decisions of the 8th Congress of the SKJ on decentralisation, and abuse of the State Security Administration directly or through allies. Specifically, he was accused of illegally wire-tapping SKJ leadership, including Tito.

The investigation of the Ranković affair was handled by a six-member commission with one member drawn from each republic. It was chaired by Krste Crvenkovski (Macedonia) and its members were Đuro Pucar (Bosnia), Blažo Jovanović (Montenegro), Dobrivoje Radosavljević (Serbia), Miko Tripalo (Croatia), and France Popit (Slovenia). Even though they were not members of the commission, the investigation was directed by Kardelj, Bakarić, and Stambolić who controlled the commission through influence exerted on its members. Ranković was not informed of the accusations and the investigation until shortly before the plenum held on Brijuni Islands on 1 July 1966.

Ranković was eventually removed from all his offices and expelled from the central committee. His allies and successors as federal ministers of the interior, Svetislav Stefanović and Vojin Lukić, were also dismissed and expelled from the SKJ. On the initiative of SKJ&#x27;s Kosovo organisation, supported by the SKCG, the SKBiH, and the SKM, Ranković was also expelled from the SKJ. Even though the SKJ took care to replace Ranković in all his former federal posts with ethnic Serbs, his ouster was perceived in Serbia and elsewhere in Yugoslavia as a Serbian defeat or even humiliation, resulting in Serb resentment.

Shortly after the fall of Ranković, the SKM of Macedonia called for political reforms. They proposed even greater decentralisation of the SKJ and giving veto powers to republican branches at federal-level decision-making by the SKJ. The plan was opposed by the SKS in Serbia but was supported to various degrees by others. While the debate was ongoing, the SKS leadership was replaced by reformist-leaning anti-nationalists Marko Nikezić and Latinka Perović who were made president of the central committee and the secretary of the executive committee respectively.

While Nikezić and Perović did not support the economic aspects of the reform advocated by the SKH in Croatia, they welcomed the call for greater liberalisation of media and politics. In 1969, the 9th Congress remained silent on the veto rights, but granted the branches the right to appoint federal-level officials and adopt their own statutes.

Provincial SKJ organisations in Kosovo and Vojvodina were raised to the level of provincial communist parties in 1968. Thus were formed the League of Communists of Vojvodina (, SKV) and the League of Communists of Kosovo (, SKK), which were simultaneously part of the Serbian SKS and the federal SKJ. This left only the party organisation in the JNA under direct control of the federal-level SKJ.

===Croatian Spring and purge of reformists===
In the atmosphere of the inter-republican disagreement on reform of banking and trade, the conflict assumed increasingly nationalist rhetoric. In 1967 and 1968, the Yugoslav constitution was amended once again, further reducing federal authority in favour of the constituent republics. The reformist forces grew in November 1968 when Marko Nikezić and Latinka Perović took helm of the SKS and advocated development through introduction of market economy practices and non-interference in other republics&#x27; affairs. The 9th Congress of the SKJ was held in March 1969, marking the peak of the reformist coalition. It pushed for decentralisation of all aspects of society. In the late 1960s, the relations between Slovenia&#x27;s ZKS and Croatia&#x27;s SKH became more strained, but the SKH and the Macedonian SKM successfully pressured the federal SKJ to adopt the principle of unanimity in decision-making, thus obtaining veto power for the republican branches of the SKJ in April 1970.

In the late 1960s, Croatia saw a resurgence of the national sentiment and Croatian nationalism in the form of Croatian Spring primarily through the cultural organisation Matica hrvatska, in response to instances of actual or perceived Serbian dominance. The SKH had no official position regarding Matica hrvatska until late 1969 or early 1970. Then a reformist faction of the SKH led by Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo gained control of the party and aligned themselves with Matica hrvatska to secure wider support in an intra-SKH power-struggle with a conservative faction.

For the SKH, grievances included economic issues such as rate of retention of hard currency earnings by Croatia-based companies, but the complaints were expanded to include various political demands seeking increased autonomy and opposition to over-representation of ethnic Serbs in security services, politics, and elsewhere. A particular point of contention was the matter of distinguishing Croatian language from Serbo-Croatian.

On 1 December 1971, Tito convened the 21st session of the SKJ presidium as a joint meeting with the SKH leaders where the SKH leadership was roundly criticised and told to regain control over nationalists. Within days, Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo resigned, and tens of thousands of members were expelled from the SKH. Even as thousands were persecuted for political crimes, Tito sought to undercut nationalist support by granting economic reform demands.

In January 1972, the SKJ adopted a programme of an ongoing fight against nationalism. In the process, reformist forces were targeted – Stane Kavčič was forced to resign in Slovenia, and the SKM faction of Krste Crvenkovski was ousted in Macedonia. In Serbia, Marko Nikezić, Latinka Perović, Mirko Tepavac and Bora Pavlović were accused of liberalism, particularly with their refusal to condemn the Croatian Spring, reconcilability with public critique of federal centralisation and requests to weaken SKJ&#x27;s party monopoly, as well as advocacy of democratic reforms of the socialist self-management in the country, and were forced to resign, while Koča Popović retired out of solidarity with purged members of the party. Their replacements were obedient but mediocre politicians.

Namely, 1971 constitutional amendments transferred significant powers away from the federation to the republics, and the new constitution adopted in 1974 preserved the 1971 reforms nearly completely. It even expanded republican economic powers by putting into law the reformist demands in the sectors of banking, commerce, and foreign currency. The purges of early 1970s drove many reformist communists and the social-democratic-minded away from politics in the final decades of Yugoslavia.

==Decline and dissolution==
After Tito&#x27;s death in 1980 the party adopted a collective leadership model, with the party presidency rotating annually. The party&#x27;s influence declined and the party moved to a federal structure giving more power to party branches in Yugoslavia&#x27;s constituent republics. Party membership continued to grow reaching two million in the mid-1980s but membership was considered less prestigious than in the past.

Slobodan Milošević became President of the League of Communists of Serbia in 1987 and combined certain Serbian nationalist ideologies with opposition to liberal reforms. The growing rift among the branches of the Communist Party and their respective republics came to a head at the SKJ&#x27;s 14th Congress, held in January 1990. The SKJ renounced its monopoly of power and agreed to allow opposition parties to take part in elections. However, rifts between Serbian and Slovenian Communists led the SKJ to dissolve into different parties for each republic.

On 22 January 1991, the Committee for the Preparation of the Democratic and Programmatic Renewal—the last federal organ of the LCY—abolished itself and on 24 February 1991, the last party branch, the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, left the LCY and became an independent party.

The Communist associations in each republic soon adopted the &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;social-democratic&quot; monikers, transforming into movements which were left-oriented, but no longer strictly communist.

* the League of Communists of Slovenia (ZKS) became the Party of Democratic Reforms of Slovenia in February 1990 (which merged in 1993 with several smaller parties to form the United List of Social Democrats, which in 2005 adopted their present-day form of Social Democrats)
* the League of Communists of Serbia (SKS) became the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) in July 1990
* the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH) became the Party of Democratic Changes (SDP) in November 1990 (which later merged with the much smaller Social Democrats of Croatia in 1994 and was renamed Social Democratic Party)
* the League of Communists of Macedonia (SKM) became the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) in April 1991
* the League of Communists of Montenegro (SKCG) became the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) in June 1991
* the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SKBiH) became the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDP BiH) in December 1992

<text>Twenty-five-thousanders (, &quot;dvadtsatipyatitysyachniki&quot;) was a collective name for the frontline workers from the major industrial cities of the Soviet Union who voluntarily left their urban homes for rural areas at the call of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to improve the performance of kolkhozes during the agricultural collectivisation in the Soviet Union in early 1930.

In November 1929, the of the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a decree on sending 25,000 workers with sufficient organizational and political experience to the rural areas to work in kolkhozy and in Machine and Tractor Stations (MTS). The decree found a broad response among the workers of the country, but they often had to fight resistance from their factories, which needed them to fill production quotas. In her history of the movement, Lynne Viola wrote:
The recruitment drive illustrated the sometimes contradictory nature of the first five-year plan revolution, which aimed for the maximum in economic modernization while at the same time insisting that modernization occur within the parameters of the social and political guidelines of the proletarian dictatorship. The factories were required to increase production while releasing their best workers for participation in the numerous mobilizations of skilled workers for promotion in the bureaucracy, the purge of the state administration, enrollment in higher technical education, and work in the countryside. The consequences of these contradictory demands were frequently inconsistency, disorder, and an uneasy balance between different institutional concerns, revealing a side of Soviet politics lacking unity of purpose and divided by differing interests. In the recruitment of the 25,000ers this meant that ultimately the state had to circumvent factory officialdom and, with the aid of the party organs, appeal directly to workers over the head of resistant factory officials for support in the campaign. And the result was that, in spite of the opposition of factory officials and problems in campaign implementation, the recruitment drive was an enormous success.
As a result, 27,519 people were selected from all over the Soviet Union and sent to work in the kolkhozy.

Analysis of the social structure of 23,409 twenty-five-thousanders with personal files reveals:

* Males - 92.3%, females - 7.7%
* Members of the CPSU - 69.9%
* Members of the Komsomol - 8.6%
* Members of the Metal Workers Union - approx. 16,000
* Individuals with no party affiliation - 21.5%
* Up to 5 years of work experience - 13% 
* 5 to 12 years of work experience - 39%
* More than 12 years of work experience - 48%

To prepare the twenty-five-thousanders for work in the rural areas, the Soviets organized special courses. Some volunteers were sent to sovkhozy for two or three months as interns. Most of the twenty-five-thousanders were sent directly to kolkhozy in the principal cereal regions of the country, such as Ukraine, North Caucasus, Lower and Middle Volga, the Black Earth Region and others.

The twenty-five-thousanders took part in establishing new kolkhozy and in strengthening the weak ones, conducting political, educational and cultural work among the inhabitants of the rural areas. They assisted kolkhozy in organizing stock, strengthening work-discipline and establishing &quot;correct&quot; product-distribution. Some of the twenty-five-thousanders were elected board members and chairmen of kolkhozy.

However, the twenty-five-thousanders encountered fierce resistance from the so-called kulaks, who opposed the socialist re-organization of agriculture.

Soviet literature treated the phenomenon of the twenty-five-thousanders extensively. Mikhail Sholokhov wrote one of the most famous books on this subject: &quot;Virgin Soil Upturned&quot; (, 1932 and 1960).

<text>A paper plane (also known as a paper airplane or paper dart in American English, or paper aeroplane in British English) is a toy aircraft, usually a glider, made out of a single folded sheet of paper or paperboard. It typically takes the form of a simple nose-heavy triangle thrown like a dart.

The art of paper plane folding dates back to the 19th century, with roots in various cultures around the world, where they have been used for entertainment, education, and even as tools for understanding aerodynamics.

The mechanics of paper planes are grounded in the fundamental principles of flight, including lift, thrust, drag, and gravity. By manipulating these forces through different folding techniques and designs, enthusiasts can create planes that exhibit a wide range of flight characteristics, such as distance, stability, agility, and time aloft. Competitions and events dedicated to paper plane flying highlight the skill and creativity involved in crafting the perfect design, fostering a community of hobbyists and educators alike.

In addition to their recreational appeal, paper planes serve as practical educational tools, allowing students to explore concepts in physics and engineering. They offer a hands-on approach to learning, making complex ideas more accessible and engaging. Overall, paper planes encapsulate a blend of art, science, and fun, making them a unique phenomenon in both childhood play and academic exploration.

==History==
Paper airplanes are known to have been made as far back as the mid 19th century, based on an American children&#x27;s book describing their construction from 1864.

The construction of a paper airplane, by Ludwig Prandtl at the 1924 banquet of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, was dismissed as an artless exercise by Theodore von Kármán:

Prandtl was also somewhat impulsive. I recall that on one occasion at a rather dignified dinner meeting following a conference in Delft, Holland, my sister, who sat next to him at the table, asked him a question on the mechanics of flight. He started to explain; in the course of it he picked up a paper menu and fashioned a small model airplane, without thinking where he was. It landed on the shirtfront of the French Minister of Education, much to the embarrassment of my sister and others at the banquet.

In recent times, paper model aircraft have gained great sophistication, and very high flight performance far removed from their origami origins, yet even origami aircraft have gained many new designs over the years, and gained much in terms of flight performance.

There have been many design improvements, including velocity, lift, propulsion, style, and fashion over subsequent years.

==Advanced paper gliders==
===Developments===
Paper gliders have experienced three forms of development in the period 1930–1988:
* High flight performance
* Scale modeling
* Use of CAD software

Ongoing development of folded/origami gliders over the same period has seen similar sophistication,
including the addition of the following construction refinements
* Increased fold-count, sometimes of an intricate nature
* Explicit kirigami (cutting of paper) as a component of design
* Requirements for additional ballast to ensure flight performance

===Technological introductions===
Technology responsible for the proliferation of advanced paper plane construction:
* Inexpensive CAD software for 2D part design
* Widespread manufacture, and inexpensive nature of acetal air-annealed glues, e.g. Bostik Clear-bond.
* Inexpensive ink and laser computer printers, for accurate aircraft part reproduction
* The advent of the Internet, and widespread information sharing

===Material considerations===
Compared to balsa material commonly used to fabricate model density is higher; consequentially, conventional origami paper gliders (see above) suffer from higher drag, as well as imperfectly aerodynamic wing chords.

However, unlike balsa gliders, paper gliders have a far higher strength-to-thickness ratio: 

===Directions in advanced paper aircraft design===
Unmodified origami paper aircraft have very poor glide ratios, often not better than 7.5:1 depending on construction and materials. Modification of origami paper gliders can lead to marked improvements in flight performance, at the cost of weight and often with the inclusion of aerodynamic and/or structural compromises. Often, increases in wing loading can encourage breakdown of laminar flow over a wing with a hybrid of origami and glued and taped construction.

Professors Ninomiya and Mathews developed more directed design strategies in the late 1960s and the 1980s. Previously, paper model aircraft had been designed without an emphasis on performance in flight. By using aerodynamic design, and fluid dynamics, both professors were able to design models that exceeded previous flight performance criteria by a very wide margin. Ranges of flight increased from the typical 10+ meters to 85+ meters, depending on energy input into the gliders on launch.

At present, the work of the two professors remains the last serious research work on improving the flight performance of paper model gliders.
Collaborative work by enthusiasts through online forums and personal websites are mostly developments of these original glider types.

In the field of scale model design, there are at present many possibilities for advanced design. Profile gliders encounter a limitation for improvement of flight performance based on their wing types, which are typically curved-plate aerofoils. In addition, fuselages are either balsa-paper or paper laminates, prone to warping or breakage over a very short time.
Improvement in performance is possible through modelling three-dimensional fuselages which encourage laminar flow, and in internally braced wings which can then have high-lift aerofoil profiles, such as the Clark Y or NACA 4 or 6 series, for high lift.

===White Wings===

In Japan in the late 1960s, Professor Yasuaki Ninomiya designed an advanced type of paper aircraft, which were published in two books, &quot;Jet Age Jamboree&quot; (1966) and &quot;Airborne All-Stars&quot; (1967). Designs from these books were later sold as the &#x27;White Wings&#x27; Series of paper glider packs from the 1970s to the present day.

White Wings are a stark departure from conventional paper aircraft, in that their fuselages and wings are paper templates cut and glued together. They were designed with the aid of low-speed aerodynamic engineering design principles. Construction of the models is of Kent paper, a grade of cartridge paper sold in Japan.

The early models were explicitly hand drawn, but by the 1980s these had their parts drafted with the use of CAD software.

Ninomiya&#x27;s designs also included, for the first time in any paper model, working propellers driven by airflow, in particular for his profile scale models of the Cessna Skymaster and Piaggio P.136 of 1967. Noteworthy as well was the careful design of gliders so that they could fly without ballast – his F-4 Phantom II model is able to be flown immediately without recourse to paperclips etc.

The high performance gliders have fuselages that are kept rigid by the use of a balsa fuselage profile bonded to the paper components. The paper used is quite heavy, approximately twice the weight of standard drawing cartridge paper, but lighter than lightweight cardboard. Original White Wings were entirely paper, requiring patience and skill. Later however, balsa-wood fuselages were used, and White Wings were sold &quot;pre-cut&quot;, making construction easier. The aerofoil used is a Göttingen 801 (curved plate), and a pattern is supplied as a cutout part of each kit.

===Paper Pilot===
In 1984, Professor E.H. Mathews, lecturer in Thermodynamics at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa published his first compendium of high-performance model aircraft. This book was &quot;Paper Pilot&quot; (Struik, 1984). This book was very successful, leading to additional volumes, &quot;Paper Pilot 2&quot; (1988), &quot;Paper Pilot 3&quot; (1991), &quot;12 Planes for the Paper Pilot&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ju 52&quot;, a stand-alone book featuring a scale model. Unpublished models include an Airbus A320 scale model much like the Ju 52, seen on the &quot;Tekkies&quot; youth program in 1996.

The books featured patterns of parts printed on lightweight cardstock, to give the aircraft good flight penetration performance for long-distance flight.

Public interest in the gliders, and their publishing success, allowed some of the development to be broadcast on South African television during 1988 on the first book&#x27;s release, and again 1993, to coincide with a national paper aeroplane competition tied to Paper Pilot 3&#x27;s release. Aerodynamic design of the gliders was achieved making use of an optimised small wind tunnel - the flat-glider Britten Norman Trislander was filmed in this facility, with weight balances being used to demonstrate the optimisation of flight. The design of parts of the gliders was achieved using Autodesk AutoCAD R12, then the most advanced version of this CAD software, and one of the first publicly available paper model aeroplanes designed using this technology.

Construction of the gliders closely parallels that used in the White Wings series of gliders of Dr. Ninomiya for flat gliders. Later gliders with three-dimensional fuselages use a lightweight construction optimised for flight performance. Innovations include functional wheeled undercarriage which does not contribute to the drag budget while permitting good landings.

Paper pilot gliders make use a curved-plate aerofoil shape for best performance. Their design, like the White Wings gliders, is very sensitive to trim, and in fact have the capacity to make indoor flights in confined spaces under average conditions. Most in initial editions are equipped with catapult hook patterns, and demonstrate an ability to fly the length of a Rugby pitch when so launched.

Later editions and gliders were equipped with a bungee hook, the construction of which was included in &quot;Paper Pilot 3&quot; and &quot;12 Planes for the Paper Pilot&quot;. The bungee system publish parallels, at a smaller scale, the practice used in radio controlled and full-size sailplane launches, at a fraction of the cost and complexity. To date, this is the only known example of such a launch system applied to a paper model aeroplane type published in book form. Flight performance on bungee is very good - one glider in particular, a scale model U-2 (in the last book of the series) had demonstrated flight performance in excess of 120 meters, on bungee hook launch.

===Paper helicopters (autogyros)===
The world&#x27;s first known published paper autogyro (engineless helicopter) by Richard K Neu appeared in &quot;The Great International Paper Airplane Book&quot; published in 1967. Its wings fly in a circle around a central ballast shaft as it descends vertically. This basic design has been published several times and is widely known.

The world&#x27;s first known published forward-gliding paper autogyro with forward-pointing body lifted by spinning blades was built by James Zongker. It appears on page 53 of &quot;The Paper Airplane Book: The Official Book of the Second Great International Paper Airplane Contest&quot; published in 1985 by Science Magazine. Its twin contra-rotating blades automatically spin on paper axles upon launch to provide lift.

E.H. Mathews developed a flight-stable paper model helicopter known as the Papercopter. This has a ring wing, and flaps for adjusting for flight for stability, positioned on the inboard edge of the ring. While not an autogyro per se, this paper model aircraft class falls within the general design of a paper model helicopter, and does possess a rotational flight element producing lift during forward flight. Papercopters, as Professor Mathews labeled them, are unique among paper model rotorcraft in having a range and velocity far in excess of all other classes, able to fly quite quickly, and with a range of between 10 and 15 m. The longest flight time is 27.9 seconds.

===World records===
There are multiple goals for a flight:
* Distance (javelin throwing).
* Time (javelin throwing straight up with subsequent metamorphosis into a sailplane).
* Aerobatic (looping).
* Stable flight to understand flight mechanics of a good plane.

For every goal there is a typical plane and sometimes a world record.
There have been many attempts over the years to break the barriers of throwing a paper plane for the longest time aloft. Ken Blackburn held this Guinness World Record for 13 years (1983–1996) and had regained the record in October 1998 by keeping his paper plane aloft for 27.6 seconds (indoors). This was confirmed by Guinness officials and a CNN report. The paper plane that Blackburn used in this record breaking attempt was a &quot;glider&quot;. , Takuo Toda (Japan) holds the world record for the longest time in air (29.2 seconds) in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima, Japan, on 19 December 2010. The current distance record, as of February 2023, is 88.318 m (289 ft 9 in) achieved by Dillon Ruble (USA), with the support of Nathaniel Erickson and Garrett Jensen (both USA) in Crown Point, Indiana, USA, on 2 December 2022.

==Aerodynamics==
===General aerodynamics===
Paper aircraft are a &quot;class&quot; of model plane, and so do not experience aerodynamic forces differently from other types of flying model. However, their construction material produces a number of dissimilar effects on flight performance in comparison with aircraft built from different materials.

In general, there are four aerodynamic forces that act on the paper aircraft while it is in flight:
* Thrust, which keeps the plane moving forward;
* Aerodynamic lift, acting on horizontal surface areas that lifts the plane upward;
* Gravity, which counteracts lift and pulls the plane downward; and
* Air drag, which counteracts thrust and reduces the plane&#x27;s forward speed.

Altogether, the aerodynamic forces co-interact, creating turbulence that amplifies small changes in the surface of the paper aircraft. Modifications can be made to most paper airplanes by bending, curving or making small cuts in the trailing edges of wings and in the airplane&#x27;s tail, if it has one.

The most common adjustments, modelled after glider aircraft, are ailerons, elevators, and rudders.

====Critical &quot;Re&quot;====
The &quot;Reynolds number&quot; (Re) range of the paper model aircraft is reasonably wide:
* 2,000–12,000 for Origami aircraft
* 4,000–16,900 for Compound Origami (involving adhesives and aerodynamic refinements)
* 9,000–39,000 for Profile Performance (White Wings, Paper Pilot, et al.)
* 19,200–56,000 for Scale Performance (White Wings, Paper Pilot, et al.)
* 22,000–93,000 for Scale Models (complex structures)

These ranges are indicative. As noted above the mass: density ratio of paper prevents performance from reaching those of balsa models in terms of expressions of power to weight, but for models with wingspans of between 250 mm and 1,200 mm, the critical &quot;Re&quot; is very similar to balsa model gliders of similar dimensions.

Paper models typically have a wing aspect ratio that is very high (model sailplanes) or very low (the classic paper dart), and therefore are in almost all cases flying at velocities far below their wing planform and aerofoil critical &quot;Re&quot;, where flow would break down from laminar to turbulent.

Most origami paper darts tend to be flying within turbulent air in any case, and as such, are important to research into turbulent flow as are low-Re lifting surfaces found in nature such as leaves of trees and plants as well as the wings of insects.

High performance profile and scale models do approach their wing section&#x27;s critical Re in flight, which is a noteworthy achievement in terms of paper model design. Performance is derived of the fact that wings of these gliders are in fact performing as well as it is possible for them to perform, given their material limitations.

Experiments in different material finishes in recent years have revealed some interesting relationships in Re and paper models. Performance of origami and compound origami structures improves markedly with the introduction of smooth paper, though this is also aided by the paper&#x27;s higher mass and consequently better penetration.

More marginal performance and scale types generally do not benefit from heavier, shinier surfaces. Performance profile-fuselage types do experience somewhat improved performance if shiny, slippery paper is used in construction, but although there is a velocity improvement, this is offset very often by a poorer life-to-drag ratio. Scale types have experience negative performance at the addition of heavy shiny papers in their construction.

====Aerofoils====
Wing profile sections in models vary, depending on type:
* Origami : Göttingen flat-plate, or Jedelsky-form for folded leading edges.
* Compound Origami: Identical with origami, though often with sealed edges – 45% improvement in Cd.
* Profile Performance: Göttingen curved-plate, with profile similar to Göttingen 801.
* Scale Performance: Göttingen 801 or any other wing aerofoil
* Scale Models: This varies on model type (see below)

Camber of profiles varies, too. In general, the lower the Re, the greater the camber. Origami types will have &#x27;ludicrous&#x27; or very high cambers in comparison with more marginally performing scale types, whose escalating masses demand higher flying speeds and so lower induced drag from high camber, though this will vary depending on type being modelled.

In the case of scale performance and scale models, the modellers intent will define the type of aerofoil section chosen. WWI biplanes, if designed for flight performance, will often have curved-plate aerofoils, as these produce a highly cambered surfaces and Coefficient of Lift (Cl) for low gliding airspeeds. WWII monoplanes will often have very scale-like sections, though with increased trailing edge droop to improve camber in comparison with scale counterparts.

Similarly, size, airspeed and mass will have very big impacts on choice of aerofoil, though this is a universal consideration in model plane design, no matter the material.

====Origami Flying Wings====
The former Guinness world record holder Tim Richardson disagrees with the decision to put a &#x27;tail&#x27; on the paper plane. His explanation of paper plane aerodynamics on his website mentions that the tail is not needed. He uses the real-life B-2 Spirit flying wing bomber as an example, stating that the weights along the wing should be put forward in order to stabilize the plane. (Note: paper planes do not need a tail primarily because they typically have a large, thin fuselage, which acts to prevent yaw, and wings along the entire length, which prevents pitch.)

Independently, Edmond Hui invented a Stealth Bomber-like paper plane called the Paperang in 1977, based on hang glider aerodynamics. Uniquely, it has properly controlled airfoil sections, high-aspect-ratio wings, and a construction method designed to allow the builder to vary every aspect of its shape. It was the subject of a book, &quot;Amazing Paper Airplanes&quot; in 1987, and a number of newspaper articles in 1992. It is ineligible for most paper plane competitions due to the use of a staple, but it has extremely high gliding performance exceeding glide ratios of 12 to 1 with good stability.

In 1975, origami artist Michael LaFosse designed a pure origami (one sheet; no cutting, glue or staples...) flying wing, which he named the &quot;Art Deco Wing&quot;.Though its aerodynamic form mimics some hang glider and supersonic airfoils, its invention evolved from exploring the beauty of folded paper first. Its glide ratio and stability are on a par with many of the best paper wing constructions that use glue, tape or staples. This design was first published in 1984 in the book &quot;Wings and Things&quot;, by Stephen Weiss, St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

Although it is a common view that light paper planes go farther than heavy ones, this is considered to be untrue by Blackburn. Blackburn&#x27;s record-breaking 20-year-old paper plane was based on his belief that the best planes had short wings and are &quot;heavy&quot; at the point of the launch phase in which the thrower throws the paper plane into the air, and at the same time longer wings and a &quot;lighter&quot; weight would allow the paper plane to have better flight times but this cannot be thrown hard with much pressure into the air as a &quot;heavy&quot; weighted launch phase. According to Blackburn, &quot;For maximum height and for a good transition to gliding flight, the throw must be within 10 degrees of vertical&quot; — which shows that a speed of at least is the amount needed to throw the paper plane successfully.

After the folding there are still gaps between different layers of folded paper (tearoff edge). These and the kinks transversal to the airflow may have a detrimental effect on aerodynamics, especially on the upper side of the wing. In some models the surfaces are not aligned to the direction of flow acting as airbrakes. Typically the center of mass is at 1/81 and the center of area is at 1/2 of the plane lengths. Two methods exist to shift the center of mass to the front. One rolls up the leading edge which then stays unswept. The other uses a swept wing or axial folding to produce something like a fuselage extending out of leading edge of the wing.

====Other designs====
It is possible to create freestyle versions of paper aircraft, which often exhibit an unusual flight path compared to more traditional paper darts, jets and gliders. Another propulsion technique, creating high launch velocities, involves the use of elastic bands for &quot;catapults&quot;. Walkalong gliding involves the continuous propulsion of paper airplane designs (such as the tumblewing, follow foil and paper airplane surfer) by soaring flight on the edge of a sheet of cardboard.

==Space flight==

There may one day be a paper plane launched from space. A prototype passed a durability test in a wind tunnel in March 2008, and Japan&#x27;s space agency JAXA considered a launch from the International Space Station. However, the plane developers, Takuo Toda (see World Records above) and fellow enthusiast Shinji Suzuki, an aeronautical engineer and professor at Tokyo University, postponed the attempt after acknowledging it would be all but impossible to track them during the planes&#x27; week-long journey to Earth, assuming any of them survived the searing descent. The developers were hoping that China or Russia will back further efforts on the project.

In February 2011, 200 planes were launched from a net underneath a weather balloon above Germany. The planes were designed to maintain stable flight even in gusts up to . The planes were equipped with memory chips from which data could be uploaded, and were reported as having been found in other places in Europe, as well as Canada, India, South Africa and Australia. A spokesman for the project said he was &quot;bit suspicious&quot; of reports from the southern hemisphere, but said that planes reaching America was possible given the &quot;substantial&quot; winds encountered by the planes, and the fact that a well-built paper plane &quot;travels 12 feet across the ground for every foot it drops&quot;.

On 24 June 2015, a club from Kesgrave High School in Suffolk, United Kingdom, achieved the world record for the highest altitude paper plane launch, reaching an altitude of .

<doc id="1129700" wikidata="Q2088141" url="?curid=1129700" title="Caucasian Imamate">
<text>The Caucasian Imamate, also known as the North Caucasus Imamate (), was a state established by the imams in Dagestan and Chechnya during the early-to-mid 19th century in the North Caucasus, to fight against the Russian Empire during the Caucasian War, where Russia sought to conquer the Caucasus in order to secure communications with its new territories south of the mountains.

==Background==

Previously in the Northeast Caucasus, there had, since recordable history, been a large array of states.

Caucasian Albania had existed in Southern Dagestan, for most of its history being a vassal under the direct rule of the Parthians and later the Sasanid Persians, but eventually, the majority converted to Islam following the Muslim conquest of Persia, as their overlords did. Traveling Arabs proved to be instrumental in this, and after they left, they relinquished the new Muslim states of Lezghia (centered in the Islamic learning center of Derbent), Lakia (centered in another, rival city of Islamic learning, Kumukh) and their less important neighbors. In these areas (Southern and Southeast Dagestan), where interethnic conflict was often present, Islam served a unifying role, and it was often the clerical establishment which mediated disputes.

In Chechnya, Islam was considerably less ingrained than in the Imamate&#x27;s other claims. Islam only began to make inroads in Chechnya during the 16th century, and even then was not highly important, with the indigenous Vainakh religion still holding strong. It was only at the point of the threat of Russian conquest that people began to turn en masse, to Islam as a way to mobilize a coordinated resistance to Russian encroachment. Islam was spread to the Chechens this way mainly through the work of Sheikh Mansur. Nonetheless, as Shamil and his predecessors discovered, the actual commitment of the Chechens to Islam was disappointingly small. Paganism remained in practice until the early 19th century.

However, although Islam was indeed extremely important in parts of the Caucasus, and was also a unifying force for resistance to Russia, political Islam was challenged by many different groups. Islam in Central and Northern Dagestan and Chechnya was overwhelmingly Naqshbandi at this time. However, Naqshbandiism, which was highly mystical in nature, had internal divisions over whether it should be political or whether, indeed, political Sufism tainted the religion&#x27;s purity. The drive to establish sharia law, in particular, was opposed on many fronts. First of all, the indigenous Caucasian states run by Avars, Kumyks, Lezgins, Laks and others (particularly the widow ruler Pakhu Bike, Queen of the Khanate of Avaria) opposed it as it seemed to take legitimacy away from their own positions. Sharia also clashed with &quot;adat&quot;, the indigenous law system that many, especially peoples such as the Chechens, viewed as superior to sharia. For these reasons, and other more subtle ones, in most areas the Imamate claimed as its domain, it was, in fact, simply viewed as the lesser evil to Russia.

==Establishment==

Parts of the Muslim population started to radicalize due to rapacious Russian activity and taxation and were calling for a Gazawat (Holy War) and the enforcement of Sharia. Two imams, Imam Ghazi Muhammad and Imam Shamil, attempted to initiate the Gazawat they called for by trying to seize the capital of Khunzakh from the khan of Pakkou-Bekkhe in 1827. The attack failed and so, disheartened, the imams bided their time, waiting for the various Muslim tribes to agree with one another. In 1828, the two attacked again, this time in Northern Dagestan, and with success.

The Russians, who at the time ruled over Northern Dagestan, were used to fighting on the open battlefields of Europe in lined formation instead of the thick woods of the Caucasus and so were very unprepared for the guerrilla tactics of the two imams, resulting in a victory for Ghazi and Shamil. However, this action would start the Caucasian War , a war between the Imamate and Russia that would eventually lead to the capture of all the Caucasus by the Russian Empire.

Here the Imamate was formed, with Ghazi self-appointed as its first leader. The supreme government body of the Imamate, the State Council (Dīvān) was formed which consisted of Sufi Muslim scholars and students as well as Shamil&#x27;s military lieutenants, his &quot;Naibs&quot;.

For military details see Murid War.

==Expansion==

During the war, the Imamate would see support from other Muslim tribes, eventually amalgamating with Chechnya, parts of Ingushetia and the rest of Dagestan during the Imamship of Imam Shamil. The
western tribes, the Adyghes, would fall under the control of the Imamate during Shamil&#x27;s rule as well, but a problem arose in the form of the Kabardins and Ossetians that sat in between Shamil&#x27;s east and west tribes, so these tribes were run mainly by Shamil&#x27;s &quot;naibs&quot; who had traveled to the west instead of the &quot;Dīvān&quot; itself.

==Politics==
The Imamate&#x27;s first leader was Imam Ghazi Muhammad, who ruled from 1828 until 1832 when he was succeeded by Hamzat Bek four years later. When he was murdered in 1834, by a band which included Hadji Murad, Shamil became the third imam. The Imamate reached its peak under Shamil&#x27;s rule, spanning all of the Muslim Northern Caucasus.

The Imamate was a highly militaristic country, having been at war since its establishment. Its politics were always concerned with the furthering of Islam or the Caucasian War. As such, the only people that ever sat on its council were Muslim scholars or military &quot;naibs&quot;.

==The war and the surrender of the Imamate==
The North Caucasians gained several great victories early in their war with Russia, but at the time Russia hadn&#x27;t really committed to the war seriously. With their great victory over Napoleon&#x27;s Grand Army in 1812, the Russian people saw little concern in the petty &quot;Asiatic&quot; resistance occurring on their southern borders. However, the North Caucasians did reach a point where they pushed the Russians back hard enough to warrant a full-scale Russian counter-attack. In 1832 Shamil and Ghazi launched a failed attack on Vladikavkaz, which was at the time a Russian military fort mockingly named &quot;Ruler of The Caucasus&quot; - from + . The Russians countered: General launched an assault on the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Imamate, the small settlement of Gimry. This resulted in the seizure of the town by the Russians (October 1832) and the death of Ghazi Muhammad. Shamil himself, the only man to escape the battle, went into hiding to evade the Russians. Everyone assumed that he had died.

In the absence of Shamil, an imam by the name of Hamzat Bek ruled (1832–1834). Hamzat Bek, an imam who had played a vital role in securing the Avar Khans for the Imamate, had since been a &quot;naib&quot; to Shamil and Ghazi. Shamil returned a year later, but Hamzat Bek was assassinated by the same Avar Khanates he had defeated. With no one else to take the position, Shamil became the third leader of the Imamate. Shamil would turn out to be the greatest of the Imams by far and would rule for 25 years (1834–1859).

Shamil sought to build on British popular support for his anti-Russian struggle in &quot;the Great Game&quot; context, but no official British assistance arrived.
Shamil conquered the Western Muslim tribes, and transformed a group of small bickering villages into a united country. However, he also saw great casualties to his people, particularly in the Siege of Akhoulgo in Dagestan in 1839, where he lost around 4500 of his own people. But he continued to rule until 1859, when Emperor Alexander II of Russia offered Shamil a peaceful surrender - he would even be a guest of the imperial palace. Shamil agreed, and the Caucasian Imamate was no more. However, fighting did not immediately cease.

===The fate of Imam Shamil===

As Charles King notes,

Whereas previous enemies of the empire had been imprisoned, killed or exiled, Shamil became a national celebrity [in Russia]. After his surrender, he settled into a comfortable retirement in Kaluga, southeast of Moscow.

In 1859, Shamil wrote to one of his sons: &quot;By the will of the Almighty, the Absolute Governor, I have fallen into the hands of unbelievers... the Great Emperor... has settled me here... in a tall, spacious house with carpets and all the necessities.&quot;

==Fourth Imamate==
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, an attempt to reestablish the Imamate with the help of Turkey, during March–April 1918, was made by the son of one of Shamil&#x27;s naibs, Najmuddin Hotso. This name stems from the Dagestani settlement of Gotso (when he was awarded nobility by Tsar). He was pronounced the fourth Imam of the North Caucasus and deposed the Soviet power, but was soon defeated by the Soviets. Hotso only had support in Dagestan, and there he carried on his fight (in Chechnya, meanwhile, North Caucasian nationalists of various creeds similarly went into guerrilla war against the Russians). Both rebellions were finally quelled in 1925.

<doc id="1129704" wikidata="Q1677658" url="?curid=1129704" title="William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus">
<text>William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus (15543 March 1611) was a Scottish nobleman. He was the son of William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus (1533–1591).

==Career==
Douglas studied at St. Andrews University and joined the household of the Earl of Morton. Subsequently, while visiting the French court, he became a Catholic, and was in consequence, upon his return, disinherited and placed under restraint.

Nevertheless, Douglas succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles and estates in 1591, and though in 1592 he was disgraced for his complicity in Lord Bothwell&#x27;s plot, he was soon liberated and performed useful services as the King&#x27;s Lieutenant in the north of Scotland. In June 1592 he was injured falling from his horse while hunting with James VI and sent for drugs from the surgeon Gilbert Primrose.

In July 1592 he asked for help from Queen Elizabeth in a plot with the Earl of Erroll and other lords against John Maitland of Thirlestane, the Chancellor. Lord Maxwell accused him of misdemeanours including meeting the rebels James Douglas of Spott and the Countess of Bothwell. He protested his absolute rejection of Spanish offers, but in October he signed the Spanish Blanks. On the discovery of this treason he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle on his return to Scotland in January 1593.

Douglas escaped from Edinburgh Castle on 13 February 1593 with the help of his Countess, joining the Earls of Huntly and Erroll in the north. They were offered an Act of &quot;oblivion&quot; or &quot;abolition&quot; provided they renounced their religion or quit Scotland. Declining these conditions they were declared traitors and &quot;forfeited.&quot;

They remained in rebellion, and in July 1594 an attack made by them on Aberdeen roused James&#x27;s anger. Huntly and Erroll were subdued by James himself in the north, and Angus failed in an attempt upon Edinburgh in concert with the Earl of Bothwell.

Subsequently, in 1597 they all renounced their religion, declared themselves Presbyterians, and were restored to their estates and honours. Angus was again included in the Privy Council, and in June 1598 was appointed the King&#x27;s Lieutenant in southern Scotland, in which capacity he showed great zeal and conducted the &quot;Raid of Dumfries,&quot; as the campaign against the Johnstones was called. At Christmas time in 1598 the English diplomat George Nicholson heard that people were saying Angus wore a jewel resembling a cross in his hat (which might be taken a sign of Catholicism), but the king said it was not and laughed at their daftness.

Angus, offended at the advancement of Huntly to a Marquessate, recanted, resisted all the arguments of the ministers to bring him to a &quot;better mind,&quot; and was again excommunicated in 1608.

In 1609 Douglas withdrew into exile, and died in Paris, France, on 3 March 1611. He is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

A household account for the Earl survives. It commences on 11 June 1608 when the Earl moved his lodging in Glasgow from the house of George Lyon to that of John Ross. In October he moved to the Canongate of Edinburgh. On 5 November he moved to Tantallon Castle.

==Quotation==
From &quot;The Scottish Nation&quot;:

==Marriage and children==
Douglas married Elizabeth Oliphant, a daughter of Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant, in spring 1585, and they had three sons and three daughters. His second son, James, was created Lord Mordington in 1641. His daughter Mary was married to Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow.

Douglas was succeeded by his son William, as 11th earl of Angus, afterwards 1st marquess of Douglas (1580–1660). The title Earl of Angus is now held by the Duke of Hamilton, and is used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to the current dukedom.

<text>Modjo was a French house music duo formed in Paris in 1999 by producer Romain Tranchart (born 9 June 1976) and singer Yann Destagnol (born 14 July 1978), best known for their greatest hit &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight)&quot; released in 2000, and hits such as &quot;Chillin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;No More Tears&quot; released in 2001.

==Background==
Romain Tranchart moved with his family to Algeria and Mexico, to finally live in Brazil. There, he started learning the guitar, finding inspiration through jazz classics.

Also Parisian, Yann Destagnol learned to play flute and clarinet when he was a small child. As he aged he became deeply influenced by the Beatles, the Beach Boys, David Bowie and other pop acts. He started to play drums by emulating them. He also learned to play the piano and the guitar. He later bought himself a four-track recording machine and started songwriting and singing. Fascinated more by voices than by charismatic band leaders, he liked bands such as Aerosmith, The Police and Queen and later became a great fan of R&amp;B divas.

<doc id="1129712" wikidata="Q6777206" url="?curid=1129712" title="Martins Heron">
<text>Martins Heron is a suburb of Bracknell west of London in Berkshire, England. Martins Heron and the neighbouring suburb The Warren are after a Parliamentary Boundary review in the Bracknell constituency – until 2010 they were in the Windsor Constituency. It is in the Swinley Forest ward, which also includes Forest Park.

The name does not in fact have anything to do with the avian heron but stems from the obsolete word &quot;hern&quot;, meaning nook or corner of land. The area is bordered by Bracknell to the west and large wooded areas, notably Swinley Woods on the east and Lily Hill Park to the north.

==History==

The area lies within the former parkland and grounds of a mansion, Martins Herne (or Heron), built around 1750 but demolished in the early 1980s, which was associated with minor nobility for much of its life, including the 18th-century British general, William Gordon. The house made way for a small estate of mainly large detached houses built by Charles Church Developments.

==Amenities==

Tesco Martins Heron was opened in the 1980s and was extended in 2008, drastically increasing its size and drawing new customers to the area. However this had been an issue that had been addressed by the local residents many times, and it had taken years for Tesco to receive planning permission to go ahead with the build. The new store was finished in May 2008.

Next to Tesco, sits the Martins Heron and The Warren Community Hall. This is a small local hall, which has also been refurbished. It had an extension built at the start of the new millennium, and now contains the main hall, as well as the annexe hall, cloakrooms and a small waiting area. It is mostly used by the local nursery school, as well as the Martins Heron School of Dance, which holds classes most evenings during term time.

==Transport==

Martins Heron railway station serves commuters travelling to London Waterloo and Reading, Berkshire. The railway station is small but is staffed during the morning and is equipped with CCTV. The station is situated right next to the Tesco supermarket, and part of the building costs were contributed by the retailer as a precondition of the supermarket being built.

==In popular culture==
Martins Heron is well known locally as being the site of Harry Potter&#x27;s uncle and aunt&#x27;s house. The filmed version of the first of JK Rowling&#x27;s famous stories, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was filmed partly on location. The external scenes with the actor Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter at his house were shot on location at a house in Picket Post Close, Martins Heron. However, according to the documentary &quot;Creating the World of Harry Potter&quot;, logistics made this location impractical as a long-term filming location, so a portion of the street was recreated on the backlot of Leavesden Film Studios.

Martins Heron Tesco was also used for filming. Until 2009 it was one of the very few Tesco supermarkets in the country that was not open on Sunday, owing to concerns from local residents. It also had restricted opening hours on weekdays. It has therefore been used as a filming location for many of the Tesco television adverts featuring Prunella Scales and Jane Horrocks among others.

<doc id="1129727" wikidata="Q1839" url="?curid=1129727" title="Laurent Blanc">
<text>Laurent Robert Blanc (; born 19 November 1965) is a French professional football manager and former player who played as a centre-back and is the manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad. He has the nickname &quot;Le Président&quot;, which was given to him following his stint at Marseille in tribute to his leadership skills. He is regarded as one of the greatest defenders in the history of the sport.

Blanc played professional football for numerous clubs, including Montpellier, Napoli, Barcelona, Marseille, Inter Milan and Manchester United, often operating in the sweeper position. He is also a former French international, earning 97 caps and scoring 16 international goals. He represented the country in several international tournaments, including the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, both of which France won. On 28 June 1998, Blanc scored the first golden goal in World Cup history against Paraguay.

He began his managerial career at Bordeaux in 2007, winning domestic honours including the 2008–09 Ligue 1 title. After leaving Bordeaux in 2010 he became the manager of the France national team until 2012, replacing Raymond Domenech in the wake of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and leading the country to the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2012. In 2013, he was hired by Paris Saint-Germain, winning further honours. After three successful years with Paris Saint-Germain he left the club in June 2016. Following more than six years without coaching in Europe, he was appointed manager by Lyon in October 2022.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Blanc was born in Alès, Gard, France. His career started at Montpellier, where he signed his first professional contract in 1983. A very technical, yet slow player, he played as an attacking midfielder and helped the club get promoted to Division 1 in 1987. Only a few years later did he settle as a defender following the advice from Michel Mézy, a position in which his physical stature (1.92 m, 86 kg) and his temperament would prove invaluable. His game being perfectly fitted for the French league, he managed to score at least 12 Division 1 goals per season in his last three seasons at Montpellier, for the most part penalties and headers. He also won the Coupe de France in 1990, scoring a goal in the final match. Blanc remains Montpellier&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer, with 83 in all competitions (76 altogether in Division 1 and Division 2). On 5 August 2017, Souleymane Camara scored the only goal (in the 59th minute) in Montpellier&#x27;s Matchday 1 Ligue 1 1–0 win against Caen to register his 48th Ligue 1 goal for Montpellier, breaking Blanc&#x27;s longstanding Montpellier record of 47 Division 1 goals scored in four seasons.

In 1991, Blanc tried his luck abroad when he left Montpellier for Napoli in the Italian Serie A. Despite a decent season, during which he managed to score six goals, he felt like he could not fully express his potential and returned to France after just one year, to Nîmes and then Saint Étienne, where again he imposed himself as one of the best defenders in the league. Although Blanc scored 13 goals in his last season at Saint-Étienne, les Verts were almost relegated, only staying up because Marseille were not allowed to return to the first division because of the club&#x27;s financial difficulties. Guy Roux, impressed by Blanc and looking for a replacement for Dutch international Frank Verlaat, convinced him to join Auxerre in 1995. Despite injuring himself early in the season, Blanc came back strongly and played a great part in the team&#x27;s double that year.

===Barcelona===
Blanc&#x27;s success at Auxerre drew the attention of several big European clubs. Blanc agreed to join Barcelona in Spain largely because manager Johan Cruyff wanted him and persuaded him to sign. But on the very day that Blanc said yes to &quot;Barça&quot;, Cruyff was sacked, and Blanc&#x27;s spell with the club was a less than happy one. Blanc was in the side when Barcelona won the Supercopa de España against Atlético Madrid, but was injured soon afterwards. He played regularly upon his return from injury, but was sent off during the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-final against AIK. He then injured himself again against Extremadura, which forced him to miss the &quot;Clásico&quot; and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain. After this disappointing season and only one year away from the 1998 World Cup, he decided to leave.

===&quot;Le Président&quot;===
Rolland Courbis managed to convince Blanc to join Marseille, which proved beneficial for both the club and Blanc. Blanc quickly became a leader in a team that was desperately lacking confidence, and helped Marseille finish in fourth place in his first season, during which he scored 11 goals and earned the nickname &quot;Le Président&quot; (&quot;The President&quot;). The season following the World Cup was both successful and frustrating for Blanc and Marseille, as they finished runners-up in the championship, only one point shy of Bordeaux, and reached the UEFA Cup final, only to lose 3–0 to Parma, with Hernán Crespo intercepting Blanc&#x27;s back pass to Stéphane Porato to score the opener. Afterwards, Blanc left Marseille for Inter Milan, where he enjoyed some success, winning the &quot;Pirata d&#x27;Oro&quot; (Inter Player of the Year) in 2000.

===Manchester United===
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had attempted to lure Blanc several times since 1996 and finally succeeded in August 2001 when, at the age of 35, Blanc was brought in to replace the departing Jaap Stam. He was criticised for poor performances in the early months of his stay at Old Trafford, when United suffered five defeats in the league by 1 December 2001 – with some critics even being keen to point out that the five teams who had beaten them in the league began with the letters which spelt out Blanc&#x27;s surname – &quot;Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle United, and Chelsea.&quot; He initially arrived at Old Trafford on a one-year contract, and as his form and his team&#x27;s form improved throughout the season (although it wasn&#x27;t enough for United to catch Arsenal in the title race or advance beyond Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League semis), he was eventually awarded a fresh one-year contract to give him a second season in Manchester. He was nicknamed &quot;Larry White&quot; by fans as a loose translation of his name.

He scored four goals during his time at Manchester United. One of these came in the league against Tottenham Hotspur, and the other three all came in the Champions League in games against Olympiacos and Boavista (both home and away). Blanc retired from football after helping United win the 2002–03 FA Premier League title.

==International career==
Blanc won the 1988 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, his team beating Greece in the final. He was named the tournament&#x27;s Golden Player by UEFA.

On 7 February 1989, Blanc made his debut for the senior national team against the Republic of Ireland. France, then in reconstruction after the retirement of numerous key players, did not manage to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Shortly after that, they started an impressive 19-game unbeaten streak, including eight wins out of eight in Euro 1992 qualifying, making them one of the favorites to win the competition. They would, however, get knocked out in the group stage by eventual winners Denmark.

After France failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Blanc was heavily criticised, as well the rest of the team, and he subsequently decided to retire from international football. Aimé Jacquet, after taking over the managerial position of the national team, made it one of his priorities to convince Blanc to change his mind. Blanc returned to the team for the Euro 1996 qualification campaign and scored in a 4–0 win over Slovakia. At the tournament finals, he formed a central defensive partnership with Marcel Desailly. Blanc scored France&#x27;s opening goal in the final group match against Bulgaria in a 3–1 win to put the team into the quarter-finals, where they faced the Netherlands at Anfield. Blanc scored France&#x27;s winning penalty kick in the shootout after the match had ended 0–0. France then lost on penalty kicks at the semi-final stage after drawing 0–0 with the Czech Republic. However, Blanc again successfully converted his kick.

France then entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which was held on home soil. Blanc was exemplary during the competition and, on 28 June 1998, scored the first-ever golden goal in World Cup history against Paraguay in the round of 16. In the quarter-final, Blanc helped France to a clean sheet over Italy and scored the winning penalty as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; prevailed in the shootout. He missed the final after being sent off in the semi-final against Croatia for slapping Slaven Bilić. The sending off was the first (and only) red card of Blanc&#x27;s international professional career. Despite Blanc&#x27;s absence, France lifted the World Cup for the first time after defeating Brazil 3–0 at the Stade de France.

Blanc was also part of the team that won UEFA Euro 2000 during which, despite having been criticised for his age and lack of speed during the qualifications, he proved reliable in defence and even scored France&#x27;s first goal of the tournament against Denmark in the group stage. He announced his retirement from international football after the competition, following the example of his captain Didier Deschamps. On 2 September 2000, Blanc, along with Deschamps and Bernard Lama, played his final match for &quot;Les Bleus&quot; in a friendly against England at the Stade de France.

Blanc was well known for kissing good friend and goalkeeper Fabien Barthez&#x27;s head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck (the two did repeat this ritual when they played together for Manchester United, but only for Champions League matches). The France national team was unbeaten in all matches when it fielded the World Cup and European Championship winning defence of Blanc, Desailly, Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu. Overall, Blanc recorded 97 caps and scored 16 goals. In 1999, the readers of &quot;France Football&quot; magazine voted him the fourth-best French player of all time, behind Michel Platini, Zinedine Zidane and Raymond Kopa.

==Managerial career==
===Bordeaux===
On 8 June 2007, Blanc was named the new manager of Bordeaux, replacing Brazilian Ricardo Gomes. For his first season on the bench, he led the club to second place in Ligue 1 and won the Manager of the Year award. His second Ligue 1 season was extremely successful. Bordeaux won the final 11 league matches of the 2008–09 Ligue 1 season, setting a new French record for consecutive wins, to clinch the Ligue 1 title three points clear of Olympique de Marseille. Bordeaux also won the 2008–09 Coupe de la Ligue. Blanc was again nominated for Manager of the Year but lost to Marseille manager Eric Gerets.

In the 2009–10 Champions League campaign, Blanc&#x27;s Bordeaux topped a group featuring Juventus and Bayern Munich without losing a match. After defeating Olympiacos in the Round of 16, they were eliminated by fellow French side Lyon in the quarter-finals.

===France===
On 16 May 2010, Blanc confirmed his departure from Bordeaux after three seasons in charge of the French outfit. After resigning from his position, Blanc contacted the French Football Federation (FFF) to inquire about the France national team job, which was eventually vacated by Raymond Domenech following the 2010 World Cup. Later that day, FFF President Jean-Pierre Escalettes confirmed that Blanc was a candidate for the position. On 18 May 2010, with Blanc&#x27;s appointment to the position becoming more probable, Bordeaux chairman Jean-Louis Triaud demanded compensation from the Federation. On 20 May 2010, the club reached an agreement with the FFF for €1.5 million. On 26 June, French media confirmed that Blanc had signed a two-year contract with the Federation to lead the team to Euro 2012. The deal was finalised a week later and Blanc was officially named as manager of the team on 2 July.

As he took charge of France, the Federation had decided to suspend all 23 players who took part in the South African World Cup, much to Blanc&#x27;s regret. On 11 August, in his first game as manager, France lost 2–1 to Norway at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. However, Blanc&#x27;s team soon managed to top their Euro 2012 qualifying group while also achieving friendly wins over England, Brazil and Germany. France&#x27;s first match in Group D of Euro 2012 was against England and ended in a 1–1 draw, after Samir Nasri scored to cancel out a goal scored by Joleon Lescott. France then went on to win their second match 2–0 against Ukraine. They advanced to the quarter-finals by finishing in second position in Group D, despite losing to Sweden 2–0 in their final group match. France were defeated 2–0 by the defending champions Spain in the quarter-final match. Blanc stepped down as manager of the national team on 30 June 2012 and was replaced by former France captain and teammate Didier Deschamps.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
Blanc was appointed manager of Paris Saint-Germain on 25 June 2013 shortly after previous manager Carlo Ancelotti left for Real Madrid. On 3 August, Blanc won his first trophy with the club, the 2013 Trophée des Champions, defeating Bordeaux 2–1 in the Stade d&#x27;Angondjé in Libreville, Gabon, coming from behind with late goals from Hervin Ongenda and Alex. A second item of silverware was won on 19 April 2014, as two goals from Edinson Cavani defeated Lyon 2–1 in the 2014 Coupe de la Ligue Final. PSG&#x27;s European campaign ended in the quarter-finals of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League with elimination by Chelsea on away goals. On 7 May 2014, after nearest rivals Monaco drew with Guingamp, PSG won the league, despite losing to Rennes later that day in the match in which they celebrated their triumph. The following day, Blanc was given a one-year contract extension to 2016, with club President Nasser Al-Khelaifi saying: &quot;We are very happy with his results this season, as well as the very attractive football the team has played. We are convinced we will win a lot more trophies together.&quot;


Blanc&#x27;s second season in charge began with victory in the 2014 Trophée des Champions against Guingamp at the Workers&#x27; Stadium in Beijing. On 11 April 2015, PSG retained the Coupe de la Ligue with a victory over Bastia in the final, with Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimović scoring two goals each in a 4–0 victory. PSG won the Ligue 1 title for the third consecutive year on 16 May 2015 with a 2–1 victory at Montpellier. On 11 February 2016, Blanc signed a two-year contract extension. PSG reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth consecutive year after dispatching Chelsea in the round of 16, but lost to Manchester City in the quarter-finals. Blanc was criticised by the French media after the Champions League quarterfinal second-leg match against Manchester City, where he had surprised many by having his team play in an untried 5–3–2 formation that backfired completely. On 21 May 2016, PSG defeated Marseille 4–2 in the 2016 Coupe de France Final. PSG thus won the Ligue 1–Coupe de France–Coupe de la Ligue domestic treble for the second consecutive season and equalled Marseille&#x27;s all-time record of ten Coupe de France titles. On 3 June 2016, when asked for his assessment of the season during an interview given to the newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, PSG&#x27;s president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi described the 2015–2016 season as a failure because of PSG&#x27;s elimination from the Champions League by Manchester City at the quarter-final stage, and stated that changes would be made before the following season and a new cycle would begin. On 27 June 2016, PSG announced that Blanc and assistant coach Jean-Louis Gasset had left the club by mutual agreement that &quot;preserved the interests of both parties&quot;, noting that Blanc had &quot;left a significant mark on the great history of Paris Saint-Germain&quot;. The French sports daily &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; reported that Blanc would receive a severance deal worth 22 million euros.

===Al-Rayyan===
On 19 December 2020, Blanc was appointed as the head coach of Qatari club Al-Rayyan, replacing Uruguayan Diego Aguirre.

On 13 February 2022, he was terminated because of poor results and replaced by Nicolás Córdova.

===Lyon===
On 9 October 2022, Blanc was appointed as the manager of French club Lyon. He replaced outgoing Dutch manager Peter Bosz. He was sacked by OL on 8 September 2023, after losing three of their four opening games, leaving them in last place.

===Al-Ittihad===
On 13 July 2024, Blanc was appointed as the head coach of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad, replacing Argentine Marcelo Gallardo.

<text>The New Democratic Party of New Zealand was a small political party established in 1972. It was a splinter group from the better-known Social Credit Party.

==History==
It was founded by former Social Credit leader John O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien was considered a powerful and energetic orator, but had a controversial and aggressive leadership style, and alienated many of his followers. After being replaced as leader by Bruce Beetham, O&#x27;Brien quit the Social Credit Party with his deputy Tom Weal and established his own group. The party&#x27;s Dominion chairman was Patrick McMullan of Dunedin who, ironically, had stood against O&#x27;Brien for the Social Credit leadership in 1970. In the 1972 election, the New Democrats fielded eighty-six candidates (including Wilfrid Owen), but did not win any seats. The New Democrats won 0.63% of the vote, compared with 6.65% for Social Credit. O&#x27;Brien himself stood in the Nelson electorate placing last of five candidates with only 2.97% of the vote.

The party was still in existence in 1975 and was considering standing candidates at the 1975 election. However the party did not end up standing any candidates.

O&#x27;Brien later sued the Social Credit Party in 1980 for defamation regarding a statement of claim against him in an article published in &quot;The Nelson Mail&quot; in 1972. A four and a half day trial was held at the Nelson courthouse where the jury found against O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s $50,000 case, determining that the words in the article in question were not published to readers with authority from the party and nor did the paper infer that it was.

<text>Campaign for National Parks (CNP) – formerly the Council for National Parks and the Standing Committee on National Parks – is an independent UK registered charity promoting the National Parks of England and Wales for the public benefit.

Their vision is: Nature-rich National Parks for everyone.

Their mission is: To inspire action for wilder, inclusive National Parks.

Campaign for National Parks brings together a Council of around 40 environment and access groups, indirectly representing over 4 million people with an interest in National Parks.

==History==
In 1936 a group of individuals and voluntary organisations, including representatives from Ramblers, YHA, CPRE and CPRW, met for the first time to start a campaign for the establishment of National Parks in Britain. Under the name The Standing Committee on National Parks they set out an ambitious agenda, that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy the finest countryside, and that these landscapes should be protected permanently. 

Following government legislation enabling the designation of National Parks in 1949, the role of the Standing Committee changed. It concentrated on strengthening the powers and funding of National Parks, and being vigilant in monitoring proposals which would undermine their natural beauty and enjoyment by all. In 1977 it became the Council for National Parks, and in June 2008 changed to its current name. 

== Charitable objectives ==
The Campaign for National Parks&#x27; charitable objectives are;

* To promote the protection, conservation and enhancement of National Parks for public benefit;
* To promote the quiet enjoyment of National Parks and the appreciation of their natural beauty by the public in an informed and understanding manner;
* To advance public education in and understanding of National Parks, through the provision of educational material and by other means;
* To promote and undertake research into issues affecting the conservation and enjoyment of National Parks and to make public the useful results of any such research.

== Activities ==
Campaign for National Parks brings together a campaigning collective to advocate for protected landscapes in national and devolved governments, and champions people and organisations working to protect National Parks. Their key campaigning focuses are better protections for National Parks, equal access to National Parks and the creation of more National Parks.

=== Research ===
Campaign for National Parks sponsors and undertakes research relating to their charitable objectives and campaigning work. 

Key reports;

* National Parks and the Climate Emergency 2021
* Raising the bar: improving nature in our National Parks 2018

<text>The Anichini family were Italian Renaissance sculptors, leading carvers of engraved gems for seals and medals in Renaissance Italy.

Francesco Anichini (–1526) had four sons who followed him in the art. He was the leading gem-cutter in Venice, taking commissions from Isabella d&#x27;Este and others.

His sons were: 
*Alvise Anichini (dates uncertain)
*Andrea Anichini (–1553)
*Callisto Anichini ( 1527–), a jewelry-maker,
*Luigi Anichini ( 1500  1510, after 1559) Michelangelo pronounced his &quot;Interview of Alexander the Great with the high-priest at Jerusalem&quot; &quot;the perfection of the art&quot;. His medals of Henry II of France and Pope Paul III are greatly valued.
