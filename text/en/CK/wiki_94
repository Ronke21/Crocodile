<text>Benjamin Aaron Shapiro (born January 15, 1984) is an American conservative political commentator, media proprietor, and attorney. He writes columns for Creators Syndicate, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;Ami Magazine&quot;, and serves as editor emeritus for &quot;The Daily Wire&quot;, which he co-founded in 2015. Shapiro is the host of &quot;The Ben Shapiro Show&quot;, a daily political podcast and live radio show. He was editor-at-large of &quot;Breitbart News&quot; from 2012 until his resignation in 2016. Shapiro has also authored sixteen non-fiction books.

== Early life and education ==
Shapiro was born on January 15, 1984, in Los Angeles, California, to a Conservative Jewish family. He is Ashkenazi Jewish. When he was 9 years old, his family began to observe Orthodox Judaism. He started playing violin at a young age and performed at the Israel Bonds Banquet in 1996 at age 12. His parents both worked in Hollywood. His mother was a TV company executive, and his father, David Shapiro, worked as a composer.

Skipping two grades (third and ninth), Shapiro went from Walter Reed Middle School in The Valley to Yeshiva University High School of Los Angeles in Westside, Los Angeles, where he graduated in 2000 at age 16. He studied political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 2004 at age 20 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he studied under liberal law professors Lani Guinier and Randall Kennedy. In 2007, Shapiro graduated from Harvard with a Juris Doctor, &quot;cum laude&quot;.

Shapiro is one of four children, and his parents&#x27; only son.

== Career ==
===Law===
After graduating from law school, Shapiro entered private practice at the law firm Goodwin Procter, but left after 10 months. , he ran an independent legal consultancy firm, Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting, in Los Angeles.

=== Author ===
Shapiro became interested in politics at a young age. He started a nationally syndicated column when he was 17, becoming the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the United States, and had written two books by age 21.

In his first book &quot;Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America&#x27;s Youth&quot; (2004), Shapiro argues that the American Left has ideological dominance over universities and that professors do not tolerate non-left opinions.

In 2011, HarperCollins published Shapiro&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV&quot;, in which Shapiro argues that Hollywood has a left-wing agenda that it actively promotes through prime-time entertainment programming. In the book, the producers of &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; say they pursued a pro-pacifist, anti-Vietnam-War agenda in those series. Shapiro also became a fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

In 2013, Threshold Editions published Shapiro&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;Bullies: How the Left&#x27;s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans&quot;.

In 2017, he released his first and to date only fiction novel, &quot;True Allegiance&quot;.

In 2019, Shapiro published the book &quot;The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great,&quot; which focuses on the importance of Judeo-Christian values and laments the decline of those values in modern America.

In 2021, Shapiro published the book &quot;The Authoritarian Moment&quot;, which argues that there is not a pressing authoritarian threat in U.S. politics from the right-wing. Rather, he argues that the authoritarian threat comes from the left&#x27;s control of academia, Hollywood, journalism, and corporate America.

=== &quot;Breitbart News&quot; ===
In 2012, Shapiro became editor-at-large of &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, a website founded by Andrew Breitbart. After &quot;Breitbart&quot; came under the leadership of Steve Bannon, Shapiro attempted to distance himself from him.

On February 7, 2013, Shapiro published an article citing unspecified Senate sources who said that a group named &quot;Friends of Hamas&quot; was among foreign contributors to the political campaign of Chuck Hagel, a former U.S. Senator awaiting confirmation as Secretary of Defense as a nominee of President Barack Obama, but weeks later &quot;Slate&quot; reporter David Weigel reported there was no evidence such a group existed. Shapiro told Weigel that the story he published was &quot;the entirety of the information [he] had.&quot; Shapiro later expressed regret over publishing the story.

In March 2016, Shapiro resigned from his position as editor-at-large of &quot;Breitbart News&quot; following what he characterized as the website&#x27;s lack of support for reporter Michelle Fields in response to her alleged assault by Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump&#x27;s former campaign manager, in spite of video and eyewitness evidence of the assault. In his resignation statement, Shapiro stated, &quot;Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out [the late Breitbart.com founder] Andrew Breitbart&#x27;s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump&#x27;s personal Pravda&quot;. After Shapiro&#x27;s departure, &quot;Breitbart&quot; published a piece, falsely attributed to Shapiro&#x27;s father&#x27;s pseudonym, saying, &quot;Ben Shapiro betrays loyal Breitbart readers in pursuit of Fox News contributorship,&quot; which &quot;Breitbart&quot; later deleted. Despite being critical of Bannon, Shapiro defended Bannon when he was accused of antisemitism.

=== Host ===
In 2012, Shapiro joined KRLA-AM 870 as a host on their morning radio program alongside Heidi Harris and Brian Whitman. By 2016, he was one of the hosts for KRLA&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Answer&quot;, a conservative radio show. Internal emails showed that Shapiro faced pressure from Salem Media executives, the syndicate that owned the show, to be more supportive of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Shapiro, however, remained highly critical of Trump throughout the election.

Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing founded &quot;The Daily Wire&quot; on September 21, 2015. He serves as editor emeritus as well as the host of his online political podcast &quot;The Ben Shapiro Show,&quot; broadcast every weekday. , the podcast was ranked by Podtrac as the second most popular podcast in the U.S. Westwood One began syndicating &quot;The Ben Shapiro Show&quot; podcast to radio in April 2018. In 2018, &quot;Politico&quot; described the podcast as &quot;massively popular&quot;. In January 2019, Westwood One expanded Shapiro&#x27;s one-hour podcast-to-radio program, adding a nationally syndicated two-hour live radio show, for three hours of Ben Shapiro programming daily. As of March 2019, according to Westwood One, &quot;The Ben Shapiro Show&quot; is being carried by more than 200 stations, including in nine of the top ten markets. In June 2020, Shapiro stepped down from his role as editor-in-chief, which he had held since the site&#x27;s founding, and took on the role of editor emeritus.

In September 2018, Shapiro started hosting &quot;The Ben Shapiro Election Special&quot; on Fox News. The limited-run series covered news and issues relating to the 2018 midterm elections.

Shapiro has made frequent appearances on PragerU with talks on intersectionality and Hollywood with 4,900,000 to 8,400,000 views .

In 2021, Ben Shapiro&#x27;s podcast was ranked as the 9th most listened on Apple podcasts.

=== Speaker ===

Shapiro speaks at college campuses across the United States. In his speeches, he often presents a conservative viewpoint on controversial subjects. He spoke at 37 campuses between early 2016 and late 2017.

Some students and faculty members at California State University, Los Angeles objected to a speech that Shapiro, who was then an editor at Breitbart News, was scheduled to hold at the university on February 25, 2016, titled &quot;When Diversity Becomes a Problem&quot;. University president William Covino canceled the speech three days before it was to take place, with the intention of rescheduling it so that the event could feature various viewpoints on the subject of campus diversity. Covino ultimately reversed his decision, allowing the speech to go on as planned. The day of the speech, student protesters formed human chains, blocking the doors to the event and staging sit-in protests. When Shapiro began his speech, a protester pulled the fire alarm. After the speech ended, Shapiro was escorted out by campus police. Conservative youth organization Young America&#x27;s Foundation (YAF) announced it was filing a lawsuit against the university (with Shapiro as one of the plaintiffs), claiming that the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the students were violated by Covino&#x27;s attempted cancellation of the event as well as by the physical barricading of students from entering or leaving the event.

In August 2016, DePaul University revoked an invitation for Shapiro to address students at the school and barred him from entering the campus owing to &quot;security concerns&quot;.

On September 14, 2017, Shapiro gave a speech at the invitation of the University of California, Berkeley student organization Berkeley College Republicans (BCR) in which he criticized identity politics. The event was supported by the YAF and BCR. It involved a large police presence, which had been promised by Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ in her August letter that supported free speech. Together, the university and the city of Berkeley spent $600,000 () on police and security for the event, which transpired with nine arrests but no major incidents.

=== Other media activities ===
On October 7, 2013, Shapiro and business partner Jeremy Boreing co-founded the U.S. media criticism website TruthRevolt with funding from the David Horowitz Freedom Center. TruthRevolt ceased operations in March 2018.

On January 14, 2021, Shapiro was featured as a guest writer for &quot;Politico&quot; Playbook newsletter, where he defended House Republicans who opposed the second impeachment of Donald Trump. The newsletter drew immense backlash from many &quot;Politico&quot; staffers, some of whom argued that Shapiro should not have been allowed to write the article. Matthew Kaminski, editor-in-chief of &quot;Politico&quot;, refused to apologize and defended the decision to allow Shapiro to write the article, stating that, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to back away from having published something because some people think it was a mistake to do so.&quot; According to the &quot;Daily Beast&quot;, more than 100 &quot;Politico&quot; staffers signed on to a letter to publisher Robert Allbritton criticizing both &quot;Politico&#x27;s&quot; decision to feature Shapiro&#x27;s article and the response from Kaminski.

Shapiro cameoed in &quot;The Daily Wire&quot; film, &quot;Lady Ballers&quot;, that was released December 1, 2023. He portrayed a referee.

On January 26, 2024, he appeared alongside artist Tom MacDonald in the music video for MacDonald&#x27;s rap song &quot;Facts&quot;, which Shapiro is featured on. The song held the No. 1 spot on iTunes Music in late January &amp; early February 2024. On February 5, 2024, the song debuted at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.

== Views ==

In 2012, &quot;Zman Magazine&quot; hailed Shapiro as a &quot;rising star in America&#x27;s conservative movement&quot;. In 2016, Shapiro described himself as &quot;basically a libertarian&quot;. In 2021, he described himself as &quot;generally libertarian&quot; with regard to the role of the government and as a conservative with regard to the role of social structures. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Haaretz&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot; have described Shapiro as &quot;right-wing&quot;. Shapiro&#x27;s views have been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;extremely conservative&quot; and was described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as a &quot;radical conservative&quot; and as a &quot;classically religious-conservative&quot;. A 2020 study &quot;News, Nationalism, and Hegemony: The Formation of Consistent Issue Framing Throughout the U.S. Political Right&quot; examining issue framing by right-wing podcasts used &quot;The Ben Shapiro Show&quot; as an example which &quot;offered a mainstream conservative perspective that favors President Donald Trump and his framing on issues like &#x27;nationalism&#x27;&quot; in a two-by-two matrix that also examined a Stormfront podcast, an alt-right podcast, and the Daily Standard podcast; the study argued that Shapiro&#x27;s rhetoric was similar to that used in the Stormfront podcast, though with a different tone.

Shapiro has described the political left as believing in an imaginary &quot;hierarchy of victimhood&quot; in which the opinions of members of persecuted groups like the LGBT community are afforded more credence. He has argued that the left has dominated American culture through popular entertainment, media, and academia in a way that has made conservatives feel disenfranchised and helped lead to the election of Donald Trump in 2016. He has stated that &quot;political correctness breeds insanity&quot;. Shapiro is an outspoken opponent of safe spaces, especially those on college campuses, arguing that they go against free speech. Shapiro frequently praises Western culture and Western civilization, saying &quot;I believe Western civilization is superior to other civilizations.&quot;

=== Abortion ===

Shapiro supports a ban on abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, with one exception: when competent medical authority determines that the life of the mother is in jeopardy as a result of the pregnancy. He has further clarified that this includes extreme cases of mental illness where the life of the mother is at risk due to suicide. He also believes that doctors who perform abortions should be prosecuted. He has referred to women who have abortions as &quot;baby killers.&quot; In 2019, Shapiro asserted that &quot;the Supreme Court overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;&quot; was &quot;not going to happen&quot;, and added that he had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about &quot;whether the Supreme Court, as currently constituted, would vote to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;&quot;.

In 2019, Shapiro spoke at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., where he said abortion is a &quot;violent act&quot;.

=== Alt-right ===
Shapiro is a critic of the alt-right movement, stating in 2017, &quot;It is a garbage movement composed of garbage ideas. It has nothing to do with constitutional conservatism.&quot; In 2019, Shapiro criticized weekly newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; for describing him as &quot;alt-right&quot; in their interview with him; in response, &quot;The Economist&quot; issued an apology and modified the article title to instead describe Shapiro as a &quot;radical conservative&quot;.

Shapiro has been a target of online harassment and antisemitic threats from the alt-right. After leaving Breitbart News, Shapiro was a frequent target of antisemitic rhetoric from the alt-right. According to a 2016 analysis by the Anti-Defamation League, Shapiro was the most frequent target of antisemitic tweets against journalists.

=== Capital punishment ===
Shapiro is an advocate of capital punishment and &quot;strongly&quot; supports it remaining legal in the United States. Explaining his beliefs, Shapiro has stated that, &quot;You can forfeit the right to life if you take another life, just as you can forfeit your right to liberty (this is called prison) by infringing on the liberty of another&quot;.

=== Climate change ===
Shapiro has acknowledged climate change as a legitimate phenomenon, although he has questioned &quot;what percentage of global warming is attributable to human activity.&quot; In relation to concerns over increased flooding of coastal property from sea-level rise as a result of climate change, Shapiro stated, &quot;You think people aren&#x27;t just going to sell their homes and move?&quot; Writing for GQ, in response to that remark, Jay Willis adds, &quot;The possibility that no market will exist for property that is literally underneath the ocean seems not to have occurred to him.&quot; In an opinion piece on the 2020 California wildfires, Shapiro argued that state policies had contributed more to the severity of the fires than climate change. In response, &quot;Scientific American&quot; accused Shapiro of promoting climate change denial. In 2021, he stated that a global temperature increase of 4 °C (7.2 °F) did not amount to an emergency, and that describing it as one was &quot;purely a political designation&quot;.

=== Donald Trump ===
In the spring of 2016, Shapiro wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Wire&quot; in which he stated he would &quot;never vote for Donald Trump&quot;. Shapiro supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 presidential election and opposed Trump&#x27;s candidacy. In August 2016, Shapiro wrote an article for the Daily Wire arguing that Trump, if elected, would not appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court. He described Steve Bannon as a &quot;bully&quot; who &quot;sold out Breitbart founder Andrew Breitbart&#x27;s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.&quot; Shapiro has stated that Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 election was more of a vote against Hillary Clinton than a vote in favor of Trump.

Shapiro supported the Trump administration&#x27;s ordering of the killing of Qasem Soleimani, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, as well as the nominations of Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Shapiro also supported Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, cutting regulations, and his nomination of 12 appellate court judges. However, Shapiro criticized Trump for firing James Comey, for appointing Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon, and for endorsing Roy Moore.

On October 19, 2020, Shapiro announced that he would be voting for Trump in the 2020 presidential election: &quot;There are three reasons I&#x27;m going to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 when I didn&#x27;t four years ago: First, I was simply wrong about Donald Trump on policy. Second, I wasn&#x27;t really wrong about Donald Trump on character, but whatever damage he was going to do has already been done, and it&#x27;s not going to help if I don&#x27;t vote for him this time. And third, and most importantly: The Democrats have lost their fucking minds.&quot; He rebuked Trump on election night, November 3, 2020, when Trump prematurely claimed himself the winner when neither he nor his opponent Joe Biden had yet reached the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. He tweeted: &quot;No, Trump has not already won the election, and it is deeply irresponsible for him to say he has.&quot; Shapiro denounced the false claim that Trump was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. He criticized the January 6 Capitol attack whilst also criticizing the Democratic Party&#x27;s response to it. In 2024, during 2024 Republican primaries, Shapiro favored Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over Trump but later supported Trump after DeSantis dropped out of the primary. Shapiro also later helped host a fundraiser for Trump. In October 2024, Shapiro interviewed Trump on his show.

=== Economics and social security ===

In March 2024, Shapiro attracted criticism when he stated on his show that &quot;No one in the United States should be retiring at 65 years old. Frankly, I think retirement itself is a stupid idea unless you have some sort of health problem.&quot;

Shapiro has backed privatizing Social Security, and for lowering taxes on the very wealthy. In August 2022, Shapiro argued that &quot;Marxism can&#x27;t work in America,&quot; saying this was because of &quot;high levels of societal income mobility&quot;.

=== Facebook ===
In 2018, Shapiro argued that Facebook was targeting conservative sites after the platform implemented an algorithm change, limiting their traffic, and that they are not transparent enough. In 2021, an article in NPR revealed that, under Shapiro&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Daily Wire&quot; had dominated Facebook news feeds and received more engagement than any other news outlet &quot;by a wide margin&quot;.

=== Gender and sexuality ===
In 2010, Shapiro argued that homosexuality should not have been removed as a mental illness from the DSM because homosexuals have higher rates of depression than heterosexuals and do not reproduce. In 2014, Shapiro argued that the United States &quot;is not a country that discriminates against homosexuals&quot; and that &quot;there is a vastly minute amount of discrimination against gays in this country.&quot;

Shapiro opposed the &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; Supreme Court ruling that deemed bans of same-sex marriage unconstitutional. However, he opposes government involvement in marriage, saying, &quot;I think the government stinks at this,&quot; and expressing concern that because of the ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, at some point the government may try to force religious institutions to perform same-sex weddings against their will. According to &quot;Slate&quot;″s Seth Stevenson, Shapiro has described homosexuality as a sin. Shapiro also opposes same-sex couples raising children. He has said that &quot;a man and a woman do a better job of raising a child than two men or two women&quot;.

He has stated he does not feel same-sex marriage should be taught to students in schools, saying, &quot;In California, they&#x27;ve already passed laws that you have to teach same-sex marriage in public schools, for example... I went to public school for elementary school and junior high, I don&#x27;t know why the government is teaching me anything about this stuff. This is for my parents to teach me. This is a values thing.&quot; He also states, &quot;I&#x27;m very much anti gay-marriage in the social sense. As a religious person, I think homosexuality is a sin, I think that lots of things are sins that people engage in, I think they should be free to engage in them.&quot;

Shapiro believes transgender people suffer from mental illness. He has commented, &quot;You can&#x27;t magically change your gender. You can&#x27;t magically change your sex,&quot; and has compared such changes to the notion of changing one&#x27;s age or identifying as an animal.

In July 2015, Shapiro and transgender rights activist Zoey Tur were on &quot;Dr. Drew On Call&quot; to discuss Caitlyn Jenner&#x27;s receipt of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. After Shapiro referred to Tur, who is a trans woman, as &quot;sir&quot; and questioned her genetics, she placed her hand on the back of his neck and threatened on air to send him &quot;home in an ambulance&quot;. Shapiro replied, &quot;That seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.&quot; Later, Shapiro filed a police report accusing Tur of battery and stated that he intended to press charges to &quot;teach the left a lesson&quot;. Tur said the report was Shapiro&#x27;s attempt to keep the story in the news.

In 2019, in response to 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate Beto O&#x27;Rourke calling for the removal of the tax-exempt status of religious institutions opposed to same-sex marriage, Shapiro said that if O&#x27;Rourke was going to try to &quot;indoctrinate&quot; his children in religious schools, Shapiro would be forced to either &quot;leave the country&quot; or &quot;pick up a gun.&quot;

=== Gun ownership ===
Following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Shapiro appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; on January 10, 2013. On the issue of gun control, Shapiro called Piers Morgan a &quot;bully&quot; who &quot;tends to demonize people who differ from you politically by standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook, saying they don&#x27;t seem to care enough about the dead kids.&quot; Videos of the encounter quickly received millions of views and went viral.

Writing in October 2017, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Shapiro argued that &quot;banning all guns would be unwise as well as immoral,&quot; additionally Shapiro stated, &quot;...here&#x27;s the problem: Not a single gun law short of full-scale gun confiscation would have prevented Las Vegas or any of the other mass shootings we&#x27;ve seen. Furthermore, there is no correlation between states with high rates of gun ownership and states with high rates of gun homicide.&quot;

=== Healthcare ===
Shapiro has backed repealing the Affordable Care Act. In 2021, Shapiro said that he was in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine and that he was vaccinated, but is against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
In 2003, Shapiro published a column on &quot;Townhall&quot; stating that Israel must be allowed to &quot;transfer Palestinians and Israeli-Arabs from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel proper.&quot; Citing expulsion of Germans after World War II as a precedent, Shapiro insisted that &quot;expelling a hostile population is a commonly-used and generally effective way of preventing violent entanglements.&quot; In the same article, Shapiro said that &quot;The ideology of the Palestinian population is indistinguishable from that of the terrorist leadership.&quot; Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg criticized Shapiro&#x27;s comments as an example of his &quot;fascist&quot; views. Shapiro later reversed his view on the West Bank issue, saying it was &quot;both inhumane and impractical&quot;.

In 2010, Shapiro said &quot;Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage&quot;. He later stated that he was talking about the Israeli and Arab leadership, as well as terrorist groups in Palestine.

In a 2008 &quot;Townhall&quot; opinion piece, Shapiro expressed support for Israel&#x27;s settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.

In 2019, Shapiro said that Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose comments about American support for Israel were accused of evoking antisemitic tropes, and the white supremacist San Diego shooter, hold &quot;a lot of the same opinions about Jews.&quot;

During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Shapiro published an op-ed in &quot;The Marshall News Messenger&quot; in which he stated that the reason behind the conflict between Israel and Hamas is that &quot;Israel exists, and Hamas wishes it didn&#x27;t exist&quot;. Shapiro additionally stated that Hamas&#x27;s rocket attacks &quot;would entail an anti-Semitic genocide&quot;, adding that Hamas was spending &quot;tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid&quot; on building &quot;terror tunnels and rocket capacity to strike at the Jews.&quot; Shapiro argued that Hamas was positioning its rockets in civilian areas, seeking to &quot;force Israel to kill Palestinian civilians so Hamas can propagandize about supposed Israeli human rights atrocities.&quot; He stated that Hamas was killing not only Jews but also Israeli Arabs and foreign workers. He also criticized the media coverage of the crisis, labeling it as &quot;absurd&quot; and specifically criticized &quot;The New York Times&quot; for its opinion article featuring a Palestinian writer titled &quot;The Myth of Coexistence in Israel&quot;. Shapiro stated that an image used in the article, a map of Israel, was &quot;so bad that MSNBC, which used the image in 2015, had to retract it and admit it was factually incorrect.&quot;

In an October 2024 appearance co-sponsored by The Daily Wire and the Young American&#x27;s Foundation at the University of California, Los Angeles, when asked whether or not he&#x27;d condone the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces and Netanyahu-led Israeli government amidst the deaths of over 40,000 people in and near the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israel–Hamas war, including the killing of children, Shapiro stated he &quot;doesn&#x27;t just condone [their] actions, I celebrate and laud them&quot;. In the same statement, he claimed that the Israeli government has gone through &quot;such extraordinary efforts not to kill civilians&quot; that they have managed to have &quot;the best civilian-to-terrorist kill ratio in the history of urban warfare&quot;.

=== Military policy ===
In a 2002 article, Shapiro wrote, &quot;I am getting really sick of people who whine about &#x27;civilian casualties&#x27;... when I see in the newspapers that civilians in Afghanistan or the West Bank were killed by American or Israeli troops, I don&#x27;t really care&quot;. Shapiro declared that &quot;One American soldier is worth far more than an Afghan civilian&quot;, accusing Afghan civilians of being &quot;fundamentalist Muslims&quot; who provide cover for terrorists or give them money. Shapiro later apologized for these comments, stating that the 2002 article was &quot;just a bad piece, plain and simple, and something I wish I&#x27;d never written&quot;. He said that while he still partially agreed with his article&#x27;s main point—&quot;that we must calculate the risk to American services members when we design rules of engagement&quot;—he &quot;expressed [that point] in the worst possible way, and simplified the issue beyond the bounds of morality (particularly by doubting the civilian status of some civilians)&quot;.

Shapiro supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that &quot;China is a dictatorship. North Korea is a dictatorship. Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Egypt are all dictatorships. We can&#x27;t overthrow all of those regimes simply to free their citizens. We have to focus on those regimes that endanger American security.&quot;

=== Race ===
Shapiro has stated that, while African-Americans were historically victims of injustice in the United States, he does not believe in the existence of widespread systemic injustice today. In 2017, Shapiro stated that &quot;the idea that black people in the United States are disproportionately poor because America is racist; that&#x27;s just not true.&quot; Shapiro has dismissed the idea that the United States was founded on slavery and argued that America was founded in spite of slavery.

Shapiro was one of several conservative commentators condemning Representative Steve King (R-IA) after King&#x27;s January 2019 comments in defense of the terms &quot;white supremacy&quot; and &quot;white nationalism&quot;. Shapiro called for King to be censured, and supported King&#x27;s 2020 primary challenger Randy Feenstra.

Shapiro has criticized Black Lives Matter and has stated that &quot;the Black Lives Matter movement did indeed begin with protests about police brutality but quickly morphed into broader debates over the validity of looting and rioting, tearing down historic statues, slavery reparations and defunding the police.&quot;

After the trial of Derek Chauvin, where police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of the murder of George Floyd, Shapiro stated that Chauvin should not have been found guilty of murder, and instead opined that Floyd died of a drug overdose rather than as a result of Chauvin&#x27;s actions.

=== Religion ===
Shapiro practices Orthodox Judaism, which he states informs his ideological positions. Shapiro wears a &quot;yarmulke&quot;, the traditional Jewish skullcap. In a 2011 tweet, Shapiro claimed that Judaism is plagued by &quot;Bad Jews&quot; who &quot;largely vote Democrat&quot;. The same year, he wrote an article titled &quot;Jews in Name Only&quot; in which he claimed &quot;Jews who vote for Obama are, by and large, Jews In Name Only (JINOs)&quot; and that such Jews &quot;do not care about Israel&quot; or that they &quot;care about it less than abortion, gay marriage and global warming&quot;. During the 2016 presidential election, he wrote an article titled &quot;No, It Doesn&#x27;t Matter That Bernie Sanders Is Ethnically Jewish. He&#x27;s a Jew In Name Only.&quot; Despite being a practicing Jew, he has expressed admiration for Christianity and its role in the building of Western civilization.

In October 2022, Shapiro condemned Kanye West&#x27;s antisemitic comments, comparing them to propaganda in Nazi Germany. He also called West &quot;unstable&quot;.

In a 2014 YouTube video entitled &quot;The Myth of the Tiny Radical Muslim Minority&quot;, Shapiro said, &quot;We&#x27;re above 800 million Muslims who are radicalized – more than half the Muslims on earth. That&#x27;s not a minority... the myth of the tiny radical Muslim minority is just that: it&#x27;s a myth&quot;. PolitiFact and &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; in the UK rejected his methodology, arguing that support for Sharia law was not sufficient to label an individual a &quot;radical Muslim&quot;, and that &quot;The meaning of Sharia law varies from sect to sect and nation to nation.&quot; &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; also criticized his use of polls with small sample sizes as accurately representing the views of tens of millions of Muslims, though acknowledged that &quot;some polls do show that very illiberal values and concepts can be prevalent in some Muslim countries&quot;.

In the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting, six Muslims were killed by Alexandre Bissonnette. Police presented evidence that Bissonnette checked Shapiro&#x27;s Twitter feed 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting. Shapiro condemned the attack and said he did not incite the shooting.

=== United States politics ===
In 2006, Shapiro called for sedition laws to be reinstated. He cited speeches critical of the George W. Bush administration by Democrats Al Gore, John Kerry and Howard Dean as &quot;disloyal&quot; and seditious. Shapiro retracted these views in a 2018 column, stating that his 2006 column &quot;absolutely blows. It&#x27;s garbage&quot; and adding that the idea of sedition laws was &quot;inherently idiotic&quot;. Shapiro later described President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2010 State of the Union Address as &quot;philosophically fascist.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 2008, Shapiro married Mor Toledano, an Israeli medical doctor of Moroccan descent, and they lived in Los Angeles. The couple has two daughters and two sons. They practice Orthodox Judaism.

In September 2020, Shapiro announced that he and his family were leaving California. While he relocated the headquarters of his &quot;Daily Wire&quot; enterprise to Nashville, Tennessee, he and his family resettled in Florida.

Shapiro&#x27;s sister, Abigail Shapiro, who studied operatic singing, is a conservative media influencer who posts videos on her YouTube channel &quot;Classically Abby&quot;. She has been subjected to online antisemitic trolling due to her brother&#x27;s high public profile.

Shapiro is a cousin of Mara Wilson.

<text>The davul, dhol, tapan, atabal or tabl is a large double-headed drum that is played with mallets. It has many names depending on the country and region. These drums are commonly used in the music of the Middle East and the Balkans. These drums have both a deep bass sound and a thin treble sound due to their construction and playing style, where different heads and sticks are used to produce different sounds on the same drum.

Additionally, other names for the daouli, depending on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the (); this word exists in English in the word tympani for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and the tympanic membrane for the eardrum.

==Traditional uses==
In the southern Balkans, the rhythm of the tapan is complex and utilizes many accents in numerous traditional time signatures. In Macedonia, tapans are most often used to accompany other instruments such as the zurla and gaida, while in Bulgaria they usually accompany gaida and gadulka. They are also played solo in some Albanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian folk dances and songs. For centuries the tapan is irreplaceable at Bulgarian village festivities such as weddings and celebrations of patron saints of homes and villages. In Romania and Moldova the toba is sometimes used to accompany dances. In the regions of Moldavia, Maramures and Bihor there are also some varieties with a small cymbal mounted on top. They are generally struck with a wooden mallet on one skin and with a thinner stick on the rim or cymbal.

In Armenia, Turkey, Kurdistan, and Azerbaijan, the dhol/davul is most commonly played with the zurna, a wind instrument, although it can be played with other instruments and in ensembles as well. It has also traditionally been used for communication and for Turkish mehter, or janissary music. In Iraq and the Levant, it is predominantly used in Assyrian folk dance and Assyrian folk/pop music, among Assyrian people, which are mostly accompanied by a zurna. In Armenia, the dhol does not have as large of a circumference and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped drumstick is also used sometimes. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music, usually along with other drums such as the dap, the dmblak, and native woodwinds such as the tsiranapogh, the sring, the shvi, the , the parkapzuk (Armenian bagpipe), and some stringed instruments like the , the , the and some of foreign origin, like the Iranian kamancha and the Arabic oud. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.

==Construction==

The drum shell is made of hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use depending on the region where the drum is made. To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. Rope threaded back and forth across the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.

In the former Yugoslavian republics and Bulgaria, the tapan is made in two dimensions, , at about 50 – 55 cm diameter, and or tapanche, at about 30 – 35 cm diameter.

In Turkey, davuls typically range in size from 60 cm to 90 cm in diameter. Cow hide is used for the bass pitch drum head side, while goat skin is used for the thin, high pitched side.

In Greece, daouli can be 12 to 14 inches for the toumbi up to 3 to 4 feet for daouli. Commonly the drum is about 20 to 30 inches.

==Playing style==
Players often use a rope hooked to the drum to hold the drum sideways, so that one head is accessible with the left hand and one with the right. Each hand is usually dedicated to playing one side of the drum exclusively, though this can vary by local style and tradition.

Drummers of this drum typically uses two kinds of sticks. The drummer plays the accented beats with the dominant hand on the side of the drum with the thicker skin, using a special stick known as the , , or (daouli stick). This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440 mm long, which is often made with walnut. Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound. Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum. Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand on the side of the drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called , , or (daouli switch). This thin stick is often held cross-grip, and the drummer can quickly hit thin accent strokes by gently twisting the wrist. These thin sticks are often made from soft wood such as willow or cornel.

The Balkan school of tapan playing presumes the playing (not the accompaniment) of a melody, where the non-dominant hand is used to express all that the player wishes to say, while the dominant hand is only used to accentuate certain moments in the melody.

<text>Daisy Fuentes (born November 17, 1966) is a Cuban-American model, television host, actress and former weather presenter. Fuentes became MTV&#x27;s first Latina VJ (signed to MTV and MTV Latin America simultaneously) and Revlon&#x27;s first Latina spokesperson to be signed to a worldwide contract.

==Early life and education==
Daisy Fuentes was born on November 17, 1966, in Havana, Cuba, to a Cuban father and Spanish mother. In 1969, when Fuentes was three years old, her family fled the country to escape Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime and moved to Madrid, Spain. Four years later, she moved with her family to Harrison, New Jersey, US, where she attended Harrison High School, was voted homecoming queen and &quot;best looking&quot;, and graduated in 1984. An aspiring hairstylist, she enrolled in cosmetology school with dreams of opening her own salon. Later, she enrolled at Bergen Community College where she majored in communications.

==Career==
While still a college student, Fuentes was hired to present the weather at WNJU-TV 47, the local affiliate of Spanish-language TV network, Telemundo. Shortly after, Fuentes took a position with New York&#x27;s Univision affiliate WXTV-TV 41 where in addition to being the weather anchor, she reported for the evening news.

In 1988, in addition to her weather duties, Fuentes hosted &quot;MTV Internacional&quot;, a one-hour Spanish language music show that aired in Latin America and the U.S. on Telemundo Network which made her well known in the Spanish-language TV market in the U.S. and Latin America. Fuentes joined MTV in 1993, becoming the first Latina VJ in the U.S., while also hosting shows for MTV Latin America. While at MTV Fuentes was also a host of the fashion and modeling series, &quot;House of Style&quot;. She became one of that network&#x27;s more popular hosts and soon was courted by companies to be a spokesmodel. She later landed a role on the ABC soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;. Fuentes appeared on shows such as &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, and &quot;Cybill&quot;. From 1994 to 1995 she hosted her own talk show, &quot;Daisy&quot;, on CNBC.

<doc id="1147910" wikidata="Q1132442" url="?curid=1147910" title="Great rite">
<text>The great rite is a Wiccan ritual involving symbolic sexual intercourse with the purpose of drawing energy from the powerful connection between a male and female. Both receive more power. It is an uncommon ritual in a full coven, as it is used when the coven is in need of powerful spiritual intervention. 
Most often it is performed by the high priest and priestess of a coven, but other participants can be selected to perform the rite. 

==Symbolic version of the great rite==
In the symbolic version the high priestess plunges the athame, or ritual knife that represents the masculine, into a cup or chalice which represents the feminine. The chalice is filled with wine and is held by the high priest. The great rite symbolizes creation in the union of the maiden goddess with the lover god, and thus is also known as a fertility rite.
==Occasions for the great rite==
A variety of ritual occasions call for the great rite to be performed, such as during the festival of Beltane on or about May 1 in the northern hemisphere and November 1 in the southern hemisphere.

<doc id="1147911" wikidata="Q7679836" url="?curid=1147911" title="Talking Points Memo">
<text>Talking Points Memo (TPM) is a liberal political news and opinion website created and run by Josh Marshall that debuted on November 12, 2000. The name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a &quot;talking points memo&quot; that was often discussed during the Clinton-era Monica Lewinsky scandal. By 2007, &quot;TPM&quot; received an average of 400,000 page views every weekday.

== Growth ==
&quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; was founded as a political blog in 2000 by Josh Marshall, who until 2004 was the site&#x27;s sole employee. In 2005, TPM Media LLC was incorporated, and the company began to grow with more employees and spinoff websites. By 2009 it had 11 employees, and, having previously been funded by ads and reader donations, received angel investments from a group led by Marc Andreessen. In 2009, &quot;TPM&quot; opened a Washington, D.C. office and joined the White House press pool along with several other progressive news outlets to cover the Obama administration. The site introduced a subscription service, TPM Prime, in 2012, which by 2017 had over 21,000 subscribers, and by December 2020 had nearly 35,000 subscribers.

==Reception==
Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols describe the site as taking a &quot;more raucous and sensational&quot; tone than traditional news media. This includes coining phrases such as &quot;Bamboozlepalooza&quot; to describe George W. Bush&#x27;s efforts to privatize Social Security, which the blog opposed; and &quot;bitch-slap politics&quot; to refer to the Swiftboating of 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry.

McChesney and Nichols compare the site&#x27;s style to the muckraking of Upton Sinclair. The more social aspects of the site, which invite crowdsourcing, were compared to &quot;La Follette&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, in 2009 said &quot;&quot;TPM&quot; is really an advocacy operation that has moved toward journalism.&quot;

Guest bloggers have included Matthew Yglesias, Robert Reich, Dean Baker, Michael Crowley, and, briefly, vice-presidential candidate John Edwards. Beginning in the summer of 2006, many weekend postings were provided by anonymous blogger &quot;DK&quot;. On November 11, 2006, &quot;DK&quot; was revealed to be attorney David Kurtz, who now posts openly under his name.

In 2007, &quot;TPM&quot; won a George Polk Award for Legal Reporting for its coverage of the 2006 U.S. Attorneys scandal, becoming the first online-only outlet to receive the award.

Sargent had begun writing for TPMCafe in July 2006. In 2008, Sargent stopped posting to the &quot;Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; blog and began posting to a new blog called TPM Election Central, which focused on covering the 2008 elections. In 2009, TPM Election Central was renamed TPMDC, to cover politics from Washington, D.C., and Marshall hired journalists based in Washington to report for the blog.

<text>A couta boat is a type of sailing vessel originally designed and built in Victoria, Australia, around the fishing ports of Sorrento and Queenscliff, and along Victoria&#x27;s west coast as far west as Portland. Mostly used from around 1870 until the 1930s, the couta boat survived as a commercial fishing vessel until the 1950s. From the 1970s onwards, a community of enthusiasts started restoring old couta boats to use recreationally.

== History ==

=== As a fishing vessel ===
The couta boat was developed for the coastal fishing industry during the later part of the 19th century. It was particularly used to catch the fish &quot;Thyrsites atun&quot;, locally called the &quot;barracouta&quot;, a confusion with the larger ocean barracuda. The boats headed out to the fishing grounds before dawn, most often through the infamous and often treacherous Rip, the entrance to Port Phillip, where the boats’ qualities of seaworthiness were proven. 

Although load-carrying capacity was important, the need for speed under sail was also a desired characteristic. Fishing cooperatives established quotas to control prices, which led to the added requirement of speed in a good boat. Once their quota of &quot;barracouta&quot; was met, the fishermen sailed back to port as fast as they could — the first boat back got the best prices.

The typical couta boat carried a gaff sail and jib, set out on a long bowsprit, although the mainsail developed into more of a gunter sail, because it had a very high-peaked gaff or yard. A rig peculiar to the couta boat evolved, which allowed for sail to be carried much higher than previously, and included a distinctive downward-curved bowsprit.

As efficient and competitive commercial fishing vessels, couta boats reached their peak in the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, the development of boat engines, and the growing preference for shark, began lessening the importance of couta boats.

=== As a recreational sailing boat === 
The couta boat became a victim of the modernisation of the fishing industry after World War II, and survives due only to the efforts of a small group of individuals with a sense of history and an admiration for maritime tradition. Regretting the apparent inevitability that the distinctive boats would become a footnote in Australia’s seafaring history, from the late 1970s onwards, a few dedicated people sought and restored remaining couta boats that were either still afloat or propped up in backyards along the coast.

Couta boats are highly sought after and keenly compete in races. Many are built new because the supply of originals has been exhausted. There is a couta boat club in Sorrento and another in Queenscliff.

==Early Example==
&quot;Thistle&quot;, one of the oldest surviving examples of a couta boat, was designed and built in Victoria by J.R. Jones, in about 1903. She was purchased in 1987 and restored by Tim Phillips for the Australian National Maritime Museum, and went on display in 1990.

<text>Barbara Joan Branden (née Weidman; May 14, 1929 – December 11, 2013) was a Canadian-American writer, editor, and lecturer, known for her relationship and subsequent break with novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand.

==Life==
Born in Winnipeg, Barbara Weidman met Nathaniel Branden because of their mutual interest in Ayn Rand&#x27;s works. They became personal friends of Rand in 1950, and when they married in 1953, Rand and her husband, Frank O&#x27;Connor, served as the matron of honor and best man. She earned her M.A. in philosophy, and authored a thesis on free will, under the direction of Sidney Hook at New York University. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden became founding members of an Objectivist movement that sought to advance Rand&#x27;s ideas.

In 1954, Nathaniel Branden began a secret romantic affair with Rand with the reluctant permission of both spouses. This relationship continued for three years. While their respective spouses, Barbara Branden and Frank O&#x27;Connor, had knowledge of the affair and nominally accepted it, Branden later said it led to &quot;years of pain&quot; and &quot;enormous harm&quot;, describing it as a &quot;sacrifice&quot;.

Barbara and Nathaniel Branden co-wrote &quot;Who Is Ayn Rand?&quot; in 1962. Barbara Branden&#x27;s essay in the book was the first biography of Rand. When it was written, Rand considered Barbara Branden to be one of the most important proponents of Objectivism.

She served as the executive director of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, and gave a series of lectures on &quot;Principles of Efficient Thinking.&quot;

In 1968, when Rand terminated her association with Nathaniel Branden after she discovered that he had become involved with actress Patrecia Scott more than four years earlier, she likewise disassociated herself from Barbara Branden for keeping this fact from her. The details of these events remain controversial.

In 1986, Barbara Branden published another biography of Rand, &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot;. The book, written after Rand&#x27;s death in 1982, caused a rift among Rand&#x27;s followers because it not only stated that Rand and Nathaniel Branden had been lovers, but that Rand had broken with them when she learned of his affair with Scott. Rand had previously claimed that the friendship broke up over other matters, but letters in her estate confirmed Barbara Branden&#x27;s version of the cause. The book was made into an Emmy Award-winning motion picture in 1999 starring Helen Mirren as Rand, Eric Stoltz as Branden and Julie Delpy playing Barbara.

She contributed the lead essay &quot;Ayn Rand: The Reluctant Feminist&quot; to the anthology &quot;Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand&quot;, wherein she argued that the way Rand lived her life made it a feminist manifesto, even as Rand had disagreements with feminism. Barbara Branden was estranged from her cousin Leonard Peikoff, Rand&#x27;s chosen intellectual and legal heir after Rand&#x27;s break with Nathaniel Branden.

Barbara Branden died of a lung infection in Los Angeles on December 11, 2013. Branden had no children.

<text>Edwin Henry Cheney (June 13, 1869 — December 18, 1942) was an American electrical engineer from Oak Park, Illinois, United States.

He was the son of James Wilson Cheney and Armilla Armanda, daughter of Linus S. and Rebekah J. (Jaegger) Perkins. His father was born in Royalton, Massachusetts, and moved to Maine with his parents ca. 1850. James W. entered Oberlin College in 1860 before enlisting in the 7th Ohio Infantry in April 1861. After his marriage to Armilla Perkins on May 27, 1868, he moved from Shelbyville, Illinois to Detroit in 1870, where he engaged in manufacturing tool-handles and other specialty items. Edwin&#x27;s adopted sister, Luella Emory Cheney, was born April 11, 1871.

Cheney was born in Shelbyville and grew up in Detroit, attending the public schools there. He attended the University of Michigan, graduating in 1892 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Electrical Engineering. Upon graduation, he moved to Chicago to begin his career with the Chicago Edison Co. (now known as Commonwealth Edison). He worked in various areas throughout his career, including electrical contracting and construction, steam heating, and fuel engineering. He held a U.S. patent for an improved boiler setting.

He married fellow University of Michigan alumnus Mamah Borthwick on June 15, 1899, at the Borthwick family home in Oak Park. They had two children, John and Martha.

Cheney commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build his family a home in Oak Park, now called the Edwin H. Cheney House. Wright engaged in a love affair with Mamah Cheney, with whom he went to Europe in 1909. Upon their return, Mamah moved into Taliesin, the new house Wright was building for them, while it was still under construction. Mamah and Edwin Cheney were divorced in 1911. A year later, Edwin married Elizabeth Meller, a schoolteacher friend of Mamah&#x27;s sister Lizzie Borthwick.

On August 15, 1914, a domestic servant at Taliesin named Julian Carlton killed Mamah Borthwick, along with John and Martha Cheney, who happened to be visiting (Edwin Cheney had primary custody). Four others were also murdered during this event.

After the murder of his biological children, Cheney and his second wife adopted 3 more children. They moved to Webster Groves, Missouri in 1926, following Cheney&#x27;s promotion to Vice President of Sales for the Wagner Electric Corporation. He had begun work for Wagner in 1909 as its Chicago district manager. He worked for Wagner until his death.

==Categories==
===Indigenous music===

Oklahoma is the traditional homeland of the Caddo, Wichita, and Tonkawa peoples. The US federal government&#x27;s Indian Removal policy of the 19th century moved many other tribes into the area, and now the state is headquarters to 40 federally recognized tribes. Oklahoma is diverse crossroads of Native American musicians. This rich collection of traditional music is performed in powwows all over the state. Additionally, the music is enriched by Indian musicians&#x27; exposure to other tribe&#x27;s songs through the many intertribal meetings in the state. The American Indian Exposition in Anadarko is a longstanding gathering of Southern Plains Tribes featuring many musicians. Among Eastern tribes, stomp dances feature male singers with accompaniment by women&#x27;s turtle shell leg rattles.

49 songs, a 20th-century genre based on traditional war dance songs, originated in Oklahoma among the Kiowa tribe in southwestern Oklahoma and quickly spread to other tribes through the American Indian Exposition at Anadarko. The name comes from a burlesque show that toured the area in the 1920s called the &quot;Girls of &#x27;49&quot; for its California Gold Rush theme. A 49 (or forty-nine) is a gathering following a pow-wow and the songs are usually love songs, mostly in English, with repeated refrains of vocables.

===Barbershop===
The Barbershop Harmony Society&#x27;s Southwestern District includes Oklahoma, with several barbershop chapters across the state. In 1999, the Music Central chorus from Oklahoma City competed internationally, ranking among the top twenty. Sweet Adelines International has several women&#x27;s choruses across Oklahoma within its Heart of America region. Both of these international singing organizations were founded in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

===Country===
The traditional Appalachian folk ballads brought by new settlers from the South infused Oklahoma with a music about the lives of everyday people. Much of the music was overtly religious as the rural communities revolved around their churches. Another distinctive type of country music grew out of the dance halls and roadhouses, especially in the oil boom areas of eastern Oklahoma. This honky-tonk style music from Oklahoma and the surrounding states became a staple of American country music for years.

===Gospel===
Oklahoma has had a long tradition of Gospel music. &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; and &quot;Steal Away To Jesus&quot;, standard Gospel tunes, were written by Wallis Willis, a former slave in the old Choctaw Nation of southeastern Oklahoma. Alexander Reid, a minister at a Choctaw boarding school after the Civil War, transcribed the words and melodies and sent the music to the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Jubilee Singers then popularized the songs during a tour of the United States and Europe. Albert E. Brumley, a Spiro, Oklahoma native, wrote a number of Gospel classics that have become a standard in Gospel singer&#x27;s repertoires. His best-known compositions include &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away,&quot; &quot;Jesus Hold My Hand,&quot; and &quot;Turn Your Radio On.&quot; These songs are commonplace in many church hymnals today.

===Jazz and swing===

The territory bands of the 1920s and 30s brought a new style of music to Oklahoma. Many of the well-known swing musicians tuned their skills and styles touring with these regional bands. These bands brought the big-band orchestras to many communities never visited by the more popular groups from New York. Perhaps the most famous of the Oklahoma-based territory bands were the Oklahoma City Blue Devils. The Blue Devils were the foundation for Count Basie&#x27;s orchestra. The Al Good Orchestra, also from Oklahoma City, began playing in the Oklahoma area in the 1940s and continue to play after Al Good&#x27;s death in 2003. Bandleader Ada Leonard was born in Lawton. In addition, a number of prominent jazz musicians came from Oklahoma; these include Charlie Christian, Oscar Pettiford, Don Byas, Cecil McBee, Barney Kessel, Sam Rivers, Don Cherry, Chet Baker, Jimmy Rushing, Sunny Murray, and Jay McShann. Although most of these self-identified as African American, many (including Pettiford) were also partly of Native American ancestry.

===R&amp;B===
R&amp;B singer, drummer, and bandleader Roy Milton was born in Wynnewood. Guitarist and bandleader Jimmy Liggins was born in Newby. Pianist and vocalist Joe Liggins was born in Guthrie.

===Rock and roll===
One of the hot spots for rock and roll in Oklahoma during the 60&#x27;s was Ronnie Kaye&#x27;s &quot;The Scene&quot; in Oklahoma City. It featured local garage rock and psychedelic bands. Musicians such as songwriter J. J. Cale, Elvin Bishop, and Leon Russell have ties to Tulsa, Oklahoma (&quot;see The Tulsa Sound&quot;), and Tulsa&#x27;s Cain&#x27;s Ballroom has become a notable small-venue club for touring bands. After the success of cult icons The Flaming Lips, under-the-radar act Starlight Mints, and 90&#x27;s alternative groups Chainsaw Kittens and The Nixons, Norman has become a hotspot for local and nationwide indie music. Pop-rock band Hanson, who had a string of hits in the mid-90s, hails from Tulsa; as do Admiral Twin, and Caroline&#x27;s Spine. Alternative-rock band The All-American Rejects was formed in Stillwater; and post-grunge band Hinder, notable for their hit &quot;Lips of an Angel&quot; hails from Oklahoma City. The 1990s had a Hardcore Punk Rock scene in Edmond, Oklahoma which included bands such as The Lunch Bunch, Blaster, The Real Ones, Bi-Products, Aspects, Suburban Bitches, Dry Heave, The Takers, The Boxcar Children, and many more who played shows at the Edmond Legion Hall, the Edmond Armory, The Outback, Hafer Park and The Sheep Farm.

===Western or cowboy===
Prior to Oklahoma&#x27;s opening for settlement, cowboys pushing cattle from Texas to the railheads developed a style and subject of music that became known as Cowboy or Western. As they settled on the ranches they continued their traditional style of singing. The romanticism of the cowboy in the popular culture brought a wider audience to the music. Although the writers of these traditional Western songs are mostly unknown, Dr. Brewster Highley, author of perhaps the most famous of the cowboy ballads, &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, followed the frontier into Oklahoma where he died in 1911.

Otto Gray and his Oklahoma Cowboys were the first nationally popular cowboy band. Formed in 1924 by William McGinty, Oklahoma pioneer and former Rough Rider, the band performed on radio and national vaudeville circuits from 1924 through 1936. Otto Gray, the first singing cowboy, and all of the band members were recruited from Oklahoma ranches.

===Western Swing===
Oklahoma was a center for the development and spread of Western swing. Performers playing the traditional western music, influenced heavily by the territory bands, added fiddles and steel guitars to their orchestras to produce a new and very popular type of music. Bob Wills, and His Texas Playboys, based in Tulsa, influenced this music for more than a generation. One of the more distinctive early Western swing bands from Oklahoma was Big Chief Henry&#x27;s Indian String Band, a family group of Choctaw Indians, who performed out of Wichita, Kansas, during the 1920s, and who were recorded by H. C. Speir of Victor Records in 1929. Bob Dunn was a pioneer steel guitarist born in Beggs.

==Radio==
In 1922, WKY began broadcasting in Oklahoma City. Other stations followed and soon, anyone with a radio could hear music previously unavailable to them. Still, many radios broadcast local music. KVOO in Tulsa aired Western swing from Bob Wills for more than twenty years.

In 1958, KOMA, a 50,000 watt radio station in Oklahoma City, began a format of playing &quot;Top 40&quot; recordings and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Its signal strength allowed many young people across the Great Plains and Western states to listen to music not available from their local stations and influenced many of their local music markets.

Oklahoma currently supports many radio stations. Most play music that ranges from classical to hip-hop. Much of their content, however, is taped and the same programs broadcast over several stations throughout the U.S. Very little local music is aired. &quot;(See List of radio stations in Oklahoma)&quot;

== Oklahoma Music Archives ==
Founded in 2019, the Oklahoma Music Archives is a not-for-profit cultural website whose mission is to preserve the past, present, and future of Oklahoma&#x27;s music culture. The archive is a database of current and past artists who are from Oklahoma or have strong ties to the state as well as albums released by those artists and biographies for individual musicians. Its database spans all genres and all decades, including any known artists predating statehood.

As a wiki, the website is dynamic and ever expanding with more articles of interest relating to the Oklahoma music scene, due in part to user input. It is the largest public database of musical artists and albums specific to Oklahoma and also has plans to expand to include venues and studios, historical and current, as well as provide resources to assist artists.

<doc id="1147947" wikidata="Q2118845" url="?curid=1147947" title="ESPNcricinfo">
<text>ESPNcricinfo (formerly known as Cricinfo or CricInfo) is a sports news website exclusively for the game of cricket. The site features news, articles, live coverage of cricket matches (including liveblogs and scorecards), and &quot;StatsGuru&quot;, a database of historical matches and players from the 18th century to the present. , Sambit Bal was the editor.

The site, originally conceived in a pre-World Wide Web form in 1993 by Simon King, was acquired in 2002 by the Wisden Grouppublishers of several notable cricket magazines and the Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack. As part of an eventual breakup of the Wisden Group, it was sold to ESPN, jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and Hearst Communications, in 2007.

==History==
CricInfo was launched on 15 March 1993 by Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota. It grew with help from students and researchers at universities around the world. Contrary to some reports, Badri Seshadri, who was very instrumental in CricInfo&#x27;s early growth, did not become involved in CricInfo until some months after its founding.

The site was reliant on contributions from fans around the world who spent hours compiling electronic scorecards and contributing them to CricInfo&#x27;s comprehensive archive, as well as keying in live scores from games around the world using CricInfo&#x27;s scoring software, &quot;dougie&quot;. In 2000, Cricinfo&#x27;s estimated worth was $150 million; however it faced difficulties the following year as a result of the dotcom crash.

Cricinfo&#x27;s significant growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during the peak of the dotcom boom, and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around £100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about £6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies.

In 2000, Cricinfo was named title sponsor of the Women&#x27;s World Cup.

By late 2002 the company was making a monthly operating profit and was one of very few independent sports sites to avoid collapse (such as Sports.com and Sportal). However, the business was still servicing a large loan. Cricinfo was eventually acquired by Paul Getty&#x27;s Wisden Group, the publisher of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; and &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot;, and renamed Wisden Cricinfo. The Wisden brand (and its own wisden.com site) were eventually phased out in favour of Cricinfo for Wisden&#x27;s online operations. In December 2005, Wisden re-launched its recently discontinued &quot;Wisden Asia Cricket&quot; magazine as &quot;Cricinfo Magazine&quot;, a magazine dedicated to coverage of Indian cricket. The magazine published its last issue in July 2007.

In 2006, revenue was reported to be £3m.

In 2007, the Wisden Group began to be broken up and sold to other companies; BSkyB acquired &quot;The Wisden Cricketer&quot;, while Sony Corporation acquired the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system. In June 2007, ESPN Inc. announced that it had acquired Cricinfo from the Wisden Group. The acquisition was intended to help further expand Cricinfo by combining the site with ESPN&#x27;s other web properties, including ESPN.com and ESPN Soccernet. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

As of 2023, Sambit Bal is the editor-in-chief of ESPNcricinfo. In 2013, ESPNcricinfo.com celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a series of online features. The website awards the annual ESPNcricinfo Awards.

On 20 March 2023, ESPNcricinfo celebrated its 30th anniversary by an article from Sambit Bal, its editor-in-chief.

==Popularity==
ESPNcricinfo&#x27;s popularity was demonstrated on 24 February 2010, when the site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual score in a men&#x27;s One Day International match with 200*.

==Features==
ESPNcricinfo contains various news, columns, blogs, videos and fantasy sports games. Among its most popular feature are its liveblogs of cricket matches, which includes a bevy of scorecard options, allowing readers to track such aspects of the game as wagon wheels and partnership breakdowns. For each match, the live scores are accompanied by a bulletin, which details the turning points of the match and some of the off-field events. The site also used to offer &quot;Cricinfo 3D&quot;, a feature which utilizes a match&#x27;s scoring data to generate a 3D animated simulation of a live match.

Regular columns on ESPNcricinfo include &quot;All Today&#x27;s Yesterdays&quot;, an &quot;On this day&quot; column focusing on historical cricket events, and &quot;Quote Unquote&quot;, which features notable quotes from cricketers and cricket administrators. &quot;Ask Steven&quot; is a weekly column, published on Tuesdays, in which Steven Lynch answers users&#x27; questions on all things cricket. Furthermore, &quot;The Light Roller&quot; and &quot;The Briefing&quot; contain satire on cricket&#x27;s recent events.

Among its most extensive features is &quot;StatsGuru&quot;, a database originally created by Travis Basevi, containing statistics on players, officials, teams, information about cricket boards, details of future tournaments, individual teams, and records. In May 2014, ESPNcricinfo launched CricIQ, an online test to challenge every fan&#x27;s cricket knowledge.

In September 2021, ESPNCricinfo launched AskCricinfo, a natural language search tool to help in exploring cricket stats.

==&quot;The Cricket Monthly&quot;==
&quot;The Cricket Monthly&quot; claims to be the world&#x27;s first digital-only cricket magazine. The first issue was dated August 2014.

<doc id="1147948" wikidata="Q230378" url="?curid=1147948" title="Catherine Keener">
<text>Catherine Ann Keener (born March 26, 1959) is an American actress. She has portrayed disgruntled and melancholic yet sympathetic women in independent films, as well as supporting roles in studio films. She has been nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, for &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999) and for her portrayal of author Harper Lee in &quot;Capote&quot; (2005). Her performance as Gertrude Baniszewski in &quot;An American Crime&quot; (2007) earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. Her other accolades include nominations for a BAFTA Award and two Golden Globe Awards.

Keener also starred in live-action roles in the films &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; (2005), &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), &quot;Get Out&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2024), as well as starring voice roles in &quot;The Croods&quot; (2013), its sequel &quot;The Croods: A New Age&quot; (2020), and &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018). Keener is the muse of director Nicole Holofcener, having appeared in each of Holofcener&#x27;s first five films. She also appeared in each of director Tom DiCillo&#x27;s first four films, and three films directed by Spike Jonze. From 2018 to 2020, she starred in the Showtime dramedy series &quot;Kidding&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Keener is of Irish descent on her father&#x27;s side, and of Lebanese descent on her mother&#x27;s. Keener was raised in Hialeah, Florida as a Catholic and attended Catholic schools. She attended Monsignor Edward Pace High School.

Keener&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth Keener, is also an actress and a real estate agent working for Sotheby&#x27;s in Los Angeles.

Keener attended Wheaton College, in Norton, Massachusetts. She majored in American Studies, also enrolling in a theater course. Her first theatrical production was the Wendy Wasserstein play &quot;Uncommon Women and Others&quot;, during her junior year at Wheaton. She graduated with her Bachelor of Arts from Wheaton College in 1983.

==Career==
Keener had a supporting role as Lt. Cricket Sideris in the television series &quot;Ohara&quot;. The series ran from January 1987 to May 1988.

Her first film appearance was one line in &quot;About Last Night...&quot; (1986). Although she struggled professionally over the next few years, one project had an unexpected dividend: Keener met her future husband, actor Dermot Mulroney, in 1987 while working on &quot;Survival Quest&quot; (1989), after Mulroney became stuck while attempting to scale a cliff.

She also guest starred as an artist on an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; called &quot;The Letter&quot;. She played Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend, an artist who painted a famous portrait of Kramer. Keener then earned her first starring role, in &quot;Johnny Suede&quot;, with the then-unknown Brad Pitt. Her performance gained critical acclaim and earned her first Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead. She went on to work with director Tom Dicillo again, in &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; (1995). Two years later, she was once again nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in &quot;Walking and Talking&quot;, an independent cult-comedy film directed by Nicole Holofcener.

In 2000, Keener earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, directed by Spike Jonze. In 2001, she worked with director Nicole Holofcener in &quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot;, garnering her a third Independent Spirit Award nomination. In 2002, she co-starred with Edward Norton in the off-Broadway revival of &quot;Burn This&quot; and the film &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;. She also took part in the film &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, and &quot;Simone&quot; alongside Al Pacino.

In 2005, she starred in the political thriller &quot;The Interpreter&quot; (as a Secret Service agent partnered with Sean Penn&#x27;s character) and &quot;The Ballad of Jack and Rose&quot; with Daniel Day-Lewis and played the love interest of Steve Carell in Judd Apatow&#x27;s &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;. Keener&#x27;s performance as writer Harper Lee in &quot;Capote&quot; (also 2005) earned her several awards and nominations, including her second Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 2006, she starred in the film &quot;Friends with Money&quot;, directed by Nicole Holofcener.

In 2007, Keener played Jan Burres in Sean Penn&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, based on Jon Krakauer&#x27;s best-selling book of the same name. In 2008, her film &quot;An American Crime&quot;, the true story of Gertrude Baniszewski, a middle-aged mother who tortured and murdered Sylvia Likens in her Indiana home, was aired on Showtime. Keener played Baniszewski and her portrayal earned her an Emmy nomination in the Best Actress in a TV Mini-Series or Movie category. In 2008, Keener portrayed Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s wife Adele in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;. She and Hoffman again played husband and wife in the 2012 film &quot;A Late Quartet&quot;. Keener played the title character&#x27;s mother in the 2010 film &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;, based on the series of books by Rick Riordan.

Keener starred in the six-episode HBO miniseries &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot;, based on the 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by Lisa Belkin. It aired in August 2015. In 2016, Keener starred in the independent film &quot;Unless&quot;.

In 2017, Keener starred as Missy Armitage in the racially themed horror film &quot;Get Out,&quot; which was a critical and commercial success.

Keener starred in the 2021 Netflix horror drama miniseries &quot;Brand New Cherry Flavor&quot;.

In 2024, Keener appeared in &quot;&quot;, the sequel to the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;.

== Acting style and reception ==
Throughout her career, Keener has developed a reputation for succeeding in complex roles, often portraying desolate, bittersweet women &quot;who come across as empty or unfulfilled in their relationships or their creative endeavors&quot;, effortlessly earning sympathy from audiences in both protagonist and antagonist roles. Director Rebecca Miller said that Keener is &quot;very good at playing disgruntled&quot;, a designation about which Keener explained, &quot;Anger is not a bad thing&quot;; she finds comfort in playing roles of this nature because &quot;It doesn&#x27;t go hand in hand with the mode of behaviour that&#x27;s ladylike or proper or dignified.&quot; Nate Williams of ComingSoon.net deemed Keener &quot;one of the most interesting performers in the game&quot; as of 2019 due to her willingness &quot;to embrace different roles&quot;, describing her as &quot;A dramatic actor with no problem playing strange characters&quot;.

Keener gravitates towards roles in independent films, and opts for smaller character roles on rare occasions when she agrees to appear in larger studio ventures, which &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Missy Schwartz believes &quot;she inhabits more comfortably than flashier ones.&quot; Amanda McCorquodale, contributing to the &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, wrote that Keener regularly plays smart, neurotic women in independent films, likening her body of work to Woody Allen heroines. Rotten Tomatoes crowned Keener &quot;one of the queens of 1990s American independent cinema&quot;, while &quot;The Independent&quot; called her &quot;A darling of the independent film world&quot;. Despite commending her diverse yet carefully cultivated roles, &quot;The Independent&quot; observed that most of Keener&#x27;s studio roles have &quot;barely registered&quot; among critics and audiences. Williams believes that Keener&#x27;s skillset and versatility have allowed her to work with some of the industry&#x27;s best filmmakers. Schwartz wrote that directors such as Neil LaBute (&quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot;, 1998) and Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Full Frontal&quot;, 2002) have consistently &quot;put her unusual beauty and trademark dry wit to good use.&quot;

Keener seldom gives interviews, believing that overexposure &quot;becomes a dirty business&quot;. The actress is known for being notoriously press-shy, and refuses to refer to herself as &quot;famous&quot; despite her success in the film industry. In 2010, &quot;Inside Jersey&quot; contributor Stephen Whitty observed that, throughout a decade of interviewing the actress, Keener had always been open to commenting about her collaborators, both directors and co-stars, but often refused to be interviewed about herself, considering her a shy person who values her privacy. In 2014, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; journalist T&#x27;Cha Dunlevy selected Keener as his most memorable interview of the year, during which he admitted to mostly remembering laughing. Dunlevy described the actress as &quot;a consummate pro who has brought charisma and soul to projects ranging from&quot; goofball comedies to blockbuster films. Keener has continued to enjoy a reputation &quot;as a both charming and well respected actress&quot;.

==Personal life==
Keener married actor Dermot Mulroney in 1990. They have a son, Clyde, born in 1999, who is a singer. Mulroney filed for divorce in June 2007, citing irreconcilable differences and the divorce became final on December 19, 2007.

<text>The Lotte Giants () are a South Korean professional baseball team based in Busan. They are a member of the KBO League. The Lotte Giants are owned by Lotte Corporation.

From 1982 through 1985, they played at Gudeok Baseball Stadium and since then have played at Sajik Baseball Stadium. They have won the Korean Series twice, in 1984 and 1992. The team drew about 1.38 million spectators during the 2009 season, a record which remains as the highest attendance in a single season in any South Korean sports league. They are often called the Busan Seagulls () because the official bird of the city of Busan is the seagull, and their main fight song is Moon Seung-jae&#x27;s &quot;Busan Seagulls&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Lotte Giants were founded as an amateur baseball team of the Korea Baseball Association in Seoul, South Korea, on 6 May 1975. On 22 February 1982, the Giants became professional and moved to Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea.

=== 1980s ===
The Lotte Giants made their KBO League debut against the Haitai Tigers at Gudeok Baseball Stadium on 28 March 1982. They defeated the Tigers 14–2, but finished the year in fifth place out of six teams with a .388 winning percentage. Choi Dong-won, Ryu Du-yeol and Sim Jae-won of the South Korea national baseball team postponed joining the Giants to play for the country in the 1982 Amateur World Series, held in Seoul.

In 1984, the Giants won their first Korean Series title in the third season after the KBO League was launched. They beat the Samsung Lions 4–3 in the Korean Series. They were led by Choi Dong-won, one of the most dominant pitchers in the Korea Professional Baseball league, who finished the 1984 season with 27 wins, 223 strikeouts, and a 2.40 ERA and won the regular season MVP Award. In the 1984 Korean Series, he appeared in five out of seven games, had a 4–1 record (one shutout, three complete games, and one five-inning relief appearance), and pitched 40 innings in ten days.

The Giants made one of the biggest trades in KBO League history after the 1988 season when they sent their star pitcher Choi Dong-won and Kim Yong-chul to the Samsung Lions, and received hitter Jang Hyo-jo and pitcher Kim Si-kin.

=== 1990s ===
The Giants made it back to the Korean Series in 1995 and 1999, losing both times. They have not appeared in the Korean Series since 1999.

=== 2000s ===
From 2001 to 2007 the Giants did not qualify for the postseason, finishing in last place for four consecutive years (2001–2004). In mid-2001, the Giants&#x27; manager Kim Myung-seong, who had been in charge of the team since 1998, died of a heart attack. He was replaced by Woo Yong-deuk.

Late in 2007, the Giants signed American Jerry Royster to become the manager of the Giants, making him the first-ever non-Korean to take the helm of one of South Korea&#x27;s professional baseball clubs. Royster served as the Giants&#x27; manager through the 2010 season, guiding the team to the playoffs in all three seasons.

== Popularity and attendance ==
The Giants are one of the most popular teams in the Korea Baseball Organization. According to a Gallup Korea&#x27;s survey conducted in 2011, the Giants were voted as the most popular team three times in a row. In 1991, they became the first Korean team to attract more than one million spectators to their home games during a season. In the 2009 season, they set the all-time record of home attendance of 1,380,018 fans. In the 2011 season, they also led the league in the total home attendance with 1,358,322 fans at 67 home games. The average attendance was 20,273 fans per game, meaning the stadium was 71% full on average per game. From 2008 to 2012, they drew over 1 million fans for five consecutive seasons.

== Season-by-season records ==

==Team==
=== Current roster ===
=== Retired numbers ===
The club&#x27;s first retired number is Choi Dong-won&#x27;s squad number 11. Described as one of the top pitchers in the Korea Professional Baseball league, he played for the Giants between 1983 and 1988, and won the KBO MVP award in 1984. Choi died of cancer in 2011. In 2022, the club retired the number 10 in honour of Lee Dae-ho, who spent more than 15 seasons with the Giants.

<text>The Victoria cricket team is an Australian first-class men&#x27;s cricket team based in Melbourne, Victoria. The men’s team, which first played in 1851, represents the state of Victoria in the Marsh Sheffield Shield first-class competition and the Marsh One Day Cup 50-over competition. 

It was known as the Victorian Bushrangers between 1995 and 2018, before dropping the Bushrangers nickname and electing to be known as simply Victoria in all cricket competitions. Victoria shares home matches between the Melbourne Cricket Ground in East Melbourne and the Junction Oval in St Kilda. The team is administered by Cricket Victoria and draws its players primarily from Victoria&#x27;s Premier Cricket competition along with players from throughout the country. Victoria also played in the now-defunct Twenty20 competition, the Twenty20 Big Bash, which was replaced by the franchise-based Big Bash League.

The Victorian cricket team is the second-most successful state team in Australian first-class cricket, having won 32 Sheffield Shield titles, the most recent of which was in the 2018–19 season. The Victorians have also claimed six One-Day Cups and four Big Bash tiles.

== History ==

The team&#x27;s origins date back to the very start of Australian cricket when the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) was formed in 1838, and in that same year an MCC team played its first match against the Victorian Military. However, the first official inter-colonial (now interstate) game was contested between Port Phillip and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1851, in Launceston.

Victoria was the dominant force in the early days of Australian first-class cricket, winning two of the first three Sheffield Shield tournaments, and most of its early domestic friendly games against the other states. The first game between the great rivals Victoria and New South Wales was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in 1856.

The annual Sheffield Shield tournament first began in the 1892/93 season, contested by Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Victoria won that tournament by defeating both opponents twice each. During the history of the Shield, Victoria has won the competition 32 times, most recently in the 2018/19 season.

The Victorian Cricket Association, now Cricket Victoria, was founded in 1895 and since March 2018 has been based at its headquarters, the CitiPower Centre in St Kilda.

Victoria has featured a significant number of cricketing greats, such as Warwick Armstrong, Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford, Neil Harvey, Hugh Trumble, Lindsay Hassett, Dean Jones, Jack Blackham, Jack Ryder, Bill Lawry, Bob Cowper, Shane Warne, Keith Miller and Ian Redpath. (See
here for a full listing of past players).

Victoria has been a powerful force in Australian cricket and the Australian cricket team has, at least until recent decades, never been short of Victorians in the line up.

The tradition of starting a cricket match at the MCG on Boxing Day also featured Victoria when they played New South Wales in 1965.

Victoria is the only first-class cricket team to have scored over 1,000 in an innings, which it achieved twice in the 1920s – 1,023 against Tasmania in 1922–23, and 1,107 against New South Wales in 1926–27.

==Identity==

Throughout its history, Victoria&#x27;s dominant colour has been navy blue, either in full when playing One-Day or Twenty20 competitions or on predominantly white kits in first-class cricket. The team logo replicates that of Cricket Victoria and has done so since the organisation chose to cease referring to the &quot;Bushrangers&quot; nickname when describing the men&#x27;s team. The current major sponsor of the team is the CitiPower.

He also is the voice of the Home Depot commercials.

==Early life==

Lucas was born Joshua Lucas Easy Dent Maurer on June 20, 1971, in Little Rock, Arkansas, the son of Michele (née LeFevre), a nurse midwife, and Don Maurer, an ER doctor.

Lucas grew up traveling the South with his parents, who were antinuclear activists, and his three younger siblings.

By the age of 13, he had lived in 30 different locations, including the Isle of Palms and Sullivan&#x27;s Island (both in South Carolina). His mother attended Emerson College with Jay Leno. The family eventually settled in Gig Harbor, Washington. He attended Kopachuck Middle School and graduated from Gig Harbor High School in 1989, where he acted in high school plays.

==Career==

Lucas began his career when he was 19, having moved to Hollywood after his high school graduation. He appeared as a guest star on several TV sitcoms in his early 20s, including Fox&#x27;s &quot;True Colors&quot; and &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose,&quot; the family drama &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; and CBS&#x27;s private-eye show &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;.

Other projects included the horror-thriller &quot;Child of Darkness, Child of Light&quot;, an adaptation of James Patterson&#x27;s novel &quot;Virgin&quot;, a tale of two Catholic schoolgirls who find themselves pregnant under mysterious and supernatural circumstances. Lucas followed this appearance by working with executive producer Steven Spielberg and then-unknown actor Clive Owen in the TV-movie &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot;, which follows the stories of a group of West Point cadets in 1861 as the Civil War breaks out. Lucas played George Armstrong Custer.

Soon afterward, he made his feature film debut in Frank Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Alive&quot; about a group of Uruguayan rugby players who, after crashing in the Andes mountains, resort to cannibalism to stay alive. After a brief appearance in the Patrick Swayze comedy &quot;Father Hood&quot;, Lucas relocated to Australia to play the hotheaded American cousin Luke McGregor opposite Andrew Clarke and Guy Pearce in the first season of the family western &quot;Snowy River: The McGregor Saga&quot;. Lucas appeared in all 13 episodes of the first season, but claimed in a later interview that despite the friendly environment, he was homesick for the United States, and his character was killed off in the second episode of season 2.

Upon returning to the States, he was still receiving offers as high school/college boyfriends and felt he was not getting the age-appropriate roles he sought. While working with George C. Scott on a TV-movie from the &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; series, Scott told him he needed to take acting lessons and develop his talent for both stage and screen. Shortly thereafter, he departed Hollywood and moved to New York City, where he studied privately with various acting coaches.
The second part of his career began with a lead role in the British rowing film &quot;True Blue&quot; (released in the US as &quot;Miracle at Oxford&quot;), in which he played a hotshot Navy rower who was recruited along with three other Americans to help Oxford win its annual boat race with Cambridge. He followed that with relatively small roles in the dramas &quot;Minotaur&quot; and &quot;Harvest&quot;. He took his first stab at comedy in &quot;The Definite Maybe&quot;, in which he played a recent college graduate who gets fired from his job and schemes with an old friend to purchase a house in the Hamptons.

He appeared as an American businessman in Jule Gilfillan&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Restless&quot;. He also appeared in an off-Broadway production of Terrence McNally&#x27;s controversial &quot;Corpus Christi&quot;, a retelling of the Passion, with the Jesus character (named Joshua) and his disciples all being gay. Lucas played the role of Judas as a gay predator. Right before the play was to open, Lucas was mugged and beaten on his way to the theater for dress rehearsal. He played the role of Judas with bloody bandages across his broken nose and black eyes. The audience thought the bandages were part of the play. Following a series of operations to reset his nose, he began gathering larger roles in films like &quot;American Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Weight of Water&quot;, &quot;Session 9&quot;, &quot;The Dancer&quot;, &quot;When Strangers Appear&quot;, and &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot;.
One of Lucas&#x27; first feature roles was playing Jace &quot;Flash&quot; Dillon in the cinematic PC flight simulator &quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot;.

Lucas gained mainstream exposure after his roles in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, and as Glenn Talbot in &quot;Hulk&quot;. He later had leading roles in movies such as &quot;Glory Road&quot;, &quot;Poseidon&quot;, and &quot;Stealth&quot;. In &quot;Glory Road&quot;, he starred as basketball coach Don Haskins, a role for which he gained .

His next project was Boaz Yakin’s &quot;Death in Love&quot;. &quot;Peacock&quot; is another film in which he starred. Lucas starred in the 2009 Ridley Scott-produced &quot;Tell-Tale&quot;, a film based on the short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe.

Earlier that year, Lucas was seen on stage in the off-Broadway run of &quot;Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell&quot;. Lucas also completed his second collaboration with documentary film maker Ken Burns, after being involved in Burns’ &quot;The War&quot;. Lucas&#x27; other documentary work includes &quot;Operational Homecoming&quot;, &quot;Trumbo&quot;, and the Los Angeles Film Festival Audience Award-winning &quot;Resolved&quot;. In February 2010, he was cast in the Anders Anderson thriller &quot;Stolen&quot; the single father of a mentally challenged boy, starring alongside Rhona Mitra and Jon Hamm; the film had a limited theatrical release in March 2010. Lucas also co-stars in the 2010 film &quot;Shadows and Lies&quot; alongside James Franco and Julianne Nicholson.

In 2011, Lucas co-starred with Rachael Taylor in the film &quot;Red Dog&quot;, based on the true story of an Australian Kelpie. Lucas won an Inside Film Award for his role. He also starred in the NBC television show &quot;The Firm&quot;, which takes place ten years after the John Grisham novel it is based on. The show lasted one season.

In 2013, Lucas was cast as the lead role in the independent comedy-drama, &quot;The Mend&quot;. The directorial debut of John Magary premiered at South By Southwest in March 2014 with Lucas receiving a series of positive reviews for his portrayal of Mat, one of two dysfunctional brothers who collide in a small Harlem apartment. From September 2014 to March 2016, Lucas appeared as a main character in the NBC crime drama &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot;.

In 2018, Lucas was cast in a recurring role in &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, as a younger version of John Dutton, portrayed by Kevin Costner.

Lucas&#x27;s career also includes voice-over work (or voice acting) with &quot;Breathe Bible&quot;.

Lucas is an owner and promoter of the company Filthy Food with friends Marc and Daniel Singer.

==Personal life==

Lucas met author and editor Jessica Ciencin Henriquez at a dog park in 2011. They became engaged six weeks later and married on March 17, 2012, in Central Park. Their son, Noah Rev, was born in June 2012. In January 2014, Ciencin Henriquez filed for a divorce that became final in October 2014. Lucas met meteorologist Brianna Ruffalo in 2022 and they were engaged in June 2024.

A YouthAIDS Ambassador, Lucas &quot;first joined the YouthAIDS team when he shot the ALDO HIV/AIDS awareness campaign in April, 2005. Soon after, he officially accepted his role as a YouthAIDS Ambassador at the YouthAIDS 2005 Gala, Faces of Africa. HIV/AIDS prevention is particularly important to him as his mother &#x27;has made a career counseling young men and women with the hopes of educating them about the ravaging and often deadly effects of this too common and easily preventable disease.&#x27;&quot;

===Politics===
Lucas supported President Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign, volunteering to help potential voters register at colleges in Pennsylvania. Lucas knocked on doors and phone banked, wearing an Obama shirt for 45 days. He was also in Denver, Colorado, for the 2008 Democratic National Convention with a group of actors called the Creative Coalition.

<text>The 1999 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], announced in January 2000, was the seventh such countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J. As in previous years, a CD featuring 36 (not necessarily the top 36) songs was released.

==Full list==

== Countries Represented ==
== Notes ==

* The 1999 countdown marks the first time Australia was the most represented nation in the Hottest 100. A record of 52 songs were by Australian artists. This record was equaled in the 2007 countdown, and broken in 2014.
** This is also the first Hottest 100 in which the top 3 songs were from Australian artists.
* &quot;These Days&quot; is the first B-side to win the Hottest 100, it&#x27;s &#x27;a-side&#x27; &quot;Passenger&quot; came in at No 100; making Powderfinger the first artist to be voted into No. 1 and No. 100 positions of a Hottest 100.
* Killing Heidi and The Tenants are the first Unearthed artists to appear in the Top 10 of the Hottest 100, finishing second and third respectively. Killing Heidi&#x27;s second place finish set the record for the highest ranking song by an Unearthed artist. This would later be equaled by Grinspoon (2002), Missy Higgins (2004), Art vs. Science (2009) and Little Red (2010), and was later broken by Vance Joy who won the 2013 countdown.
* There were eight songs in a row by Australian artists between positions #45 and #38. This is the longest run of Australian songs in a Hottest 100.
* Dave Grohl made his seventh consecutive appearance in the Hottest 100, having featured in every annual countdown to date.
** Garbage, Janet English and Regurgitator all made their fifth consecutive appearance, having appeared since 1995.

<doc id="1147984" wikidata="Q601805" url="?curid=1147984" title="Yasmin Le Bon">
<text>Yasmin Le Bon (née Parvaneh) is an English model. She was one of the highest-earning models during the 1980s and is married to Duran Duran&#x27;s lead singer Simon Le Bon.

==Early life==
Yasmin Parvaneh was born in Oxford, England, the younger child of an Iranian father and an English mother. Yasmin attended Cherwell School in Oxford.

Her mother worked as a window dresser in Elliston&#x27;s, a department store in Oxford, when she met Yasmin&#x27;s father. Her father taught photography at a polytechnic.

==Career==
She was spotted by a model scout in Oxford, at the age of 17. She modelled for a local agency while she attended school, and after leaving signed with Models 1 Agency in London. During her career as a fashion model she worked for and was a face for Versace, Chanel, Dior and many others top fashion designers.

In April 1987, she was hired by Guess for an advertising campaign.

She appeared on the cover of the first American and British issues of &quot;Elle&quot; and has also been on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;I.D.&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. As a model, she has also represented Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Bergdorf Goodman, Biotherm, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Bonwit Teller, Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel, Christian Dior, Clairol, Escada, Filene&#x27;s, Frasercard, Avon and Gianfranco Ferré.

In 2010 she appeared in Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Girl Panic&quot; video along with Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, and Eva Herzigova.

In January 2012, Le Bon wore a gown weighing in the Stéphane Rolland spring/summer Haute Couture show in Paris.

==Other endeavours ==

Le Bon was invited to be one of the drivers in the 2013 Mille Miglia race in Italy. Each year, the three-day event passes through nearly 200 Italian towns from Brescia to Rome and back, recreating the original races which took place between 1927 and 1957. She and her co-driver, David Gandy, were part of Team Jaguar, driving a 1950 Jaguar XK120. Early in the race, Le Bon and Gandy were &quot;pushed off the road by a competitor&quot;, which caused body damage to the wing and side of the vintage car. They re-entered the race, ultimately finishing in 158th place out of 415 cars.

==Personal life==
In 1984, she met Simon Le Bon, lead singer of the pop rock band Duran Duran, after he had seen her on a magazine cover and spoken with her agent. They married on 27 December 1985, at the register office in her hometown of Oxford. The couple have three children including Amber Le Bon.

<text>The Ōpihi River flows through south Canterbury, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull.

==Description==
The river flows south-east for , reaching the Pacific Ocean north of Timaru. The town of Fairlie lies on the river&#x27;s banks.

==History==
The banks of the river around the settlement of Waitohi were the site of some of the first flights by pioneer aviator Richard Pearse.

Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) were introduced from California in the 1900s and persist today.

In 2000, Environment Canterbury approved the Opihi River Regional Plan for sustainable management of the resources of the river.

<text>Xeni Jardin (; born Jennifer Hamm, August 5, 1970) is an American weblogger, digital media commentator, and tech culture journalist. She is known as a former co-editor of the collaborative weblog &quot;Boing Boing&quot;, a former contributor to &quot;&quot;Wired&quot; Magazine&quot; and &quot;Wired News&quot;, and a former correspondent for the National Public Radio show &quot;Day to Day&quot;. She has also worked as a guest technology news commentator for television networks such as PBS NewsHour, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and ABC.

==Life and work==
Jardin was born in Richmond, Virginia, on August 5, 1970. Her father, artist Glenn B. Hamm Jr., died in August 1980 of ALS. She left home at age 14, but remained in school in Richmond. Her brother, Carl M. Hamm, retained their family name, and is a Richmond, Virginia-based disc jockey, who performs under the stage name &quot;DJ Carl Hamm&quot; (formerly, &quot;DJ Carlito&quot;).

Jardin previously stated that she preferred the name &quot;Xeni Jardin&quot; over her given name. &quot;Xeni&quot; is short for &quot;Xeniflores,&quot; while &quot;jardin&quot; is the Spanish and French word for &quot;garden&quot;. In May 2021, Jardin stated that she had been given this name by someone who had abused her, and she was now moving back to using her legal name.

Prior to becoming a journalist, she was site editor for travel agency Traveltrust, then Supervisor of Enterprise Web Technology for Latham &amp; Watkins before working at Quaartz, an internet calendaring startup.

Her career as a journalist began in 1999 when she was associated with Jason Calacanis&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Alley Reporter&quot;, first as a contributing editor, and later as Vice President of &quot;Silicon Alley&quot;″s parent company, Rising Tide Studios. In 2001 she became a freelance writer for &quot;Wired&quot; and other magazines, and in 2002 she began contributing to &quot;Boing Boing&quot; after Mark Frauenfelder met her at a party and invited her to be a co-editor. Jardin has written op-ed pieces for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. She has been the main source of an article in &quot;The Age&quot; talking about the cultural relevance of Wikipedia articles, and the source for a &quot;New York Times&quot; article discussing &quot;Boing Boing&quot;″s part in the creation of the Flying Spaghetti Monster internet meme.

Jardin is also involved in television and radio work. In 2003, she began contributing the &quot;Xeni Tech&quot; segment for NPR&#x27;s show &quot;Day to Day&quot;, and has appeared as a guest on the &quot;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; to discuss &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s decision to remove their comments section (a step &quot;Boing Boing&quot; had also taken). She has made appearances on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, and was featured on the BBC Radio 5 show &quot;Pods and Blogs&quot; discussing her work at &quot;Boing Boing&quot;. Jardin was the host and executive producer of the Webby recognized Boing Boing Video series. Boing Boing Video (originally branded as Boing Boing TV) was initially offered exclusively on Virgin America flights in 2007. Alongside technology and culture, Jardin has been covering the aftermath and atrocities that resulted from the Guatemalan Civil War since 2007.

In 2008, Jardin was the executive producer of the web series &quot;SPAMasterpiece Theater&quot;. Each episode features a dramatization of email spam, while the later episodes featured dramatic readings of email spam by humorist John Hodgman. In the third episode &quot;Love Song of Kseniya,&quot; Jardin reads her own email spam.

A June 2008 controversy over Jardin&#x27;s deleting from public view all posts and links associated with sex blogger Violet Blue in the wake of a falling-out led to discussions about journalism ethics and standards and media transparency.

On December 1, 2011, she live-blogged her first mammogram, which returned a positive diagnosis of breast cancer. Since her treatment and recovery she has become an outspoken advocate for the Affordable Care Act.

In 2012, Jardin became one of the initial supporters of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. In December 2016, after a dispute with Julian Assange regarding the supposed relations between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign, she resigned from its board, citing health reasons.

In 2019, Jardin replied &quot;Homie what set you from&quot; on Twitter, after claiming that Nancy Pelosi was &quot;gangsta checkin&#x27;&quot; Donald Trump and that only people from Los Angeles would understand. This, and her tweets claiming that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were both gay, garnered a decent amount of media backlash.

In February 2021, Jardin left &quot;Boing Boing&quot;.

<doc id="1147994" wikidata="Q467736" url="?curid=1147994" title="Friedmann equations">
<text>The Friedmann equations, also known as the Friedmann–Lemaître (FL) equations, are a set of equations in physical cosmology that govern cosmic expansion in homogeneous and isotropic models of the universe within the context of general relativity. They were first derived by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 from Einstein&#x27;s field equations of gravitation for the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric and a perfect fluid with a given mass density and pressure . The equations for negative spatial curvature were given by Friedmann in 1924.
The physicals models built on the Friedmann equations are called FRW or FLRW models and from the &quot;Standard Model&quot; of modern cosmology, although such a description is also associated with the further developed Lambda-CDM model. The FLRW model was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.

== Assumptions ==
The Friedmann equations build on three assumptions: 
# the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric,
# Einstein&#x27;s equations for general relativity, and
# a perfect fluid source.
The metric in turn starts with the simplifying assumption that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic, that is, the cosmological principle; empirically, this is justified on scales larger than the order of 100 Mpc. 

The metric can be written as:
formula_1
where 
formula_2
These three possibilities correspond to parameter of (0) flat space, (+1) a sphere of constant positive curvature or (-1) a hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature.
Here the radial position has been decomposed into a time-dependent scale factor, formula_3, and a comoving coordinate, formula_4. 
Inserting this metric into Einstein&#x27;s field equations relate the evolution of this scale factor to the pressure and energy of the matter in the universe. With the stress–energy tensor for a perfect fluid, results in the equations are described below.

=== Dimensionless scale factor ===
A dimensionless scale factor can be defined:
formula_5
using the present day value
:formula_6.
The Friedmann equations can be written in terms of this dimensionless scale factor:
formula_7
where formula_8 and formula_9.

== Equations ==
There are two independent Friedmann equations for modelling a homogeneous, isotropic universe
The first is: 
formula_10 and second is:
formula_11
The term &quot;Friedmann equation&quot; sometimes is used only for the first equation.
In these equations,
 is the cosmological scale factor, formula_12 is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, is the cosmological constant with dimension length−2,  is the energy density and is the isotropic pressure. is constant throughout a particular solution, but may vary from one solution to another. The units set the speed of light in vacuum to one. 

In previous equations, , , and are functions of time. If the cosmological constant, , is ignored, the term formula_13 in the first Friedmann equation can be interpreted as a Newtonian total energy, so the evolution of the universe pits gravitational potential energy, formula_14 against kinetic energy, formula_15. The winner depends upon the value in the total energy: if k is +1, gravity eventually causes the universe to contract. These conclusions will be altered if the is not zero.

Using the first equation, the second equation can be re-expressed as:
formula_16
which eliminates . Alternatively the conservation of mass–energy:
formula_17
leads to the same result. 

== Critical density ==
That value of the mass-energy density, formula_18 that gives formula_19 when formula_20 is called the critical density: 
formula_21
If the universe has higher density, formula_22, then it is called &quot;spatially closed&quot;: in this simple approximation the universe would eventually contract. On the other hand, if has lower density, formula_23, then it is called &quot;spatially open&quot; and expands forever. Therefore the geometry of the universe is directly connected to its density.

== Density parameter ==

The density parameter is defined as the ratio of the actual (or observed) density to the critical density of the Friedmann universe:
formula_24
Both the density formula_25 and the Hubble parameter formula_26 depend upon time and thus the density parameter varies with time. 

The critical density is equivalent to approximately five atoms (of monatomic hydrogen) per cubic metre, whereas the average density of ordinary matter in the Universe is believed to be 0.2–0.25 atoms per cubic metre.

A much greater density comes from the unidentified dark matter, although both ordinary and dark matter contribute in favour of contraction of the universe. However, the largest part comes from so-called dark energy, which accounts for the cosmological constant term. Although the total density is equal to the critical density (exactly, up to measurement error), dark energy does not lead to contraction of the universe but rather may accelerate its expansion.

An expression for the critical density is found by assuming to be zero (as it is for all basic Friedmann universes) and setting the normalised spatial curvature, , equal to zero. When the substitutions are applied to the first of the Friedmann equations given the new formula_27 value we find:
formula_28where:

* formula_29

* formula_30

*formula_31

Given the value of dark energy to be formula_32
This term originally was used as a means to determine the spatial geometry of the universe, where is the critical density for which the spatial geometry is flat (or Euclidean). Assuming a zero vacuum energy density, if is larger than unity, the space sections of the universe are closed; the universe will eventually stop expanding, then collapse. If is less than unity, they are open; and the universe expands forever. However, one can also subsume the spatial curvature and vacuum energy terms into a more general expression for in which case this density parameter equals exactly unity. Then it is a matter of measuring the different components, usually designated by subscripts. According to the ΛCDM model, there are important components of due to baryons, cold dark matter and dark energy. The spatial geometry of the universe has been measured by the WMAP spacecraft to be nearly flat. This means that the universe can be well approximated by a model where the spatial curvature parameter is zero; however, this does not necessarily imply that the universe is infinite: it might merely be that the universe is much larger than the part we see.

The first Friedmann equation is often seen in terms of the present values of the density parameters, that is
formula_33
Here is the radiation density today (when ), is the matter (dark plus baryonic) density today, is the &quot;spatial curvature density&quot; today, and is the cosmological constant or vacuum density today.

=== Other forms ===

These equations are sometimes simplified by replacing
formula_34
to give:
formula_35

The simplified form of the second equation is invariant under this transformation.

The Hubble parameter can change over time if other parts of the equation are time dependent (in particular the mass density, the vacuum energy, or the spatial curvature). Evaluating the Hubble parameter at the present time yields Hubble&#x27;s constant which is the proportionality constant of Hubble&#x27;s law. Applied to a fluid with a given equation of state, the Friedmann equations yield the time evolution and geometry of the universe as a function of the fluid density.

We see that in the Friedmann equations, does not depend on which coordinate system we chose for spatial slices. There are two commonly used choices for and which describe the same physics:

* or depending on whether the shape of the universe is a closed 3-sphere, flat (Euclidean space) or an open 3-hyperboloid, respectively. If , then is the radius of curvature of the universe. If , then may be fixed to any arbitrary positive number at one particular time. If , then (loosely speaking) one can say that is the radius of curvature of the universe.
* is the scale factor which is taken to be 1 at the present time. is the current spatial curvature (when ). If the shape of the universe is hyperspherical and is the radius of curvature ( at the present), then . If is positive, then the universe is hyperspherical. If , then the universe is Euclidean (flat). If is negative, then the universe has hyperbolic geometry.

== FLRW models ==

Relativisitic cosmology models based on the FLRW metric and obeying the Friedmann equations are called FRW models.
Direct observation of stars has shown their velocities to be dominated by radial recession, validating these assumptions for cosmological models.
These models are the basis of the standard model of Big Bang cosmological including the current ΛCDM model.

To apply the metric to cosmology and predict its time evolution via the scale factor formula_36 requires Einstein&#x27;s field equations together with a way of calculating the density, formula_37 such as a cosmological equation of state.
This process allows an approximate analytic solution Einstein&#x27;s field equations formula_38 giving the Friedmann equations when the energy–momentum tensor is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are:
: formula_39
: formula_40

Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the Big Bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies or stars, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models that calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the observable universe is well approximated by an &quot;almost FLRW model&quot;, i.e., a model that follows the FLRW metric apart from primordial density fluctuations. , the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from COBE and WMAP.

=== Interpretation ===
The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations
: formula_41
: formula_42
with formula_43, the spatial curvature index, serving as a constant of integration for the first equation.

The first equation can be derived also from thermodynamical considerations and is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, assuming the expansion of the universe is an adiabatic process (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric).

The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe formula_44 to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of gravitation, with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of general relativity. The cosmological constant, on the other hand, causes an acceleration in the expansion of the universe.

=== Cosmological constant ===
The cosmological constant term can be omitted if we make the following replacements
: formula_45
: formula_46

Therefore, the cosmological constant can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy that has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density:
: formula_47
which is an equation of state of vacuum with dark energy.

An attempt to generalize this to
: formula_48
would not have general invariance without further modification.

In fact, in order to get a term that causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a scalar field that satisfies
: formula_49
Such a field is sometimes called quintessence.

=== Newtonian interpretation ===
This is due to McCrea and Milne, although sometimes incorrectly ascribed to Friedmann. The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations:
: formula_50
: formula_51
where is some integration constant to be fixed by the choice of initial conditions. This family of solutions labelled by is extremely important for cosmology. For example, describes a matter-dominated universe, where the pressure is negligible with respect to the mass density. From the generic solution one easily sees that in a matter-dominated universe the scale factor goes as
formula_52 matter-dominated
Another important example is the case of a radiation-dominated universe, namely when . This leads to
formula_53 radiation-dominated

Note that this solution is not valid for domination of the cosmological constant, which corresponds to an . In this case the energy density is constant and the scale factor grows exponentially.

Solutions for other values of can be found at 

===Mixtures===
If the matter is a mixture of two or more non-interacting fluids each with such an equation of state, then
formula_54
holds separately for each such fluid . In each case,
formula_55
from which we get
formula_56

For example, one can form a linear combination of such terms
formula_57
where is the density of &quot;dust&quot; (ordinary matter, ) when ; is the density of radiation () when ; and is the density of &quot;dark energy&quot; (). One then substitutes this into
formula_58
and solves for as a function of time.

== History ==

Friedmann published two cosmology papers in the 1922-1923 time frame. He adopted the same homogeneity and isotropy assumptions used by Albert Einstein and by Willem de Sitter in their papers, both published in 1917. Both of the earlier works also assumed the universe was static, eternally unchanging. Einstein postulated an additional term to his equations of general relativity to ensure this stability. In his paper, de Sitter showed that spacetime had curvature even in the absence of matter: the new equations of general relativity implied that a vacuum had properties that altered spacetime. 

The idea of static universe was a fundamental assumption of philosophy and science. However, Friedmann abandoned the idea in his first paper &quot;On the curvature of space&quot;. Starting with Einstein&#x27;s 10 equations of relativity, Friedmann applies the symmetry of an isotropic universe and a simple model for mass-energy density to derive a relationship between that density and the curvature of spacetime. He demonstrates that in addition to one solution is static, many time dependent solutions also exist.

Friedmann&#x27;s second paper, &quot;On the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature,&quot; published in 1924 explored more complex geometrical ideas. This paper establish the idea that that the finiteness of spacetime was not a property that could be established based on the equations of general relativity alone: both finite and infinite geometries could be used to give solutions. Friedmann used two concepts of a three dimensional sphere as analogy: a trip at constant latitude could return to the starting point or the sphere might have an infinite number of sheets and the trip never repeats.

Friedmann&#x27;s paper were largely ignored except – initially – by Einstein who actively dismissed them. However once Edwin Hubble published astronomical evidence that the universe was expanding, Einstein became convinced. Unfortunately for Friedmann, Georges Lemaître discovered some aspects of the same solutions and wrote persuasively about the concept of a universe born from a &quot;primordial atom&quot;. Thus historians give these two scientists equal billing for the discovery.

== In popular culture ==

Several students at Tsinghua University (CCP leader Xi Jinping&#x27;s alma mater) participating in the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China carried placards with Friedmann equations scrawled on them, interpreted by some as a play on the words &quot;Free man&quot;. Others have interpreted the use of the equations as a call to “open up” China and stop its Zero Covid policy, as the Friedmann equations relate to the expansion, or “opening” of the universe.

<text>Faye Louise Tozer Smith (born 14 November 1975) is an English singer and actress, best known as a member of the pop group Steps.

==Career==

===Music===
Steps are a pop group that have had a series of charted singles between 1997 and 2020. Their name is based on a gimmick: each of their music videos are choreographed, and the dance steps are included with most of their single releases. Steps have sold over 22 million records, including 15 million albums.

During Steps’ split Tozer returned to the pop charts once, duetting with Russell Watson. Their UK single &quot;Someone Like You&quot; charted at No. 10 in May 2002 and she joined him on his UK tour around the same time. In 2006, Tozer was featured as a guest vocalist for Plastic Cinema for two songs: &quot;Take Me Under&quot; and &quot;Any Minute Now&quot;.

Steps reformed in May 2011 for a four-part documentary series on Sky Living titled &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot;. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second greatest hits album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, that was released on 10 October 2011. The album entered the charts at number one, becoming the band&#x27;s third album to achieve this feat. The second series of &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot; titled &quot;Steps: On the Road Again&quot; aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout 22-date UK tour. On 24 September 2012, the group confirmed they would release their fourth studio album &quot;Light Up The World&quot; on 12 November 2012, alongside a six-date Christmas tour, starting from 30 November and ending on 5 December. The group reformed for a second time on 1 January 2017 in celebration of their 20th anniversary, and later announced their fifth studio album &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor&quot;, which was released in April 2017 and entered the charts at number 2. On 5 March 2017, the group confirmed the release of the new album, alongside its lead single, &quot;Scared of the Dark&quot;, and a 22-date tour, Party on the Dancefloor. A deluxe edition of the album, titled &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor: Crying at the Disco&quot;, was released on 27 October.

In November 2017, Tozer announced that the reunion was no longer just a 20th-anniversary celebration and that the group intends to continue after their 2018 Summer of Steps tour. On 7 September 2020, via their social media accounts, Steps announced the release date of their album entitled &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;. The album was released on 27 November of the same year, with pre-orders available from 8 September. The next day, they confirmed a new 14-date UK tour (with special guest Sophie Ellis-Bextor) starting in November 2021. The first single from the album was the Greg Kurstin-and-Sia-penned &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;, released on 9 September 2020. It was followed by &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot; on 27 October 2020. &quot;To the Beat of My Heart&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in January 2021.

The first single of &quot;What the Future Holds Pt. 2&quot; was confirmed as a reworked version of &quot;Heartbreak in This City&quot; featuring Michelle Visage.

===Film and theatre===

Tozer has combined a pop career with theatre work and acting. In 2004 she made her professional musical-theatre debut in a national tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s one-woman musical &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;. She and Patsy Palmer alternated in the role. Tozer toured with the musical &quot;Love Shack&quot;, which also featured former pop singers Jon Lee and Noel Sullivan, and soon after starred as &quot;Jubilee Climax&quot; in a production of &quot;Saucy Jack and the Space Vixens&quot; at The Venue Leicester Square in London&#x27;s West End.

In 2006 she toured in a production of &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, acted in the film &quot;Lady Godiva Back in the Saddle&quot; and appeared in the charity fitness DVD &quot;The Allstar Workout&quot;. In 2007, Tozer appeared in a production of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; and in October began touring with the production &quot;Over the Rainbow – the Eva Cassidy Story&quot; playing Eva Cassidy. At Christmas 2007, she appeared in the pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle.

Over Christmas 2008, Tozer played alongside &quot;X Factor&quot; finalist Ray Quinn in Aladdin, at the Broadway Theatre in Peterborough. Tozer has filmed roles in the independent films &quot;Kung Fu Flid&quot; and &quot;Mixed Up&quot;. In 2010, Tozer appeared in &quot;In The Spotlight – Songs From The Musicals&quot; which completed a UK tour, directed by Karen Edwards and choreographed by Tom Gribby. In December 2010 she starred in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Grove Theatre in her home town of Dunstable.

In 2011 Tozer starred alongside her fellow Steps group member Ian &quot;H&quot; Watkins in a UK premier tour of &quot;Rhinestone Mondays&quot;. The musical was the first Country and Western to be produced, with Tozer playing the part of Annie. In 2013 Tozer starred in the musical &quot;The Tailor-Made Man&quot; at the Arts Theatre in London&#x27;s West End for a limited 8-week run. She played the part of silent movie star Marion Davies. Tozer has played the role of Miss Hedge in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie&quot; in London&#x27;s Apollo Theatre in the West End.

===Television===
Tozer appeared on the fifth series of &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot; with her son Benjamin.

She also placed third in a celebrity edition of &quot;Four Weddings&quot;, losing out to Michelle Marsh.

In 2017, Tozer was one of four contestants on season 7, episode 8 of The Celebrity Chase, progressing to the episode&#x27;s Final Chase.

From September 2018, Tozer participated in the sixteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, where her professional dance partner was Giovanni Pernice. The couple were joint runners-up in the final.


She appeared on a celebrity special of the classic game show &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, with Sir Chris Hoy, Martine McCutcheon and hosted by Stephen Mulhern all trying to guess the familiar phrases.

<text>Joe Moore is an American television personality. He is known mainly as the principal news anchor at KHON-TV in Honolulu, Hawaii; the state&#x27;s Fox affiliate and highest-rated station. He is also a professional actor and playwright.

==Early life, military==
Growing up in Honolulu, Moore attended Aiea High School for three years, but graduated from Beavercreek High School in Beavercreek, Ohio, where his father, a career United States Air Force officer, was stationed. He attended the University of Maryland, College Park where he majored in communication and history, but after two years of college, he enlisted in the United States Army. Moore served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War with the Army&#x27;s 25th Infantry Division in Cu Chi, Vietnam, and the American Forces Vietnam Network in Saigon with close friend Pat Sajak.

==Journalism==
Moore returned to Hawaii in 1969, joined KGMB as sports anchor under mentor and news director Bob Sevey. After nine years as part of the market-dominating news team at KGMB, Moore moved to KHON-TV which was then Hawaii&#x27;s NBC affiliate (it joined Fox in 1995). Within a few years, KHON had passed KGMB as the top-rated station in Hawaii—a lead it continues to hold. In 2008, KHON-TV extended Moore&#x27;s contract as lead news anchor for ten years.

==Dramatic arts==
Moore has starred in two independent motion pictures, &quot;Goodbye Paradise&quot; (1991, featuring James Hong and Pat Morita), and &quot;Moonglow&quot; (2000, co-starring Milo O&#x27;Shea and Joanna Cassidy)

He has appeared in various episodes of network television series based in Hawaii, including &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Magnum P.I&quot;, &quot;Jake and the Fat Man&quot;, &quot;One West Waikiki&quot;, and &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;.

Moore has also starred in live theatrical productions. He has co-starred numerous times with his longtime friend, television host Pat Sajak. The two have starred together in the Neil Simon play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in 2001 and 2012 (at the Connecticut Repertory Theatre), with Moore playing the slovenly Oscar Madison. They appeared together in a theatrical adaptation of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; in 2004. They starred together in the Bernard Sabath play &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot; in 2010 at the Hawaii Theatre in Honolulu. They co-starred in the dramatic comedy &quot;Wrestling Ernest Hemingway&quot;, based on the 1993 film, in 2014 at the Hawaii Theatre.

Moore wrote and starred in &quot;Prophecy and Honor&quot; (2007, co-starring Richard Dreyfuss and George Segal). In 2013 Moore co-starred with Patty Duke in &quot;Heaven Forbid!&quot;, based on the BBC series &quot;Waiting for God&quot; at the Hawaii Theatre. In June 2015 he starred as James Wicker in the first post Broadway production of Terrence McNally&#x27;s comedy, &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;, also starring Linda Purl and Cathy Foy, at the Hawaii Theatre.

Among the other produced plays that Moore has written and appeared in are &quot;Will Rogers Returns&quot;, &quot;The Buck Stops Where?&quot;, &quot;A Conversation with Mozart&quot;, &quot;John Wayne: The Man Behind the Legend&quot;, &quot;The Heydrich Covenant&quot;, &quot;The Best Show in America: Will Rogers on Politics&quot;, &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, &quot;Unlikely Lawman&quot; and &quot;Righteous Revenge&quot;.

==Personal life==

Moore has been married to his wife Teresa, since 1991, and has one son, Bryce, who was born in 1998 and joined his father on the KHON staff as a journalist in 2021.

<doc id="1148005" wikidata="Q5553912" url="?curid=1148005" title="Get In">
<text>Get In is the second and final studio album by the British alternative rock band Kenickie. It was released on 25 August 1998 and reached number thirty-two on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Get In&quot; includes the singles &quot;I Would Fix You&quot; and &quot;Stay in the Sun&quot;.

==Production and release==
The album was produced by Adrian Bushby and band-member Peter Gofton, except &quot;I Would Fix You&quot; which was produced by Bushby and Gofton with Andy Carpenter. Having been moved from the closed EMI subsidiary EMIdisc, the album was first released on CD and Cassette by the parent label. The album was re-released in February 2012 by Eastworld with seven bonus tracks. The artwork was designed by Nick Edwards.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Get In&quot; received generally positive reviews. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Everett True praised it as &quot;a most ravishing record&quot; and contrasted the dark tone of the album&#x27;s lyrics with its upbeat music, which he called &quot;some of the most gorgeous, succulent pop around&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Victoria Segal wrote: &quot;This is the sound of a band refusing to play the game set out for them – attractive blonde singer, chirpy attitude, ladders to the top – risking a slide down the snakes instead ... the exuberant, lip-glossed evil of &#x27;Punka&#x27; has been replaced by the maturity shorthand of strings and synths, flamenco flamboyance kicking up alongside deadpan electro, Shangrai-La&#x27;s drumbeats booming next to high-kicking pastiche. It&#x27;s often audaciously bleak ... but they aren&#x27;t stupid enough to go to the other Svengali-approved extreme and dress up as tragic divas. If it&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s because the situation described in &#x27;I Would Fix You&#x27; is messy; if it&#x27;s brave, it&#x27;s never foolish.&quot;

Broadsheet newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also praised the album:

<text>Cerys Elizabeth Matthews (; born 11 April 1969) is a Welsh singer, songwriter, author, and broadcaster. She was a founding member of Welsh rock band Catatonia and a leading figure in the &quot;Cool Cymru&quot; movement of the late 1990s.

Matthews now hosts a weekly music show on BBC Radio 6 Music, a weekly blues show on BBC Radio 2, and a weekly show on BBC Radio 4, &quot;Add To Playlist&quot;, which won the Prix Italia and Prix Europa 2022. She also makes documentaries for television and radio and was a roving reporter for &quot;The One Show&quot;. She founded &quot;The Good Life Experience&quot;, a festival of culture and the great outdoors in Flintshire in 2014, and is author of &quot;Hook, Line and Singer&quot;, published by Penguin Books, and children&#x27;s stories &quot;Tales from the Deep&quot; and &quot;Gelert, A Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, published by Gomer. Matthews&#x27; illustrated version of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was published in November 2022, by Weidenfeld and Nicolson.

==Early life==
Matthews was born in Cardiff, the second of four siblings. The family relocated to Swansea when she was seven. She went to Bryn Y Mor Welsh language school until 11 years of age, then attended St Michael&#x27;s School, Llanelli. Later, she attended Ysgol Bro Gwaun comprehensive school when she lived in the Pembrokeshire village of Trefin, and Bryanston School, an independent school in Dorset, England.

She has cited her childhood heroes as being Pippi Longstocking and writers William Butler Yeats and Dylan Thomas.

Matthews learned to play the guitar at the age of nine, sang Welsh folk songs and taught herself traditional songs from all over the world, including blues and Irish folk songs. She was a member of the West Glamorgan Youth Orchestra. She had a stint in Spain as a nanny, where she learned to speak Catalan.

==Career==
===Catatonia===

Catatonia were formed in 1992, after Matthews met Mark Roberts. She subsequently sang lead vocals on, and co-wrote the music and lyrics for, the band&#x27;s hits. Songs she co-wrote included &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Lot to Answer For&quot;, &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot;, &quot;Dead from the Waist Down&quot;, and &quot;Road Rage&quot;. Matthews also played guitar on the earlier material before second guitarist Owen Powell joined the band. She also performed a single with the band Space named &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot;, which tells the story of two lovers who want to kill each other, but then hear a Tom Jones song that defuses their homicidal feelings. Matthews later collaborated with Jones to record a version of Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; on Jones&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Reload&quot;. Matthews was voted the &quot;Sexiest Female in Rock&quot; in a 1999 readers&#x27; poll in the now-defunct magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

After Catatonia&#x27;s rise to fame with their second album &quot;International Velvet&quot;, and subsequent success with &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot;, the band returned in 2001 with their fourth studio album, &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot;. In September 2001, the band officially split.

===2000s===
Matthews joined the Pet Shop Boys on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in June 2000, performing a duet of their hit &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;. In December 2001, she returned to the recording studio for the first time since Catatonia split up. She recorded a song in both English and Welsh for the pre-school cartoon series &quot;Sali Mali&quot;. She provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Cyclops Rock&quot;, from US alternative rock band They Might Be Giants 2001 album &quot;Mink Car&quot;. Her line was originally supposed to be provided by Joe Strummer of the Clash. Cerys went on to co-write &quot;Gypsy Song&quot; with Strummer on her &quot;Cockahoop&quot; album released by Rough Trade in 2003.

Matthews moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2001. On her arrival she began playing with Bucky Baxter, who had played lap steel guitar for Bob Dylan and Ryan Adams. She had already collected 76 traditional folk songs with the idea of making an album of folk covers. Her debut album, &quot;Cockahoop&quot;, ended up consisting mainly of her own songs. It was recorded in seven months and appeared on Blanco y Negro Records in the United Kingdom in May 2003. While recording this album she met Seth Riddle, whom she married in Pembrokeshire on 22 February 2003. She toured the album around Britain with minimal promotion as she was several months pregnant at the time. The album&#x27;s Stateside Records release followed in October 2004.

In December 2005, Matthews recorded a version of Len Barry&#x27;s 1960s UK and US top-10 hit &quot;1-2-3&quot; in Nashville. She released it as a download-single with all profits going to a children&#x27;s charity. In early 2006, Matthews introduced material from her then upcoming album at SXSW in Austin, Texas.

In 2006, Matthews conducted a short tour of the UK to promote her second solo album, &quot;Never Said Goodbye&quot;. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Open Roads&quot;. Band members included Kevin Teel on guitar, Ben Elkins playing keyboards, Mason Neely on drums, and Jeff Irwin playing bass. She headlined Cardiff&#x27;s &quot;Big Weekend festival&quot;. During September and October 2006, Matthews embarked on a UK and Ireland tour, during which she played tracks from her first two solo albums as well as three Catatonia hits. She also embarked upon a short acoustic Welsh tour in November 2006 before returning to Nashville for Christmas.

Matthews appeared on the 2007 series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which aired from 12 to 30 November. She was voted off one day before the final episode, coming fourth behind Jason &quot;J&quot; Brown, Janice Dickinson and eventual winner Christopher Biggins. Matthews became involved with fellow contestant Marc Bannerman after the show, but they split four months later. Matthews appeared at the live &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; concert at the Hackney Empire, London in 2007. She performed the Bonnie Tyler hit &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; and the Dolly Parton/Kenny Rogers duet &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; along with Terry Hall and the BBC Concert Orchestra.

In an interview on the eve of the launch of her Welsh mini-album &quot;Awyren = Aeroplane&quot;, Matthews confirmed she had divorced from Riddle and temporarily moved back to her farm in Pembrokeshire. &quot;Awyren = Aeroplane&quot; won her the &quot;Contemporary Composition&quot; award in the National Eisteddfod. The award had been resurrected and presented for the first time since 1936. In 2007, Matthews became Vice-President of the Welsh homelessness charity Shelter Cymru. She also accepted a role of Performing Arts Ambassador for Linden Lodge School, Wimbledon in the same year.

Matthews joined the Welsh band Manic Street Preachers onstage at The O2 on 28 February 2008 to sing the female vocals of their 2007 hit &quot;Your Love Alone Is Not Enough&quot; as part of the NME awards celebrations that year. She replaced Nina Persson in both the awards ceremony (within indigO2) and at the following &quot;Big Gig&quot; live show (within The O2 Arena).

From November 2008, Matthews sat in for Stephen Merchant and Marc Riley on BBC 6 Music and went on to present George Lamb&#x27;s slot in April 2009. In May 2009, she presented the show &quot;A Month of Sundays With... Cerys Matthews&quot;. She then covered for Nemone on 6 Music from July 2009, while Nemone was on maternity leave.

Matthews began maternity leave from November 2009 and had to finish presenting the show a month early. In April 2010, Matthews returned to 6 Music to present a weekend show on Sunday mornings. She produces and presents radio documentaries and shows, including &quot;Hook Line and Singer&quot;, where she shared her love of fishing on Radio 4.

Matthews released her first CD in two years in October 2009. The album, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;, was released in two versions, one in English and the other in Welsh (the title of the Welsh edition was &quot;Paid Edrych i Lawr&quot;). It was recorded in Providence, Rhode Island, Nashville, Seattle and London, and coincided with a two-week UK tour in October.

===Since 2010===
Matthews has covered Glastonbury Festival for both BBC Television and BBC 6 Music, she wrote and presented a BBC Two programme on poetry and presented TV documentaries on singer Dorothy Squires, the Mississippi River and Cuba. She wrote and presented a documentary on early blues players such as Memphis Minnie, children&#x27;s character Pippi Longstocking, Mahalia Jackson and the celebrated British blues label &quot;Blue Horizon&quot;. She has presented a documentary for BBC Radio 2 on Maida Vale studios. She frequently contributes to BBC Radio 4 programmes such as &quot;Feedback&quot;, &quot;Frontrow&quot;, &quot;Loose Ends&quot; and &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, also writing a column for world music magazine &quot;Songlines&quot;. Since 2021, Matthews and Jeffrey Boakye have presented &quot;Add To Playlist&quot;, which explores connections in music. She has curated festivals for the Tate Modern, the Shetland theatre and Womex.

In 2010, Matthews released &quot;Tir&quot; (in Welsh: &quot;territory&quot; or &quot;land&quot;), a collection of traditional Welsh songs, and of photographs from her family archive from the 1880s to 1940s of people at work and play. They included &quot;Calon Lân&quot;, &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot;, &quot;Migldi-Magldi&quot; (sung as a duet with Bryn Terfel), &quot;Myfanwy&quot; and &quot;Sosban Fach&quot;. This is the third release on her own label, Rainbow City.

&quot;Explorer&quot; is Matthews&#x27;s fourth solo album (2011). In both selecting and writing the songs she delved into the influence of both the music she has heard round the globe, and the places she had visited. Recorded over seven days, the album from the outset had no pre-determined sound or calculated format.

<doc id="1148012" wikidata="Q5008114" url="?curid=1148012" title="C3-convertase">
<text>C3 convertase (&quot;C4bC2b&quot;, formerly &quot;C4b2a&quot;) belongs to family of serine proteases and is necessary in innate immunity as a part of the complement system which eventuate in opsonisation of particles, release of inflammatory peptides, C5 convertase formation and cell lysis.

C3 convertase can be used to refer to the form produced in the alternative pathway (C3bBb) or the classical and lectin pathways (C4bC2b, formerly C4b2a). Once formed, both C3 convertases will catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b (hence the name &quot;C3-convertase&quot;).

The smaller fragment called C3a serves to increase vascular permeability and promote extravasation of phagocytes, while the larger C3b fragment can be used as an opsonin or bind to either type of C3 convertase to form the trimolecular C5 convertase to activate C5 for the membrane attack complex.

== Formation ==
C3 convertase formation can occur in three different pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways.

=== Alternative pathway ===
Cleavage of complement C3 by a free floating convertase, thrombin, plasmin or even a bacterial enzyme leads to formation of C3a and C3b fragments. C3b, the larger fragment, becomes covalently attached to the microbial surface or to the antibody molecules through the thioester domain at the site of complement activation. After cleavage and binding to cell surface, the C3b fragment is ready to bind a plasma protein called Factor B. The Factor B (a zymogen) is cleaved by a plasma serine protease Factor D releasing a small fragment called Ba and generating a larger fragment called Bb that remains attached to C3b. Also Mg2+ ions are necessary for forming a functional C3 convertase. Thus, the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb) is formed and is able to cleave C3 via its dimeric Bb subunit.

Since C3 convertases cleave C3 to produce C3b which can then form an additional C3 convertase through the alternative pathway, this is a potential mechanism of signal amplification in the complement cascade resulting in the deposition of large numbers of C3b molecules on the surface of activating particles, enabling opsonisation and acute local inflammation.

=== Classical and lectin pathways ===
The C3 convertase formed in the classical or lectin pathways is formed of C4b and C2b instead (NB: C2b, the larger fragment of C2 cleavage, was formerly known as C2a). The cleavage of C4 and C2 is mediated by serine proteases. In the classical pathway, this is by sequential proteolytic activation of proteins within the C1 complex (C1q, C1r, C1s) in response to binding to CRP or immunoglobulin, and in the lectin pathway it is driven by mannose binding lectin and its associated serine proteases (MASPs, particularly MASP2 but also MASP1).

C4 is homologous to C3 in that it contains an internal thioester bond that ends up on C4b. Thus it can form covalent amide or ester linkages with the plasma membrane of the pathogen and any associated antibodies, where it then behaves as an opsonin. The larger C2b produced by C2 hydrolysis attaches to the C4b to form the classical C3 convertase, C4b2b (formerly called C4b2a).

The smaller fragments of proteolysis, C4a and C2a are released. C4a is an anaphylatoxin.

==Regulation==
* C3 convertases are unstable (half-life 10 – 20 min) – respectively they are deactivated upon spontaneous dissociation or by facilitated dissociation mediated by the regulators of complement activation proteins decay accelerating factor (DAF), complement receptor 1 (CR1), C4b-binding protein and Factor H. Convertase assembly is suppressed by the proteolytic cleavage of C3b (and C4b) as mediated by Factor I in the presence of membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), C4b-binding protein, CR1, or a plasma-glycoprotein Factor H. These negative control processes are essential for the protection of self-tissue.
* Properdin (Factor P) is the only known positive regulator of complement activation that stabilizes the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb). Properdin deficient individuals are sensitive to pyogenic infections. Properdin also promotes association of C3b with Factor B and thus it inhibits the Factor H mediated cleavage of C3b by Factor I.

Nevertheless, this positive feedback mechanism can be regulated by binding of the control protein, nonproteolytic glycoprotein β1H (factor H), to C3b, which prevents association of factor B, and facilitates the decay-dissociation of Bb in the C3bBb complex, in addition to enhancing proteolytic inactivation of C3b by C3b inactivator (C3bINA – endopeptidase).

Membrane-associated sialic acid promotes high-affinity binding of β1H to C3b without influencing the affinity of B for C3b.

Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is another negative regulator of C3 convertase. It is a membrane protein and regulates also C5 convertase of the classical and alternative pathway. DAF protects host cells from damage by autologous complement. DAF acts on C2b and Bb and dissociates them rapidly from C4b and C3b – thereby preventing the assembly of the C3 convertase.

C4 binding protein (C4BP) interferes with the assembly of the membrane-bound C3 convertase of the classical pathway. C4BP is a cofactor for the enzyme C3bINA. C4b-binding protein inhibits the haemolytic function of cell-bound C4b. C4b-binding protein and C3b inactivator control the C3 convertase of the classical pathway in a similar way to that described for β1H and C3b inactivator in the alternative pathway.

C3b has different binding site for C3bINA, β1H, factor B and properdin. Binding β1H to C3b increases C3bINA binding, while factor B binding prevents C3bINA binding and is competitive with β1H binding.

Regulation of the amplification phase of the alternative pathway is exerted by multiple mechanisms:
*Intrinsic decay of C3 convertase
*Stabilization of C3 convertase by properdin
*Disassembly of this enzyme by serum glycoprotein β1H
*Inactivation of C3b
*Protection of C3 convertase from the activation of these control proteins afforded by the surface properties of certain cells and other activators of the alternative pathway.

== Location on chromosome ==
The genes encoding C2, C4 and factor B are located on chromosome 6 between the B locus of class I products and the D locus of class II products in the MHC.

<text>The Tekapo River flows occasionally through the Mackenzie Basin, Canterbury, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, although the riverbed is now often dry in the upper reaches. It maintains a constant flow below the confluence of several tributaries, notably the Maryburn, Forks, and Grays rivers.

The lower reaches (below the Maryburn confluence) are popular with anglers chasing brown and rainbow trout, although recent infestation by the invasive algae didymo (&quot;Didymosphenia geminata&quot;) has somewhat limited angling opportunities.
Originally, the river flowed southwest for from the southern end of Lake Tekapo before joining with the Pukaki River and flowing into the northern end of Lake Benmore.

However, the water from Lake Tekapo is now diverted via a canal to Lake Pukaki as part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme. These lakes are used to store water, and occasionally during a particularly heavy snow melt or if the power stations or canal need servicing, water may spilt from either the dam or canal back into the riverbed.

These events are much anticipated by kayakers, to the extent that they have been known to re-shape parts of the riverbed to create &quot;better&quot; rapids.

In 2020, there were warnings of potential water spill. Normally, its summer maximum level is set at 709.8 meters above the sea level whereas it reached 709.9m at one point.

Originally, the river flowed southwest for from the southern end of Lake Pukaki before joining with the Tekapo River and flowing into the northern end of Lake Benmore. However, all water from Lake Pukaki is now diverted into a canal which is fed through three hydroelectric stations before being returned directly into Lake Benmore, as part of the Waitaki Hydroelectric scheme. Occasionally, water may be spilled down the riverbed when Lake Pukaki reaches its maximum height, or if a canal or power station requires servicing.

In 2010, Meridian Energy applied for resource consents to build a 35 MW power station at Pukaki&#x27;s gate 18. Consent was granted for the project in July 2011. Consent for the project expires in 2021.

<doc id="1148029" wikidata="Q4812481" url="?curid=1148029" title="At the Club (album)">
<text>At the Club is the debut studio album by the British band Kenickie. It was released in 1997 and reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;At the Club&quot; includes the singles &quot;Punka&quot;, &quot;Millionaire Sweeper&quot;, &quot;In Your Car&quot;, &quot;Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Come Out 2nite&quot;, the lead track from the group&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Skillex&quot;. &quot;How I Was Made&quot; and an earlier stage of recording of &quot;Acetone&quot; also previously appeared on &quot;Skillex&quot;; the latter recording had also been used as part of an acoustic Peel Session in February 1996 and therefore appears on the band&#x27;s BBC &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; CD.

The album was produced by John Cornfield, Andy Carpenter and band member Peter Gofton (Johnny X). Receiving good reviews, the album was first released by Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs&#x27;s label EMIdisc in the UK on CD, cassette and LP on 12 May 1997. The album was released the following month in the US by Warner Bros. with an additional two tracks. The front cover photograph was taken by Warren Du Preez.

==Critical reception==
In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;At the Club&quot; as the 23rd-best Britpop album, with staff writer Jazz Monroe commenting that Kenickie&#x27;s &quot;synth-dappled guitar-pop was deceptively vulnerable, a strange cocktail of elation and deflation&quot;, and adding, &quot;Their songwriting sketched an alternative to girl power&#x27;s individualist rush: Instead of assuming an audience with the tools to empower itself, Kenickie showed hedonism to be a release valve, something fought for and snatched from the daily grind on scrappy nights out.&quot;

<text>The Rhymney Railway (RR) was a railway company in South Wales, founded to transport minerals and materials to and from collieries and ironworks in the Rhymney Valley of South Wales, and to docks in Cardiff. It opened a main line in 1858, and a limited passenger service was operated in addition.

The first line was dependent on the cooperation of the parallel Taff Vale Railway (TVR) for part of the transit, and this relationship was uneasy; the Rhymney Railway built an independent line to Cardiff in 1871. Better relations were created with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), and later the Great Western Railway (GWR), and two important joint lines with the GWR were built: the Taff Bargoed line (1876) and the Quakers Yard and Merthyr Joint line (1882).

Although the Rhymney Railway network was never large, it was remarkably profitable, and paid excellent dividends for most of its life. Dependent on mineral traffic for its own success, it declined in the 1970s, but the main line from to remains in heavy use as a local passenger line.

==Before the Rhymney Railway==

The head of the River Taff valley, at Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, was the scene of huge expansion of industrial iron founding from 1760 onwards. All the ingredients were close at hand: iron ore, coal, timber and limestone. One particular resource needed to be provided, and that was transport to market. For some time this was done on the backs of animals; the road system was extremely poor in the area, and the provision of a turnpike helped, but pack animal transport was nonetheless expensive.

Canals were built: the Glamorganshire Canal and the Monmouthshire Canal. Tramroads were already in existence to bring the minerals to the ironworks, and now they could be built to convey the finished product to the canals. The authorising acts of Parliament for the canals included clauses empowering pit owners to build a connecting tramroad to the canals if the canal company failed to do so, provided the pit was within a certain distance of the canal. Compensation was to be paid to landowners over whose property the tramroad might pass, but no further legislative authority needed to be sought.

In 1800 the iron-founding industry was established at Rhymney, and this encouraged the inclusion in the Monmouthshire Canal Navigation Act 1802 (42 Geo. 3. c. cxv) of a tramroad connecting Nantybwch to the Union Iron Works in Rhymney. There were soon several ironworks in the immediate area, and a small network of tramroads developed to serve them. In 1815 the Bryn Oer Tramway was opened, connecting the ironworks northward to Trefil and on over the hills to Talybont, where a connection was made with the Abergavenny Canal.

In 1825 the Rumney Railway was incorporated. It is usually referred to as the &quot;Old Rumney Railway&quot;, and had no organisational connection with the later Rhymney Railway. It opened about 1826, running from Rhymney to Pye Corner, on the margin of modern Newport, where it joined the Sirhowy tramroad.

The conveyance of the output of the ironworks at Merthyr and Dowlais remained a serious issue, and eventually, in 1840, the Taff Vale Railway was built as the solution to the problem. In that year and the following year the line was completed between Merthyr and Cardiff Docks. Then in 1847 the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway opened its Taff Vale Extension Railway, a long route from Pontypool in the east to Crumlin in the west at first, then extended into the Aberdare valley intersecting many valleys and connecting with many railways.

In 1850 the South Wales Railway opened part of its main line, between Chepstow and Swansea. This was built to the broad gauge and was intended as a trunk railway, connecting the network of the Great Western Railway with Milford Haven, and running through Cardiff.

==Rhymney Railway proposed==
The Taff Vale Railway had a branch line to Llancaiach, where there were productive collieries. This spate of railway building in South Wales, mirroring that in England, encouraged thoughts of a railway serving the Rhymney ironworks. An agreement was reached with the Taff Vale Railway that it would convey the Rhymney traffic over its line from Llancaiach. Separate dock facilities at Cardiff would be provided, at what became Bute East Dock.
A bill for the Rhymney Railway went to Parliament in the 1854 session and received royal assent on 24 July 1854 as the (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. cxciii). It was to build a railway from the Rhymney ironworks, down the west bank of the River Rhymney, to a junction with the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway near Hengoed. This main line was to be long, and there was also to be a branch from Pont Aberbargoed up the Bargoed Rhymney valley to Ysgwyddgwyn. Share capital was to be £100,000.

The maritime destination which the line was to reach was described in the act as &quot;the ports [plural] of the Bristol Channel&quot; and the armorial bearing of the company included the coast of arms both of Cardiff and Newport, although no reason has been recorded for the Newport connection.

The connection to the NA&amp;HR at Llancaiach was refused on account of objection by that company, so the Rhymney Railway was without the route to the docks that it sought. It returned to Parliament the following year. It almost doubled its extent by obtaining an act of Parliament giving sanction to build on from Hengoed to Walnut Tree Bridge, joining the Taff Vale Railway near Taff&#x27;s Well, a line of , with a branch to Caerphilly and a branch connecting north to west on to the NA&amp;HR at Hengoed. In addition there was a branch from Crockherbtown Junction, immediately north of the present Cardiff Queen Street station, to the Bute Dock. Running powers were granted over the Taff Vale Railway between Walnut Tree Bridge and Crockherbtown Junction.
The authorised share capital was more than doubled, an additional £130,000 being authorised by this second act of Parliament of 2 July 1855, the (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. cx).

The engineer for the works was Joseph Cubitt; the Earl of Bute was the owner of the Bute Docks and his trustees built the branch to the docks, leasing it to the Rhymney Railway at 4% on capital of £67,633.

Construction proceeded but the cost of the work proved to be considerably underestimated, and in 1857 an act of Parliament giving authority was obtained to increase the share capital to £300,000. The Bute Docks branch was the first to be completed, being ready in September 1857, although the Rhymney Railway itself was not yet in a position to make use of it; some Taff Vale Railway traffic passed over it.

The approach to the junction with the TVR at Walnut Tree involved excavating a cutting to the extent of of earth.

==Opening of the line==
Thursday 25 February 1858 was fixed for the opening: 24 wagons loaded with 150 tons of Rhymney iron formed the first train, followed by a second of 40 mineral wagons containing 240 tons. The line was single-track throughout.

Passenger traffic started on 31 March 1858. There were two trains each way daily, taking 90 minutes for the from Cardiff to Rhymney. Three weeks later the service was augmented to three passenger trains each way daily. The Cardiff station was at , and the trains ran non-stop from there to ; from there the stations were , , , , , and . At Hengoed the trains made connections with the Taff Vale Extension line trains.

The Caerphilly branch was opened in 1859.

From the outset the company was in difficulty. The capital expenditure had far exceeded the budget for the work, and interest and other prior charges exceeded the net income, particularly as mineral traffic did not develop as rapidly as had been hoped. Friction developed with the Taff Vale Railway from an early date, and the Rhymney&#x27;s dependency on the TVR for working its traffic over the TVR main line left the Rhymney vulnerable.

The Bute Trustees approached the Rhymney company with an offer: to lease the undertaking for 250 years retrospectively from 1 January 1860; to deal with all prior charges and in addition pay 5% on the ordinary stock from the beginning of 1865, rising gradually to that figure in the meantime. This offer was remarkably advantageous to the Rhymney&#x27;s proprietors, but in 1860 and again in 1861 Parliament refused to sanction the arrangement, and the Rhymney Railway was left to resolve its problems alone.

==Financial strains==
Frustrated with the difficulties of operating over the TVR into Cardiff, the Rhymney Railway submitted a bill in the 1861 session to build an independent line between Walnut Tree and Cardiff, but this failed in committee, although a further extension of authorised capital was permitted. The Bute Trustees evidently wished the Rhymney Railway to succeed, for they now agreed &quot;in consideration of the capitalisation of the rent due to them&quot; that dividends and other interest payments should have precedence over their own financial claims. The Bute Trustees were already giving the Rhymney company considerably better terms for using the dock than they had granted to the Taff Vale Railway; this was a sore point with the TVR company.
From 1862 the profitability of the company eased a little and a modest dividend was paid. However the operating difficulties over the TVR section only became worse; and in 1863 the Rhymney Railway submitted a bill to make the direct line to Cardiff from Caerphilly. On 25 July 1864, the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cclxiv) was passed, with further capital of £210,000. The running powers between Walnut Tree and Cardiff would be extinguished, except for traffic to the new docks at Penarth, from the date of opening of the direct line. A separate act of Parliament on the same day gave permission for a short stub to make a connection east of Caerphilly with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway&#x27;s Caerphilly branch.

In fact the construction of the line proved very difficult at a time when money was becoming very scarce; as well as labour problems the Caerphilly Tunnel gave exceptional difficulty. At in length it was a hard drive, and an unknown spring in the middle during construction proved difficult to get under control.

==Brecon and Merthyr Railway==
In 1859 the Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil Junction Railway (B&amp;MR) had been incorporated, to build a line from the north at Brecon, into Merthyr Tydfil, Dowlais and Rhymney. At first this appeared to complement the Rhymney Railway&#x27;s activity, but the mood gradually changed and in 1863 the B&amp;MR acquired the Old Rumney Railway, with the obvious intention of reaching the docks at Newport and competing directly with the Rhymney Railway. In self-defence the Rhymney Railway, seeing this coming, had obtained Parliamentary powers for a Bargoed Rhymney branch line, covering pretty much the same terrain as the B&amp;MR intentions.

The wasteful competition was abated when the two companies agreed reluctantly to cooperate. The Rhymney Railway built the southern part of the route from Bargoed to Deri Junction, there to form an end-on junction with the B&amp;MR line. (The location was later the site of station.) The Rhymney&#x27;s part of the line opened in March 1864. The B&amp;MR was approaching from the north, and was ready for traffic in 1865, but legal complications prevented actual opening until March 1868.

Mutual running powers were agreed, in the Rhymney&#x27;s case as far as Pantywaun Junction, above Deri (where the Dowlais Ironworks railway system made a junction with the B&amp;MR line), although in practice they were only used as far as Fochriw Colliery.

The Deri branch of the Rhymney Railway was doubled in 1909.

==London and North Western Railway==
The Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway was building its line across the heads of the valleys, giving an exit for Merthyr and Dowlais iron to the industrial Midlands and North of England over the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway and associated companies further north. The London and North Western Railway had certain rights over the NA&amp;HR line, and seeing now an opportunity to get access to South Wales, it acquired a lease of the MT&amp;AR in 1862. By 1864 the LNWR had pushed as far west as Nantybwch.
The LNWR was friendly towards the Rhymney Railway and a physical connection was obviously desirable, so the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cclxxv) of 25 July 1864 authorised a line northward from Rhymney to Nantybwch on the MT&amp;AR.

The Rhymney Railway and the LNWR agreed to construct the connecting line jointly, and running powers were granted to the Rhymney along the MT&amp;AR as far as Ebbw Vale, although in practice these were not used. The LNWR did well out of the exchange of running powers, receiving the right to run to Cardiff and Penarth over the RR system, although this required the acquiescence of the Taff Vale Railway, which was not easily obtained.

The line was opened formally on 5 September 1871, although the public opening was not until 2 October 1871. The line climbed at 1 in 35 to station, and from there to the joint line was part of the MT&amp;AR. The LNWR immediately made use of the route to get access to Cardiff for general goods traffic; until this time it had passed via Newport, being transshipped there to broad gauge wagons as the former South Wales Railway route was still broad gauge.

The LNWR now carried a lot of traffic to Cardiff and soon was receiving complaints that it had inadequate warehousing facilities there; it responded by building its own goods station at Tyndall Street.

==Taff Bargoed Line==

In 1867 the Rhymney Railway was considering how it might reach Dowlais and Merthyr directly. The trade in the iron industry was changing, and no longer was locally extracted iron ore dominant in the iron foundries of Dowlais: imported ore was being used to an increasing extent, and being hauled up the gradient from the coastal ports. The obvious route appeared to be the Taff Bargoed valley, as yet without railway access. At the same time the Great Western Railway had a corresponding idea, and on 29 March 1867 the Rhymney and the GWR agreed to build the line jointly. This was ratified by an act of Parliament of 12 August 1867. There was to be a generous exchange of running powers.

It was to run from a junction near Llancaiach on the Taff Vale Extension line, to Dowlais (Cae Harris), a distance of , making a connection there with the tramroad network of the Dowlais Iron Company.

There were serious labour difficulties in constructing the line, however, and it did not open until 10 January 1876. A short branch from Cwm Bargoed on the Taff Bargoed line to Fochriw Colliery was opened as part of the works. At Dowlais, as well as connecting directly to the Dowlais Iron Company&#x27;s network, the new railway had a branch known as the Zig-zag Branch on the south-west side of Dowlais; the zig-zag climbed at 1 in 35 to gain height to reach another part of the Dowlais complex.

Much of the main line of the Taff Bargoed line climbed to Dowlais at 1 in 40 and 1 in 49, against loaded traffic. The summit on the line is at an altitude of above sea level. The stations on the line were and but halts were built later for the Bedlinog, Nantwen, Nantyffin and Penydarren collieries.

==Caerphilly to Cardiff line opened==
On 1 April 1871 the Rhymney Railway was at last able to open its own direct Caerphilly to Cardiff line. It had a falling gradient all the way to Cardiff, where it made a junction with its own line to the Bute Docks. It was double track.

Crockherbtown junction had been the point of divergence of the Taff Vale Railway and the Rhymney lines to the docks. Now the new line joined in there, but without the facility of running direct from Caerphilly to the TVR docks. The Cardiff station at Adam Street was closed to passengers, and a new Cardiff station, , north of the present-day was established. The TVR Cardiff station was on the south side of the thoroughfare.

==Ystrad Mynach to Penalltau Junction==
In 1871 another, short branch was opened: it was from Ystrad Mynach on the Rhymney main line to Penalltau Junction on the Taff Vale Extension line. By this time the Great Western Railway had taken over the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (through its successor, the West Midland Railway) so the Taff Vale Extension was GWR territory. The line had been extended to Middle Duffryn in the Aberdare Valley, and connected there with the Vale of Neath Railway, also now controlled by the GWR. As part of the deal when the Taff Bargoed line was agreed with the GWR, the Rhymney Railway had secured running powers through Aberdare to Hirwaun.

The new line would therefore give it access, from Ystrad Mynach, to the hugely expanding mineral resources of the Aberdare region, as well as to the Taff Bargoed line at a junction near Llancaiach. The line opened on 27 September 1871.

==Congestion, and doubling the line==
Apart from the new Cardiff to Caerphilly line, the Rhymney Railway was all single track, and the massive expansion of mineral traffic was becoming difficult to handle, leading to complaints about passenger train delays. The company was forced to double the line between Caerphilly and Ystrad Mynach in 1872, and other expensive improvements, as well as enhancements to the locomotive fleet, had to follow.

==The Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway==
Newport Docks had long been dominant in the area, and had been expanding continuously for some time. The owners naturally wished to maximise the mineral traffic through their docks, and were held back by the difficult connection from the Taff Vale.

On 25 July 1884 the Pontypridd Caerphilly and Newport Railway was opened, encouraged by the Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway. It formed a junction with the Taff Vale Railway near Pontypridd, and connected to Newport by running powers over the Rhymney Railway and the Brecon and Merthyr Railway. The Rhymney part of that was a relatively short transit from Penrhos Junction through Caerphilly to an end-on junction with the B&amp;M east of Caerphilly.

The Rhymney had to improve its Caerphilly–Penrhos Junction line, which had not been kept up to a standard suited to passenger work since its own trains over this line had ceased in 1871.

The RR and the LNWR got running powers to Pontypridd, and the PC&amp;NR got running powers into Cardiff over the Rhymney Railway. The Rhymney&#x27;s powers to Pontypridd were rendered unusable by the obstructive attitude of the TVR.

==Quakers Yard and Merthyr Joint Line==
A further joint venture with the Great Western Railway led to Merthyr Tydfil. Although the GWR already had a presence at Merthyr through the Vale of Neath line, up to that point the Taff Vale Railway had a monopoly of the direct routes from Merthyr to the south and east.

Now the Quakers Yard and Merthyr line was opened on 1 April 1886 from the Taff Vale Extension line at Quakers Yard running up the west side of the River Taff to Merthyr, ending at the GWR station there. Colliery and ironstone pit connections were made intermediately, and a branch line spur crossed the Taff to get access to the important Merthyr Vale colliery.

There was already a railway running part of the way down the west bank: the private Gethin Railway belonging to the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, and this could be latched onto in the vicinity of Abercanaid, and a simple spur provided where it crossed the GWR Hirwain line to bring the joint trains into Merthyr High Street station.

The line opened for passenger traffic on 1 April 1886, trains using the High Street station at Merthyr. The new line crossed over the Taff Vale line and the Glamorganshire Canal shortly after leaving Quakers Yard GWR (later High Level) station, and at nearly south there was a branch on the east side to the Merthyr Vale group of coal pits, crossing the river on a long steel viaduct. There were stations at and , and the service was worked by the Rhymney company. At Cyfarthfa Level Crossing Junction, where the spur to the former Vale of Neath line ran round Glyndyris Pond, the private Gethin Railway ran straight on to the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, with a branch to the east running up to the Ynys Fach works, and Rhymney goods trains and workmen&#x27;s trains ran up to Cyfarthfa Furnace Tops.

The QY&amp;MR Joint Line crossed the river Taff immediately after leaving Quakers Yard station. The near collapse of the viaduct over the river was the cause of the termination of the passenger operation on the QY&amp;M line in February 1951.

The line above Merthyr Vale was singled in 1952.

==Aber branch (Senghenydd)==

On 1 February 1894 the branch, to Senghenydd, at the head of a steep valley formed by the Nant-yr-aber stream, was opened. This line of was constructed to serve collieries that were developing in the valley; it had been authorised by the (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. cxxxiii) of 25 July 1890.

 of track had been laid up the valley in 1865 to serve the Tir Gibbon and Hendredenny collieries. By an act of Parliament of 25 July 1890 this was to be converted into a proper branch line for goods and passengers, the sponsors being the Windsor Steam Coal Company and the Lewis Merthyr Consolidated Collieries. There was a passing place at Abertridwr, near where the Windsor colliery was sunk. From Penyrheol, from Aber, there was a continuous climb starting at 1 in 58 and steepening to 1 in 49 near the terminus, which comprised a station, extensive colliery sidings and a locomotive shed.

Passenger traffic ceased in 1964. The line continued to serve Windsor Colliery at Abertridwr until 30 June 1977 when an underground link was opened between the colliery and Nantgarw Colliery which was served by a branch from the Cardiff-Pontypridd line. The line closed on 5 September 1977.

==Cylla branch==

On 30 May 1895 the Cylla branch was authorised by the (58 &amp; 59 Vict. c. xxxv). It took some time to be made ready, the first section opening on 1 August 1906, serving a Powell Duffryn colliery. The complete branch did not open until 1909. It diverged from the Rhymney main line at , occupying the fork between the main line and the Penalltau line, and running northwards to Cylla and Penrhiwfelin, a total of . The line was for mineral traffic only and never carried passengers, but there was a miners&#x27; service.

Ordnance Survey maps for 1919, 1921–22 and 1938 show a at the head of the branch.

The line closed in 1991 after the end of coal winning at Penallta Colliery.

==Barry Railway==
In 1896 the Barry Railway began an invasion of the Rhymney Railway&#x27;s territory. It had been opened with the object of providing competition for the mineral traffic of Cardiff Docks and the Taff Vale Railway, which together suffered from severe congestion, and in the view of their customers, high rates and poor service. The Barry founded new docks at Barry itself, and opened a line from the Rhondda to Barry in 1889.

On 7 August 1896 the Barry Railway got an act of Parliament for a Rhymney branch; it was to be a prodigious extension, running form a junction with its main line near St Fagans, turning northeast and crossing the River Taff near Taff&#x27;s Well, following closely the original line of the Rhymney Railway to Penrhos Upper Junction, and then striking north and crossing the Rhymney valley to join the Brecon and Merthyr Railway.

The Barry Railway&#x27;s Rhymney branch opened for freight traffic on 1 August 1901. The further line to cross the valley and join the B&amp;M line was opened for goods and mineral traffic on 2 January 1905. Three years later,  million tons of coal were taken from the Rhymney system down to Barry.

The Barry Railway had asked for running powers over the Rhymney Railway and over the Taff Bargoed Joint line but these were refused, except for powers into Caerphilly station.

The Barry&#x27;s new line opened for goods and mineral traffic on 1 August 1901, but in the meantime, on 25 July 1896, the Barry had returned to Parliament for even more ambitious powers: to continue the line from Penrhos Junction to join the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, by crossing the Rhymney Valley by a large viaduct at Pwll-y-pant.

This extension line opened for goods and mineral traffic on 2 January 1905.

==Railmotors==
The Taff Vale Railway introduced what it called &quot;motor cars&quot; (that is, railmotors) in 1905. These were single coaches incorporating a small steam engine integrated with the coach. The intention was to enable station calls at low-cost structures in rural areas.

The Rhymney Railway observed the considerable success of the Taff Vale scheme, and in 1907 procured two such vehicles from Hudswell Clarke to its own design; the steam engine part was a small 0-4-0 tank engine with wheels. The carriage part was supplied by Cravens. There were soon complaints of unsteady running, and a trailing axle was added to the locomotive unit, with wheels.

Several small halts were put up to make use of these cars, but the vehicles were not a success; one was rebuilt in 1910, making a separate carriage and engine. The other was used until 1919 on the Penrhiwfelin workmen&#x27;s train, and then modified in the same way as the other.

==Westinghouse brake==
When the Company incorporated a continuous brake into its train working, it adopted the Westinghouse brake for passenger trains. This was the only use of the Westinghouse system in Wales, except the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways. However, for a long time the Eames non-continuous vacuum brake was used on many of the mineral engines.

==Cardiff Railway==

The Bute Docks system wished to operate railways outside the dock area, where it had an extensive system, and it formed the Cardiff Railway for the purpose.

On 1 March 1911 the Cardiff Railway started to run a railmotor passenger service over their newly built line to Rhydyfelin. For this purpose the Rhymney station at Cardiff was used, together with of line as far as Heath South, at which point the Cardiff Railway trains reached their own system.

==After 1922==
Most of the railways of Great Britain were &quot;grouped&quot; in 1922–23, following the Railways Act 1922. They were formed into one or other of four new large companies, and in the area under consideration that was the Great Western Railway. The Rhymney Railway was a constituent of the new GWR.

This took place from January 1922, although the Amalgamation tribunal did not give assent until 25 March, this was the official date.

In the final year of operation a dividend of 9 per cent on the Ordinary shares was maintained, as it had been since 1916. The following are the figures for 1921:

==From 1948==
In 1948 the Great Western Railway was nationalised, in common with other main line railways in Great Britain.

For some years the mineral operation that had always been the primary business of the Rhymney Railway continued, but over later decades coal extraction in South Wales declined, steeply in the early 1980s.

At the same time local passenger operation increased in importance, notwithstanding substantial improvements to the road network in the valleys. The difficult road access to Cardiff itself, and general traffic congestion in the city, were advantageous to the Rhymney line, particularly as access from Caerphilly south was through the tunnel.

 there is a frequent local passenger service on the Rhymney Railway&#x27;s main line, from to via and .

Practically all freight operation on the system has disappeared; a very limited residual service to Cwmbargoed may still be in operation.

A new station called was opened on 4 November 1986, replacing , a little-used golfing halt, which closed on 27 September.

The buildings of the former station were demolished in 1989.

The part of the original main line between Taff&#x27;s Well and Caerphilly, informally referred to as &quot;the Big Hill&quot;, was closed on 21 June 1982, although the last train was a special on 23 October 1982.

The Taff Bargoed branch had (at station) the short Ocean Branch for Deep Navigation and Taff Merthyr collieries and Trelewis Drift mine, and in October 1983 the line between Cwmbargoed and Dowlais Furnace Top closed.

Trelewis closed in 1989 when British Coal invested in opencast operations at Cwmbargoed.

Deep Navigation Mine closed in March 1991 but removal of surface stock continued by rail until January 1992. In October 1992 Taff Merthyr colliery closed.

==Officers==
Cornelius Lundie, from the outset of the line and for more than 40 years, was General Manager, Traffic Manager and Superintendent of the line. Upon his retirement in 1904, the Rhymney did a spring cleaning, which notably included the scrapping of his favourite engine, which he had been preserving for a number of years.

===Locomotive Superintendents===
*Thomas Clements (1858–1862)
*Matthew Mordue (1862–1863)
*John Kendall (1863–1869)
*John Canty (1869–1884)
*Richard Jenkins (1884–1906)
*C. T. Hurry Riches (1906–1922)

C. T. Hurry Riches was the son of Tom Hurry Riches, Locomotive Superintendent of the Taff Vale Railway (1873–1910). Kendall had an unfortunately short career with the Rhymney, which was cut short when he visited the Brecon and Merthyr Railway on 10 June 1869. The locomotive, upon which Kendall was travelling, overturned at Maesycwmmer, killing him and his B&amp;MR counterpart, J.T. Simpson.

==Locomotives==
===Early locomotives===
The early locomotives were tender engines, whether for passenger or goods:
* 0-6-0 Vulcan Foundry 1857: inside frames; freight
* 2-4-0 Vulcan Foundry 1858, 1861: passenger locomotives
* 0-6-0 Kitson 1859-1868: double frames, outside cranks; freight
* 0-6-0 ST 1872 onwards: various builders. All Rhymney locomotives from then were of this type.
**Notes taken from &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; February 1923

===Later locomotives===
* Rhymney Railway A class 0-6-2T
* Rhymney Railway B class 0-6-0WT
* Rhymney Railway I class 0-6-0ST
* Rhymney Railway K class 0-6-2ST
* Rhymney Railway L class 2-4-2ST
* Rhymney Railway L1 class 0-6-2ST
* Rhymney Railway M class 0-6-2T
* Rhymney Railway P class 0-6-2T
* Rhymney Railway R class 0-6-2T
* Rhymney Railway S class 0-6-0T
* Rhymney Railway S1 class 0-6-0T

Several original Rhymney Railway coaches have survived into the present day. Coaches No.95 and 109 stand in private residence. An unidentified six-wheel brake also resides in storage with the National Museums &amp; Galleries of Wales. Only one wagon, a goods van, is known to still exist today, stored at the National Museum of Wales.

No locomotives exist in current preservation.

<doc id="1148043" wikidata="Q4115061" url="?curid=1148043" title="New Zealand cuisine">
<text>The cuisine of New Zealand is largely driven by local ingredients and seasonal variations. As an island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. Similar to the cuisine of Australia, the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean and Pacific Rim influences as the country has become more cosmopolitan.

Historical influences came from British cuisine and Māori culture. Since the 1970s, new cuisines such as New American cuisine, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian have become popular.

==Māori cuisine==

When the Māori arrived in New Zealand from tropical Polynesia, they brought a number of food plants, including , taro, purple yam, and , most of which grew well only in the north of the North Island. Kūmara could be grown as far south as the northern South Island, and became a staple food as it could be stored over the winter. Native New Zealand plants such as fernroot became a more important part of the diet, along with insects such as the huhu grub. Earthworms, called , are a part of the traditional Māori diet as well. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. The large, flightless moa was soon hunted to extinction for food and tools as well. Rāhui, or resource restrictions, included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year to allow populations to be maintained. Seafood consumed included or freshwater crayfish, or abalone, and or bluff oysters. The discovery of &quot;Typha orientalis&quot; led to the creation of a gritty unleavened bread made laboriously from its dried pollen called &quot;pungapunga&quot;.

Similar to other Polynesian people, Māori cooked food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as hāngī, although the word is also used. Stones are heated by fire and food packed in leaves placed on top. These packs are then covered with foliage, cloth, or wet sacks, and then a layer of earth. Other cooking methods included roasting, boiling or steaming using geothermal heated water, and cooking over an open fire.

Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, fermentation, or layers of fat—particularly muttonbirds.

Māori were one of the few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage.

===Food and religion===
In traditional Māori religion food was noa, or non-sacred. This meant care had to be taken to prevent it from coming into contact with tapu places or objects. If it did, the tapu of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be at risk. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food, with the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party&#x27;s waka.

===European influences===
When Europeans (Pākehā) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially pork and potatoes, were quickly adopted by Māori. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in a similar way to kūmara but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as wheat, pumpkin, mutton, sugar, and many types of fruit also became a part of the Māori diet and were widely traded with visiting ships. American sailors brought new varieties of kūmara to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kūmara. (Today, most kūmara are the commercial varieties: Owairaka Red, Toka Toka Gold and Beauregard.) The introduction of maize (&quot;kōpakipaki&quot; or &quot;kānga&quot;) led to the creation of a meal called &quot;kōpiro&quot; which involves submerging corn cobs under running water to ferment before its kernels are scraped off and formed into cakes to roast or steam. A coffee and spice merchant of European descent, David Strang, invented instant coffee in Invercargill in 1890. The drink quickly spread around New Zealand and then around the world.

Alcohol, initially rejected as (stinking water), also became acceptable in Māori life. Most Māori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the Māori food industry declined in the mid-nineteenth century because of land loss and competition from settler farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the kererū (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarce as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted.

===Māori cuisine today===

Present day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, old-fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Some Māori names for consumables, like pāua (also prized for its shell), have entered common New Zealand English usage. 

Most large Māori gatherings feature a hāngī, which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by Māori and by pākehā. In recent decades, there has been much concern that Māori are disproportionately likely to suffer from obesity, heart disease, and diabetes as a result of eating habits.

Two dishes regarded as distinctively Māori are the boil up—made of pork, potatoes, kūmara, and dumplings—and pork and pūhā (sow thistle), which combine introduced and indigenous foods. Both dishes owe much to nineteenth-century British cooking methods.

Another distinctive food is &quot;rēwena&quot; or &quot;Māori bread&quot;, which is made with fermented potatoes. The 2020 cookbook &quot;Hiakai&quot; by chef Monique Fiso, academic Tracy Berno and food writer Lucy Corry describes the history, development and tikanga of modern Māori food.

A dish served during Matariki feasts or at hākari (feasts) on the marae is parāoa parai (fry bread). They are described as crispy and golden brown on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

==New Zealand European cuisine==
The majority of New Zealanders are Pākehā of British descent, so British cuisine has been very influential.

===British Isles settler food===
Nineteenth-century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. They ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing tea and beer using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the New Zealand British population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid-1980s was colonial goose, a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for goose. A major difference between British and New Zealand British food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth-century Britain, labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high-status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it.

Like the British, New Zealand British have traditionally preferred sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes celebrate important occasions, reflected through cakes, scones, muffins and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country&#x27;s most iconic recipe book, the &quot;Edmonds Cookery Book&quot;, originally began as publicity material for a baking powder company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.

===From Antipodean British fare to Asia-Pacific fusion===
For most of the twentieth century, New Zealand cuisine remained highly derivative of British food. Unlike Britain, New Zealand escaped major food shortages during World War II. However, demands of the US forces in the Pacific as well as exports to Britain saw meat and butter rationed between 1943 and 1950. From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Many New Zealanders went to Europe on overseas experience where they encountered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of Britain as well as the New British cuisine. When they returned home they helped create a demand for better-quality food and more variety. They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with hāngī and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s joining of the European Economic Community (EEC) (now the European Union) in 1973 sounded the death knell of New Zealand&#x27;s identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted. During this period, certain non-British or Irish European dishes, such as beef bourguignon, had shed the &#x27;ethnic&#x27; connotation and entered mainstream New Zealand cooking. The 1970s also saw major changes in take-away food with the arrival of the first American fast-food chains: Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in 1971, Pizza Hut in 1974, and McDonald&#x27;s in 1976.

The 1980s was marked with economic liberalisation dubbed Rogernomics (named for the then-Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas) that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find alternative means of survival. Many chose to produce specialty cheese types like Havarti, Brie and Stilton, or diversified into growing olives or grapes instead of traditional meat and dairy farming. Avocado oil for cooking was commercialised in New Zealand in 1999 by a group of growers based in the Tauranga region.

Rogernomics also abolished most import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allowed hitherto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine serrano ham from Spain, extra virgin olive oil from Italy, and mango from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs. These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand.

On top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly &#x27;foreign muck&#x27; cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status. New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower-middle-class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist David Veart, this period of sea change in New Zealand&#x27;s culinary culture was akin to &quot;being let out after a long school detention&quot;.

==Other cuisines in New Zealand==
People from many different backgrounds have settled in New Zealand, and many have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early Pākehā settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However, for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries.

The Immigration Act 1986 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia has greatly increased since. Many of these immigrants have brought their cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of Japanese, Thai, Malay, regional Chinese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines. Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by Pākehā and Māori New Zealanders. Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as kebabs, couscous, and sushi are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, antipasto, butter chicken, pad thai, pasta, such that they appear in home cooking, as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants.

Ingredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains. Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and sun-dried tomatoes, and to a lesser extent fish sauce and rice paper were already seen as ordinary ingredients by 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as exotic.

==Contemporary cuisine==
As a result of various developments, the cuisine of New Zealand in the 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan Pacific Rim fare&#x27;s reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating-out scenes, and traditional hearty settlers&#x27; food, now dubbed &#x27;Kwisine Kiwiana&#x27;, but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating-out scenes even in the most remote rural regions. Most of the home cooking prepared at households in Auckland is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of Mediterranean, Chinese, and Indian dishes. In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural Canterbury and the West Coast, however, traditional Kiwiana fare is still the norm at many homes. 

Certain vestiges of traditional Kiwiana dishes remain popular throughout the country, such as fish and chips, meat pies, custard squares, pavlova, and others. An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spearheaded by the popularity of the television series &quot;Kiwi Kitchen&quot; presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables. Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends. 

Concurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand diners and chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene. Many chefs had worked in Australia and endeavour to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well.

In general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia. The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as Mediterranean cookery, which did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of the 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s. While Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well-established niche specialist produce distributing channel, a similar system is still in its infancy across the Tasman. However, in recent times Auckland and Wellington have food fashions moving essentially in sync with that of Sydney and Melbourne.

One major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine café culture and disappearance of the traditional institution of tearooms at large. Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering cream tea, cakes, cucumber sandwiches, and pastries such as custard squares, with filtered coffee or tea as drinks. New Zealanders have copied the Mediterranean practise of drinking espresso-based coffees, but also invented instant coffee, which is now widely consumed around the world. In time, cafes became popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes. Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries. 

Vegetarianism had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years, but became more mainstream during the 1980s. However, despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with a decrease in red meat consumption, and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise due to their relative affordability compared to red meat. Annual meat consumption was per capita in 2019, comprising of chicken and other poultry, of pork, ham and bacon, of beef and veal, and of lamb and mutton.

==New Zealand cuisine in other countries==
Globally, New Zealand cuisine has little effect, although Australia does feel influences from New Zealand cuisine. The country&#x27;s well known culinary export, the pavlova, has been the object of a decades-long battle with Australia over where it was invented.

Fusion cuisine and foreign cuisine styles interact with modern New Zealand cuisine, with chefs from New Zealand actively learning overseas trends, and chefs like Peter Gordon, bakers such as Dean Brettschneider, and foodies such as Lauraine Jacobs influencing fusion cuisines derived from New Zealand cuisine. &quot;Cuisine&quot; magazine, first published in 1986, has earned global fame and is held in high prestige among the worldwide foodie communities.

==Alcoholic beverages==
New Zealand has a successful wine industry, with about 76 million litres being exported in the year to June 2007. The first vines are thought to have been introduced by missionary Samuel Marsden, and planted in 1817 by Charles Gordon, superintendent of agriculture for the missionaries, according to Dr Richard Smart who was viticultural editor of both editions of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Wine&quot;. Official British resident James Busby is credited with producing wine at Kerikeri in 1833, and Charles Darwin noted the winery in his diary when he visited Kerikeri in 1835.

Small vineyards were also planted by French settlers in Akaroa in the 1840s. However, wine was drunk in relatively small quantities well into the twentieth century, with the average per capita consumption only about 2.6 litres in 1966. The high price of imported wines probably prevented New Zealanders from developing a taste for wine, although it did help sales of local vintages. The quality of these wines slowly improved, with New Zealand wines winning three gold and 13 silver medals at the International Wine Fair in 1963. Aided by the deregulation of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic wine consumption increased and New Zealand wine won increasing accolades internationally.

There are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with Marlborough famed for its sauvignon blanc, Gisborne for its chardonnay, and Central Otago and Martinborough known for pinot noir and pinot gris. Hawkes Bay is known for its bold cabernets, and Auckland&#x27;s Waiheke Island is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawkes Bay are New Zealand&#x27;s two premium wine-growing regions.

Beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale. New Zealand is ranked 27th in beer consumption per capita, at around 64.7 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and between 4%–5% alcohol by volume. 
There are also over 100 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles. The two largest breweries in New Zealand, Lion Nathan and DB Breweries, control almost 90% of sales by volume between them. New Zealand is also a leading hops-producing nation with some of the most sought-after hops in the world.

==Patterns of eating==
Most New Zealanders eat their main meal—known as &#x27;dinner&#x27; or sometimes &#x27;tea&#x27;—in the evening. The move from midday to evening dinners began in the early 20th century, although the tradition of a midday dinner on Sunday remained well into the 1960s. In 1962, a nationwide food survey reported 75% of households normally ate their main meal in the evening, but over 50% of households ate their Sunday main meal at midday. The survey was repeated in 1982, by which time 83% of households ate their main meal in the evening, and only 21% of households ate their Sunday main meal at midday.

In the summer, barbecues have become popular since the late 20th century, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer or wine, and on occasion meat, which the host will cook. Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. Traditionally, the men cook the meat. Many gardens are designed with special areas for barbecuing. Similar Māori gatherings will often feature a hāngī, a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top and covered with damp cloth or leaves. Water is added before the hole is quickly covered with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whānau) help out for such a feast.

Many New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as &#x27;bring a plate&#x27; (potluck) in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are &#x27;BYO&#x27; (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared.
New Zealand&#x27;s dining-out culture developed strongly in the 1960s, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws (in 1961) and popularisation of cafés and other similar casual dining establishments. It is common for people to visit cafés regularly for lunch or morning or afternoon snacks. On the other hand, eating at a restaurant is still regarded as a special occasion or treat for most of the population.

Fish and chips, the staple take-away meal in New Zealand, has been popular for decades. Since the 1970s, a larger fast food culture has developed, similar to that in the United States. Many American fast-food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants (such as Burger Fuel and Hell Pizza) have arisen. The meat pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, sold in dairies, bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, and school canteens. Pies are usually made with beef mince or steak, lamb, chicken, veggies, or pork; sweet pies are less common. A fast-food chain based on pies, Georgie Pie, was founded in 1977; however, it ran into financial trouble and went out of business in 1998, with McDonald&#x27;s New Zealand buying its assets. (The chain was revived in a limited form between 2013 and 2020, with pies being sold through McDonald&#x27;s restaurants.)

In malls, food courts have become popular, with several in Auckland alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering Asian cuisines including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian, Japanese and Chinese, as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.

<text>Postal is a 1997 isometric top-down shooter video game developed by Running with Scissors and published by Ripcord Games. Players assume the role of the Postal Dude, a man who commits mass murder throughout the fictional town of Paradise, Arizona to cure what he believes to be a &quot;hate plague&quot; released by the United States Air Force.

A March 2001 re-release of the game, called &quot;Postal Plus&quot;, included a &quot;Special Delivery&quot; add-on. A sequel to the game, &quot;Postal 2&quot;, was released in 2003. Two additional sequels, &quot;Postal III&quot; and &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;, were released in 2011 and 2022, respectively. German film director Uwe Boll bought the movie rights for the series and produced a film of the same name. A remake of the game, &quot;Postal Redux&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows on May 20, 2016, and was later released for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch digital stores. At the end of 2016, the game&#x27;s source code was released under the GNU GPL-2.0-only. At the end of 2019, Running with Scissors released the game as freeware.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Postal&quot; is a shooter with isometric projection. Gameplay and interface are similar to first-person shooters of the time, but not on all counts:

*Movement is always relative to the orientation of the player character (named &quot;The Postal Dude&quot;). The player, therefore, must always be aware of the direction the character is facing, which can be difficult to some players on the isometric maps.
*There are eight weapon slots, each with a fixed amount of maximum ammo. The default weapon is a weak machine gun with unlimited ammo. Although it serves no practical purpose, the player can conceal their weapons by pressing the tilde key.

== Plot ==
A man referred to simply as the &quot;Postal Dude&quot; has been evicted from his home. He believes the United States Air Force is releasing an airborne agent upon his town of Paradise and that he is the only individual unaffected by the ensuing &quot;hate plague&quot;. He fights his way from his house to an Air Force Base through various locations, including a ghetto, train station, trailer park, truck stop, and an ostrich farm. During the course of the gameplay, a voice in the protagonist&#x27;s head (voiced by Rick Hunter) can be heard taunting his victims through cryptic absurdity, often through consecutive kills or when switching through the player&#x27;s arsenal.

After raiding the Air Force Base, he is shown attempting to massacre an elementary school. Despite his best efforts, his weapons have no effect on the children. Suffering a mental breakdown amidst innocent laughter, he finds himself restrained in a mental asylum as hellish images cover the screen: A body bound to chains in a corridor, the protagonist in a straitjacket curled in the fetal position; a close-up of his face, covered in bindings; and the door to his cell numbered 593. 

A disembodied voice, possibly a psychologist, gives a report on the protagonist&#x27;s mental state. He suggests that the stress of urban life may have been the root cause of his rampage, prompting him to &quot;go postal&quot;. The lack of any mentions of military interference with the civilian population implies that the Postal Dude&#x27;s murders were the result of his own paranoid delusions. Amid distorted audio, the psychologist gives a final remark: &quot;We may never know exactly what set him off, but rest assured we will have plenty of time to study him&quot;. Upon completion of the credits, manic cackling can be heard as the screen fades to black.

Due to the controversy surrounding the game&#x27;s release, along with numerous American school shootings in the years following, the ending was changed in &quot;Postal Redux&quot;. The developers stated that they changed the ending because school shootings had lost the shock value they had when the original &quot;Postal&quot; released. Replacing the elementary school vision is the player witnessing the burial of an unknown person in a decaying field, widely believed to be his own funeral. Completion of the game on the hardest difficulty features the inclusion of an unknown male and female mourning over the grave as it descends. Both outcomes prompt a similar mental breakdown and an identical asylum cutscene, though consisting of animated shots over the original release&#x27;s still image artwork.

== History ==
=== Development ===
Development of &quot;Postal&quot; began in March 1996. The developers at Riedel Software Productions (RSP), bored of developing child-friendly games, established the Running with Scissors (RWS) brand label to develop mature games they would want to play themselves. &quot;Postal&quot;, the first project under the new label, was inspired by &quot;&quot;, which was playable in the RSP offices. &quot;The Last Nail&quot; and &quot;The Postman Always Shoots Twice&quot;, a reference to the 1946 film &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, were titles also considered for the game.

The player character, a nameless man, was intentionally left without a backstory and obscured in shadows and filters in artwork to allow players to impose their own views onto him. The character&#x27;s &quot;Postal Dude&quot; moniker was coined by RWS CEO Vince Desi in an early interview about the game. The Postal Dude&#x27;s jacket was originally black, but RWS discovered during playtesting that the Dude was difficult to track onscreen in the darkly-lit levels and among other characters; his jacket was changed to red for the final game to compensate, which the team disliked. The Postal Dude&#x27;s pain sounds were voiced by Desi, while the comedic &quot;demon&quot; voice heard from the Dude&#x27;s mind was voiced by radio personality Rick Hunter.

&quot;Postal&quot; uses RSPiX, a cross-platform game engine developed internally at RSP that was previously used for the company&#x27;s child-friendly products, including &quot;Wishbone Activity Zone&quot; and &quot;Muppets Inside&quot;.

===Releases ===
&quot;Postal: Special Delivery&quot;, an expansion to the original &quot;Postal&quot;, was released on August 28, 1998 and featured four new levels and various new characters and voices. One level, in particular, was set in a parody of Wal-Mart and began with the Dude&#x27;s demon chastising the store for not selling &quot;Postal&quot;, which foreshadows the off-kilter humor seen in &quot;Postal 2&quot;.

In 2000 a Japanese version of &quot;Postal&quot; called &quot;Super Postal&quot; was released featuring Japanese voices and two exclusive levels, &quot;Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Osaka&quot;. These levels remained exclusive to &quot;Super Postal&quot; until the release of &quot;Postal Redux&quot; in 2016.

A March 2001 re-release of the game, called Postal Plus, included the &quot;Special Delivery&quot; add-on. It was ported to Linux by Loki Entertainment in the same year.

In 2002, &quot;Postal Plus&quot; (known as &quot;Postal: Classic and Uncut&quot; in Europe) bundled &quot;Postal&quot; and the &quot;Special Delivery&quot; expansion, with retail copies also including a demo for &quot;Postal 2&quot;.

&quot;Postal Plus&quot; was released on the digital distributor GOG.com in 2009 and a few years later on Steam. In 2013, it was updated with support for widescreen resolutions and modern hardware. The multiplayer component and level editor were removed, however. In 2015, it was updated with full Xbox 360 controller support. The &quot;Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Osaka&quot; levels, originally exclusive to &quot;Super Postal&quot;, were also added to both versions.

In 2015, the developers announced that they will release the source code of the game &quot;if someone promises to port it to the Dreamcast&quot;. In June 2016 the developers gave the source code to a community developer who ported the game to Linux for the OpenPandora handheld. On December 28, 2016, the source code was released on Bitbucket under the GNU GPL-2.0-only.

On February 14, 2022, independent publisher Wave Game Studios announced a port of the game to the Sega Dreamcast was to be released on June 2, officially licensed by Running with Scissors.

== Reception ==
NPD Techworld, a firm that tracked sales in the United States, reported 49,036 units sold of &quot;Postal&quot; by December 2002.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;Postal&quot; is a title that breaks absolutely no new ground, but its tongue-in-cheek shooting action comes together to form a well-above-average shooter that adds to the genre.&quot;

&quot;Postal&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a Metacritic score of 56/100. GameSpot&#x27;s Mark East gave the game a 6.6/10 score and commented: &quot;The lack of longevity in the single-player mode and the simplistic multiplayer options make Postal a moderately fun ride, at best.&quot; On regards to The Postal Dude&#x27;s aggressive personality East comments on the Postal Dude&#x27;s phrases from his diary, which indicate &quot;something&#x27;s not quite right in Postal Dude&#x27;s noggin&quot;. 

In a retrospective, GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson gave the game 7/10, commenting that &quot;there is no denying that &quot;Postal&quot; has some faults even when compared to some of the other games that were released around the same time as it, and time has definitely not been very kind to the title itself. But the concepts that the game explores, the ideas being expressed, and much of their actual implementations are just so interesting and compelling that one can still actually look past many of these faults and see the hidden gem that lies underneath.&quot;

The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; #30 (March/April 1998) stated that &quot;Many people have thought the premise for the game is sick. Well, it is. But, that&#x27;s what makes it fun. There&#x27;s no quest for secret, lost treasure. There&#x27;s no time-clock ticking away as you try desperately to save the world. There&#x27;s no alien spaceships or fantastical powers. There&#x27;s just good old fashioned, psychotic violence - something that our mass media entertainment powers have been bringing us on prime time for years.&quot;

==Sequels ==
A sequel to the game, &quot;Postal 2&quot;, was released in 2003. Director Uwe Boll bought the movie rights for the series and produced a film of the same name. Two additional sequels, &quot;Postal III&quot; and &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;, were released in 2011 and 2022, respectively.

== &quot;Postal Redux&quot; ==
Running with Scissors developed a remake of &quot;Postal&quot;, titled &quot;Postal Redux&quot;, using Unreal Engine 4. The project was announced as &quot;Postal: Redux&quot; in November 2014, then targeting a 2015 release for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. In addition to these platforms, Running with Scissors announced &quot;Postal Redux&quot; as coming to PlayStation 4 in February 2016. The Microsoft Windows version was released on May 20, 2016, while Linux, macOS, and PlayStation 4 versions were scheduled for a later release. The PlayStation 4 version was canceled by June 2017, with Jaret Schachter of Running with Scissors blaming a lack of sales of the PC version. MD Games ported &quot;Postal Redux&quot; to the Nintendo Switch, releasing it via the Nintendo eShop on October 16, 2020. The PlayStation 4 version was later uncancelled and released on March 5, 2021.

<text>The Tasman River is an alpine braided river flowing through Canterbury, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island.

The river&#x27;s headwaters are in Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, where it is the outflow of the proglacial Tasman Lake. It is also fed by the glacial waters of the tributary Murchison River, from Murchison Glacier, and the short Hooker River, an outflow of the proglacial lakes of the Hooker and Mueller glaciers.

The Tasman River flows south for through the wide flat-bottomed Tasman Valley in the Southern Alps and into the northern end of the glacial Lake Pukaki, this forming part of the ultimate headwaters of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme.

In 2019, a report by the Department of Conservation was released giving the results of a pilot study on the invertebrate biodiversity present in the Tasman River flood plain.

<text>A rissole (from Latin , meaning &quot;reddish&quot;, via French , meaning &quot;to redden&quot;) is &quot;a ball or flattened cake of chopped meat, fish, or vegetables mixed with herbs or spices, then coated in breadcrumbs and fried.&quot;

==Variations==

===Europe===

====France====

In France, rissoles can be served as a dessert cooked in the Savoy region. They are made of pears in batter and are baked, not fried.

In the north of France, are made with meat or fish and can be baked or fried. 

Different versions exist in Auvergne or in the east of France, with different kind of meat or potatoes and cheeses.

The dough used is generally puff pastry or a kind of shortcrust pastry made with less butter. They can be baked or fried. Some versions made with shortcrust pastry are breaded before frying.

====Great Britain====

In the 19th century, Mrs Beeton said French rissoles were &quot;Pastry, made of light puff-paste, and cut into various forms, and fried. They may be filled with fish, meat, or sweets.&quot; However her recipes for everyday British meals described rissoles which contained breadcrumbs but were not coated with anything, just fried (see illustration). She gave recipes for beef, veal and potato rissoles.

In Great Britain during and after World War II, rissoles were typically an economy measure, made from cooked meat remaining from the Sunday roast dinner. They are not pastry-covered. Rissoles are sold in chip shops in south Wales, north-east England, and Yorkshire, served with chips. These rissoles are meat (typically beef), or fish in Yorkshire, mashed up with potato, herbs, and sometimes onion. They are coated in breadcrumbs or less frequently battered and deep-fried.

====Ireland====
Fried rissoles are common in Ireland, especially in the county of Wexford, where boiled potatoes are mashed, mixed with herbs and spices, battered or breadcrumbed, and served with chips, chicken or battered sausages.

====Poland====
In Poland, rissoles are known as sznycle (singular &quot;sznycel&quot;) and are very common in canteens, especially in schools. Eaten hot as the main part of the main course, sznycle are usually served with boiled potatoes (sometimes mashed) and vegetables. The stuffing is always minced meat. Other variations use chicken or a combination of cheese and ham as a filling. In some regions where the name denotes a Wiener Schnitzel, the term kotlet siekany (literally: &quot;chopped cutlet&quot;) is used instead.

====Portugal====

In Portugal, rissoles are known as &quot;rissóis&quot; (singular &quot;rissol&quot;) and are a very popular snack that can be found in many cafes, barbecues, house parties, receptions, birthday and baptism parties. Rissóis are a breaded pastry shaped like a half-moon, the classic version is filled with shrimp but they can also be filled with meat in béchamel sauce and then deep fried. The most common filling is shrimp (meat is also a choice in small parts of the country, but not very popular) (from pork, including piglet meat, or beef), although hake, tuna, octopus, vegetables, cod, duck, cockle and spinach are sometimes used too. Other and less common variations use chicken or a combination of cheese, normally slices of queijo Flamengo (Flemish cheese) and cubes or slices of pork ham as a filling. Sometimes lobster is also used. Rissóis are usually eaten cold, as a snack or as an appetizer, but can also be a main course, usually served with salad or rice, the rice could be peas rice, tomato rice, carrot rice, beans rice or greens rice.

===South America===
In Brazil, they are often filled with heart of palm, cheese, ham, ground meat, chicken or shrimp. The term may refer to an Empanada, or Papa rellena which means &#x27;filled&#x27;.

===Australia and New Zealand===
This form of rissole is very similar to a hamburger patty and is made from minced meat without a pastry covering, resembling an irregular meatball, often covered in a crumb coating similar to that on a schnitzel. An Australian and New Zealand rissole usually contains more ingredients than a hamburger, almost always using breadcrumbs but many Australians and New Zealanders have their own family recipe which may also include onion, finely grated herbs and vegetables, sauces, salt, and spices. 

Rissoles are usually made from beef, chicken or lamb. Basing the rissoles on ingredients such as tuna, and pumpkin is also possible. They are cooked in a pan or on a barbecue, and are usually eaten hot as part of a meal. Australian rissoles are not usually eaten hot between bread with salad or cheese. If they are they will usually be called hamburger patties (despite differences between the two types of patty); however, cold rissoles are frequently eaten as a sandwich filling later.

The Australian rissole became popular during both World Wars as a means of stretching meat rationing set by the Australian government. Rissoles were made by butchers and housewives to use offcuts of meat, then finely minced with the adding of leftover bread crumbs, abundant flour, eggs, vegetables and herbs to improve the flavour. The Australian rissole has evolved over the past 100 years with some Australian families having special recipes and secret ingredients including beer, Vegemite, peanut butter, cornflakes, carrot, chilli and spices.

===Indonesia===

Rissole is a snack food in Indonesia, where they are called risoles (pronounced &#x27;riss-ol-less&#x27;) or just &quot;risol&quot;. The skin is made from batter in the same fashion as flat crepes. They are commonly filled with bechamel, chicken, egg, and diced vegetables - including carrot, celery, common beans and potato. The filling is wrapped inside the skin, then the package is rolled upon breadcrumbs and fried in ample amounts of hot cooking oil. It is eaten with bird&#x27;s eye chili, chilli sauce, tomato sauce, mayonnaise or mustard.

<doc id="1148067" wikidata="Q3661864" url="?curid=1148067" title="Schoolies week">
<text>Schoolies or schoolies week (also known as leavers&#x27; or leavers&#x27; week in Western Australia and coasties in the Australian Capital Territory) refers to the Australian tradition of high-school graduates (also known as &quot;schoolies&quot; or &quot;leavers&quot;) having week-long holidays following the end of their final exams in late November and early December.

&quot;Toolies&quot; refers to older revellers who participate in Schoolies week but graduated in an earlier year. &quot;Foolies&quot; refers to younger adolescents, who participate in Schoolies week but have not yet graduated from high school. Schoolies week is seen as a final party with schoolmates before they head their separate ways.

==History==
There is a history of school leavers following their final exams with a holiday on the Gold Coast in Queensland from at least the 1970s. Over time, it acquired the name &quot;Schoolies Week&quot; and events specifically for schoolies week began to be organised. It is claimed the first organised event was in 1976 at Lennon&#x27;s Broadbeach International Hotel. From then on the Gold Coast attracted schoolies from all over Australia for celebrations. Since then, the tradition has spread, and Australian high-school graduates celebrate their graduation with a week-long party at many popular tourist destinations around the country.

Schoolies week is considered by many teenagers in Australia as a cultural rite of passage. Schoolies week is seen as a transitional period from youth to adulthood, marking a change of state from the imposition of school discipline to the chosen freedom to have a body which is out of control. According to the Official National Schoolies Week Website, &quot;The most-enduring Schoolies-week tradition is the first run down the beach and dive into the ocean after school is finished forever. That plunge of freedom is the essence of freedom which Schoolies symbolises.&quot;

==Locations==
The Gold Coast, Queensland, particularly Surfers Paradise, maintains its status as the largest single venue for this revelry, attracting tens of thousands of schoolies, mostly from Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Gold Coast is viewed as a liminal space, somewhere to get away, a city of theme parks and leisure by the sea where transitions are possible. Research carried out in 2003 found schoolies boosted the Gold Coast economy by $59 million. In 2011, up to 40,000 students were expected to visit the Gold Coast. Around 16,000 schoolies visited the Gold Coast in 2021.

Schoolies are also present on the Sunshine Coast; this is an alternative for the graduates who fear the negative media attention attracted on the Gold Coast. According to the Sunshine Coast Region council the Sunshine Coast had about 500 schoolies visit in 2009. The local council on the Sunshine Coast stopped providing events for schoolies in 2007.

Schoolies have similar traditions at Magnetic Island off Townsville, Airlie Beach in the Whitsundays and Port Macquarie. Byron Bay and Surfers Paradise are particularly popular amongst private school graduates. For South Australia, Victor Harbor is the location of choice, while in Victoria the Surf Coast is popular, mainly consisting of Lorne and Torquay, however Phillip Island is also quite popular for students living in the east and south of Victoria. At Victor Harbor in 2011, approximately 15,000 students were expected to celebrate. In Western Australia, Rottnest Island off Perth and the South West towns of Dunsborough and Busselton are popular destinations. Also, Western Australians often go to Bali, as it is a spot for parties, late nights, and cheap shopping. In Tasmania there is not an established &quot;Schoolies&quot; location or tradition as such. Internationally, popular schoolies destinations include Bali, Fiji and Vanuatu. In Fiji, whole islands have been dedicated to schoolie celebrations.

===Official destinations===
According to Schoolies.com, there are 11 official destinations as of 2024. Of the 10 Australian destinations, three are in Queensland (Airlie Beach, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast (Coolum, Mooloolaba and Noosa Heads)), three are in Victoria (Lorne, Phillip Island and Rye), one is in New South Wales (Byron Bay) and one is in Western Australia (Dunsborough). Additionally, the official list also includes three international destinations: Fiji, Vanuatu and the island of Bali in Indonesia.

==Official Schoolies events==

Official Schoolies events are drug-free and alcohol-free events held at many Schoolies destinations. They include concerts, dances and parties. For all official events, attendees are required to be a registered schoolie and present a schoolie ID on entry. This schoolie ID, which at some locations includes a photo, is given to each schoolie upon registering, which requires the presentation of a current school ID and incurs a small fee. At many destinations, the official events are held in fenced-off areas or in nightclubs to prevent the infiltration of &quot;toolies&quot; and to maintain crowd control. Some events are free, while others (often those held at nightclubs) incur an entry fee.

==Toolies and foolies==
Popular schoolies&#x27; (or leavers&#x27;) venues are often attended by people well past school age, labelled by the media as &quot;toolies&quot; or &quot;droolies&quot;. Toolies are associated with the targeting of drunk teenagers for sex, and are also frequently involved in disturbances taking place during the celebrations. Because of this, toolies are a major topic of media scrutiny during Schoolies week. The term also includes early school leavers who are in apprenticeship training but join in the schoolies celebrations.

Another group that have some presence at Schoolies week celebrations are those known as &quot;foolies&quot; or &quot;pre-schoolies&quot;. These are adolescents who have not yet left school but still partake in activities during Schoolies week. Many organised events during Schoolies week, such as concerts, only admit those who are school leavers. On the Gold Coast in particular, Schoolies are often given wristbands as a form of identification.

== Criticism ==
Since the event began to attract large enough numbers to warrant annual media attention, Schoolies week has become a familiar concept nationwide. The media have represented the event as a period of lawlessness, loutish behaviour and unruliness. Some local residents and media have criticised the event due to binge drinking and sexual promiscuity. Police attention is regularly required where the collective behaviour of schoolies at some locations gets out of hand, such as at Rottnest Island in 1986. In efforts to reduce such acts, the week-long event on Rottnest Island in Western Australia has, as of 2006, been reduced to three days, which itself has resulted in a fair amount of criticism from young members of the public.

In recent years, violence (notably sexual violence) has become an increased threat to the safety of attendees. Fights have broken out between schoolies from one area and another and predictable media coverage of antics, accidents, and attacks has followed. The Queensland Government has been criticised for their efforts to stage-manage the event and limit celebrations.

2009 saw one of the most troublesome Gold Coast Schoolies celebrations in history, where in one night, police arrested 30 schoolies, and the number of arrests for the entire week doubled compared to the previous year. Superintendent Jim Keogh said that during eight days of 2009 schoolies celebrations, 217 schoolies had been arrested on 244 charges, compared with 94 schoolies arrested for the same period in 2006. Charges were laid against schoolies for serious assault, drunk and disorderly conduct, drug possession and obstructing police. The incidents prompted talks of banning Schoolies week. This has led schoolies to look at safer alternatives to ensure their wellbeing.

== Problems and risks ==
Schoolies week celebrations can involve large volumes of alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco, cannabis and ecstasy. Confrontations between participants can occur resulting in violent assaults. Other problems and risk associated with schoolies week include sexual health and sexual assault. In 2010, the Queensland Police made 145 arrests of school leavers on the Gold Coast, down from the 220 arrests made in 2009.

===Alcohol and other drugs===
Widely considered a week long alcohol binge, schoolies week is most criticised for excessive drinking and problems that flow from this. A 2010 study found that almost two-thirds of schoolies will consume more than ten drinks per night. The survey also revealed that most of the teenagers surveyed rated the experience negatively afterwards.

More recently laws have been changed at a Federal level increasing the tax on pre-mixed spirits, and at a state level in Queensland to focus on parents supplying alcohol to their children in an irresponsible way. Drink spiking has also been a significant problem.

The availability of drugs at Schoolies week has also been a problem. In 2011, 25% of male schoolies and 14% of females reported being stoned most or every day or night of Schoolies week.

=== Sex ===
Sexual health has been made a focus since opportunities for casual sex at schoolies week can lead to unprotected sex and the propagation of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). There are also concerns about sexual activity in public places such as beaches. Increases in sexual assaults during schoolies week destinations has also been a problem. A 2010 study found that one-third of males were expecting to have sex with multiple partners.

===Violence===
Schoolies has been long known for its violence, and media reporting has often focused on schoolies violence. In 1996, the Gold Coast City Council began to increase regulation of events and spaces.

One of the most violent Schoolies was in 2002 at the Gold Coast. Police were under-resourced, as several violent clashes occurred involving groups of people every night that week. In subsequent years with police numbers significantly increased and innovative approaches developed, the violence has continued, but police have rapidly engaged and resolved violence. When the Queensland Government took over the management of Schoolies at the Gold Coast in 2003 from the Gold Coast City Council, after the most violent Schoolies week in 2002, their primary concern was public perceptions of Schoolies week.

Schoolies destinations have been more heavily policed since, and some destinations have engaged private security guards to assist. The most significant statistic regarding violence at schoolies over the past few decades has placed the blame more so in the hands of &#x27;toolies&#x27; than &#x27;schoolies&#x27; themselves. Damage to hotel rooms has occurred, as well as vandalism to other private and public property.

=== Injuries and death ===
In 2002, the Queensland Government established a triage to treat and assess injuries and implement first aid. There have been a number of schoolies-related deaths and many violent altercations between youths. In one case death resulting from balcony fall in 2010 which has been claimed to be from planking. Climbing between apartment balconies is problematic. The offence can lead to arrest and is punishable by a fine of up to $2,875 and one year imprisonment.

==Red Frogs network==
The event is supported by an all-volunteer group of Christians who are recruited into the Red Frogs network. Around 1,500 volunteers serve in 17 locations across Australia. The group aims to provide direct support to partying school-leavers through a positive presence. This might involve walking them home, cleaning or cooking for them. The network began at the Gold Coast in 1997.

==Popular culture==
*&quot;Blurred&quot; is an Australian play about school leavers travelling to schoolies week.
*&quot;Blurred&quot; is a 2002 Australian film based on the play.
*Extensive footage of schoolies and schoolies week was featured in &quot;Fat Pizza Uncensored&quot;, a DVD collection of extras sold with some copies of the DVD for &quot;Fat Pizza: The Movie&quot;.
*The band TISM recorded a song titled &quot;Schoolies Week,&quot; which parodies schoolies week, describing it as having the same properties that would be found in hell.

<text>WNYW (channel 5) is a television station in New York City, serving as the flagship of the Fox network. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s Fox Television Stations division alongside Secaucus, New Jersey–licensed MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR-TV (channel 9). The two stations share studios at the Fox Television Center on East 67th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lenox Hill neighborhood; WNYW&#x27;s transmitter is located at One World Trade Center.

==History==
===DuMont origins (1944–1956)===
The station traces its history to 1938, when television set and equipment manufacturer Allen B. DuMont founded experimental station W2XVT in Passaic, New Jersey. That station&#x27;s call sign was changed to W2XWV when it moved to Manhattan in 1940. On May 2, 1944, the station received its commercial license, the third in New York City and fifth overall in the United States. It began broadcasting on VHF channel 4 as WABD with its call sign made up of DuMont&#x27;s initials. It was one of the few television stations that continued to broadcast during World War II, making it the fifth-oldest continuously broadcasting commercial station in the United States (after WNBT/WRCA/WNBC, WCBW/WCBS-TV, WPTZ/WRCV/KYW, and WRGB). The station originally had its studios in the DuMont Building at 515 Madison Avenue, with its transmitter tower atop the same building. (The original tower, long abandoned by the station, still remains.) On December 17, 1945, WABD moved to channel 5. WNBT (now WNBC) took over channel 4 the following spring, moving from channel 1, which the FCC was de-allocating from the VHF TV broadcast band. The series &quot;Here&#x27;s How&quot; first aired on WABD in 1946.
Soon after channel 5 received its commercial license, DuMont Laboratories began a series of experimental coaxial cable hookups between WABD and W3XWT (now WTTG), a DuMont-owned experimental station in Washington, D.C. These hookups were the beginning of the DuMont Television Network, the world&#x27;s first licensed commercial television network. (However, NBC was feeding a few programs and special events from its New York station WNBT to outlets in Philadelphia and Schenectady as early as 1940.) DuMont began regular network service in 1946 with WABD as the flagship station. On June 14, 1954, WABD and DuMont moved into the $5 million DuMont Tele-Centre at 205 East 67th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lenox Hill neighborhood, inside the shell of the space formerly occupied by Jacob Ruppert&#x27;s Central Opera House. Channel 5 is still headquartered in the same building, which was later renamed the Metromedia TeleCenter, and is now known as the Fox Television Center.

By February 1955, DuMont realized it could not continue in network television. In most cities around the U.S., NBC and CBS had secured affiliations with the top TV stations, making it difficult for DuMont shows to develop an audience and attract advertising dollars. DuMont decided to shut down the network&#x27;s operations and run WABD and Washington station WTTG as independent stations. DuMont had previously sold WDTV in Pittsburgh to the locally based Westinghouse Electric Corporation, arguably hastening DuMont&#x27;s demise. WABD thus became the New York market&#x27;s fourth independent station, alongside WOR-TV (channel 9), WPIX (channel 11) and Newark-licensed WATV (channel 13).

After DuMont wound down network operations in August 1955, DuMont Laboratories spun off WABD and WTTG into a new firm, the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation. Channel 5 gained a sister station in 1957, when DuMont purchased WNEW (1130 AM, now WBBR) in April of that year. The deal also included a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit for an FM radio station, which went on the air as 102.7 WNEW-FM when it began operations in August 1958.

===The Metromedia era (1957–1986)===
In May 1958, DuMont Broadcasting changed its name to the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation to distinguish itself from its former corporate parent. Four months later, on September 7, 1958, WABD&#x27;s call letters were changed to WNEW-TV to match its radio sisters. The final major corporate transaction involving the station during 1958 occurred in December. Washington-based investor John Kluge acquired Paramount Pictures&#x27; controlling interest in Metropolitan Broadcasting and appointed himself as the company&#x27;s chairman. Metropolitan Broadcasting began expanding its holdings across the United States, and changed its corporate name to Metromedia in 1961. However, the Metropolitan Broadcasting name was retained for Metromedia&#x27;s TV and radio station properties until 1967.
In the early 1960s, WNEW-TV was a leader in producing local children&#x27;s shows. They included &quot;Romper Room&quot; (until 1966, when it moved to WOR-TV), &quot;The Sandy Becker Show&quot; and &quot;The Sonny Fox Show&quot;, which was later known as &quot;Wonderama&quot;. Bob McAllister took over hosting &quot;Wonderama&quot; in 1967 and by 1970 it was syndicated to the other Metromedia stations. WNEW-TV also originated &quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; in 1966, and broadcast the program annually until 1986 when it moved to future sister station WWOR-TV, where it aired through 2012. In the early 1960s, the educational series &quot;Columbia Lectures in International Studies&quot; was shown on early weekday mornings, before Sandy Becker, and was distributed to other Metromedia stations. The station also aired cultural programs such as &quot;Festival of the Performing Arts&quot;. However, the station&#x27;s prime time schedule during those years was dominated by reruns of recently concluded crime dramas such as &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, and the 1950s edition of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, bringing the station some criticism for overly violent programming. In the 1970s, and early 1980s, local programming also included a weekly public affairs show hosted by Gabe Pressman, the New York edition of &quot;PM Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Midday Live&quot;, a daily talk/information show hosted by Lee Leonard, and later by Bill Boggs. The station also carried movies, cartoons, off-network sitcoms, drama series and a prime time nightly newscast at 10 p.m.

By the 1970s, channel 5 was one of the strongest independent stations in the country. Despite WOR-TV&#x27;s and WPIX&#x27;s eventual status as national superstations, WNEW-TV was the highest-rated independent in New York. From the early 1970s to the late 1980s, channel 5 was available as a regional superstation in large portions of the Northeastern United States, including most of Upstate New York, and sections of eastern Pennsylvania and southern New England.

===The Fox era (1986–present)===

On May 4, 1985, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, which had recently bought a controlling interest in the 20th Century Fox film studio, announced its purchase of Metromedia&#x27;s six independent television stations, including WNEW-TV. In the interim between the announcement and the buyout, Metromedia references were largely phased out of channel 5&#x27;s branding. Upon taking control nearly one year later, on March 7, 1986, channel 5&#x27;s call sign was changed slightly to the present WNYW. The change was made due to an FCC rule in place (no longer in effect) that prohibited TV and radio stations with different ownership from sharing the same call sign. Along with the other former Metromedia independent stations, WNYW formed the cornerstone of the Fox Broadcasting Company when it launched on October 9, 1986.

WNYW&#x27;s schedule initially changed very little, as Fox aired programming only on late nights and weekends on two nights of the week in the network&#x27;s first few years. It was not until 1993 that Fox began broadcasting a full seven nights&#x27; worth of programming. Although it began taking on the look of a network-owned station in the fall of 1986, channel 5 continued to carry decades-old syndicated cartoons, sitcoms and films into the late 1980s. As a result, channel 5 was still considered by many to be an independent station.

Murdoch had one local obstacle to overcome before his purchase of channel 5 could become final. News Corporation had owned the &quot;New York Post&quot; since 1976 and the FCC&#x27;s media ownership rules barred common ownership of newspapers and broadcast licenses in the same media market. The FCC granted Murdoch a temporary waiver to keep the &quot;Post&quot; and WNYW to allow News Corporation to complete its purchase of the Metromedia television stations. News Corporation sold the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 1988, but bought the paper back five years later with a permanent waiver of the cross-ownership rules.

In late summer 1986, WNYW debuted the nightly newsmagazine &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, one of the first shows to be labeled as a &quot;tabloid television&quot; program. Originally a local program, it was first anchored by Maury Povich, formerly of Washington sister station WTTG. (He also briefly anchored WNYW&#x27;s evening newscasts.) Within a year of its launch, &quot;A Current Affair&quot; was syndicated to the other Fox-owned stations. In 1988, the series entered into national syndication, where it remained until the original incarnation of the program was cancelled in 1996. On August 1, 1988, the station dropped its weekday morning cartoons in favor of a local news and information program titled &quot;Good Day New York&quot;, which continues to this day.

Following the launch of the Fox network, WNYW lost much of its out-of-market superstation reach, as most markets in the Northeast had their own Fox affiliates. WNYW continued to be seen on cable in the Binghamton metropolitan area and the New York side of the Plattsburgh–Burlington market until the late 1990s, when WICZ-TV and WFFF-TV joined the network.

In 2001, Fox bought BHC Communications, a television station group owned by Chris-Craft Industries, which effectively created a duopoly between WNYW and its former rival, WWOR-TV. In autumn 2001, WNYW dropped Fox Kids&#x27; weekday block and moved it to WWOR-TV, where it ran for a few more months before Fox discontinued the network&#x27;s weekday children&#x27;s lineup at the end of that year. In 2004, Fox Television Stations announced that it would move WWOR&#x27;s operations from Secaucus to WNYW&#x27;s facility at the Fox Television Center in Manhattan. While some office functions were merged, plans for a full move to Manhattan were abandoned later that year due to pressure from New Jersey Congressman Steve Rothman (whose congressional district includes Secaucus) and Senator Frank Lautenberg on the grounds that any move to Manhattan would violate the conditions of WWOR&#x27;s broadcast license. The company also considered moving WNYW&#x27;s operations to Secaucus, but ultimately decided to remain in the Fox Television Center.

On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WNYW, eight other New York City television stations, and several radio stations, were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. The station relocated to an antenna located atop the Empire State Building, where its transmitter facilities had been located until they were moved to the World Trade Center in the 1970s. By the late 2010s, the transmitter returned to the newly built One World Trade Center.

In April 2006, WNYW became the first Fox-owned to launch a website on Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s &quot;MyFox&quot; platform, which featured expanded content, more videos and new community features such as blogs and photo galleries. The MyFox sites were later outsourced to WorldNow, and later Lakana beginning in 2015, after which the &quot;MyFox&quot; brand was discontinued.

On October 15, 2010, News Corporation pulled the signals of WNYW, WWOR, along with co-owned cable channels Fox Business Network, Fox Deportes, and National Geographic Wild from Cablevision systems in the New York television market area, due to a dispute between Fox and Cablevision. Cablevision claimed News Corporation had demanded $150 million a year to renew its carriage of 12 Fox-owned channels, including those removed due to the dispute. Cablevision offered to submit to binding arbitration on October 14, 2010. News Corporation rejected Cablevision&#x27;s proposal, stating that it would &quot;reward Cablevision for refusing to negotiate fairly&quot;. WWOR, WNYW and the three cable channels were restored on October 30, 2010, when Cablevision and News Corporation struck a new carriage deal.

After News Corporation split into two companies on June 28, 2013, spinning off its publishing assets (including the &quot;New York Post&quot;) into a new News Corp, WNYW became part of 21st Century Fox. On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC owned-and-operated station WABC-TV (channel 7), announced its intent to buy the assets of 21st Century Fox for $66.1 billion, pending regulatory approval. The sale did not include the Fox network, MyNetworkTV, WNYW, WWOR, the Fox Television Stations unit or any other broadcast assets, since that would be illegal under FCC rules prohibiting a merger between any of the four major networks. Ownership was transferred to a new company called Fox Corporation, a split officially completed on March 18, 2019.

In the fall of 2018, after WWOR&#x27;s license was renewed, and several months after the repeal of the FCC&#x27;s main studio rule (which required WWOR to operate from New Jersey as a license condition), Fox Television Stations sold its former Secaucus studios to Hartz Mountain Industries for $4.05 million, and consolidated WWOR&#x27;s operations with WNYW at the Fox Television Center.

==Programming==
===Locally-produced programming===
In 1966, WNEW produced the first edition of &quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;, initially as a charity event seen exclusively on WNEW. In 1968, the telethon expanded to a network of six stations in the Northeastern United States, which was dubbed the &quot;Love Network&quot;, with WNEW serving as flagship. The station produced local segments for the program, which were broadcast on the Sunday night before through the evening of Labor Day, from 1966 until 1986. The telethon moved to future sister station WWOR-TV in 1987 where it aired until 2012 when it became a reduced-length special known as the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot;. The telethon moved to ABC as a national broadcast in 2013 until its final telecast in 2014.

In 1980, the station began producing one minute vignettes entitled &quot;Big Apple Minute&quot; featuring the station&#x27;s on-air team touring New York City-area attractions. These lasted until 1987, following the station&#x27;s acquisition by Fox and the call letter change in 1986. The station also produced the New York City version of &quot;PM Magazine&quot; from 1980 until 1988 when it was transferred to WWOR where it was called &quot;PM&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; (a name generally reserved for Group W-owned stations) and aired until its cancellation in 1989.

The station also broadcast the Puerto Rican Day Parade from 2006 until 2015.

Currently, the station produces several local programs. &quot;Chasing New Jersey&quot; is a daily program featuring segments and stories focusing on headlines and issues affecting the New Jersey area. The show is produced by Fairfax Productions and airs in the overnight slot after it airs on sister station WWOR-TV. &quot;Good Day Street Talk&quot; is a weekly community affairs program hosted by Antwan Lewis.

===Sports programming===

Through its network&#x27;s sporting division, WNYW has televised major sporting championships featuring New York teams in the past years. As part of the network&#x27;s coverage of the National Hockey League in 1995, the station televised games one and four of the Stanley Cup Finals when the New Jersey Devils won their first Stanley Cup.

From 1999 to 2001, WNYW held the broadcast rights to New York Yankees game telecasts, displacing longtime broadcaster WPIX. Under the initial deal, WNYW and actual rights holder the Madison Square Garden Network carried Yankees games until 2001. Broadcasts of the team&#x27;s games were moved to the new YES Network through a joint arrangement with WCBS-TV. This lasted until the 2004 season; WWOR-TV took over the broadcasts beginning in 2005. WNYW continues to show Yankees games through Fox&#x27;s national broadcast contract with Major League Baseball; through this package, the station aired the Yankees&#x27; World Series victories in 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2009 and their other appearances in 2001, 2003, and 2024. As of 2022, WNYW is the only broadcast station to carry Yankees games, as rights for games formerly shown by WPIX were sold to Amazon. It also airs any Mets games that are featured on Fox&#x27;s MLB coverage, in that capacity broadcasting the aforementioned 2000 World Series in which they lost to the cross-town Yankees, and 2015 World Series in which they lost out to the Kansas City Royals.

Since the network established its sports division in 1994, most sporting events carried on channel 5 have been provided through Fox Sports. At that time, the network acquired partial television rights to the and primary rights to the . As a result of this, the station became the unofficial &quot;home&quot; station of the New York Giants airing select telecasts. Among the notable Giants games aired on the station is the team&#x27;s victory in Super Bowl XLII, when the Giants ended their 17-year title drought by defeating the New England Patriots, who were 18–0 at the time and were one win away from the second perfect season in NFL history. In addition, beginning with the 2018 season, the station aired the team&#x27;s Thursday night games as part of its newly acquired &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; package that it shares with NFL Network (along with Thursday night Jets games) until the 2021 season. Currently, Giants games are rotated between WCBS-TV (through the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot;), WABC-TV (&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;), WPIX (&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (if WABC-TV is not airing them)), and WNBC (through &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;). The station also airs at least two games involving the Jets each year—usually whenever they play an NFC opponent at home. Since 2014, more Jets&#x27; games can be shown on WNYW as part of the NFL&#x27;s new &quot;cross-flex&quot; broadcast rules. WNYW also provided local coverage of Super Bowl XLVIII which was played at MetLife Stadium.

On March 12, 2024, it was announced that WNYW and WWOR would become the new broadcast partner for the New York Liberty.

===News operation===
WNYW broadcasts 53 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10 hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays). As is standard with Fox stations that carry early evening weekend newscasts, WNYW&#x27;s Saturday and Sunday 6 p.m. newscasts are subject to delay or preemption due to network sports coverage. WNYW and sister station WWOR-TV share resources with Philadelphia sister station WTXF-TV in areas of New Jersey in which the New York and Philadelphia markets overlap; the stations share reporters for stories occurring in New Jersey counties served by both markets.

In 1944, the first newscast for Channel 5 was &quot;Late Night News&quot;. In 1945, the news department of Channel 5 rebranded its newscast as &quot;TV5 Late Report&quot;, and rebranded it again as &quot;TV5 24 Hours&quot; from 1962 to March 10, 1967.

The station is home to one of America&#x27;s longest-running primetime local newscasts: WNYW (as WNEW-TV) first premiered its 10 p.m. newscast—the first primetime newscast in the New York market—on March 13, 1967. Each night, the newscast (originally known as &quot;The 10 O&#x27;Clock News&quot; until 2001 and currently in use since 2021) is preceded by the simple, but now well-known announcement: &quot;It&#x27;s 10 p.m., Do you know where your children are?&quot;, which was originally spoken by Mel Epstein, WNEW-TV&#x27;s director of on-air promotions, and later by staff announcer Tom Gregory
(this announcement continues to be shown before the newscast); other television stations in the country began using the tagline for their own 10 p.m. (or 11 pm) news (which may depend on the start of the local youth curfew in each market). Celebrities were often used to read the slogan in the 1980s, and for a time in the late 1970s, the station added a warmer announcement earlier in the day: &quot;It&#x27;s 6 p.m., have you hugged your child today?&quot; From 1975 to 1985, the 10 p.m. newscast notably featured nightly op-ed debates which pitted conservative Martin Abend against liberal Professor Sidney Offit.

In the early 1970s, the news department launched its 30-minute program &quot;Sports Extra&quot;, airing at 10:30 p.m. on Sundays; where it continues to air. The first time WNEW programmed news outside its established 10 p.m. slot was in 1985, when it premiered the short-lived &quot;First Edition News&quot;, a half-hour midday newscast anchored by Jim Ryan (formerly of WNBC) and Judy Licht, serving as a lead-in to &quot;Midday Live with Bill Boggs&quot;; not long after the program moved to noon with &quot;Midday&quot; at 12:30 pm.

After the buyout from Murdoch went through, the station began to intensify their news efforts. It first premiered a half-hour 7 p.m. newscast, simply known as &quot;Fox News at Seven&quot;, in 1988; the program was canceled in 1993. On August 1, 1988, WNYW became the first Fox station to run a weekday morning newscast with the debut of the two-hour &quot;Good Day New York&quot;; within five years of its launch, the program became the top-rated morning show in the New York City market. In 1991, a new and eventually very popular music package was composed for the show by Edd Kalehoff, a New York-based composer best known for composing the themes and music cues for game shows such as &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Since the Fox takeover, WNYW&#x27;s newscasts have become more tabloid in style and have been fodder for jokes, even to the point of being parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The consumer reporting segment &quot;The Problem Solvers&quot; has received the same treatment on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

WNYW was the first television station to cover the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center that occurred on September 11, 2001. The station interrupted a commercial break at 8:48 am. ET to deliver the first public report of the attacks on air by anchor Jim Ryan and reporter Dick Oliver. WNYW donated a digitized copy of this coverage to the Internet Archive in July 2012. In 2002, WNYW brought early evening newscasts back to the station with the launch of a 90-minute weekday news block from 5 p.m. to 6:30 pm. Longtime anchor John Roland, a 35-year veteran of channel 5, retired from the station on June 4, 2004; former NBC News correspondent Len Cannon, who joined WNYW as a reporter and anchor some time earlier, was initially named as Roland&#x27;s replacement. Several months later, veteran New York City anchorman Ernie Anastos (who at the time was anchoring at WCBS-TV) signed a multi-year contract with WNYW, displacing Cannon as lead anchor; Cannon asked for, and was granted, a release from his contract with the station shortly after Anastos&#x27;s contract deal was announced. Anastos joined WNYW in July 2005, and Cannon joined KHOU-TV in Houston as its lead anchor in the spring of 2006. On April 3, 2006, WNYW debuted a new set, theme music and graphics package, and introduced a new logo based on the on-air look first adopted by Tampa sister station WTVT that became standard for all of Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations.

On November 9, 2008, WNYW became the fifth New York City television station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On July 13, 2009, &quot;Good Day New York&quot; expanded with the addition of a fifth hour of the program from 9 a.m. to 10 am; the noon newscast was dropped in turn. In the fall of 2009, WNYW entered into a Local News Service agreement with NBC owned-and-operated station WNBC to share helicopter footage with that station; WNYW&#x27;s helicopter SkyFox HD was renamed &quot;Chopper 5&quot; on-air, though the SkyFox name was reinstated in 2010, while the name &quot;Chopper 4&quot; continued to be used by WNBC. The LNS agreement ended in 2012 when WNBC began operating its own helicopter; WNYW has since entered into a helicopter-sharing agreement with CBS-owned WCBS-TV.

During the 10 p.m. newscast on September 16, 2009, anchor Ernie Anastos cursed live on-air while engaging in banter with chief meteorologist Nick Gregory, saying &quot;I guess it takes a tough man to make a tender forecast&quot;, adding &quot;keep fucking that chicken&quot;; the incident gained some notoriety when it and other videos of the on-air gaffe appeared on YouTube, making Anastos and WNYW the subject of a joke on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; Anastos apologized for the incident on the following night&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast.

On June 5, 2014, WNYW relaunched its 6 p.m. newscast as a more topical, interactive program; on June 6, the station launched the entertainment, lifestyle and music program &quot;Friday Night Live&quot; (airing during the timeslot normally occupied by the second half-hour of the 10 p.m. newscast). This was followed by the June 7 debut of hourly news updates that air weekend mornings between 9 a.m. and noon (WNYW is the only news-producing English language network O&amp;O in the New York City market that does not carry a full-fledged local newscast on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings, and is one of two Fox owned-and-operated stations without a weekend morning newscast, alongside KTTV in Los Angeles).

As of January 2021, WNYW is the only news-producing station in the New York City market that continues to present field video in widescreen standard definition; all of the other stations broadcast all or most of their field video in high definition.

====Notable former on-air staff====
==In popular culture==
WNYW was portrayed in an episode of the Fox animated comedy &quot;Futurama&quot;, titled &quot;When Aliens Attack&quot;, in which the station was accidentally knocked off the air by Philip J. Fry in 1999. That resulted in angry Omicronians invading Earth in the year 3000 (having received the broadcast signal 1000 years later being 1000 light-years away) and demanding to see the end of an &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;-esque program called &quot;Single Female Lawyer&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WNYW discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, at 11:59 p.m. ET on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; the shutdown occurred during the closing credits of a syndicated rerun of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using virtual channel 5. It carried WWOR&#x27;s programming on digital subchannel 5.2 until 2009, when it changed the PSIP data to identify the virtual channel carrying WWOR&#x27;s programming to 9.2. As of 2019, a channel of WWOR&#x27;s programming is no longer multiplexed with WNYW.

<doc id="1148072" wikidata="Q707036" url="?curid=1148072" title="Bealey River">
<text>The Bealey River is a small river located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. It is a tributary of the Waimakariri River. Its valley forms the eastern approach to Arthur&#x27;s Pass. The river and the Bealey settlement are named for Samuel Bealey, a 19th-century Superintendent of Canterbury Province and pastoralist.

==Locomotive dumpsite==
In the first half of the 20th century, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) dumped a number of withdrawn locomotives and wagons in the river to stabilise its banks and prevent erosion, particularly near the railway bridge across the Bealey River. Some of these locomotives and wagons have been recovered by heritage groups with the aim of restoring them to operating condition, including WMR No. 9 (later NZR N 453) by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust in 2003. Most of the other locomotives and components have since been either buried or scrapped. The more substantially complete remains of ex-WMR No. 10 (later NZR N 454) are believed to be buried in the river bed near Cora Lynn, further up the river.

During the early 1920s, NZR used a former quarry near Cora Lynn station as an open-air workshop to strip locomotives of useful parts before they were dumped. This quarry was host to a number of locomotive parts including the frame of V 132, which had been retrofitted with Walschaerts valve gear in 1898 as an experiment by NZR. Shortly after this frame was salvaged in 1997–98, Tranz Rail and the Department of Conservation initiated a clean-up operation in the old quarry, burying many of the locomotive parts there into the access embankment.

Similarly, NZR used the Bealey River as a place to scrap old wooden passenger coaches in the 1950s and 1960s. These carriages would be brought from Addington Railway Workshops in Christchurch, shunted into the riverbed, and then burnt to recover their metal parts for scrap or as spares for other operating vehicles.

==History==
===Ancient and Medieval Period===
Berhampur, along with regions of southern Odisha, have been a core part of ancient Kalinga empire. Jaugada also known as &quot;Samapa&quot;, 35 km away from Berhampur on the banks of the Rushikulya, was an ancient fort and city existing from 3rd century BC to 7th century AD. Its existence before and after this time period cannot be ruled out. After Kalinga war, Samapa turned into a provincial headquarter of Maurya empire along with &quot;Dhauli&quot; as evident from the edicts found at both places. Specific history about the place and civilisation does not exist after the Maurya rule and the fort is now buried. As per Ain-i-Akbari, this region used to be called &quot;Kalinga Dandapat&quot; which was an administrative division of the Odishan empire under the Eastern Ganga dynasty and later the Gajapati dynasty.

Berhampur is also known as the Silk city for its famous Berhampur Patta (silk) Sarees. The chief of the Dera community, Kota Chandramani Kubera Senapati, led his community people to migrate to Mohuri (Berhampur) who settle down into their hereditary profession of weaving tussar silken products or &quot;Patta Matha&quot;. They migrated to the city from Rajahmundry (they were known as &quot;Devanga&quot;s there) sometime during 1662-1672 on the request of the then Raja Harihar Narayan Deo of Mohuri zamindari. The cult of &quot;Buddhi Thakurani Yatra&quot; also originated along with the emergence of weaver community in here. They started the &quot;Ghata Yatra&quot; (Pot Festival) for the purpose of highlighting the tradition of worshiping the Goddesses as well as to use it as a platform for sales promotion of their silken products.

=== Period of British Rule ===
The Ganjam Garhjat area was consisted of 22 zamindaris of various royal lineages. The French invaded Ganjam in 1759 (in the battle of Deccan) and quit in 1763. The British imposed their authority over southern Odisha in 1766 and placed the whole region under the Madras Presidency. The district headquarters of Ganjam district started functioning in 1768 from Potagarh. An epidemic broke out in 1815 and that forced the authorities to shift the headquarters to Berhampur including the civil and military personnels. Berhampur was the capital and residence of the Mohuri (Mahuri) zamindar. But the Ganjam collectorate could not continue for a long time and shifted to Chhatrapur in 1831 due to stiff resistance here. After the auction and abolishing the Ghumusar and Sorada zamindari in 1836, Britishers auctioned Mohuri zamindari in 1850 over non payment of tax dues and introduced Ryotwari system of tax collection which led to Raja Krushna Chandra Narendra Deo out of power. The then value of Mohuri, which was a leading zamindari, was valued at 50 lakh rupees but no Indian dared to come forward to bid for it. So, it was auctioned for only 100 rupees. Britishers were stationed at Bhapur area, at the centre of Berhampur. They built military lines, a military hospital, a magazine house and a parade ground for sepoys there. Subsequently, Berhampur was formed into a Taluk and was kept under a senior assistant collector. The present Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC) residence was his residence. In 1867, Berhampur was declared as a Municipality area and this being a part of Madras Presidency, it attracted further influx of settlers from south because of better engagement in business sectors. The bi-lingualism (Odia and Telugu) prevails since that time. The Brahmapur railway station started functioning by 1900. This had profound effects in the transport system and mobility of passengers. The population in 1901 was 25729 which increased to 62343 by 1951 as per census report. The colonial town generated a considerable amount of interest among Indian scholars who linked the important issues of modernity, national aspirations, notions of citizenship and the creation of new artistic sensibilities. The city is also known for its love for the theatre and cinema. The &quot;Ganjam Kala Parishad&quot; and &quot;Prakasam Hall&quot; are one of the oldest theatre halls in the country. The &quot;Sri Sitaram Vilas Talkies&quot; is the oldest movie hall in Odisha which was established in 1927 but closed down after the devastating 1999 Odisha cyclone.

=== Role in Orissa Province formation ===
Berhampur was where Odias assembled and started their agitations more than three decades prior to demanding introduction of Odia as a subject in the Madras University and recognition of Odia language in courts and government offices of Ganjam. This paved the path for the public grievances. In 1903 at the First Utkal Union Conference at Cuttack, Raghava Rao from Berhampur moved a resolution which called separation of the district of Ganjam, Ganjam Hill Tracts Agency and Vizagapatam Hill Tracts Agency from Madras Presidency. Subsequently, an annual conference of the Ganjam Jatiya Samiti (Ganjam National Conference) was held in 11 &amp; 12 April 1903 at Berhampur. It saw the participation of some leaders from Odisha like Madhusudan Das, Gopabandhu Das, Radhanath Ray, Nanda Kishore Bal and Fakir Mohan Senapati. After continuous efforts the undivided Sambalpur district was transferred to Orissa division from Central Provinces and Berar on 1 September 1905. Although the long standing claims of Odias of Ganjam was ignored. On 1912, Bihar and Orissa Province formed without Ganjam district and Vizagapatnam Agency. Although Telugus opposed the amalgamation of Berhampur, the leaders
of the Andhra Movement advocated that, provinces were to be created on a linguistic basis. Some Telugus like Dr. B.Pattabhisitarameya, a nationalist, proposed to include Odia regions of Ganjam and Vizagapatnam to merge with Orissa. N. Subha Rao, a
Telugu member of the Imperial Legislative Council pleaded for the same with some compensatory gain. Sri Rama Rayanger, a member of Council of Governor-General of India strongly supported the amalgamation. He presided over a meeting at Berhampur where both Odias and Telugus attended and he said that both groups suffered under the Madras government. From 1920 to 1936, the Odia Movement became more active and vigorous after British administration ignored the demands of the Odias in their Government of India Act 1919. Prominent leaders of Odisha repeatedly put the amalgamation question in the Provincial Legislative Councils, the Imperial Legislative Council and even in the British Parliament. Mahatma Gandhi when he visited Berhampur on 29 March 1921 appealed to the non-odias to yield to the demand of Odisha amalgamation. When he returned he wrote an article supporting the demands of Odias in &quot;Young India&quot;. In 1928 when the Simon Commission visited India, Krushna Chandra Gajapati, the Maharaja of Paralakhemundi Estate and Bhubaneswar Rath of Berhampur appeared before the commission at Madras and presented memorandum claiming merger. The commission recommended the merger on the basis of linguistic pattern and appoint a sub-committee, to conduct
detailed investigation. The report of the Simon Commission led to the summoning of the Round Table Conference in London in 1930. The Maharaja of Paralakhemundi, leading an Odia delegate to the conference circulated a pamphlet, &quot;The Oriyas, their need and reasons for separate state&quot;. The Government of India appointed a boundary commission for Orissa with S.P. O&#x27;Oonell as Chairman whose report was opposed by Odias as it only recommended the inclusion of the plains and the agency of Ganjam and excluded areas like Paralakhemundi, Manjusa, Tekali, Tarla etc. Odia speaking people in and around Berhampur town tried their best to justify the linguistic affinity and socio-cultural attachment with the Odias of Odisha and Odia speaking people outside Odisha. They argued how under non-odia census officers, the population of Odias decreased from census to census. People realised Berhampur could become a noble point in the growth of socio-political consciousness and that territorial dismemberment of Odia speaking areas was the reason for backwardness under British rule. On 25 March 1933, Sashibhusan Rath led an Odia delegation to the Collector of Ganjam. Similarly at many places in and around Berhampur protest meetings were organized demanding the merger of Paralakhemundi in Orissa. The Maharaja of Paralakhemundi again went to London to give evidence before the Joint Select Committee and after strenuous efforts he was able to include the Odia majority portion of Paralakhemundi Estate along with its town and Jeypore Estate in the new province of Orissa. In line with the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee, the Government of India Act of 1935 was passed by the British Parliament and the Orissa Province was formed in 1st April 1936.

<doc id="1148083" wikidata="Q854644" url="?curid=1148083" title="Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge">
<text>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (often shortened to Three Cheers or Revenge) is the second studio album by American rock band My Chemical Romance, released on June 8, 2004, by Reprise Records. With this album, the band produced a more polished sound than that of their 2002 debut &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first release to feature rhythm guitarist Frank Iero on all tracks, as well as the final release to feature drummer Matt Pelissier, who would later be replaced by Bob Bryar.

The album received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success for both the band and the Reprise label. The record produced three singles—&quot;I&#x27;m Not Okay (I Promise)&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost of You&quot;. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) less than a year after its release, and has sold over three million copies in the United States.

==Music and lyrical themes==
Musically, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; has been described as emo, alternative rock, pop punk, post-hardcore, punk rock, and pop rock. While &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot; was considered &quot;a particularly strident entry in that shifty genre of bands tortuously slamming together elements of emo, hardcore, and even metal&quot;, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; &quot;both showcased their songwriting skills and gave them much-deserved attention&quot;. Moving away from the &quot;screamo parts&quot; and &quot;the more complicated structures&quot; of their first record in favor of a sound that &quot;skirts the line between pop punk and edgy, theatrical, emo&quot; while being &quot;strongly influenced by hardcore punk&quot;, &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; has been variously compared to The Misfits, AFI, and Thursday.

Lead singer Gerard Way has referred to the first single &quot;I&#x27;m Not Okay (I Promise)&quot; as a &quot;self help pop song&quot; while also being called &quot;a surging piece of emo-pop with a hook as ridiculously catchy as it was ridiculous&quot; and a &quot;moving anthem for the young and depressed&quot; by AllMusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; respectively. This single went on to be nominated for the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; award for best single and reached number 86 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album opener &quot;Helena&quot; has been referred to as an &quot;album highlight and smash hit&quot;. Gerard has claimed that the song &quot;shaped what the album is about&quot; and &quot;revealed their dark side&quot; in comparison to the first single. Its lyrics mourn the loss of Gerard and Mikey&#x27;s grandmother, Elena Lee Rush, and was their first entry into the top 40.

===Album concept===

According to Way, the album can be understood as a &quot;pseudo-conceptual horror story&quot;, that details:

...the story of a man and a woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell only to realize by the devil telling him that she&#x27;s still alive. The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it, and so the devil hands him a gun. That was the idea behind the concept, the record ended up being much more about loss and real life than anything, so I would say it&#x27;s a good split.

==Reception==
Johnny Loftus of AllMusic wrote that &quot;with the aid of production major-leaguer Howard Benson, they&#x27;ve edited the slight rookie excesses of &quot;I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love&quot;, resulting in a rewarding, pretty damn relentless product.&quot; Andy Greenwald of &quot;Blender&quot; noted Way&#x27;s integration of elements of his life into the songs on the album and remarked that his &quot;gulping, gasping whine turns stompers like &#x27;I&#x27;m Not Okay (I Promise)&#x27; into after-school poetry&quot;. Ian Mathers of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; felt that the album contained &quot;twelve near-flawless songs and an interlude in thirty-nine minutes&quot; and that &quot;even when it lets up, [it] doesn&#x27;t let up&quot;, while Kirk Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;a hell of a good time.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; critic JR was more reserved in his praise, calling &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; &quot;a good album&quot; that nonetheless &quot;isn&#x27;t nearly as varied or daring as it could have been&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave it a &quot;dud&quot; rating.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
&quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood the Test of Time&quot;. The album was ranked at number 260 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)&quot; list. &quot;Rock Sound&quot; wrote that the album is &quot;an era-defining release&quot;, striking &quot;a nerve both musically and emotionally with millions around the world.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; the tenth greatest emo album out of 40, saying that &quot;&quot;Three Cheers&quot; wasn&#x27;t just a concept record, it was a concept sequel, expanding the small-screen story of 2002&#x27;s &quot;I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love&quot; into a big-budget production, complete with ruminations on life and death (&quot;Helena&quot;) biting kiss-offs (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Okay&quot;) and a series of dramatic music videos that made them MTV darlings.&quot;

&quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; has sold over three million copies to date in the United States and has been certified 3× platinum by the RIAA as of December 2017. By February 2006, the album had sold over 1,356,000 copies in the US and 3 million copies to date. It has also been certified triple platinum in Canada, platinum in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and Gold in Australia, Ireland, Chile, Mexico and Argentina.

<text>The Conway River is part of the traditional boundary between the Canterbury and Marlborough regions in the South Island of New Zealand.

It arises in the Amuri Range near Palmer Saddle and runs for south-east through the Hundalee Hills at the south end of the Seaward Kaikōura Mountains before turning north-east and reaching the Pacific Ocean south of Kaikōura. The Charwell River is a tributary. It was probably named after the River Conwy in North Wales, as this was the origin of Thomas Hanmer, an owner of Hawkeswood Station near this river during the 1850s.

<text>Theodore Francis Leo (born September 11, 1970) is an American singer and musician. He is the frontman and lead guitarist of the rock group Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, and in 2013, he and Aimee Mann formed the indie rock duo The Both.

== Early life ==
Born in South Bend, Indiana, Leo grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey, where his family was from and spent many formative years in the hardcore punk scene of New York City during the 1980s and early 1990s. He graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange in 1988 and the University of Notre Dame in the fall of 1993 with a degree in English.

== Career ==

Leo was a founding member of the New York punk band Citizens Arrest in 1989. In the 1990s, Leo played in bands that included Chisel, Puzzlehead, and the Sin-Eaters.

Ted Leo and the Pharmacists was formed in 1999 in Washington, D.C. The group recorded six studio albums between 1999 and 2010. Leo has also maintained a consistent presence as a solo performer since the 1990s.

In 2011, Leo joined TV Casualty, a Misfits tribute band. They released a self-titled 7&quot; with proceeds going to the Attic Youth Center in Philadelphia.

In early 2013, Leo and Aimee Mann formed a duo called The Both, after Leo had toured with Mann for several months as her supporting act. He and Mann began writing songs together, and in March 2013, the duo performed their first show together as the Both (originally formatted as #BOTH). Their self-titled debut album, &quot;The Both&quot;, was released in April 2014.

Leo released his debut solo album &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; on September 8, 2017. The album was inspired by several years of career and personal hardships, including the loss of a daughter in 2011 due to a late-term miscarriage in which Leo&#x27;s wife was forced to go into premature labor.

For the 2019 animated television film &quot;Steven Universe: The Movie&quot;, Leo collaborated with Rebecca Sugar and Stemage to write the song &quot;Independent Together&quot;. In the film, Leo voiced the role of Steg, a fusion of Steven Universe and Greg Universe. As Steg, Leo performed &quot;Independent Together&quot; alongside Aimee Mann (who reprised her role as Opal from the &quot;Steven Universe&quot; television series) and voice actress Deedee Magno Hall (as Pearl).

== Family and personal life ==
Leo grew up in New Jersey before moving to South Bend to attend Notre Dame, where he formed Chisel. He then moved to D.C., and briefly moved to Boston thereafter. Leo has lived in Rhode Island since 2005, and he also maintained an apartment in New York City until 2016.

Leo met his wife, musician, and visual artist Jodi Buonanno, in the late 1990s when both were touring in bands. She is credited with clapping, whistle, and background vocals on the &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot; album, as well as bass on &quot;The Tyranny of Distance&quot;.

His brothers, Chris and Danny Leo, are also musicians and have been members of bands such as Native Nod, The Lapse, The Van Pelt, The Vague Angels, and The Holy Childhood.

Leo is a vegan, and has served as a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has made frequent radio appearances as a contributor to programs on WFMU, such as &quot;The Best Show with Tom Scharpling&quot;.

<doc id="1148092" wikidata="Q934257" url="?curid=1148092" title="Primordial fluctuations">
<text>Primordial fluctuations are density variations in the early universe which are considered the seeds of all structure in the universe. Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of cosmic inflation. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the scale factor during inflation caused quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the horizon, to &quot;freeze in&quot;.
At the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the initial conditions for structure formation.

The statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations can be inferred from observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and from measurements of the distribution of matter, e.g., galaxy redshift surveys. Since the fluctuations are believed to arise from inflation, such measurements can also set constraints on parameters within inflationary theory.

==Formalism==

Primordial fluctuations are typically quantified by a power spectrum which gives the power of the variations as a function of spatial scale. Within this formalism, one usually considers the fractional energy density of the fluctuations, given by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the energy density, formula_3 its average and formula_4 the wavenumber of the fluctuations. The power spectrum formula_5 can then be defined via the ensemble average of the Fourier components:
:formula_6

There are both scalar and tensor modes of fluctuations.

===Scalar modes===
Scalar modes have the power spectrum defined as the mean squared density fluctuation for a specific wavenumber formula_7, i.e., the average fluctuation amplitude at a given scale:
:formula_8

Many inflationary models predict that the scalar component of the fluctuations obeys a power law in which
:formula_9
For scalar fluctuations, formula_10 is referred to as the scalar spectral index, with formula_11 corresponding to scale invariant fluctuations (not scale invariant in formula_12 but in the comoving curvature perturbation formula_13 for which the power formula_14 is indeed invariant with formula_7 when formula_16).

The scalar &quot;spectral index&quot; describes how the density fluctuations vary with scale. As the size of these fluctuations depends upon the inflaton&#x27;s motion when these quantum fluctuations are becoming super-horizon sized, different inflationary potentials predict different spectral indices. These depend upon the slow roll parameters, in particular the gradient and curvature of the potential. In models where the curvature is large and positive formula_17. On the other hand, models such as monomial potentials predict a red spectral index formula_18. Planck provides a value of formula_19.

===Tensor modes===
The presence of primordial tensor fluctuations is predicted by many inflationary models. As with scalar fluctuations, tensor fluctuations are expected to follow a power law and are parameterized by the tensor index (the tensor version of the scalar index). The ratio of the tensor to scalar power spectra is given by
:formula_20
where the 2 arises due to the two polarizations of the tensor modes. 2015 CMB data from the Planck satellite gives a constraint of formula_21.

==Adiabatic/isocurvature fluctuations==

Adiabatic fluctuations are density variations in all forms of matter and energy which have equal fractional over/under densities in the number density. So for example, an adiabatic photon overdensity of a factor of two in the number density would also correspond to an electron overdensity of two. For isocurvature fluctuations, the number density variations for one component do not necessarily correspond to number density variations in other components. While it is usually assumed that the initial fluctuations are adiabatic, the possibility of isocurvature fluctuations can be considered given current cosmological data. Current cosmic microwave background data favor adiabatic fluctuations and constrain uncorrelated isocurvature cold dark matter modes to be small.

<text>The Aransas River is a short river in south Texas in the United States. It drains an area of the south Texas coastal plains into the Gulf of Mexico. It rises in Bee County southwest of Beeville and north of Skidmore, from the confluence of three creeks: Olmos, Aransas, and Poesta. It flows generally south and southeast in a highly winding course, entering Copano Bay on the Gulf of Mexico along the Refugio-Aransas county line, approximately northwest of Rockport.

For some of the period when Texas was a state in Mexico, the Aransas formed the southwestern boundary, separating it from the neighboring Mexican state of Coahuila.

There&#x27;s good fishing in this river in Woodsboro.

<text>Elduvík () is a small village in the Faroe Islands.

Elduvík is located in the Funningsfjørður-inlet on Eysturoy&#x27;s northeast side. The village which has a population of 12 is split into two parts by a small river Stórá. Visible from Elduvík is the nearby island of Kalsoy.

The village lies by the shore at the end of a long, lush valley surrounded by stunning mountains. West of the river is the old part of the village, where the colourful small houses surround the school and the church.

On the other side of the river is the dock, where boathouses form an amphitheatre-like semi circle around the pier. From here, the old village path passes through a hillside to the town of Oyndarfjørður, where Elduvík locals attended church before the village got its own church.

The church in Elduvík was inaugurated in 1951, although the churchyard has been used since 1926 to avoid the hassle of carrying dead bodies along the old village path to Oyndarfjørður.

The magnificent gorge to the east of the village is popular with divers, who are treated to a spectacular undersea landscape with a rich population of crabs on the bottom of the sea. Elduvík is a heavy surf area, and visitors are advised to beware of big waves crashing on the shore. Elduvík offers you a variety of charming yards, paths, steps, and ledges. Elduvik Camping is a small campsite in the village on the Funningsfjørdur. There are a nice walking area. 

==The legend of Marmennil==

Anfinnur was a farmer in Elduvík and the legend concerns his encounter with a beast called Marmennil.

According to the legend, Marmennil has the appearance of a small human with long fingers, and lives at the bottom of the sea. He would tease fishermen by eating their bait, then attaching their hooks to the sea bed so that they would break their fishing lines. One day, however, Marmennil was fixing Anfinnur&#x27;s hook to the bottom when the hook became fixed in his hand, and he was pulled up into Anfinnur&#x27;s boat. The fishermen in the boat made the sign of the cross, and then brought Marmennil home with them.

He proved to be very useful on their fishing trips, so they always took him with them, remembering always to make the sign of the cross on him when he was taken on board. As soon as there were fish under the boat, Marmennil would start to laugh and play, and the fishermen could then make their catch.

Anfinnur kept Marmennil for a long time, but one day the sea was so rough that they forgot to make the sign of the cross. Because of this, when they were afloat, Marmennil sneaked overboard into the sea and was never seen again.

<text>Fámjin () is a village located on the western side of Suðuroy, the southernmost island in Faroe Islands. Fámjin is looking directly out to the North Atlantic Ocean. 
== Name ==
Tradition says that Fámjin used to be called Vesturvik. One day two men from the village were out on the sea fishing from their boat. There they saw a French sailship just lying there waiting for wind. The two men invited two ladies into their boat to see a large halibut. When the ladies were on board the men quickly rowed towards their village with them. From the sail-ship they heard the Frenchmen shout &quot;Femmes ... Femmes&quot;. After that day Vesturvik was called Fámjin. These things are said to have happened in the 16th century.

==Geography==
The village of Fámjin faces the ocean, although partly protected by a stone reef, which becomes visible at low tide. The village is surrounded by some of the highest mountains on Suðuroy. The highest mountain, Gluggarnir is located north of Fámjin. The mountains Borgarknappur and Borgin are south-east of the village. There are several inland lakes and waterfalls. One of the waterfalls is named Fossurin Mikli. Only one road leads to the village, it goes through Øravík.

North of the village lies the “Kirkjuvatn” (Church Lake), one of the largest on the island. The old mountain path between Fámjin and Vágur was originally the main road between the two villages. There are cairns along the path. West of Fámjin by the end of the road is a gorge which is called Prestgjógv (The Priest&#x27;s Gorge).

Fámjin is 9 km west of Øravík, which is on the west coast. Øravík is located on the east coast, around 3 km south of Krambatangi ferry port. The distance from Fámjin to Tvøroyri is 16 km. The distance from Fámjin to Vágur is 29 km.

== History ==
The church in Fámjin was built in 1875, it was ready to use in 1876. In the church there is a runestone from the 16th century (&quot;see Fámjin stone&quot;) (Faroese: Fámjinssteinurin). The stone bears both Latin and Runic letters. The stone is dated to the time after the Faroese reformation in 1538, and proves that runes were used up to as late as the 16th century. It is the youngest of the Faroese runestones.

In the church is the prototype of the Faroese flag Merkið. This flag was made by Jens Oliver Lisberg from Fámjin and others while they were studying in Copenhagen in Denmark in 1919. The first time &quot;Merkið&quot; was used in the Faroe Islands, was on June 22, 1919 in Fámjin, the occasion was a wedding.
&quot;Merkið&quot; was not officially recognized in the beginning. However during World War II, the United Kingdom prohibited the use of the flag of Denmark on Faroese ships as Denmark was at that time occupied by Germany. Therefore Merkið was run up on the ships instead. (April 25, 1940 is the official date of recognition)
Not until the verification of the home rule act in 1948 was Merkið recognized as the official flag of the Faroe Islands.

== Culture ==
Fámjin is well situated near rich fishing grounds. In the harbor, which is well-protected by the natural environment, the fishing boats moor in the summer at a small wharf. During the winter the boats are pulled in from the quay and kept in boat houses nearby. As in other villages both fishing and sheep farming is a part of the daily routine. The sheep are gathered and led to slaughter in October.

During the summer months, however, the population increases significantly due to the many people from Fámjin who live in other villages on the Faroe Islands and in other countries, but return in the sheep herding and hay season, which takes place from the beginning of July to the end of August. This is the case in many small Faroese villages. The past years the number of tourists who visit the village has been increasing. The tourists come especially for one reason, they wish to see the original Faroese flag, Merkið, which is hanging inside the church. There are some houses for rent and a coffeeshop is next to the harbour. Tourists enjoy also to go for a walk up the hill behind the church to the lake Kirkjuvatn. The name means The Lake of the Church.

<text>The lechwe, red lechwe, or southern lechwe (Kobus leche) is an antelope found in wetlands of south-central Africa.

==Range==
The lechwe is native to Botswana, Zambia, southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northeastern Namibia, and eastern Angola, especially in the Okavango Delta, Kafue Flats, and Bangweulu Wetlands. The species is fairly common in zoos and wild animal farms.

==Description==
Adult lechwe typically stand at the shoulder and generally weigh from , with males being larger than females. They are golden brown with white bellies. Males are darker in colour, but exact hue and amount of blackish on the front legs, chest and body varies depending on subspecies. The long, spiral horns are vaguely lyre-shaped and borne only by males. The hind legs are somewhat longer in proportion than in other antelopes to ease long-distance running on marshy soil.

==Habitats==
Lechwe are found in marshy areas where they are an important herbivore of aquatic plants, as well as grasses that are found in flooded meadows. They use the knee-deep water as protection from predators. Their legs are covered in a water-repellant substance which allows them to run quite fast in knee-deep water. Lechwe are diurnal. They gather in herds which can include many thousands of individuals. Herds are usually all of one sex, but during mating season they mix.

==Taxonomy==

===Subspecies===

Four subspecies of the lechwe have been recognized.

* Common red lechwe (&quot;Kobus leche leche&quot;) - Widely distributed in the wetlands of Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia.
* Kafue Flats lechwe (&quot;Kobus leche kafuensis&quot;) - It is confined within the Kafue Flats (seasonally inundated flood-plain on the Kafue River, Zambia).
* Roberts&#x27; lechwe (&quot;Kobus leche robertsi&quot;) - Formerly found in northeastern Zambia, now extinct. Also called the Kawambwa lechwe.
* Black lechwe (&quot;Kobus leche smithemani&quot;) - Found in the Bangweulu region of Zambia.

In addition, the Upemba lechwe (&quot;Kobus anselli&quot;) and the extinct Cape lechwe (&quot;Kobus venterae&quot;) are also considered subspecies by some authorities (as &quot;Kobus leche anselli&quot; and &quot;Kobus leche venterae&quot;).

Although related and sharing the name &quot;lechwe&quot;, the Nile lechwe (&quot;K. megaceros&quot;) is consistently recognized as a separate species.

==Reproduction==
Lechwe mate during rain seasons of November to February. They have a gestation period of seven to eight months so a majority of calves are born from July to September. Although rare, hybrids between lechwe and waterbuck have been observed.

<text>Froðba () is a village located farthest out on the north brink of Trongisvágsfjørður, an inlet on the east coast of the island of Suðuroy in the Faroe Islands.

==History==
The village has eventually merged with the harbour-city of Tvøroyri. 
Froðba is usually divided into smaller places such as Hamri, Undir Skorum, Støðlunum, Torvheyggur and Bøur. Bøur is usually referred to as &quot;Úti á Bø&quot; the oldest inhabited area in Froðba, Bøur has a small graveyard which used to be the only one in Trongisvágsfjørður. It is no longer in use and Froðba used to have a church which was in Bø but after Froðba merged with the growing nearby town of Tvøroyri, the small church was moved to Tvøroyri, and later as the population grew the church was replaced and moved to Sandvík.

Tradition says that Froðba is the oldest village on Suðuroy and in the Faroe Islands. A legendary Danish king, Frode or Fróði, ran ashore and settled here. The place is named after him. The name Froðba was originally Fróðabæ, in Norse, which means &quot;Frode-village or settlement&quot;. The name &quot;Fróðabæ&quot; has changed to &quot;Froðabø&quot; and finally &quot;Froðaba&quot; and Froðba; the Faroese word &quot;bø&quot; translates into &quot;place&quot;, &quot;dwelling&quot;, &quot;settlement&quot; or &quot;village&quot; in English. The word also has a second meaning, which is &quot;field&quot; or &quot;meadow&quot; in English.
Note that other villages on Suðuroy share the ending &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;Bæ&quot;, &quot;Bø&quot; such as Hvalba and Sumba.
The old church in Froðba housed a rune stone which was taken to Denmark in 1823 and cataloged in the Nationalmuseet but lost and rediscovered in 2003. Due to some mix up and in cataloguing since its rediscovery the rune stone&#x27;s whereabouts are to this day unknown.

==Heliport==
There is a heliport near Froðba (at ), the only with public traffic on Suðuroy. There are helicopter flights to Tórshavn and Vágar Airport.

<text>Fuglafjørður () is a village on Eysturoy&#x27;s east coast in the Faroe Islands. Its name means &quot;fjord of birds&quot;.

The village is at the edge of a bay and expands into the surrounding steep hills. 
The town centre is located close to the harbour and contains most of the shops and services. The harbour in Fuglafjørður is busy, as the town&#x27;s economy is based on the processing of fish and fish meal. There is fishing-industry, a slip, production of trawl and also oil-depots. 

In the past years Fuglafjørður has also become famous for its newly established cultural centre in the town centre that has become one of the main cultural attractions in Eysturoy.

== History and development ==
Where the Gjógvará stream meets the sea in the village, archaeologists have discovered the remains of a Viking longhouse, seventeen metres in length, with walls thick. It was found by removing four or five more recent layers of ruins, showing a continuity of habitation for many centuries.

In the 1840s the small village Hellur in north of Fuglafjørður was established. However this village never grew large and now only approximately 30 of the municipality&#x27;s inhabitants live there.

In the 1980s the suburb of Kambsdalur was established, where around 180 people live. In Kambsdalur there is also a large industrial cluster, the educational centre of the northeastern Faroes and the regional sportscentre used mainly for handball, volleyball and indoor football.
==Sports==
The local football team is ÍF Fuglafjørður.

<doc id="1148117" wikidata="Q5151783" url="?curid=1148117" title="Comic book death">
<text>In the comic book fan community, the apparent death and subsequent return of a long-running character is often called a comic book death. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes. The term is usually not applied to characters who have the ability to return from the dead as an established power or ability, such as Solomon Grundy or Ra&#x27;s al Ghul.

==Context==
Commenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer Geoff Johns said: &quot;Death in superhero comics is cyclical in its nature, and that&#x27;s for a lot of reasons, whether they are story reasons, copyright reasons, or fan reasons&quot;. The phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer Danny Fingeroth suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both ageless and immortal.

A common expression regarding comic book death was once &quot;No one stays dead except Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben&quot;, referring to the seminal importance of those characters&#x27; deaths to the title character: Captain America&#x27;s sidekick (retconned dead in 1964), Batman&#x27;s second Robin (dead in 1988), and Spider-Man&#x27;s uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the Red Hood and Bucky was retconned to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, and brought back as the Winter Soldier who had remained in the shadows for decades. Though, the same can&#x27;t be said for Uncle Ben.

Because death in American super-hero comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously; when a character dies, readers feel very little sense of loss, and are simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.

==Notable examples==
Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 &quot;death&quot; of Jean Grey in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; and that of Superman in DC&#x27;s highly publicized 1993 &quot;Death of Superman&quot; storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman&#x27;s death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story, Jean&#x27;s passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor Jim Shooter felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed mass murder. Despite this, the story was retconned a few years later to facilitate Jean&#x27;s return.

In 2007, the death of Captain America made real-world headlines when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in &quot;Captain America: Reborn&quot; two years later in 2009.

Planters cited comic book deaths (particularly those adapted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) as the inspiration for a storyline killing off its century-old mascot Mr. Peanut in January 2020 and having him reborn as a baby the next month.

An early prime time television version of this plot trope is in the 1970s original superhero series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; after the 2-part episode &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; produced spectacular ratings. With that unexpected success, the producers wanted to produce a spinoff series featuring the character despite the fact that Jaime Sommers was killed off on the operating table from bionic rejection at the story&#x27;s conclusion. To do so, a story in the next season, &quot;Return of the Bionic Woman,&quot; was produced where Steve Austin discovers that Jaime had been placed in cryogenic freezing at another doctor&#x27;s insistence after she was declared dead, which allowed her medical condition to be successfully treated enough to revive her, albeit without her memory of Steve Austin.

==In-universe acknowledgement==


Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. Professor X has commented &quot;in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors&quot;. When Siryn was made aware of her father&#x27;s death, she refused to mourn him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an X-Man, he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends. Her father is restored to life but is recruited by the Apocalypse Twins as part of their new Horsemen of Apocalypse.

Stating that he often pondered why superheroes return to life, Reed Richards said &quot;it&#x27;s almost proof of a higher power, of someone who needs us to live to stop what&#x27;s coming. To fight the good fight&quot;. The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; bemoaned to reporter Ben Urich about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or supervillain. In one issue of &quot;The Incredible Hercules&quot;, there is a betting game for then deceased superheroes to return to life.

<text>Paco Dècina is an Italian choreographer.

Decina was born in Naples in 1955, and studied science, before becoming interested in classical dance and African dance. He worked with several dance companies in Rome where he discovered contemporary dance and adopted American influences. In 1984, he moved to Paris; two years later, he became an instructor at the Conservatory of Champigny-sur-Marne. In 1986, he founded the Post-Retroguardia company, and in June 1987 he won the Ménagerie de Verre choreography prize with &quot;Tempi morti&quot;, for five dancers (Milan 1987). &quot;Circumvesuviana&quot; (from the name of the train serving villages at the foot of Vesuvius) was produced in February 1988 at the Théâtre d’Ivry, and made Decina&#x27;s name.

<doc id="1148121" wikidata="Q248603" url="?curid=1148121" title="Graceful prinia">
<text>The graceful prinia (Prinia gracilis) is a small warbler (in some older works it is referred to as graceful warbler). This prinia is a resident breeder in northeastern Africa (the Nile valley in particular) and southern Asia, from Egypt and Somalia east to Saudi Arabia, where it is sometimes called streaked wren-warbler.

This active passerine bird is typically found in shrub or tall grass in a variety of habitats with thick undergrowth, tamarisks or similar cover. Graceful prinia builds its nest in a bush or grass and lays 3 to 5 eggs.

These 10–11 cm long warblers have short rounded wings, and a long tapering tail with each feather tipped with black and white. In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with dark streaking. The underparts are whitish with buff flanks, and the bill is short and black.
The sexes are similar. In winter, adults are brighter sandy brown above with weaker streaking, there is more buff on the sides, and the bill is paler.

There are 7 subspecies.

The long tail is often cocked, and the flight of this species is weak. Like most warblers, the graceful prinia is insectivorous. The call is a rolling trilled &quot;breep&quot;, and the song is a hard rolling repetition of &quot;zerlip&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
A study published in 2021 concludes that the graceful prinia should be split from the delicate prinia.
* &quot;Prinia gracilis&quot;, graceful prinia, 7 subspecies:
** &quot;Prinia gracilis gracilis&quot;, River Nile from Egypt to southern Sudan,
** &quot;Prinia gracilis deltae&quot;, River Nile delta to western Israel,
** &quot;Prinia gracilis palaestinae&quot;, Lebanon to northwestern Saudi Arabia,
** &quot;Prinia gracilis natronensis&quot;, Wadi Natron, northern Egypt,
** &quot;Prinia gracilis carlo&quot;, Red Sea coast from northeastern Sudan to Somalia,
** &quot;Prinia gracilis yemenensis&quot;, western Saudi Arabia, Yemen, southern Oman, 
** &quot;Prinia gracilis hufufae&quot;, Bahrain, northeastern Saudi Arabia;
The International Ornithological Congress followed this change in an update later that year.

<text>Talcahuano () (From Mapudungun &quot;Tralkawenu&quot;, &quot;Thundering Sky&quot;) is a port city and commune in the Biobío Region of Chile. It is part of the Greater Concepción conurbation. Talcahuano is located in the south of the Central Zone of Chile.

==Geography==
Together with ten other municipalities, it forms part of the Concepción Province, which in turn is one of four provinces that forms the VIII Region of Biobío Region.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Talcahuano spans an area of and has 250,348 inhabitants (121,778 men and 128,570 women). Of these, 248,964 (99.4%) lived in urban areas and 1,384 (0.6%) in rural areas. The population grew by 59.9% (93,766 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. With a population density of 1,873 inhabitants per square kilometre, it is the seventh most populated city of the country.

== History ==
The official foundation date of Talcahuano is 5 November 1764 when Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga declared it an official port. However, the site of Talcahuano began to appear in history books as early as 1544 when Genoese captain Juan Bautista Pastene discovered the mouth of the Biobío river while exploring the coast in his ships &quot;San Pedro&quot; and &quot;Santiaguillo&quot;. In 1601 Alonso de Ribera built Fort Talcahueno to defend remaining Spanish settlements near Concepción.

The city is named after an Araucanian chief, Talcahueñu, who inhabited the region at the arrival of the Spanish. In Mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuches, Talcahuano means &quot;Thundering Sky&quot;.

The port was well known to American whaleships of the 19th century. They often put in for fresh water, food, and various forms of entertainment for the crews.

On 24 January 1939 at around 23.33 the city was hit by a major earthquake of 8.3 which had an epicenter close to the city of Chillán. The Chilean Government requested from the British Government the help of two British cruisers HMS Ajax (22) and HMS Exeter (68) then visiting the city of Valparaíso to head south to investigate. The ships arrived at Talcahuano on 25th, many of the city&#x27;s main buildings had been destroyed with little power, food or water available to the survivors. The two ships crews helped with rubble clearing, rescuing those still trapped, recovering bodies as well as the ships taking trips north to Valparaiso with those injured and refugees.

===27 February 2010 earthquake===
On 27 February 2010 Talcahuano was devastated by the 8.8 magnitude 2010 Chile earthquake and its subsequent tsunami. These back-to-back disasters left 80% of the city&#x27;s residents homeless. 
 The tsunami is estimated to have been more than 7.5 feet high. After a week, there are only 20 reported deaths, and 18 missing. The city government estimates that it will take 10 years to recover from the quake and tsunami. The local government has been turning away tent aid, as they want to make permanent shelters rather than have permanent tent camps.

== Economy ==
Talcahuano contains Chile&#x27;s Productive development Pillar of the development of the city, the productive activities represent the motor of the advance of Talcahuano in a globalized world. From tourism, our marine gastronomy, the nautical qualities of the bay, to industry, trade in services, products and the logistics platform. Talcahuano is an integral city that grows hand in hand with the spirit of its inhabitants. main naval base which is home of the historical relic, the &quot;Huáscar&quot;, a Peruvian ironclad ship (British-made), which was captured in 1879 during the War of the Pacific. It is also the base of the Chilean submarine fleet and the ASMAR shipyard.

==Administration==
As a commune, Talcahuano is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016 - 2020 alcalde is Henry Campos Coa (UDI).

The commune of Talcahuano has seventeen districts, the three most populous being Carriel, San Vicente and San Miguel, which together account for about 46% of the population of the commune. Only two of the districts contain any rural population: Tumbes with 5% rural and Carrie with ½%.

<text>Faudel Belloua (; born June 6, 1978) is a French raï singer and actor of Algerian descent. He released studio albums, notably &quot;Baïda&quot;, &quot;Samra&quot;, &quot;Un Autre Soleil&quot; and &quot;Mundial Corrida&quot; and the live album &quot;1,2,3 Soleils&quot; jointly with Khaled and Rachid Taha.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Mantes-la-Jolie, a suburb of Paris, and raised by Algerian-born immigrant parents in the &quot;Val Fourré&quot; neighborhood, the young Faudel was introduced to Algerian raï by his grandmother who performed regularly in Oran with the , groups of female musicians who play traditional folk raï at weddings and other family occasions. It was Amaria, Faudel&#x27;s grandmother, who was largely responsible for teaching him traditional raï rhythms during the summer holidays in Algeria.

His first public singing experience was during a family wedding celebration in Oran, Algeria. Faudel started to cover the popular tracks by Cheb Khaled and Cheb Mami at 12, after which he soon fronted the popular band &quot;Les Etoiles du Raï&quot; (The Rai Stars). Faudel and &quot;Les Etoiles du Rai&quot; soon became a well-known fixture at the youth club and other local associations in Mantes-la-Jolie. Faudel then went on to appear at clubs throughout the Paris suburbs, performing covers of Khaled, Zahouania and Mami&#x27;s greatest hits, accompanied by a pre-recorded backing tape.

The turning-point of Faudel&#x27;s early career came at the age of 13 when he was spotted at Printemps de Bourges by Mohamed Mestar (aka Momo). Mestar, an ex-guitarist, had recently set up an association in the suburbs to promote up-and-coming local artists and, after catching one of Faudel&#x27;s concerts, he offered to take charge of the young Rai singer&#x27;s career. Thanks to Momo&#x27;s guiding hand, Faudel soon built up his own repertoire and began collaborating with different artists, and playing in a few Cheb Mami and MC Solaar concerts as well. Faudel went on to study accountancy and metallurgy, but his passion for Rai soon led to him taking up a professional singing career.

Faudel&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Baïda&quot;, was released in 1997. A year later, he was invited to sing with Khaled and Rachid Taha in the &quot;1, 2, 3 Soleils&quot; concert in Paris. His collaboration with them made him a household name in France and Algeria. His other albums include &quot;Samra&quot; and his album &quot;Un Autre Soleil&quot; (released Sept. 2003) and, most recently, &quot;Mundial Corrida&quot; (2006). He also has acted in a few roles, including &quot;Happenstance&quot; (&quot;Le Battement d&#x27;ailes du papillon&quot;) with Audrey Tautou.

Even though Faudel was still in his early teens, he managed to establish himself as the new voice of Rai. Indeed, in 1995 two French television documentaries were made about the rising young star from Mantes-la-Jolie - &quot;Saga cités&quot; (which was broadcast on the state-owned channel France 3) and &quot;Les Enfants du Rai&quot; (broadcast on the Franco-German channel Arte). The following year Faudel would be chosen to represent the Ile-de-France region at the prestigious Printemps de Bourges Festival. And the young singer&#x27;s impressive performance in the New Talent category would only serve to increase his growing popularity.

Meanwhile, Faudel embarked on a new series of concert tours while Momo set about getting his young protégé a recording deal. In order to produce the best demo tape possible, Momo and Faudel flew out to New York in January 1996 to record three tracks with session musicians at the legendary Record Plant studios. The demo tape would actually prove unnecessary - after Faudel&#x27;s impressive performance at the Printemps de Bourges, the young star was snapped up by major record label Mercury shortly afterward. Faudel&#x27;s original sound - which fuses traditional Amazigh Rai rhythms with &#x27;new wave&#x27; guitar, reggae, Afro-beat and vibrant flamenco rhythms - was now set to hit the big time.

After signing a contract with Mercury to produce five albums over the next few years, Faudel decided to quit school. The young singer then embarked upon another major concert tour, performing dates throughout France and Europe. In the course of this new tour Faudel would appear in concert with a number of legendary Rai stars such as Khaled and Cheb Mami. Meanwhile, Faudel&#x27;s catchy new Rai sound would reach a whole new audience when it was used as part of the soundtrack to Ariel Zeitoun&#x27;s film &quot;Elle est Belle la Vie&quot;.

===&quot;Baïda&quot;===
Faudel soon caught on with the French media too, journalists and music critics dubbing him (The Little Prince of Rai). The Little Prince of Rai soon went into the studio to record his début album &quot;Baïda&quot; (Blonde). Released in October 1997, Faudel&#x27;s album combined a &quot;light&quot; modern Rai style with hard-hitting lyrics. (Faudel&#x27;s songs deal with everything from broken hearts to the problems of France&#x27;s second-generation immigrants). The first single release from the album, &quot;Tellement N&#x27;brick&quot; (I Love You So Much), went on to become a huge hit on community radio during the Muslim month of Ramadan (January 1998).

Following the success of &quot;Tellement N&#x27;brick&quot;, &quot;Baïda&quot; was nominated in the &#x27;traditional music&#x27; category at the &quot;Victoires de la Musique&quot; awards in February 1998. On April 15, Faudel was invited to perform at the Printemps de Bourges Festival once again.

Following the release of his début album, Faudel went on to perform a whole string of concerts, delighting music fans up and down the country. On September 26 the Little Prince of Rai appeared in concert with Khaled and Rachid Taha at Bercy stadium in Paris, attracting a crowd of 15,000 Rai fans. He then went on to continue his successful national tour. The live album of the Bercy concert (entitled &quot;1.2.3. Soleils&quot;) proved to be an overwhelming success with the French public and the three Rai Tenors were soon inundated with invitations to appear on all the top TV shows.

His 1997 music video called &quot;Tellement Je T&#x27;aime&quot; featured Ukrainian born, model and actress, future &quot;James Bond&#x27;s girl&quot; Olga Kurylenko.

At the beginning of 1999 the popular Rai trio were back in the limelight again with a new single. They had already performed the song - an Arabic adaptation of Jacques Revaux&#x27;s legendary French classic &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (the French &quot;My Way&quot;) - at their Bercy concert and the single proved instantly popular with French music fans. On 20 February 1999 the trio were invited to perform the song at the &quot;Victoires de la Musique&quot; (the annual French music awards). Faudel triumphed at the award ceremony that night, when television viewers voted him Best Newcomer of the Year. Following this triumph, Faudel went on to bring the house down when he performed two concerts at the Olympia on March 10 and 11.

In the summer of 1999 the young Rai star set off on a mini tour of Tunisia, performing six concerts which brought the famous &quot;Faudel Tour&quot; (the extensive international tour he had launched at the beginning of the year) to a triumphant end.

Faudel&#x27;s career continues to go from strength to strength as his modern Rai sound attracts a whole new following of fans. However, while Faudel is very much the &#x27;happening young Rai star of the moment&#x27;, his music should certainly not be dismissed as a passing fad. On the contrary, the lyrics of Faudel&#x27;s songs are an important social comment, expressing the hopes and frustrations of a whole generation of French-born Algerians growing up in the Paris suburbs today.

===&quot;Samra&quot;===
During the summer of 2000, Faudel performed at the Summer Stage Festival in New York.

Meanwhile, he went back to work on his next album, &quot;Samra&quot;. The album included 6 French and 7 Arabic songs. The Mercury release booklet contains sung texts in French and Arabic in romanization. The songs were written and arranged by Nabil Khalidi (a collaborator of Rachid Taha) and Goh Hotoda (a well-known remixer), and were produced by Mohamed Mestar who has been following Faudel since 1993. &quot;Samra&quot; remained faithful to the raï tradition, while presenting more synthetic rhythms and Arabic pop features, as well as new Latino touches—especially for the song &quot;Salsa raï&quot; performed in a duo with Yuri Buenaventura. More than in his previous albums, the lyrics focused on love rather than on his usual social comments, except for one track that referred to Mantes-la-Jolie, the inner-city where the artist grew up and still lives in. Released in February 2001, and following the great success of &quot;Baïda&quot;, which topped the 350,000 mark; this new album charted in France, Belgium and Switzerland.

===&quot;Un Autre Soleil&quot; and &quot;Mundial Corrida&quot;===
In 2003, the singer went back to the recording studio to work on a new album. On September 2, 2003, Faudel released &quot;Un Autre Soleil&quot;, his most mature album so far. The artist had to compromise with his record company that insisted on his producing an exclusively Arabic album, yet he also managed to impose songs in French. With the help of songwriter Patrick Dupond who had collaborated with Florent Pagny, Faudel composed very personal lyrics such as those of &quot;Petit Etre&quot; — dealing with his recently born son. Marion Michau penned the first single to be aired on the French radios &quot;Je Veux Vivre&quot;. Bands like Zebda, the Négresses Vertes and Zen Zila also came to collaborate on the record. With a strong Mediterranean feel, the album should enable Faudel to meet with a larger and larger audience.

Faudel worked on a new album called &quot;Mundial Corrida&quot;. This, the Rai star&#x27;s fourth album to date, was released in September 2006. On &quot;Mundial Corrida&quot;, produced by Fred Chateau and Volodia, Faudel affirmed his double French and Algerian identity, celebrating his two cultures on &quot;Mon Pays&quot;, the first single release which received extensive airplay. The French singer, songwriter and composer Pascal Obispo also contributed several tracks to the album.

=== The return ===
In 2017, Faudel recorded the bilingual Arabic and French language single &quot;Rani&quot; as a duo with singer Mohammed Assaf, who was the 2013 &quot;Arab Idol&quot; winner.

A track recorded in collaboration with RedOne, &quot;All Day, All Night&quot; was released on April 26, 2018.

On April 16, 2019, a new song was unveiled, Mon Dieu, follow it in 2020 with two songs Histoire Chaba and Smile.

==Acting career==
Besides his singing career, the young star of Raï music decided to take a new turn towards acting and accepted a part in the French film, &quot;Battement d’ailes du papillon&quot;. Following that part, Faudel continued to read a lot of scripts, but remained on the lookout for the right part that would turn him into a star of the big screen.

As an actor he also took part in a television series entitled &quot;Sami&quot;. He played a Tunisian student working as a supervisor in a French high school.

In 2004, Faudel made a comeback on cinema screens, starring in Merzak Allouache&#x27;s film &quot;Bab el web&quot; alongside Samy Naceri and Julie Gayet. He played the role of a young man from the Bab el Oued neighbourhood in Algiers.

==Personal life==
Faudel has a trio French, Moroccan and Algerian nationality. In February 2002, his partner gave birth to a boy named Enzy.

<text>Shannonville Motorsport Park is a motorsport road course circuit in Canada. It is located east of Belleville, Ontario, roughly midway between Toronto and Montreal, Quebec, near Highway 401 and along the former Provincial Highway 2.

It has many configurations, and its tight layout with much run-off space makes it a very good venue for race testing. Many race teams from Toronto and Montreal test at Shannonville in preparation for events held on street circuits, as the Shannonville raceway shares a lot of the same characteristics.

The raceway first started off as a dirt oval, with bedrock for a front straight. Much later, the &quot;Nelson&quot; circuit was built, named after the late John Nelson, owner of the circuit at the time. From there, the &quot;Fabi&quot; circuit was built north of the Nelson, and the two were linked to form the , 14-corner &quot;Long Track&quot;. The Fabi circuit was named after Bertrand Fabi, a young Canadian driver who died while testing a Formula Three car in England. The Fabi circuit has a long backstraight that now doubles as a drag strip. A link was then made after the first corner on the Nelson circuit to the seventh corner of the Long Circuit, creating the &quot;Pro Circuit&quot; layout.

Currently, the Canadian Touring Car Championship makes an annual visit to the facility, as well as auto-racing body CASC (Regional Road Races). Drag racing is also heavily featured there.

== Lap records ==

As of October 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Shannonville Motorsports Park are listed as:

==Fatalities==
* On May 21, 2000, Glenn Schauble was killed, mid-pack, after losing control during a celebratory wheelie, while crossing the finish-line. This was his second Superbike race as a professional. He flipped over backwards at the checkered flag on the front straight, fell off his bike, a Yamaha YZF-R1 1000, and was hit by several riders following in a tight pack. Schauble suffered fatal head and neck injuries. The accident happened at the end of the Pro Superbike race, during a R.A.C.E. (Racing Associates Canada Events) Ontario Superseries meeting held at Shannonville. A computer sciences student, Schauble was in his first year as a pro racer. He had been promoted to pro status after winning championships in two of the three classes in which he competed in 1999 (Amateur Formula Race and Amateur open).
* On September 24, 2000, Schauble&#x27;s &quot;best friend&quot; Frank Wilson, Jr., also crashed at Shannonville on his regular Yamaha R6, in what he had intended to be his last race after seeing his friend Schauble die earlier that year and contemplating retirement. With the Canadian title already locked up for that season prior to that race, Wilson succumbed to his injuries at Kingston General Hospital. The incident happened after Wilson exited the pits for the 600 class warm-up lap. He crashed in Turn 2 of the Pro track in a single bike situation presumed to be due to highsiding on cold tires.

<text>Johann Maria Eduard Strauss III (; ; 16 February 18669 January 1939) was an Austrian composer whose father was Eduard Strauss, whose uncles were Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss, and whose grandfather was Johann Strauss I. Born in Vienna, he was unofficially entrusted with the task of upholding his family&#x27;s tradition after the dissolution of the Strauss Orchestra by his father in 1901. His talents were not fully realized during his lifetime as musical tastes had changed in the Silver Age with more popular composers such as Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus dominating the Viennese musical scene with their operettas, although his uncle, Johann Strauss II, supervised his development as a musician, a fact disputed by Eduard Strauss.

Despite Strauss’ keen interest in composing, he was better remembered as a conductor. His only stage work, the three-act operetta &quot;Katze und Maus&quot;, composed in 1898, premiered in Vienna on 23 December 1898, at the Theater an der Wien. Its public reaction bordered on utter dislike, and music critics called for the distraught composer to reassess himself and to appear under a pseudonym, in order not to tarnish the name of his famous relatives. He salvaged the music score and produced independent pieces of which the waltzes &quot;Sylvanien&quot;, Op. 1 and &quot;Leonie&quot;, Op. 2 survived obscurity.

Strauss also conducted from the violin in the style of the &quot;Vorgeiger&quot; and of his family. In 1903, he elevated the Strauss family to a new age of development when the Deutsche Grammophon AG of Germany recorded his conducting of the Johann Strauss Orchestra on eight single-sided records of works by his family. Principally, he was the first conductor in the Strauss family to actively conduct works to be recorded by prominent recording companies. His later works, such as &quot;Dem Muthigen gehört die Welt&quot; (&quot;The World Belongs to the Brave&quot;), Op. 25, &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; (&quot;Under the Linden Trees&quot;), Op. 30, and &quot;Krönungs-Walzer&quot; (&quot;Coronation Waltz&quot;), Op. 40 (the latter celebrating the coronation of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), were also considerably more popular than his earlier efforts.

He died in Berlin at the age of 72.

<doc id="1148129" wikidata="Q253829" url="?curid=1148129" title="Net (polyhedron)">
<text>In geometry, a net of a polyhedron is an arrangement of non-overlapping edge-joined polygons in the plane which can be folded (along edges) to become the faces of the polyhedron. Polyhedral nets are a useful aid to the study of polyhedra and solid geometry in general, as they allow for physical models of polyhedra to be constructed from material such as thin cardboard.

An early instance of polyhedral nets appears in the works of Albrecht Dürer, whose 1525 book &quot;A Course in the Art of Measurement with Compass and Ruler&quot; (&quot;Unterweysung der Messung mit dem Zyrkel und Rychtscheyd &quot;) included nets for the Platonic solids and several of the Archimedean solids. These constructions were first called nets in 1543 by Augustin Hirschvogel.

==Existence and uniqueness==

Many different nets can exist for a given polyhedron, depending on the choices of which edges are joined and which are separated. The edges that are cut from a convex polyhedron to form a net must form a spanning tree of the polyhedron, but cutting some spanning trees may cause the polyhedron to self-overlap when unfolded, rather than forming a net. Conversely, a given net may fold into more than one different convex polyhedron, depending on the angles at which its edges are folded and the choice of which edges to glue together. If a net is given together with a pattern for gluing its edges together, such that each vertex of the resulting shape has positive angular defect and such that the sum of these defects is exactly 4, then there necessarily exists exactly one polyhedron that can be folded from it; this is Alexandrov&#x27;s uniqueness theorem. However, the polyhedron formed in this way may have different faces than the ones specified as part of the net: some of the net polygons may have folds across them, and some of the edges between net polygons may remain unfolded. Additionally, the same net may have multiple valid gluing patterns, leading to different folded polyhedra.
In 1975, G. C. Shephard asked whether every convex polyhedron has at least one net, or simple edge-unfolding. This question, which is also known as Dürer&#x27;s conjecture, or Dürer&#x27;s unfolding problem, remains unanswered. There exist non-convex polyhedra that do not have nets, and it is possible to subdivide the faces of every convex polyhedron (for instance along a cut locus) so that the set of subdivided faces has a net. In 2014 Mohammad Ghomi showed that every convex polyhedron admits a net after an affine transformation. Furthermore, in 2019 Barvinok and Ghomi showed that a generalization of Dürer&#x27;s conjecture fails for &quot;pseudo edges&quot;, i.e., a network of geodesics which connect vertices of the polyhedron and form a graph with convex faces.
A related open question asks whether every net of a convex polyhedron has a blooming, a continuous non-self-intersecting motion from its flat to its folded state that keeps each face flat throughout the motion.

==Shortest path==
The shortest path over the surface between two points on the surface of a polyhedron corresponds to a straight line on a suitable net for the subset of faces touched by the path. The net has to be such that the straight line is fully within it, and one may have to consider several nets to see which gives the shortest path. For example, in the case of a cube, if the points are on adjacent faces one candidate for the shortest path is the path crossing the common edge; the shortest path of this kind is found using a net where the two faces are also adjacent. Other candidates for the shortest path are through the surface of a third face adjacent to both (of which there are two), and corresponding nets can be used to find the shortest path in each category.

The spider and the fly problem is a recreational mathematics puzzle which involves finding the shortest path between two points on a cuboid.

==Higher-dimensional polytope nets==

A net of a 4-polytope, a four-dimensional polytope, is composed of polyhedral cells that are connected by their faces and all occupy the same three-dimensional space, just as the polygon faces of a net of a polyhedron are connected by their edges and all occupy the same plane. The net of the tesseract, the four-dimensional hypercube, is used prominently in a painting by Salvador Dalí, &quot;Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)&quot; (1954). The same tesseract net is central to the plot of the short story &quot;—And He Built a Crooked House—&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein.

The number of combinatorially distinct nets of formula_1-dimensional hypercubes can be found by representing these nets as a tree on formula_2 nodes describing the pattern by which pairs of faces of the hypercube are glued together to form a net, together with a perfect matching on the complement graph of the tree describing the pairs of faces that are opposite each other on the folded hypercube. Using this representation, the number of different unfoldings for hypercubes of dimensions 2, 3, 4, ... have been counted as
:1, 11, 261, 9694, 502110, 33064966, 2642657228, ...

<doc id="1148149" wikidata="Q2418110" url="?curid=1148149" title="Hurufism">
<text>Hurufism ( &quot;ḥurūfiyyah&quot;, Persian: حُروفیان &quot;horūfiyān&quot;) was a Sufi movement based on the mysticism of letters (&quot;ḥurūf&quot;), which originated in Astrabad and spread to areas of western Iran (Persia) and Anatolia in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

== Foundation ==
The founder and spiritual head of the Hurufi movement was Fazlallah Astarabadi (1340–94). Born in Astrabad (now Gorgan, Iran), he was strongly drawn to Sufism and the teachings of Mansur al-Hallaj and Rumi at an early age. In the mid-1370s, Fazlallah started to propagate his teachings all over Iran and Azerbaijan. While living in Tabriz, Fazlallah gained an elite following in the court of the Jalairid Sultanate. At that time, Fazlallah was still in the mainstream of Sufi tradition. Later, he did move towards more esoteric spirituality, and, failing to convert Timur, was executed in 1394 near Alinja Tower in Nakhchivan by the ruler&#x27;s son, Miran Shah. The large uprising of Hurufis was crushed, but the popular movement survived for another decade or so in different guises.

Fazlallah&#x27;s greatest work was the &quot;Jāvdānnāme-ye Kabir&quot; (&quot;Great Book of Eternity&quot;), likely written in Baku before his arrest, which survived due to its dissemination due to copies made by his daughter Makhdumzāde. It was largely preserved in popular culture due to its use by dervishes of the Bektashi Order.
== Key elements ==
According to Fazlallah, the key to open the seventh sealed book, the Qurʾan, is a kabbalistic system of letters that is expounded by later Hurufis in the &quot;Hidayat Namah&quot;, &quot;Jawidan&quot; and in the &quot;Mahram Namah&quot;. The Universe is eternal and moves by rotation. Divine countenance is imperishable and is manifest in Man, the best of forms, &quot;zuhur kibriya&quot;. God is incarnated in every atom. Hurufis considered Fazlallah Astarabadi a manifestation of God&#x27;s force after Adam, Moses and Muhammad. God is also embodied in words and the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, and the 32 letters of the Persian alphabet are the basis for love and beauty in the world. Seven is a key number corresponding to noble parts of the face, the verses of &quot;Al-Fatiha&quot; and verbal confession of faith. Man is a supreme copy of the divine and the key to &quot;haqiqa&quot;.

According to R. N. Frye&#x27;s &quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot;, Hurufism was an expression of Isma&#x27;ilism in its mystical identification of the human figure but differed in its recognition of &quot;haqiqa&quot; in the substance of letters rather than in the person of the Imam.

== Impact ==
After Fazlallah&#x27;s death his ideas were further developed and propagated by Imadaddin Nasimi and &quot;certain accursed ones of no significance&quot; in Azerbaijan and Seyid Ishag in Turkey. The poet Imadaddin Nasimi (?–1417) and other Hurufis make kabbalistic tendencies subordinate to mystic concepts of Sufism, and specifically those of Mansur Al-Hallaj, who was another great influence on Imadaddin Nasimi.

Through Nasimi&#x27;s poetry Hurufi ideas influenced, to different degrees, people like Niyazi-i Misri, Fuzûlî, Habibi, Ismail I, and Rushani. The Bektashi Order, which is still active in Anatolia and the Balkans, was a repository for the Hurufi teachings and writings. One of Fazlallah&#x27;s personal students, Rafî&#x27;î, emigrated into the Balkans. He transmitted a central thesis of Hurufism, that the cardinalities of the Arabic and Persian alphabet respectively enumerate all types of shape and sound, by axes of symmetry. A Hurufi rebellion in Kwarezem was suppressed by the Mongols, and that motivated the exodus of Hurufis to the Balkans. The Bektashi manuscripts show almost 500 years of Hurufism in the Balkans, with a peak in the 1700s. Other Sufi orders, such as the Qadiriyya and the Naqshbandi, contributed in the collection, retrieval, and translation of Hurufi manuscripts.

===Hurufi manuscripts===
From the Balkans, a great number of records were recorded in what is today Albania, but the relation between Bektashism and Hurufism is evidenced from Greek transcriptions. In total, many of the Hurufi manuscripts that are existent today were safeguarded in the libraries of Bektashi lodges, including &quot;Fadl’Allah Yazdânî’s Cāvidān-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Shaykh Sāfî’s Hākikāt-Nāma, Ali’ûl-A’lâ’s Māhşar-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Amîr Gıyâs’ad-Dîn’s İstivâ-Nāme&quot;, &quot;Frişte Oğlu’s Ahirat-Nāma&quot;, and some other books written on &quot;Hurufi Theology&quot; like &quot;Aşık-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Hidāyat-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Mukāddama’t-ûl-Hākayık&quot;, &quot;Muhārram-Nāma-i Sayyid İshāk&quot;, &quot;Nihāyat-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Tûrāb-Nāma&quot;, &quot;Miftāh’ûl-Gayb&quot;, &quot;Tuhfat’ûl-Uşşak&quot;, &quot;Risâla-i Noktā&quot;, &quot;Risāle-i Hurûf&quot;, &quot;Risāla-i Fāzl’ûl-Lah&quot;, and &quot;Risāla-i Virān Abdāl&quot;. Hurufi terms and concepts permeate Bektāshi poetry. Gül Baba provided an extensive compendium of Hurufi ideas in &quot;The Key to the Unseen&quot;.

<doc id="1148155" wikidata="Q937264" url="?curid=1148155" title="Ali Osman Taha">
<text>Ali Osman Mohammed Taha (, also transliterated &quot;Othman&quot; or &quot;Uthman&quot;) (born 1 January 1944) is a Sudanese politician who was First Vice President of Sudan from July 2011 to December 2013. Previously he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1995, First Vice President from 1995 to January 2005, and Second Vice President from August 2005 to July 2011. He is a member of the National Congress Party.

Taha is a graduate of the Faculty of Law at the University of Khartoum. He then set up a private law practice before being appointed as a judge and then entering politics as a member of Sudan&#x27;s parliament in the 1980s.

Taha, along with John Garang, is credited as being the co-architect of Sudan&#x27;s Comprehensive Peace Agreement which brought Africa&#x27;s longest civil war to an end on 9 January 2005. The agreement capped an eight-year process to stop the civil war, which since 1983 had taken 2 million lives. Starting in December 2003 Taha and Garang met numerous times to finalize the peace agreement.

Taha heads the Sudanese side of the Sudanese-Egyptian High Committee, which was headed on the Egyptian side by Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and includes Ministers from both countries and aims to foster cooperation between the two countries.

Omar al-Bashir reappointed Taha as Second Vice President in May 2010 in spite of speculations that he would be replaced by a more hard-line NCP member or a Darfurian. Taha was viewed as a moderate figure in the NCP regime and a possible successor to Bashir, although some have suggested that Bashir might have preferred that his successor be a hard-liner.

Taha was arrested on April 11 2019 following the 2019 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état. 

On May 27, 2020, Sudan’s public prosecution service announced that Taha had tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently placed in quarantine.

==Involvement in the Darfur Crisis==
Taha was responsible for handling the Darfur crisis from 2003 to 2004. Community leaders in Darfur have reported that Taha holds personal ties with Musa Hilal and was instrumental in releasing Hilal from prison in 2003. Taha apparently assigned Hilal the authority to recruit and command a militia group, which became known as &quot;Quick, Light and Horrible Forces of Misteriha.&quot; Government help for Hilal was reported to be very open and was coordinated through Taha. Taha was quoted as saying to commanders of the Janjaweed militia, &quot;I don&#x27;t want one single village of Zurgas in Darfur. All the Zurga lands are yours.&quot; After an attack by the Janjaweed militia and the Armed Forces in the town of Kyla, a survivor from the Fur tribe reported that the attackers sang, &quot;Hail the name of Allah, our orders came from Ali Usman Taha.&quot;

In 2005 Taha opposed holding trials outside Sudan after 51 individuals were accused, by a United Nations commission of inquiry, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Taha argued that doing so would &quot;push things to degenerate rather than help people to reconcile or maintain peace.&quot; In 2008, Taha also opposed the ICC indictment of President Omar al-Bashir by arguing that, &quot;We can&#x27;t go along with implementing the CPA or other agreements with a president that is subject to international trial.&quot; In the same year, the Associated Press quoted reliable sources saying Taha would be charged with crimes similar to those that President Omar al-Bashir had been charged with. In February 2009, Taha reportedly traveled to Turkey seeking the nation&#x27;s support to save Sudan&#x27;s president, al-Bashir, from trial.

Taha is mentioned several times in the application of arrest for President Omar al-Bashir, submitted by Luis Moreno Ocampo, prosecutor of the ICC. For example, Commissioner Rabeh told Janjaweed militia commanders that the General Commander in Khartoum and Taha ordered the provision of armament for the elimination of zurgas. Zurga is a derogatory term for people from African tribes.

<text>Georgie Torres Dougherty (born September 21, 1957) is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player. He is a well known former BSN basketball player. Torres broke the record for the most points scored in a career in that league, with over 15,800 points scored. He was the first player to reach that number of points. The Puerto Rican professional basketball league only holds 30 to 34 games each year; players who score over 5,000 career points there are usually considered to be among the great Puerto Rican basketball players.

Torres debuted in the BSN in 1975, with the &quot;Cariduros de Fajardo&quot;. Torres became a household name in Puerto Rico while with that team. He led the league in points scored from 1984 to 1987. Despite helping the Cariduros to the playoffs multiple times during his era there, the Cariduros failed to win a championship.

Later on, Torres went on to play with the &quot;Mets de Guaynabo&quot; alongside Mario Morales. After his stay with the Mets, Torres played for the Vaqueros de Bayamon with whom he won his first two championships in 1995 and 1996 and the &quot;Gallitos de Isabela&quot;, before landing with the &quot;Cangrejeros de Santurce&quot;. With the Crabbers, Torres teamed up along with players such as José Ortiz, Carlos Arroyo, Rolando Hourruitiner and Sharif Fajardo to win the league&#x27;s championship in 1999.

Also in 1999, he reached the milestone of 15,500 points.

Torres was a longtime member of the Puerto Rican national basketball team. Due to different reasons, however, the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia were the only Olympic Games he was able to attend.

<text>[[Dah, Ladakh|Dah]] (also known as Dha) and [[Hanoo|Hanu]] are two villages of the Brokpa of the Leh District of the Indian union territory of Ladakh. Until 2010, these were the only two villages where tourists were allowed to visit out of a number of Brokpa villages.

The two villages situated in the Dha Hanu valley, also known as Aryan valley, about 163 km northwest of Leh in Ladakh. Being at a lower altitude, Dha and Hanu is warmer than Leh, allowing for the cultivation of wine-grapes and cherries as well as apricots and walnuts.

The Brokpa people of Dah Hanu are nominally Buddhist but also worship their own animist pantheon of gods. They converted to Buddhism in the mid-nineteenth century. They have an Indo-European appearance in contrast to the predominant Tibeto-Mongol inhabitants of most of Ladakh. According to popular belief, the Brokpas were part of the army of Alexander the Great and came to the region over two thousand years ago

&quot;Some households still practice polyandry...it is the groom who pays the bride price. Women have rights of divorce.&quot;

<doc id="1148195" wikidata="Q922000" url="?curid=1148195" title="Broadacre City">
<text>Broadacre City was an urban or suburban development concept proposed by Frank Lloyd Wright throughout most of his lifetime. He presented the idea in his book &quot;The Disappearing City&quot; in 1932. A few years later he unveiled a very detailed twelve-by-twelve-foot (3.7 × 3.7 m) scale model representing a hypothetical four-square-mile (10 km2) community. The model was crafted by the student interns who worked for him at Taliesin, and financed by
Edgar Kaufmann. It was initially displayed at an Industrial Arts Exposition in the Forum at the Rockefeller Center starting on April 15, 1935. After the New York exposition, Kaufmann arranged to have the model displayed in Pittsburgh at an exposition titled &quot;New Homes for Old&quot;, sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration. The exposition opened on June 18 on the 11th floor of Kaufmann&#x27;s store. The model is now on display at the Museum of Modern Art. Wright went on to refine the concept in later books and in articles until his death in 1959.

Many of the building models in the concept were completely new designs by Wright, while others were refinements of older ones, some of which had rarely been seen.

Broadacre City was the antithesis of a city and the apotheosis of the newly born suburbia, shaped through Wright&#x27;s particular vision. It was both a planning statement and a socio-political scheme, inspired by Henry George, by which each U.S. family would be given a plot of land from the federal lands reserves, and a Wright-conceived community would be built anew from this. In a sense it was the exact opposite of transit-oriented development. There is a train station and a few office and apartment buildings in Broadacre City, but the apartment dwellers are expected to be a small minority. All important transport is done by automobile, and the pedestrian can exist safely only within the confines of the plots where most of the population dwells.

In his book &quot;Urban Planning Theory since 1945&quot;, Nigel Taylor considers the planning methodology of this type of city to be Blueprint planning, which came under heavy criticism in the late 1950s by many critics such as Jane Jacobs, in her 1961 book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;.

==Similar models==
Some of the earlier garden city ideas of the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and the urban planner Ebenezer Howard had much in common with Broadacre City, save for the absence of the automobile, born much later.
More recently, the development of the edge city is like an unplanned, incomplete version of Broadacre city.

The R. W. Lindholm Service Station in Cloquet, Minnesota, shows some of Wright&#x27;s ideas for Broadacre City.

<text>KCB Bank Kenya Limited is a financial services provider headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya. It is licensed as a commercial bank, by the Central Bank of Kenya, the national banking regulator. The bank has also been running Agency banking model.

== Overview ==
As of December 2015, KCB Bank Kenya was the largest commercial bank in Kenya with assets of more than US$3.681 billion (KES:366 billion) and US$2.776 billion (KES:276 billion) in customer deposits. In August 2021, the bank recorded a customer deposit growth to USD$5.47 billion (KES:601.7 billion) and had an asset base value of USD$7.09 billion (KES:7.09 billion).

== History ==
KCB Bank Kenya roots trace back to July 1896 when its parent company, KCB Group, was formed as a branch of the National Bank of India in Mombasa. In 1958, Grindlays Bank merged with the National Bank of India to form the National and Grindlays Bank. Upon independence, the Government of Kenya acquired 60% shareholding in National &amp; Grindlays Bank. In 1970, the Government took full control of the bank and renamed it to Kenya Commercial Bank Group.

KCB Bank Kenya, as it is now known, was incorporated in 2015 as a result of the corporate restructure of Kenya Commercial Bank Group (KCB Group). Prior to 2015, KCB Group was both a licensed bank and a holding company for its subsidiaries. This was in compliance with the Kenya Finance Act No.57 of 2012. KCB Group Limited announced, in April 2015, its intention to incorporate a new wholly owned subsidiary, KCB Bank Kenya Limited, to which it would transfer its Kenyan banking business, assets and liabilities. The re-organisation converted KCB Group Limited into a non-trading holding company that owns both banking and non-banking subsidiary companies.

In 2016, KCB Group PLC was registered as a non-operating holding company to manage and oversee all KCB regional units in Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia. In 2019, KCB Group PLC acquired National Bank of Kenya.

<text>Karlstein am Main (officially &quot;Karlstein a. Main&quot;) is a municipality in the Aschaffenburg district in the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Lower Franconia (&quot;Unterfranken&quot;) in Bavaria, Germany. It is the westernmost settlement in Bavaria. Karlstein&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (constituent villages) are Dettingen and Großwelzheim, the former being notable as the site of the Battle of Dettingen during the War of the Austrian Succession. In the 20th century, the town was the site of the, now decommissioned, Großwelzheim Nuclear Power Plant.

==Geography==

===Location===

Karlstein am Main lies on the River Main, and on the railway between Frankfurt am Main and Aschaffenburg, 16 km northwest of Aschaffenburg.

===Constituent communities===
Karlstein&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are Dettingen and Großwelzheim.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The placename Dettingen suggests an Alamannic settlement (3rd to 14th century), and the placename Großwelzheim a Frankish one.

===First mentions===
Großwelzheim had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey in 772. Then, the village was called &quot;Walinesheim&quot;. The placename has the &quot;—heim&quot; ending that was typical for places founded in Frankish times. The name comes from a count named &quot;Walah&quot; who held sway in the Maingau.

Dettingen had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Emperor Otto II.

===Battle of Dettingen===

During the War of the Austrian Succession a battle took place in the Karlstein area on 27 June 1743, known as the Battle of Dettingen. The so-called &quot;Pragmatic Army&quot;, made up of 35,000 Britons, Hanoverians and Austrians found itself fighting a 23,000 strong French army. The Pragmatic Army overcame the French, thus giving rise to the legend of the &quot;Wandering Englishman&quot;, which has been handed down in Dettingen to this day. The Battle of Dettingen marked the last time a British monarch, King George II, personally led his troops into battle. George Frideric Handel wrote the &quot;Dettingen Te Deum&quot; in honour of the British victory, which was first performed on 27 November 1743 – exactly five months after the battle began – in George II&#x27;s presence.

===Amalgamation===
In the course of municipal reform in Bavaria came the merger of the two communities of Dettingen and Großwelzheim on 1 July 1975. In a vote, the new community&#x27;s citizens decided on the name Karlstein, which had cropped up as early as some time about 1000 in a description of the Aschaffenburg Forest Region, and was also the name given an old community limit stone between Dettingen and Großwelzheim.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Karlstein&quot; supposedly, according to a traditional anecdote, goes back to Charlemagne (who is called &quot;Karl der Große&quot; in German). Charlemagne reportedly often stayed in Seligenstadt, right across the river, and was much given to hunting in the Spessart. To reach there, he would cross the Main in his ship to the place then still known as &quot;Tettingen&quot;. The stone at the landing, or even the limit stone between &quot;Tettingen&quot; and &quot;Walinesheim&quot;, then came to be known as Karlstein.

==Politics==

===Community council===

The council is made up of 20 council members, not counting the mayor.

(as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008)

===Coat of arms===
The community&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Party per fess wavy, azure the Cross of Dettingen argent, argent an atom symbol with three orbits of the first and a nucleus gules.

The wavy parting refers to the community&#x27;s location on the Main, which is also part of the community&#x27;s name. Since the community was formed out of the two former communities of Dettingen and Großwelzheim in 1975, the arms display charges from each former community&#x27;s arms. The uniquely shaped cross above the parting is the so-called Cross of Dettingen (or &quot;Dettinger Kreuz&quot; in German). It comes from Late Gothic times and is found in Saint Hippolytus&#x27;s Church (&quot;Kirche St. Hippolyt&quot;) in the constituent community of Dettingen. The atom symbol below the parting is taken from the arms formerly borne by the community of Großwelzheim. Within community limits, Germany&#x27;s first nuclear power station was built, although it was only experimental. In 1960, it began feeding electricity into the power grid. The reactor was shut down in 1985, and by the end of 2008, it had been fully removed.

The arms have been borne since 13 October 1977.

==Economy==

===Nuclear power stations===
On 13 November 1960, the Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, which despite the name is wholly within Karlstein&#x27;s limits, came into service. The neighbouring community of Kahl am Main merely stood godfather at the christening. On 25 November 1985, after running for 25 years, the power station was shut down. In 1988 the first dismantling work began, ending by late 2008.

The Großwelzheim hot steam reactor was in the same area; it was fully dismantled by 1998.

<text>The Corrective Work Order, commonly known as CWO, is a Singaporean law meted out to &#x27;litterbugs&#x27;, those who are caught littering in a public street. It is one of the two penalties against littering in the country, with the other being a fine.

==Overview==
The order forces the &#x27;litterbugs&#x27; to clean up a specified location as ordered by the government, while wearing a bright green luminous vest bearing the words &quot;Corrective Work Order&quot;. The punishment aims to force the offender to rehabilitate and shame litterbugs in public to deter others from committing the similar offence. It may also be meted out together with a fine.

==Results==
Corrective Work Order was intended for repeat offenders only. Introduced in 1992, it proved to be very successful. Littering offenses significantly dropped, and there were very few repeat offenders. Occasionally, a few who served Corrective Work Order had their faces photographed by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; and published on the front cover. Litterbugs serving Corrective Work Order usually have their faces covered with a mask or plastic bag (which is legal) to avoid being identified by members of the public.

However, media interest long since tailed off, and there is some evidence that the sentence may now be less effective as a deterrent to littering by the general public. Nevertheless, the CWO remains in force.

<doc id="1148228" wikidata="Q1228404" url="?curid=1148228" title="Calamity Jane (1953 film)">
<text>Calamity Jane is a 1953 American Technicolor Western musical film starring Doris Day and Howard Keel, and directed by David Butler. The musical numbers were staged and directed by Jack Donohue, who a year later would direct the Day musical &quot;Lucky Me&quot; (1954). The film is loosely based on the life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane (Doris Day) and explores an alleged romance between her and Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel).

&quot;Calamity Jane&quot; was devised by Warner Bros. in response to the success of the 1950 film &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Secret Love&quot; (Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster), and was also Oscar-nominated for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Ray Heindorf) and Best Sound, Recording (William A. Mueller).

The songs and screenplay would form the basis of a 1961 stage musical of the same name that has had a number of productions.

==Plot==

Dakota Territory, the 1870s. Tough-talking, hard-riding, straight-shooting Calamity Jane (Doris Day) has a crush on Second Lieutenant Gilmartin (Philip Carey). She even risks life and limb to single-handedly save him from an Indian war party. Meanwhile, Deadwood&#x27;s saloon owner, who sends for beautiful women entertainers to appear on stage, mistakenly hires a male. Fearing a riot, the owner persuades the reluctant actor to perform in drag. Initially convincing, his wig falls off, and the angry audience threatens to tear the saloon down. But Calamity calms the situation, vowing to go to Chicago and bring the renowned singer Adelaid Adams (Gale Robbins) back to Deadwood. However, her friend Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel) expresses doubt, even scoffing at the idea. Calamity arrives in Chicago, where Adams is giving her farewell performance before launching a European tour. After the show ends, Adelaid gives her old costumes to her maid, Katie Brown (Allyn McLerie), who dreams of becoming a singer. Later, when Calamity walks in, she mistakes Katie for Adelaid. Katie, posing as Adelaid Adams, agrees to go with Calamity, seeing it as a chance to perform on stage. But back in Deadwood, during Katie&#x27;s premiere performance, stage fright gets the best of her. She bursts into tears, admitting she is not Adelaid Adams. As the stunned crowd are on the verge of rioting, Calamity fires a shot in the air and defends Katie. She is allowed to carry on, and her confidence wins them over.

Katie moves into Calamity&#x27;s ramshackle cabin which they fix up together. To attract Lt. Gilmartin, Calamity, with Katie&#x27;s help, dresses and behaves &quot;ladylike&quot;. But Gilmartin and Hickok both admire Katie. At one point, they draw straws to see who will take her to the upcoming ball. Lt. Gilmartin wins, and Wild Bill agrees to complement the double date by escorting Calamity. At the ball, everyone is awed by Calamity&#x27;s transformation. She&#x27;s beautiful. But she becomes increasingly jealous watching Katie and Gilmartin together. The ball ends when Calamity angrily confronts Katie, shooting a punch glass from her hand. A day later, though, Katie returns the favor at the saloon. Calamity, feeling humiliated, exits with Wild Bill and they drive off in his wagon. A heartbroken Calamity reveals her crush on Gilmartin, while Bill admits his love for Katie. Yet the scene is resolved when she and Bill passionately embrace and kiss. Calamity then realizes she loved Wild Bill all along. The next day, Katie returns to Chicago, feeling guilty over betraying her best friend. A furious Lt. Gilmartin blames Calamity for Katie leaving. She responds by mounting her horse and riding out to overtake the stagecoach. There, she tells Katie she loves Wild Bill, and the two women are reunited. The story ends with a double wedding.

==Subtext==

The film has been popular with some lesbian audiences for its depiction of a character which can be read as lesbian, and was screened at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 2006, 53 years after its original production and release. Film critic Jamie Stuart points to the film&#x27;s lesbian overtones in Jane being played as a strong, independent woman who shares a house with a woman, the two of them painting &quot;Calam and Katie&quot; on its door. Armond White sees the film as approaching sexuality in a way that Hollywood was not openly able to do, describing the empathy and envy (despite this resulting from conflict over a man) between Jane and Katie&#x27;s characters as &quot;a landmark display of girl-on-girl attraction.&quot; &quot;Out&quot; magazine described the film&#x27;s award-winning song, &quot;Secret Love,&quot; as &quot;the first gay anthem.&quot; When asked about her award winning song being embraced by the gay community during a 2011 interview with &quot;The Advocate (magazine)&quot;, 58 years after the movie&#x27;s release, star actress Doris Day (1922-2019), in long retirement when told about the unique significance that the film enjoyed in its subsequent decades of showings and popularity, (at her age 89, and eight years before her own passing), replied, &quot;I was not aware of that, but that&#x27;s wonderful.&quot;

==Accuracy==
Though the musicale Western film portrays the famous Calamity Jane (born Martha Jane Canary, 1852-1903), and &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok (born James Butler Hickok, 1837-1876), as lovers, historians have found no proof that they were more than acquaintances. There was a 15-year age difference between them. Jane claimed years after Hickok&#x27;s 1876 shooting death that she had not only been his lover but also his wife and the mother of his child, but she offered no substantiation of her claims. Many of her contemporaries considered her a teller of tall tales (as portrayed in the film to humorous effect) who exaggerated her links to more famous frontier figures, and some insisted Hickok did not even particularly like her. But when she died 27 years later at the relatively young age of 51 in 1903, decades after Hickok, who was shot at age 39 in 1876, friends buried her beside him at her request; four of the men on the self-appointed committee who planned Calamity&#x27;s funeral in 1903 (Albert Malter, Frank Ankeney, Jim Carson, and Anson Higby) later stated that, since Hickok had &quot;absolutely no use&quot; for Jane in this life, they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by laying her, as she requested, to rest by his side.

<text>The Kasba Ganapati refers to both a particular murti of the god Ganapati in Pune, India, as well as to the temple built around the murti. The Kasba Ganapati is the presiding deity (gramadevata) of Pune.
Kasba Ganpati is considered the first Manacha Ganpati, or most revered Ganpati, in Pune, Maharashtra. The idol was established in 1893 and is located in the Kasba Peth area of Pune, an ancient part of the city. It is patronized by Ganapati Bapurao Bebhan Durbar and is considered the presiding deity of Pune. The idol is said to be self-made and was originally the size of a grain of rice, but is now larger due to a layer of red sandalwood.

==History==
The temple was commissioned by Jijausaheb, after Dadoji Konddeo reported to her that a murti of Ganpati had been found in Pune. The murti&#x27;s status as the premier murti in Pune was decided by Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

In the year 1630, the Maratha Aristocrat and wife of Sardar Shahaji Bhosale, Jijaubaisaheb Bhosale arrived in Pune with her then infant son, Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj, the founder of Maratha Empire. Around this time, along with other seven families, the Thakar Family migrated to Pune from the village of Indi, Bijapur district in present-day state of Karnataka. Shri Vinayak Bhatt Thakar also carried his Family deity, Lord Gajanan along with him. All these families settled near River bank around the current place of Kasba Ganapati Temple which was close to the residence of Jijabai. Jijabai perceived this as an auspicious moment and promptly decided to build a temple, which is popularly known as the Kasba Ganpati Mandir.

Since then, Pune is also known as the city of Ganesh. The Peshwas were ardent followers of Lord Ganesh. During their regime Shaniwarwada witnessed grand celebrations for Lord Ganesh.

In 1893, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the Indian Nationalist Leader, initiated the now famous Ganesh Festival. His intention was to gather people sharing similar ideas and exchange thoughts to deal with the British ruler. He started celebrating Ganesh Festival from his own house called Kesari Wada. Due to his personal popularity and initiative, Ganesh Festival became a public festival soon afterwards.

There was rivalry among the various mandals regarding the privilege of immersing the murti first on the last day of the Ganpati festival. Bal Gangadhar Tilak resolved the rivalry and declared the privilege of first immersion to Shri Kasba Ganpati, as it is the local deity of Pune.

==Annual Ganesh Festival==
Until 1925, Shri Kasba Ganpati Mandal celebrated the festival within the premises of the temple and from 1926 it has been celebrated in an enclosed mandap. Presently, the ten days of the festival is a platform for local artists to display their talents through various cultural programs thus allowing a large number of devotees to participate in the celebrations. On the last day, Shri Kasba Ganpati plays the leading role during the immersion procession.

<text>Mustafa Erkin Koray (; 24 June 1941 – 7 August 2023) was a Turkish singer and guitarist who mainly played Anatolian rock.

==Life and career==
Koray was active in the Turkish rock music scene since the late 1950s. In 1967, he released his first single, &quot;Anma Arkadaş&quot;.

In the early 1970s, he formed the group Ter with former members of the band Bunalım. They only recorded one single, &quot;Hor Görme Garibi&quot;, before breaking up. In 1973, his first solo album, &quot;Erkin Koray&quot;, was issued. He left Istanbul Records after the release, and in 1974, signed with Doglan Records, which released his &quot;dabke&quot; single &quot;Şaşkın&quot;.

Koray, alongside Orhan Gencebay, were the inventors of the electro baglama, the electric version of a traditional Turkish musical instrument related to the lute.

Koray died on 7 August 2023, at the age of 82, in Toronto, Canada, from lung disease.

<doc id="1148264" wikidata="Q1073261" url="?curid=1148264" title="China Crisis">
<text>China Crisis are an English new wave and synth-pop band formed in Kirkby, near Liverpool, Merseyside in 1979 with a core of lead vocalist/keyboardist Gary Daly and guitarist/vocalist Eddie Lundon. Initially a politically charged post-punk band influenced by Brian Eno&#x27;s ambient soundscapes, China Crisis soon crossed over to a more commercial sound and had success in the United Kingdom in the 1980s with ten top-50 singles, including the top-10 hit &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;, and three albums charting in or just outside the top 20, including &quot;Working with Fire and Steel&quot; and the top-10 entry &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot;, that both received a gold certification.

== History ==

=== Early years and influences ===
Gary Daly (born 5 May 1962, Kirkby, Knowsley, Merseyside) and Eddie Lundon (born 9 June 1962, Kirkby, Knowsley, Merseyside) grew up in working-class families in Kirkby and met at the Roman Catholic St Kevin&#x27;s School for Boys. Sharing an affection for Steely Dan, David Bowie and Brian Eno, they started playing together in their teens with Lundon on guitar and Daly on bass guitar. They then played with various Knowsley post-punk groups including different lineups of the band the Glass Torpedoes before Daly and Lundon continued on their own. Around 1980 they obtained a synthesizer and a drum machine and began writing songs; Eno&#x27;s ambient soundscapes were influential on the group&#x27;s musical trajectory, as were synth-pop acts like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and Depeche Mode. Initially, Daly and Lundon shared synthesizer duties on the group&#x27;s albums, but Daly began taking on the lion&#x27;s share of synthesizer/keyboard parts as the group&#x27;s popularity continued to rise.

Daly also cites Talking Heads and post-punk band Magazine as early influences. Eventually joined by drummer and percussionist Dave Reilly, they released their debut single &quot;African and White&quot; as China Crisis on the independent record label Inevitable in 1981. Initially the band&#x27;s main interest was in studio recording, but they also performed a few live gigs. On 31 December 1981, they performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London along with Haircut One Hundred. In March 1982, they recorded a four-song Peel session for the BBC. In April–May 1982, they played their first UK tour. In June 1982, they backed Tom Verlaine of Television at The Venue in London. In September they performed at the Futurama 4 Festival, followed by a late 1982 UK tour.

=== First successes ===
The band signed a recording contract with Virgin Records in April 1982, and released a single, &quot;Scream Down at Me&quot;, in May. A Virgin re-release of &quot;African and White&quot; was their first success, reaching No. 45 in the UK Singles Chart in August, followed by the less successful &quot;No More Blue Horizons (Fool, Fool, Fool)&quot; in October. Recorded over a long period of time with different producers, they released their debut studio album, &quot;Difficult Shapes &amp; Passive Rhythms, Some People Think It&#x27;s Fun to Entertain&quot; in November 1982. From it, the single &quot;Christian&quot;, made UK No. 12 in early 1983 and brought them to national prominence. By the time of this success, Reilly had left the band, but had remained with the band long enough to co-write and perform on &quot;Christian&quot;, along with session musician Steve Levy playing oboe and saxophone. The album peaked at No. 21 in the UK Albums Chart. During this period the band toured supporting Simple Minds on their &quot;New Gold Dream&quot; tour augmented by bass guitarist Gary &quot;Gazza&quot; Johnson and Steve Levy.

=== &quot;Working with Fire and Steel – Possible Pop Songs Volume Two&quot; ===
Again augmented by Gary Johnson (bass guitar), Steve Levy (oboe), and Waterboys drummer Kevin Wilkinson, in January 1983 the band premiered three new songs, including &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;, in a BBC Peel session. Adding Johnson and Levy as full members of the line-up, China Crisis recorded a second studio album in Liverpool and at The Manor Studio, Oxfordshire with producer Mike Howlett and Kevin Wilkinson on drums. In May, the single &quot;Tragedy and Mystery&quot; was released and peaked at number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. The arrangement of the song with prominent use of Levy&#x27;s oboe and flugel horn marked a noticeable change from the band&#x27;s previous synth-pop sound.
Preceded by the title track &quot;Working with Fire and Steel&quot;, which reached number 48 in the UK, and was a hit on the US Dance Club Songs chart at number 27, the album entitled &quot;Working with Fire and Steel – Possible Pop Songs Volume Two&quot;, was released in October 1983. The arrival of Steve Levy and drummer Kevin Wilkinson into the band&#x27;s line-up, along with the introduction of more session musicians, gave the album a markedly less synthetic sound than its predecessor. While the band made use of the then latest technology such as the emulator, they notably incorporated brass, woodwind and string instruments to their sound.

In early 1984, the single &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot; peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, making it their first and only UK top 10 hit single. The song was also a top 10 hit in Ireland, a top 20 hit in several European countries and hit number one on the Swedish radio chart &quot;Poporama&quot;. In March 1984, the follow-up single &quot;Hanna Hanna&quot; reached number 44 on the UK singles chart.

The album itself was a top 20 success in the UK, also reaching the top 40 in several other countries (including Spain, Australia, Canada, etc.), and China Crisis spent 1984 and 1985 making their biggest chart run. In spring 1984, China Crisis toured Europe on their Working with Fire Steel Tour, followed by touring Europe and North America supporting Simple Minds.

=== &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot; and mainstream success ===
Their third studio album, &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot;, was produced by Walter Becker of Steely Dan fame and reached No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart in May 1985. China Crisis was so honoured to directly work with Becker that they officially listed him in the group as a quintet consisting of Daly, Lundon, Johnson, Wilkinson, and Becker on the album&#x27;s credits. He never formally appeared with the band (but made important playing contributions on the album) or the subsequent tour featuring new keyboardist Brian McNeill. Johnson was now credited as co-writer with Daly and Lundon.

The album was promoted by the No. 14 UK hit single &quot;Black Man Ray&quot;, which also enjoyed critical acclaim and international success, reaching the top 40 in Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Netherlands, etc. The follow-up, &quot;King in a Catholic Style&quot;, was a top 20 UK single at No. 19, but it would prove to be the band&#x27;s last substantial hit. A third release from the album, &quot;You Did Cut Me&quot;, stalled at UK No. 54 but reached the top 30 in Ireland and top 10 in Spain. Following their mainstream success, in June 1985 Daly and Lundon fronted the cover of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine.

The album was followed by a spring 1985 UK tour, performance at the Netherlands Pinkpop Festival in May, six dates in the US and Canada in July–August and further UK dates in October 1985. They also released a video compilation, &quot;Showbiz Absurd&quot;.

=== &quot;What Price Paradise&quot; ===
In 1986, the band collaborated with producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley (known for their work with Madness) on &quot;What Price Paradise&quot;, which included &quot;Arizona Sky&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single release and another Australian hit. In addition, &quot;Arizona Sky&quot; achieved stateside success, giving the group a top 40 hit on the US Adult Contemporary chart. All of the band members were now credited as songwriters. A second single from the album, &quot;Best Kept Secret&quot;, made UK No. 36 in early 1987. It was to be the band&#x27;s final top 40 hit single.

The album was followed by China Crisis touring UK and North America in 1987. In summer 1987, they performed at the German Rock am Ring festival, at Stockholm Olympic Stadium, and at the Leysin Festival in Switzerland.

=== &quot;Diary of a Hollow Horse&quot; ===
The five-piece band worked with Becker once more on 1989&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Hollow Horse&quot;, which earned critical acclaim though little commercial success. It fared slightly better than its predecessor, making the UK top 60, and spawned the singles &quot;St. Saviour Square&quot; and &quot;Red Letter Day&quot;, both achieving the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart. Becker produced most of the album&#x27;s tracks, but this time was not credited as an official band member.

The album was followed by a May–June UK tour, which was the last performances of the five-piece band and the last China Crisis concerts for over five years.

=== &quot;Warped by Success&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Warped by Success&quot;, was released in 1994, following the band&#x27;s parting of ways with Virgin Records. The album produced their final studio chart single, &quot;Everyday the Same&quot;, which briefly edged into the UK top 100. The band was now once again a duo of Daly and Lundon, although Johnson and Wilkinson were both amongst the session musicians employed in the recording of the album. In 1995, they released a live unplugged album and video entitled &quot;Acoustically Yours&quot;. This featured a live version of &quot;Black Man Ray&quot;, and also saw a brief return for Johnson, McNeill, and Wilkinson.

Since 1992, there have been four compilation albums of their work for the UK and US markets and three live DVDs. The first of these, entitled &quot;Collection: The Very Best of China Crisis&quot;, made the top 40 on the UK Albums Chart in 1990.

=== 1995–2014: Interim years and reduced activity ===

Since the late 1990s, China Crisis has concentrated on live performances with only original members Eddie Lundon and Gary Daly being constant throughout; the band alternates between performances either as a duo or with a fluctuating line-up of backing musicians.

On 17 July 1999, drummer Kevin Wilkinson died by suicide, hanging himself at the age of 41. Wilkinson had played with a wide variety of other artists including the Waterboys, Fish, the Proclaimers, Squeeze and with Howard Jones. In 2000, Daly contributed a track to a tribute compilation album to Wilkinson, &quot;Green Indians&quot;.

In December 2002, China Crisis&#x27; Daly and Lundon held a one-night unplugged venue in Manila, Philippines, with the support of a local alternative rock band, Rivermaya. They toured the UK during January and February 2007 as part of their 25th anniversary. Daly released his limited edition solo studio album, &quot;The Visionary Mindset Experience&quot;, in 2007, featuring collaborations with Megan Kovacs of the band Kovacs and Jean Weir. 

In 2008, they were the support act for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s UK October tour. The following year, the band performed a fund raising gig for The Friends of Meols Park, played at Fort Perch Rock on the Wirral, the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames, and the Mathew Street Festival at Sefton Park in Liverpool.

They returned to the Philippines to perform at Eastwood City in Quezon City on 20 January 2011 and played at the Rewind Festivals in Perth, Scotland and Henley-on-Thames in August 2011. Another concert in the Philippines was held on 9 September 2011 at the SMX Convention Center Manila in Pasay, together with Ex-Simple Minds with further shows in the Philippines, Singapore and Hong Kong that followed. China Crisis&#x27; two lead musicians were joined by Siân Monaghan on drums.

Subsequently, the band toured extensively playing dates in the UK (including regular gigs at the Cavern Club, Liverpool) as well as visiting the United States and Canada, and returning to the Philippines.

=== &quot;Autumn in the Neighbourhood&quot; ===

On 16 December 2013, the song &quot;Everyone You Know&quot; was made available as a free download on the PledgeMusic website, when pre-ordering the band&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Autumn in the Neighbourhood&quot; announced for release in 2014. On 13 January 2014, the band posted an illustrated account of the track and how it was written and came to be recorded. 87% of the pledge goal had been reached at that time. Ahead of the release of the new album, the track &quot;Being in Love&quot; was premiered on Steve Lamacq&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 Music show on 25 April 2014. The band toured in late 2014, playing some tracks from the new album alongside older favourites. As of 5 February 2015, the band had achieved 235% of its Pledgemusic target and the album was in final mix and production.

&quot;Autumn in the Neighbourhood&quot; was released on 3 June 2015 via the PledgeMusic website. It was their first studio album for 21 years, and contained 11 songs; however, the pre-release taster track, &quot;Everyone You Know&quot;, was not included on the album. The band undertook an extensive promotional tour of the UK from the end of September until December 2015, both as a trio and as a full band. The tour included a special &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection Live&quot; night at the Epstein Theatre, Liverpool on 17 October 2015 to mark the thirtieth anniversary of their 1985 studio album of that name. The band also played five nights in North America in December under the banner of &quot;North America Merry Christmas Tour&quot;.

In November 2015, a compilation album, &quot;80s Recovered&quot;, featuring many 1980s-related artists was released on the Music Brokers label. China Crisis contributed a cover version of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, with both a regular version and an extended remix.

=== 2017–present: Later years ===

In March 2017, China Crisis performed as part of an &quot;80s Invasion Tour&quot; that included Toyah, Paul Young and Martika.

In July 2017, the band returned to the Philippines for a show at the Kia Theatre, alongside Peter Coyle of fellow Liverpool band the Lotus Eaters.

Former China Crisis producer and member Walter Becker died on 3 September 2017, at the age of 67.

While China Crisis continue to tour the UK and play live dates, founder member Eddie Lundon teaches songwriting at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Lead vocalist Gary Daly released his solo debut studio album &quot;Gone from Here&quot; in May 2019. Former China Crisis bassist Gary &quot;Gazza&quot; Johnson and keyboardist Brian McNeill both play on the album. In February 2020, Daly released the solo studio album &quot;Luna Landings&quot;, a collection of instrumental recordings written between 1981 and 1987.

In 2020, China Crisis were the opening act for Kim Wilde on her Greatest Hits Tour, and they embarked on their own 40th anniversary headlining tour in 2022.

<text>Exponential backoff is an algorithm that uses feedback to multiplicatively decrease the rate of some process, in order to gradually find an acceptable rate. These algorithms find usage in a wide range of systems and processes, with radio networks and computer networks being particularly notable.

==Exponential backoff algorithm==
An exponential backoff algorithm is a form of closed-loop control system that reduces the rate of a controlled process in response to adverse events. For example, if a smartphone app fails to connect to its server, it might try again 1 second later, then if it fails again, 2 seconds later, then 4, etc. Each time the pause is multiplied by a fixed amount (in this case 2). In this case, the adverse event is failing to connect to the server. Other examples of adverse events include collisions of network traffic, an error response from a service, or an explicit request to reduce the rate (i.e. &quot;back off&quot;).

The rate reduction can be modelled as an exponential function:

:formula_1

or

:formula_2

Here, is the time delay applied between actions, is the multiplicative factor or &quot;base&quot;, is the number of adverse events observed, and is the frequency (or rate) of the process (i.e. number of actions per unit of time). The value of is incremented each time an adverse event is observed, leading to an exponential rise in delay and, therefore, an inversely proportionate rate. An exponential backoff algorithm where is referred to as a &quot;binary&quot; exponential backoff algorithm.

When the rate has been reduced in response to an adverse event, it usually does not remain at that reduced level forever. If no adverse events are observed for some period of time, often referred to as the &quot;recovery time&quot; or &quot;cooling-off period&quot;, the rate may be increased again. The time period that must elapse before attempting to increase the rate again may, itself, be determined by an exponential backoff algorithm. Typically, recovery of the rate occurs more slowly than reduction of the rate due to backoff and often requires careful tuning to avoid oscillation of the rate. The exact recovery behaviour is implementation-specific and may be informed by any number of environmental factors.

The mechanism by which rate reduction is practically achieved in a system may be more complex than a simple time delay. In some cases, the value may refer to an upper bound to the time delay, rather than a specific time delay value. The name &quot;exponential backoff&quot; refers to the exponential growth characteristic of the backoff, rather than an exact numeric relationship between adverse event counts and delay times.

==Rate limiting==
Exponential backoff is commonly utilised as part of rate limiting mechanisms in computer systems such as web services, to help enforce fair distribution of access to resources and prevent network congestion. Each time a service informs a client that it is sending requests too frequently, the client reduces its rate by some predetermined factor, until the client&#x27;s request rate reaches an acceptable equilibrium. The service may enforce rate limiting by refusing to respond to requests when the client is sending them too frequently so that misbehaving clients are not allowed to exceed their allotted resources.

A benefit of utilising an exponential backoff algorithm, over of a fixed rate limit, is that rate limits can be achieved dynamically without providing any prior information to the client. In the event that resources are unexpectedly constrained, e.g. due to heavy load or a service disruption, backoff requests and error responses from the service can automatically decrease the request rate from clients. This can help maintain some level of availability rather than overloading the service. In addition, quality of service can be prioritised to certain clients based on their individual importance, e.g. by reducing the backoff for emergency calls on a telephone network during periods of high load.

In a simple version of the algorithm, messages are delayed by predetermined (non-random) time. For example, in SIP protocol over unreliable transport (such as UDP) the client retransmits requests at an interval that starts at T1 seconds (usually, , which is the estimate of the round-trip time) and doubles after every retransmission until it reaches T2 seconds (which defaults to ). This results in retransmission intervals of , , , , , , etc.

==Collision avoidance==
Exponential backoff algorithms can be used to avoid network collisions. In a point-to-multipoint or multiplexed network, multiple senders communicate over a single shared channel. If two senders attempt to transmit a message at the same time, or &quot;talk over&quot; each other, a collision occurs and the messages are damaged or lost. Each sender can then back off before attempting to retransmit the same message again.

A deterministic exponential backoff algorithm is unsuitable for this use case since each sender would back off for the same time period, leading them to retransmit simultaneously and cause another collision. Instead, for purposes of collision avoidance, the time between retransmissions is randomized and the exponential backoff algorithm sets the &quot;range&quot; of delay values that are possible. The time delay is usually measured in slots, which are fixed-length periods (or &quot;slices&quot;) of time on the network. In a binary exponential backoff algorithm (i.e. one where ), after collisions, each retransmission is delayed by a random number of slot times between and . After the first collision, each sender will wait 0 or 1 slot times. After the second collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 3 slot times (inclusive). After the third collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 7 slot times (inclusive), and so forth. As the number of retransmission attempts increases, the number of possibilities for delay increases exponentially. This decreases the probability of a collision but increases the average latency.

Exponential backoff is utilised during retransmission of frames in carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) networks, where this algorithm is part of the channel access method used to send data on these networks. In Ethernet networks, the algorithm is commonly used to schedule retransmissions after collisions. The retransmission is delayed by an amount of time derived from the slot time (for example, the time it takes to send 512 bits; i.e., 512 bit-times) and the number of attempts to retransmit.

===Example===
This example is from the Ethernet protocol, where a sending host is able to know when a collision has occurred (that is, another host has tried to transmit), when it is sending a frame. If both hosts attempted to re-transmit as soon as a collision occurred, there would be yet another collision — and the pattern would continue forever. The hosts must choose a random value within an acceptable range to ensure that this situation doesn&#x27;t happen. An exponential backoff algorithm is therefore used. The value 51.2 μs is used as an example here because it is the slot time for a Ethernet line. However, could be replaced by any positive value, in practice.

# When a collision first occurs, send a &quot;jamming signal&quot; to prevent further data from being sent.
# Resend a frame after either 0 seconds or , chosen at random.
# If that fails, resend the frame after either , , , or .
# If that still fails, resend the frame after · , where is a random integer between 0 and .
# For further failures, after the &quot;c&quot;th failed attempt, resend the frame after · , where is a random integer between 0 and .

==History and theory==
In a seminal paper published in AFIPS 1970, Norman Abramson presented the idea of multiple “users,” on different islands, sharing a single radio channel (i.e., a single frequency) to access the main computer at the University of Hawaii without any time synchronization. Packet collisions at the receiver of the main computer are treated by senders after a timeout as detected errors. Each sender not receiving a positive acknowledgement from the main computer would retransmit its “lost” packet. Abramson assumed that the sequence of packets transmitted into the shared channel is a Poisson process at rate , which is the sum of the rate of new packet arrivals to senders and the rate of retransmitted packets into the channel. Assuming steady state, he showed that the channel throughput rate is formula_3 with a maximum value of 1/(2) = 0.184 in theory.

Larry Roberts considered a time-slotted ALOHA channel with each time slot long enough for a packet transmission time. (A satellite channel using the TDMA protocol is time slotted.) Using the same Poisson process and steady state assumptions as Abramson, Larry Roberts showed that the maximum throughput rate is 1/ = 0.368 in theory. Roberts was the program manager of the ARPANET research project. Inspired by the slotted ALOHA idea, Roberts initiated a new ARPANET Satellite System (ASS) project to include satellite links in the ARPANET.

Simulation results by Abramson, his colleagues, and others showed that an ALOHA channel, slotted or not, is unstable and would sometimes go into congestion collapse. How much time until congestion collapse depended on the arrival rate of new packets as well other unknown factors. In 1971, Larry Roberts asked Professor Leonard Kleinrock and his Ph.D. student, Simon Lam, at UCLA to join the Satellite System project of ARPANET. Simon Lam would work on the stability, performance evaluation, and adaptive control of slotted ALOHA for his Ph.D. dissertation research. The first paper he co-authored with Kleinrock was ARPANET Satellite System (ASS) Note 12 disseminated to the ASS group in August 1972. In this paper, a slot chosen randomly over an interval of slots was used for retransmission. A new result from the model is that increasing increases channel throughput which converges to 1/ as increases to infinity. This model retained the assumptions of Poisson arrivals and steady state and was not intended for understanding statistical behaviour and congestion collapse.

===Stability and adaptive backoff===

To understand stability, Lam created a discrete-time Markov chain model for analyzing the statistical behaviour of slotted ALOHA in chapter 5 of his dissertation. The model has three parameters: , , and . is the total number of users. At any time, each user may be idle or blocked. Each user has at most one packet to transmit in the next time slot. An idle user generates a new packet with probability and transmits it in the next time slot immediately. A blocked user transmits its backlogged packet with probability , where 1/ = (+1)/2 to keep the average retransmission interval the same. The throughput-delay results of the two retransmission methods were compared by extensive simulations and found to be essentially the same.

Lam’s model provides mathematically rigorous answers to the stability questions of slotted ALOHA, as well as an efficient algorithm for computing the throughput-delay performance for any stable system. There are 3 key results, shown below, from Lam’s Markov chain model in Chapter 5 of his dissertation (also published jointly with Professor Len Kleinrock, in IEEE Transactions on Communications.)
# Slotted ALOHA with Poisson arrivals (i.e., infinite ) is inherently unstable, because a stationary probability distribution does not exist. (Reaching steady state was a key assumption used in the models of Abramson and Roberts.)
# For slotted ALOHA with a finite and a finite , the Markov chain model can be used to determine whether the system is stable or unstable for a given input rate (×) and, if it is stable, compute its average packet delay and channel throughput rate. 
# Increasing increases the maximum number of users that can be accommodated by a stable slotted ALOHA channel.
====Corollary====
For a finite (), an unstable channel for the current value can be made stable by increasing to a sufficiently large value, to be referred to as its (,).

===Heuristic RCP for adaptive backoff===
Lam used Markov decision theory and developed optimal control policies for slotted ALOHA but these policies require all blocked users to know the current state (number of blocked users) of the Markov chain. In 1973, Lam decided that instead of using a complex protocol for users to estimate the system state, he would create a simple algorithm for each user to use its own local information, i.e., the number of collisions its backlogged packet has encountered. Applying the above Corollary, Lam invented the following class of adaptive backoff algorithms (named Heuristic RCP).

A Heuristic RCP algorithm consists of the following steps: (1) Let denote the number of previous collisions incurred by a packet at a user as the feedback information in its control loop. For a new packet, (0) is initialized to 1. (2) The packet’s retransmission interval () increases as increases (until the channel becomes stable as implied by the above Corollary). For implementation, with (0)=1, as m increases, () can be increased by multiplication (or by addition).

====Observation====
Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) used in Ethernet several years later is a special case of Heuristic RCP with formula_4.

BEB is very easy to implement. It is however not optimal for many applications because BEB uses 2 as the only multiplier which provides no flexibility for optimization. In particular, for a system with a large number of users, BEB increases () too slowly. On the other hand, for a system with a small number of users, a fairly small is sufficient for the system to be stable, and backoff would not be necessary.
To illustrate an example of a multiplicative RCP that uses several multipliers, see the bottom row in Table 6.3 on page 214 in Chapter 6 of Lam’s dissertation, or bottom row in Table III on page 902 in the Lam-Kleinrock paper. In this example:
# A new packet is transmitted immediately, =0, (0)=1
# For a packet with 1 previous collision, (1) = (0)10 = 10 (The multiplier jumps up directly to = 10 which was found to be the optimum value at steady state for this particular system (slotted ALOHA for a satellite channel).
# For a packet with 2 previous collisions, (2) = (1)10 = 100 (one more collision, jumps up 10 times).
# (3) = (2) × 2 = 200 
# ()=(−1) for ≥4
For this example, =200 is sufficient for a stable slotted ALOHA system with equal to about 400, which follows from result 3 above Corollary. There is no need to increase any further.

==Truncated exponential backoff==
The &#x27;truncated&#x27; variant of the algorithm introduces a limit on . This simply means that after a certain number of increases, the exponentiation stops. Without a limit on , the delay between transmissions may become undesirably long if a sender repeatedly observes adverse events, e.g. due to a degradation in network service. In a randomized system this may occur by chance, leading to unpredictable latency; longer delays due to unbounded increases in are exponentially less probable, but they are effectively inevitable on a busy network due to the law of truly large numbers. Limiting helps to reduce the possibility of unexpectedly long transmission latencies and improve recovery times after a transient outage.

For example, if the ceiling is set at in a truncated binary exponential backoff algorithm, (as it is in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard), then the maximum delay is 1023 slot times, i.e. .

Selecting an appropriate backoff limit for a system involves striking a balance between collision probability and latency. By increasing the ceiling there is an exponential reduction in probability of collision on each transmission attempt. At the same time, increasing the limit also exponentially increases the range of possible latency times for a transmission, leading to less deterministic performance and an increase in the average latency. The optimal limit value for a system is specific to both the implementation and environment.

==Expected backoff==
Given a uniform distribution of backoff times, the expected backoff time is the mean of the possibilities. After &quot;c&quot; collisions in a binary exponential backoff algorithm, the delay is randomly chosen from slots, where , and the expected backoff time (in slots) is
:formula_5

For example, the expected backoff time for the third () collision, one could first calculate the maximum backoff time, &quot;N&quot;:
:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8
and then calculate the mean of the backoff time possibilities:
:formula_9.
which is, for the example, slots.

<text>Abdul Majeed (Dhivehi: އަލްއަމީރު އަބްދުލްމަޖީދު ރައްނަބަނޑޭރި ކިލެގެފާނު) (or Al Ameeru Abdul Majeed Rannabandeyri Kilegefaanu) (29 August 1873 – 21 February 1952) served as Sultan of the Maldives from 1944 to 1952. At the time, the Maldives were a British protectorate. Didi is recognized a reformer and has been described as &quot;the father of the modern Maldives&quot;.

He was fluent in Dhivehi, Urdu, English, Arabic and Sinhalese. Didi spent most of his life in Egypt. He served as the Vice Prime Minister during his father&#x27;s time. He served as the Prime Minister of Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III from 1926 to 1932. During his own reign, his son Prince Hassan Fareed Didi exerted significant control over the government through the Executive Council. After his death, the Maldives proclaimed its first short lived republican government under the pro-socialist president Muhammad Amin Didi. He also designed the flag of Maldives.

Sultan Majeed Didi died on 21 February 1952 in Ceylon. The first Maldivian school, Majeediyya School, was named after him.
