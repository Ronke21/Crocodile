==History==

===Formation and early years (1990–1994)===
Unwritten Law was formed in Poway, California by Wade Youman back in the mid 1980s when he was twelve years old. The band&#x27;s first lineup was Youman on drums, Chris Mussey on vocals, Matt Rathje on guitar, and Craig Winters on bass, Youman described the early incarnations of the group as &quot;kind of Punk, Clashy, and Bauhausy&quot;, A number of players came and went throughout the early years, by 1992 the lineup coalesced to include Youman, Rob Brewer on guitar, Jeff Brehm on bass, and vocalist Scott Russo, who joined the band after doing an impromptu performance of Fugazi&#x27;s Waiting Room at a house party. They released their first cassette demo on September 9, 1992, known as Six Song Demo. The lineup changed when Brehm left and was replaced by John Bell, with this lineup the band recorded and released the 7&quot; vinyl single &quot;Blurr&quot; in 1993, which was released by local label Red Eye Records, Steve Morris was then recruited on second guitar, Unwritten Law quickly established themselves in the prolific San Diego music scene of the early 1990s that also included groups such as Blink-182, Agent 51, Buck-O-Nine, Sprung Monkey, One by One, Drive Like Jehu, and Rocket from the Crypt.

In 1994 the band recorded their first album, &quot;Blue Room&quot;, which established their early sound of fast-paced punk rock and gave them the opportunity to build their reputation by playing local shows in and around the San Diego area. Songs such as &quot;CPK,&quot; &quot;Shallow,&quot; and &quot;Suzanne&quot; would become favorites with local fans and would remain in their live set for years to come.

===Major label signing, Oz Factor (1995–1996)===
&quot;Blue Room&quot; attracted the attention of major labels, the band, having distribution problems, left Red Eye Records and signed a recording contract with Epic Records. Their second album, &quot;Oz Factor&quot; was released in 1996. The songs &quot;Denied&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; received airplay on several southern California rock radio stations and were released as singles. Over the next year the band toured the United States with bands such as Blink-182 and Pennywise.

===Interscope Records, Self-Titled Album (1997–1999)===
By the summer of 1997 bassist John Bell had left the band. Pivit bassist Micah Albao joined them in Seattle for the recording of their next album. Pat &quot;PK&quot; Kim, formerly of Sprung Monkey, would join as their new permanent bass player.

While the band was in the studio, they were dropped by Epic, and had signed to Interscope Records after Tom Whalley heard the recordings their third album, &quot;Unwritten Law&quot; would be released in June 1998. The singles &quot;Lonesome,&quot; &quot;Cailin,&quot; and &quot;Teenage Suicide&quot; became minor hits on rock radio stations. and the band embarked on the Vans Warped Tour, which took them across North America, Europe, and Australia. In Australia the band developed an enthusiastic and dedicated following, and they would return there over the next few years and release several singles and live recordings exclusive to the country.

===Elva, Music in High Places (2000–2003)===
The band spent a considerable amount of time recording and preparing their next release, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Elva&quot;. The album was a stylistic change of pace, deliberately moving away from their established punk rock formula and towards a more accessible hard rock sound. The lead single &quot;Up All Night&quot; became somewhat popular, but it was &quot;Seein&#x27; Red&quot; and its accompanying music video which brought the band their greatest success, reaching No. 1 on US modern rock charts. They toured extensively in support of the album alongside bands such as Sum 41 and The Used.

In 2003 the band was invited by VH1 to film an episode of the live acoustic series &quot;Music in High Places&quot;. The invitation happened somewhat by accident, as the station was hoping to attract Jimmy Eat World but contacted Unwritten Law&#x27;s management by mistake. The band recorded a set of acoustic performances in various locales at Yellowstone National Park. They prepared the recordings for release as an album, but Interscope declined to release it. The band ended their contract with Interscope and signed to Lava Records, who released &quot;Music in High Places&quot; as an album. The performance was also released as a DVD entitled &quot;Live in Yellowstone&quot;. The song &quot;Rest of My Life&quot; from this performance received airplay on modern rock radio stations nationwide.

===Here&#x27;s to the Mourning (2004–2005)===
In March 2004, it was announced that Youman was ejected from the band due to personal and professional issues, Youman released a statement through his website addressing his departure from the band, In a 2014 interview with DyingScene, Youman would call the split devastating:We were just really hateful towards each other. At that time, me and Scott couldn’t even look at each other because we hated each other so much. It was the same way with Rob at the time. But the label pretty much came in and said “look, you guys have to pick one of these members or the fucking record deal is done 

Me and Scott just couldn’t see these things out. We couldn’t even look at each other. So the band decided to let me go.
Youman would go on to play in various groups, including The Rattlesnake Aces, Demasiado, Underminded, and Black President.

For the recording of their next album &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Mourning&quot; drummers Adrian Young of No Doubt and Tony Palermo of Pulley joined the band in the studio. The band got along so well with Palermo that by the time of the album&#x27;s release in 2005 he had joined as their permanent drummer. Much of the lyrics on the album were co-written by singer Scott Russo&#x27;s girlfriend Aimee Allen, with whom he formed the side project Scott &amp; Aimee. Allen and Linda Perry contributed to the writing of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Save Me (Wake Up Call)&quot;, which reached No. 5 on US modern rock charts. This was followed by the single &quot;She Says&quot;. The band&#x27;s song Celebration Song was featured in the soundtracks of Need For Speed: Underground 2 and MX vs. ATV Unleashed.

In November 2004, the group was banned from CBGB&#x27;s New York. New York has strict indoor smoking laws. Scott was smoking on stage and his monitors were turned off. Later in the show he lit up again and the lights were turned off. The band continued to play in the dark and Scott continued to smoke.

In March 2005 guitarist Rob Brewer was fired from Unwritten Law after a physical altercation on stage with Russo during a performance at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California. Russo and the other band members collectively decided to remove Brewer from the band. The band chose not to replace him and continued on as a 4-piece. They continued to tour in support of &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Mourning&quot; across the United States as well as internationally.

===Best of Compilation, Live and Lawless and Swan (2006–2012) ===
Unwritten Law spent much of 2006 recording a &quot;best of&quot; album entitled &quot;The Hit List&quot;, which was released on January 2, 2007 by Abydos Records. It includes 17 of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, most of which were re-recorded by the current lineup, as well as 2 new songs including lead single &quot;Shoulda Known Better.&quot; Interscope also released a &quot;best of&quot; compilation entitled &quot;20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection&quot; which includes songs from the albums &quot;Unwritten Law&quot; and &quot;Elva&quot;. On January 3, 2007 the band performed &quot;Shoulda Known Better&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. That July the band embarked on a North American tour in support of &quot;The Hit List&quot;, with Scott &amp; Aimee drummer Dylan Howard filling in for roughly half the tour while Palermo stayed home with his wife, who was due to give birth.

Also during 2007, Palermo acted as fill-in touring drummer for Papa Roach. In March 2008 it was announced that Palermo had joined Papa Roach permanently. Meanwhile, Unwritten Law, with new drummer Dylan Howard, filmed a live DVD at the Key Club in Hollywood, California in March 2008. The album, titled &quot;Live and Lawless&quot;, was released September 30, 2008 through Suburban Noize Records. Unwritten Law&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Swan&quot;, was also released through Suburban Noize on March 29, 2011. On January 24, 2011, Unwritten Law posted on their Myspace page the first single from their new album called &quot;Starships and Apocalypse.&quot; They have also been confirmed to play the 2011 Warped Tour.

Guitarist Steve Morris and bassist Pat Kim left Unwritten Law at the end of their Swan Tour in 2011 due to a physical altercation between Scott Russo and Morris. This was kept silent for a few months until after the band finished touring with Warped Tour, although Morris and Kim did not tour with them. Derik Envy, formerly of Red Light Sky, and Kevin Besignano, formerly of Bullets and Octane, had become the permanent replacements for Kim and Morris, respectively.

On August 6, 2011, Youman got invited on stage to play C.P.K. at the Yost Theater in Santa Ana, California., Youman would join the band onstage again in June 2012 to play Harmonic.

===Lineup changes, Acoustic (2013–2021)===
In 2013, Youman, returned to Unwritten Law, after reconciling with Russo. Following Youman&#x27;s return, Derik Envy and Kevin Besignano both left the band, being replaced with Jonny Grill (Russo&#x27;s younger brother) and Ace Von Johnson, respectively, Johnson would later be replaced by former Pivit and Fenix TX guitarist Chris Lewis.

While performing at Capitol in Perth, Western Australia on 18 May 2014, the band ignored requests to stop playing after the venue&#x27;s midnight curfew had passed, forcing the venue to cut the power on stage. Frontman Scott Russo and drummer Wade Youman subsequently destroyed a hired DW Collector&#x27;s Series drum kit.

The band released a compilation album called &quot;Acoustic&quot; on Cyber Track Records on April 1, 2016.

On June 19, 2019 drummer Wade Youman posted on Facebook that he left the band again and was replaced on drums for four shows by RJ Shankle and then on January 27, 2020 Behind Crimson Eyes drummer Dan Kerby posted on Instagram that he would be filling in on drums for shows in Australia. Youman returned to the band for a third time in 2021.

===The Hum (2022)===

<text>The Wairau River is one of the longest rivers in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It flows for from the Spenser Mountains (a northern range of the Southern Alps), firstly in a northwards direction and then northeast down a long, straight valley in inland Marlborough.

The river&#x27;s lower reaches and surrounding fertile plain provide the basis for the Marlborough wine region. The river has its outflow into Cook Strait at Cloudy Bay, just north of Blenheim in the island&#x27;s northeast. The Wairau River meets the sea at the Wairau Bar, an important archaeological site.

In pre-European and early colonial New Zealand, one of the South Island&#x27;s largest Māori settlements was close to the mouth of the Wairau. The Wairau Valley was the scene of the 1843 Wairau Affray, the first violent clash between Māori residents and English settlers over land in New Zealand and the only one to take place in the South Island.

== Hydroelectricity ==
There are currently two hydroelectric power stations operating on tributaries of the river.

The Wairau Hydro Scheme proposed by TrustPower will operate on a long canal. Up to 60 percent of the flow of the river will be diverted into the canal. A resource consent has been granted for the scheme but opponents have already appealed to the Environment Court.

<doc id="1136532" wikidata="Q3268088" url="?curid=1136532" title="USS Brill">
<text>USS &quot;Brill&quot; (SS-330), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy in commission from 1944 to 1947. She was named for the brill, a European flatfish.

&quot;Brill&quot; was commissioned late in World War II, and her war operations extended from 28 January to 9 August 1945. She completed three war patrols in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. &quot;Brill&quot; made few contacts worthy of torpedo fire and consequently had to settle for damaging an unidentified ship of approximately 1,000 gross register tons as her only score.

Decommissioned soon after World War II, &quot;Brill&quot; was transferred to Turkey. She served in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; (S330) from 1948 to 1972.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Brill&quot; was laid down on 23 September 1943 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 25 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Francis S. Low, wife of Rear Admiral Francis S. Low, and commissioned on 26 October 1944, with Commander Harry B. Dodge in command.

==Operational history==

===United States Navy===
====October 1944–February 1945====
Following shakedown training off New England, &quot;Brill&quot; got underway from New London, Connecticut, on 7 December 1944 bound for the Panama Canal. After transiting the canal, Brill took part in intensive training near the Pearl Islands in the Gulf of Panama between 17 and 21 December 1944. Then, on 23 December 1944, she departed the Submarine Base at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she arrived on 8 January 1945.

&quot;Brill&quot; spent a week at Pearl Harbor undergoing voyage repairs and torpedo training before getting underway for the Mariana Islands on 28 January 1945. She conducted drills and battle problems en route and arrived at Saipan on 9 February 1945.

=====First war patrol=====

After refueling at Saipan, &quot;Brill&quot; began her first war patrol. Transiting the Luzon Strait on 15 February 1945 and arrived in her patrol area off Hainan Island in the South China Sea on 19 February. At first, she encountered no Japanese ships, but on 20 February 1945, just after &quot;Brill&quot; sank a floating naval mine with gunfire, her watchstanders saw a torpedo wake approaching on her starboard quarter. &quot;Brill&quot; took evasive action and the torpedo missed, then increased speed to avoid a second torpedo her lookouts sighted. Both torpedoes passed by her on her starboard side before she moved out of range, submerged, and headed hack to search in vain for what she assumed was a Japanese submarine that had attacked her.

The following days were uneventful, bringing &quot;Brill&quot; sightings of sailing junks, Allied aircraft, and some Japanese planes. On 1 March 1945, she made contact on three small Japanese patrol boats in shallow water, probably trying to trap an unsuspecting Allied submarine. Commander Dodge avoided the trap and continued to search for a worthwhile target. On 5 March 1945, he found one. While &quot;Brill&quot; patrolled submerged, Dodge sighted a large Japanese tanker escorted by two destroyers and a plane. &quot;Brill&quot; immediately attempted to move into position to attack the tanker, but gave up the effort an hour later when she could not close the range with it.

On 6 March 1945, &quot;Brill&quot; joined the submarine in a coordinated patrol in the Tonkin Gulf. On 8 March 1945, Japanese planes forced them both to submerge and attacked them with depth charges, but neither submarine sustained damage. On 15 March 1945, while providing lifeguard services for American bombers attacking Hainan Island, &quot;Brill&quot; maneuvered to avoid another torpedo fired at her, presumably by a Japanese submarine. She again was unable to make contact with the attacking Japanese submarine.

On 21 March 1945, &quot;Brill&quot; rendezvoused with the submarine to bring aboard an Australian Army officer and a native Malayan guide for a special mission on Sakala Island. &quot;Brill&quot; patrolled down the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina and arrived off Sakala Island on 25 March 1945. That night, the Australian commando and his partner went ashore. They returned to &quot;Brill&quot; an hour later with five Indonesians. When this entire party had embarked, &quot;Brill&quot; set course for Fremantle, Western Australia, where she completed her patrol with her arrival on 30 March 1945.

=====Second war patrol=====

Following a normal two-week refit and a short training period, &quot;Brill&quot; departed Fremantle on 27 April 1945 to begin her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area in waters off the eastern coast of Japanese-occupied British Malaya. She made no ship contacts worthy of torpedoes and, on 4 June 1945, left her patrol area. She terminated her patrol at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines, where she underwent a refit alongside the submarine tender .

=====Third war patrol=====

On 3 July 1945, &quot;Brill&quot; stood out to sea for her third war patrol. She arrived in her patrol area in the Gulf of Siam on 8 July 1945 and joined other American submarines in patrolling those waters. She encountered two small Japanese patrol vessels on 11 July 1945 and commenced a surface approach for an attack. Although she fired 11 torpedoes, only one scored a hit, the others presumably passing under the hulls of the shallow-draft ships. By this time, &quot;Brill&quot; was inside the curve and the onset of darkness ruled out using her deck guns to sink the patrol vessels, so she broke off the attack.

Another opportunity presented itself on 19 July 1945, when &quot;Brill&quot; encountered a small Japanese convoy of two merchant ships, a destroyer, and two patrol boats. she fired four torpedoes, but scored no hits. She broke off the attack at dawn and departed the area. She made no worthwhile contacts during the remainder of the patrol. On 1 August 1945, she rendezvoused with &quot;Chub&quot; to transfer her remaining gun ammunition to &quot;Chub&quot;, then set course for Fremantle, where she arrived on 9 August 1945 and began a refit alongside the submarine tender . Hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945 while she still undergoing refit.

=====Post-World War II=====

On 31 August 1945 &quot;Brill&quot; departed Fremantle with &quot;Chub&quot; and the submarines and bound for Subic Bay, which she reached on 9 September 1945. There, she served as a unit of Submarines, Philippine Sea Frontier, until January 1946, when she received orders to Pearl Harbor for repairs to her diesel engines. After calling at Pearl Harbor, she got back underway on 5 February 1946 with only three of her four engines in operation, heading east to San Diego, California, for a period of shore leave and upkeep. She reached San Diego on 12 February 1946 and went alongside the submarine tender for repairs.

After a week of refresher training, &quot;Brill&quot; departed San Diego on 23 April 1946 to return to Pearl Harbor, where she commenced an overhaul on 1 May 1946. At the conclusion of the overhaul, she resumed operations with the United States Pacific Fleet. Departing Pearl Harbor on 12 September 1946, &quot;Brill&quot; made a two-month cruise to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Adak in the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak on Kodiak Island, and Indian Island in Puget Sound in Washington. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 November 1946.

&quot;Brill&quot; resumed training exercises around Hawaii with Submarine Squadron 5. During the summer of 1947, she put to sea in company with the submarines and for a coordinated attack exercise against the battleship in the Hawaiian Islands. Taking up a position in the Alenuihaha Channel, the submarines attempted to intercept the battleship as she made a high-speed run between Maui and the island of Hawaii. Although &quot;Iowa&quot; enjoyed land-based air cover and tried to throw off her pursuers by several radical course changes, the submarines still achieved four &quot;successful&quot; mock attacks against the battleship.

&quot;Brill&quot; again resumed training exercises in Hawaiian waters with Submarine Squadron 5 until 4 September 1947, when she departed Pearl Harbor for San Diego. She commenced overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California, on 29 September 1947. Leaving the shipyard early in 1948, she completed refresher training and departed on 24 February 1948 for Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, where she arrived on 16 March 1948. She was decommissioned there on 23 May 1948 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 May 1948.

====Honors and awards====
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service

===Turkish Navy===

&quot;Brill&quot; was turned over to Turkey on 23 May 1948 and was commissioned in the Turkish Navy the same day as TCG &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; (S330) (&quot;First Inonu&quot;), also written as 1. İnönü, the second submarine of that name. She was named in commemoration of the Turkish victory at the First Battle of İnönü in January 1921.

In 1952–1953 &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; was converted into a GUPPY Fleet Snorkel submarine. The interior work was done at Turkey&#x27;s Gölcük Naval Yard, then the conversion was completed in the United States.

&quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; was decommissioned on 29 November 1972. She was sold to Stavros Vamvounakis of Athens, Greece, in November 1980 for scrapping.

<text>David Mills, (March 18, 1831 – May 8, 1903) was a Canadian politician, author, poet and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

He was born in Palmyra, in southwestern Upper Canada (now Ontario). His father, Nathaniel Mills, was one of the first settlers in the area. Mills served as superintendent of schools for Kent County from 1856 to 1865. He then attended the University of Michigan School of law, graduating with honors in 1867 with an LL.B degree.

He published &quot;The Present and Future Political Aspects of Canada&quot; in 1860 and &quot;The Blunders of the Dominion Government in connection with the North-West Territory&quot; in 1871.

Mills was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1867 federal election and re-elected in four subsequent votes until being defeated in the 1882 election. He was an opponent of dual representation (the practice in which someone could simultaneously be a member of parliament as well as a member of the Ontario or Quebec legislature. He unsuccessfully introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to abolish this practice, and continued to advocate for this until it was abolished in 1873.

During the debates surrounding the creation of the Supreme Court of Canada in 1875, Mills was one of the few exceptions who opposed granting the court jurisdiction over provincial law, as he viewed it as contrary to Canada&#x27;s federalist structure.

He returned to Parliament through an 1884 by-election. He was re-elected in subsequent elections until his defeat in the 1896 election despite this being the election that brought the Liberals back to power.

He served as Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet of Alexander Mackenzie from 1876 to 1878. Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed Mills to the Senate of Canada after he lost his Commons seat in 1896, and appointed him to Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate. He resigned from the Senate and Cabinet in 1902. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on February 8, 1902, and served on the Court for one year until his death in 1903.

<doc id="1136537" wikidata="Q3303257" url="?curid=1136537" title="Hurricane Ginger">
<text>Hurricane Ginger was the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25 days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September 6 to October 3. Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). On September 14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September 23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.

While over the western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September 30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10 million (1971 US dollars$,  USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside North Carolina.

Ginger has the highest accumulated cyclone energy for a hurricane below major hurricane strength in the Atlantic basin, at 44.2.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Ginger originated in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted for several days in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also led to the formation of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas.

After forming, the depression moved slowly southeastward for about 24  hours before turning to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, the depression turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh named storm of the year in the Atlantic, about 325 mi (525 km) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum barometric pressure of 959 mbar (28.32 inHg), and early the next day reached peak maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores, the hurricane&#x27;s eastward movement halted due to a building ridge to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.
For about six days, Ginger maintained minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained an unusually large eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned to the south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.

For three days, beginning on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane as part of Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane to be a part of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger&#x27;s large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.

==Preparations==
The threat of the hurricane in Bermuda prompted the British Royal Navy to evacuate a ship, and also resulted in two cruise ships leaving early. The United States military also evacuated some planes and secured the units that remained. Officials closed all of the island&#x27;s schools during Ginger&#x27;s passage.

Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the American Red Cross set up 28 emergency shelters in six counties, where about 5,500 people stayed during the storm. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Virginia Beach, Virginia, with gale warnings extending northward to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. United States military officials evacuated planes and ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, in addition to flying planes down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm. Ferry services around the Outer Banks were canceled during the storm&#x27;s passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses.

==Impact==

As the hurricane passed south of Bermuda on September 23, it produced heavy waves, as well as gale force winds for 17 hours. Naval Air Station Bermuda reported peak gusts of 75 mph (120 km/h). There was no reported damage, and the hurricane&#x27;s passage failed to alleviate persistent drought conditions.

While Ginger was still in the vicinity of Bermuda, it produced high swells and riptides along the East Coast of the United States, prompting the issuing of small craft warnings from Florida to North Carolina. Wave heights reached in Sebastian, Florida, and one person was killed in St. Augustine from drowning. There were also initial reports of two missing people in Neptune Beach, Florida, but they were not listed as casualties in the year-end hurricane summary.

As it moved ashore in North Carolina, Ginger produced a storm tide of around along the Outer Banks and up to in Pamlico Sound. The storm dropped heavy rainfall peaking at in Bodie Island along the Outer Banks, making Ginger among the wettest tropical cyclones in the state. Rainfall from the storm extended southwestward into South Carolina, where precipitation reached in Cheraw. In Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, wind gusts reached , the highest associated with Ginger in the United States. The hurricane had a large wind field upon moving ashore, affecting a large portion of North Carolina; one county official considered Ginger the largest storm in the region since 1936.
Strong winds from Ginger damaged store fronts and windows, and also downed power lines and trees. Morehead City, where the hurricane moved ashore, lost power and had debris strewn across the streets. The nearby cities of New Bern, Beaufort, and Atlantic Beach also lost power, and one company had 6,000 customers without power. Heavy rainfall caused the Neuse and Trent rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding. Several oil tanks along the rivers broke open, creating dangerous boating conditions. Up to of water from the Pungo River flooded most of the city of Belhaven, and similar flooding occurred in Washington, entering dozens of buildings and houses. Across the region, the combination of high winds, tides, and flooding closed several bridges and roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 70. The winds also destroyed several mobile homes, although coastal damage was less than expected. During Ginger&#x27;s passage, the Salvation Army and Red Cross provided more than 3,000 people with food assistance.

Further inland, the combination of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3 million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to about half of the crop having been harvested before the storm&#x27;s arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24 counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10 million (1971 USD$,  USD), of which about $1 million (1971 USD$,  USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.

As the storm crossed into Virginia, it continued to produce heavy rainfall, including a total of in Norfolk. Near the border between Virginia and North Carolina, the storm produced tides of up to above normal. Gusty winds of over downed a few trees, causing scattered power outages. Above-normal tides and waves caused moderate to heavy beach erosion in Virginia Beach. Further north, Ginger produced above-normal tides, light winds, and scattered rainfall along the Delmarva Peninsula and northward through New York.

==Record longevity==
Hurricane Ginger formed on September 6 and lasted until October 3, for a total of 27.25 days. Its duration surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days. In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.

Ginger spent 20 days as a hurricane from September 11 to September 30, one of the longest durations on record at that intensity. In addition, Ginger co-existed with several other tropical cyclones, including on September 11 when there were four named storms at the same time, a rare occurrence; the others were Hurricane Edith, Hurricane Fern, and Tropical Storm Heidi.

<text>Pete Droge (born March 11, 1969) is an American alternative/folk rock musician from Vashon Island in Washington State&#x27;s Puget Sound.

Droge was born in Eugene, Oregon. He was adopted and his family relocated to Seattle, Washington, and grew up in Bainbridge Island. In the 1980s, Droge attended Bainbridge Island High School and graduated.

== Career ==

=== 1990s ===
Droge was in a succession of garage bands, such as March of Crimes and 25th Hour, eventually leading to his career as a solo artist. In 1990, the first band he fronted was Ramadillo, a Seattle-based rock band with bassist Sean Mugrage, and drummer Mark Boquist. During their lifetime, the band did not obtain a record deal, but self-released a full-length album on cassette tape titled &quot;West of Here&quot;. However, Ramadillo dissolved in 1992, two years after their initial formation. Droge later released an old single &quot;Devil&#x27;s in the Best of Moods&quot; on Between the Cracks Records in 2023.

In January 1993, Droge met his long-term collaborator and wife Elaine Summers. They first met at the opening of the Portland club The Living Room and immediately started working together, with Summers harmonizing as a backing vocalist at local gigs. Droge opened for B.B. King, Johnny Cash, Lucinda Williams, Rickie Lee Jones, and Warren Zevon, among others.

In 1994, Droge released &quot;Necktie Second&quot;, his debut album which featured the tongue-in-cheek hit song &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me (I&#x27;ll Kill Myself)&quot; (which also appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;), as well as, &quot;Sunspot Stopwatch&quot; and &quot;So I am Over You&quot;. Droge was signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings and had Kelly Curtis for a manager, who also managed the band Pearl Jam. Droge was good friends with guitarist Mike McCready.

In May 1995, Droge opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on the Dogs with Wings tour. Droge first met Tom Petty at Neil Young&#x27;s Bridge School Benefit in 1994. Petty then watched Droge and his band perform at The Viper Room in Los Angeles, California, and proceeded to invite Droge on his tour. 

=== Pete Droge &amp; The Sinners ===
In 1996, Droge released &quot;Find a Door,&quot; an album under the name of Pete Droge and The Sinners; his backing band included Dave Hull (bass), Rob Brill (drums), Peter Stroud (guitar/vocals) and Elaine Summers (guitar/vocals). This album met with critical success but received little airplay. Notable songs include &quot;You Should Be Running&quot;, &quot;Dear Diane&quot; and &quot;Mr. Jade&quot;. That same year, Droge contributed the title song to the film, &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;.

In 1998, Droge released &quot;Spacey and Shakin&quot;, another solo album.

Other credits included contributions to albums by Kim Richey and Stone Gossard.

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, Droge appeared in the film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; as a &quot;Hyatt Singer&quot;, performing &quot;Small Time Blues&quot; with Elaine Summers. According to director Cameron Crowe on the Director&#x27;s Cut Commentary of the movie, the small part was a tribute to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, whom Crowe had met in 1973.

Droge is credited with the original score for the film &quot;Tattoo, a Love Story&quot;.

=== The Thorns ===

In 2003, Droge formed the group The Thorns with artists Matthew Sweet and Shawn Mullins. In the same year, Droge released another solo album, &quot;Skywatching&quot;. In 2006, Droge released &quot;Under the Waves&quot; and a song from that album, &quot;Going Whichever Way the Wind Blows&quot;, was featured in a Toyota Sequoia commercial.

In 2009, Droge&#x27;s song &quot;Two of the Lucky Ones&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Zombieland.&quot;

=== The Droge &amp; Summers Blend ===
Throughout the years, Droge and Elaine Summers have collaborated and released a series of volume albums from 2009 to most recently in 2023.

== Musical style and influences ==
Droge grew up with a range of influences including Bob Dylan&#x27;s Nashville Skyline, Waylon &amp; Willie, and Johnny Cash. He later discovered the heavier music of KISS, AC/DC, and Led Zeppelin.

Droge has been compared to artists Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Tom Petty, and Gram Parsons. In 1995, Droge told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about Parsons, &quot;I fell in love with the fragileness of his voice. He wasn&#x27;t a great singer in a technical sense, but he sang with such urgency and immediacy. The songs too were very simple and pure—stories about the choices people have. There was also these religious overtones to a lot of what he did, mixing gospel and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll elements about temptation and salvation in ways that left you wondering just where he stood. It&#x27;s not too clear to you.&quot;

<doc id="1136544" wikidata="Q42640" url="?curid=1136544" title="Ojos Azules">
<text> (, &#x27;Blue Eyes&#x27;) was a breed of shorthaired domestic cat with unusual blue or odd eyes caused by a dominant blue eye (DBE) genetic mutation. The breed came in all coat colors; however, only particolors (bicolors and tricolors), colorpoints, and intermediate colors with a characteristic white tail tip were permitted. The breed also had a semi-longhaired coat variety, the Longhair. Due to the lethal side effects of the gene, breeders stopped working with this blue eye mutation.

==History==

In the 1980s cats with dark blue eyes were discovered among feral cat populations in New Mexico. The first cat with the characteristic, discovered in 1984, was a tortoiseshell named Cornflower. She was bred to males without the trait, which proved to be dominant, as all her kittens showed it. The breed was founded and named , Spanish for &#x27;Blue Eyes&#x27;.

===Registration and popularity===

 have always been a very rare breed. In 1992, only ten cats were known. The breed, in both short and long hair variety, was accepted for registration by TICA in 1991. The TICA Breed Group Standard is dated January 5, 2004. Only cats descending from the original foundation female &quot;Cornflower&quot; and expressing the deep blue eye gene have been called . It was discovered that cranial defects may be linked to the gene, and breeding was temporarily suspended. Eventually, breeders stopped working with cats bearing this blue eye mutation and the breed became officially extinct.

== &quot;Ojos Azules&quot; gene ==
 were remarkable for their deep blue eyes. The depth of color in the eyes is described as being greater even than that seen in a Siamese and does not cause squinting, deafness or cross-eye. This eye coloration depth in is due to currently unknown polygenetic variations.

Unlike the blue eyes seen linked to the genes in solid white, bicolor, and colorpoint, all of which suppress pigmentation, this gene is not linked to any specific fur color or pattern, giving the opportunity to have cats with dark coats and blue eyes. The blue eye color seen in cats such as the Siamese and the is due to the same physical phenomenon, the absence of melanin in the iris. Although the cause of the absence of pigment differs between Siamese, white cats, and , the result is pigment loss and blue eyes. One indicator of the gene was a flattened, white tail-tip. 

Following a genetic investigation by Solveig Pflueger, breeding resumed in a small way with attempts to breed without the lethal genetic defects. It was discovered that when the gene is homozygous it caused cranial deformities, white fur, a small curled tail, and stillbirth. However, when the gene was heterozygous, those lethal genetic mutations did not manifest. The result was that breeders crossed the blue-eyed cats with non-blue-eyed cats, assuring a litter of about 50/50 blue/non-blue-eyed kittens.

==Description==

=== Appearance ===

The medium-sized was known for its bluish eyes, which were large and round. The neck was arched. The tail was proportionate to the cat&#x27;s body. The head was somewhat triangular in inscribe. It had a slightly rounded forehead and an angular muzzle. The nose had a slight break. The coat was short, fine, soft, silky, and shiny. The undercoat was not particularly developed, but most were dense in color. All colors were allowed. However, only particolors (bicolors and tricolors), colorpoints, and intermediate colors with a white tail tip were permitted. White markings were common on most extremities (tip of the tail, muzzle, and paws). However, belly spots or chest spots were not acceptable and were considered faults. Solid white coats were not desirable, as they could only be distinguished from common white blue-eyed cats with genetic tests. Solid white blue-eyed were susceptible to deafness, as is common in white blue-eyed cats without the mutation.

== Revival of dominant blue eyed breeds ==

Apart from the extinct , several other dominant blue eye (DBE) genes have been found in cats worldwide. These are not , as they are not descending from Cornflower. The cats bear DBE mutations, and are developed into new cat breeds or approved as eye coloration variants in existing breeds by certain cat registries.

<doc id="1136546" wikidata="Q1228985" url="?curid=1136546" title="Disney Dollars">
<text>Disney Dollars is a form of corporate scrip previously sold by The Walt Disney Company and redeemable for goods or services at many Disney facilities.

Similar in size and design to the paper currency of the United States, most bills bear the image of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Dumbo, or a drawing of one of the landmarks of the Disneyland Resort or Walt Disney World Resort.

Disney Dollars came in series of A and D—the former created for the Disneyland Resort in southern California and the latter for the Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida.

Despite the currency being discontinued from printing and sale by Disney on May 14, 2016, it must, and still does, accept bills at the company&#x27;s United States theme parks, the Disney cruise ships, the Disney Store and at certain parts of Castaway Cay (Disney&#x27;s private island in the Caribbean).

==History ==
Disney Dollars were first used in Disneyland on May 5, 1987, while Walt Disney World started with the currency being used at Epcot on October 2. In 1992, Disney Stores started using the scrip. For Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 65th birthday in 1993, a special $1 Disney dollar was issued.

Every Disney Dollar was signed by &quot;treasurer&quot; Scrooge McDuck, and had an image of Tinker Bell on the front.

==Use==
The bills are redeemable for goods or services at the Disney theme parks, the Disney cruise ships, Disney&#x27;s Castaway Cay port of call and the Disney Stores, unless indications to the contrary are printed on the individual bills. However, they are not compatible with coin machines, and must be exchanged for U.S. currency if machines are to be used. In addition, if Disney Dollars are used for purchases and change is given, the change is provided in U.S. currency.

They are often kept as souvenirs or collected by Disney memorabilia fans, but at Disney resorts, they can also be exchanged back to U.S. currency.

Disney stopped distributing and printing the currency on May 14, 2016; however, they will still accept them in the future.

==Security features==
Disney Dollars were created with anti-counterfeiting features such as microprinting, and reflective ink and imprinting on the front and back of the bill to deter scanning and copying. In addition, the bills are printed with serial numbers and letters which are unique to each bill. The Dollars have small bits of glitter scattered on them.

<text>Port Gore (officially / Port Gore) is a bay and natural harbour at the northern end of the Marlborough Sounds in New Zealand. It is close to the northern tip of the South Island, at the western end of Cook Strait. It is directly west of the entrance to Queen Charlotte Sound.

Port Gore is the resting place of the Soviet luxury cruise liner, the &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot;, which sank on 16 February 1986 as a result of attempting to navigate the narrow passage between Cape Jackson and the Lighthouse Rock. As a consequence of the disaster, Russian President Boris Yeltsin joked that New Zealand was the only country to get away with sinking a Russian ship. It is now a popular attraction as the largest fully intact wreck dive in the world and easily accessible at a depth of only .

In August 2014, the name of the bay was officially altered to Te Anamāhanga / Port Gore.

<text>Kenneth Spicer Wherry (February 28, 1892November 29, 1951) was an American businessman, attorney, and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a U.S. senator from Nebraska from 1943 until his death in 1951; he was the minority leader for the last two years.

==Early life==
Wherry was the third of five children born in Liberty, Nebraska, to David Emery and Jessie (née Comstock) Wherry. He received his early education at public schools in Pawnee City, and graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity) in 1914. From 1915 to 1916, he studied business administration at Harvard Business School. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy Flying Corps (1917–18).

Following his military service, Wherry began a business career selling automobiles, furniture, and livestock; he was also a licensed undertaker with offices in Nebraska and Kansas. He also studied law and, after being admitted to the bar, entered private practice in Pawnee City.

==Political career==
Wherry entered politics as a member of Pawnee City&#x27;s city council, serving in 1927 and 1929. He was the mayor from 1929 to 1931, simultaneously serving as a member of the state senate from 1929 to 1932. Wherry was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for governor in 1932 and for U.S. Senator in 1934.

In 1938, Wherry was again elected mayor of Pawnee City, serving until he left for Washington and the U.S. Senate. He was chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party from 1939 to 1942, and Western Director for the Republican National Committee from 1941 to 1942.

===U.S. Senator===
In 1942, Wherry was elected to the U.S. Senate, unseating incumbent George W. Norris. He was reelected in 1948 and served until his death. He served as Republican whip from 1944 to 1949 and minority leader from 1949 to 1951. He was also one of the few postwar politicos to see the plight of the defeated Germans. &quot;The American people should know once and for all that as a result of this government’s official policy they are being made...accomplices in the crime of mass starvation...Germany is the only nation subjected to a deliberate starvation policy...&quot;

In 1945, Wherry was among the seven senators who opposed full U.S. entry into the United Nations.

Wherry also backed, with Senator Homer Capehart of Indiana, legislation for building military family housing in the post-World War II era, when there were critical shortages of such housing.

Wherry represented the isolationist views of his large German-American constituency. He intensely opposed international activities by the federal government, including entry into World War II, the Cold War, and the Korea War. He vigorously opposed any loans or aid to Europe. He did not believe that the Soviet Union threatened Nebraska&#x27;s interests, and he strongly opposed the Truman Doctrine, and NATO. Wherry believed that it made no sense to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential.

Wherry was the unsuccessful leader in the fight to block the Marshall Plan in Congress in early 1948. Congress, under the control of Republicans, agreed to the Marshall Plan and its funding for multiple reasons. The 20-member conservative isolationist wing of the party was led by Wherry. Wherry and his men argued that it would be a wasteful &quot;operation rat-hole.&quot; He was outmaneuvered by the internationalist wing, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. Vandenberg admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator Robert A. Taft, the most prominent conservative, hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however it was &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; in &quot;the world battle against communism.&quot; In the end, only 17 senators voted against the Marshall Plan on March 13, 1948.

Whatever the issue, Wherry could be counted on as a strong opponent of the presidency of Harry Truman.

In 1950, Robert A. Taft&#x27;s Fair Employment Practice Committee bill was filibustered in the U.S. Senate. Wherry joined most Republicans in supporting cloture, although cloture was not invoked.

Wherry was strongly opposed to homosexuals serving the US government. In 1950, he asked his Senate colleagues &quot;can [you] think of a person who could be more dangerous to the United States of America than a pervert?&quot; In a 1950 interview, he told Max Lerner that &quot;You can&#x27;t hardly separate homosexuals from subversives&quot; and &quot;But look Lerner, we&#x27;re both Americans, aren&#x27;t we? I say, let&#x27;s get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.&quot;

He publicized his fear that Adolf Hitler had given Joseph Stalin a list of closeted homosexuals in government, which he believed Stalin would use to blackmail these same homosexuals into becoming Soviet spies. In the spring of 1950, Wherry joined Senator Lister Hill, a Democrat from Alabama, in a congressional investigation of homosexuals in government, particularly the Department of State. He was particularly concerned with communist influence, saying &quot;Only the most naïve could believe that the Communists&#x27; fifth column in the United States would neglect to propagate and use homosexuals to gain their treacherous ends.&quot;

=== Buchenwald concentration camp ===
On April 11, 1945, US forces liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp, which was established in 1937 and caused the deaths of at least 56,545 people. General Eisenhower left rotting corpses unburied so a visiting group of U.S. legislators could truly understand the horror of the atrocities. This group was visiting Buchenwald to inspect the camp and learn firsthand about the enormity of the Nazi Final Solution and treatment of other prisoners. Wherry visited the camp along with Alben W. Barkley, Ed Izac, John M. Vorys, Dewey Short, C. Wayland Brooks, General Omar N. Bradley, and journalists Joseph Pulitzer, Norman Chandler, William I. Nichols and Julius Ochs Adler.

==Death==
Wherry died in Washington in 1951 at age 59, while serving as Republican Floor Leader. Recovering from abdominal surgery a few weeks earlier, he felt ill and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and died of pneumonia several hours later.

The fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 seat, from January 3, 1949, to January 3, 1955, was unusual in that it saw six senators occupy the seat, beginning with Wherry.

<doc id="1136553" wikidata="Q84636842" url="?curid=1136553" title="Brummagem">
<text>Brummagem ( , ), and historically also Bromichan, Bremicham and many similar variants, is the local name for the city of Birmingham, England, and the dialect associated with it. It gave rise to the terms Brum (a shortened version of Brummagem) and Brummie (applied to inhabitants of the city, their accent and dialect).

&quot;Brummagem&quot; and &quot;Brummagem ware&quot; are also terms for cheap and shoddy imitations, in particular when referring to mass-produced goods. This use is archaic in the UK, but persists in some specialist areas in the US and Australia.

==History==
The word appeared in the Middle Ages as a variant on the older and coexisting form of &quot;Birmingham&quot; (spelled &quot;Bermingeham&quot; in Domesday Book), and was in widespread use by the time of the Civil War.

===17th century===
The term&#x27;s pejorative use appears to have originated with the city&#x27;s brief 17th-century reputation for counterfeited groats.

Birmingham&#x27;s expanding metal industries included the manufacture of weapons. In 1636, one Benjamin Stone petitioned that a large number of swords, which he claimed to have made, should be purchased for the use in the King&#x27;s service; but in 1637, the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, in London, countered this by stating that these were actually &quot;bromedgham blades&quot; and foreign blades, and that the former &quot;are no way serviceable or fit for his Majesty&#x27;s store&quot;. John F. Hayward, an experienced historian on swords, suggests that London&#x27;s snobbery towards these blades at that time &quot;may have been due to&quot; commercial rivalry; at that time London was the largest provider of weapons in Britain, and Birmingham was fast becoming a viable commercial threat to their trade.

The word passed into political slang in the 1680s. The Protestant supporters of the Exclusion Bill were called by their opponents &quot;Birminghams&quot; or &quot;Brummagems&quot; (a slur, in allusion to counterfeiting, implying hypocrisy). Their Tory opponents were known as &quot;anti-Birminghams&quot; or &quot;anti-Brummagems&quot;.

Around 1690 Alexander Missen, visiting Bromichan in his travels, said that &quot;swords, heads of canes, snuff-boxes, and other fine works of steel,&quot; could be had, &quot;cheaper and better here than even in famed Milan.&quot;

Guy Miege, in &quot;The New State of England&quot; (1691), wrote: &quot;Bromicham is a large and well-built Town, very populous, and much resorted unto; particularly noted, few years ago, for the counterfeit Groats made here, and from hence dispersed all over the Kingdom.&quot;

===18th century===
During the 18th century Birmingham was known by several variations of the name &quot;Brummagem&quot;.

In 1731, an old &quot;road-book&quot; said that &quot;Birmingham, Bromicham, or Bremicham, is a large town, well built and populous. The inhabitants, being mostly smiths, are very ingenious in their way, and vend vast quantities of all sorts of iron wares.&quot;

Around 1750, &quot;England&#x27;s Gazetteer&quot; described Birmingham or Bromichan as &quot;a large, well-built, and populous town, noted for the most ingenious artificers in boxes, buckles, buttons, and other iron and steel wares; wherein such multitudes of people are employed that they are sent all over Europe; and here is a continual noise of hammers, anvils, and files&quot;.

The town was renowned for its miscellany of metal and silver industries, some of whose manufacturers used cheap materials, exhibiting poor quality and design. The poorer-quality &quot;Brummagem ware&quot; was beginning to give the better more skilled metal workers of the town a bad name; Matthew Boulton of the Lunar Society and several toy makers and silversmiths realized this and campaigned to have the town&#x27;s first assay office constructed. Great opposition came from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London but royal assent was given for assay offices in both Birmingham and Sheffield on the same day. Eventually this filtered out much of the poor workmanship of silver and jewellery in Birmingham, keeping mainly the higher-quality jewellery produced, which ultimately enabled the town to become one of the most important silver manufacturing centres in the 19th century.

It is thought by some, including historian Carl Chinn, that around this time Matthew Boulton favoured &quot;Birmingham&quot; over &quot;Brummagem&quot; to avoid negative connotations.

===19th century===
By the 19th century Birmingham had become one of the most important players in the Industrial Revolution. Matthew Boulton had taken part in the first British trade missions to China and the city was one of the most advanced, diverse and productive manufacturing centres in the modern world. Birmingham was sometimes referred to as the &quot;toyshop of Europe&quot;, &quot;workshop of the world&quot;, or &quot;city of a thousand trades&quot;. The Birmingham pen trade prospered and areas such as the Gun Quarter and Jewellery Quarter existed with high standards of production set out by institutions such as the Birmingham Proof House and Birmingham Assay Office. The Birmingham Mint also became internationally renowned for its high-quality coins, as did Cadburys for its chocolate and workers&#x27; welfare and rights.

With such a vast array of items being produced it was inevitable that not all would have been of high quality; and the advances of the industrial revolution enabled machines to mass-produce cheaper items such as buttons, toys, trinkets and costume jewellery. The poor quality of a proportion of these gave rise to a pejorative use of the word, &quot;Brummagem ware&quot;, although such items were not exclusive to the city.

The significant button industry gave rise to the term &quot;Brummagem button&quot;. Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836) mentions it as a term for counterfeit silver coins; but Samuel Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Rides on Railways&quot; (1851) refers to it as &quot;an old-fashioned nickname for a Birmingham workman&quot;.
By the late 19th century, &quot;Brummagem&quot; was still used as a term for Birmingham. Some people still used it as a general term for anything cheap and shoddy disguised as something better. It was used figuratively in this context to refer to moral fakery: for instance, the &quot;Times&quot; leader, 29 January 1838, reported Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s slur on an opponent: &quot;[who] knew the sort of Brummagem stuff he had to deal with, treated the pledge and him who made it with utter indifference&quot;.

One particularly negative use of the word is &quot;brummagem screwdriver&quot;, a term for a hammer, a jibe which suggested that Brummie workers were unskilled and unsophisticated, though it was similarly applied to the French and Irish.

The negative use of the word was included in several dictionaries around the world.



The term was not always used with negative meaning. A character in Jeffery Farnol&#x27;s novel &quot;The Broad Highway&quot; (1910) comments:

and the Rev. Richard H. Barham:
However, as shown by James Dobbs&#x27;s song &quot;I can&#x27;t find Brummagem&quot; (see below), it remained in use as a geographical name for the city.

In the Henry James story &quot;The Lesson of the Master&quot; (1888), the novelist Henry St. George refers to his &quot;beautiful fortunate home&quot; as &quot;brummagem&quot; to indicate that it is worth little in comparison to what he has given up to have it; he has sacrificed his pursuit of great writing in order to live the life of a comfortable, well-off man. He expresses his regret to the story&#x27;s protagonist, an aspiring young writer named Paul Overt.

The Birmingham politician Joseph Chamberlain was nicknamed &quot;Brummagem Joe&quot; (affectionately or satirically, depending on the speaker). See, for instance, &quot;The Times&quot;, 6 August 1895: &quot;&#x27;Chamberlain and his crew&#x27; dominated the city ... Mr Geard thought it was advisable to have a candidate against &#x27;Brummagem Joe&#x27;&quot;.

There were many contradictory comments and accounts to the idea that Birmingham or Brummagem was associated with poor-quality manufacture around the 19th century. Robert Southey wrote in 1807: &quot;Probably in no other age or country was there ever such an astonishing display of human ingenuity as may be found in Birmingham.&quot;

==Modern usage==
&quot;Brummagem&quot; remained a staple of British political and critical discourse into the early 20th century. &quot;The Times&quot; of 13 August 1901 quoted a House of Commons speech by J. G. Swift MacNeill on the subject of the Royal Titles Bill: &quot;The initiative of the Bill ... had the &#x27;Brummagem&#x27; brand from top to bottom. It was a mean attempt, inspired by the absurd and vulgar spirit of Imperialism, to subsidize the Crown with a parvenu title, and a tawdry gewgaw reputation&quot;.

A &quot;Punch&quot; book review for December 1917 said: &quot;But, to be honest, the others (with the exception of one quaint little comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, too full of snakes and hidden treasure and general tawdriness – the kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one used to associate chiefly with the Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition. Mrs. PERRIN must not mingle her genuine native goods with such Brummagem ware&quot;.

In John Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;In Chancery&quot; (1920), the second volume of his Forsyte Saga trilogy (Book II, Part II, Chapter I: The Third Generation), when responding to the question, &quot;Do you know Crum?&quot;, Jolly Forsyte replies, &quot;Of Merton? Only by sight. He&#x27;s in that fast set too, isn&#x27;t he? Rather La-di-da and Brummagem.&quot; Around this time, Birmingham&#x27;s foremost criminal gang referred to themselves as the Brummagem boys.

By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British usage had shifted toward a purely geographical and even positive sense. The Housing Design Awards 1998 said of one Birmingham project, City Heights, &quot;this gutsy Brummagem bruiser of a building handles its landmark status with ease and assurance&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;Notes from the touchline&quot; sport report, 21 March 2003, journalist Frank Keating used the headline &quot;World Cup shines with dinkum Brummagem&quot; to praise the performance of Birmingham-born Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds.

A particular activist in reclaiming the term as a traditional name reflecting positive aspects of the city&#x27;s heritage is historian Carl Chinn MBE, Professor of Community History at the University of Birmingham, who produces &quot;Brummagem Magazine&quot;.

The British poet Roy Fisher (b. 1930) uses the term in his poetry sequence, &quot;Six Texts For a Film&quot;, in &quot;Birmingham River&quot; (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994). &quot;Birmingham&#x27;s what I think with. / It&#x27;s not made for that sort of job,/ but it&#x27;s what they gave me. / As a means of thinking, it&#x27;s a Brummagem/ screwdriver&quot; (lines 1–4).

The village of New Birmingham/Glengoole in County Tipperary, Ireland is known locally as &quot;Brimigim&quot;.

==US usage==

In the US, the negative usage appears to have continued into the 1930s. F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; uses the word twice: &quot;It was one of the type known as &#x27;tourist&#x27; cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman ... a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive&quot;. Gilbert Seldes, in his 1924 book &quot;The Seven Lively Arts&quot;, wrote in praise of Krazy Kat: &quot;everything paste and brummagem has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed&quot;. It appears in two essays by H.L. Mencken from 1926: &quot;Valentino&quot; (&quot;Consider the sordid comedy of his two marriages – the brummagem, star-spangled passion that invaded his very deathbed!&quot;) and &quot;A Glance Ahead&quot; (&quot;It would be hard to find a country in which such brummagem serene highnesses are revered with more passionate devotion than they get in the United States.&quot;). Mencken&#x27;s influence is apparent when the term appears in John Fante&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;: &quot;The church must go, it is the haven of the booboisie, of boobs and bounders and all brummagem mountebanks.&quot;

Currently US collectors of political memorabilia use &quot;brummagem&quot; to refer to imitations. The &quot;Dictionary of Sexual Terms and Expressions&quot; by Farlex Inc., maintainers of TheFreeDictionary.com, lists several related terms such as &quot;Brummagem buttons&quot;, tufts sewn to brassiere cups to give the appearance of larger nipples. Lemony Snicket, in his 1999 young adult novel &quot;The Reptile Room&quot;, introduces brummagem as a &quot;rare word for &#x27;fake&#x27;&quot;.

==Brummagem in song==
A song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Find Brummagem&quot;, was written by James Dobbs (1781–1837), a Midland music hall entertainer.

&quot;The Birmingham School of Business School&quot;, a song by The Fall on the 1992 album &quot;&quot;, about the &quot;creative accounting techniques&quot; of Trevor Long, a manager of the band, includes the lyric &quot;Brummagem School of Business School&quot;.

<text>Lewis St. George Stubbs (June 14, 1878 – May 12, 1958) was a prominent judge and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1949 as an Independent, He promoted left-wing and socially progressive causes including Henry George&#x27;s Single Tax (Georgism).

== Early life ==
The son of Alfred Stubbs and Mary P. Durham, Stubbs was born on the island of Cockburn Harbour in the Turks and Caicos Islands, in the British West Indies. His family were wealthy colonial settlers whose ancestors had abandoned Georgia during the American Revolution; Stubbs later described them as &quot;real Tories, the old-fashioned kind&quot;. Stubbs was educated at York Castle in Jamaica and St. Chad&#x27;s College in Staffordshire, England. In 1898, he enrolled to study medicine at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge University, and intended to become a medical missionary in Africa.

In 1899, Stubbs enlisted as a private in the British Army to fight in the Second Boer War. He quickly became disillusioned with both military life and the cause for which he was fighting, and never spoke of his participation with any enthusiasm in later life. He abandoned his medical research on returning to England, and sought a new calling.

== Life in Manitoba ==
In 1902, Stubbs moved to Deleau (near Brandon) Manitoba to work as a farmhand. He moved to Winnipeg later in the year; although initially planning to move to British Columbia, he chose to remain in the city after meeting Mary Wilcox, later his wife. He became a law student, and struck up a friendship with Fred Dixon, later a prominent labourist politician in the city. Stubbs himself had by this point converted to philosophical liberalism. Stubbs was called to the Manitoba bar in 1906.

In 1908, he opened a legal practice in Birtle, where he also worked as a farmer. During the federal election of 1917, Stubbs was one of the few public figures in the community to oppose conscription and the government of Robert Borden.

== Political career ==
In the 1921 federal election, Stubbs ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Marquette against Thomas Crerar, leader of the Progressive Party. He held no illusions of winning, and indeed finished a distant third with only 553 votes (against 9873 for Crerar). He was rewarded for his services by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on May 20, 1922, being appointed a County Court Judge in the Eastern Judicial District of Manitoba. On July 4, 1924, he became a Senior County Court Judge.

As a judge, Stubbs often provoked controversy with Manitoba and Canada governments. A strict temperance man himself, Stubbs insisted that the province&#x27;s prohibition laws be followed to the letter. He also rendered several judgments that excoriated the capitalist system, lamenting the punishment of petty criminals while corrupt plutocrats operated above the law.

Stubbs was also criticized by some in government for granting unduly lenient sentences. In 1932 he was the subject of a Royal Commission of inquiry into his judicial conduct. Many regarded the inquiry as a politically motivated farce. Stubbs was found guilty of judicial misbehaviour. The final report indicated that he was temperamentally unfit to hold office. Though removed from the bench, his cause was supported by many ordinary Manitobans, particularly those on the political left.

In late 1933, Stubbs ran for the House of Commons of Canada a second time, this time for the newly formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in the Saskatchewan riding of Mackenzie. He was the first CCF-er to run for federal office. His candidacy was opposed by others on the left, and the United Farmers&#x27;s Unity League ran a candidate against him. Stubbs was also criticized for bringing his personal controversies into the campaign. His religious beliefs were questioned by some (originally an Anglican, Stubbs became a secular humanist in later years). His former ally William Lyon MacKenzie King campaigned against him. Stubbs was defeated by Liberal John Angus MacMillan by 1614 votes.

Notwithstanding this setback, Stubbs ran as an Independent candidate in Manitoba&#x27;s 1936 provincial election. He ran in the riding of Winnipeg, which at the time elected ten members by Single transferable voting. His popular support was massive. He received a record 24,815 votes on the first count, more than three times what was needed to be declared elected and almost 20,000 more than his nearest opponent, Communist James Litterick.

Stubbs was a member of the left-opposition in parliament, opposing the Liberal-Progressive government of John Bracken. Although frequently a political ally of Litterick, he was unwilling to follow political directives from the U.S.S.R. and never entertained the possibility of joining the Communist Party. He supported the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in the Spanish Civil War, and often dismissed the CCF as an ineffective opposition.

There were rumours that Stubbs would run in the 1940 federal election against CCF incumbent MP Abraham Albert Heaps, but he declined in the interests of unity among &quot;progressive&quot; politicians. He was a strong supporter of the full mobilization for Canadian forces in World War II, and condemned the Communist Party&#x27;s volte-face on the issue following the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of October 7, 1939. The CP was declared illegal at this time and Winnipeg CP MLA James Litterick was expelled from the legislature.

The remaining political parties in the Manitoba Legislature (Liberal-Progressive, Conservative, CCF and Social Credit) formed a united coalition ministry. Stubbs labelled the coalition as a monstrosity. He was for a time the only opposition MLA in the assembly. Later two coalition MLAs left the government to sit alongside him.

Stubbs was re-elected in the 1941 election, although without the massive vote totals of previous elections (he finished second on the first count, behind Liberal-Progressive candidate John McDiarmid). After this, Stubbs frequently called for electoral reform in Manitoba, noting that the voters in the province&#x27;s urban centres were under-represented in comparison to voters in the rural districts.

He was asked to run against Stanley Knowles in Winnipeg North Centre in the 1945 federal election, but again declined.

He was re-elected in the 1945 election, but again with diminished support. AS MLA he supported CCF MLA Morris Gray&#x27;s efforts to increase provincial old-age pensions, and again spoke in favour of electoral reform. His efforts resulted in the break-up of the 10-member city district of Winnipeg and its replacement by three four-member districts (although it was not necessary to break up the Winnipeg district to give the city more seats. Some STV elections fill 21 seats at one time.)

Stubbs did not run for re-election in 1949. Perhaps this was because he did not want to be seen to be trying to benefit from the redistricting.

He did run in the next election. He was a candidate in the four-member district of Winnipeg Centre in the 1953 provincial election. The election was held using STV. Stubbs was unsuccessful, placing fifth in the first count and not accumulating enough votes through transfers to overtake those who were more popular.

== Later life ==
He returned to his law practice after leaving political life. Stubbs died on May 12, 1958.

<text>The Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) is a non-profit charitable organization founded on January 29, 1897, and based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was created as a gift for Queen Victoria for the purposes of home care and social services. It is registered as a charity with the Canada Revenue Agency, under charity number 129482493RR0001. Since 2014, the President and CEO is Jo-Anne Poirier.

==History==

Lady Aberdeen, wife of Canadian Governor General Lord Aberdeen, visited Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1896. While there, she heard many stories of women and children alone in remote areas of Canada as their husbands had to travel great distances for medical help. At a meeting of the National Council for Women in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she was asked to create an order of visiting nurses in Canada. It was to be a memorial for the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s ascent to the throne of the British Empire. At Rideau Hall on February 10, 1897, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier hosted an inauguration to create the Victorian Order of Nurses &quot;as a mode of commemoration by the Dominion of Canada (Canada) of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee&quot;. In 1898, the first nurse training program was established for the Victorian Order of Nurses in Ottawa, Ontario.

In 1898, one of the first high-profile projects for the VON was a call to women to join the Victorian Order of Nurses&#x27; Klondike contingent. Candidates had to be unmarried, at least twenty-eight years old, and be a graduate of a recognized nursing school. They were warned they would have to dress very plainly and not curl or crimp their hair. Four nurses were selected, three Canadians and one recent immigrant from England. They reached Dawson one month after the Sisters of Saint Anne and found their skills desperately needed to care for the many victims of the typhoid epidemic that was raging through the Klondike.

The VON has helped Canada through many incidents including World War I, the Halifax Explosion and World War II. More importantly, VON has been an important element of building community, creating opportunities for people to work together to meet their needs and those of their friends and neighbours.

, the VON, as it is almost universally known in Canada, was still the largest single, national homecare organization. With a staff of more than 7,000 supported by more than 14,000 volunteers, they touch the lives of many Canadians daily.

VON Canada is structured into a national service provider and local charities. Both are governed by volunteer Board members. The National Board is composed of dedicated volunteers from across Canada elected by the representatives of the local branches. The local branches operate in each of their communities, raising funds and lobbying to meet specific needs.

On November 25, 2015, VON suddenly shut down all their operations outside of Ontario and Nova Scotia. The order was lacking in funding, and could no longer support operating offices in other areas. It will restructure to determine what services will continue to be offered while being financially viable.

<doc id="1136575" wikidata="Q1638646" url="?curid=1136575" title="Hurricane John (1994)">
<text>Hurricane John, also known as Typhoon John, was the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone ever observed worldwide. It was also the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record globally at the time, until it was surpassed by Cyclone Freddy in 2023. John formed during the 1994 Pacific hurricane season, which had above-average activity due to the El Niño of 1994–1995, and peaked as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, the highest categorization for hurricanes.

Over the course of its existence, John followed a path from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific and back to the central Pacific, lasting 31 days in total. Because it existed in both the eastern and western Pacific, John was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing only minimal effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska.

== Meteorological history ==
The origins of Hurricane John were thought by the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) to be from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 25, 1994. The wave subsequently moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean without distinction, before it crossed Central America and moved into the Eastern Pacific Ocean on or around August 8. Upon entering the Eastern Pacific the wave gradually developed, before the NHC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 11. The system was at this time moving westwards and located around to the south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Quickly developing banding features and well-defined outflow, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named &quot;John&quot; later that day.

A strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away most of the clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 17:00 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a Category 3 major hurricane. Around 11:00 PDT on August 20, John crossed into the central Pacific, the first of three basin crosses John would make.

After entering the central Pacific, John left the area monitored by the NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As the storm moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on August 22, John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . Also, on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.

With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow turn to the north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a small group of islands populated only by a United States military base. The storm slowly weakened from its peak as a Category 5 hurricane in the face of increasing shear, dropping down to a Category 1 hurricane with maximum winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). On August 25 local time, John made its closest approach to the Johnston Atoll only to the north. On Johnston Atoll, sustained winds were reported up to , the equivalent of a strong tropical storm, and gusts up to were recorded.

Clearing Johnston Atoll, John turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 130 mph (215 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and was referred to as Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.

After reentering the central Pacific, John briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90 mph (150 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well to the north of Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John&#x27;s structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately south of Unalaska Island.

=== Records ===

John&#x27;s 31-day existence made it the longest-lasting tropical cyclone recorded in the Pacific Ocean, surpassing Hurricane Tina&#x27;s previous record of 24 days in the 1992 season, and the longest-lived globally on record, surpassing the San Ciriaco hurricane&#x27;s duration of 28 days in the 1899 Atlantic season. John&#x27;s global record stood until 2023, when it was broken by Cyclone Freddy, which traversed the Indian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere for 36 days. 

Additionally, despite its slow movement throughout much of its path, John was also the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone in both the Pacific Ocean and globally, with a distance traveled of , ahead of 2023&#x27;s Cyclone Freddy, with a distance traveled of 12,785 km (7,945 mi), or about 33% of the Earth&#x27;s circumference, outdistancing the previous record of set by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season. In addition, John was the first tropical cyclone on record to become a hurricane in the Eastern Pacific (east of 140°W), traverse the entire Central Pacific at hurricane strength, and then cross into the Western Pacific at the International Date Line (180°W) and become a typhoon, a feat matched only by Hurricane Dora in 2023.

Pressure readings from John&#x27;s peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both hurricanes Emilia and Gilma of 1994, as well as hurricanes Ioke of 2006 and Lane and Walaka of 2018 all recorded lower pressures in the central Pacific. However, all five had lower wind speeds than John. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds.) John was also only the fourth Category 5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994). John also possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, , a record shared with the aforementioned Patsy of 1959. Since 1994, only three Category 5 hurricanes, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 have formed in or entered into the Central Pacific. Despite this however, John&#x27;s pressure record is incomplete; the reading was only measured when the winds were ; there is no pressure estimate for when it had winds of , so it could have been more intense than Emilia, Gilma, Ioke, Lane, or Walaka.

== Impact ==

John affected both the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Atoll, but only lightly. While John passed over to the south of Hawaii, the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast- and south-facing shores, and, while moving westward, on west-facing shores as well. The waves, ranging from in height, flooded beach parks in Kailua-Kona. Additionally, heavy rains on the Big Island of Hawaii caused minor, localized flooding and some short-term road closures. No deaths, injuries or significant damages were reported in Hawaii.

Although John passed within of Johnston Atoll, it had weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by closest approach. Prior to the storm&#x27;s arrival, waves between were reported on the island. Additionally, in the Northern Hemisphere, the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone, so the atoll, which lay to the south of the storm&#x27;s path, was spared the brunt of the storm. Nonetheless, the 1,100-man personnel for the United States military base on Johnston Atoll had been evacuated to Honolulu as a precaution while John approached. Damage to structures was considerable, but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage; monetary losses were estimated at close to $15 million (1994 US$).

In Alaska, the remnants of John moved through the Aleutian Islands, producing a wind gust of in Unalaska. The storm brought a plume of warm air, and two stations recorded a high temperature of .

<doc id="1136577" wikidata="Q3543997" url="?curid=1136577" title="The Demon Ororon">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hakase Mizuki. The manga was licensed in North America by Tokyopop. The epilogue to the series, had six chapters released as of 2007.

==Plot==
When Chiaki meets a wounded young man on the street and offers to take him in, she has no idea that she&#x27;s just invited the King of Hell to move in with her. Out of gratitude for helping him, Ororon offers to grant Chiaki one wish. Chiaki, who lives a very lonely life, asks Ororon to stay with her forever. Remarking that &quot;forever&quot; is not the same for each of them, Ororon agrees, and the two of them quickly become attached to each other. Unfortunately, Chiaki soon realizes that falling in love with a demon has consequences. Ororon has abandoned his throne, causing renegade demons, bounty hunters, and his own brothers to come after him to take his crown. As Ororon fights to stay alive and protect the girl he loves, Chiaki is appalled by the violence surrounding her, and condemns Ororon as a murderer. Their relationship remains strained throughout the series as Ororon attempts to refrain from killing for Chiaki&#x27;s sake, leaving himself open for attack in the process. However, when her friends are threatened Chiaki herself displays a horrifying power. The powers her angelic father sealed within her level an entire city during a battle with several bounty hunters, and Chiaki spends the rest of the series in agony over her hatred of what she and Ororon must do to survive.

==Characters==

===Main===
*Chiaki Saionji is the heroine, a shy and pacifistic girl who is the daughter of the Archangel Michael and a human woman. She is a boyish-looking, extensively cheery 15-year-old girl. Her parents disappeared when she was a baby, and she was raised by her grandfather, who has recently died. Her mixed heritage gives her incredible powers and makes her a target for both angels and demons. When she unlocks her powers she unleashes a devastating explosion that levels the city.
*Ororon Gem Farrell is the King of Hell, but he has abandoned his post and fled to Earth. He is a mysterious figure and is usually seen wearing all black with a smug look plastered on his face. The seventh and youngest son of the previous king, he has no wish to rule Hell and prefers to remain with Chiaki. For her sake he tries to temper his bloodthirsty nature, a constant source of stress on their relationship.

===Secondary===
*Lika is Chiaki&#x27;s best (and only) friend who moves in with her. Shiro asks her if she is in love with Othello, she neither admits it or denies it, and it is also hinted that she has feelings toward Shiro.
*Shiro and Kuro are two demon-cat brothers who are killed by Ororon after they attack Chiaki. At Chiaki&#x27;s pleading, Ororon restores them to life and they are &quot;adopted&quot; by Chiaki.
*Othello is the fifth son of the previous King of Hell, General of the Army of Hell, and one of the most powerful creatures in the multi-verse (at one point he is referred to as one of the top three who can &quot;kill anything and anyone&quot;). He makes a vow to protect Ororon after Ororon tries to convince their father, Ozu, not to have Othello&#x27;s wife (Futaba) executed. Of all Ororon&#x27;s siblings, he is the only one who cares for Ororon. Othello comes to Earth in search of Ororon, and while at first he attempts to convince Ororon to return to Hell, he seems content to remain on Earth with Ororon and Chiaki. He becomes infatuated with the bounty-hunter Mitsume, in whom he sees much of himself. Othello is constantly joking and laughing, but his smile hides a deep inner pain.
*Mitsume is a bounty hunter. Because he was born with a third eye, an &quot;evil eye&quot;, he was mutilated (losing an arm and two fingers) and driven from his village. Since then, he&#x27;s been wandering around as a professional Bounty Hunter. Othello wants him as a plaything, but he remains defiant. Othello repeatedly beats and goads him in an attempt to give him a purpose for living. From then on, Mitsume makes his life&#x27;s goal to train so that he can kill Othello.
*Oscar Farrel is Ororon and Othello&#x27;s half-brother, the third prince, and Ororon&#x27;s chief rival for the throne of Hell. He has a bittersweet disdain/hatred for the king and is very merciless in his actions. He tries to take over the world, starting with hell, and confronts Ororon in the final battle of the series.
*Yotsuba Farrel is Othello&#x27;s son by his late wife, Futaba. He refuses to call Othello &quot;father&quot;, even though Othello asks him to. His relationship with his father seems strained, but relatively normal. He is commander of the 1st battalion of Hell&#x27;s army.
*Miss Lucy is Ororon&#x27;s maid. She is shown to have abnormal strength. It is unknown whether she is human or demon or some other manner of creature.
*Minister Charles Crodel is one of Ororon&#x27;s advisers, and the most important political figure in Hell, tasked with the daily operations of running the kingdom.
*Minister Shinichiro Tachibana is another adviser to Ororon. Tachibana, Charles, and Yotsuba lead the group that follows Othello to Earth in an attempt to convince Ororon to return to Hell.
*Sheila is Ororon&#x27;s mother, who lost her sanity due to an attempted poisoning. She hates Ororon, because he reminds her of his father; King Ozu had Sheila&#x27;s lover, Gem, killed so that she would become his mistress. She tries to kill Ororon, though because he loves her, he visits her regardless.
*Ozu is Ororon&#x27;s father and King of Hell. He chose Ororon as his heir, though Ororon was the youngest son and mistress-born, because of his obsessive love for Sheila.
*Olga is one of the seven princes of Hell, though his age is unknown. He leads an attack on Hell&#x27;s capital city while Oscar attacks Ororon on Earth. Shinichiro Tachibana states that he does so on Oscar&#x27;s command, though it&#x27;s unclear if they are working together. Due to their rivalry, it is unlikely that any of the seven brothers could ever get along well enough to work together.

==Manga==
Shinshokan published the manga&#x27;s 4 &quot;bound volumes&quot; between April 1999 and March 2001. Tokyopop published the manga&#x27;s 4 &quot;bound volumes&quot; between April 6, 2004 and October 12, 2004. Tokyopop compiled the volumes into &quot;The Demon Ororon: The Complete Collection&quot;, which was released on December 18, 2007.

===Volume list===



==Reception==
A reviewer at Pop Shock Culture commended the manga for its balance of &quot;Tarantino-esque ultraviolence&quot; and &quot;shoujo-channeling relationship of the two core protagonists&quot;. Greg Hackmann at Mania.com and IGN&#x27;s A.E. Sparrow criticises the artist for drawing the characters &quot; too similar in appearance&quot;.

<text>Jon Courtenay Grimwood (born 1953 in Valletta, Malta) is a Maltese born British science fiction and fantasy author. He also writes literary fiction as Jonathan Grimwood, and crime fiction and thrillers as Jack Grimwood.

==Biography==
Grimwood was born in Valletta, Malta, grew up in Malta, Britain, Southeast Asia and Norway in the 1960s and 1970s. He studied at Kingston University, then worked in publishing and as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;. Now writing a memoir and studying for a PhD at the University of St Andrews, he lives in Edinburgh and is married to the journalist and novelist Sam Baker, with a son, Jamie, from a previous marriage.

Much of his early work within SF&amp;F has been described as post-cyberpunk. He won a British Science Fiction Association award for &quot;Felaheen&quot; in 2003, was short-listed for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for &quot;Pashazade&quot; the year before, and won the 2006 BSFA award for Best Novel with &quot;End of the World Blues&quot;. He was short-listed for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 2002 for &quot;Pashazade&quot;. His fourth book is loosely based on Stanley Weyman&#x27;s Victorian novel &quot;Under the Red Robe&quot;. &quot;End of the World Blues&quot; was also short-listed for the 2007 Arthur C. Clarke Award.
The following were nominated in the SF novel category in the Locus Awards – &quot;Felaheen, The Third Arabesk&quot; (2004); &quot;Stamping Butterflies&quot; (2005); &quot;9Tail Fox&quot; (2006); &quot;End of the World Blues&quot; (2007).

The French translation of his 2013 literary novel &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, written as Jonathan Grimwood, was shortlisted in January 2015 for , as &#x27;, 2014, &#x27;, translation by Carole Delporte.

Grimwood&#x27;s SF&amp;F work tends to be of a quasi-alternate history genre. In the first four novels, set in the 22nd century, the point of divergence is the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, where Grimwood posits a reality where Napoleon III&#x27;s France defeats Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Prussia, causing the German Empire never to form and the Second French Empire never to collapse. In the &quot;Arabesk&quot; trilogy, the point of divergence is in 1915, with Woodrow Wilson brokering an earlier peace so that World War I barely expanded outside of the Balkans; the books are set in a liberal Islamic Ottoman North Africa in the 21st century, mainly centring on El Iskandriya (Alexandria). By contrast, there is little in &quot;Stamping Butterflies&quot;, &quot;9tail Fox&quot; or &quot;End of the World Blues&quot; to suggest that the books are not set in our reality.

&quot;The Fallen Blade&quot; is the first of three novels set in an alternative early-15th century featuring Tycho, fallen angel and assassin, at the Venetian court, in a Venice where Marco Polo&#x27;s family have been hereditary dukes for five generations and the Mongol emperor Tamberlaine has conquered China, making him the most powerful ruler in the world. The second novel in the Assassini series, &quot;The Outcast Blade&quot; was published in 2012, with the third &quot;The Exiled Blade&quot; published 2013. The novels take as a template sequences and tropes from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The novels have been sold into a number of languages.

His first literary novel, &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, as Jonathan Grimwood, was published in 2013 by Canongate Booksin the UK, Europa Editions in the US, and Éditions Terra Nova in France, among others. Referencing Benjamin Franklin, Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade — and picaresque in the style of Candide — it tells the semi magic realist tale of an aristocrat prepared to eat anything, and covers the run up to the French Revolution from the early to late 18th century. The French France 5 critic Gérard Collard called &quot;Le Dernier Banquet&quot; &quot;&quot; (the book of the year). It was an NPR Best Book of the Year for 2013 &#x27;Foodies and Francophiles alike will relish this debut novel about Jean-Marie d&#x27;Aumout, whom we first meet crunching beetles as a starving orphaned son of nobility in 1723...’ In January 2015, it was shortlisted for Le Prix Montesquieu. The book was also nominated for the Bad Sex Awards for a scene involving Brie and breast milk.

As Jack Grimwood, he is writing thrillers for Penguin Books. The first, Moskva, Spring 2016, is set in 1980s Soviet Moscow. The second, Nightfall Berlin was published in May 2018.

2021’s Island Reich, the first stand-alone novel written as Jack Grimwood, mixes the story of the fictional safe cracker and conman Bill O’Hagan, with the Battle of France in June 1940, the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the Duke of Windsor’s exile in Portugal and Operation Willi, the supposed Nazi plot to kidnap the duke and return him to the British throne as a puppet monarch. 

Midnight Sun, the third Tom Fox novel, is due Summer 2023. 

Grimwood was guest of honour at Novacon in 2003, at Kontext (in Uppsala, Sweden) in 2008, at Eastercon LX (the 60th British National Science Fiction Convention) in 2009, and at Bristolcon in 2014.

He was a judge for the 2010 Arthur C Clarke Award presented to China Miéville for &quot;The City &amp; the City&quot;; and for the 2011 award presented to Lauren Beukes for &quot;Zoo City&quot;. He also judged The James White Award given at Eastercon 2012.

<text>The Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT; ) is a public university in Wuhan, Hubei, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211. 

The university emerged as a result of the merger of three universities in 2000: Wuhan Industrial University (), Wuhan Transportation Technology University (), and Wuhan Automotive Industrial University (). 

== History ==

The origin of the school originated in 1898 when Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Huguang, asked the Qing government to establish Hubei Institution of Technology. Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) was founded on May 27, 2000 from the former Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan Transportation University and Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. Each of these three universities has its own uniquely important history.

The former Wuhan University of Technology dated back from three colleges, namely, Zhongnan Construction Engineering College in 1952, Shenyang Building Materials Industry College in 1958 and Beijing Institute of Building Engineering in 1958. Then in 1971, Beijing Institute of Building Engineering merged with Wuhan Construction Engineering School and thus formed Hubei Construction Industry College. Later in 1978, the college was awarded the title as national key university and then changed its name to Wuhan Institute of Building Materials. In 1985, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Technology, which later passed the evaluation of &quot;State 211 Project&quot; in 1996 and entered into the direct administration of the Ministry of Education in 1998 before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.

The former Wuhan Transportation University mainly originated from National Maritime Vocational School in 1946. Then in 1949, the college changed its name to Wuhan Transportation College. in 1952, the college changed its name to Wuhan River Transportation College. Later in 1957, the college changed its name to Wuhan University of Water Transportation Engineering which then received the discipline adjustment by the Ministry of Transportation in 1963. More importantly, the college merged with Wuhan River Transportation School and thus got its name as Wuhan University of Water Transportation Engineering. Later in 1993, the college was officially named as Wuhan Transportation University by the Ministry of Transportation before its merge with the other two universities in May 2000.

The former Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University came from the original Wuhan Institute of Technology which was founded in 1958. In 1959, it was merged into Hubei Chemical Engineering College. Then in 1961, the college merged with the other two colleges, respectively, Wuhan Institute of Technology and Hubei Industry College and thus named itself Wuhan Institute of Technology. During the next fifteen years, the Institute underwent great changes and was forced to change its name due to China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. Then in 1979, the Institute regained its name as Wuhan Institute of Technology. Later from 1983 to 1994, the Institute showed its rapid development in many aspects. Then in 1995, the Institute changed its name to Wuhan Automotive Polytechnic University. What was more, in 1999, Hubei No.1 Mechanical Industry School and Hubei Energy Economy School were merged into the university. Later in May 2000, it merged with the other two universities mentioned in the beginning and thus formed Wuhan University of Technology.
== Academic ==
Currently, the university owns 23 academic schools, 9 state key disciplines, 74 Doctoral programs, 135 Master&#x27;s programs as well as 82 Bachelor&#x27;s programs. WUT has about 5,570 staff members, including 650 professors, 3 academicians of China Academy of Engineering and 3 academicians of China Academy of Science. Besides, over 36,000 undergraduates, 16000 postgraduates (including Master and PhD students), and 327 international students are studying at WUT.

The university has extensively established academic links with more than sixty external universities and institutions. The university has engaged more than one hundred famous foreign scholars as Concurrent or Honorary Professors for the university, and often receives experts, scholars and professors from other countries or regions to teach or do research. The university also sends abroad a number of teachers, professors, and scholars to study and to attend international academic conferences each year. Some of them have been engaged as Guest Professor, Special Professor or Lecturer by foreign host institutions. In 1950 the university began to admit foreign students and has awarded more than ten different countries’ students ever since with a bachelor, master&#x27;s degree or a certificate for further study.

<doc id="1136583" wikidata="Q527226" url="?curid=1136583" title="Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair">
<text>Ishbel Maria Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, (&quot;née&quot; Isabel Maria Marjoribanks; 15 March 1857 – 18 April 1939) was a British writer, philanthropist, and an advocate of women&#x27;s interests. As the wife of John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, she was viceregal consort of Canada from 1893 to 1898 and of Ireland from 1906 to 1915.

==Early life==
Born in London, Isabel Maria Marjoribanks was the third daughter of the 1st Baron Tweedmouth and Isabella Weir-Hogg (daughter of Sir James Weir Hogg). A sometimes &quot;anxious&quot; child, she had enjoyed escaping to the mansion her father had built amidst the &quot;rugged splendour of Glen Affric&quot; in the Scottish Highlands. She received a well-rounded education in English, French, mathematics, history, and geography, and was such a good student that her teacher recommended she attend college. However, Lady Aberdeen&#x27;s father shared the widely held opinion that university was no place for a woman. Instead, her education continued at home at her parents’ social events, where she met the famous politicians of the day. This experience helped prepare her for a lifetime of political involvement. Isabel became an evangelical at an early age, believing like many Victorians in a life dedicated to good works, as well as social and moral reform.

After a six-year acquaintance, she married John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, the 7th Earl of Aberdeen (later the 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair), on 7 November 1877 in St. George&#x27;s Church, St. George Street, Hanover Square, London. The couple had four surviving children: George (1879), Marjorie (1880), Dudley (1883), and Archibald (1884). Lady Aberdeen&#x27;s daughter has written that &quot;Ishbel interpreted the duty of wife as one who not only provided for her husband a serene background in private life, but as one who also thought and fought for him in all his affairs.&quot;

==Social activism in England and Scotland==
Lord Aberdeen was a Liberal and a member of the House of Lords, and Lady Aberdeen supported him by hosting social events. An intelligent and determined woman, she soon established her own political life as an activist. Because of political obligations, the family divided their time between London and their Scottish estate in Aberdeenshire. They called their home Haddo House, and it was here that Lady Aberdeen began her involvement with social reforms. She organized a Household Club that held classes for servants to learn singing, carving, reading, and other activities. The Aberdeens often attended their servants’ evening socials and meetings, and in London society it was rumoured that they had even dined together. They also funded a local school and hospital—healthcare was a cause that Lady Aberdeen supported throughout her life.

Lady Aberdeen&#x27;s influence also extended beyond her country estate. She established the Onwards and Upward Association, which provided servant girls with postal courses on topics ranging from geography to literature to domestic science. This program spread from Aberdeenshire to include thousands of servants. Lady Aberdeen founded the Aberdeen Ladies&#x27; Union, an institution to help young women in Scotland. In 1883 she became the first president of the Ladies’ Union of Aberdeen, an organization that focused on the well-being of young women living in cities. An Emigration Committee chose suitable women and sponsored them to move to the colonies, especially Canada. Lady Aberdeen was also the head of the Women&#x27;s Liberal Federation, which advocated for women&#x27;s suffrage.

Her commitment to housing improvement and fascination with the work of Octavia Hill is recorded by her daughter Baroness Pentland who wrote in a 1952 biography of her mother: &#x27;In February 1939 she presided at the showing (for the first time outside London) of a centenary exhibition illustrating the life of Hill&#x27;s work which had been brought north and explained by Miss Anne Lupton&#x27;.

==Time in Canada==

In 1893, Lord Aberdeen was appointed the Governor General of Canada, a post he would occupy until 1898. The Aberdeens were no strangers to the country, as they had visited several times before; during their cross-Canada tour of 1890 they had even purchased a homestead in British Columbia. On that same visit they crossed the prairies, and Lady Aberdeen was struck by the difficult and isolated lifestyle of pioneers. She subsequently founded the Aberdeen Association for Distribution of Good Literature to Settlers in the West, which sent settlers packages of books and magazines.

Lady Aberdeen was dedicated to her role as Governor General&#x27;s wife (Viceregal consort of Canada). She hosted many popular social events, such as winter festivals and costume balls, and was more politically involved than her predecessors. She travelled extensively, attending events and collecting information for her husband. She regularly offered him advice, and in fact newspapers commented (sometimes critically) that it appeared she held the power in their relationship.

In 1893, the year she arrived in Canada, Lady Aberdeen was named the first president of the International Council of Women, an organization that campaigns for women&#x27;s rights. Consequently, she organized the National Council of Women of Canada and travelled the country establishing local branches. One of the activists she worked with was Adelaide Hoodless, who went on to found the Women&#x27;s Institute.

Lady Aberdeen was the first sponsor of the Women&#x27;s Art Association of Canada, founded in 1892. Yet another of her endeavours was the May Court Club, an association that enabled well-off young women to do charitable work. A key organization that she helped establish is the Victorian Order of Nurses, which aimed to give women better training and a higher salary so they could provide services to rural and disadvantaged populations. Lady Aberdeen and the group&#x27;s supporters had to overcome resistance from the medical community before receiving the organization&#x27;s royal charter in 1898. That same year, Lord and Lady Aberdeen returned to England.

==Time in Ireland==
Lord Aberdeen belonged to the Liberal Party, and when it regained power in parliament in 1906 he was named the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for the second time. He had previously been Lord Lieutenant, or viceroy, for approximately six months in 1886. True to her nature, Lady Aberdeen identified herself with the cause of the Irish people and contributed to Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s success over the course of his six months in office. During that time, Lady Aberdeen had promoted Irish crafts and became chairman of the Association of Irish Industries. 

Their second term in Ireland lasted from 1906 to 1915, and this time she focused on healthcare and social well-being. Lady Aberdeen was involved with medical organizations like the Women&#x27;s National Health Association of Ireland that were dedicated to treating and preventing tuberculosis and improving children&#x27;s health. Her name lives on in Lady Ishbel Avenue, part of the former Purdysburn Fever Hospital site in south Belfast.

In 1911 she served as the first president of the Housing and Town Planning Association of Ireland, advocating for better housing and public spaces to address the prevalent poverty. Lady Aberdeen&#x27;s Cottages in Mullingar are named after her. Although she had been quite popular during her first stint in Ireland, she faced a different reception upon her return.

By 1906 nationalist sentiment had increased significantly in Ireland, and her ties to Britain were held against her. Furthermore, her determination to have her way meant that she was not always sensitive to the Irish perspective.

==Later life==

Lord and Lady Aberdeen retired to their home in Scotland, but continued to be involved in social causes. Together they wrote a memoir, &quot;We Twa&quot;, that was published in 1925 to a positive reception and was followed by several expanded editions. &quot;The Canadian Journal of Lady Aberdeen, 1893–1898&quot;, was edited by John Saywell and published by the Champlain Society in 1960, after her death. 

In 1931, Lady Aberdeen presented to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland a petition of 336 women calling for women to be ordained to the ministry, diaconate and eldership of the Kirk. This resulted in a special commission, which recommended only that women should be ordained to the diaconate. It was not until 1968 that the Church of Scotland passed acts allowing women to become elders or enter the ministry. She continued to serve as the president of the International Council of Women until 1936. She died of a heart attack on 18 April 1939 at Gordon House in Rubislaw, Aberdeen.

==Recognition==

In 1894, she received the Freedom of Limerick; she received the Freedom of Edinburgh in 1928 and was invested Dame Grand Cross in the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1931.

The Lady-Aberdeen Bridge, which is the first bridge upstream to cross the Gatineau River, in Gatineau, Quebec, was renamed in her honour. After falling through the ice at the confluence of the Gatineau and Ottawa Rivers, Lady Aberdeen was rescued by locals.

Lady Aberdeen is credited with introducing the Golden Retriever to Canada; her father, Sir Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, a Scottish aristocrat, is best known as the originator of the breed.

Aberdeen Avenue in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, was named after Lord and Lady Aberdeen who lived on Bay Street South between 1890 and 1898. They presided over the opening of the &quot;Hamilton Public Library&quot; on 16 September 1890. Aberdeen Avenue in Toronto is also named after them. Aberdeen Street in Kingston, Ontario, is named for the couple; it is located near the Queen&#x27;s University campus. Her popularity in Canada led to her being given 18 elaborate tea sets by the Canadian government. This gift was nothing to do with her title or marriage and was purely because of her own work and impact. 

She was the first woman to be made an honorary member of the British Medical Association.

The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a plaque for Lady Aberdeen 1857–1939 on the grounds of Rideau Hall, 1 Sussex Drive, Ottawa. &quot;Widely respected for her organizational skills and strong commitment to public service, Lady Aberdeen served as president of the International Council of Women from 1893 to 1939. During the Earl of Aberdeen&#x27;s term as governor-general, she helped to form the National Council of Women of Canada.&quot; Lady Aberdeen was also named a National Historic Person with a plaque on Sussex Drive in Ottawa.
Robert Gordon University has a campus building on its Garthdee campus named after her.

<text>The Perfect Matrimony or The Door to Enter Into Initiation is the first of approximately seventy books written by Samael Aun Weor. It was first published in 1950 then revised and expanded in 1961.

It describes the esoteric teachings of alchemy, tantra, kabbalah, the mysteries of the Maya, Aztecs, ancient Egyptians, Tibetans, and Essenes, among others. The sexual aspect of religion is stressed in every religion it covers, stating bluntly that &quot;the topic of this book is exclusively Sexual Magic.&quot;
Sexual magic is explained as the synthesis of all religion. From the introduction of the 1960 edition:

The author presents a wide selection of religion and mystery schools from esoteric viewpoints, highlighting data traditionally thought to be unimportant, or otherwise understood in an unrelated manner. The primary message is that upright sexuality, exemplified through sexual magic, is the cornerstone upon which all authentic religion, yoga and occultism is based.

&quot;The Perfect Matrimony&quot; is a discourse on how to transform the sexual energy into its superior aspects via sexual transmutation. It states that there are three types of Sexual Magic, or Tantra: Black, Grey, and White. Black Tantra involves the ejaculation of semen, and Grey Tantra sometimes concludes with orgasm or ejaculation, while White Tantra always opposes any loss of sexual energy whatsoever, in other words, without orgasm or ejaculation. It exclusively advocates White Tantra as the path to achieve &quot;self-realization&quot; and to &quot;achieve cosmic consciousness.&quot; This system of classification is not found in any of the traditional Tantric texts; however, it is also true that tantra yoga has been historically &quot;gupta vidya&quot;, or esoteric knowledge not contained in books.

Sexual magic is explained to be the same as maithuna, sexual yoga, urdhvareta yoga.

&quot;The Perfect Matrimony&quot; also states that Jesus was married and practiced sexual yoga with his wife.

<text>American and Canadian football are gridiron codes of football that are very similar; both have their origins partly in rugby football, but some key differences exist between the two codes.

==History==

Rugby football was introduced to North America in Canada by the British Army garrison in Montreal, which played a series of games with McGill University. In 1874, the United States&#x27; Harvard University hosted Canada&#x27;s McGill University to play the new game derived from rugby football in a home-and-home series.

When the Canadians arrived several days early, to take advantage of the trip to see Boston and the surrounding areas, they held daily practices. During this time, the Americans were surprised to see the Canadians kick, chase, and then run with the ball. Picking up and running with the ball violated a basic rule of the American game of the day; when the U.S. captain (Henry Grant) pointed this out to the captain of the Canadian team (David Roger), the reply was simple: Running with the ball is a core part of the Canadian game. When the American asked which game the Canadians played, David replied &quot;rugby&quot;. After some negotiation, they decided to play a game with half and half Canadian/U.S. rules. Thus, many of the similarities and differences between the Canadian and American games indeed came out of this original series where each home team set the rules. For instance, Harvard, because of a lack of campus space, did not have a full-sized rugby pitch. Their pitch was only long by wide (slightly less than the -yard width of the current regulation-sized field for American football).

Because of the reduced field, the Harvard team opted for 11 players per side, four fewer than the regulation 15 of rugby union. To generate more offense, Harvard also increased the number of downs from three, as set by McGill, to four. Furthermore, the Harvard players so enjoyed running with the ball, this rule was wholly adopted into all Harvard play following the two games with McGill. While the American team bested the Canadian (3–0 and a following tie game), both countries&#x27; flavours of football were forever changed and linked to one another. Both the Canadian and American games still have some things in common with the two varieties of rugby, especially rugby league, and because of the similarities, the National Football League (NFL) had a formal relationship with the Canadian Football League (CFL) between 1997 and 2008.

Many, if perhaps not most, of the rules differences have arisen because of rules changes in American football in the early 20th century, which have not been copied by Canadian football. The major Canadian codes never abolished the onside scrimmage kick (see Kicker advancing the ball below) or restricted backfield motion, while the American college football (from whose code all American codes derive) did. Canadian football was later in adopting the hand snap and the forward pass, although one would not suspect the latter from play today. Additionally, Canadian football was slower in removing restrictions on blocking, but caught up by the 1970s so that no significant differences remain today. Similarly, differences in scoring (the Canadian game valuing touchdowns less) opened up from the late 19th century, but were erased by the 1950s. An area in which American football has been more conservative is the retention of the fair catch (&quot;see below&quot;). The American game&#x27;s modern rules were developed by Walter Camp in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whereas the modern Canadian game was devised by John Thrift Meldrum Burnside, whose Burnside rules, invented around the same time, were developed independently from Camp&#x27;s rules.

In some regions along the Canada-U.S. border, especially western areas, some high schools from opposite sides of the border regularly play games against one another (typically one or two per team per season). By agreement between the governing bodies involved, the field of the home team is considered a legal field, although it is a different size from one school&#x27;s normal field. In all but a few cases, the rules of the home team are followed throughout the game.

Many CFL players are Americans who grew up playing American football and cannot find a place in the NFL, or who prefer to play in the CFL; strict import quotas restrict the number of non-Canadian players. Furthermore, the classifications of import (non-Canadian) and non-import (Canadian) were highly restrictive and required a player to have been in Canada since childhood to qualify as a nonimport (i.e. a player cannot simply become a Canadian citizen and become a nonimport, nor can he arrive in Canada during high school or college; both scenarios would still have the player in question classified as an import and counted against the team&#x27;s maximum); these restrictions were loosened beginning in 2014 so that anyone who had become a Canadian citizen at any time before signing with the league for the first time could qualify as a nonimport player. For individuals who played both American and Canadian football professionally, their career statistic totals are considered to be their combined totals from their careers in both the CFL and NFL. Warren Moon, for example, was the all-time professional football leader in passing yards after an illustrious career in both leagues. He was surpassed in 2006 by Damon Allen, who in turn was surpassed by Anthony Calvillo in 2011, both of whose careers were exclusively in the CFL, then Calvillo was surpassed by Drew Brees and Tom Brady, both of whom played their entire careers in the NFL.

==Differences==
Several important specific differences exist between the Canadian and American versions of the game of football:

===Playing area===
The official playing field in Canadian football is larger than the American, and similar to American fields before 1912. The Canadian field of play is , compared to in American football.

Since 1986, Canadian end zones are deep while the American end zones are deep. Canadian end zones were previously , with Vancouver&#x27;s BC Place the first to use the 20-yard-long end zone in 1983, and since 2016, the home of the CFL&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts, BMO Field, uses an end zone. Including the end zones, the American field is about 34% smaller than the Canadian field ( for the Canadian field vs for the American field), but the Canadian field occasionally has its end zone truncated at the corners so that the field fits in the infield of a running track. Once a fairly common practice, the only example in the CFL is the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes. In contrast, the smaller American regulation field easily fits within a running track, although today such dual use of facilities is only common for high school football and the lower levels of college football. The most recent example of an NFL team using a stadium also used for track and field was the Los Angeles Rams, who played at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after returning to the Los Angeles metropolitan area while SoFi Stadium was being built.

The goalposts for kicking are placed at the goal line in Canadian football, but at the end line in the American game professionally since 1974 (the college game has had them at the end line since 1927). In Canadian rules, the distance between the sideline and hash marks is ; in 2022, the CFL narrowed the hash mark spacing to . In American amateur rules, at the high school level, the distance is , sectioning the field into three almost equal columns. The hash marks are closer together at the American college level, where they are from the sideline, and in the NFL, where they are from the sideline and the distance between them is the same as that between the goalposts.

Because of the larger field, many American football venues are generally unfit for the Canadian game. While several American stadia could accommodate the extra  feet () per side in width (multipurpose stadia, baseball parks converted for football, and some soccer-specific stadiums are particularly good fits), most American stadia would lose between 15 and 18 rows of seating in each end zone because the field is longer on each end. In many smaller venues, this would be the entire end zone section, losing seating for at least 3,000 spectators.

During the CFL&#x27;s failed expansion to U.S. cities in the early 1990s, Canadian football was either played on fields designed to accommodate both American football and baseball (such as the Baltimore Stallions playing at Memorial Stadium), or in some cases, on a field designed for American football (for instance, the Memphis Mad Dogs and the Birmingham Barracudas of the CFL, playing in the Liberty Bowl and at Legion Field, respectively, played the Canadian game on modified American-sized fields because of the inability of the stadia to adapt to the larger field). The Alamodome, originally built as a multipurpose dome, proved to best accommodate both Canadian football (the CFL&#x27;s San Antonio Texans) and American football (Alamo Bowl, Dallas Cowboys training camp, the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina, the NFLPA Game, the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, and the UTSA Roadrunners), although Canadian football is no longer played there. Similarly, Hornet Stadium fairly easily adapted to both the Canadian and American games, as it was built with a running track in which the Canadian field fits with only some cuts to the corners. Hornet Stadium hosts California State University, Sacramento (more often known as Sacramento State), hosted the Sacramento Surge and Sacramento Mountain Lions in American football and the Sacramento Gold Miners in Canadian football.

===Team size===

American teams use 11 players, while Canadian teams have 12 players on the field per side. Both games have the same number of offensive players required at the line of scrimmage, so the 12th player in the Canadian game plays a backfield position on offence, whereas this is usually a defensive back on defence.

Because of this, position designations of the various offensive and defensive lines vary. For example, most formations in Canadian football have no tight ends, these having been phased out in 1980. The typical offensive arrangement in Canadian football is three slotbacks instead of the American tight end and fullback while on the defensive end of the ball, two defensive halfbacks are used instead of one strong safety in the American game.

===The ball===
The sizes of individual American and Canadian footballs can vary within specified size limitations. Despite the CFL and NFL having different specifications until 2018, they overlapped to a sufficient degree that from at least 1985 forward, the same ball could fall within the requirements of both leagues.

Historically the CFL ball was slightly larger, both because of slightly bigger specifications, but also because CFL manufacturers tended to make balls at the larger end of the allowed tolerances as opposed to NFL manufacturers, which built balls to the smaller end. However, the CFL has updated its specifications twice—first in 1985, and most recently in 2018. The latter change saw the league adopt the NFL&#x27;s specifications.

Before it adopted NFL standards, the CFL&#x27;s regulation football size was specified as short circumference from ; long circumference from .

The regulation size for an NFL football is specified as short circumference from ; long circumference from .

Despite the fact that before 2018, the CFL rules allowed for a smaller legal ball and the NFL rules allowed for a larger legal ball, a common misconception existed among media, fans, and even players that the then-current CFL ball was bigger. Some professional quarterbacks stated that they noticed a difference in size.

Another difference between NFL and CFL balls is that Canadian balls have two complete white stripes around the football from the largest diameter of the ball and NFL balls have no stripes at all. The CFL retained its striping scheme when it adopted NFL measurement specifications in 2018. College football and high school football both specify the use of stripes, but only on two of the football&#x27;s four panels (the ones adjacent to the laces).

The original reason for adopting striped balls was to make them easier to see at night in an era when stadium lighting standards were far less rigorous compared to today. Because the CFL and it antecedent competitions historically played twice a week on a regular basis, they played on weekdays far more frequently, these games typically being played in the evening. In contrast, the NFL played the vast majority of its games during the day in this era. Nevertheless, the NFL also intermittently used striped balls until the 1970&#x27;s, including for one Super Bowl (Super Bowl VIII).

===Number of downs===

In American football, a team has four downs to advance the ball 10 yards, while in Canadian football the limit is three downs. On the surface, this creates a considerable handicap for a Canadian football offence. However, most other rule differences as described below strongly favor the defense in the American game.

===Scrimmage===

In both games, the ball is placed at a line of scrimmage, in which a player known as the &quot;centre&quot; or &quot;center&quot; performs a &quot;snap&quot; to start a football play. In Canadian football, the snap is required to go between the centre&#x27;s legs; this is not required in American football, but it is almost always done this way anyway, so the center is in position to block following the snap. The defensive team must stay a set distance away from the line of scrimmage on their side of the line.

In Canadian football, the distance between the line of scrimmage and the defensive team, formally called the &quot;scrimmage zone&quot;, is one full yard. In American football, the set distance between the offensive and defensive teams, known in that code as the &quot;neutral zone&quot;, is 11 inches – the length of the ball, creating the illusion of the teams being &quot;nose-to-nose&quot; against each other. Because of the greater distance in Canadian football, its teams are more likely to gamble at a greater distance on &quot;third and one&quot; or &quot;third and inches.&quot;

If a Canadian football team&#x27;s offense is deemed to be within one yard of either goal line, the line of scrimmage is moved to the one-yard line. No such rule exists in American football.

While large, relatively immobile offensive line players used to form a line that cannot be easily penetrated by the defense are valued in American football, the extra distance from the defensive team means Canadian football finds value in more nimble players on the offensive line.

===Fair catches and punt returns===

In American football, if a punt returner sees that, in his judgment, he will be unable to advance the ball after catching it, he may signal for a fair catch by waving his hand in the air, and forgo the attempt to advance. If he makes this signal, the opposing team must allow him to attempt to catch the ball cleanly; if he is interfered with, the team covering the kick will be penalized 15 yards. In contrast, Canadian football has no such rule; instead, no player from the kicking team, except the kicker or any player who was behind him when he kicked the ball, may approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by an opponent. If they do, a &quot;no yards&quot; penalty is called against the kicking team.

Furthermore, in American football, the receiving team may elect not to play the ball if the prospects for a return are not good and the returner is not certain he can successfully catch the ball on the fly; American players are generally taught not to attempt to touch a bouncing football. If any member of the kicking team touches the ball after the kick is made, without an intervening touch by the member of the receiving team, the receiving team may elect to scrimmage the ball from that spot of first touching, regardless of anything else (other than a penalty) that happens during the rest of the play. If the kicking team gains possession of the ball during the kick before it is touched by the receiving team, the ball is then dead. Often, the ball hits the ground and is surrounded by players from the kicking team, who allow it to roll as far as possible downfield without going into the end zone before grasping or holding the ball against the ground. (If a punt bounces into the receiving team&#x27;s end zone, it is dead, and a touchback is awarded.) However, if the ball touches a member of the receiving team without his gaining possession (a &quot;muff&quot;), then the ball can be recovered by either team (but cannot be advanced by the kicking team). If the kicking team recovers the ball, they regain possession and are awarded a first down at the spot of the recovery.

Following a fair catch in American football, the receiving team can elect a free kick (called a fair catch kick) from the spot the ball is received and if the kick goes through the opposite goal posts, a field goal is scored. Fair catch kicks are rarely attempted in the NFL and are usually unsuccessful (between the last successful fair catch kick in 2024 and the previous one in 1976, there were eight unsuccessful attempts). The fair catch kick is not allowed in college football.

In Canadian football, if the receiving team does not play the ball, the kicker, and any teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick, can retrieve and advance the ball. This is further explained in the kicker advancing the ball section.

===Motion at the snap===

In American football, after all players are set, only one offensive player is allowed to be in motion, and he cannot be moving toward the line of scrimmage while the ball is snapped. The motion player must start from behind the line of scrimmage; players on the line cannot be in motion.

In Canadian football, all offensive backfield players, except the quarterback, may be in motion at the snap; players in motion may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. In addition, the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage (generally wide receivers) may also be in motion along the line. Many teams encourage this unlimited motion, as it can confuse the defence. It also provides receivers the advantage of a running start, as they can time their runs so that they cross the line of scrimmage at speed when the ball is snapped, allowing them to get downfield faster than receivers in American football, allowing for comparatively longer throws in the same amount of time after the snap or quicker throws for a given distance.

===Time rules===

In American football, the offensive team must run a play within 25 seconds of the referee whistling the play in – except in the NCAA (college) and the NFL where teams have 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, or 25 seconds following a penalty or timeout. In Canadian football (at all levels of play), teams have 20 seconds after the play is whistled in regardless of the preceding situation.

American football rules allow each team to have three timeouts in each half, and the NCAA, NFL &amp; Texas high school football stops play for a &quot;two-minute warning&quot;. Before 2024, NCAA football had no two-minute warning, so the clock stopped on a first down until the ball is ready for play if the play ended in the field of play. In Canadian football, each team has two timeouts per game, but in the CFL, a team cannot use both in the last three minutes of the game.

Canadian football has a three-minute whereas American football has a two-minute warning. In both codes, the respective warning amounts to an extra time-out, with the clock being stopped either at the requisite time when running between plays or immediately upon conclusion of a play when the clock reaches or passes this point. Also, at all levels of Canadian football, the clock is stopped after every play during the last three minutes of each half. Once the referee has set the ball, the clock restarts if the last play ended with a runner tackled in the field of play.

Timing rules change drastically after the minutes warning in both leagues:
* In American football, the clock continues to run after any tackle in bounds, but stops after an incomplete pass or a tackle out of bounds. If the clock stops, it is restarted at the snap of the ball or when the ball is ready to be played. In Canadian football, the clock stops after every play, but the starting time differs depending on the result of the previous play: After a tackle in bounds, the clock restarts when the referee whistles the ball in; after an incomplete pass or a tackle out of bounds, the clock restarts when the ball is snapped. In the NCAA, the clock stops after a first down within the last two minutes of each half to move and set the down markers, after which the clock restarts.
* The penalty for allowing the play clock to run out, which is 5 yards with no loss of down before the minutes warning in both codes, dramatically diverges after that point. In American football, the penalty for &quot;delay of game&quot; remains 5 yards with the down repeated. In Canadian football, the penalty for a &quot;time count&quot; violation (&quot;delay of game&quot; is a different violation in Canada) is loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards with the down repeated on third down. Also, if the referee deems a time count violation on third down after the three-minute warning to be deliberate, he has the right to require the offensive team to legally put the ball into play within the 20-second count, with a violation resulting in loss of possession. (Note that the enforcement of time count during convert attempts does not change at the warning; it is 5 yards with the down repeated throughout the game.)
* In American football, a period generally ends when time expires (though any play which is in progress when the clock reaches 0:00 is allowed to finish); in Canadian football, the period must end with a final play. Consequently, a play will be run in Canadian football with no time (0:00) showing on the game clock, provided there was still time remaining when the previous play ended (i.e. as in American football the period will end upon the conclusion of any play, barring a penalty, if time expires &quot;during&quot; that play). American football typically only has a play start with no time on the clock when a defensive penalty occurs during the last play of the period and the penalty is not declined (or, in the NFL, in the very rare circumstance when a team takes a fair catch as time expires and elects a free kick). Additionally, any period in Canadian football cannot end on any accepted penalty (this is not the case in American football), so any such penalty that occurs with 0:00 left in Canada extends the period by at least one more play (these differences do not apply if the penalty in question is &quot;declined&quot; by the non-offending team).

These timing differences, combined with the fewer downs available for the Canadian offence to earn a first down, lead to spectacularly different end games if the team leading the game has the ball. In American football, if the other team is out of timeouts, running 120 seconds (two minutes) off the clock without gaining a first down is possible (the two-minute warning, since it stops the clock, effectively makes it impossible to run off any additional time without gaining a first down). In Canadian football, just over 40 seconds can be run off, and thus its three minute warning is of comparatively much less importance.

===Kicker advancing the ball===

Canadian football retains much more liberal rules regarding recovery of the ball by members of the kicking team. On any kick, the kicker and any member of the kicker&#x27;s team behind the kicker at the time of the kick may recover and advance the ball. On a kickoff, since every member of the kicking team must be behind the ball when it is kicked, this effectively makes all 12 players &quot;onside&quot; and eligible to recover the kick, once it has gone 10 yards downfield. For a punt or missed field goal, usually only the kicker is onside, except in designed onside kick plays. All of the players offside at the time of the kick may neither touch the ball nor be within 5 yards of the member of the receiving team who fields the kick; violation of this rule is a penalty for &quot;no yards&quot;. The penalty for no yards is 15 yards if the kick is in flight and 5 yards if it has been grounded. If such a kick is recovered beyond the line of scrimmage by the kicking team, it is automatically a first down.

The American rules are similar for the recovery of kickoffs. Any member of the kicking team may recover the ball once it has touched an opponent or once it has gone 10 yards downfield and touched the ground. The ball is dead when recovered, though the kicking team is awarded possession at the spot of recovery.

The American rules differ from the Canadian ones for scrimmage kicks. In American rules, to recover a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal) and retain possession, the ball must be touched beyond the line of scrimmage by a member of the receiving team (defense). If the ball is touched by the receiving team and then recovered by the kicking team, the kicking team retains possession and is awarded a first down. If the receiving team has not touched the ball before the kicking team touches it, it is &quot;first touching&quot; as described above in fair catches and punt returns.

Additionally, members of the kicking team must allow the receiving team the opportunity to catch a scrimmage kick in flight. No distance is required; the NCAA revoked its rule of a 2-yard halo.
Once the scrimmage kick has touched the ground, the kicking team is free to recover, subject to the first touching rules.

In both codes, a scrimmage kick that is blocked and recovered by the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage is in play. The kicking team may then choose to either attempt another kick or try to advance the ball, but no turnover has taken place on the play (unless a member of the receiving team has control of the ball), and therefore, the kicking team either has to advance the ball to the first-down marker, or loses the down, which often results in a turnover on downs.

===Fumbles out of bounds===

In Canadian play, if the ball is fumbled out of bounds, the play ends with possession going to the team to last contact the ball in bounds (after the ball has completely left the possession of the fumbling ball carrier). A loose ball may be kicked forward (dribbled) provided it is then recovered by a player who is onside at the time of said kick. The ball may not, however, be intentionally kicked out of bounds to gain possession, this is then treated as a scrimmage kick out of bounds and possession goes to the opposing team. Incidental contact with the foot does not count as kicking the ball out of bounds. In American play, when a ball is fumbled out of bounds, the last team to have clear possession of the football is awarded possession, unless the ball goes out of the back or side of the end zone.

A team may still lose possession after a fumble out of bounds if the fumble occurred on fourth down (third down in Canadian play) and the ball becomes dead short of the line to gain. Because of plays like the Holy Roller, the NFL changed its rule regarding advancing a fumbled ball on offense. If the offensive team fumbles in the last two minutes of either half, or on fourth down at any time, only the player who fumbled is allowed to advance the ball past the point of the fumble. If any other offensive player advances the ball toward the opponent&#x27;s goal line, the ball is moved back to the spot of the fumble. If the fumble occurred on fourth down, the defensive team gains possession on downs unless the original fumble occurred after the line to gain had been reached.

===Field goals, singles, and touchbacks===
In Canadian football, any kick that goes into the end zone is a live ball, except for a successful field goal or if the goalposts are hit while the ball is in flight. If the player receiving the kick fails to return it out of the end zone, or if the ball was kicked through the end zone, then the kicking team scores a single point (rouge), and the returning team scrimmages from its 35-yard line or, if the rouge is scored as a result of a missed field goal attempt, the receiving team may choose the last point of scrimmage. If a kicked ball in flight hits a post without scoring a field goal, there is no score, and the receiving team scrimmages from its 30-yard line. If the kick is returned out of the end zone, the receiving team next scrimmages from the place that was reached (or if they reach the opponents&#x27; goal line, they score a touchdown); in the amateur levels of the game, they are given the ball at their 20-yard line if the kick was not returned that far.

Singles like this do not exist in American football; however, one point may be scored when a safety is scored during a conversion attempt, in contrast to the two points scored for safeties during other plays.

American football also allows a defending team to advance a missed field goal; however, because of the absence of singles and the goalpost position at the back of the end zone, the return is rarely exercised, except on a blocked kick, or as time expires in the half or in the game (with a famous example being Chris Davis&#x27; game-ending return of a missed field goal for the winning touchdown in the 2013 Alabama–Auburn game). Most teams instead elect not to attempt a return and assume possession – at the previous line of scrimmage in the NCAA and at the spot of the kick in the NFL. Since the goalpost is out of bounds, any nonscoring kick that strikes the goalpost is dead, and the receiving team takes over possession from the spot of the kick or their own 20-yard line, whichever is further from the receiving team&#x27;s goal. Likewise, any kickoff or punt that either is kicked through the end zone, is kicked into the end zone and rolls out of bounds without being touched by a player, is touched in the end zone by a member of the kicking team without any member of the receiving team having touched it, or is downed in the end zone by a member of the receiving team, results in a touchback. The placement of the ball after a touchback varies by rule set and game situation. Under high school rules, the receiving team is awarded possession on its own 20-yard line in all situations. In the NCAA and NFL, the ball is moved to the 20-yard line following a punt, and to the 25-yard line following a kickoff, or free kick after a safety. Under NCAA and NFL rules, a kickoff or free kick after a safety that ends in a fair catch by the receiving team inside its own 25-yard line is treated as a touchback, with the ball moved to the 25. If a player of the receiving team fields a kickoff or punt in the end zone, he has the option to down it in the end zone (resulting in a touchback) or to try to advance the ball.

Following a successful field goal, in Canadian rules, the team scored upon has the option of receiving a kickoff, kicking off from its 35-yard line, or scrimmaging at its own 35-yard line (the CFL first instituted this rule in 1975, but eliminated this last option for the 2009 season, but it was reinstated for 2010). [Some confusion as to whether this rule after field goals was changed again in 2019]. In American football, a kickoff is performed by the scoring team after every score, with the exception of safeties. The option for the scored-upon team to kick off after a touchdown exists in American amateur football, but it is very rarely exercised.

====Open-field kick====

Canadian football retains the open-field kick as a legal play, allowing a kick to be taken from anywhere on the field. The open-field kick may be used as a desperation last play by the offense; realizing they are unable to go the length of the field, they advance part of the way and punt the ball in an attempt to recover an onside kick for a touchdown, or into or through the end zone for a single, or attempt a drop kick so as to score a field goal. Like a punt or missed field goal, the team receiving the kick is allowed a 5-yard buffer to recover the kick.

Conversely, the defence, facing a last-second field goal attempt in a tie game or game they lead by one point, often positions its punter and place-kicker in the end zone. If the field goal is missed, they can punt the ball back into the field of play and not concede a single. Multiple such kicks may be attempted on the same play. During the October 29, 2010, Toronto Argonauts game against the Montreal Alouettes, four kicks occurred in one play; after a Montreal missed field goal, the Argonauts punted from the end zone to about the 20-yard line. The ball was caught and immediately punted back to the end zone by Montreal to attempt a single, and finally the Argos punted, but failed to kick it out of the end zone, where the Alouettes recovered it for a touchdown. 

American football only allows free kicks and scrimmage kicks made from behind the line of scrimmage; any kick beyond the line of scrimmage or after change of possession would result in a penalty. (Some levels of American football allow the rare fair catch kick, which according to the NFL rules is neither a free kick nor scrimmage kick, but &quot;sui generis&quot;.)

===Safeties===

In both American and Canadian football, a safety (or safety touch) awards two points to the defending team if the offensive team is brought down in their end zone. In American football, the team giving up the safety must take a &quot;free kick&quot; from their own 20-yard line. In Canadian football, the team being awarded the two points has the option of scrimmaging from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their own 35-yard line, or having the opposing team kick off the ball from their own 35-yard line. In 2009, the CFL changed the last option to be a kick-off from their own 25-yard line.

===Points after touchdown===

In both games, after a touchdown is scored, the scoring team may then attempt one play for additional points. In Canadian football, this play is called a &quot;convert&quot;, and in American football, it is formally called a try or attempt, although it is more commonly referred to as either a conversion, extra point, or point after touchdown (PAT). The additional points may be earned through a kick or a play from scrimmage. If done via kick, the scoring team gains one point, and if done from a scrimmage, the scoring team gains two.

However, the position of the ball for attempts is different in the two games. Point-after-touchdown attempts are snapped from the following points (as of the 2015 season):.
* NFL: 15-yard line for placekick attempts (for a 33-yard attempt), 2-yard line for two-point conversion attempts
* Amateur American football (all levels): 3-yard line for all attempts
* CFL: 25-yard line for placekick attempts (for a 32-yard attempt), 3-yard line for two-point conversion attempts
* Amateur Canadian football (all levels): 5-yard line for all attempts

Because the goalposts are on the goal line in Canada and the end line in the United States, a CFL kicker is at the same distance from the goalposts as an NFL kicker. Before the 2015 CFL season, that league used the 5-yard line for all attempts (for a 12-yard attempt), which meant that the Canadian kicker was closer to the goalposts than an American kicker at any level. Amateur Canadian kickers remain closer to their goalposts than their American counterparts. Also prior to 2015, the NFL&#x27;s line of scrimmage for extra points was the 2-yard line (for a 20-yard attempt). In the American game, a small hashmark is denoted on the field of the line of scrimmage of an extra point kick in the middle of the 3-yard line in high/school college football; in the NFL, this hashmark appeared in the middle of the 2-yard line; while as aforementioned, the line of scrimmage of the extra point kick was moved back in 2015, this hashmark still denotes the 2-point conversion&#x27;s line of scrimmage. No such hashmark appears on the Canadian field.

According to the rules of both the NFL and NCAA, on conversion attempts, the ball is automatically spotted in the middle of the field at the appropriate scrimmage line unless a member of the kicking team expressly asks a referee for an alternative placement. Per the rules, the ball can be placed at another spot between the hash marks (especially for strategic positioning on a two-point conversion attempt) or at another spot further back from the 2-, 3-, or 15-yard line (not uncommon at lower levels of football, since as the season progresses, conditions may worsen toward the center of the field, especially at the spot from which the PAT is usually kicked; the kicker may thus request a spot where the footing is surer).

During conversions, the ball is considered live in the CFL, American collegiate football, Texas high schools, the now-defunct NFL Europa, and starting with the 2015 season the NFL itself. As such, this allows the defensive team to gain two points on an interception or fumble return should they reach the kicking team&#x27;s end zone, or (in the CFL) one point should the defensive team make an open-field drop kick through the kicking team&#x27;s goalposts. Conversely, in other levels of American football and amateur Canadian football, defensive teams cannot score during a try.

A small plastic tee, which can be high (smaller than the kickoff tee), may be used for field goals and extra points in some leagues, including U.S. high schools and Canadian amateur play. The NFL (and most other professional leagues) has never allowed the use of tees for extra-point kick attempts, having always required kickers to kick off the ground for such attempts (and for field goals; a rare exception for a U.S.-based pro league to allow the usage of such tees for such attempts was the original USFL in the 1980s). In 1948, the NCAA authorized the use of the small rubberized kicking tee for extra points and field goals, but banned them by 1989, requiring kicks from the ground, as in the NFL. The CFL allows the use of a tee for field goals and convert kicks, but it is optional.

===Runner down===

In Canadian amateur football, the ball is not dead if a player kneels momentarily to, and does, recover a rolling snap, onside/lateral pass, or opponent&#x27;s kick, while in American amateur football, such a situation produces a dead ball, unless the player is the holder for a place kick. The holder is allowed to catch the snap or recover a rolling snap while on a knee to hold the kick and may also rise to catch a high snap and immediately return to a knee.

At professional levels in both games, unless it is a clearly willful kneel or slide by a ball carrier to go down, a player must be touched while on the ground, otherwise, the player may stand up and continue to advance the ball. Hitting a player who is kneeling, sliding, or clearly intends to run the ball out of bounds (especially quarterbacks) is generally viewed as unsportsmanlike and is often penalized, and in the most blatant of cases (especially if it happens in the dying seconds of a game), the player may be subject to off-field disciplinary action by their respective league governing body, usually in the form of fines or suspensions.

===Overtime===

The procedures to settle games that are tied at the end of regulation vary considerably among football leagues.

Most leagues other than the NFL, including the CFL, use a procedure frequently called the &quot;Kansas Playoff&quot;, so named because it was first developed for high school-football in that state. The rules are summarized here:
* A coin toss at the start of overtime determines the team that first receives possession in overtime, and which end zone will be used.
* Each team in turn receives one possession starting with first-and-10 at a fixed point on the field, which varies according to league:
** U.S. college (also Texas public high schools, which play by NCAA rules): Opponent&#x27;s 25-yard line for the first two overtime procedures.
*** Each procedure after the second consists of a single scrimmage play from the opponent&#x27;s 3-yard line, with kicks banned. Successful plays in this situation are scored as two-point conversions.
** U.S. high school (also British Columbia, where high schools play under American rules): Standard rules call for the opponent&#x27;s 10-yard line, but state/provincial associations are free to use different yardage (Missouri, for instance, starts at the 25). The short-lived Alliance of American Football also used the opponent&#x27;s 10-yard line.
** CFL: Opponent&#x27;s 35-yard line
* The game clock does not run, but the play clock is enforced.
* At all levels, possessions end when the offensive team scores, misses a field goal, or turns the ball over. Touchdowns are followed by a conversion attempt, with the following additional caveats:
** U.S. college: Teams must attempt a two-point conversion starting with double overtime. From triple overtime &amp; thereafter, all plays are two-point conversion attempts, and scored as such.
** CFL and AAF: A convert kick is not allowed in overtime—all conversion attempts must be scrimmage plays (i.e., two-point attempts).
** U.S. and BC high school: Standard rules call for no restrictions on the type of conversion attempt, but some state/provincial associations may limit the use of kick tries.
* Ability of defensive team to score after gaining possession on a turnover:
** U.S. college, CFL, AAF, Texas high school: Can advance the ball upon gaining possession; if it scores a touchdown, it will satisfy the condition of each team having a chance to score and thus end the game.
** U.S. and BC high school (except Texas): Possession ends immediately.
* Each team receives one charged timeout per overtime procedure except in the CFL and AAF, which allow(ed) no timeouts in overtime.
* If the score remains tied at the end of an overtime procedure, another procedure follows (except as noted below), with the team that had the second possession in the previous procedure having the first possession of the next procedure.
* Limit on number of overtime procedures:
** U.S. college and high school: No limit; procedures continue until a winner is decided (some states limit the number of procedures or outlaw it altogether for games below the high school varsity level).
** CFL: In regular season games, maximum of two procedures, with the game declared a tie if it remains level. In postseason games, procedures continue until a winner is decided.
** AAF: Same as CFL, except that only one procedure was allowed in regular-season games. The league folded without holding any playoff games.

One aspect of the AAF overtime rules was unique to that league—field goals were prohibited during overtime.

The NFL overtime is a modified sudden-death period of 15 minutes, for playoff games only; since the 2017 season, overtime periods in the preseason and regular season are 10 minutes, as part of an overall effort by the NFL to speed up games and reduce their length. If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, or the defensive team scores a safety, the game ends at that point. If the receiving team scores a field goal, the game continues with the scoring team kicking off, and the scored-upon team having a chance at possession. If that team scores a touchdown, or loses possession, the game ends; if it scores a field goal, overtime continues, with the next score by either team ending the game. In the regular season, if a game remains tied after the 10-minute period, it is declared a tie. In postseason games, there are multiple 15-minute periods until a winner is decided.

The overtime protocol of the second XFL, currently on hiatus, was significantly different from that of other leagues, being most similar to that used in US college football after that rule set&#x27;s fourth overtime procedure:
* Overtime consisted of a five-round &quot;shootout&quot; of two-point conversion attempts.
* No coin toss was used to determine the first possession—the visiting team started all rounds on offense.
* The defense could not score on a conversion attempt.
* The first defensive penalty against a team during a round resulted in the ball being moved to the 1-yard line. A second defensive penalty in that round resulted in a score being awarded to the offensive team.
* Pre-snap offensive penalties were enforced according to regular rules. Post-snap offensive penalties ended that side&#x27;s offensive round, with no score.
* All five rounds were played unless one team attained an insurmountable lead. If the game was still tied after five rounds, extra rounds were played until the tie was broken.

===Other differences===
Both games have a penalty for intentional grounding, which is making a forward pass without a significant chance of completion to prevent loss of yards. However, in Canadian football, this is penalized only if the pass failed to cross the line of scrimmage.

In American high school and college football, as well as at all levels of Canadian football, receivers need only have one foot in bounds (provided the player&#x27;s other foot does not come down out of bounds until the catch is made) for a catch to count as a reception. NFL play requires receivers to get both feet on the ground and in bounds after making the catch for a reception to count. Up through the 2007 season, an NFL official could award a catch if it was judged that the receiver would have come down in bounds if he had not been pushed by a defender. This rule was based on a judgment call by the official, and was criticized for being inconsistent. The rule was dropped prior to the 2008 season by the NFL.
* In Canadian football, defensive pass interference may be called on any legal forward pass, even when the receiver is behind the line of scrimmage. Pass interference rules in all levels of American football do not apply until the thrown ball crosses the neutral zone.
* In American football, when a forward pass is deemed to be &quot;uncatchable&quot; (impossible for the intended receiver to catch even if no interference had occurred), defensive interference with said receiver is not penalized. Canadian football lacked this rule until its adoption in 2010.

CFL roster sizes are 46 players (rather than 53 as in the NFL, though only 45 will dress for a game). A CFL team may dress up to 44 players, composed of 21 &quot;nationals&quot; (essentially, Canadians), 20 &quot;internationals&quot; (almost exclusively Americans), and 3 quarterbacks.

Player numbering schemes are similar in both Canadian and American football are similar, with Canadian rules being slightly less strict. In American football, players who wear numbers from 50 to 79 are, by rule, prohibited from catching or touching forward passes if their team is in possession of the ball and may not line up in a position that allows them to do so, unless explicitly indicated to the referee during a tackle-eligible play. In Canadian football, the ineligible numbers span only 50 to 69. Also, in the CFL the numbers 0 and 00, historically banned at all levels in American football, have long been available for use, other than for the aforementioned ineligible players. (Effective in 2023, a team cannot have players wearing 0 and 00 in the same game.) In the early 2020s, the rules were relaxed in American football to allow the number 0 in college and professional football, although 00 remains prohibited.

The traditional NFL football season runs from the second week of September until late December or the start of January, with the NFL playoffs occurring in January and February. In contrast, the CFL regular season runs from June to late October. This is in order to ensure the Grey Cup playoffs can be completed in mid-November, before the harsh Canadian winters set in. This is an important consideration for a sport played in outdoor venues in locations such as Regina, Edmonton and Winnipeg.

In American football, officials typically use yellow penalty flags, while coaches&#x27; challenge flags are red. Before the 2022 CFL season, officials&#x27; penalty flags used in the CFL were orange in color, and challenge flags were yellow. Since then the CFL has adopted the NFL&#x27;s flag colours. In American leagues, the referee wears a solid white cap, and the other officials wear black with white piping. Until 2018 in the CFL, the referee wore a black cap with white piping, and the other officials wore white caps with black piping; starting with the 2019 season, the referee now wears a white cap with black piping, and the other officials wear black ones with white piping, almost mirroring the American convention (and matching the standard for the lower levels of the game in Canada). Additionally, when announcing penalties, in American football, the penalized team is announced using generic terms (&quot;offense&quot;/&quot;defense&quot;, for example), but in Canadian football (especially the CFL) the penalized team is announced by their respective city or province.

The CFL regular season comprises 18 games since 1986, with the exception of 2021, in which a 14-game schedule was used, while the NFL regular season has consisted of 17 games since 2021. There are several radical differences concerning how the leagues calculate regular season records and how ties in the standings are broken:
* The CFL awards two points for a win, one point for a tie and zero points for a loss (from 2000 to 2002 inclusive, the CFL also awarded one point for an overtime loss). The CFL ranking system is in keeping with the traditional system in most other football codes of British origin, and is also the basis for the system used in hockey. The NFL by contrast officially ranks its teams strictly by winning percentage, with ties counting as a &quot;half-win&quot; for the purposes of calculating winning percentage. Prior to 1972, ties were ignored altogether for the purposes of calculating NFL winning percentages, which actually made them more valuable than a &quot;half-win&quot;: teams with a winning record including ties had an advantage in terms of earning a better winning percentage for the purposes of playoff qualification and teams with a losing record including ties had an advantage in terms of earning better draft position. In all competitions in both countries, it is popular for team records to be expressed in a simple &quot;W-L&quot; format, or in a &quot;W-L-T&quot; format, only if there are ties in the team&#x27;s record.
* The CFL nominally awards three playoff berths per division while the NFL awards a playoff berth to each of its division winners (four per conference) and three wild card berths per conference (previously only two wild card berths before the 2020 season). The CFL allows the possibility of a fourth place team in one division to &quot;cross over&quot; in place of the third place team of the other division, but only if it has a better record than the third place team. Also, even though the CFL has an unequal number of teams per division there is no possibility of the fifth place team in the West Division qualifying, even if it finishes outright fifth or sixth overall. By contrast, an NFL team finishing second in its division receives no special advantage should it finish tied with a third place team in another division for the final wild card berth. Beyond that, the tie-breaking criteria are radically different (although they both culminate in an as-yet-unused coin toss should all criteria be exhausted). For example, the CFL&#x27;s first tie-breaker is number of wins, whereas number of wins is not an NFL tie-breaking criterion in itself, meaning an NFL team with no ties would have neither an advantage nor a disadvantage over another team with one less win and two ties, assuming they played the same number of games.

==Strategic and tactical differences==

Although the rules of Canadian and American football have similarities, the differences have a great effect on how teams play and are managed.

===Red-zone management===

The red zone is an unofficial term designating the portion of the field between the 20-yard line and the goal line. Due to the goalposts&#x27; being on the goal line in Canadian football, teams must avoid hitting the goalposts. Thus most touchdown throws are aimed away from the centre portion of the end zone. In the CFL, the goalposts have the same construction as the NFL posts, with the centre post being about 2 yards deep in the end zone. It is extremely rare for CFL passes to hit any part of the posts. When this occurs, a dead ball results. Occasionally, receivers can use the post to good effect in a &#x27;rub&#x27; play to shed a defender. End zone passing becomes even more complicated when the corners of the end zone are truncated, as is the case at stadia where the field is bounded by a running track. However, the offensive team enjoys a counteracting advantage of end zones more than twice the size of those in American football (20 yards with a wider field), significantly expanding the area that must be covered by the defensive team and also allowing the freedom to run some pass patterns not available in American football&#x27;s red zone. Moreover, the rule requiring only a single foot to be in bounds upon pass reception in Canadian football further stretches the amount of area that the offenses have to work with. NFL offenses generally try a run between tackles when on the one-yard line. CFL offenses make similar attempts on first down on the one-yard line, but second and third down attempts, if required, can be much more varied than their NFL counterparts.

===Special teams===
The frequency of punts is highly dependent upon the success, or lack thereof, of the offense. Punt returns are ubiquitous in Canadian football because the &quot;no-yards&quot; rule permits virtually every punt to be fielded and returned. Moreover, if the kicking team punts the ball out of bounds in an attempt to forestall a return and the ball goes out of bounds between the two 15-yard lines without touching the ground first, a 10-yard penalty is assessed and the ball advanced from where it left play, or the kicking team is backed up 10 yards and must replay the down. &quot;Shanked&quot; punts are therefore extremely costly to the kicking team. Though missed field goals may be returned in both national rule sets, the deeper end zone and goal post positioning make this much more common in Canadian rules. TSN on-air analysts state that they are the single play-from-scrimmage most likely to result in a touchdown. This set of special teams play (field goal return units) are rare in the American game to the point where a returner is not a standard part of a defensive field goal unit and will only be seen in unusual circumstances, with one especially notable example being the famous &quot;Kick Six&quot; college football game in 2013. Canadian kickoffs rarely result in a touchback, so special teams are more prominent in that area of the game as well. The difference in the games&#x27; final minutes procedures make comebacks—and the need for an onside kick &#x27;hands&#x27; team—more prominent as well. The rule regarding last touch of the ball before leaving the play of field, rather than American football&#x27;s last possession rule, makes the onside kick more likely to be successful as well. The most complex coaching job in Canadian football is said to be that of special teams co-ordinator. As many as 40 of a CFL roster of players may have a special teams role because of the wide variety of possible situations. In 2014 and 2015, the Edmonton Eskimos even used their third-string quarterbacks (Pat White in 2014 and Jordan Lynch in 2015) as part of their kick and kick-coverage teams. This is highly unusual, as quarterbacks are generally discouraged from making contact plays. Kick returning was a duty generally handled by a player with another role, such as receiver or defensive back. Henry &quot;The Gizmo&quot; Williams was the first player designated by telecasts as &quot;KR&quot; for a kicker returner position as his duties were almost entirely for that role, and referring to him as &quot;WR&quot; for wide receiver was increasingly seen as anachronistic. By far the greatest kick returner in professional football history, Gizmo Williams had more returns for touchdowns called back for infractions than any other player has ever scored (28: 26 punts, 2 kick-offs). No NFL player has enjoyed similar success and the careers of such specialists (like Devin Hester) come nowhere near to matching the impact on the game that such players have in the CFL.

===Management of offensive drives===
Canadian teams have only three downs to advance the ball ten yards compared to four downs in the American game. With one fewer down, Canadian teams must try for the big gain. For this reason, Canadian teams usually prefer passing over rushing to a greater extent than American, since pass attempts generally tend to gain more yards than rushing. This makes the action in Canadian football more open than is the case in the American game. Offensive drives (continuous possession of the ball) tend to be shorter.

Having three downs on a much longer and wider field with unlimited backfield motion results in Canadian teams requiring faster, more nimble athletes (comparatively) than their American counterparts. Paradoxically, this makes Canadian defense better at defending rushing plays. Rushing plays tend to be unlikely to produce a full ten-yard gain, and if correctly anticipated by the defense, much gain at all. The fewer downs means that an unsuccessful rushing play leaves an offense to have a single play to make comparatively longer first down yardage, so rushing plays are less favored unless the team on offense is actively managing the clock while maintaining the lead.

Pundits often like to claim that a Canadian team that rushes for 100 yards or more per game is likely to win, but the reality is winning teams rush the ball in defense of their leads, and not as a tactic to produce drives that lead to points unless they are markedly superior to their opponents. The larger field generally permits greater YAC (yards after catch) on each individual catch, where the NFL produces passing plays that either result in immediate tackles for relatively few YAC, or huge gains resulting from missed tackles or broken coverage.

In theory, an NFL team taking possession on their own one-yard line, using three downs for each first-down conversion and the full 40 second clock could run 27 plays and consume 18 minutes of clock time covering the 99 yards. A CFL team doing something similar (two plays per conversion, 20 second clock, average 10 seconds of clock time while the officials reset the ball between plays, 109 yards) would run 24 plays and consume 12 minutes of clock at the most.

One other notable difference is the propensity of CFL quarterbacks to rush the ball, both by design and as a result of reacting to the defense. Damon Allen (the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen) had 11,920 rushing yards to go along with 72,381 passing yards in his 23-year career and actually sits third overall in career rushing yards. Contrast that with Randall Cunningham&#x27;s 4928 yards over 16 seasons. 1000-yard rushing seasons for CFL quarterbacks have occurred, and 400-yard seasons for playoff-bound teams&#x27; starting quarterbacks, if they remain healthy for the entire schedule, are not unusual.

===Backfield motion===
Perhaps the greatest difference arises due to the virtually unlimited movement allowed in the defensive and offensive backfields on a play from scrimmage in the Canadian game vs. very restricted offensive movement in the American game. Combined with the much larger field size, this difference changes the skillsets required of the athletes.

Canadian wide receivers, safeties and cornerbacks are far enough from the point where the ball is snapped that they rarely participate in rush offense or defense. Linebackers can be called upon to successfully defend running backs sent to receive passes. There is therefore a much greater premium placed on athletic speed, with former Edmonton Eskimos GM and former wide receiver Ed Hervey (, , All-American at USC in the 200 meter) and Malcolm Frank ( ) being prototypical for the CFL. The offence has many more formation options and starting positions, forcing the defence to anticipate more possibilities. Seven of the 12 men on a CFL offense (typically the five linemen and the wide receivers) must be at the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, and the other five must be at least one yard behind the line. Only the quarterback and linemen must be motionless at the time of the snap, allowing up to six players to be moving toward or along the line at varying speeds (typically the wide receivers are still or at a walking pace at the snap to ensure they are at the line of scrimmage.)

===Late comebacks===
In both the college and pro games, an offensive team with the lead has more difficulty in running out the clock in the Canadian game.

In the Canadian Football League, the clock is stopped while the officials place the ball, and then they whistle the game clock and play clock to begin in the last minutes of a half; whereas in the National Football League the clock remains running while the officials set the ball (dependent upon the result of the previous play—penalty, incomplete pass, out-of-bounds, or tackle inbounds in both leagues) while the play clock of 40 seconds runs down. The game clock only begins again when the play is whistled in, for an inbounds tackle, or at the snap of the ball for the other outcomes in the CFL. A team that is ahead has one fewer opportunity to kill clock time in the Canadian game with three downs, and can only take the play clock time (20 seconds) and the length of the play itself off the clock with each down. On the other hand, Canadian teams only receive two timeouts per game, of which only one can be used in the last three minutes of the fourth quarter, whereas teams get three timeouts per half in American football. After the three-minute warning, a penalty of a loss of down (on first and second down, 10 yards on third down) results for failing to start the new play in time (time count violation).

Additionally, if a Canadian team commits a time count violation on third down, the referee has the right to require that it legally start a new play before the play clock expires, and can award possession to the defending team if another time count is committed. Moreover, in any quarter, when the game clock expires while the ball is dead in Canadian football, a final play must be run with &quot;zeros on the clock&quot; before the quarter ends, whereas in American football the expiration of time while the ball is dead immediately ends the quarter (including overtime periods in such cases where those periods are timed). In American football, it is common (or even, arguably, expected) for teams including coaching staffs and other such personnel to come on the field in order to shake hands, etc. before the game clock officially expires, especially in cases where the trailing team does not have possession of the ball, has no timeouts left and the result of the final play of the game left the clock running with less than forty seconds left.

The main caveats are that in all gridiron codes, a half cannot end on any penalty accepted by the non-penalized team even if there is no time remaining on the clock, and a team may always elect to attempt a conversion after a touchdown even if time is expired, so it is always possible for a final play to run with &quot;zeros on the clock&quot; under such circumstances. If a team that is trailing in the CFL can begin to produce two-and-outs on defense and efficient scoring drives on offense, 14 and even 17 points can be successfully scored in the final three minutes. This comeback proclivity is so pronounced that the CFL uses it for marketing purposes: No Lead Is Safe.

<text>Jamsheed Marker (24 November 1922 – 21 June 2018) was a Pakistani diplomat and a cricket commentator. The recipient of Hilal-e-Imtiaz, he was associated with diplomatic career for over 42 years. He was notable for his tenure as Ambassador to the United States, serving from 17 September 1986 to 30 June 1989 during the administrations of Prime Ministers Muhammad Khan Junejo and Benazir Bhutto. He claimed to have helped negotiate the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

From 1995 through 2005, Marker taught a course in &quot;Diplomacy in International Relations&quot; at Eckerd College, a Private liberal arts college in St. Petersburg, Florida.

==Awards and recognition==
*Hilal-i-Imtiaz Award (Crescent of Excellence) by President Pervez Musharraf in 2003.
*Sitara-i-Quaid-e-Azam Award

==Early life==
Jamsheed Kekobad Ardeshir Marker was born in Hyderabad, India, on 24 November 1922, into a distinguished Parsee (Parsi), or Zoroastrian, family that had been in shipping business. His father was Kekobad Ardeshir Marker, who ran the family pharmaceutical business, and his mother was Meherbano Marker nee Pestonji, a homemaker.

He attended the elite Doon boarding school (The Doon School) in Dehradun, India, and Forman Christian College University in Lahore, Pakistan.

In early days at school level in Dehradun located in India, Marker played cricket there and later at F.C. College Lahore.

==Career==
During World War II, Marker was an officer in the Royal Indian Naval Volunteer Reserve, commanding a minesweeper. He was awarded the 1939/45 Star, Burma Star, War Service Medal for his military service.

He worked in his family business, shipping and pharmaceuticals, after the Second World War ended, and during the 1950s became famous for his radio commentary on cricket, one of Pakistan’s most popular sports.

===Cricket commentator===
Marker was a radio cricket match commentator. His first broadcast was from the Bagh-e-Jinnah, also known as Lawrence Garden, in Lahore when India visited Pakistan on their first cricket tour in 1954. He teamed up with cricket commentator Omar Kureishi for the first time as a Radio Pakistan cricket commentator.

===Diplomat===
Marker worked in his family&#x27;s shipping business until April 1965, when he was appointed Pakistan&#x27;s High Commissioner to Ghana during the height of popularity for its independence leader Kwame Nkrumah, with concurrent accreditation to Guinea and Mali. He afterward represented Pakistan in Romania, the Soviet Union (1969 – 1972), Canada, East Germany, Japan, the United Nations Office at Geneva, West Germany, France, the United States (1986 – 1989) and finally the United Nations in New York City (1990 – 1994). Marker served as Ambassador of Pakistan continually for thirty years, in ten different capitals, and nine further concurrent accreditations.

Jamsheed Marker was able to communicate in English, French, German, Russian, Urdu and his native language Gujarati. He was appointed Ambassador to the United States in 1986 and helped negotiate the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Marker, in his 2010 memoir &quot;Quiet Diplomacy,&quot; described contacts with official and unofficial representatives from both the United States and the Soviet Union, where he had also been ambassador. Pakistan was playing a key role in the negotiations. He also worked closely with the Pakistani military dictator General Zia Ul-Haq as the general developed the country’s clandestine nuclear weapons program.

In 1999, he served as United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan&#x27;s Special Representative to East Timor. Annan is reported to have hailed Marker&#x27;s &quot;empathy for both sides in the talks&quot;. The Portuguese foreign minister praised Marker&#x27;s &quot;sophisticated and calm approach&quot; while the Indonesian foreign minister said Marker&#x27;s &quot;diplomatic skills smoothed the way whenever there was a &#x27;snag in the negotiations&#x27;&quot;. Marker chronicled his experiences in his 2003 book &quot;East Timor: A Memoir of the Negotiations for Independence.&quot;

The British journalist Richard Lloyd Parry, in his book &quot;In the Time of Madness&quot;, recalls Marker&#x27;s words of praise for the Indonesian police and the &quot;superb leadership&quot; of their commander Timbul Silaien after the referendum on independence for East Timor and its bloody preamble. Within days, these same Indonesian security forces were engaged in the deportation and, in some cases, the killing of East Timorese.

Marker also served as ambassador in France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, West Germany and East Germany — where he opened the Pakistani Embassy. Despite being a non-Muslim in conservative Muslim Pakistan, he was broadly respected at home and had close relationships with several leaders of the country.

Some critics say Marker was more at ease with the military rulers of the country than its civilian leaders. In his book &quot;Cover Point&quot; (2016), Marker remembered General Ayub Khan, Pakistan’s first military ruler, as a leader who &quot;did give us security, law and order, good governance and economic prosperity.&quot;

Marker had little praise for civilian prime ministers like Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, whom he regarded as financially corrupt, and he was critical of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s iron-fisted management style while praising many of his qualities, the former prime minister and father of Ms. Bhutto, blaming him for most of his country’s ailments.

===Teaching===
From 1995 through 2005, Marker taught a course in &quot;Diplomacy in International Relations&quot; at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.

In September 2004, Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz named Marker as ambassador-at-large for his years of service.

In June 2011, Marker was awarded an honorary doctorate by Forman Christian College University, Lahore, at the 2011–12 Commencement. Marker received the Hilal-i-Imtiaz Award (Crescent of Excellence) from President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf in 2003.

==Death and legacy==
Marker was married to Arnaz Minwalla. He was previously married to Diana Faridoon Dinshaw who died in 1979 of cancer. He had two daughters with Dinshaw: Niloufer Reifler and Feroza, who died in a car crash in the US in 2001.

Jamsheed Marker died on 21 June 2018 in Karachi at the age of 95. Besides his daughter, Niloufer, from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Arnaz (Minwalla) Marker; and his brother, Minocher Marker (Minoo Marker).

Jamsheed Marker served as a Pakistani diplomat continually for 30 years. He...&quot;helped negotiate the withdrawal of the former Soviet military from Afghanistan&quot; in 1988-1989. As of June 2018, this service earned him the title of &#x27;ambassador to more countries than any other person&#x27;

<doc id="1136595" wikidata="Q326287" url="?curid=1136595" title="Smooth Criminal">
<text>&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is a song by the American singer Michael Jackson, released on November 14, 1988 as the seventh single from his seventh studio album, &quot;Bad&quot; (1987). It was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. The lyrics describe a woman who has been attacked in her apartment by a &quot;smooth criminal&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, which premiered internationally on MTV on October 13, 1988, is the centerpiece of the 1988 film &quot;Moonwalker&quot;. The 1930s setting and Jackson&#x27;s white suit and fedora pay tribute to the Fred Astaire musical comedy film &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;. In the video, Jackson and the dancers perform an apparently physically impossible &quot;anti-gravity lean&quot;.

&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the sixth top-10 single from &quot;Bad&quot;. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It reached number one in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Spain.

Retrospective reviews have praised &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; as a standout track on &quot;Bad&quot; and one of Jackson&#x27;s best songs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that it was &quot;his best blend of R&amp;B groove and rock edginess, and a turning point in his shift toward darker, harder-edged material&quot;. It has appeared on numerous greatest hits albums and was performed on all of Jackson&#x27;s solo tours. &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; was re-released in 2006 as a single as a part of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; boxset. In 2001, a version by Alien Ant Farm became an international hit.

==Composition==
&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; evolved from an earlier song written by Jackson, &quot;Al Capone&quot; (named after real life gangster Al Capone), released on the 2012 reissue &quot;Bad 25&quot;. It is in the key of A minor, and Jackson&#x27;s vocal spans from G3 to C6. The lyrics describe a narrator who finds a bloodstained carpet and an unconscious body. The chorus refrain, &quot;Annie, are you OK?&quot;, was inspired by Resusci Anne, a dummy used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Trainees learn to say &quot;Annie, are you OK?&quot; while practicing resuscitation on the dummy. The original mix of the song includes the sound of Jackson&#x27;s fast-thumping heart and heavy breathing, which travel from left to right thanks to Hugo Zuccarelli&#x27;s Holophonics system.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the sixth top 10 single from &quot;Bad&quot;. It is certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and 2x platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The song reached number one in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and the top 10 in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland and the UK.

==Music video==
 Jackson asked Vincent Paterson to conceive a concept for the short film. Paterson listened to the unfinished song and came up with the concept of a 1930s gangster club. Paterson, who was a lead dancer in the music videos for &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, co-choreographed the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; video with Jackson and Jeffrey Daniel of the soul music group Shalamar. The video and Jackson&#x27;s white suit and fedora pay tribute to the Fred Astaire musical comedy film &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, particularly the &quot;Girl Hunt Ballet&quot; (itself inspired by the novels of Mickey Spillane) scene. The video, directed by Colin Chilvers, was shot between mid-February and April 1987 at Culver City, California, and in the backlot at Universal Studios Hollywood and premiered internationally on MTV on the night of October 13, 1988.

In the video, Jackson and the other dancers perform a lean that appears physically impossible. The dancers lean forward 45 degrees with their backs straight and feet flat on the floor, and hold the pose before returning upright. The lean moves the body&#x27;s center of mass further than it can support. The illusion was achieved using cables and a harness. In October 1993, Jackson&#x27;s team patented a method of performing the lean in concert using specially designed shoes that hook into pegs that rise from the stage. Even with the shoes, the move requires good athletic core strength.

The video won Best Music Video at the 1989 Brit Awards and the Critic&#x27;s Choice awarded Jackson the &quot;Best Video&quot; award and the People&#x27;s Choice Awards for &quot;Favorite Music Video&quot; for that same year.

In 2019, American television personality Kim Kardashian bought Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; fedora, which still had his makeup on it, for her daughter North West.

The style of clothing as well as mannerisms Jackson portrayed were reused in the numerous adaptations of the video game &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker&quot;. The song serves as the background music for the &quot;Club 30s&quot; stage, the nightclub seen in the music video, that appears in the game. The video is the centerpiece of the 1988 film &quot;Moonwalker&quot;. 

On October 23, 2024, the video achieved 1 billion views on YouTube, making it the fifth of Jackson&#x27;s video to reach this milestone after &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Jason Elias of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; was &quot;a gorgeous and exhilarating record ... [it] presents Michael Jackson at his most captivating and it never fails to impress&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the sixth best Jackson song, writing that it was &quot;his best blend of R&amp;B groove and rock edginess, and a turning point in his shift toward darker, harder-edged material.&quot; In a retrospective review of &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote: &quot;[Smooth Criminal] is a sleek, exhilarating action sequence of a song that&#x27;s unlike anything else in Jackson&#x27;s catalog ... an urgent and inspired highlight. &quot;Bad&quot; is at its best when it explores the darker, more paranoid side that began to consume Jackson&#x27;s life in the late &#x27;80s, and this song captures that impulse.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;If there was one song on &quot;Bad&quot; that truly captured the sense of artistic freedom that Jackson felt after &quot;Thriller&quot;, it was this track ... This is pop music as suspense drama.&quot;

==Alien Ant Farm version==
In May 2001, the American rock band Alien Ant Farm released a &quot;funky metallic&quot; cover of &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; as the second single from their second studio album, &quot;Anthology&quot; (2001). According to the singer, Dryden Mitchell, the band would play a few riffs of the song while warming up before gigs and audience members would request the entire song. 

The cover became a number-one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and was also a number-one hit in Australia for eight weeks. In Europe, it reached number three in the United Kingdom and charted within the top 10 in 10 other countries. Alien Ant Farm&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; includes a hidden track named &quot;Slick Thief&quot;, which is an early version of &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;.

Mitchell said he came to resent how popular the cover was, and did not want to perform it, thinking: &quot;We&#x27;re a better band than just this song.&quot; However, he accepted that fans wanted to hear it and decided he was being immature. He described it as a &quot;fun party song&quot; like the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Fight for Your Right&quot;.

===Music video and reaction from Jackson===
The music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld and shot in San Fernando, California. It features the band performing in a wrestling ring, and in front of a suburban house. The video also references various Jackson music videos and elements of his personal life, including the original &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; video, Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalk, and his pet chimp Bubbles.

Before its release, Alien Ant Farm sent the video to Jackson for his approval. At his request, they reshot some scenes to remove a child wearing a surgical mask, a reference to how Jackson wore them in public to cover cosmetic surgeries. However, Jackson decided he preferred the video with the mask. Reflecting on the video in 2022, Mitchell said, &quot;We went through quite a bit of money and bullshit to make sure that we were appeasing Michael Jackson.&quot;

<text>Chaim Moshe Tzadik Palestine (born August 15, 1947), known professionally as Charlemagne Palestine, is an American visual artist and musician. He has been described as being one of the founders of New York school of minimalist music, first initiated by La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Phil Niblock, although he prefers to call himself a maximalist.

==Formational years==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Palestine began by singing sacred Jewish music and studying accordion and piano. At the age of 12 he started playing backup conga and bongo drum for Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Kenneth Anger, and Tiny Tim. From 1962 to 1969, Palestine was carillonneur for the Saint Thomas Episcopal Church in Manhattan, eventually creating a piece that consisted of 1,500 15-minute performances.

From 1968 to 1972, Palestine studied vocal interpretation with Pandit Pran Nath, experimented on kinetic light sculptures with Len Lye, composed music for Tony and Beverly Conrad’s film &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;, taught at CalArts with Morton Subotnick, created the sound and movement piece &quot;Illuminations&quot; with Simone Forti, and developed his own alternative synthesizer: the &quot;Spectral Continuum Drone Machine&quot;.

Throughout the seventies Palestine created records, videos, sculptural objects, abstract expressionist visual scores, and performed long piano concerts regularly in his loft on North Moore Street in Tribeca in the company of his bevy of stuffed animals. From 1980 to 1995, Palestine performed only rarely, exhibiting instead at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Moderna Museet, Stockholm; and in documenta 8. During that time, he also founded the Ethnology Cinema Project in New York, which is dedicated to preserving films that document disappearing traditional cultures.

After moving to Europe in 1995, he settled in Brussels. In addition to creating exhibitions, Palestine performed regularly, re-releasing older material and developing new videos and sonic projects.

She led a community of formerly-enslaved escapees, the majority of them West African in descent, called the Windward Maroons, along with their children and families. At the beginning of the 18th century, under the leadership of Nanny, the Windward Maroons fought a guerrilla war lasting many years against British authorities in the Colony of Jamaica, in what became known as the First Maroon War.

Much of what is known about Nanny comes from oral history, as little textual evidence exists. According to Maroon legend, Queen Nanny was born in 1686 and was an Asante from Asanteman, who was taken into slavery by the British.

During the years of warfare, the British suffered significant losses in their encounters with the Windward Maroons of eastern Jamaica. Maroons attributed their success against the British to the successful use of supernatural powers by Nanny, while historians believe that the Maroons&#x27; mastery of guerrilla warfare and vast knowledge of the natural terrain played a significant role in their successes. Having failed to defeat them on the battlefield, the British sued the Maroons for peace, signing a treaty with them on 20 April 1740. The treaty stopped the hostilities, provided state-sanctioned freedom for the Maroons, and granted 500 acres (202 ha) of land to Nanny and her followers. The village built through that land grant still stands, and is called Moore Town or the &quot;New&quot; Nanny Town. Modern members of Moore Town celebrate 20 April 1740 as a holiday, known informally in places today as &quot;4/20&quot; or &quot;four-twenty&quot;.

In 1975, the government of Jamaica declared Nanny their only female national hero by celebrating her success as a leader. Her image is printed on the Jamaican $500 note, which is referred to as a &quot;Nanny&quot;.

== The origins of Nanny ==
According to a Maroon legend espoused by the Maroons of Accompong Town, Nanny was born into the Asante people of modern day Ghana. According to several Maroon colonels, her mother&#x27;s name is Nyankopong. It is possible that this figure was the founder of the Oyoko clan Antwiwaa Nyame. As Nyankopong is another name for Nyame and the name Nyame is paired with Antwiwaa. In other words, she is a relative of the Asante ruling class of the Oyoko clan. She and her brother&#x27;s name was also Acheampong and both Acheampong and Antwiwaa are Asante rooted names no other Akan has.

The notion that there are several versions of her early story stems from the fact that Maroons, like most Africans, deify their ancestors and use them as characters in folk tales. She is often the subject of many Maroon stories, and therefore there are numerous origin stories. 
In one Maroon story, Nanny came to Jamaica as a slave but then escaped, perhaps even jumping off of the ship while it was offshore, while her sister Sekesu was enslaved. The legend states that Queen Nanny became mother of all Maroons and her sister Sekesu became mother of all enslaved in Jamaica. The oral traditions about her arrival in Jamaica maintain that she was always free, while Sekesu eventually died free in the mountains with Nanny.

In another story, she came as a free woman who may have even had her own slaves. Another version of her life tells that she was of royal African blood and came to Jamaica as a free woman. She may have been married to a Maroon man possibly named Adou, and had one Son name Kwashkwaku, nicknamed Granfara Puss.
Relatives of poet John Agard claim descent from Nanny.

According to one Maroon legend, Nanny&#x27;s name was also Sarah &quot;Matilda&quot; Rowe, but that has not been verified. The Rowe family of Jamaica claim direct descent from Nanny. According to oral history, her second husband was named Swipplemento, later known by the Anglicised name of Rose Harris, affectionally called Pa Rose then Pa Ro, Queen Nanny was known as Shanti Rose or Ma Ro. Oral tradition states that Ro eventually became anglicized as Rowe, though many Maroons of the late 18th century changed their African names for European ones, as they converted to Christianity. Maroon legend states that Nanny was known to have gone by the name Sarah, and sometimes Matilda. Oral history states that she had three children with Swipplemento; two sons Kojo Rowe and Ampong Rowe, and a daughter called Nanny as well.

== The Jamaican Maroons ==

The maroons are descendants of West Africans, mainly people from the Akan. They were known as Coromantie or Koromantee, and were considered ferocious fighters. A number of the enslaved originated from other regions of Africa, including Nigeria, the Congo and Madagascar. However, at least half of the enslaved African people in Jamaica during the early English colonisation of the island were also Asante in origin, as shown in maternal genetics, linguistics and cultural evidence. 

After being brought to Jamaica in the course of the Transatlantic slave trade, many enslaved Africans fled from the oppressive conditions of plantations and formed their own communities of free black people in Jamaica in the rugged, hilly interior of the island. People who escaped from slavery joined these Maroon communities in the mountains of eastern Jamaica, or the Cockpit Country in the west of the island. Up to the 1650s under Spanish rule, enslaved Africans escaped and intermarried with the native islanders, the Taíno or Arawak, in their communities in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica), located in Portland Parish and Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica, in the eastern end of the island.

Many Maroons were escaped slaves, who ran away from their Spanish-owned plantations when the British took the Caribbean island of Jamaica from Spain in 1655. However, many modern-day Maroons believe that The Maroons of Nanny Town belonged to a separate group that existed in the Mountains prior to 1655. They state that Queen Nanny&#x27;s Maroons date back to the Tainos fleeing to the Blue Mountains when the Spaniards first arrived in Jamaica. Maroon oral history maintains that her family arrived in 1640 and joined the existing Maroons, whose community allegedly existed about 150 years before the Spanish fled Jamaica.

== Windward Maroons ==

In 1655, following the Invasion of Jamaica, the English captured Jamaica from the Spaniards, but many Spanish slaves became free under Spanish Maroon leaders such as Juan de Bolas and Juan de Serras. The Spanish left, freeing their slaves in the process, and they joined the Windward Maroon communities. These formerly enslaved people, with their ranks enhanced with escaped and liberated slaves, became the core of the Windward Maroons. They staged a prolonged fight against English subjugation and enslavement. Later in the 17th century, more slaves escaped joining the two main bands of Windward and Leeward Maroons. By the early 18th century, these Maroon towns were headed respectively by Nanny, who shared the leadership of the eastern Maroons with Quao, and Captain Cudjoe and Accompong in the west. The Windward Maroons fought the British on the east side of the island from their villages in the Blue Mountains of Portland.

The community raised animals, hunted, and grew crops. Maroons at Nanny Town and similar communities survived by sending traders to the nearby market towns to exchange food for weapons and cloth. It was organized very much like a typical Asante society in Africa. From 1655 until they signed peace treaties in 1739 and 1740, these Maroons led most of the slave rebellions in Jamaica, helping to free slaves from the plantations. They raided and then damaged lands and buildings held by plantation owners.

The Maroons were also known for raiding plantations for weapons and food, burning the plantations, and leading freed slaves to join their mountain communities. Nanny was highly successful at organizing plans to free slaves. During a period of 30 years, she was credited with freeing more than 1000 slaves, and helping them to resettle in the Maroon community.

== The First Maroon War ==

By 1720, Nanny and Quao, sometimes called her brother, settled and controlled an area in the Blue Mountains. It was later given the name Nanny Town, and it had a strategic location overlooking Stony River via a 900-foot (270 m) ridge, making a surprise attack by the British very difficult.

Nanny became a folk hero among the Maroons and the slaves. While the British captured Nanny Town on more than one occasion, they were unable to hold on to it, in the wake of numerous guerrilla attacks from the Maroons. The Maroons waged a successful war against the British colonial forces over the course of a decade.

When Nanny Town was abandoned, the Windward Maroons under the command of Nanny moved to New Nanny Town. Between 1728 and 1734, during the First Maroon War, Nanny Town and other Maroon settlements were frequently attacked by British colonial forces. They wanted to stop the raids and believed that the Maroons prevented settlement of the interior. According to some accounts, in 1733 many Maroons of Nanny Town travelled across the island to unite with the Leeward Maroons. In 1734, a Captain Stoddart attacked the remnants of Nanny Town, &quot;situated on one of the highest mountains in the island&quot;, via &quot;the only path&quot; available: &quot;He found it steep, rocky, and difficult, and not wide enough to admit the passage of two persons abreast.&quot;

In addition to the use of the ravine, resembling what Jamaicans call a &quot;cockpit&quot;, the Maroons also used decoys to trick the British into ambushes. A few Maroons would run out into view of the British and then run in the direction of fellow Maroons who were hidden and would attack. After falling into these ambushes several times, the British retaliated. According to planter Bryan Edwards, who wrote his narrative half a century later, Captain Stoddart &quot;found the huts in which the negroes were asleep&quot;, and &quot;fired upon them so briskly, that many were slain in their habitations&quot;. However, recent evidence shows that the number of Windward Maroons killed by Stoddart in his attack on Nanny Town was in single digits.

== Military tactics ==
The Windward Maroons succeeded against a much superior and better armed enemy. One of their advantages over the British was their long-range communications capability. They pioneered the use of a cow horn called an abeng. This horn with a hole drilled in one end was used for long range communications. Its signals allowed Maroon lookouts to communicate over great distances, and they were not understood by the British who had no similar communications capability.

Nanny&#x27;s troops were masters of camouflage. The soldiers were so proficient at disguising their location that the British would circulate tales of trees in the forest becoming alive and cutting one&#x27;s head off. Besides the physical aspects of camouflage the Maroons became experts in slowing their breathing so as not to reveal their presence to someone in their vicinity. The maroons also developed ways of creating stealthy fires that were not readily visible.

The Windward Maroons were innovators in guerrilla warfare. They used surprise, the knowledge of the terrain, and cleverly chosen positions in their fight against the British. Their village was located in rugged territory with only one way in. That one way in was a narrow path that was only wide enough for one person. Soldiers trying to attack arrayed in a single file were easily ambushed. To heighten the enemy&#x27;s fear, Nanny&#x27;s forces never killed all of the attacking forces. She would always allow a remnant to live to return to base to relay the story and horror of the encounter.

== Treaty ==
When the British signed a treaty with Cudjoe in 1739, this success allowed them to offer a less favorable treaty to the Windward Maroons. Representatives of the British governor in Jamaica signed a treaty with the Windward Maroons in 1740, between the colonial authorities and Quao, who later became one of the leaders of Crawford&#x27;s Town. This treaty between the colonial authorities and Quao&#x27;s Maroons made no mention of how much land would be allocated to Crawford&#x27;s Town. As a result, a number of disputes occurred between planters and the Maroons of Crawford&#x27;s Town, and later the succeeding towns of Charles Town and Scott&#x27;s Hall. In response, the Assembly of Jamaica often tried to resolve the land disputes in favour of the Maroons to keep the peace.

In addition, later that year, there was a separate land grant signed with Nanny and the Maroons of Nanny Town, which granted &quot;Nanny and the people now residing with her and their heirs ... a certain parcel of Land containing five hundred acres in the parish of Portland ...&quot;. This land patent consisted of 500 acres (2.4 km2) of land granted by the government to the Maroons of New Nanny Town under a separate 1740 document ending the First Maroon War. The rebuilt Nanny Town, later called Moore Town was built on that location. In 1781, the Assembly agreed to purchase another additional 500 acres from neighbouring planter Charles Douglas to increase Moore Town&#x27;s communal land to 1,000 acres.

The New Nanny Town Maroons, like those of Cudjoe and Quao, agreed not to harbour new runaway slaves, but to help catch them for bounties. The Maroons were also expected to fight for the British in the case of an attack from the French or Spanish. In signing treaties with the Maroons, the British not only made a truce with a troublesome foe but also enlisted that foe in capturing runaway slaves. The colonial authorities initially recognised two Maroon towns: Crawford&#x27;s Town and Cudjoe&#x27;s Town, later to be renamed Trelawny Town. Eventually, there were five Maroon towns in the 18th century – Accompong Town, Trelawny Town, Charles Town, Scott&#x27;s Hall, and Nanny Town (later Moore Town) – living under their own chiefs with a British supervisor in each town. In exchange, they agreed not to harbour new runaway slaves, but to help catch them for bounties.

== Moore Town and Tacky&#x27;s War ==

New Nanny Town was renamed Moore Town, possibly in 1760 after the governor Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet, during Tacky&#x27;s War, which the Maroons helped to suppress. The first official reference to Moore Town in the colonial records was in 1760.

By 1760, New Nanny Town, now known as Moore Town, was under the command of a white superintendent named Charles Swigle, and the Maroon leaders of that town, Clash and Sambo, reported to Swigle, when the superintendent commanded their forces against slave rebels in Tacky&#x27;s War. It is possible that Nanny had already died by this time.

== A Spiritual Woman ==

Many in her community attributed Nanny&#x27;s leadership skills to her Obeah powers. Obeah is an African-derived religion that is still practised in Suriname, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, Belize and other Caribbean countries. It is associated with both good and bad magic, charms, luck, and with mysticism in general. In some Caribbean nations, aspects of Obeah have survived through synthesis with Christian symbolism and practice introduced by European colonials and slave owners.

According to Maroon oral history, Nanny&#x27;s success in defending her people against the colonial forces was often attributed to her mysterious supernatural powers. According to legend, Nanny had magical powers, and could catch bullets and then redirect them back at the people who shot at her.

Another Maroon legend claims that if any straight haired, white man, goes to the original Nanny Town, he is immediately struck dead.

== Death ==

In the &quot;Journal of the Assembly of Jamaica&quot;, 29–30 March 1733, is a citation for &quot;resolution, bravery and fidelity&quot; awarded to &quot;loyal slaves ... under the command of Captain Sambo&quot;, namely William Cuffee, who was rewarded for having fought the Maroons in the First Maroon War and who is called &quot;a very good party Negro, having killed Nanny, the rebels old obeah woman&quot;. These hired soldiers were known as &quot;Black Shots&quot;.

However, it is unlikely that Cuffee killed the Nanny who ran Nanny Town, since there is evidence Moore Town was granted to her people under her leadership in 1740.

Some claim that Queen Nanny lived to be an old woman, dying of natural causes in the 1760s. The exact date of her death remains a mystery. Part of the confusion is that &quot;Nanny&quot; is an honorific title, and many high-ranking women were called that in Maroon Town. However, the Maroons are adamant that there was only one &quot;Queen Nanny.&quot;

According to Maroon oral history, Nanny&#x27;s remains are buried at &quot;Bump Grave&quot; in Moore Town.

<text>Kevin Nealon (; born November 18, 1953) is an American comedian and actor. He has earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.

He first gained widespread attention during his tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1986 to 1995, where he anchored the show&#x27;s news parody segment &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, he acted in several of the Happy Madison films, played Doug Wilson on the Showtime series &quot;Weeds&quot;, and provided the voice of the title character, Glenn Martin, on &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Nealon was born on November 18, 1953 in St. Louis, Missouri, to Kathleen M. (née Kimball) and Emmett F. Nealon, an aircraft company executive. He has 4 siblings. A few months after he was born, the family moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut; when he was six, they moved to Heidelberg, West Germany for four years. He is of Irish descent and was raised Catholic. He graduated from St. Joseph High School in Trumbull, Connecticut, in 1971 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in marketing from Sacred Heart University. He then took night courses at Fairfield University, where he played quarterback on the club football team.

==Career==
Nealon played guitar in bands during high school and gravitated to comedy in college. In 1977, he moved to San Diego and then to Los Angeles, where he learned his craft at the Improv while tending bar there for a living. He had been doing stand-up for six years when he made his network television debut on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1984. He later became a regular there and on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. He appeared on stage, alongside Jan Hooks, both relatively unknown at the time, celebrating Tim Holleran&#x27;s big $90,000 cash win on &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; in 1985 (Holleran would win over $166,000 in cash and prizes). Holleran was a fellow comedian and a good friend of both Nealon and Hooks.

In 1986, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; recruited his friend Dana Carvey, and Carvey, in turn, recommended Nealon. Both joined the cast that year, and Nealon became a full-time performer in the 1987–1988 season, and remained for nine seasons. Nealon&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; characters include Mr. Subliminal (which also became known as the &quot;Subliminal Editorial&quot; when Nealon was promoted to &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchorman), Frank Gannon, P.I.P.I. (for Politically Incorrect Private Investigator), Bob Waltman (a male Barbara Walters), and Franz (of Hans and Franz) along with Carvey. He also parodied sportscaster Brent Musburger. From 1991 to 1994, Nealon anchored &quot;Weekend Update&quot; then stayed on &quot;SNL&quot; for one more season. By the time he departed in 1995, he had held the record for longest-tenured cast member at nine seasons, which has since been surpassed by Tim Meadows, Darrell Hammond, and Kenan Thompson.

In 1991, he had his first major film role, as boyfriend Tony Boer in &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot;. Other films in which he has since appeared include &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, &quot;Anger Management&quot;, &quot;Little Nicky&quot;, &quot;Just Go with It&quot;, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, &quot;Good Boy!&quot;, and &quot;Aliens in the Attic&quot; (2009). He has a part in many of Adam Sandler&#x27;s Happy Madison films, including &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2006), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; (2008), and &quot;Father of the Year&quot; (2018), and made a cameo appearance in the 2008 film &quot;Get Smart&quot;.
In the mid-1990s, Nealon played himself in three episodes of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. The most popular episode was titled &quot;The New Writer&quot; when he starts hanging around the office so much that Hank (played by actor Jeffrey Tambor) is worried Nealon is trying to steal his job. Garry Shandling and Nealon had a close relationship. In 1994, Nealon hosted the 13-part series &quot;Amazing America&quot; on the Discovery Channel.

Nealon had a recurring television role on the 2002–06 CBS comedy &quot;Still Standing&quot; playing Ted Halverson, the Millers&#x27; competitive and religious neighbor. He also appeared as a patient in a mental institution on the first season of &quot;Monk&quot;. Nealon played Dr. Mark Crest in &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; television show. It first aired on July 9, 1999, during the fifth season. From 2005 to 2012, Nealon had an ongoing supporting role as Doug Wilson on the show &quot;Weeds&quot; on Showtime. In 2009–2011 he voiced the title character in Nick at Nite&#x27;s animated series &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot;.

In 2002, he hosted &quot;The Conspiracy Zone&quot; on The New TNN for 26 episodes plus an unaired pilot. In 2004, he hosted the first season of &quot;Poker Royale&quot; on the Game Show Network. Nealon also hosted several years of &quot;World&#x27;s Funniest Commercials&quot; specials on TBS in the 2000s.

In 2008, he published a book chronicling his experiences during his wife&#x27;s pregnancy, &quot;Yes, You&#x27;re Pregnant, But What About Me?&quot;

Starting in 2015, Nealon portrayed Captain Telstar in commercials for Charter Spectrum. From 2016 to 2020, he was a regular on the TV sitcom &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;.

Since 2017 he has also hosted a YouTube talk show called &quot;Hiking with Kevin&quot; where he hikes a trail with various celebrity guests; the idea came about when during a hike with Matthew Modine the two of them ran out of breath, and Nealon thought it&#x27;d be funny to record their inability to talk. As of 2022, the show is on its fourth season with over 100 episodes. Nealon produces and edits the entire show by himself, recording simply using a selfie stick and a camera drone. In January 2025, Fox News Media announced that they had reached a deal with Nealon to stream episodes on Fox Nation.

==Personal life==

Nealon was dating Jan Hooks when they were both hired by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1989 he married Linda Dupree, a model and stuntwoman; they divorced in 2002. During this time, Nealon, who has been a vegetarian since 1989, became active in the animal rights movement; he has supported PETA, the Amanda Foundation, Farm Sanctuary, the Washington Wildlife Alliance, The Ark Trust&#x27;s Genesis Awards, and also Meat Out.

On September 3, 2005, he married Susan Yeagley in Bellagio, Lombardy, Italy. They have a son, Gable, born in 2007. They reside in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.

He is distantly related to Daniel Webster.

Nealon played rugby for Fairfield Yankees RFC.

On February 22, 2006, Nealon contributed an opinion article to &quot;The New York Times&quot; about having his phone tapped and his police records searched by Hollywood private investigator Anthony Pellicano, who was later convicted of crimes including racketeering and illegal wiretapping. It was also revealed in a separate court case later the same month that investigators working for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus may also have targeted Nealon for wiretapping in connection with his work for PETA. Nealon holds dual Irish and American citizenship.

Nealon is a fixture on the European melodic rock scene both as a fan, and as a benefactor; in 2019 he used his fame to organize a benefit for close friend and ailing rocker Tony Mills. All proceeds from the festival went towards Mills&#x27; medical expenses.

On May 15, 2022, Nealon was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa, by his alma mater, Sacred Heart University. Nealon also served as the convocation speaker for the graduating class of 2022.

<text>An Internet Draft (I-D) is a document published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) containing preliminary technical specifications, results of networking-related research, or other technical information. Often, Internet Drafts are intended to be work-in-progress documents for work that is eventually to be published as a Request for Comments (RFC) and potentially leading to an Internet Standard. 

It is considered inappropriate to rely on Internet Drafts for reference purposes. I-D citations should indicate the I-D is a &quot;work in progress&quot;.

An Internet Draft is expected to adhere to the basic requirements imposed on any RFC. 

An Internet Draft is only valid for six months unless it is replaced by an updated version. An otherwise expired draft remains valid while it is under official review by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) when a request to publish it as an RFC has been submitted. Expired drafts are replaced with a &quot;tombstone&quot; version and remain available for reference.

==Naming conventions==
Internet Drafts produced by the IETF working groups follow the naming convention: codice_1.

Internet Drafts produced by IRTF research groups following the naming convention: codice_2.

Drafts produced by individuals following the naming convention: codice_3

The IAB, RFC Editor, and other organizations associated with the IETF may also produce Internet Drafts. They follow the naming convention: codice_4.

The initial codice_5 is represented as codice_6. The second version, i.e. the first revision is represented as codice_7, and incremented for all following revisions.

<doc id="1136614" wikidata="Q1171964" url="?curid=1136614" title="Laguerre's method">
<text>In numerical analysis, Laguerre&#x27;s method is a root-finding algorithm tailored to polynomials. In other words, Laguerre&#x27;s method can be used to numerically solve the equation for a given polynomial . One of the most useful properties of this method is that it is, from extensive empirical study, very close to being a &quot;sure-fire&quot; method, meaning that it is almost guaranteed to always converge to &quot;some&quot; root of the polynomial, no matter what initial guess is chosen. However, for computer computation, more efficient methods are known, with which it is guaranteed to find all roots (see ) or all real roots (see Real-root isolation).

This method is named in honour of the French mathematician, Edmond Laguerre.

==Definition==
The algorithm of the Laguerre method to find one root of a polynomial of degree is:
* Choose an initial guess 
* For 
** If formula_1 is very small, exit the loop
** Calculate formula_2
** Calculate formula_3
** Calculate formula_4, where the sign is chosen to give the denominator with the larger absolute value, to avoid catastrophic cancellation.
** Set formula_5
* Repeat until &quot;a&quot; is small enough or if the maximum number of iterations has been reached.

If a root has been found, the corresponding linear factor can be removed from &quot;p&quot;. This deflation step reduces the degree of the polynomial by one, so that eventually, approximations for all roots of &quot;p&quot; can be found. Note however that deflation can lead to approximate factors that differ significantly from the corresponding exact factors. This error is least if the roots are found in the order of increasing magnitude.

==Derivation==
The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every th degree polynomial formula_6 can be written in the form

:formula_7

so that formula_8 are the roots of the polynomial. If we take the natural logarithm of both sides, we find that

:formula_9

Denote the logarithmic derivative by

: formula_10

and the negated second derivative by
:formula_11

We then make what calls a &quot;drastic set of assumptions&quot;, that the root we are looking for, say, formula_12 is a short distance, formula_13 away from our guess formula_14 and all the other roots are all clustered together, at some further distance formula_15 If we denote these distances by
:formula_16
and
: formula_17
or exactly,
: formula_18

then our equation for formula_19 may be written as
:formula_20
and the expression for formula_21 becomes
:formula_22
Solving these equations for formula_13 we find that
:formula_24
where in this case, the square root of the (possibly) complex number is chosen to produce largest absolute value of the denominator and make formula_25 as small as possible; equivalently, it satisfies:
:formula_26
where formula_27 denotes real part of a complex number, and formula_28 is the complex conjugate of formula_29 or
:formula_30
where the square root of a complex number is chosen to have a non-negative real part.

For small values of formula_31 this formula differs from the offset of the third order Halley&#x27;s method by an error of formula_32 so convergence close to a root will be cubic as well. 

===Fallback===
Even if the &quot;drastic set of assumptions&quot; does not work well for some particular polynomial , then can be transformed into a related polynomial for which the assumptions are viable; e.g. by first shifting the origin towards a suitable complex number , giving a second polynomial , that give distinct roots clearly distinct magnitudes, if necessary (which it will be if some roots are complex conjugates).

After that, getting a third polynomial from by repeatedly applying the root squaring transformation from Graeffe&#x27;s method, enough times to make the smaller roots significantly smaller than the largest root (and so, clustered comparatively nearer to zero). The approximate root from Graeffe&#x27;s method, can then be used to start the new iteration for Laguerre&#x27;s method on . An approximate root for may then be obtained straightforwardly from that for .

If we make the even more extreme assumption that the terms in formula_33 corresponding to the roots formula_34 are negligibly small compared to the root formula_35 this leads to Newton&#x27;s method.

==Properties==
If is a simple root of the polynomial formula_36 then Laguerre&#x27;s method converges cubically whenever the initial guess, formula_37 is close enough to the root formula_38 On the other hand, when formula_12 is a multiple root convergence is merely linear, with the penalty of calculating values for the polynomial and its first and second derivatives at each stage of the iteration.

A major advantage of Laguerre&#x27;s method is that it is almost guaranteed to converge to &quot;some&quot; root of the polynomial &quot;no matter where the initial approximation is chosen&quot;. This is in contrast to other methods such as the Newton–Raphson method and Stephensen&#x27;s method, which notoriously fail to converge for poorly chosen initial guesses. Laguerre&#x27;s method may even converge to a complex root of the polynomial, because the radicand of the square root may be of a negative number, in the formula for the correction, formula_13 given above – manageable so long as complex numbers can be conveniently accommodated for the calculation. This may be considered an advantage or a liability depending on the application to which the method is being used.

Empirical evidence shows that convergence failure is extremely rare, making this a good candidate for a general purpose polynomial root finding algorithm. However, given the fairly limited theoretical understanding of the algorithm, many numerical analysts are hesitant to use it as a default, and prefer better understood methods such as the Jenkins–Traub algorithm, for which more solid theory has been developed and whose limits are known.

The algorithm is fairly simple to use, compared to other &quot;sure-fire&quot; methods, and simple enough for hand calculation, aided by a pocket calculator, if a computer is not available. The speed at which the method converges means that one is only very rarely required to compute more than a few iterations to get high accuracy.

<text>America Votes is a 501(c)(4) organization that aims &quot;to coordinate and promote progressive issues.&quot; America Votes leads national and state-based coalitions to advance progressive policies and increase voter turnout for Democratic Party candidates.

America Votes was created prior to the 2004 United States presidential election by Ellen Malcolm, the founder of EMILY&#x27;s List; former Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope; Harold Ickes; Steve Rosenthal; and Andy Stern, the former president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Cecile Richards was the founding president. Greg Speed serves as president of the organization.

==Activities==
America Votes coordinates GOTV and advocacy campaigns in the United States, &quot;helping liberal advocacy groups work together to avoid overlapping efforts&quot;. According to POLITICO, America Votes has &quot;expanded dramatically&quot; since 2020. America Votes is also involved in advocacy efforts to expand access to voting. For example, the organization recently opposed efforts to restrict out of state students from voting in New Hampshire.

==Funding==
America Votes does not disclose its donors. The group raised $12.7 million in 2013, and projects revenue of $8.5 million in 2014. According to the Center for Public Integrity, &quot;Between 40 percent and 50 percent of that sum is projected to come from wealthy donors connected to the Democracy Alliance, a secretive nonprofit whose funders include the likes of billionaire investor George Soros and author, horticulturalist and philanthropist Amy Goldman.&quot;

In 2018, the Sixteen Thirty Fund gave America Votes $27 million. The $27 million grant was nearly twice the amount America Votes had previously ever raised in a single year.

<doc id="1136626" wikidata="Q102720" url="?curid=1136626" title="Hertha BSC">
<text>Hertha, Berliner Sport-Club e. V., commonly known as Hertha BSC () or Hertha Berlin, is a German professional football club based in the locality of Westend of the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf of Berlin. Hertha BSC plays in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of German football, following relegation from the Bundesliga in 2022–23. Hertha BSC was founded in 1892, and was a founding member of the German Football Association in Leipzig in 1900.

The team won the German championship in 1930 and 1931. Since 1963, Hertha&#x27;s stadium has been the Olympiastadion. The club is known as &quot;Die Alte Dame&quot; in German, which translates to &quot;The Old Lady&quot;. In 2002, the sports activities of the professional, amateur, and under-19 teams were separated into &quot;Hertha BSC GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
The club was formed in 1892 as &quot;BFC Hertha 92&quot;, taking its name from a steamship with a blue and white smokestack; one of the four young men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. The name Hertha is a variation on Nerthus, referring to a fertility goddess from Germanic mythology.

Hertha performed consistently well on the field, including a win in the first Berlin championship final in 1905. In May 1910, Hertha won a friendly match against Southend United, which was considered significant at the time, as England was where the game originated and English clubs dominated the sport. However, their on-field success was not matched financially, and in 1920 the staunchly working-class Hertha merged with the well-heeled club Berliner Sport-Club to form &quot;Hertha Berliner Sport-Club&quot;. The new team continued to enjoy considerable success in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, while also enduring a substantial measure of frustration. The team played its way to the German championship final in six consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1931, but was only able to win the title in 1930 and 1931, with BSC leaving to become an independent club again after the combined side&#x27;s first championship. Notwithstanding, Hertha emerged as the Germany&#x27;s second most successful team during the inter-war years.

===Play under the Third Reich===
German football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 top-flight divisions, which saw Hertha playing in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. The club continued to enjoy success within their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and winning the divisional title in 1935, 1937 and 1944. It faded from prominence, however, unable to advance out of the early rounds of the national championship rounds. Politically, the club was overhauled under Hitler, with Hans Pfeifer, a Nazi party member, being installed as president.

===Postwar play===

After World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Hertha was re-formed late in 1945 as &quot;SG Gesundbrunnen&quot; and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin – Gruppe C. The 36 teams of the first season of the post-war Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just a dozen the next year, and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin. By the end of 1949, it had re-claimed their identity as &quot;Hertha BSC&quot; and earned a return to the top-flight.

Tensions between the western Allies and the Soviets occupying various sectors of the city, and the developing Cold War, led to chaotic conditions for football in the capital. Hertha was banned from playing against East German teams in the 1949–50 season after taking on several players and a coach who had fled the Dresden club SG Friedrichstadt for West Berlin. A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR-Liga beginning with the 1950–51 season.

Through the 1950s, an intense rivalry developed with Tennis Borussia Berlin. A proposal for a merger between the two clubs in 1958 was rejected, with only three of the 266 members voting in favour.

Being a major Berlin side, Hertha had fans in the entirety of Berlin, but following the division of the city, supporters in East Berlin found it both difficult and dangerous to follow the team. In interviews with long-time supporter Helmut Klopfleisch, he described his difficulties as a supporter in East Berlin. Klopfleisch came from the district of Pankow, and, attending his first home match as a young boy in 1954, he became an instant supporter. He continued to attend home matches at the stadium, but with the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, this became impossible. Despite this, he did not give up. By this time, Hertha played at the Stadion am Gesundbrunnen, nicknamed &quot;Die Plumpe&quot;. The stadium was located close enough to the Berlin wall for the sounds from the stadium to be heard over the wall. Thus, Klopfleisch and other supporters gathered behind the wall to listen to the home matches. When the crowd at the stadium cheered, Klopfleisch and the others cheered as well. Klopfleisch later came under suspicion from the Stasi, the East German secret police. He was arrested and interrogated on numerous occasions. He also had his passport confiscated and eventually lost his job as an electrician.

===Entry to the Bundesliga===
At the time of the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, Hertha was Berlin&#x27;s reigning champion, and so became an inaugural member of the new professional national league. In spite of finishing clear of the relegation zone, the team was demoted after the 1964–65 season following attempts to bribe players to play in the city under what had become decidedly unpleasant circumstances after the erection of the Berlin Wall. This caused something of a crisis for the Bundesliga which wanted, for political reasons, to continue to have a team in its ranks representing the former capital. Through various machinations, this led to the promotion of SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin, which then delivered the worst-ever performance in Bundesliga history. Hertha managed a return to the premier German league in 1968–69 and developed a solid following, making it Berlin&#x27;s favourite side.

Hertha, however, was again soon touched by scandal through its involvement with several other clubs in the Bundesliga matchfixing scandal of 1971. In the course of an investigation of Hertha&#x27;s role, it was also revealed that the club was 6 million DM in debt. Financial disaster was averted through the sale of the team&#x27;s former home ground.

In spite of this, the team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success on the field through the 1970s with a second place Bundesliga finish behind Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1974–75, a semi-final appearance in the 1978–79 UEFA Cup, and two appearances in the final of the DFB-Pokal (1977 and 1979). The following season saw the fortunes of the team take a turn for the worse as it was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, where it would spend 13 of the next 17 seasons.

Plans in 1982 for a merger with Tennis Borussia Berlin, SpVgg Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin and SCC Berlin to form a side derisively referred to as &quot;FC Utopia&quot; never came to fruition. Hertha slipped as low as the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin, where it spent two seasons (1986–87 and 1987–88). Two turns in the Bundesliga (1982–83 and 1990–91) saw the team immediately relegated after poor performances. Hertha&#x27;s amateur side enjoyed a greater measure of success, advancing to the final of the DFB-Pokal in 1993, where its run ended in a close 0–1 defeat to Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hertha became a popular side in East Berlin as well. Two days after the wall came down, 11,000 East Berliners attended Hertha&#x27;s match against SG Wattenscheid. A fan friendship with Union Berlin developed, and a friendly match between the two attracted over 50,000 spectators.

Financial woes once more burdened the club in 1994, as it accumulated 10 million DM of debt. The crisis was again resolved through the sale of real estate holdings, in addition to the signing of a new sponsor and management team. By 1997, Hertha had returned to the Bundesliga, where it generally managed to finish in the upper-third of the league table. When Hertha was promoted in 1997, it ended Berlin&#x27;s six-year-long drought without a Bundesliga side, which had made the Bundesliga the only top league in Europe without representation from its country&#x27;s biggest city and capital.

===A period of oscillation===

Hertha&#x27;s return to the Bundesliga began well, with a continuous string of appearances in international play in the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League beginning in the 1999 season, and the signing of key players such as Pál Dárdai in 1997 who became Hertha&#x27;s most capped player ever, Sebastian Deisler in 1999 and Brazilian international Marcelinho in 2001, who was named the Bundesliga&#x27;s Player of the Year in 2005. Hertha also invested heavily in its own youth football academy.
Hertha could not maintain its strong run of form, however, and the club&#x27;s next few years saw dramatic highs and lows. The team was almost relegated in the 2003–04 season, but rebounded and finished fourth the following season, missing out on the Champions League when Hannover 96 held it to a draw on the final day, a result which led to Werder Bremen overtaking them for the spot on the final league matchday (as a &quot;thank-you&quot; gesture, Werder sent the Hannover squad 96 bottles of champagne.) In 2005–06, the &quot;Herthaner&quot; finished in sixth position, then qualified for the UEFA Cup after defeating FC Moscow in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, Hertha was eliminated in the first round of the UEFA Cup by Odense BK. In 2006–07, Hertha finished tenth after sacking manager Falko Götz on 11 April. Hertha started the 2007–08 season with new manager Lucien Favre, who had won the Swiss championship in 2006 and 2007 with Zürich. Hertha finished tenth again, but started in the first qualification round of the UEFA Cup via the UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking, making it as far as the group stage of the tournament. After a successful campaign in 2008–09 season, finishing in fourth place and remaining in the title race up until the second to last matchday, the club had a very poor season in 2009–10 season, finishing last in the Bundesliga and suffering relegation.

After spending the 2010–11 season in the 2. Bundesliga, Hertha secured its return to the Bundesliga for 2011–12 by winning 1–0 at MSV Duisburg with three matchdays to play in the season. Hertha, however, finished 16th in the 2011–12 Bundesliga and lost in the relegation playoff to Fortuna Düsseldorf to fall back to the 2. Bundesliga.

In 2012–13, Hertha achieved promotion from the second division as champions for the second time in three seasons. On the opening day of the 2013–14 season, the club beat Eintracht Frankfurt 6–1 at the Olympiastadion to top the Bundesliga table at the end of matchday 1.

On 5 February 2015 Pál Dárdai, Hertha&#x27;s longest serving and most capped player ever with 366 appearances took over as the manager of the main squad. At the halfway point of the 2015–16 Bundesliga season, Hertha lay in third place, its highest position at the winter break since 2008–09. Despite a late-season slump, Hertha still finished in seventh place for the season, its highest finish in the Bundesliga since 2008–09 during which Hertha finished fourth. The seventh-place finish meant the club secured Europa League football for the 2016–17 season by the means of a third round play-off. Hertha lost the third round play-off 3–2 on aggregate to Brøndby, winning the first leg 1–0 in Berlin, but losing the second away tie 3–1, with Teemu Pukki scoring a hat-trick for the Danish side.

In the 2016–17 Bundesliga season, Hertha enjoyed its best ever start to a Bundesliga season in terms of points won during the opening eight matches, losing just one match – away against Bayern Munich – and forcing a draw away against Borussia Dortmund. At the 2016–17 Bundesliga winter break, Hertha stood at third place in the league, with nine wins, three draws and four losses. Hertha finished the season in 6th place and qualified for the 2017–18 Europa League. Their place in the group stage was secured on 27 May 2017, after Borussia Dortmund defeated Eintracht Frankfurt in the 2017 DFB–Pokal final.

===Lars Windhorst&#x27;s era===
In June 2019, Lars Windhorst bought a €125 million stake in the club. On 27 November 2019, Jürgen Klinsmann became the new manager of Hertha BSC, replacing Ante Čović. Klinsmann left the club on 11 February 2020, after only 76 days in charge. Assistant manager Alexander Nouri took interim charge of the team, before the permanent appointment of Bruno Labbadia on 9 April 2020.

In 2020, Windhorst bought an increased stake in the club, bringing his total investment to almost $500 million. But sporting success did not follow.

On 24 January 2021, Labbadia was sacked as Hertha manager, with the club sitting inside the relegation play off places with his replacement being former manager Pál Dárdai. After nine months in charge and steering the club to safety, Dárdai was terminated as manager and replaced with Tayfun Korkut. Korkut was terminated after just four months in charge with the club sitting 17th on the table in the relegation zone. Korkut was replaced with Felix Magath. Magath managed to steer the club to safety as they won the relegation play-off against Hamburger SV 2–1 on aggregate. After avoiding relegation, Magath was replaced with Sandro Schwarz as manager. Within months of Schwarz&#x27;s hiring, however, relations between Hertha and Windhorst had deteriorated to the point where Windhorst no longer wanted anything to do with the club. Schwarz was sacked in April 2023 following a 5–2 loss to Schalke 04 that left Hertha at the bottom of the table. Pál Dárdai took over the head coaching job for the third time but he could not prevent Hertha&#x27;s inevitable relegation , and Hertha were relegated after conceding a 93rd minute equaliser at home to VfL Bochum on Matchday 33.

==Stadium==

Since 1963, Hertha BSC has played its matches in Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion, originally built for the 1936 Summer Olympics.

The stadium has a permanent capacity of 74,649 seats, making it the largest stadium in Germany in terms of seating capacity and the second largest stadium in Germany, behind the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, in terms of total capacity. For certain football matches, such as those against Bayern Munich, the capacity can be temporarily expanded. This is made by the addition of mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.

The stadium underwent major renovations twice, in 1974 and from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the renovations were for the upcoming FIFA World Cup. In the 1974 upgrades, the stadium received a partial roof. It underwent a thorough modernization for the 2006 World Cup. In addition, the colour of the track was changed to blue to match Hertha&#x27;s club colours. In addition to Hertha&#x27;s home games, Olympiastadion serves as one of the home grounds for the Germany national football team, and it hosts concerts, track and field competitions, and the annual DFB-Pokal final. It was also the site for six matches of the 2006 World Cup, including the tournament final.

Hertha played its matches on a sports field on the &quot;Exer&quot; on Schönhauser Allee in Prenzlauer Berg until 1904. This was the first home ground of Hertha. The Exer was a former parade ground of the 1st (Emperor Alexander) Guards Grenadiers and the site is today occupied by the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Hertha then moved it matches to the Schebera-Sportplatz in the locality of Gesundbrunnen in 1904. The Stadion am Gesundbrunnen was built in the area in 1923. The stadium would be nicknamed &quot;Die Plumpe&quot; and had a capacity of 35,000, of which 3,600 seated. Hertha left the stadium when it joined the Bundesliga in 1963. Hertha returned to the site during the Regionalliga years from 1965 to 1968. The sale of the site in 1971 helped the club avoid bankruptcy.

Due to a lack of spectator interest, Hertha played its 2. Bundesliga and Amateurliga matches from 1986 to 1989 at the Poststadion. The opening fixtures of the 1992–93 season, as well as the Intertoto Cup and UEFA Cup qualifying matches, were played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark.

It was confirmed on 23 May 2016 that Hertha will continue to play its home matches at the Olympiastadion until 2025.

===New stadium===
On 30 March 2017, Hertha announced its intentions to build a new 55,000 seater stadium, to be ready in 2025 when their contract to play at the Olympiastadion runs out. The club noted many factors for this decision, one being that the Berlin side are the only club in the Bundesliga without a dedicated football stadium. In the announcement, the club acknowledged that the Olympiastadion was suitable for major national and international matches, but was too large for the average attendance of a Hertha home game, with only 64% seats being sold; opposed to the Bundesliga average of 92%. On the announcement, the club stated that its preferred option was to construct its own stadium, with a survey identifying a suitable site in Berlin&#x27;s Olympic Park close to the Olympiastadion. But, at the same time, Berlin&#x27;s state government indicated a willingness to consider rebuilding the Olympiastadion itself into a football-only venue. However, following the success of the 2018 European Athletics Championships held at the stadium, combined with the potential cost of the conversion, the state government subsequently elected not to proceed, leading Hertha to return to the Olympic Park proposal. However, if that plan was rejected, they also have secondary plans for the stadium to be built in Brandenburg Park, Ludwigsfelde.

==Colours and kit==

Hertha&#x27;s club colours are blue and white which come, like its name, from the Hertha steamship. Traditionally, the club wears these colours as stripes, however, since the 1970s, it has employed many different uniforms. 

Between the 70s and the 90s, a variety of plain shirts or shirts with large blocks of colour were used, and the team rarely wore its traditional stripes. In 1997, Hertha unveiled a strip with navy blue hoops and shorts, which the team wore for two seasons, abandoning its colours and traditional motif. 

The club reintroduced a very traditional kit for the 2000/2001 season, however it continuously flirted with navy uniforms throughout the early 2000s, and navy often appears as part of the home uniform, or as the primary colour of second and third choice strips even today. Since the mid-2000s the club has generally opted for a traditional style of uniform.

The Old Lady also has a historically traditional away kit, being a red and black version of their home.

==Women&#x27;s football==
Missing out on a trend of promoting women&#x27;s football, Hertha became one of a decreasing number of major German football clubs left outside the top of women&#x27;s football. Several steps had been taken to develop women&#x27;s football, but most of them ended up inconclusive. The change came in 2009, when the club announced that it was to launch a cooperation in women&#x27;s football with 1. FC Lübars, a football club from the Berlin borough Reinickendorf and with decades of history in women&#x27;s football.

From one side, the partnership meant that Hertha was to provide Lübars with various forms of support, including financial support, expertise in licensing and sponsor acquisition, equipment and training instruction – investing approximately 1 million Euros in the project. From the other side, the partnership meant that Lübars was to compete in the colours of Hertha, thus earning the nickname &quot;Die Hertha-Frauen&quot; (&quot;The Hertha-women&quot;). In the long run, the club plans for the team of 1. FC Lübars to be integrated with Hertha BSC. 1. FC Lübars now competes in the 2. Bundesliga of women&#x27;s football.

<doc id="1136632" wikidata="Q28154838" url="?curid=1136632" title="Sun-tailed monkey">
<text>The sun-tailed monkey (Allochrocebus solatus) from Gabon is one of the least studied primates in its habitat. It was discovered as a new species in 1988, and is classified as a guenon, which is a member of the genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;, but was subsequently moved to the genus &quot;Allochrocebus&quot;. It is closely related to &quot;A. preussi&quot; and &quot;A. Ihoesti&quot;, which has been determined by chromosomal analysis. Sun-tailed monkeys prefer shady areas with dense vegetation. However, even after small amounts of logging activity, populations can be unaffected. Much of their diet remains unknown and is still being studied, but they are known to prefer fruit. Their social groups are made up of one male and multiple females. Generally, the sun-tailed monkey is less aggressive towards related individuals, which is noteworthy because it has been found that, in other primate species, aggression rates towards related individuals are generally as high or higher than aggression rates towards non-related individuals. Within their social groups, individual monkeys show preference for their mothers over their fathers, and are overall less aggressive to other monkeys that they are associated with spatially.

== Conservation status ==
The Sun-tailed monkey is a Class B protected species under the African Convention and Appendix II of CITES. The Gabonese government gave it protected status in 1994 and some animals are kept there in captivity. Around 10% of the monkey&#x27;s habitat is in the Lopé National Park, but the highest density is at the Foret des Abeilles, which is still unprotected. It is recommended that there should be more monitoring of hunting and logging activity in its habitat, as well as more research into the distribution and biology of the species in general. Occasionally, there have been reports of monkeys raiding crops in local villages. However, there is not much study into how these interactions with humans affect the populations as a whole. 

== Biochemistry ==
As one of the most poorly known nonhuman primate species with only one semi-captive population in the world, not much is known about its genome or biochemistry. However, there has been some research conducted into the blood biochemistry of the animal. Blood analysis of the sun-tailed monkey reveals that males show higher levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit than females. Females, however, showed higher levels of cholesterol and had higher neutrophil counts. In general, as the monkey ages, levels of blood urea increase and albumin protein levels decrease, which suggest declining liver, kidney and muscle function through life.

<text>Verein für Leibesübungen Wolfsburg e. V., commonly known as VfL Wolfsburg (), is a German professional sports club based in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony. The club grew out of a multi-sports club for Volkswagen workers in the city of Wolfsburg. It is best known for its football department, but other departments include badminton, handball and athletics.

The men&#x27;s professional football team play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Wolfsburg have won the Bundesliga once in their history, in the 2008–09 season, the DFB-Pokal in 2015 and the DFL-Supercup in 2015.

Professional football is run by the spin-off organization &quot;VfL Wolfsburg-Fußball GmbH&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. Since 2002, Wolfsburg&#x27;s stadium is the Volkswagen Arena.

==History==
===Foundation===
The city of Wolfsburg was founded in 1938 as Stadt des KdF-Wagen to house autoworkers building the car that would later become famous as the Volkswagen Beetle. The first football club affiliated with the autoworks was known as &quot;BSG Volkswagenwerk Stadt des KdF-Wagen&quot;, a works team. This team played in the first division Gauliga Osthannover in the 1943–44 and 1944–45 seasons.

On 12 September 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, a new club was formed and was known briefly as &quot;VSK Wolfsburg&quot;. This side began play in the green and white still worn by &quot;VfL&quot; today; local youth trainer Bernd Elberskirch had ten green jerseys at his disposal and white bed sheets donated by the public were sewn together by local women to make shorts.

On 15 December 1945, the club went through a crisis that almost ended its existence when all but one of its players left to join &quot;1. FC Wolfsburg&quot;. The only player remaining, Josef Meyer, worked with Willi Hilbert to rebuild the side by signing new players. The new group adopted the moniker &quot;VfL Wolfsburg&quot;, VfL standing for Verein für Leibesübungen. This can be translated as &quot;club for gymnastics&quot; or &quot;club for exercises&quot;. Within a year they captured the local Gifhorn title. In late November 1946, the club played a friendly against longtime Gelsenkirchen powerhouse Schalke 04 at the stadium owned by Volkswagen, emerging as the successor to &quot;BSG&quot; as the company sponsored side.

===Postwar play===

The club made slow but steady progress in the following seasons. They captured a number of amateur level championships, but were unable to advance out of the promotion playoffs until finally breaking through to the top tier Oberliga Nord in 1954 with a 2–1 victory over Heider SV. Wolfsburg, however, struggled in the top flight, narrowly missing relegation each season until finally being sent down in 1959. When Germany&#x27;s first professional football league, the Bundesliga, was formed in 1963, Wolfsburg was playing in the Regionalliga Nord (II), having just moved up from the Verbandsliga Niedersachsen (III), reaching the German Amateur Championship Final that same year (0–1 vs. VfB Stuttgart Amat.).

===Second division and advance to the Bundesliga===
Wolfsburg remained a second division fixture over the next dozen years with their best performance being a second-place finish in 1970. That finish earned the club entry to the promotion round playoffs for the Bundesliga, where they performed poorly and were unable to advance. From the mid-1970s through to the early 1990s, Wolfsburg played as a third division side in the Amateur Oberliga Nord. Consecutive first-place finishes in 1991 and 1992, followed by success in the promotion playoffs, saw the club advance to the 2. Bundesliga for the 1992–93 season.

Wolfsburg continued to enjoy some success through the 1990s. The team advanced to the final of the German Cup in 1995 where they were beaten 0–3 by Borussia Mönchengladbach, but then went on to the top flight on the strength of a second-place league finish in 1997.

Early predictions were that the club would immediately be sent back down, but instead, Wolfsburg developed into a mid-table Bundesliga side. In the 1998–99 season, Wolfsburg, under Wolfgang Wolf, were holding onto the fifth spot in the 33rd round of fixtures, and they had hopes of making fourth place, to gain UEFA Champions League participation. Losing 6–1 away to MSV Duisburg in the final fixture, Wolfsburg finished in sixth place with 55 points and qualified for next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. They also qualified for the Intertoto Cup in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005, enjoying their best run in 2003 after reaching the final in which they lost to Italian side Perugia. This was followed by a couple of seasons of little success for the club, just narrowly avoiding relegation with two 15th-place finishes in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons.

===2008–present===

For the 2007–08 season, the club hired former Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath, with whom they managed to finish in fifth place at the end of the season, the highest finish for the club at the time. This also enabled the Wolves to qualify for the UEFA Cup for only the second time in their history.

In the 2008–09 season, under Magath, Wolfsburg claimed their biggest success by winning their first Bundesliga title after defeating Werder Bremen 5–1 on 23 May 2009. During this campaign, Wolfsburg equalled the longest winning streak in one Bundesliga season with ten successive victories after the winter break. They also became the only team in the Bundesliga to have had two strikers scoring more than 20 goals each in one season, with Brazilian Grafite and Bosnian Edin Džeko achieving this feat in their title-winning season, scoring 28 and 26, respectively, with Zvjezdan Misimović adding a record 20 assists. As a result of their title win, Wolfsburg qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.

In the 2009–10 season, Wolfsburg dismissed their newly appointed trainer Armin Veh after the winter break due to lack of success, with the club sitting tenth in the league. In the Champions League, they came third in their group, behind Manchester United and CSKA Moscow, losing the chance for a place in the competition&#x27;s successive round. As a result, they qualified for the Round of 32 phase of the UEFA Europa League. They defeated Spanish side Villarreal 6–3 on aggregate and Russian champions Rubin Kazan 3–2. In the quarter-finals, however, they were beaten 3–1 by eventual finalists Fulham.

On 11 May 2010, the permanent head coach&#x27;s position was filled by former England manager Steve McClaren. After having guided Twente to their first ever Dutch title, he was rewarded by becoming the first English coach to manage a Bundesliga side. On 7 February 2011, however, it was announced that McClaren had been sacked and that Pierre Littbarski would be taking over. Wolfsburg lost four times in five matches under him and they finally slipped into the relegation places.

On 18 March 2011, Wolfsburg confirmed that Felix Magath would return as head coach and sporting director, almost two years since he led them to the Bundesliga title and just two days after being fired from his position at Schalke 04. He signed a two-year contract with the club. Magath steered the club to safety, but though the club invested heavily, Magath could only achieve a mid-table finish in the following 2011–12 season. After only five points in eight matches (and no goals and points in the last four games) in the 2012–13 season, Magath left the club by mutual consent, and was temporarily replaced by former Wolfsburg reserve team coach Lorenz-Günther Köstner. On 22 December 2012, the former 1. FC Nürnberg head coach Dieter Hecking was appointed as Wolfsburg&#x27;s new head coach on a contract lasting until 2016.

On 2 February 2015, Wolfsburg purchased the German international forward André Schürrle for a fee of €30 million from Chelsea. With a reinforced squad, the club finished as runners-up in the 2014–15 Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich, thus automatically qualifying for the 2015–16 Champions League group stage. On 30 May, the team then won the 2015 DFB-Pokal Final 3–1 against Borussia Dortmund, the first German Cup victory in the history of the club.

On 1 August, to begin the 2015–16 season, Wolfsburg defeated the Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich in the 2015 DFL-Supercup on penalties. At the end of the 2015 summer transfer window, Wolfsburg sold the 2014–15 Footballer of the Year (Germany) Kevin De Bruyne to Manchester City for a reported Bundesliga record fee of €75 million.

The 2015–16 campaign saw Wolfsburg finish in eighth place. The Bundesliga match between Bayern and Wolfsburg saw an extraordinary five goals in nine minutes by Robert Lewandowski. In the Champions League, they reached the quarter-finals for the first time, where they faced Real Madrid and, despite a two-goal aggregate lead from the first match, were eliminated after losing 3–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.

In January 2017, Wolfsburg signed a letter of intent to partner the American side Chattanooga FC, which includes women&#x27;s football, youth development and local social responsibility. The two teams mentioned the future possibility of international friendlies.

Wolfsburg struggled through the 2016–17 season, rotating through several managers and eventually finishing in 16th place in the Bundesliga with only 37 points, putting them in a playoff against Eintracht Braunschweig, which they won 2–0 on aggregate to remain in the top flight.

The 2017–18 season proved to be another disappointing season, in which they finished 16th place in the Bundesliga, putting them in a play-off against Holstein Kiel, a game that they won 4–1 on aggregate.

In the 2018–19 season, Wolfsburg finished 6th in the Bundesliga, thus automatically qualifying for the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League.

In the draw for the Europa League third qualifying round, Wolfsburg drew the Ukrainian Team Desna Chernihiv. Wolfsburg won 2–0 at the AOK Stadion, advancing to the play-off round. At the play-off round they lost 2–1 against AEK Athens.

On 24 May 2022, Niko Kovač was appointed as Wolfsburg&#x27;s new head coach, with a contract lasting until June 2025, prematurely terminated in March 2024.

==Home stadium==
Wolfsburg plays at the Volkswagen Arena, a multi-purpose stadium which seats a total capacity of 30,000 spectators. Before construction was finished in 2002, Wolfsburg played their home games at the 21,600 capacity VfL-Stadium. The stadium is currently used mostly for the home games of Wolfsburg, and is the site where they won their first Bundesliga title in the 2008–09 season. The amateur squad and the women&#x27;s association football section is playing since 2015 at the newly built AOK Stadion with a capacity of 5200 people. There is also a new VfL-Center with offices and training areas and the VfL-FußballWelt, an interactive exhibition about the VfL.

<doc id="1136644" wikidata="Q584155" url="?curid=1136644" title="Sonny Barger">
<text>Ralph Hubert &quot;Sonny&quot; Barger Jr. (October 8, 1938 – June 29, 2022) was an American outlaw biker who was a founding member of the Oakland, California chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in 1957. After forming the Oakland chapter, Barger was instrumental in unifying various disparate Hells Angels chapters and had the club incorporated in 1966. He emerged as the Hells Angels&#x27; most prominent member during the counterculture era and was reputed by law enforcement and media to be the club&#x27;s international president, an allegation he repeatedly denied. The author Hunter S. Thompson called Barger &quot;the Maximum Leader&quot; of the Hells Angels, and Philip Martin of the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; described him as &quot;the archetypical Hells Angel&quot;, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t found the motorcycle club ... but he constructed the myth&quot;. Barger authored five books, and appeared on television and in film.

Barger served a total of 13 years in prison, following a conviction for heroin trafficking in 1974, and a 1988 conviction for conspiracy to bomb the clubhouse of a rival motorcycle gang, the Outlaws. He was also acquitted of murder in 1972, and of racketeering in 1980. Barger rejected accusations from law enforcement characterizing the Hells Angels as an organized crime syndicate, and maintained that the club should not be held accountable for crimes committed by individual members.

== Early life ==
Ralph Hubert Barger Jr. was born in Modesto, California, on October 8, 1938, the son of Kathryn Carmella (née Ritch) and Ralph Hubert Barger. His father had German and Dutch ancestry, and his mother was of Italian descent. His mother left the family when Barger was four months old, leaving him and his older sister Shirley to be raised by their Pentecostal grandmother and alcoholic father, a day laborer on the Oakland docks. Barger grew up in Oakland in the post-war era, during which time the city&#x27;s shipbuilding and automobile industries went into decline, leading to a significant rise in unemployment.

Growing up, Barger was suspended from school several times for assaulting teachers, and he often fought with other boys. He dropped out of school in the tenth grade. Although many of his school friends became drug addicts, Barger worked at a grocery store and enlisted in the U.S. Army, aged sixteen in 1955. He was given an honorable discharge fourteen months later when it was discovered that he had forged his birth certificate in order to be able to join. Barger had liked the discipline, masculine camaraderie, and learning how to disassemble weapons. After his return from the Army, Barger drifted between menial jobs and lived with his father in a single residence at a hotel, later moving in with his sister and her children.

== Hells Angels ==

In 1956, Barger joined his first motorcycle club, the Oakland Panthers, which he founded with a group of fellow military veterans. After that club disbanded, he started riding with another group of bikers, one of whom, Don &quot;Boots&quot; Reeves, wore a patch that belonged to a defunct Nomads chapter of the Hells Angels in North Sacramento. Founding their own Hells Angels club on April 1, 1957, each member wore the patch – a small skull wearing an aviator cap set within a set of wings, later copyrighted as the Hells Angels&#x27; &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; logo – after having replicas made at a trophy store in Hayward.

Barger was not the founder of the Hells Angels as is often claimed – the group was founded in 1948 – but he became its best known member to such an extent that he is often misidentified as the club&#x27;s founder. He and the Oakland Hells Angels were initially unaware that there were several other, loosely affiliated clubs using the same name throughout California. The founding members of the Oakland Hells Angels were &quot;basically honest blue-collar or unskilled workers looking for excitement&quot;, according to George &quot;Baby Huey&quot; Wethern, who became the chapter vice president in 1960. Unlike the World War II veterans who formed the early Hells Angels chapters, many of the founding members of the Oakland chapter were former servicemen with disreputable military records. Barger described his chapter as a &quot;wild bunch&quot;.

After a chance encounter with a member of a pre-existing Hells Angels chapter, Barger learned of the club&#x27;s history, rules, regulations and procedures. He was appointed president of the Oakland chapter in 1958 following a series of meetings with Hells Angels from Southern California. With Barger as president, the Oakland Hells Angels traveled around California and amalgamated with the other Hells Angels chapters, dividing territory and forming club bylaws. While infighting did occur between the chapters, conflicts predominantly arose with other clubs such as the Gypsy Jokers.

When Otto Friedli, the founder of the original San Bernardino Hells Angels chapter, was imprisoned in 1958, Barger was proclaimed &quot;de facto&quot; national president. One of his first actions was to relocate the club&#x27;s &quot;mother chapter&quot; – the national headquarters – from San Bernardino to Oakland. Later that year, Barger suffered a fractured skull during a fight with Oakland police. Although the basic organization was in place when Barger assumed leadership of the club, he introduced additional rules pertaining to new members, club officers, and the establishment of new chapters. Under Barger&#x27;s leadership, the club&#x27;s membership began to increase. By 1960, the Oakland Hells Angels had established an extensive narcotics network within the club. Some of Barger&#x27;s rules included &quot;no using dope during a meeting&quot; and &quot;no drug burns&quot; (rip-offs). The Hells Angels worked as &quot;part-time distributors&quot; of drugs in the 1950s and early 1960s.

According to George Wethern – who left the Hells Angels in 1972 and went on to testify against the club before entering the Federal Witness Protection Program – in his 1978 book &quot;A Wayward Angel&quot;, Barger convened a meeting of the leaders of the Hells Angels and other California motorcycle clubs in 1960 in which the various clubs parleyed over the mutual problem of police harassment. The clubs voted to ally under a &quot;1%&quot; patch to be worn on their respective &quot;colors&quot;. The term refers to a comment allegedly made by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens, implying the last one percent were outlaws. In 1961, Barger opened the first Hells Angels chapter abroad in New Zealand.

The Oakland chapter, with Barger serving as its president, assumed an informal position of authority within the Hells Angels that began following a confrontation with local police and the California Highway Patrol in the aftermath of an outlaw motorcycle meeting in Porterville in September 1963. Although always a predominantly male organization, the Hells Angels had female members until 1964 when Barger imposed a rule making the club male only. He justified the male-only rule on the grounds that female Hells Angels were less able to defend themselves against rival bikers seeking to steal their patches. Barger was employed as a machine operator from 1960 to 1965, when he was dismissed due to extended absences. His criminal record began in 1963 after he was arrested for possession of marijuana. He was arrested again on the same charge the following year, and for assault with a deadly weapon in 1965 and 1966. In the 1965 incident, he forced his pistol into a bar patron&#x27;s mouth after the man had made disparaging remarks about the Hells Angels. Barger claims the gun fired by accident, but wrote in his 2000 autobiography &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club&quot;: &quot;since the motherfucker was already shot in the head, I bent him over the pool table and shot him again&quot;. Barger was convicted of assault with the intent to murder. When a rival club of bikers stole Barger&#x27;s motorcycle, he and his members assaulted them with spiked dog collars, whipped them with bullwhips, and then used ballpeen hammers to break their fingers.

The Oakland Hells Angels maintained a prominent position as &quot;first among equals&quot; by having the largest membership of any U.S. chapter and because of Barger&#x27;s esteem among club members internationally. The author and journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote in his 1967 book &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; that &quot;in any gathering of Hell&#x27;s Angels, there is no doubt who is running the show&quot;, describing Barger as &quot;a 6-foot, 170-pound warehouseman from East Oakland, the coolest head in the lot, and a tough, quick-thinking dealer when any action starts&quot;, and saying of him: &quot;By turns he is a fanatic, a philosopher, a brawler, a shrewd compromiser and a final arbitrator.&quot; Barger continually denied that he was the Hells Angels&#x27; leader or that Oakland was the club&#x27;s headquarters, however, saying: &quot;There’s no charter that&#x27;s the boss. That&#x27;s all cops and newspapers.&quot;

=== Counterculture era ===
Barger and the Hells Angels, many of whom were military veterans, considered themselves anti-communist and anti-subversive patriots. In 1964, Barger and another Hells Angel, Michael &quot;Tiny&quot; Walters, told an &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; columnist: &quot;Our oath is allegiance to the United States of America. If there should be trouble we would jump to enlist and fight. More than 90 per cent of our members are veterans. We don&#x27;t want no slackers.&quot; When students at the University of California, Berkeley announced an anti-Vietnam War rally, the Oakland Hells Angels denounced the rally as &quot;a despicable un-American activity&quot;. On October 16, 1965, Barger led a group of Hells Angels in an attack on anti-war demonstrators marching from Berkeley to the Army Terminal in Oakland to protest against munitions shipments. The Oakland police reportedly stood aside and let the attack commence, whereas the Berkeley police intervened to stop the bikers from assaulting the protesters. Six Hells Angels members were arrested and a Berkeley police sergeant suffered a broken leg in the brawl. The Angels maintained that the attack was done &quot;in the interest of public safety and the protection of the good name of Oakland, California.&quot;

The incident led to a collection of students, left-wing political organizations, and labor unions led by Allen Ginsberg and Jerry Rubin meeting with motorcycle club representatives, headed by the president of the Sacramento Hells Angels chapter, in a cafeteria at San Jose State University. Ginsberg and Rubin sought assurance that a planned Vietnam Day Committee protest march in Oakland on November 20, 1965, would not be disturbed. Ginsberg invited Barger and the Oakland Hells Angels to a party where he provided the bikers with free alcohol, drugs, and sex in exchange for their guarantee that the rally would not be attacked. On November 19, 1965, five Hells Angels led by Barger held a press conference at their bail bondsman&#x27;s office, announcing that the club would not attend the protest the following day as &quot;Any physical encounter would only produce sympathy for this mob of traitors&quot;, according to Barger. He went on to read aloud a telegram sent to President Lyndon B. Johnson, stating: &quot;I volunteer a group of loyal Americans for duty behind the line in Vietnam. We feel that a crack group of trained guerillas could demoralize the Viet Cong and advance the cause of freedom.&quot; President Johnson did not reply to the letter.

After the spate of publicity the Hells Angels received in 1965, Barger had the club&#x27;s name copyrighted. The Hells Angels were incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1966. Barger and the Hells Angels became associated with the counterculture phenomenon of the 1960s. Between 1966 and 1973, the majority of his legitimate personal income was derived from consulting various film projects. He acted as a technical advisor on a series of outlaw biker films beginning with Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966). Onscreen, Barger was identified but did not speak in &quot;Hells Angels on Wheels&quot; (1967) and was one of several members of the Angels who had speaking parts playing themselves in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels &#x27;69&quot; (1969); he appeared in several additional films. Barger features prominently in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;. He was unimpressed with Thompson, and said of the writer: &quot;When he tried to act tough with us, no matter what happened, Hunter Thompson got scared. I ended up not liking him at all, a tall skinny, typical hillbilly from Kentucky. He was a total fake.&quot; Barger and the Hells Angels are also depicted in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), during Ken Kesey&#x27;s La Honda encampment. Using his fame, Barger opened a chapter in Omaha, Nebraska in 1966, which, besides the chapter in New Zealand, was the first Hells Angel chapter outside of California. In 1967, Barger opened a Hells Angel chapter in Lowell, Massachusetts, which was the first Hells Angel chapter on the East Coast.

During the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in San Francisco in 1967, the Hells Angels began to sell PCP, which came to be known as &quot;Dust of the Angels&quot; or DOA for short. PCP came to be popular with the hippies during the &quot;Summer of Love,&quot; owing to its ability to cause hallucinations, and the Angels came to dominate the market for PCP in the Bay Area. Barger later admitted that besides selling PCP, his chapter &quot;used to move most of the LSD&quot; in the San Francisco area. Selling PCP made the Hells Angels wealthy for the first time, and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Tim McKinley, who often investigated Hells Angels-related cases, it was in 1967 that the Hells Angels become a major criminal organization in their own right. Prior to 1967, the Angels had been used as subcontractors for other criminal organizations who used them to distribute cocaine and marijuana. With PCP, the Angels created a vertical monopoly.

As PCP lost popularity, the Hells Angels switched to selling methamphetamine, a market that they have dominated ever since. Barger recruited Kenny Maxwell, a former chemist for the Royal Dutch Shell oil company, who taught the Hells Angels how to make methamphetamine. In 1967, Barger enlisted Clarence &quot;Butch&quot; Crouch, a biker from Shreveport, Louisiana, and utilized him to form a Hells Angels chapter in Cleveland. In December 1967, Barger visited Ohio to oversee the merger of two Cleveland biker gangs to form a local Hells Angels chapter. Barger ordered Crouch to eliminate other biker gangs in order to conquer the methamphetamine market in the Cleveland area.

For at least five years beginning in 1967, Barger and the Hells Angels surrendered hundreds of guns and hundreds of pounds of explosives, as well as the locations of caches of weapons and narcotics, to the Oakland Police Department in exchange for the release of jailed Hells Angels members and other considerations from authorities. Oakland and Berkeley suffered a spate of approximately 80 bombings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and police made the arrangement with the Hells Angels in order to acquire black market weapons which could otherwise be used by &quot;subversives&quot; such as Black Panther Party and Weather Underground radicals. The Angels were dealing in weapons which were stolen from armories and gun stores, or smuggled from abroad. Oakland police sergeant Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Hilliard testified in 1972 that he accepted guns, dynamite, and grenades from Barger personally in return for deals on arrests during at least fifteen separate meetings, the most recent of which occurred in the spring of 1971. Hilliard also testified that Barger had offered &quot;to deliver the bagged body of a leftist for every Angel released from jail&quot;, an offer Hilliard refused as it &quot;was absolutely out of the question&quot;. Barger denied ever making such an offer. Hilliard insisted, however, that authorities had not permitted crimes committed by the Hells Angels.

The first internal murder of a Hells Angels member sanctioned by the club was allegedly carried out when Paul &quot;German&quot; Ingalls, a member of the Oakland chapter who had previously transferred from the Omaha charter, was found guilty of burglarizing Barger&#x27;s valuable coin collection by a six-man kangaroo court at the home of a Hells Angel on February 1, 1968. Ingalls was forced to ingest a large quantity of barbiturates until he suffered a fatal overdose.

In the late 1960s, Barger began selling heroin and also developed an addiction to cocaine. He was described as being &quot;totally crazed on cocaine&quot; for a time. Barger was allegedly the main distributor of cocaine and heroin in the East Bay area. He was among 33 members of the Oakland chapter arrested on drug charges after police raided a bar and a duplex apartment in the city on August 30, 1968. $7,000 worth of heroin and $2,500 worth of other narcotics were confiscated, as were firearms — including an M16 rifle, two shotguns, and an M1 carbine – and a large cache of ammunition, knives, chains, and suspected stolen merchandise. On July 30, 1969, Barger opened up the first Hells Angel chapter in Europe with a chapter being founded in London, followed by another in Zürich in 1970. In 1969, he opened up Hells Angels chapters in New York, Salem and Rochester, giving the Angels a strong presence in the Northeast.

==== Altamont Free Concert ====
Barger was one of the Hells Angels present at the Rolling Stones&#x27; Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969, at which the bikers were reportedly given $500 of beer to provide security. Concert goers and musicians alike were subjected to violence from the Hells Angels, including Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane, who was knocked unconscious, and audience member Meredith &quot;Murdock&quot; Hunter, who was stabbed to death. Barger admitted in his autobiography that the Hells Angels had &quot;beat the fuck out of them&quot; (the people attending the concert). One of the Hells Angels pointed a gun at Keith Richards when he wanted to leave the stage owing to the violence in front of him. Barger claimed to have been sitting on stage drinking beer when the violence was taking place. As a result of critical media attention given to the Hells Angels after the concert, Barger went on KSAN, a local Bay Area radio station, to justify the actions of the Hells Angels and to present their side of the story. He asserted that violence only started once the crowd began vandalizing the Angels&#x27; motorcycles.

Barger would later state that Hunter fired a shot that struck a Hells Angels member with what he described as &quot;just a flesh wound.&quot; Barger maintained that the Rolling Stones were ultimately responsible for the violent events that took place at the concert, saying: &quot;They agitated the crowd, had the stage built too low, and then used us to keep the whole thing boiling. They got exactly what they wanted – a dark scary atmosphere to play &#x27;Sympathy for the Devil&#x27; ... Just because you sing well doesn&#x27;t mean you can act like a bunch of assholes to your fans – and that&#x27;s what they did that night at Altamont&quot;.

He blamed the Rolling Stones&#x27; extended delay before making an onstage appearance for worsening the hostility of the crowd, and said the Hells Angels refused to act as bodyguards for &quot;a bunch of sissy, marble-mouthed prima donnas&quot; when the band asked the bikers to escort them to the stage. He also claimed that he stuck a gun into Keith Richards&#x27; side, to force the Rolling Stones to keep on playing through the riot despite the band&#x27;s misgivings. Barger took umbrage with what he felt was the Stones&#x27; refusal to take responsibility for the catastrophe and he said in the days after the concert: &quot;... Mick Jagger, like, put it all on us. He used us for dupes&quot;.

Barger appears in the documentary film about the Altamont Free Concert, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970). Reflecting on the Altamont concert, which has been referred to variously as &quot;the end of the hippie dream&quot; and &quot;the day the Sixties died&quot;, Barger wrote in his autobiography: &quot;All that shit about Altamont being the end of an era was a bunch of intellectual crap. The death of Aquarius. Bullshit, it was the end of nothing ... Altamont may have been some big catastrophe to the hippies, but it was just another Hells Angels event to me&quot;.

After Altamont, Barger sought to expand the Hells Angels and improve the club&#x27;s image. Members who were of little value to the Hells Angels were drummed out, and intravenous drug use was banned by the club. Barger also stripped the Hells Angels&#x27; &quot;colors&quot; of offensive patches, such as Nazi regalia and various colored wings awarded to members as a reward for sexual adventures performed in the presence of other members. The club also hired public relations specialists and began participating in charity fund drives.

The dispute between the Hells Angels and the Rolling Stones was compounded when the band refused to compensate the Angels for $50,000 in legal fees accrued by the club in the trial of Alan Passaro, who was acquitted of Meredith Hunter&#x27;s murder on the grounds of self-defense. In March 1983, Clarence Crouch, a founding member of the Hells Angels&#x27; Cleveland chapter, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the club had an &quot;open contract&quot; on members of the Rolling Stones and had made two failed attempts on the life of Mick Jagger. Barger subsequently called a press conference to deny Crouch&#x27;s testimony. He again refuted the claims of a murder contract on Jagger in an interview with the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; in 1992, saying: &quot;I personally don&#x27;t like the guy, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want him dead. There are seven [Hells Angels] chapters in England and he comes over here a lot. If there was a contract out on him, then he&#x27;d be dead. It&#x27;s that simple, he wouldn&#x27;t still be singing.&quot;

=== &quot;Gangster era&quot; ===
Barger referred to the 1970s as &quot;a gangster era for&quot; the Hells Angels, writing in his autobiography: &quot;The other clubs tried to take our [reputation] from us. The Blacks and Latinos didn&#x27;t like us. White people were scared of us. Hippies no longer dug us. Rednecks couldn&#x27;t stand us either. Everybody hated us. We became isolated&quot;. During this period, Barger&#x27;s main lieutenants were Sergey Walton, James &quot;Jim-Jim&quot; Brandes and Kenneth &quot;K.O.&quot; Owen. A police report from April 1970 stated: &quot;The subject [Barger] is influential with motorcycle clubs all across the nation. Barger has been unemployed for years and yet is seen with large amounts of money. The money may come from dues he collected from his own chapter and the franchise money he obtains from chapter charters he has sold in various states. It is known that all Hells Angels deal extensively in the narcotic trade&quot;.

On April 11, 1970, Barger was arrested on narcotics charges after Donald Howarth, a film studio property manager and 1967 Mr. America from Studio City, was apprehended while walking towards Barger&#x27;s home with a suitcase containing 17 ounces of cocaine and 30 ounces of heroin, with an estimated retail worth of $350,000. Barger temporarily resigned as president of the Oakland chapter in June 1970 to fight the charges, but returned to the position within months after his successor, John &quot;Johnny Angel&quot; Palomar, was sentenced to a ten-year prison term for shooting a bartender. The drug charges against Barger were later dismissed. He was, however, sentenced to ninety days in jail after walking out of a court session. Howarth was convicted and sentenced to serve five years-to-life in prison.

On January 22, 1972, Barger and four other Hells Angels – Russell Beyea, Bobby &quot;Durt&quot; England, &quot;Oakland&quot; Gary Popkin and Bert Stefanson – were traveling through Redwood Regional Park in two cars, a Pontiac and a Cadillac, when they were pursued in a high-speed chase by park rangers, who suspected the occupants of the vehicles of poaching. The Pontiac struck a tree after its tires were shot out by pursuing park rangers, and England and Stefanson fled into the brush only to be apprehended later. Discovered in the trunk of the Pontiac were three club &quot;prospects&quot; – William Hood, Russell Huddleston and Danny Jarman. Hood and Jarman had been bound, gagged and beaten, while Huddleston had survived having his throat cut. Barger, Beyea and Popkin were arrested after the Cadillac was chased for four miles by converging police. Various objects were thrown from the Cadillac during the pursuit, including four handguns, a shotgun, surgical gloves, and a belt with an ammunition pouch and a silver buckle engraved with the caption: &quot;Sonny Barger Jr., 1957–67 president, Hells Angels Oakland.&quot;

Barger and the others were charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, and assault with a deadly weapon. Hood and Jarman told police that the incident was merely an initiation hazing. Amidst claims by the Hells Angels&#x27; attorneys, Jack Berman and Herman Mintz, of insufficient evidence and an illegal search by arresting officers, all five defendants pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of unlawful imprisonment.

Along with fellow Hells Angels members Sergey Walton, Donald Duane &quot;Whitey&quot; Smith, and &quot;Oakland&quot; Gary Popkin, Barger was charged with the May 21, 1972 murder of Servio Winston Agero — a drug dealer from McAllen, Texas, who had traveled to Oakland with a consignment of narcotics for sale – which allegedly occurred following a dispute over an $80,000 cocaine deal. A prosecution witness, Richard Ivaldi, testified that he witnessed Barger shoot Agero dead as he slept at the home of an absent acquaintance, and that Barger subsequently ordered the others to set fire to the residence. According to Barger&#x27;s chief attorney James Crew, Ivaldi himself was involved in the conspiracy to kill Agero and, knowing he was a prime suspect and fearing retaliation from the &quot;Texas Mafia&quot;, he tried to shift the blame to the Hells Angels. Barger was also provided with an alibi from his girlfriend, Sharon Gruhlke, who claimed she was in bed with him at the time of the murder. The killing of Agero was one of five possibly linked murders committed in the area around that time. Three men — drug dealers Kelly Patrick Smith, Willard Thomas and Gary Kemp, an acquaintance of Ivaldi — were found shot to death in a house near San Leandro the day after Agero&#x27;s murder, and the body of a woman, Karen S. Long, was discovered in the trunk of a car in Oakland on May 26, 1972. Ivaldi had led investigating detectives to the location of the automobile in which Long&#x27;s corpse was found. John Joseph Devaney, Long&#x27;s former husband, was also found dead in a car in Hayward on June 14, 1972, in an apparent suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.

During the trial, Ted Hilliard, Barger&#x27;s handler in the Oakland police, and Barger himself testified that he had been cooperating with police for over five years in return for deals on arrests, bail reductions and other considerations. Barger explained: &quot;If we come into possession of guns and explosives, we don&#x27;t like to keep them around. We turn them in hoping they — the police — will do something for us&quot;. He also admitted being a drug dealer under questioning from the prosecutor in the case, District Attorney Don Whyte. On December 29, 1972, Barger and his three co-defendants were acquitted following a seven-week trial after Ivaldi&#x27;s credibility came under scrutiny.

In December 1972, police bypassed a six-foot fence and Doberman Pinscher guard dogs to raid Barger&#x27;s home in the Oakland Hills, finding eight guns throughout the house and an unidentified human skull on a dresser. At Barger&#x27;s trial for narcotics and weapons offenses in February 1973, the jury was read Barger&#x27;s testimony from his 1972 murder trial in which he admitted to dealing drugs. On March 16, 1973, he was sentenced to a prison term of ten years-to-life after he was convicted of possession of narcotics for sale (37 grams of heroin), and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. His future wife Sharon was a co-defendant; her case ended in a mistrial when a jury failed to reach a verdict. As a result of his imprisonment, Barger was forced to relinquish his presidency of the Oakland chapter for the first time since its inception. According to police intelligence reports, he had designated San Jose chapter president Fillmore Cross as his international successor during a motorcycle run at Bass Lake prior to his imprisonment. Cross was also imprisoned, for possession of amphetamines in 1975, and Barger allegedly continued to lead the Hells Angels from his cell at Folsom State Prison.

Hells Angels and members of other motorcycle gangs formed a clique in the California state prison system which acted somewhat autonomously from the Aryan Brotherhood, the dominant white prison gang in California. One prison official described the status of bikers in the prison system as: &quot;They originally stay out of things. They provide a balance in the racial conflicts. When trouble starts with the Chicanos or the blacks, the Angels join up with the other whites&quot;. Barger befriended Mike &quot;Acha&quot; Ison, a leader in the Mexican Mafia, at Folsom.

Barger began studying sociology in prison. During his incarceration, a bikers&#x27; magazine ran a &quot;Free Sonny Barger&quot; campaign, selling T-shirts and bumper stickers, which helped pay his legal expenses. Barger gave a series of interviews, including one with Geraldo Rivera for his &quot;Good Night America&quot; television program, in which he portrayed himself as a model prisoner and said: &quot;They got to let me out sometime.&quot; In April 1977, Barger won an appeal to face a retrial on a prior marijuana possession conviction.

His acquittal in that case made him eligible for parole as the California Supreme Court ruled that a five-year waiting period – attached to his sentence due to the prior marijuana conviction – was unconstitutional. He was paroled on November 3, 1977, after serving four-and-a-half years of his sentence. On December 5, 1977, Barger opened the first Hells Angels chapter in Canada in Montreal and awarded the Canadian Hells Angels national president Yves &quot;Le Boss&quot; Buteau the right to wear a Hells Angels jacket with the word &quot;International&quot; written on the bottom – a great honor within the world of the Hells Angels where jackets normally list only the state in which the Hells Angel lives in. On October 28, 1978, Barger opened the first Hells Angels chapter in the Netherlands with Willem van Boxtel serving as the president of the Amsterdam chapter. The Amsterdam chapter under Boxtel&#x27;s leadership was to become the most powerful Hells Angel chapter in Europe.

Barger was arrested on a parole violation charge of possession of firearms when police officers discovered a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol, a .38 caliber revolver, and a rifle after arriving at his Oakland home on March 27, 1978, to serve a subpoena and to conduct a parole search. The case was dismissed when Barger&#x27;s wife Sharon testified that the guns belonged to her, not her husband.

=== RICO trial ===
Barger and his wife were among 33 members and associates of the Hells Angels&#x27; Oakland, San Francisco, Marin County, San Jose, Los Angeles, and Vallejo chapters indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statutes on June 13, 1979. He and fifteen others were arrested during a series of raids carried out in the Bay Area by around 200 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents. The indictments followed two car bombings targeting law enforcement officers in Northern California, which were blamed on the Hells Angels. The bombings prompted the California Department of Justice to issue a warning to police departments that the Angels were engaged on a campaign to eliminate law enforcement personnel who investigated their drug activities.

The RICO case against the Hells Angels was the most substantial effort in federal history against the club at the time, and charged the defendants with various crimes dating back to 1971, including manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine; conspiring to commit murder; assault; use of false identification; intimidation; and bribery. Barger was held on a $1 million bail and spent 14 months in San Francisco County Jail before and during the trial. In a jailhouse interview with Cynthia Gorney of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in October 1979, Barger stated: &quot;I can tell you why they want to get rid of the Hells Angels, what I think. First of all we&#x27;re a virtual army. We&#x27;re all across the country, and now we&#x27;re in foreign countries also. And they have no idea how many of us there are...We have money, many allies that are outlaw bikers that are not Hells Angels, that would probably do anything we asked them to, if something happened&quot;.

Barger and 17 of his co-defendants went on trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California at the San Francisco federal courthouse beginning on October 4, 1979. The prosecution team, representing the federal government, attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the Hells Angels of racketeering offenses related to illegal weapons and drugs. According to U.S. Attorney William Hunter, the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the Hells Angels&#x27; drug enterprise was the &quot;large‐scale manufacture and mass distribution of methamphetamine&quot;. Prosecutors claimed that the Angels accumulated $160,000 per day in street sales of the drug. Tim McKinley of the FBI stated that the case against the Hells Angels had been poorly prepared as the prosecution had taken convictions for Barger and the other Hells Angel leaders for granted. McKinley told the Canadian journalists Julian Sher and William Marsden: &quot;The problem was in the FBI we didn&#x27;t have any idea who was in the Hells Angels. I thought &#x27;this is weird&#x27;: this may explain why we&#x27;re not doing very well at the trial&quot;. The FBI had conducted no electronic surveillance of the Hells Angels and the prosecution had no corroboration of what its witnesses were testifying to at the trial.

The defense maintained that the club should not be held accountable for crimes committed by individual members. Barger himself admitted during the trial that he had used and sold narcotics in the 1960s, but asserted that his actions did not involve the Hells Angels. On July 2, 1980, following an eight-month trial in which 194 witnesses testified, a mistrial was declared when a jury failed to reach a verdict on counts against eighteen defendants. Of the remaining twelve, nine were convicted and three — including Sonny and Sharon Barger — were acquitted.

Over a two-year period starting in 1980, the Melbourne chapter of the Hells Angels led by Peter John Hill shipped three hundred liters of P2P (a chemical necessary to manufacture amphetamine) to the United States. Hill sent two cans of P2P per shipment, that provided enough P2P to make $50 million worth of amphetamine. Hill and the rest of the Melbourne charter received no share of the profits and were told that this was their contribution to helping Barger and the other Hells Angel leaders pay the legal fees related to the RICO case.

=== War against the Outlaws ===
The Hells Angels developed into a sophisticated and structured criminal organization largely as a result of Barger&#x27;s leadership. He oversaw the club&#x27;s expansion across the United States by establishing chapters in new territories, often by &quot;patching over&quot; existing biker gangs, in pursuit of controlling the drug trade nationwide. By 1978, the Hells Angels had branched out from their home state of California and had established additional U.S. chapters in Nebraska, Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Connecticut, North Carolina and South Carolina to become the largest and most organized motorcycle gang in the country. The Hells Angels&#x27; aggressive expansion brought the club into conflict with the Outlaws, the dominant biker gang in the Midwest and the South, which held similar expansionist ambitions.

The feud between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws began in April 1974 when three members of the Hells Angels&#x27; Lowell chapter were murdered in South Florida on the orders of Outlaws leader James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Nolan as retribution for an Outlaw being beaten by Hells Angels at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party in New York. During a summit of various chapter presidents held in Rochester in November 1978, the Hells Angels declared war on the Outlaws. Barger allegedly ordered Hells Angels across the country to kill any Outlaw they encounter on sight.

According to the FBI, the Hells Angels and the Outlaws were engaged in a conflict over control of the methamphetamine trade in the United States and Canada. Authorities accused the Angels of dominating the production of the drug in the U.S. Barger addressed such allegations by saying: &quot;I&#x27;m sure there are some individual Angels who&#x27;ve sold methamphetamines. Just like I&#x27;m sure some cops have sold methamphetamines. I&#x27;m sure some of our members own guns, whether legal or not. And I&#x27;m sure the government makes a living off of us.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Barger and other senior Hells Angels ordered James &quot;Buddy&quot; Caronite, the president of the club&#x27;s East Coast chapters, to organize a peace conference with Outlaws leaders. The supposed peace meeting, scheduled to be held in an eastern state, was in fact an opportunity for the Hells Angels to assassinate their rivals&#x27; leadership, according to investigators. Having given his word to the Outlaws that they would be safe at the meeting, Caronite – who characterised himself as a &quot;man of honor&quot; – reportedly warned away the Outlaws when he learned of the assassination plot. The warning angered the Angels hierarchy, and Caronite was demoted from his position as a national officer.

In October 1982, Barger was part of a large group of Hells Angels from across the country who attended the murder trial of Jack &quot;Jack-O-Lantern&quot; Gentry, a member of the club&#x27;s Cleveland chapter accused of shooting Outlaws member Ralph &quot;Real Time&quot; Tanner behind the Outlaws&#x27; Toledo, Ohio clubhouse on November 30, 1980. Cleveland Hells Angel-turned-government witness Clarence Crouch testified for the prosecution that Gentry had murdered Tanner as part of an initiation process into the Hells Angels. The trial took place in Lucas County circuit court in Toledo, a city considered Outlaws territory. Barger and his Oakland contingent rented a house on Toledo&#x27;s Sylvania Street, and the Angels showed a significant presence in the city throughout the court case.

Wearing their &quot;colors&quot;, the bikers rode their motorcycles past the residence of assistant county prosecutor James Bates, visited the neighbors of jurors after obtaining a list of prospective jurors in the case, and circled the courthouse in black vans with &quot;Hells Angels&quot; painted on the side. A female juror was excused from duty after her son was threatened by a group of Hells Angels at a downtown Toledo bar that he would have &quot;lots of problems&quot; if his mother did not &quot;vote the right way&quot;. When Gentry was acquitted after a four-day trial, Barger sent invitations to the jurors to attend a party he threw for Gentry at a local Sheraton Hotel. He denied that jurors were intimidated by the Hells Angels&#x27; presence at the trial, saying: &quot;The only ones that are intimidated are the ones the feds tell to be&quot;.

In 1983, Barger was diagnosed with throat cancer and temporarily handed control of the club over to his second-in-command, Michael &quot;Irish&quot; O&#x27;Farrell, while he received and recovered from treatment.

=== Operation Cacus ===
Anthony &quot;Taterhead&quot; Tait, the sergeant-at-arms of the Hells Angels chapter in Anchorage, Alaska, volunteered to become a paid informant for the FBI in 1984, commencing a three-year nationwide Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation known as Operation Cacus. Traveling the country at government expense, Tait made documented purchases of firearms, explosives, and drugs from various Hells Angels chapters. He also covertly recorded club meetings by wearing a wire. During one such meeting, Barger admiringly told Tait that he represented the &quot;Hells Angel of the &#x27;90s&quot; – clean-cut, articulate, and capable of carrying out club business. Barger promoted Tait to sergeant-at-arms of all Hells Angels chapters on the West Coast, allowing the informant to reach a senior position in the club&#x27;s hierarchy.

In April 1986, Barger had a member of the Oakland chapter, Terry Dalton, expelled for stealing. On May 14, 1986, Barger had a photograph of Dalton issued to all Hells Angels chapters along a with note saying that Dalton was &quot;fucking up&quot; by socializing with the Hells Angels, especially with the members of the Vallejo chapter who were close to Dalton. In July 1986, Barger, who was angry that the Vallejo chapter were still friends with Dalton, invited them to the Oakland clubhouse where he had them all beaten. Tait, who was present during the beatings, wrote: &quot;Several people gathered [Vallejo chapter president] Derrick Kualapi and took turns beating him&quot;. Tait described Barger as the man in charge of the beatings.

On August 12, 1986, John Cleave &quot;J.C.&quot; Webb, a member of the Anchorage chapter, was shot and killed after an argument with two Outlaws, Leonard Wayne &quot;Cool Ray&quot; Mullen and Marshall Howell Duncan, outside a biker bar on Dixie Highway in Jefferson County, Kentucky, prompting Barger to say that it was &quot;time to start killing Outlaws again&quot;. The Hells Angels began plotting to avenge Webb&#x27;s killing by attacking members of the Outlaws chapter in Louisville, and Barger appointed Anthony Tait to lead the campaign. Barger sent a stolen copy of a government document prepared by the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), which contained the identities and personal data of Outlaws members and associates, via express mail to Webb&#x27;s sister in Louisville, Debbie Mansfield, who then turned it over to Hells Angels members from Anchorage. He also displayed another copy of the EPIC manual and explained how to use it to fellow Hells Angels at an Oakland chapter meeting on August 17, 1986. When another chapter member, Elliott &quot;Cisco&quot; Valderrama, suggested calling the Outlaws to inquire whether Webb&#x27;s killing was an isolated incident, Barger replied: &quot;Call them collect.&quot; He lent the EPIC manual to Tait for photocopying after Anchorage chapter president Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Hubert, who also expressed retaliatory sentiment after Webb&#x27;s killing, instructed Tait to acquire a copy of the manual in September 1986.

When Tait informed Barger in a phone conversation that the FBI was investigating the package he had mailed to Webb&#x27;s sister, Barger proposed the alibi that the package contained sympathy cards. Barger also circulated a photograph of the two Outlaws who killed Webb, firstly at an Oakland chapter meeting on November 30, 1986, and again at a summit of West Coast chapter officers on January 3, 1987. He and Tait discussed retaliation against the Outlaws on several occasions, and Tait encouraged Barger to travel to Alaska to provide guidance to the Anchorage Hells Angels chapter on retributive action. During a visit to Barger&#x27;s house on January 17, 1987, Tait asked for advice about killing Outlaws, with Barger telling him: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter which one. You&#x27;re not going to get the guys that did it [killed Webb]...You can snipe one of them...Don&#x27;t get caught&quot;.

On September 18, 1987, two members, Kenneth &quot;Kenny&quot; Yates and Andrew Shission, and a &quot;prospect&quot;, John Ray Bonds, of the Cleveland chapter were ambushed by Outlaws when they stopped in Joliet, Illinois to repair a defective motorcycle while en route to an East Coast officers meeting in Minneapolis. The three Hells Angels had their patches stolen, and chapter president Yates was shot in the foot. The incident gave rise to a second retaliation plot against the Outlaws in the Midwest headed by the Cleveland chapter. Shortly afterwards, Tait told Barger that he had been to Chicago and Milwaukee to carry out reconnaissance on Outlaws clubhouses there and that he would require an alibi if he was to carry out an attack, to which Barger responded: &quot;That would be no problem.&quot; On October 18, 1987, Tait informed Barger of a fictitious plot to bomb the Outlaws&#x27; Chicago headquarters, which he purported would likely kill five or six people, and Barger replied: &quot;That&#x27;ll be really nice after that Joliet thing&quot;. When Tait mentioned: &quot;There might be innocent people there&quot;, Barger answered: &quot;That&#x27;s what they get for hanging around with guys like that&quot;. Barger then made plans to provide an alibi for Tait. Between October 20 and 23, 1987, Michael O&#x27;Farrell periodically stayed in a Hyatt hotel room booked by Tait and drove Tait&#x27;s rental car. Tait called Barger on November 9, 1987, and reported that he had accomplished his mission.

Operation Cacus concluded on November 10, 1987, when 38 Hells Angels members and associates in Alaska, California, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina were arrested on various narcotics, weapons, explosives, and conspiracy charges. Barger was among thirteen people taken into custody in the Bay Area, where over 400 FBI, ATF, and California State Police personnel carried out 26 raids on homes and other properties, seizing more than 100 weapons, approximately $1 million in cash and drugs, and three methamphetamine laboratories. Two EPIC manuals and a homemade explosive device were discovered in Barger&#x27;s home by federal agents. Tim McKinley of the FBI gave orders to the FBI agents who arrested Barger to place his handcuffed hands behind his back, which the agents ignored and placed his hands in front. McKinley joked to Sher and Marsden: &quot;Good help is so hard to get&quot;. As Barger was being marched into the FBI&#x27;s San Francisco office on November 10, 1987, Ted Baltas of the ATF approached Barger to take custody of him, Barger kicked him in the right knee and assaulted him. When McKinley came to Baltas&#x27;s aid, he in turn assaulted him. Barger&#x27;s last words to McKinley, a man he had hated, were: &quot;Fuck you, McKinley, you&#x27;re an asshole!&quot; McKinley stated the trial was a desperate time for Barger as he stated: &quot;When he gets scared and under pressure, he reverts to type. Cornered, trapped, he lashes out&quot;.

A Hyatt hotel room key and a handwritten note — deemed to have been written by Barger after evaluation by a handwriting expert — listing Anthony Tait&#x27;s hotel room number and rental car license plate number were also found at Michael O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s residence. While most of the Hells Angels arrested in Northern California were charged with drug offenses, Barger and O&#x27;Farrell were accused of conspiring to violate federal firearms and explosives laws. U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese stated that Barger&#x27;s arrest had averted five murders. Barger was formally indicted on December 15, 1987, along with twenty others.

=== Conspiracy trial and imprisonment ===
Barger and nine other Hells Angels from California and Alaska were extradited to Kentucky to stand trial for conspiring to transport firearms and explosives across state lines. The ten defendants went on trial at Louisville federal court beginning in July 1988, accused of plotting to bomb Outlaws clubhouses in the Portland neighborhood of Louisville and elsewhere, in retaliation for the killing of John Cleave Webb. Around a hundred Hells Angels wearing full &quot;colors&quot; attended the trial, as did the country singer Johnny Paycheck, a friend of Barger. The U.S. Marshals Service provided security, and the assistant U.S. attorneys assigned to the case were deputized by the Marshals, allowing them to carry guns inside the courthouse.

The prosecution asserted that the Hells Angels were a highly organized criminal organization ruled by a &quot;code of silence&quot; involved in drug trafficking, shootings and bombings. Anthony Tait, the government&#x27;s key witness in the case, was housed in a safehouse in the Louisville suburb of Prospect during the trial, where he was guarded by an FBI SWAT team. Barger was represented by defense attorney Stephen Miller, and Barger&#x27;s wife worked on the defense team as a paralegal. The defense endeavored to expose the government&#x27;s &quot;outrageous&quot; investigative conduct and discredit Tait, whom the government acknowledged was paid $300,000 in salary and expenses for the information he provided. Tait&#x27;s estranged wife, Brenda Lee Fowler, gave evidence for the defense, calling her husband a &quot;liar, a scum and a cheater&quot; and alleging that he dealt drugs. Leonard Mullen, the Outlaws member convicted of killing Webb, testified that he shot Webb over a personal feud and that there was no war between the Outlaws and the Angels. He also attested that the FBI had asked him to fake his own death in order to further their investigation against the Hells Angels, to which he refused. The defendants shook hands with Mullen and thanked him for his testimony.

Under a special arrangement approved by U.S. District Judge Edward H. Johnstone, defense attorneys subpoenaed each of the codefendants as witnesses, entitling them to &quot;per diem&quot; witness fees. The total cost of the case was estimated at $1 million. Barger reportedly celebrated his 50th birthday in the midst of the trial by partying and smoking marijuana at the home of Thomas Clay, Michael O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s lawyer, in Goshen, Kentucky.

Following a three-month-trial, the longest ever in the history of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Barger and O&#x27;Farrell were convicted on October 28, 1988, on the felony charge of conspiracy to transport and receive explosives in interstate commerce with intent to kill and damage buildings. Barger and three other defendants were also convicted on the misdemeanor charge of knowingly converting a copy of a government document, while five others were acquitted of all charges. He stated following his conviction: &quot;I think we won very handily in there. It was just too bad that Irish [O’Farrell] and I were convicted, but we will probably win an appeal. I think it was a devastating blow to the government, and I couldn’t be happier with the verdict except if I had been found innocent myself.&quot;

On April 21, 1989, Barger was sentenced to 57 months&#x27; imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Institution, Phoenix, Arizona and fined $6,000. He took up running for exercise in prison, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m slow but I can go on forever&quot;. While imprisoned, Barger received dozens of requests for interviews every month but continuously turned them down as he was collaborating with a screenwriter at the time to have his life story turned into a film and was unwilling to compromise the commercial viability of the project. At Christmas 1989, he sent one of the prosecutors in the case, assistant U.S. attorney Cleve Gambill, a card from prison, showing him posing on a towel as if he were on the beach, with the message: &quot;Nice weather. Wish you were here.&quot; As inmate 82740–011, he came to be fond of Arizona as later wrote: &quot;I dig the desert; it&#x27;s the new California. It&#x27;s wide and free&quot;.

Barger appealed his convictions, contending that the government&#x27;s investigative conduct had deprived him of his Fifth Amendment right to due process, that he had been incited to commit crimes by Anthony Tait and the government, and that the district court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act guidelines. He said of the government&#x27;s case against him: &quot;There never was a crime thought up by the Hells Angels. It was thought up by the FBI. It was paid for by the FBI. And I went to jail for it. That&#x27;s the way it goes.&quot;

On January 23, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld Barger&#x27;s convictions, stating that granting him amnesty &quot;would greatly intrude into the law enforcement functions of the executive branches of federal and state governments&quot;. The Appeals Court agreed with the government&#x27;s position that its conduct was necessary due to the Hells Angels&#x27; violent history, and rejected Barger&#x27;s argument that the government had committed entrapment because it deemed the conspiracy to have been originated by the Hells Angels themselves. Furthermore, the Appeals Court ruled that the district court did not act in error to sentence Barger under the federal guidelines.

=== Release from prison ===
Barger was released from prison on November 6, 1992, after serving three-and-a-half years of a four-year sentence. On the day of his release, Barger took a flight to Oakland International Airport and attended a homecoming party at the Mountain House, a bar at Altamont Pass in Livermore, at which Johnny Paycheck performed. To celebrate the end of his parole, he held another private party in Livermore on November 6, 1994, which was attended by approximately 700 guests, including the politicians Gary Condit and Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Colorado state senator Nighthorse Campbell had allegedly tried to use his influence to have Barger released from prison earlier.

The conflict between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws saw a resurgence following Barger&#x27;s release from prison as a result of his longstanding rivalry with Outlaws president Harry &quot;Taco&quot; Bowman. Philip Reich of the Detroit Police Department motorcycle gang unit described the feud as &quot;an ongoing thing over who had the better club&quot;, saying: &quot;It was like the Hatfields and McCoys. They hated each other.&quot; In an attempt to quell the increasing tensions between the clubs, Ventura Hells Angels chapter president George &quot;Gus&quot; Christie twice attended peace talks with Bowman in Florida, firstly in December 1992 and again in May 1993. The proposed peace treaty ultimately broke down, however, when Bowman suddenly withdrew from the negotiations on the advice of one of his lieutenants, Kevin &quot;Spike&quot; O&#x27;Neill, who thought agreeing to a ceasefire would make the Outlaws appear weak. In August 1993, in Paris, leaders of the Hells Angels and the Bandidos signed the &quot;Pact of Paris&quot; that divided up much of Europe between the two clubs.

Hostilities between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws increased significantly when the Angels recruited the Hell&#x27;s Henchmen, a biker gang operating in the Outlaws&#x27; territory of Illinois and Indiana. The Hell&#x27;s Henchmen resisted the Outlaws&#x27; attempts to forcibly amalgamate the gang and began &quot;prospecting&quot; for the Hells Angels instead in 1993 before &quot;patching over&quot; to become the Angels&#x27; chapters in Chicago, Rockford and South Bend in 1994. The Hells Angels&#x27; expansion into Illinois and Indiana, and the Outlaws&#x27; attempts to prevent the Angels from infiltrating their territory, resulted in a number of shootings and bombings in the Midwest.

At the same time, Barger handled the outbreak of the Great Nordic Biker War in Scandinavia. In early 1994, Barger summoned Thomas Möller, the president of the Hells Angels Malmö chapter, to remind him that the &quot;Pact of Paris&quot; was a non-aggression pact. A summit was held between the leaders of the Hells Angels Oakland chapter and the Bandidos Houston chapter where it was agreed that the Bandidos would abide by the &quot;Pact of Paris&quot;, which had assigned Sweden to the Hells Angels. The attempts to avert a biker war in Scandinavia failed largely because the Danish Bandido leader Jim Tinndahn kept trying to expand the Bandidos into Sweden contrary to the &quot;Pact of Paris&quot;, and the American leaders of the Bandidos were unable to control Tinndahn.

Harry Bowman allegedly placed a $100,000 bounty on Barger&#x27;s life. In early 1995, Bowman sent a team of Outlaws members to California to carry out surveillance ahead of the assassination of either Barger or George Christie. The plot was thwarted when three members of an Outlaws hit squad were arrested in Ventura after federal agents intercepted details of a planned assassination of Christie on a wiretap. The turf war between the Outlaws and the Hells Angels ended in the spring of 1995 due to Outlaws leaders&#x27; concerns about heightened surveillance on the club by federal authorities which resulted from the biker violence in the Midwest.

In 1997, the government of Denmark contemplated banning all outlaw biker clubs in response to the Great Nordic Biker War. To forestall this possibility, Barger attended the peace talks in Seattle representing the Hells Angels along with Thomas Möller, who was in charge of all the Hells Angels in Europe. The Bandidos were represented by their international vice president George Wegers, Charles &quot;Jaws&quot; Johnson of their Houston chapter and Jim Tinndahn of the Helsingborg chapter. The meetings ended with the American leaders imposing a truce on their Scandinavian chapters as neither the Bandidos nor the Hells Angels wanted to see a biker ban. The Canadian journalist Yves Lavigne wrote that Barger&#x27;s ability to impose a truce on the Scandinavian branches of the Hells Angels showed that his power over all of the Hells Angels chapters around the world was real, not nominal, and it was significant that he only took action in response to the possibility of a ban on outlaw biker clubs.

=== Move to Arizona ===
On October 18, 1997, the five-chapter strong Dirty Dozen biker club of Arizona &quot;patched over&quot; to become Hells Angels chapters. Barger was keen to establish Hells Angel chapters in Arizona and courted the Dirty Dozen (which despite its name number had 120 members) for five years prior to the &quot;patch-over&quot;. Barger cut the period of time serving as &quot;prospects&quot; for the Hells Angels by half. The Dirty Dozen were described by ATF agent Joe Slatalla as the &quot;largest and most violent gang in the state&quot;. The Dirty Dozen had beaten off attempts by the Mongols, the Vagos and the Devil&#x27;s Disciples to establish chapters in Arizona. Barger praised the Dirty Dozen as &quot;friends and allies&quot;. The Angels&#x27; amalgamation of the Dirty Dozen was promulgated during a meeting in Oakland. Barger transferred over from the Oakland chapter to the newly formed Cave Creek charter in October 1998. In 1999, Lavigne wrote: &quot;The Hells Angels obviously have big plans for Arizona. Sonny Barger would not pull up roots, after forty years in the Bay Area, on a whim. Talks of his retirement are premature. His move to Arizona will allow Hells Angels Ventura chapter president George &quot;Gus&quot; Christie to take over the political reins of the gang, but Barger will help legitimize the gang in the business world from the dry desert state. The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club is Sonny Barger&#x27;s life. He will retire only when he dies. He has nothing else to live for&quot;.

Barger&#x27;s role within the Arizona Hells Angels was reportedly an advisory position, as he did not hold officer status and he rarely attended rallies or public events. He founded a motorcycle repair company in Arizona named the Big Red Machine, a reference to a popular nickname for the Hells Angels. Barger was later a member of the Yavapai County chapter. Sher and Marsden wrote that by 2002, Barger was a &quot;figurehead, relinquishing day-to-day decisions to many of his underlings&quot;.

In 1998, peace talks were opened to end the long-standing biker war with the Outlaws, which was largely because the conflict was bringing down too much police pressure on both clubs. Mel Chancey, the president of the Hells Angels Chicago chapter who served as their lead negotiator, met with Barger in the spring of 1998 to discuss the negotiating terms. The talks began on July 18, 1998, in the Copacabana strip club in the Illinois town of Alsip with Edward &quot;Shock&quot; Anastas, the president of the Outlaws Milwaukee chapter, serving as their lead negotiator. Under the terms that Chancey and Anastas struck, the &quot;status quo&quot; was preserved as the Hells Angels recognized Chicago as within the territory of the Outlaws in exchange for being allowed to keep their chapters in the Chicago suburbs. The agreement also applied to Canada with the Outlaws agreeing to provide no assistance to the Rock Machine in return for peace with the Hells Angels in the United States. Barger attended the last negotiating session with the Outlaws between January 23 and 25, 1999 in Indianapolis, where in a joint press conference with Anastas it was warned that any Outlaw or Hells Angel who violated the peace agreement &quot;would be dealt with&quot;.

In 2000, Barger became a bestselling author with his autobiography, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club&quot;, co-written with Keith and Kent Zimmerman. In his autobiography, he divided the history of the Hells Angels into four eras, namely the First Era (1950s and 1960s) characterized by drug use and sex, the Second Era (1970s) characterized by organized crime, the Third Era (1980s) which he depicts as a period of persecution by the U.S. government, and the Fourth Era (1990s), which he characterized as a return to the original values of the club in the 1950s and 1960s. He subsequently wrote several biker-related novels. Barger&#x27;s 21st century books represented a change of image as Sher and Marsden noted that his earlier writings in the 20th century had &quot;gloried in self-congratulatory tales of rapes and murders&quot; while his later books presented himself as a more family friendly character. A reviewer in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on April 21, 2002, called Barger the writer of &quot;romantic tales of hell and heck raising&quot;. In later years, Barger worked to promote motorcycle safety: he co-authored a book on the subject with Darwin Holmstrom (the author of &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to Motorcycles&quot; (1998)) titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride: Sonny Barger&#x27;s Guide to Motorcycling&quot; (2010). 
In August 2000, Barger visited the United Kingdom to promote his book despite advice from the police for the Home Office to deny him a travel visa under the grounds that he had a criminal record. Barger was allowed entry under the grounds he was no longer a threat to public order. He drew large crowds for his British book signing tour. The media reaction was largely favorable. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called him &quot;a legend&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; of London wrote that Barger was &quot;affable, big-hearted, warm&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that Barger was an &quot;American legend&quot;.

Barger was present at the Hellraiser Ball, a tattoo and motorcycle trade exposition in Plainview, New York, sponsored by the Long Island chapter of the Hells Angels which was ambushed by dozens of members of the rival Pagans motorcycle gang on February 23, 2002, resulting in one biker being killed and at least ten injured. A Hells Angels member was charged with second-degree murder and seventy-three Pagan members were indicted on federal racketeering charges in the aftermath of the incident. Increasing tensions between the Hells Angels and other motorcycle clubs led to Barger organizing a peace conference scheduled to be held in the Arizona desert, following the April 2002 Laughlin River Run motorcycle rally in Laughlin, Nevada. The meeting was canceled as a result of the River Run riot, a confrontation between members of the Hells Angels and the Mongols at the rally which ended with three deaths. About the Laughlin River Run riot, which put the Hells Angels and the Mongols on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Barger stated: &quot;Publicity has always been good for the Angels&quot;.

On July 14, 2002, Barger called the police to say that he had beaten his wife, Beth Noel Barger, so badly that she is &quot;paralyzed and cannot move&quot;. Barger stated he and his wife were fighting over a &quot;slut&quot; as Beth called his mistress. Barger in his 911 call said: &quot;She tried to pull a gun on me and I kicked her and she says she can&#x27;t move&quot;. Barger then changed his story when the police arrived and said that his wife was merely going for a gun hidden in their car when he kicked her. Beth Noel Barger stated that Barger had attacked her while she was sitting in a patio chair and denied going for a gun. A doctor&#x27;s report revealed that Beth had suffered a broken rib, a broken back and a lacerated spleen. Beth also stated &quot;Sonny had beaten her before, but she never reported it&quot;. On March 6, 2003, Beth Noel Barger called the police to accuse Barger of beating her up along with her 13-year-old daughter, Sarah, by a previous marriage. One of the sheriff&#x27;s deputies in his notes of the incident wrote: &quot;Sonny Barger admitted to me that he did physically grab his wife by the arms and possibly by the throat&quot;. While Noel was being treated for her injuries at the hospital that night, she told the FBI agent Stephen Smith that Barger had a STAR 9mm semi-automatic handgun at his ranch, which would be a violation of Arizona law, which forbade felons from owning guns. Noel also claimed to have been paid $1,000 to become a &quot;confidential informant&quot; for the FBI, but gave conflicting and confusing statements to the FBI. A gun matching the description provided by Noel was found on the Barger ranch, but it remain unclear who was the owner of the gun. On March 11, 2003, a hearing was held to decide if there was enough evidence to go to trial. However, there was no evidence beyond the statements of Noel that the gun belonged to Barger. Barger&#x27;s lawyer, Brian Russo, during his cross-examination of the FBI agents, established the FBI had never dusted the gun for Barger&#x27;s fingerprints. When the judge asked the prosecutor if he knew the reason why the gun had never been dusted, he received the reply: &quot;I do not. Anything sounds like an excuse&quot;. The judge dismissed the case under the grounds there was &quot;no reliable and credible evidence&quot; that the gun belonged to Barger.

Jay Dobyns, an agent for the ATF, met Barger in Arizona while he was serving undercover in 2003. Dobyns told Sher and Marsden: &quot;He&#x27;s the shot caller, the deal broker. His reputation precedes him, so when people talk to him they know who they&#x27;re talking to. Without a doubt you know that he&#x27;s the Guy. He&#x27;s very personable, he&#x27;s charming. You can see how he developed this club. He&#x27;s a politician. He&#x27;s a salesman&quot;. Dobyns stated: &quot;He&#x27;s not a big guy, not a physically threatening guy. But he&#x27;s got this charismatic leadership personality that allowed him to build this club. When you talk to him, when you speak to him, he makes you feel that there is nothing going in his life except that conversation with you. He makes you feel important, like he is personally interested in you&quot;. Many of the younger Hells Angels resented Barger for the way he became a rich man by selling his books and paraphernalia. Dobyns stated that Barger was unpopular as the feeling within the Hells Angels were: &quot;All he&#x27;s concerned with is promoting himself, his books, his movies, his products&quot;. Papers filed in court after Barger&#x27;s wife, Noel Barger, filed for divorce on April 4, 2003, revealed that Barger made $330,328 in royalties from the sale of his autobiography in 2001, $340,843 in 2002, and $230,541 in 2003. Barger also received $150,000 from the Twentieth Century Fox studio which purchased the film rights for his autobiography. One police officer stated that the Hells Angel leaders in California disliked the way that Barger refused to step aside as he said: &quot;You can&#x27;t be the heir apparent if Sonny continues to keep calling the shots and running things. Sonny didn&#x27;t leave and people are still in battle with that&quot;. A number of other Hells Angel leaders such as George Christie, the powerful president of the Ventura chapter, were described by Sher and Marsden as &quot;rivals&quot; who were waiting for Barger to die.

On March 22, 2003, Daniel &quot;Hoover&quot; Seybert, the president of the Hells Angels Cave Creek chapter to which Barger belonged to, was murdered. At the time, Barger told the media: &quot;I&#x27;m just going to miss him. He put the club before anything else in his life&quot;. When Barger learned of Operation Black Biscuit, as the ATF operation against the Arizona Hells Angels had been code-named, after the arrests of July 8, 2003, he accused the police of killing Seybert as he maintained that Seybert was hostile towards Dobyns. After Seybert&#x27;s murder, Barger rarely appeared in public for several years afterwards without Louie Valdez, the sergeant-at-arms of the Cave Creek chapter, as his bodyguard.

=== Later years ===

Together with his lawyer, Friz Clapp, Barger owned and managed Sonny Barger Productions, a media firm designed to promote his image. Clapp told Sher and Marsden in 2005: &quot;When we were in Europe, he was greeted like the pope. Limos at the airports, anything we wanted. It was a great time&quot;. When Sher and Marsden in an interview asked Barger about his involvement in the Angels–Outlaws biker war, the Great Nordic Biker War and the Quebec Biker War, he replied: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anything about the biker wars. I have never been involved in one, and therefore I cannot talk about it&quot;. Marsden and Sher described Barger as a deeply dishonest man as they noted he had convicted of conspiracy to murder members of the Outlaws in 1988, which in their view counted as involvement in a biker war. Marsden and Sher described Barger as a man who wanted to promote his image as an &quot;outlaw&quot;, and was clearly uncomfortable about their questions about crimes involving the Hells Angels.

On November 30, 2010, Barger made a guest appearance as Lenny &quot;The Pimp&quot; Janowitz on the season 3 finale of the FX television series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, about a fictional outlaw motorcycle club, allegedly based on the Hells Angels. Show creator Kurt Sutter spent time with Barger and other members of Hells Angels researching for the show, and acted opposite Barger in his scene. Barger returned on November 29, 2011, in the season 4 finale, part one. Barger&#x27;s third guest appearance on &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; was during season 5, episode 10, which aired on November 13, 2012. One novel written by Barger, &quot;Dead in 5 Heartbeats&quot;, was made into an independent film in 2013, which Barger and his fourth wife, Zorana, produced and appeared in bit part roles. The film was promoted as having been rejected from the Sundance Film Festival and every other film festival it was submitted to. A biopic of Barger&#x27;s life was also in development for several years, with the director Tony Scott attached to the project at one point.

Barger left Arizona in October 2016, returning to the Oakland chapter. He remained a popular figure both in the United States and abroad. In May 2017, when Barger visited Paris to promote a French translation of his autobiography, he attracted huge crowds of fans to the Paris clubhouse of the Hells Angels for the book-signing. The Norwegian anthropologist Tereza Østbø Kuldova described Barger as a man who had turned himself into a brand, having become a global icon who symbolized a very ruggedly tough, macho definition of American masculinity, which explained the large crowds of Parisians who wanted him to autograph copies of his autobiography.

On May 3, 2018, Barger testified in the racketeering trial of former Bandidos national president Jeffrey Fay Pike and former vice president Xavier John Portillo after being called as a defense witness by lawyers for Pike. Unable to travel to the trial in San Antonio for medical reasons, Barger testified via video link from the federal courthouse in San Francisco, denying that the Hells Angels and the Bandidos were enemies. Barger&#x27;s testimony challenged earlier assertions by government witnesses who testified that Anthony Benesh, a motorcyclist who was shot dead in Austin on March 18, 2006, after attempting to establish a Hells Angels chapter in the city, was killed by Bandidos members because he had ignored the club&#x27;s warnings to not set up a HAMC chapter in Texas.

Barger kept a low profile in his final years, although his 81st birthday — the numbers 8 and 1 are used by the Hells Angels to refer to their corresponding letters of the alphabet, H and A — was celebrated in a major event hosted at the Oakland chapter clubhouse in October 2019.

== Personal life ==
Barger&#x27;s first wife Elsie Mae (née George) died on February 1, 1967, from an embolism in her bloodstream after undergoing an illegal abortion. In 1969, he began a relationship with Sharon Gruhlke, a former beauty queen from Livermore. Barger married Gruhlke while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison in 1973. The marriage ended in divorce.

In 1982, Barger was diagnosed with throat cancer after years of heavy smoking. He reportedly smoked three packs of Camel cigarettes per day for thirty years. His diagnosis and treatment took place at Fort Miley VA Hospital in San Francisco. Having stage III laryngeal cancer, he underwent a total laryngectomy with bilateral functional neck dissections. Consequently, due to his vocal cords being removed, Barger learned to vocalize using the muscles in his esophagus. He subsequently wore a full-face motorcycle helmet to protect the hole in his throat when riding. Barger later publicly advocated against smoking, saying: &quot;Want to be a rebel? Don&#x27;t smoke as the rest of the world&quot;.

In 1998, Barger moved to Arizona for health reasons, with his third wife Beth Noel (née Black) and stepdaughter Sarrah. He joined the Hells Angels&#x27; Cave Creek chapter, and operated a motorcycle repair shop. On March 7, 2003, Barger was arrested by Maricopa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputies after a reported domestic dispute with his wife and stepdaughter at their home in New River, Arizona. Noel suffered a broken rib and back, and a lacerated spleen. Barger was sentenced to an eight-day jail term for aggravated assault. He and Noel later divorced.

Barger married his fourth wife, Zorana (née Katzakian), on June 25, 2005, and remained married to her until his death in 2022. He had no biological children.

In 2010, Barger was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery in 2012. His prostate was removed and he was subsequently declared free of cancer.

== Death ==
On June 29, 2022, Barger died of liver cancer aged 83 at his home in Livermore, California. His death was announced in a Facebook post reading:

In July 2022, the Hells Angels made a request to hold a memorial service for Barger at the Oakland Coliseum in East Oakland the following month. Instead, Barger&#x27;s funeral was held at a motorsports racetrack in Stockton on September 24, 2022. An estimated 7,000 people attended, and the event was peaceful. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson spoke at the funeral. Carlson said that he had been a fan of Barger since his college years, quoted Barger as saying &quot;stay loyal, remain free, and always value honor&quot;, and added: &quot;I want to pay tribute to the man who spoke those words&quot;. Barger was laid to rest at Sacramento Valley National Cemetery in Dixon.

<text>The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, referred to as &quot;The Merck Manual&quot;,
is the world&#x27;s best-selling medical textbook, and the oldest continuously published English language medical textbook. First published in 1899, the current print edition of the book, the 20th Edition, was published in 2018. In 2014, Merck decided to move &quot;The Merck Manual&quot; to digital-only, online publication, available in both professional and consumer versions; this decision was reversed in 2017, with the publication of the 20th edition the following year. &quot;The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy&quot; is one of several medical textbooks, collectively known as &quot;The Merck Manuals&quot;, which are published by Merck Publishing, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical company Merck Co., Inc. in the United States and Canada, and MSD (as &quot;The MSD Manuals&quot;) in other countries in the world. Merck also formerly published &quot;The Merck Index&quot;, &quot;An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals.&quot;

==History and editions==
The first edition of &quot;The Merck Manual&quot; was published in 1899 by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. for physicians and pharmacists and was titled &quot;Merck&#x27;s Manual of the Materia Medica&quot;. The 192 page book which sold for US $1.00, was divided into three sections, Part I (&quot;Materia Medica&quot;) was an alphabetical listing of all known compounds thought to be of therapeutic value with uses and doses; Part II (&quot;Therapeutic Indications&quot;) was an alphabetical compendium of symptoms, signs, and diseases with a list of all known treatments; and Part III (&quot;Classification of Medicaments &quot;(sic)&quot; According to their Physiologic Actions&quot;) was a listing of therapeutic agents according to their method of action or drug classification. Many of the terms used are now considered archaic, such as abasia, astasia, errhines and rubefacients - sternutatories, and many of the agents listed are now not considered to be standard therapeutic agents but were considered useful at the time, including poisonous compounds such as mercury, lead, strychnine and arsenic. There were 108 remedies listed for indigestion (dyspepsia), including alcohol, arsenic, cocaine, gold chloride, mercury, morphine, nux vomica, opium, silver nitrate, strychnine, and &quot;Turkish baths (for malaise after dining out)&quot;. Bismuth, calcium, magnesium salts were also on the list, which are ingredients found in many modern gastrointestinal treatments available today. Arsenic was recommended for over 100 illnesses including anemia, diarrhea, hydrophobia, elephantiasis, and impotence. The formulas include &quot;aletris cordial&quot;, a &quot;uterine tonic and restorative&quot;, which contained &quot;aletris farinosa or True Unicorn combined with aromatics&quot;. The manufacturer, Rio Chemicals of St. Louis was clear to differentiate the inclusion of true unicorn rather than false unicorn in its preparation.
The earliest versions did contain drugs that are still in use today for the same purposes, for example digitalis for heart failure;, salicylates for headache rheumatism and fever, nitroglycerin for cardiac angina pectoris;, and bismuth salicylate for diarrhea

Merck also began publishing &quot;Merck&#x27;s Archives of the Materia Medica&quot;, a monthly journal consisting of papers related to drugs and uses, which was available for an annual subscription of US $1.00.
The second edition of &quot;The Merck Manual&quot; was published in 1901, was expanded to 282 pages and included new sections on poisons and antidotes, tables and conversion charts, and a detailed explanation of the metric system.

The 5th edition, published in 1923 was delayed due to paper shortages caused by World War I, and the release of the 6th edition was delayed until 1934 due to the Stock Market Crash. The editor of that edition, Dr. M. R. Dinkelspiel had overseen the growth and reorganization of the Manual to discuss specific diseases, diagnosis and treatment options, and external specialists reviewed each section. The 8th edition of the Manual was delayed by World War II until 1950. 
The 13th edition, released in 1977 was the first time the textbook was produced using magnetic tape and IBM punch cards, the previous version having been typed on a manual typewriter. The Centennial (17th) Edition published in 1999 included a separate facsimile version of the 1899 1st edition.

It is reported that both Admiral Richard E. Byrd took the book with him on his expedition to the South Pole in 1929 and Albert Schweitzer had a copy of The Merck Manual with him at his hospital mission in Africa in 1913.

The recommended doses given in Part 1 of 1901 edition of &quot;The Manual&quot; were for adults when given by mouth. It included the following dose adjustment recommendations:

==Content==
&quot;The Merck Manual&quot; is organized, like many internal medicine textbooks, into organ systems (see List of Medical Topics below) which discuss each major diseases of that system, covering diagnosis (signs, symptoms, tests), prognosis and treatment. It provides a comprehensive yet concise compendium of medical knowledge into about 3500 pages, by emphasizing practical information of use to a practicing physician. In addition to 24 sections covering medical topics, it includes a pharmacology section listing drugs by generic and brand name, a list of drug interactions and a pill identifier, a News and Commentary section, videos on procedures and examination techniques, quizzes and case histories, clinical calculators, conversion tables and other resources. The text is characterized by the combination of conciseness, completeness, and being up-to-date. It is updated continuously by an independent editorial board and over 300 peer reviewers that contribute to the textbook, which goes through an average of 10 revisions by both internal and external reviewers before publication. The internal editorial staff consists of 4 physician reviews, one executive editor and four non-medical lay editors. The latest version has been translated into 17 languages. In addition to the online version, &quot;The Merck Manual Professional Edition&quot; is also available as a mobile app in both iOS and Android platforms, produced by Unbound Medicine, Inc.

<text>Azul (, English: &quot;blue&quot;, for the stream Azul, which flows through the area) is the head city of the Azul Partido, located at the center of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina, 300 km south of Buenos Aires. It has 63,000 inhabitants as per the .

Its principal, goods-producing economic activities are agriculture and the raising of cattle for meat and leather exports. Home to a dynamic services sector, over 2,000 commercial businesses are registered in the city.

The town was founded on December 16, 1832, following Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas&#x27; orders for the construction of a fort, San Serapio Mártir del Arroyo Azul, to guard against indigenous raids. Subsequent land grants led to the development of a stable community, and in 1895, Azul was formally declared a town by provincial authorities. The local cathedral, Nuestra Señora del Rosario, was consecrated in 1906. 

The town&#x27;s cemetery portal and main slaughterhouse were both designed by architect Francisco Salamone, and contain elements of Art Deco style. Built in the late 1930s, these buildings were some of the first examples of modern architecture in rural Argentina. The town was the scene of an attack on outlying Army barracks by far-left ERP militants on January 19, 1974, the most violent assault of its kind in the country up to that point.

Azul is home to the schools of Agronomy and Law of the National University of Central Buenos Aires. The Teatro Español, founded in the city in 1897, is among the most important of the central pampas area, and in 1992, hosted the Bolshoi Ballet.

The Miguel de Cervantes Festival is held there every spring since 2007, and &quot;Casa Ronco&quot;, an antiquarian library and museum, maintains the country&#x27;s best collections relating to the noted Spanish writer. &quot;Casa Ronco&quot; is named after the collector Bartolomé Ronco. Azul was declared Argentina&#x27;s &quot;City of Cervantes&quot; by UNESCO in 2007.

<doc id="1136673" wikidata="Q42643" url="?curid=1136673" title="Points (coat color)">
<text>Points are specific areas of an animal coat that are colored differently from the main body colorations. Point coloration may be represented by a pale body color and relatively darker extremities, such as face, ears, feet, tail, and external sex organs, as seen on Siamese cats. However, colored points can be found in many mammal species and some points are lighter than the main body color.

== Temperature-dependent colorpoint ==

In many species, colorpoint patterns come from a genetic mechanism causing pigment to be produced only in cooler areas of the body, called acromelanism. This can be seen in cats, dogs (rare), fancy rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits.

== Dogs ==

Colored points in dogs are lighter than the body coat, and usually tan. Tan points include small patches above the eyes and on the cheeks, the sides of the muzzle, front of neck and chest, lower legs and insides of legs, and under the tail.

== Horses ==


When referring to horse colors, the &quot;points&quot; are the mane, tail, lower legs, and ear rims. Certain combinations of point color and body color determine most horse color names. For example, a bay horse has a reddish-brown body color with black points, and a buckskin is a yellowish horse with black points. Some horse colorations have nonblack points (cream, red or brown), such as the red dun which has red to brown points.

In a color with points (black or nonblack) the legs are dark and the color goes all the way down to the hoof, whereas in a horse color without points the color just above the hoof is lighter than its body color. Roan horses have white hairs interspersed throughout their body color, but the points are unaffected and remain black, however a horse with high white leg markings might have their points obscured.

== Livestock ==

Some breeds of sheep exhibit point coloration with a white fleece and colored head and legs, usually black. Sheep breeds with black points include: Clun Forest, Dorset Down, Hampshire Down, Norfolk Horn, Oxford Down, Shropshire, Suffolk, and Valais Blacknose. Instead of black, American Tunis sheep have a red face, and Wensleydale sheep have a blue-grey face.

In cattle, extreme color-sidedness creates a colorpoint pattern with a white body and darker ears, nose, and feet. Breeds displaying this pattern include the White Park, British White and some Irish Moiled.

Points in pigs are usually referred to in the color scheme &quot;six white points&quot; where the pig coat color is black and there is white on the four feet, the head, and the end of the tail. Pig breeds with six white points include the Berkshire pig and Poland China.

In donkeys, the term &quot;points&quot; refers to the muzzle, rings around the eyes, belly, and upper inner legs, which are usually light in color. The mane, tail, and ear rims are referred to as &quot;trim&quot; and roughly correspond to the &quot;points&quot; of horses. Most donkeys have light points. The coat colors without light points may be called &quot;no light points&quot;, &quot;dark points&quot;, or &quot;black points&quot;. Dark points are caused by a recessive allele of agouti found in Normand and Miniature donkeys. The light areas may vary in extent, with some donkeys having a dark nose but with light areas on the insides of the legs.

<doc id="1136714" wikidata="Q3544014" url="?curid=1136714" title="USS Bugara">
<text>USS &quot;Bugara&quot; (SS-331), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in commission from 1944 to 1970, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the bugara, a multicolored fish found along the coast of California.

&quot;Bugara&quot;&#x27;s World War II operations extended from 21 February to 17 August 1945, during which she completed three war patrols in the Flores Sea, Java Sea, South China Sea and Gulf of Siam. While the first two patrols proved uneventful, her third war patrol might be classified as one of the most colorful to be made during the war. This patrol in the Gulf of Siam was highlighted by a series of excellently conducted gun attacks which disposed of 57 small ships totaling 5,284 gross register tons. All except two of these vessels were boarded and their native crews put safely ashore with their personal belongings. One of the many interesting incidents of this patrol was an encounter with a Japanese ship manned by a Chinese crew being attacked by Malay pirates. &quot;Bugara&quot; rescued the Chinese, sank the Japanese ship, and then disposed of the pirates.

&quot;Bugara&quot; later served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Bugara&quot; was laid down on 21 October 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 2 July 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Anna A. Perry, wife of Captain Lyman S. Perry, and commissioned on 15 November 1944 with Commander Arnold F. Schade — a veteran of eight war patrols and recipient of the Navy Cross and the Silver Star — in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====November 1944–February 1945====
&quot;Bugara&quot; fitted out for service, conducted her shakedown, then departed on 25 December 1944 bound for the Panama Canal Zone. She conducted five days of additional training in the Panama Canal Zone, then pushed on for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where Schade put his crew through two more weeks of intensive training.

====First war patrol====

&quot;Bugara&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 21 February 1945 to begin her first war patrol and proceeded directly to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, meeting her escort, the motor minesweeper , on 5 March 1945 before reaching Saipan. On 8 March 1945, she got underway from Saipan in company with the submarines and and an escort, the submarine chaser . One day out of port, on 9 March 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot;’s cook sustained a severe head laceration when the storeroom hatch fell on him, but &quot;Bugara&quot;′s pharmacist&#x27;s mate was able to sew up the cut, and &quot;Bugara&quot; continued her voyage to her patrol area in the Luzon Strait. On 25 March 1945 she left the Luzon Strait and proceeded to a new patrol area in the South China Sea between Hainan Island and Formosa.

On 27 March 1945, &quot;Buugara&quot;′s lookouts spotted a ship bearing 118° north at a range of . She closed to attack but abruptly broke it off upon identifying the markings as those of a Japanese hospital ship. On 4 April 1945, she concluded her patrol in the Hainan and Taiwan area not having encountered any other Japanese air or surface contacts and proceeded to her next patrol area in the Java Sea, north of Soemba, which she reached on 11 April 1945. At 08:15 on 18 April she exchanged recognition signals with the submarine and that same day at 19:30 with the submarine . On 21 April 1945 she met her escort and proceeded to Fremantle, Australia, where she ended her patrol and began a regular refit, which included the installation of a second /25-caliber gun.

With Japanese shipping becoming scarce in the last months of World War II, &quot;Bugara&quot; made contact with only five ships during her entire 59-day patrol, during which she had spent 35 days in her patrol areas. Four of the vessels proved to be Japanese hospital ships, immune from attack, and the fifth an unidentified submarine &quot;Bugara&quot; first had detected by screw noises, but which turned out to be an unidentified Allied submarine.

====Second war patrol====
On 16 May 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; set out on her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area in the South China Sea off the South China coast. Most of her time was spent on life guard stations looking for downed Allied airmen. She ended her patrol with her arrival on 20 June 1945 at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, where she underwent a refit alongside the submarine tender .

====Third war patrol====
=====Convoy action=====
&quot;Bugara&quot; stood out of Subic Bay on 16 July 1945 for her third war patrol, operating as part of a coordinated attack group under the overall command of the commanding officer of the submarine , Commander Harry B. Dodge. She rendezvoused with &quot;Brill&quot; on 19 July 1945, and Dodge ordered her to conduct a retiring search to her northward position in the attack group.

At 15:40 on 19 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts sighted a mast on the horizon and closed with it at full speed but lost the contact. However, 20 minutes later, her lookouts again sighted masts, this time of ships making up a convoy, as well as what &quot;Bugara&quot; identified as a Japanese periscope at a range of . Schade ordered &quot;Bugara&quot; to dive in order to reverse course and then surface at flank speed. The supposed Japanese periscope turned out to be that of &quot;Brill&quot;, also chasing the convoy. Schade tried to ascertain &quot;Brill&quot;′s attack position so that the two submarines could coordinate their attack, but could not get &quot;Brill&quot; to answer &quot;Bugara&quot;′s challenge, so the submarines began separate approaches to the convoy without a set plan of attack. At 22:05, &quot;Bugara&quot; picked up several contacts on radar at a range of and went ahead at full speed at . At nearly the same time, &quot;Bugara&quot; received information from Dodge that the submarines and were on her port flank, with &quot;Brill&quot; and &quot;Bugara&quot; on the starboard. Dodge announced that &quot;Brill&quot; was going in to attack, and Schade radioed back that &quot;Bugara&quot; would follow &quot;Brill&quot; in.

&quot;Bugara&quot; fired nine torpedoes into the Japanese convoy, including two at a small engines-aft tanker at a range of , two at a second small engines-aft tanker at a range of , two at a small cargo ship (known to the Americans as a &quot;sea truck&quot;) at a range of , one at an escorting patrol craft at a range of , and two at a large trawler (which &quot;Bugara&quot; assumed was an escort), at a range of . &quot;Brill&quot; also attacked the convoy, but none of &quot;Bugara&quot;′s or &quot;Brill&quot;′s torpedoes hit. Both Schade and Dodge concluded that their torpedoes ran normally but had passed underneath their targets. The Japanese did not counterattack the submarines.

=====20 July=====
At 14:45 on 20 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts sighted a junk and closed to get alongside. After taking off the junk&#x27;s crew of six natives, &quot;Bugara&quot; sent a boarding party aboard the junk for inspection. The boarding party found that the junk was carrying bags of sugar from Singapore to Bangkok, Thailand, both Japanese-controlled ports. The junk′s crew claimed that the junk&#x27;s cargo was destined for China, not the Japanese. Although unconvinced, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew kept all of the junk crew&#x27;s papers for later analysis by intelligence personnel and let them go after 90 minutes alongside the junk.

At 16:30 on 20 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded another large junk which had departed Bangkok with a cargo hold full of bagged rice. The junk&#x27;s crew claimed the cargo was destined for China, not the Japanese, and &quot;Bugara&quot; confiscated the junk&#x27;s logbook and released the crew. At 20:30, &quot;Bugara&quot; inspected a third junk, whose crew told a similar story of transporting the vessel&#x27;s cargo of rice to China and not to Japanese troops. Schade subsequently sent a message to Commander, Task Force 71, requesting approval his of actions of letting supplies go through.

=====23–24 July=====
On 23 July 1945, after diving to avoid an Imperial Japanese Navy Kawanishi H8K Type 2 (Allied reporting name &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boat headed out from the beach off the coast of Lem Chong Pra, Schade ordered a commando party ashore heavily armed with demolition equipment. After six hours, &quot;Bugara&quot; picked up the commandos at 04:00 on 24 July 1945. Highly embarrassed, they reported that the jungle was so thick they had not been able get off the beach.

At 13:35 on 24 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; examined a Singapore-bound schooner carrying a 10-ton military cargo of airplane wheels and tires, 15 cases of airplane parts, and metal stock and sugar. She removed the schooner&#x27;s crew and sank the vessel with gunfire. At 14:25, she stopped the 120-gross register ton Japanese junk &quot;Hiap Seng Maru&quot;, which was carrying a cargo of sugar and sewing machines to Singapore. After boarding and examining &quot;Hiap Seng Maru&quot;, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her with gunfire. With the schooner&#x27;s and &quot;Hiap Seng Maru&quot;′s crews and their boats on her deck, &quot;Bugara&quot; moved to a point off shore, gave the crew members bread, and released them.

=====25 July=====
On 25 July at 14:05, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew boarded a 75-gross register ton schooner bound for Singapore with a cargo of 50 tons of rice and sank her with gunfire after taking off her crew. At 15:35, &quot;Bugara&quot; halted a 25-gross register ton junk sailing from Singapore carrying a Japanese cargo of sugar and matches . Although most of &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew thought the junk&#x27;s crew were Japanese, their nationality could not be proven, so &quot;Bugara&quot; released them and sank their ship with gunfire. At 16:24, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s raiding party boarded an empty 20-gross register ton coastal cargo ship left abandoned by her Japanese crew, and &quot;Bugara&quot; left it, planning to return and sink it later.

At 16:50, &quot;Bugara&quot; halted and boarded her ninth contact in just a day, a brand-new 51-gross register ton schooner sailing from Singapore with a cargo of sugar and coffee. The schooner&#x27;s crew abandoned ship and &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her with gunfire, not bothering to capture her crew. &quot;Bugara&quot; made her next contact at 17:30 when her raiding party boarded the 50-gross register ton junk &quot;Kian Huat&quot;, which was carrying sugar and coffee from Singapore to Champon, Thailand. &quot;Kian Huat&quot;′s Japanese crew of four abandoned ship, their later fate unknown, and &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her with gunfire. One hour later, the Japanese crew of the 125-gross register ton schooner &quot;Joo Lee Maru&quot;, flying the Japanese Rising Sun flag and loaded with a cargo of sugar and miscellaneous stores from Singapore, abandoned ship when &quot;Bugara&quot; stopped them, and &quot;Bugara&quot; sank the schooner with gunfire. &quot;Bugara&quot; then returned to the abandoned coastal cargo ship she had boarded earlier and destroyed it with gunfire.

=====26 July=====
On 26 July 1945, lookouts on board &quot;Bugara&quot; sighted three terengganus (junk-rigged schooners) at 03:00, and boarded them all. Two were native vessels from Japanese-occupied British Malaya and carrying cargo of no military value, so &quot;Bugara&quot; let them go. The other was a 20-gross register ton vessel under Japanese registry, and &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew noting that the Malayan native crews of the other two terengganus &quot;seemed almost happy to get rid of this one.” At 08:45 that morning, &quot;Bugara&quot; searched the 144-gross register ton junk &quot;Chit Ming Ho Maru&quot;, which was bound for Singapore with a cargo of 75 tons of rice, and sank her with gunfire, letting her crew go. At 15:50, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded a brand-new 50-gross register ton &quot;sea truck&quot; loaded with drums of aviation gasoline, then set her ablaze with two shell hits, destroying her; &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew last saw the &quot;sea truck′s&quot; Japanese crew jumping overboard and swimming quickly away from her.

&quot;Bugara&quot; next sank a 75-gross register ton schooner loaded with 50 tons of rice and headed for Singapore. At 17:40, she moved into waters as shallow as to stop and sink a 150-gross register ton schooner loaded with 10 cases of cholera antiserum), other medical supplies, scrap iron, and rice. The next small craft &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew boarded was an empty 50-gross register ton schooner and, unable to determine her destination, Schade let her pass. At 20:30, &quot;Bugara&quot; went alongside the two Malayan native terengganus she had passed earlier in the day and, according to Schade, “got a big cheer.”

=====27 July=====
On 27 July 1945 at 08:10, &quot;Bugara&quot; came alongside a native Thai lugger whose “very friendly&quot; crew tried to give &quot;Bugara&quot; their cargo of live chickens&quot; and urged &quot;Bugara&quot; to &quot;go get some Nippon.&quot; At 09:50, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded an empty 300-gross register ton schooner manned by a native crew that denied any Japanese connections. Although &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew doubted the Japanese would not be using such a large vessel, they let the schooner go. One hour later, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s raiding party boarded a 20-ton schooner flying the Japanese flag and carrying a load of miscellaneous gear, removed her crew, and sank her with gunfire. The crew was friendly, expressed a desire to remain with &quot;Bugara&quot; and repeatedly said that the Japanese had lost the war and they were glad they would no longer have to work for the Japanese. &quot;Bugara&quot;′s galley fed them, and one received medical treatment for an unlisted ailment.

At 13:40, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts spotted a Japanese Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boat, so &quot;Bugara&quot; quickly backed full, put the natives over the side in their lifeboat, then went ahead full and dived to . Schade reported that he last saw the natives headed for shore in their boat, apparently safe. The Japanese flying boat gave no indication that it had spotted either &quot;Bugara&quot; or the natives headed to shore and departed the area. Only 15 minutes later, &quot;Bugara&quot; surfaced to chase a loaded 75-gross register ton schooner, and nearly an hour later, at 14:45, she was only from the schooner at gun action stations when the flying boat reappeared, so &quot;Bugara&quot; dived once more to . At 15:05, after the flying boat departed, &quot;Bugara&quot; surfaced alongside the schooner, which was sailing from Singapore loaded with 50 tons of sugar and so full that her decks were almost awash. After removing the crew, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank the schooner by gunfire.

At 20:50, &quot;Bugara&quot; spotted a mast at a range of about with darkness falling quickly on a moonless night. &quot;Bugara&quot; closed at full speed and at a range of identified her quarry as a probable schooner. &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew went to gun action stations. Coming alongside, &quot;Bugara&quot; found the vessel to be a 200-gross register ton schooner loaded with at least 150 tons of rice bound for Singapore. &quot;Bugara&quot; removed the schooner′s crew before sinking her with gunfire.

=====28 July=====
On 28 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; began the day at 09:45 boarding a 50-gross register ton coastal cargo ship loaded with rice and bound for Singapore. The crew was ordered off before &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners made short work of the ship and sank her. At 10:44, &quot;Bugara&quot; made her 25th contact of her war patrol, when a second 50-ton coastal cargo ship made for the edge of a minefield with &quot;Bugara&quot; in pursuit. While &quot;Bugara&quot; was alongside the vessel, an Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi F1M Type 0 (Allied reporting name &quot;Pete&quot;) observation floatplane approached from shore. With the crew of the cargo ship having abandoned ship and clear of their vessel, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners opened fire and sank the small vessel just as the floatplane turned around and headed back toward shore. Three hours later, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts spotted a 300-gross register ton three-masted schooner close to shore. Schade decided sinking the large schooner was worth the risk of entering shallow water near shore, and ordered &quot;Bugara&quot; in at flank speed. The schooner′s Japanese crew apparently had abandoned ship early, so Schade ordered &quot;Bugara&quot; to open gunfire on the schooner without bothering to first board her and ascertain her cargo. The schooner sank in of water with all three of her masts sticking straight out of the water. &quot;Bugara&quot; then retired to deeper water at high speed.

At 16:35, a boarding party from &quot;Bugara&quot; descended upon the 75-gross register ton schooner &quot;Kiat Ann&quot;. Papers found on board listed a cargo of sugar from Singapore to Bangkok, but an adamant crew claimed the cargo was rice, bound for Singapore. Although &quot;Kiat Ann&quot; was registered to the Japanese and &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew was almost certain that four members of her crew were Japanese, &quot;Bugara&quot; removed and released the entire crew, then sank &quot;Kiat Ann&quot; with gunfire.

At 21:25, &quot;Bugara&quot; went alongside a Chusan-type junk of 25 gross register tons. The seven-man crew, all Canton Chinese, seemed friendly, but freely admitted they had just returned from carrying a load of rice to Singapore, and had returned for a second load. The crew of the junk was brought on board &quot;Bugara&quot; before their craft was destroyed by gunfire. Schade agreed to keep what he described as “one intelligent volunteer as interpreter.” The man was cleaned up, given a physical examination, and dressed up in dungarees. The rest of the junk crew complained that their lifeboat no longer was seaworthy, so Schade ordered &quot;Bugara&quot; to make a long haul around the minefield, approach the curve, and put the junk crew over the side in their lifeboat. He then decided, since it was now late, to instead allow the junk crew spend the night aboard &quot;Bugara&quot;, sleeping on empty torpedo skids, and put them aboard the first sailboat &quot;Bugara&quot; found as she continued her patrol.

=====29 July=====
On 29 July 1945, Schade noted the toll that the continuous operations had taken on his men and submarine, observing that crew members were tired, the guns needed cleaning, and the diesel engines needed routine maintenance after operating a full speed so much of the time while &quot;Bugara&quot; pursued targets. He decided to withdraw from shore, give the crew a rest day, and allow the crew to watch a movie for the first time during the war patrol. Shipping activity soon interfered with his plans. At 09:05, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank a large 200-gross register ton schooner carrying 200 barrels of sorghum molasses and flying the Japanese flag. At 13:25, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded a 400-gross register ton Imperial Japanese Navy auxiliary flying the flag of the Republic of China. The vessel had a certificate stating that her cargo of cocoa beans was for the Imperial Japanese Navy and that she was bound for Shōnan, Japan. After the vessel&#x27;s crew abandoned ship, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank her.

At 14:10, &quot;Bugara&quot; intercepted the 112-gross register ton junk &quot;Ayame&quot;, loaded with rice and headed toward Singapore. &quot;Bugara&quot;′s boarding party found that &quot;Ayame&quot;′s cargo did not agree with her Japanese manifest, which listed &quot;machinery&quot; as the cargo. After &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her with gunfire, &quot;Ayame&quot; came to rest on the bottom in of water with of mast showing above the surface. At 14:42, &quot;Bugara&quot; halted and searched a 50-gross register ton schooner flying the Thai flag and loaded with rice bound for Singapore, then sank her by gunfire. At 16:00, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts sighted a Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boat flying over the water at a very low altitude, but the big flying boat′s crew did not seem to spot &quot;Bugara&quot;.

Schade decided to put the native crew of the schooner ashore at dark, and looked over the coast of Koh Tan in order to find a safe-looking place to do so. Upon spotting what Schade described as a &quot;smart-looking village which we thought looked like Jap[anese] barracks,” Schade consulted with the interpreter and approved the site. &quot;Bugara&quot; put a four-man-sized rubber boat into the sea with one of &quot;Bugara&quot;′s officers and all seven natives aboard along with some food and clothing for the natives. At 22:20, the native crewmen expressed great sorrow at leaving &quot;Bugara&quot; and shook hands with &quot;almost everyone.&quot; Closing within of the beach and in only of water, &quot;Bugara&quot; dropped off the Thai sailors at the agreed-upon site, and by 23:40, the officer and the rubber boat were back on board &quot;Bugara&quot;.

=====30 July=====
At 09:40 on 30 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; examined a 30-gross register ton coastal cargo ship on her maiden voyage, manned by a Chinese crew of eight and proceeding from Singapore carrying sugar. The ship&#x27;s crew was delighted when &quot;Bugara&quot;′s boarding party came aboard, explained they had hoped a U.S. ship would find them, and then begged to stay aboard &quot;Bugara&quot;, one of them even making a special trip back aboard their ship to get a Japanese flag for &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew. Schade made one of the Chinese, who had graduated from a university in England, his interpreter, and &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew dubbed him &quot;Charlie Wong.&quot; All of the Chinese sailors cheered when &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank their ship by gunfire. At 10:40, &quot;Bugara&quot; sighted a plane flying toward her, and Schade quickly sent the Chinese crew below and dived. At 11:05, &quot;Bugara&quot; surfaced, and her crew recovered the Chinese sailors’ lifeboat and lashed it to the deck.

Nearly two hours later, at 13:00, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s boarding party raided the 29-gross register ton schooner &quot;Twako&quot;, flying the Rising Sun flag and carrying sugar from Singapore. &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gun crews sank &quot;Twako&quot;. By now, &quot;Bugara&quot; needed to conserve ammunition, and her guns were allowed to fire only two rounds to sink each target.

Several hours later, at 18:40, &quot;Bugara&quot; went alongside a seaworthy fishing boat and transferred her passengers with all of their gear to the smaller craft. Schade noted that the fishermen “were completely bewildered, but all seemed happy.” “Charlie Wong” performed introductions between the foreign crews and the American submariners.

&quot;Bugara&quot; next chased a 50-gross register ton &quot;sea truck&quot; which almost made it to the protective cover of the minefield before &quot;Bugara&quot; overtook and came alongside 
her. The vessel was loaded with rice and bound for Singapore. The 10 men aboard the vessel told &quot;Charlie Wong&quot; that pirates had taken their clothes, papers and lifeboat. Distrusting them, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s crew rigged a canvas from the aft gun so that they could shelter on &quot;Bugara&quot;′s deck for the night under guard by a &quot;Bugara&quot; sailor. &quot;Bugara&quot; then sank the &quot;sea truck&quot; with gunfire.

=====31 July=====
In the predawn darkness of 31 July 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; sighted and made radar contact on an unidentified ship. She tailed the vessel until dawn and then closed in for the kill. The ship she stalked turned out to be a 32-gross register ton coastal cargo ship bound for Singapore. At 08:11, after taking the crew and their lifeboat on deck, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank her with gunfire. At 09:05, five Japanese fighter planes, identified as Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi J2M &quot;Raiden&quot; (&quot;Thunderbolt&quot;) interceptor fighters (Allied reporting name &quot;Jack&quot;) flew in low at &quot;Bugara&quot;. Despite having her own crew at gun action stations and 17 natives, whatever they had brought with them from their sunken ships, and one of their lifeboats on deck, &quot;Bugara&quot; succeeded in getting everyone below and diving, although she lost the lifeboat in the process. Twenty minutes later, she surfaced, and her crew returned to gun stations. &quot;Bugara&quot; sighted three Japanese twin-engine aircraft but did not dive, and the Japanese planes drew away.

At 09:46, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s raiding party overtook a 40-gross register ton schooner flying the Imperial Japanese Navy flag. Her crew was brought on board &quot;Bugara&quot;, which sank her with the allotted two rounds of gunfire. Another contact popped up on radar, and &quot;Bugara&quot; gave chase. At 10:20, &quot;Bugara&quot; sighted a single-engine fighter at a range of but did not submerge. The fighter flew down &quot;Bugara&quot;′s starboard side but did not engage her. Fifteen minutes later a twin-engined floatplane also flew past on &quot;Bugara&quot;′ starboard side. Schade ordered &quot;Bugara&quot; to resume her pursuit of the vessel, and the raiding party boarded what turned out to be a 100-gross register ton schooner bound for Bali in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies carrying a cargo of rice and salt. All of the schooner&#x27;s papers had been lost, but the captured crew admitted the cargo was intended for Japanese use. Two rounds quickly sank the schooner.

At 11:10, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts spotted two Aichi E13A Type 0 reconnaissance seaplanes (Allied reporting name &quot;Jake&quot;) that closed on her fast just as she dived. The presence of Japanese aircraft in her operating area led Schade to worry that it might be difficult to release safely the 25 captured crewmen she now had aboard.

At 14:10, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank a brand-new 37-gross register ton coastal cargo ship flying the Rising Sun flag after its crew abandoned ship. It had been carrying sugar from Singapore to Champon, Thailand. The boarding party then moved on to contact number 40 of &quot;Bugara&quot;′s war patrol, a 33-ton coastal cargo ship also flying the Imperial Japanese Navy ensign, and &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank her. At 14:32, &quot;Bugara&quot; closed the coast, where her lookouts spotted a number of fishing boats. Stopping alongside one of the larger ones, &quot;Bugara&quot; transferred the 25 captured crewmen she had aboard to it.

Moving on at 15:00, Bugara received word of a downed United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber to the north, and set off at full speed to search for its crew, Schade hoping that other submarines could join &quot;Bugara&quot; so that they could mount a coordinated search. The submarine joined &quot;Bugara&quot; at 22:00, but the submarines were forced to wait until dawn to begin their search, as it was too dangerous to conduct a rescue in hostile waters at night.

=====1–4 August=====
At 03:15 on 1 August 1945, the submarine joined &quot;Bugara&quot; and &quot;Lamprey&quot;, and at dawn the three submarines formed a scouting line and began a coordinated search for the missing B-24′s crew. At 15:30, &quot;Bugara&quot; received orders to halt the search. She passed these orders to the commanding officers of &quot;Cobia&quot; and &quot;Lamprey&quot; and parted company with the other two submarines. At 16:00, &quot;Bugara&quot; returned to her patrol station.

On 2 August 1945, after sighting a large schooner, &quot;Bugara&quot; closed with and boarded her. The 211-gross register ton schooner carried a cargo from Singapore of what her manifest called &quot;miscellaneous gear,&quot; but &quot;Bugara&quot;′s boarding party was unable to make a good search in the dark, so &quot;Bugara&quot; took off the schooner′s crew and two lifeboats and sank her with gunfire. Soon after, one of the lifeboats sank. The other was too heavy to haul on deck, so &quot;Bugara&quot; towed it behind her. At 04:00, that lifeboat also sank after it became caught in the port screw, damaging it.

At 08:09 on 2 August 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded a 20-gross register ton Malaccan coastal cargo ship carrying coffee. Because she was flying the Japanese flag, &quot;Bugara&quot; removed her crew and sank her with gunfire. &quot;Bugara&quot; next made the 43rd contact of her war patrol, which proved to be a new 180-gross register ton schooner on a voyage from Singapore flying the Rising Sun flag. &quot;Bugara&quot; searched and sank her as well. &quot;Bugara&quot; subsequently boarded, examined, and sank an 18-gross register ton coastal cargo ship, a 117-gross register ton schooner, and a new Japanese 150-gross register ton schooner. While &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank the latter schooner, six large Malayan canoes manned by with a Chinese crew carrying rice arrived on the scene. Pirates, who already had killed two members of the Chinese crew, were pursuing the canoes, which &quot;Bugara&quot; brought on board. The pirates tried to flee, but &quot;Bugara&quot; opened gunfire on them and destroyed their boats, much to the pleasure of the Chinese crew. &quot;Bugara&quot; then put the Chinese ashore.

&quot;Bugara&quot; sank two more vessels on 3 August 1945, a 56-gross register ton &quot;sea truck&quot; loaded with rice and the 100-gross register ton Imperial Japanese Navy &quot;Junk No. 2218&quot;. A &quot;Bugara&quot; boarding party removed the crews from both craft before &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank them with the standard allotment of two rounds each. On 4 August 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank three more vessels: a 50-gross register ton coastal cargo ship, a 300-gross register ton junk, and a 450-gross register ton schooner carrying copra and coconut oil. Later that day, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s lookouts noted two Imperial Japanese Navy Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boats, the first at a range of and the second searching in the area where she sank all three vessels. This second Japanese plane flew so close to &quot;Bugara&quot; that her crew could see its markings clearly.

=====5–12 August=====
At 07:40 on 5 August 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; boarded, searched, and sank a 200-gross register ton schooner heavily loaded with coffee, sugar, sewing machines, and other gear. &quot;Bugara&quot; next sank a 75-gross register ton junk. &quot;Bugara&quot; then chased a small 20-gross register ton junk which beached herself at Lem Chong Pra. The crew fled before &quot;Bugara&quot; could capture them, so &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gun crews hit the junk amidships with one shell and &quot;Bugara&quot; left her to sink. At 17:10 the submarine surfaced nearby, and &quot;Bugara&quot; went alongside &quot;Ray&quot; to exchange information. Later that evening, at 19:30, &quot;Bugara&quot; spotted two vessels behind the island of Koh Khai. &quot;Bugara&quot; allowed herself to be seen patrolling the seaward side of the island as both vessels hid behind it. At sunset, &quot;Bugara&quot; closed with them. The crew of the first vessel, a 64-gross register ton schooner at anchor, quickly abandoned ship as &quot;Bugara&quot; closed in, and &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners sank her. It had become too dark for &quot;Bugara&quot; to find the second vessel, so she cleared the area.

On 6 August 1945, &quot;Bugara&quot; took station in the narrows of Samui Strait in the hope of finding more targets. Having misjudged the fathom curve by a few nautical miles and finding herself in shallow water, she headed back to safe water and soon found her first target of the day, a 125-gross register ton junk bound from Singapore for Bangkok with a cargo of rice. The captain of the junk proved reluctant to part with his Japanese flag, but was eventually persuaded to relinquish it. &quot;Bugara&quot; took off the junk&#x27;s crew and sank her with gunfire. After also sinking a brand new coastal cargo ship with a gross register tonnage &quot;Bugara&quot; estimated at 30 — although the ship&#x27;s papers gave it as 16.6 — and four more junks, Bugara sighted a submarine at 20:03 which turned out to be the British , a Royal Navy submarine also operating in the Gulf of Siam and investigating the four junks. &quot;Bugara&quot; decided to assist &quot;Sleuth&quot; in her search-and-destroy efforts and boarded and sank with gunfire two more vessels, a 26-gross register ton junk flying the Japanese flag and a 75-gross register ton schooner loaded with aviation gasoline which &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners set ablaze.

After exchanging information with &quot;Sleuth&quot;′s crew, &quot;Bugara&quot; made a radar contact at 22:46 which came into sight. &quot;Bugara&quot; closed in on the vessel, a 60-gross register ton junk, firing a burst of 20-millimeter fire to grab her attention. The junk′s crew abandoned ship, leaving her with her sails up with a stiff wind blowing and making it difficult for &quot;Bugara&quot; to go alongside her. Despite this, &quot;Bugara&quot; brought her crew aboard, sent the junk to the bottom with the usual two shots, and then released the junk&#x27;s crew near shore.

=====7–15 August 1945=====
&quot;Bugara&quot; sank two more coastal cargo ships on 7 August 1945. She sank the first, a new 26.5-gross register ton vessel flying the Imperial Japanese Navy ensign, at 07:50. The second, a slightly larger 28-gross register ton vessel loaded with rice bound for Singapore, became &quot;Bugara&quot;′s last victim of World War II. At 15:50, &quot;Bugara&quot; passed through floating wreckage, finding many large cases and gasoline drums. She salvaged a case and found it full of Imperial Japanese Army mess kits. &quot;Bugara&quot;′s gunners opened fire on the drums and cases with .50 and .30-caliber machine guns, and in a matter of minutes many gasoline fires had started all around &quot;Bugara&quot;.

After sighting two Japanese aircraft, &quot;Bugara&quot; dived. After she surfaced, she sighted four possible medium junks and two sailing vessels close to shore between Hilly Cape and Patani Roads at 19:40. Suddenly, she sighted a periscope at a distance of only . Schade reported that &quot;It was so large and steady we did not believe it was a scope and passed it close aboard.&quot; He decided to ignore the periscope and close with the other vessels. The sailboats were native-owned and carrying tapioca, so &quot;Bugara&quot; let them go on their way. The remaining vessels were beached, and Schade decided not to close any further as darkness prevented him from determining what was in the vicinity close to shore. HMS &quot;Sleuth&quot; suddenly surfaced astern of &quot;Bugara&quot;, and Schade noted it had been &quot;Sleuth&quot;′s periscope that Bugara sighted earlier. At 24:00, &quot;Bugara&quot; departed the area in accordance with her operation order to conclude her patrol.

&quot;Bugara&quot; started a southbound transit of Lombok Strait at 19:00 on 12 August 1945, clearing the passage three hours later. She then set course for Fremantle, Australia. During her passage through the Indian Ocean from Lombok Strait to Fremantle, hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945.

Schade received a Bronze Star Medal for his command of &quot;Bugara&quot; during her highly successful third patrol, one he remembered as &quot;one of the most colorful to be made during the war.&quot; During the patrol, &quot;Bugara&quot; sank 57 small ships with an aggregate gross register tonnage of 5,284. Her victims included 12 junks totaling 1,162 gross register tons, 24 schooners totaling 3,057 gross register tons, 16 coastal cargo ships totaling 489 gross register tons, three &quot;sea trucks&quot; totaling 156 gross register tons, a 400-gross register ton naval auxiliary, and a 20-gross register ton terengganu. &quot;Bugara&quot; and her crew received the Submarine Combat Patrol insignia for the patrol.

===1945–1950===

On 17 August 1945 &quot;Bugara&quot; arrived at Fremantle, Australia, concluding her final war patrol. After a few days, she proceeded to Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, joining the other submarines of her squadron there. She operated from Subic Bay until January 1946, when she received orders to proceed to Pearl Harbor and then continue on to San Diego, California. She reached San Diego in February 1946, and her crew took leave in groups until mid-March 1946. After intensive daily training underway, &quot;Bugara&quot; proceeded to Pearl Harbor, her new home port, in May 1946 and reported for duty with Submarine Squadron 5.

On 28 May 1946, &quot;Bugara&quot; took part in training off Oahu during which she sank the captured Japanese submarine as a torpedo target to keep technology out of Soviet hands as relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated prior to the onset of the Cold War. On 21 June 1946, &quot;Bugara&quot; began an overhaul at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. After completion of the overhaul, she made a training cruise into the Bering Sea and port visits to Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, before returning to Pearl Harbor.

Through all of 1947, &quot;Bugara&quot; pursued an intensive training and operations schedule. During the summer of 1947, she put to sea in company with the submarines and for a coordinated attack exercise against the battleship in the Hawaiian Islands. Taking up a position in the Alenuihaha Channel, the submarines attempted to intercept the battleship as she made a high-speed run between Maui and the island of Hawaii. Although &quot;Iowa&quot; enjoyed land-based air cover and tried to throw off her pursuers by several radical course changes, the submarines still achieved four &quot;successful&quot; mock attacks against the battleship. &quot;Bugara&quot; participated in Navy Day exercises at Stockton, California, in October 1947. In November 1947, she took part in fleet exercises off Southern California under Commander, First Task Fleet. On 14 November 1947, during a submerged practice attack against the destroyer , &quot;Bugara&quot; collided with &quot;Orleck&quot;, suffering a jammed periscope and radar but able to proceed without assistance. Investigation of the damage soon thereafter revealed the periscope shears bent 10 degrees, with the lower periscope jammed in the lower position. &quot;Bugara&quot; underwent repairs and an overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California, between 20 November 1947 and 19 March 1948.

&quot;Bugara&quot; departed San Francisco on 27 March 1948 and made for Pearl Harbor, where she reported for duty with Submarine Squadron 5 on 7 April 1948. She spent the next six weeks in training, often rendering services to other U.S. Navy units, as well as conducting a short United States Naval Reserve training cruise in the Hawaiian Islands from Pearl Harbor to Kauai from 30 April to 2 May 1948. 

On 21 May 1948, &quot;Bugara&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Melbourne, Australia. During her voyage, one of her crewmen fell ill, and she diverted on 29 May 1948 to make an unscheduled stop at Pago Pago on Tutuila in American Samoa, where she transferred the sailor ashore on 30 May 1948 for treatment at the U.S. Naval Dispensary at Pago Pago. On 31 May 1948, &quot;Bugara&quot; departed Pago Pago and resumed her voyage to Melbourne, where she arrived on 9 June 1948. She departed for Perth in Western Australia on 11 June, arriving there on 18 June 1948. After a four-day stay, she put to sea once again on 22 June 1948 bound for Guam in the Mariana Islands. She arrived at Guam on 4 July 1948, where she underwent repairs. After their completion, she rendered services to surface ships and aircraft in the Guam area from 16 to 22 July 1948, then departed for Pagan in the Mariana Islands, where she conducted shore bombardment exercises and landed stores and passengers for United States Marine Corps forces stationed there. Her next port of call was Yokosuka, Japan, where she arrived on 27 July 1948. she also made stops at Tsingtao, China, and Buckner Bay  on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands.

&quot;Bugara&quot; was conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises off Okinawa on 9 August 1948 when Tropical Storm Chris struck with winds as high as . In company with ships of Destroyer Squadron 1, which formed an evasion group, &quot;Bugara&quot; proceeded south to avoid the tropical storm. On 10 August 1948, having gotten off the track of the storm, &quot;Bugara&quot; set course for Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, arriving there on 19 August 1948. After a brief stay, she set course for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 24 August 1948. Throughout the remainder of 1948 and until August 1949, &quot;Bugara&quot; engaged in local operations in Hawaiian waters from Pearl Harbor, providing services to many ships and aircraft in the area and engaging in training of her own crew.

On 13 August 1949 &quot;Bugara&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1950 and subsequently engaged in local operations in Hawaiian waters.

===Korean War===
While &quot;Bugara&quot; was in Hawaii, the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 when North Korean forces invaded South Korea. In September 1950, she departed Pearl Harbor for the Far East, where she supported United Nations forces fighting on the Korean Peninsula. She suffered damage while in Japan, and had to cut her tour short to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. After completion of her repairs and the end of the Christmas holiday season in late December 1950, &quot;Bugara&quot; once more departed for the Far East, where she again supported United Nations forces in Korea from January to June 1951.

===1951–1954===
On 27 June 1951, &quot;Bugara&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor to enter the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her fourth overhaul. During this overhaul, she was converted for submarine snorkel operations and had a new, streamlined conning tower fairwater installed, the first time the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard undertook such work. &quot;Bugara&quot; completed her overhaul on 15 November 1951 and resumed local operations in Hawaiian waters. In May 1952, she departed Pearl Harbor for a cruise to Port Angeles, Washington; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada. On 28 June 1952, she returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed operations off Oahu.

During an antisubmarine warfare exercise south of Barbers Point, Oahu, on 3 August 1952, &quot;Bugara&quot; came to periscope depth and saw a bow with the number &quot;634&quot; painted on it very close and approaching fast at . It was the destroyer escort , which collided with &quot;Bugara&quot;, damaging her upper sail and periscopes. &quot;Bugara&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs to her conning tower. According to Rick Farris, a former crew member on motor watch aboard &quot;Bugara&quot; during the collision, “The impact caused the boat to roll severely, take a steep down angle, and plunge deeper, giving every indication a forward compartment had flooded and we were headed to the bottom.” Damage control efforts stopped the flooding and &quot;Bugara&quot; managed to surface. “Damage was fairly serious,” Farris claimed. “The small pump room flooded, both [peri]scopes required replacement, the upper half of the sail and [periscope] shears needed extensive repairs…We were in the [ship]yard [for] several weeks and the cost was, I&#x27;m sure, substantial.” 

After completing her repairs and conducting work-ups and local operations in Hawaiian waters from Pearl Harbor, &quot;Bugara&quot; visited Hilo, Hawaii, then entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an overhaul on 22 June 1953. After its completion, she departed Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1953 bound for Puget Sound in Washington, where she remained for the next two months. She then returned to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 23 December 1953. &quot;Bugara&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 6 April 1954, for her fifth deployment to the western Pacific. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 October 1954, and resumed the routine of rendering services to other types of naval units in Hawaiian waters. On 7 December 1954, she departed Pearl Harbor for San Diego, where she arrived on 15 December 1954.

===1955–1959===
On 26 May 1955, &quot;Bugara&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her sixth regular overhaul. The shipyard made extensive changes to provide improved habitability for the crew. Following the overhaul, her home port changed to San Diego on 1 August 1955, and she reported for duty there as a unit of Submarine Squadron 3. Throughout 1956, she rendered services in the San Diego area and participated in several special fleet exercises along the United States West Coast.

&quot;Bugara&quot; departed San Diego on 1 February 1957 for her sixth cruise to the western Pacific and took part in various exercises with the United States Seventh Fleet before returning to San Diego. She moved to San Francisco and began her seventh overhaul there. It lasted from 5 September 1957 to 19 March 1958. Upon its completion, she returned to San Diego and resumed local operations. In August 1958 she made another cruise to the Puget Sound area to operate in support of Naval Torpedo Station Keyport. Washington, and spend a weekend in Seattle during the local Seafair celebration.

On 7 January 1959, Bugara departed San Diego for her seventh cruise to the Western Pacific. During this six-month deployment, she visited several ports, including Buckner Bay and Naha on Okinawa; Subic Bay and Manila on Luzon in the Philippines; Hong Kong; and Yokosuka, Japan. Upon completion of the deployment, &quot;Bugara&quot; returned to San Diego on 2 July 1959. From 14 to 16 August 1959, she visited Long Beach, California, for submarine U.S. Naval Reserve submarine training cruises, then called at San Francisco from 24 to 25 October 1959.

She also provided training services to U.S. Naval Reserve submarine units from Portland, Oregon, and Tacoma and Seattle, Washington, and she made port visits at Seattle, Tacoma, and Everett, Washington, and Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On 25 May 1960, she departed Puget Sound en route San Francisco, where she made a two-day visit. She returned to San Diego on 12 June 1960.

From San Diego, &quot;Bugara&quot; resumed local operations. During most of July 1960, she participated in Exercise Meadowlark and Exercise Uppercut. On 24 September 1960, she proceeded to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for an overhaul.

With her overhaul complete, &quot;Bugara&quot; made for Naval Torpedo Station, Keyport, Washington, on 2 February 1961 for a shakedown cruise and fire-control system checks. While in the Puget Sound area, she made recreational visits to Port Angeles, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On 13 February 1961, she departed Vancouver bound for San Diego, and after arriving there on 17 February 1961 she commenced refresher training. After the completion of refresher training in early March 1961, she began preparations for a Far East cruise and operations with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. During that cruise, she took part in three hunter-killer exercises, two fleet exercises, one antisubmarine warfare exercise with Republic of China Navy units, and one Republic of China Marine Corps landing exercise. She also made port calls at Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Hakodate, Japan; Kaohsiung on Taiwan; Manila and Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands; Naha on Okinawa; Hong Kong; Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands; and Pearl Harbor. Bugara was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; award as the outstanding ship in Submarine Division 31 for fiscal year 1961, which ran from 1 July 1960 to 30 June 1961. On 17 December 1961, she returned to San Diego.

From 1 January to 26 April 1962, &quot;Bugara&quot; participated in operations off San Diego. On 30 April 1962 she arrived in Seattle for a five-day stay to participate in the Century 21 Exposition, also known as the Seattle World′s Fair, and to allow her crew to enjoy shore leave. On 5 May 1962, she got underway for San Diego, where she conducted local operations until 29 May 1962. From 30 May to 18 June 1962, she was in interim drydocking at San Diego, and for the remainder of 1962 operated just off San Diego except for a three-week trip to Pearl Harbor during November. For the second consecutive year, &quot;Bugara&quot; was awarded the Battle “E” as the outstanding submarine in Submarine Division 31 during the fiscal year 1962, which ran from1 July 1961 to 30 June 1962. She was also twice awarded the Fire Control Efficiency Award, presented for excellence in fire control and weapon performance during fiscal year 1962.

On 29 December 1962, &quot;Bugara&quot; departed San Diego for a seven-week operation in the Puget Sound area. She returned to San Diego on 20 February 1963. Following three weeks of upkeep, her crew painted a white hash mark on her sail signifying her third consecutive Battle “E” award, and she continued workups and other duties in the San Diego area. Her next overhaul period began at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, on 22 July 1963 and lasted until 11 February 1964.

After a brief workup and training period in the Pacific Ocean, &quot;Bugara&quot; was assigned duty with the U.S. Seventh Fleet for another deployment to the Western Pacific beginning on 16 April 1964. She stopped at Pearl Harbor to have main generators 1 and 2 replaced and reported back for duty with the Seventh Fleet on 26 May 1964. During her deployment, she provided services to aircraft and surface ships of the U.S. Navy, Republic of China Navy, and Philippine Navy.

===Vietnam War===
During &quot;Bugara&quot;′s Western Pacific deployment, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident of 2 and 4 August 1964 brought the United States into direct involvement in the Vietnam War. As a result of the incident, &quot;Bugara&quot; was assigned to Task Force 77 for operations in the South China Sea between 8 August and 4 September 1964. She arrived at San Diego on 22 October 1964, having traveled during her deployment, making port calls at Cebu City on Cebu Island in the Visayas in the Philippines; Hong Kong; Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines, and Yokosuka, Japan. After returning to San Diego, &quot;Bugara&quot; commenced local operations until she entered Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and San Francisco for a battery renewal in June 1965. With it complete, she returned to San Diego.

&quot;Bugara&quot; left San Diego on 18 October 1965 for another cruise in support of U.S. Seventh Fleet operations off Vietnam. While en route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor, where she was completely outfitted with the Steinke hood device for escape from a disabled submarine. During her deployment, she also made port calls at Yokosuka, Japan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 15 November 1965, she celebrated the 21st anniversary of her commissioning by making her 6,000th dive. By the end of 1965, she was at Subic Bay with the U.S. Seventh Fleet and during her deployment she conducted operations and training with units of the U.S., Philippine Navy, Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, and Republic of China Navy. On 1 May 1966, while transiting the Lombok Strait southbound to the Indian Ocean, &quot;Bugara&quot; honored her sister ship , lost on 6 August 1945 during World War II, with a wreath-laying ceremony. &quot;Bugara&quot; then made her first port visit to Fremantle, Australia, since August 1945, returning as the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force representative for the annual commemoration of Australia&#x27;s celebration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, which had occurred during World War II from 4 to 8 May 1942. During her return voyage to the United States, &quot;Bugara&quot; crosseed the junction of the equator and International Date Line on 17 May 1966. She traveled during her deployment.

&quot;Bugara&quot; began an overhaul at San Francisco&#x27;s Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard in October 1966. After its completion on 25 April 1967, she conducted successful post-overhaul sea trials and shakedown from then until 20 May 1967. Immediately after shakedown, and until 15 June 1967, she visited the Dabob Bay Torpedo Testing Facility in Puget Sound for fire-control system checks and calibrations. From 15 June to 1 October 1967, she provided services to Eastern Pacific units assigned to Commander, United States First Fleet. During this training, she sank the decommissioned destroyer escort as a target with a Mark 14 Mod. 5 torpedo in a war shot test. She also received the Battle “E” award again during this period. She then immediately began preparations for her own deployment to the Western Pacific with the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

The beginning of 1968 found &quot;Bugara&quot; in Subic Bay, halfway through her deployment. As her deployment continued into 1968, she visited Bangkok, Thailand; Keelung and Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and Yokosuka, Japan. During January 1968, she hosted several newsmen while operating in the Gulf of Tonkin off North Vietnam and was featured on American television in an episode of &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; on NBC. On 1 February 1968, her crew participated in a people-to-people program with the inhabitants of the island of Ko Samui, Thailand. During the visit the submariners distributed books, toys, vitamins, and athletic equipment and, in conjunction with the Royal Thai Navy, constructed basketball backboards and ping-pong tables. They concluded the one-day goodwill visit with a joint picnic and Hollywood movies for the islanders. While at Yokosuka, Japan, from 10 to 20 April 1968, &quot;Bugara&quot; hosted the crew of the British submarine . On 27 April 1968, &quot;Bugara&quot; departed Yokosuka, made a half-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, and proceeded to San Diego, which she reached on 16 May 1968.

From 16 May to 18 June 1968, &quot;Bugara&quot; underwent upkeep at San Diego. From 19 June to 1 August 1968 she provided services to Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific, and Commander Training Command, Pacific, and conducted individual ship exercises and additional underway training.

From 14 to 21 August 1968, &quot;Bugara&quot; participated in Strike Ex-68, a major fleet exercise off the coast of Southern California, and Commander, U.S. First Fleet, and Commander, Submarine Flotilla 1, both commended her for her performance during the exercise. She spent in port, engaged in submarine crew training, and providing services for Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. From 17 September to 10 October 1968, she underwent repairs at Campbell Machine Company in San Diego, with post-repair sea trials conducted on 10 October. From 22 to 25 October 1968, she provided services for the submarine off San Francisco, followed by a one-day visit to San Francisco. On 30 October 1968, she conducted a demonstration cruise for Pacific Southwest Airlines employees at San Diego. From , she again provided services for &quot;Gurnard&quot; off San Francisco. She spent the remainder of 1968 in port except for seven days of training and individual ship&#x27;s exercises at sea.

From 1 to 26 January 1969, &quot;Bugara&quot; conducted workups off Southern California, in preparation for another deployment to the Western Pacific. Underway from 27 January to 26 February 1969, en route from San Diego, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor before passing through San Bernardino Strait in the Philippines for a port visit at Subic Bay on Luzon. Other ports she visited during her cruise included Manila; Hong Kong; Bangkok and Sattahip, Thailand; and Kaoshiung, Taiwan. From 19 February to 20 July 1969 she was assigned as a unit of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. This period was highlighted by 33 days of services on Yankee Station, including participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) exercise Sea Spirit with units of the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, British Royal Navy, Philippine Navy, and Royal Thai Navy. She also provided services for the Seventh Fleet off the coast of Vietnam.

On 20 July 1969, &quot;Bugara&quot; receuved orders to proceed to Yokosuka, Japan, and then to San Diego, where she arrived on 4 August 1969. From 5 August to 14 November 1969, she participated in Fleet Exercise StrikeEx 4-69 and provided services to various units of the U.S. First Fleet. On 1 October, her hull classification symbol reverted to SS-331. On 2 October 1969, she departed San Diego for the Puget Sound area to render services to the submarine . While in the vicinity, she also provided assistance to Canadian air and surface units from 7 to 9 October 1969.

&quot;Bugara&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 14 November 1969 and celebrated her 25th anniversary of commissioning on 15 November while preparing for interim drydocking. At the shipyard, she accomplished a battery renewal that was completed on 3 December 1969. She then returned to San Diego for Christmas holiday leave and upkeep.

==Decommissioning==
During 1970, the U.S. Navy deemed the five remaining Fleet Snorkel submarines — &quot;Bugara&quot;, , , , and — &quot;far below the standards of a Guppy III submarine&quot; and prohibitively expensive to modernize. The Board of Inspection and Survey found &quot;Bugara&quot; unfit for further naval service and recommended she be stricken from the Naval Vessel Register.

&quot;Bugara&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1970 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She was transferred from the custody of Commander, Submarine Group, San Francisco Bay Area, to that of Commanding Officer, Inactive Ship Facility, Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She was selected for sinking as a target along with the decommissioned attack cargo ships and in tests of the Mark 48 torpedo off the coast of Washington. The testing schedule originally called for the submarine to sink &quot;Bugara&quot; sometime during the week of 23 May 1971, but at the beginning of June 1971 the test had not yet been carried out and &quot;Bugara&quot; remained afloat.

==Loss==
On 1 June 1971, &quot;Bugara&quot;, with no crew aboard, was under tow by the fleet tug to Bangor Naval Ammunition Depot at Bangor, Washington, when &quot;Cree&quot;′s crew noticed &quot;Bugara&quot;′s trim change rapidly. &quot;Cree&quot; slowed to heave a tow line at a distance of , and although her towing detail was fully manned at the time, the wire towing &quot;Bugara&quot; slipped out of the brake. Suddenly, &quot;Bugara&quot;′s bow rose sharply at 13:58 and she sank rapidly, disappearing beneath the surface at 14:00 in of water near Cape Flattery, Washington. At risk of being pulled down with &quot;Bugara&quot;, &quot;Cree&quot; cut the steel hawser tow cable.

==Wreck==
The wreck of &quot;Bugara&quot; lies under about of water in the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. The remotely operated underwater vehicle &quot;Hercules&quot;, deployed by the research vessel EV &quot;Nautilus&quot;, used an underwater camera system to take photos of the wreck during an archaeological survey of it in 2007.

<doc id="1136715" wikidata="Q1121886" url="?curid=1136715" title="Compositing">
<text>Compositing is the process or technique of combining visual elements from separate sources into single images, often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Live-action shooting for compositing is variously called &quot;chroma key&quot;, &quot;blue screen&quot;, &quot;green screen&quot; and other names. Today, most compositing is achieved through digital image manipulation. Pre-digital compositing techniques, however, go back as far as the trick films of Georges Méliès in the late 19th century, and some are still in use.

== Basic procedure ==
All compositing involves the replacement of selected parts of an image with other material, usually, but not always, from another image. In the digital method of compositing, software commands designate a narrowly defined color as the part of an image to be replaced. Then the software (e.g. Natron) replaces every pixel within the designated color range with a pixel from another image, aligned to appear as part of the original. For example, one could record a television weather presenter positioned in front of a plain blue or green background, while compositing software replaces only the designated blue or green color with weather maps.
== Typical applications ==
In television studios, blue or green screens may back news-readers to allow the compositing of stories behind them, before being switched to full-screen display. In other cases, presenters may be completely within compositing backgrounds that are replaced with entire &quot;virtual sets&quot; executed in computer graphics programs. In sophisticated installations, subjects, cameras, or both can move about freely while the computer-generated imagery (CGI) environment changes in real time to maintain correct relationships between the camera angles, subjects, and virtual &quot;backgrounds&quot;.

Virtual sets are also used in motion picture filmmaking, usually photographed in blue or green screen environments (other colors are possible but less common), as for example in &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;. More commonly, composited backgrounds are combined with sets – both full-size and models – and vehicles, furniture, and other physical objects that enhance the realism of the composited visuals. &quot;Sets&quot; of almost unlimited size can be created digitally because compositing software can take the blue or green color at the edges of a backing screen and extend it to fill the rest of the frame outside it. That way, subjects recorded in modest areas can be placed in large virtual vistas. 

Most common, perhaps, are set extensions: digital additions to actual performing environments. In the film &quot;Gladiator&quot;, for example, the arena and first tier seats of the Roman Colosseum were actually built, while the upper galleries (complete with moving spectators) were computer graphics, composited onto the image above the physical set. For motion pictures originally recorded on film, high-quality video conversions called &quot;digital intermediates&quot; enable compositing and other operations of computerized post production. Digital compositing is a type of matting, and one of four basic compositing methods. The others are physical compositing, multiple exposure, and background projection, a method which utilizes both front projection and rear projection.
== Physical compositing ==

In physical compositing the separate parts of the image are placed together in the photographic frame and recorded in a single exposure. The components are aligned so that they give the appearance of a single image. The most common physical compositing elements are partial models and glass paintings.

Partial models are typically used as set extensions such as ceilings or the upper stories of buildings. The model, built to match the actual set but on a much smaller scale, is hung in front of the camera, aligned so that it appears to be part of the set. 
Models are often quite large because they must be placed far enough from the camera so that both they and the set far beyond them are in sharp focus.

Glass shots are made by positioning a large pane of glass so that it fills the camera frame, and is far enough away to be held in focus along with the background visible through it. The entire scene is painted on the glass, except for the area revealing the background where action is to take place. This area is left clear. Photographed through the glass, the live action is composited with the painted area. A classic example of a glass shot is the approach to Ashley Wilkes&#x27; plantation in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The plantation and fields are all painted, while the road and the moving figures on it are photographed through the glass area left clear.

A variant uses the opposite technique: most of the area is clear, except for individual elements (photo cutouts or paintings) affixed to the glass. For example, a ranch house could be added to an empty valley by placing an appropriately scaled and positioned picture of it between the valley and the camera.

==Multiple exposure==

An in-camera multiple exposure is made by recording on only one part of each film frame, rewinding the film to exactly the same start point, exposing a second part, and repeating the process as needed. The resulting negative is a composite of all the individual exposures. (By contrast, a &quot;double exposure&quot; records multiple images on the entire frame area, so that all are partially visible through one another.) Exposing one section at a time is made possible by enclosing the camera lens (or the whole camera) in a light-tight box fitted with maskable openings, each one corresponding to one of the action areas. Only one opening is revealed per exposure, to record just the action positioned in front of it.

Multiple exposure is difficult because the action in each recording must match that of the others; thus, multiple-exposure composites typically contain only two or three elements. However, as early as 1900 Georges Méliès used seven-fold exposure in &quot;L&#x27;homme-orchestre/The One-man Band&quot;; and in the 1921 film &quot;The Playhouse&quot;, Buster Keaton used multiple exposures to appear simultaneously as nine different actors on a stage, perfectly synchronizing all nine performances.

== Background projection ==

Background projection throws the background image on a screen behind the subjects in the foreground while the camera makes a composite by photographing both at once. The foreground elements conceal the parts of the background image behind them. Sometimes, the background is projected from the front, reflecting off the screen but not the foreground subjects because the screen is made of highly directional, exceptionally reflective material. (The prehistoric opening of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; uses front projection.) However, rear projection has been a far more common technique.

In rear projection, (often called process shooting) background images (called &quot;plates&quot;, whether they are still pictures or moving) are photographed first. For example, a camera car may drive along streets or roads while photographing the changing scene behind it. In the studio, the resulting &quot;background plate&quot; is loaded into a projector with the film &quot;flipped&quot; (reversed), because it will be projected onto (and through) the back of a translucent screen. A car containing the performers is aligned in front of the screen so that the scenery appears through its rear and/or side windows. A camera in front of the car records both the foreground action and the projected scenery, as the performers pretend to drive.

Like multiple exposure, rear projection is technically difficult. The projector and camera motors must be synchronized to avoid flicker and perfectly aligned behind and before the screen. The foreground must be lit to prevent light spill onto the screen behind it. (For night driving scenes, the foreground lights are usually varied as the car &quot;moves&quot; along.) The projector must use a very strong light source so that the projected background is as bright as the foreground. Color filming presents additional difficulties, but can be quite convincing, as in several shots in the famous crop duster sequence in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. (Much of the sequence, however, was shot on location.) Because of its complexity, rear projection has been largely replaced by digital compositing with, for example, the car positioned in front of a blue or green screen.

== Matting ==

Traditional matting is the process of compositing two different film elements by printing them, one at a time, onto a duplicate strip of film. After one component is printed on the duplicate, the film is re-wound and the other component is added. Since the film cannot be exposed twice without creating a double exposure, the blank second area must be masked while the first is printed; then the freshly exposed first area must be masked while the second area is printed. Each masking is performed by a &quot;traveling matte&quot;: a specially altered duplicate shot which lies on top of the copy film stock.

Like its digital successor, traditional matte photography uses a uniformly colored backing – usually (but not always) a special blue or green. Because a matching filter on the camera lens screens out only the backing color, the background area records as black, which, on the camera&#x27;s negative film, will develop clear.

First, a print from the original negative is made on high-contrast film, which records the backing as opaque and the foreground subject as clear. A second high-contrast copy is then made from the first, rendering the backing clear and the foreground opaque.

Next, a three-layer sandwich of film is run through an optical printer. On the bottom is the unexposed copy film. Above it is the first matte, whose opaque backing color masks the background. On top is the negative of the foreground action. On this pass, the foreground is copied while the background is shielded from exposure by the matte.

Then the process is repeated; but this time, the copy film is masked by the reverse matte, which excludes light from the foreground area already exposed. The top layer contains the background scene, which is now exposed only in the areas protected during the previous pass. The result is a positive print of the combined background and foreground. A copy of this composite print yields a &quot;dupe negative&quot; that will replace the original foreground shot in the film&#x27;s edited negative.

== Advantages of digital mattes ==

Digital matting has replaced the traditional approach for two reasons. In the old system, the five separate strips of film (foreground and background originals, positive and negative mattes, and copy stock) could drift slightly out of registration, resulting in halos and other edge artifacts in the result. Done correctly, digital matting is perfect, down to the single-pixel level. Also, the final dupe negative was a &quot;third generation&quot; copy, and film loses quality each time it is copied. Digital images can be copied without quality loss.

This means that multi-layer digital composites can easily be made. For example, models of a space station, a space ship, and a second space ship could be shot separately against blue screen, each &quot;moving&quot; differently. The individual shots could then be composited with one another, and finally with a star background. With pre-digital matting, the several extra passes through the optical printer would degrade the film quality and increase the probability of edge artifacts. Elements crossing behind or before one another would pose additional problems.

<text>Pacifier (re-released as The Pacifier Album) is the fifth studio album released by New Zealand rock band Shihad. At the time of the release, they were performing under the name Pacifier due to controversy surrounding the similarity of the word Shihad to jihad. The name &quot;Pacifier&quot; was derived from the single of the same name from their previous album, &quot;The General Electric&quot;.

Released on 19 August 2002, songs such as &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;Bullitproof&quot; went on to become hit singles. &quot;Bullitproof&quot; peaked at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks and number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks. However, it still failed to break the band into the United States. &quot;Everything&quot; was used in the closing credits of the 2002 film &quot;Swimfan&quot;.

The band, and lead singer Jon Toogood especially, have since expressed displeasure with the album, calling it &quot;overproduced&quot; and &quot;bullshit – that would&#x27;ve been the wrong album to be big on.&quot; In 2023, bassist Karl Kippenberger said, &quot;I love those songs. I love them being part of our history...It&#x27;s OK to fall in and out of love with your own stuff, you know?&quot;

This album features Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver) and DJ Lethal (Limp Bizkit and House of Pain) on the track &quot;Coming Down&quot;.

The album was produced by Josh Abraham, of Thirty Seconds to Mars/Michelle Branch/Weezer fame.

One version of this album included the &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; bonus disc and yet another version contained a bonus disc featuring live acoustic tracks from the &quot;Helen Young Sessions&quot;.

== &quot;The Pacifier Album&quot; re-release ==

In 2023, the album was re-released on vinyl. For this edition the band name is restored to Shihad and the album is retitled &quot;The Pacifier Album&quot;.

== Track listing ==
== Bonus discs ==
=== Weapons of Mass Destruction ===

<text>Lefse () is a traditional soft Norwegian flatbread. It is made with riced potatoes, can include all purpose (wheat) flour, and includes butter, and milk, cream, or lard. It is cooked on a large, flat griddle. Special tools are used to prepare lefse, including a potato ricer, long wooden turning sticks and special rolling pins with deep grooves.

== Flavoring ==

There are many ways of flavoring lefse. The most common is adding butter and sugar to the lefse and rolling it up. In Norway, this is known as . Other options include adding cinnamon, or spreading jelly, lingonberries, or gomme on it. Scandinavian-American variations include rolling it with a thin layer of peanut butter and sugar, with butter and white or brown sugar, with butter and corn syrup, or with butter and salt, or with ham and eggs. Also eaten with beef and other savory items like ribberull and mustard, it is comparable to a tortilla. Lefse is a traditional accompaniment to lutefisk, and the fish is often rolled up in the lefse.

== Variations ==
There are significant regional variations in Norway in the way lefse is made and eaten, but it generally resembles a flatbread, although in many parts of Norway, especially Valdres, it is far thinner.

 (&#x27;thin lefse&#x27;) is a variation made in central Norway. is rolled up with butter, sugar, and cinnamon (or with butter and brown sugar).

&#x27; or &#x27; is thicker and often served with coffee as a cake.

 (&#x27;potato lefse&#x27;) is similar to and used like , but made with potatoes.

 or is the smaller version of the potato lefse, and usually made with only boiled potatoes, flour and salt. It is often used in place of a hot dog bun and can be used to roll up sausages. This is also known as in Norway. Norway&#x27;s Constitution Day on May 17 is one of the most popular days to eat the dish. Toppings include ketchup and mustard, but can also include raw or crispy onions, and other types of relish. 

 is a variation common to Salten district in Nordland in Northern Norway. is eaten with a sweetened sauce made of &quot;brunost&quot;, a type of cheese, flour, and sugar. It is ready when is warm and the butter is melted.

 is a chunky small lefse. Made of butter, syrup, sugar, eggs, and flour. Originally created in western Norway as a treat for fishermen who worked at the Lofoten Fishery.

 is made on the coast of Hordaland. It resembles thin lefse but is slightly thicker, and it is stained by large amounts of whole aniseed.

==Hardangerlefse==

Another variety, the (from Hardanger in Norway), is made from yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (&quot;krotekake&quot;). It is often made with egg yolks and buttermilk instead of potatoes. The dough is rolled with a conventional rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F or 205 °C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze-dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.

Dried Hardangerlefse can be stored without refrigeration for six months or more, so long as it is kept dry. It is customarily thought that the bread (along with lutefisk) was a staple on the seagoing voyages as far back as Viking times.

The dry lefse is dipped in water, and then placed within a towel which has also been dipped in water and wrung out. Many people maintain that dipping in salted or seawater enhances the flavor. The dry lefse regains its bread-like texture in about 60 minutes. Often that time is used to prepare such ingredients as eggs or herring, which are wrapped in the lefse once it has softened.

==Lefse in the United States==
===Holidays===
Lefse is a Norwegian treat that is especially popular around the Christmas holidays. Many Scandinavian-Americans eat lefse primarily around Thanksgiving and Christmas.

===History===

====General====

While the Midwest almost always makes its lefse with potatoes, this is not necessarily the case in Norway. When one uses the term &quot;lefse&quot; in the United States, it typically refers to what Norwegians call potato lefse. Norwegians, however, also make Hardangerlefse with egg yolks and buttermilk. The tradition of making lefse was brought over by Norwegian Americans, and potato lefse itself was made when their potato crop was successful. Due to this, it became more prevalent than other types in the United States. When lefse was able to be made, it was stored in small storage buildings called . When Norwegian immigrants first arrived in America, they did not have the usual foods they were used to back home, including milk and porridge, dried meat, and lefse, but early Norwegian-American immigrants brought folded lefse to eat for the beginning stages of their journey via ship. After these were eaten, the lack of food they were used to is likely why they turned back to tradition so quickly. 

During World War I, Americans were encouraged to eat potatoes to be patriotic, as wheat was needed to feed the troops on the front lines. Lefse, a staple for Norwegian Americans, was eaten with gusto during this time.

While lefse is generally not eaten with day-to-day meals in Norway today, Norwegian Americans traditionally give prominence to having lefse with dinner.

====Keeping the tradition alive====
*Family members often gather to cook lefse as a group effort because the process is more enjoyable as a traditional holiday activity. This gathering also provides training to younger generations keeping the tradition alive.
*The Sons of Norway have lodges to teach making lefse to younger generations. A lodge in Vancouver, Washington, uses up to of potatoes to make lefse every month. While lefse used to be eaten as a snack food, it is now more often made in large quantities for such lutefisk dinners.
*Some professional lefse makers can roll 85 to 100 lefse per hour, or even up to 140.

===Where lefse is found===
In Norway today, most families tend to purchase their lefse rather than making it. While today&#x27;s Norwegian Americans consider making lefse at Christmas a tradition, more families are turning to purchase it from the store instead. Lefse can also be found in many grocery stores around Midwestern states and the Pacific Northwest states, including Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Oregon, Alaska, and Washington. Norsland Lefse, a factory in Rushford, Minnesota, produces about a half million rounds of lefse each year. The foodway of Scandinavian lefse stretches from the Midwest all the way through northeastern Montana. Small lefse factories dot the landscape throughout this area, mostly in Norwegian communities. In the larger of these communities, Lefse can be found in grocery stores year round. In the Red River Valley specifically, &quot;restaurants, supermarkets, and clubs all serve fish, lefse, and other specialties.&quot; Many United States Scandinavian festivals have booths to sell lefse, and it can also be ordered online.

===World&#x27;s largest lefse===
The town of Starbuck, Minnesota, is the home of the world&#x27;s largest lefse. It was made on July 1, 1983.

===Celebrations and festivals===
Lefse is celebrated in cities and towns with large Scandinavian populations. Fargo, North Dakota, hosts the popular Lutefisk and Lefse Festival in August each year. Fosston, Minnesota, invites area lefse makers to compete for the title of Champion Lefse Maker at its Lefse Fest in November. In Mankato, Minnesota, Minnesotans of Scandinavian descent celebrate lefse day, a day for cooking lefse, on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The Potato Days festival has been taking place in Barnesville, Minnesota, since the early 1930s; this festival also takes part in the National Lefse Cookoff.

===Rumors and jokes===
Rumors surrounding the initial use of lefse are the claims by Norwegian Americans that it was made by and used to sustain the Vikings, but potatoes were not introduced into Norway until long after the Vikings&#x27; time.

Although many Scandinavian-Americans do enjoy and eat the foods of their ethnic traditions, there is no shortage of tall-tales and jokes surrounding certain food, as well. Lefse was not excluded from these rumors. Among other things, lefse has been said to be &quot;so tasteless that many mistakenly eat the paper doily under the stack and do not know the difference.&quot;

===Integrating lefse into other foodways===
Sometimes Norwegian foods are integrated into other ethnic foodways. For example, one may use lefse to make enchilada. American lefse is sometimes served with butter, cinnamon sugar, brown sugar, or lingonberry jelly before being rolled, to be eaten like a crêpe. One may also add eggs, sausage, and cheese to make it into a breakfast burrito. One may even roll smørrebrød into their lefse.

<doc id="1136760" wikidata="Q1353934" url="?curid=1136760" title="Yung Wing">
<text>Yung Wing (; November 17, 1828April 21, 1912) was a Chinese-American diplomat and businessman. In 1854, he became the first Chinese student to graduate from an American university, Yale College. He was involved in business transactions between China and the United States and brought students from China to study in the United States on the Chinese Educational Mission. He became a naturalized American citizen, but his status was later revoked under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. 

==Early life==
After receiving his early education at a Mission School in Canton, Yung studied at Yale College to become, in 1854, the first-known Chinese student to graduate from an American university. He was a member and librarian of Brothers in Unity, a prominent Yale student literary society. His time at Yale was sponsored by Samuel Robbins Brown (1810–1880). In 1851, at the end of his freshman year, Yung wrote to Albert Booth, a fellow alumnus of Munson Academy and &quot;old Yale, where you have the satisfaction + honor to have gone through.&quot; Yung asked for Booth&#x27;s help in acquiring study materials and stated, &quot;Now you know probably the many disadvantages in which I labor aside from these additional studies.&quot; He was a member of the Phi chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

After finishing his studies, Yung returned to the Qing dynasty and worked with western missionaries as an interpreter. He was thought perhaps the first Chinese person to almost entirely master the English language.

==Republican activism==

In 1859, he accepted an invitation to the court of the Taiping rebels in Nanjing, but his proposals aimed at increasing the efficiency of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were all eventually refused. In 1863, Yung was dispatched to the United States by Zeng Guofan to buy machinery necessary for opening an arsenal in China capable of producing heavy weapons comparable with those of the western powers. The arsenal later became Jiangnan Shipyard.

He persuaded the Qing dynasty government to send young Chinese to the United States to study science and engineering. With the government&#x27;s eventual approval, he organized what came to be known as the Chinese Educational Mission, which included 120 young Chinese students, to study in the New England region of the United States beginning in 1872. The Educational Mission was disbanded in 1881, but many of the students later returned to China and made significant contributions to China&#x27;s civil services, engineering, and the sciences.

In 1874, he and the Hartford Pastor Joseph Twichell traveled to Peru to investigate the living conditions of Chinese coolies working there. Conditions were very brutal for the Chinese, and led to strikes and violent suppression.

Yung was a lifelong supporter of reform in China. He had followed the lead of the Guangxu Emperor, whom Yung described as the great pioneer of reform in China. The coup d&#x27;état of 1898 by the Empress Dowager Cixi aborted the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, and many of the reformers were decapitated. A price of $70,000 was placed on Yung&#x27;s head and he fled Shanghai to British Hong Kong.

While in Hong Kong, he applied to the US Consul to return to the US. In a 1902 letter from the US Secretary of State John Sherman, Yung was informed that his US citizenship, which he had held for 50 years, had been revoked and he would not be allowed to return to the United States. Through the help of friends, he was able to sneak into the United States in time to see his youngest son, Bartlett, graduate from Yale.

In 1908, Yung joined &quot;General&quot; Homer Lea, the former American military advisor to Kang Youwei, in a bold and audacious military venture in China called the &quot;Red Dragon Plan&quot; that called for organizing a revolutionary conspiracy to conquer Liangguang. Through Yung, Lea planned to solicit a united front of various southern Chinese factions and secret societies to organize an army that he would command for the revolution. If successful, Yung was slated to head a coalition government of revolutionary forces while Lea and his fellow conspirators hoped to receive wide-ranging economic concessions from the new government. The Red Dragon conspiracy subsequently collapsed.

After the Wuchang Uprising in the late fall of 1911, Sun Yat Sen wrote to Yung Wing requesting help to build the newly founded Republic of China; however, Yung was unable to go due to old age and illness. He requested his two sons to go in his place.

==Family and legacy==
Yung was naturalized as an American citizen on October 30, 1852, and in 1876, he married Mary Kellogg, an American. They had two children: Morrison Brown Yung and Bartlett Golden Yung. At Yale&#x27;s centennial commencement in 1876, Yung received an honorary Doctor of Laws.
After the failed 1908 uprising, Yung lived his twilight years in poverty in Hartford, Connecticut, and died in 1912. His grave is located at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford.

P.S. 124, a public elementary school at 40 Division St. in Chinatown in New York City, is named after Yung.

Yung was considered a possible namesake for one of Yale University&#x27;s new colleges which was completed in 2017.

In the prefecture city of Zhuhai, Guangdong, Yung Wing&#x27;s hometown, there is a private school named in honor of Yung Wing, the Yung Wing School - one of the most elite schools in the city. There is also a Yung Wing International Kindergarten there.

<text>Piacenza Calcio 1919, commonly referred to as Piacenza, is an Italian football club based in Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna. The club currently plays in Serie D.

Re-founded in 2012, Piacenza Calcio 1919 acquired the rights to use the brand of the original club Piacenza Calcio (also known as Piacenza F.C.) from Salva Piace.

== History ==


=== Foundation of Piacenza F.C. ===
Piacenza Football Club was founded in 1919 with &quot;Giovanni Dosi&quot; as the first club president. Dosi was an ambitious manager, taking control of every social, technical, and administrative aspect of the club, with the sole focus at bringing the club into the national championship under the FIGC.

After spending much of the club&#x27;s early life in the regional leagues, they entered into Serie C for the 1935–36 season, coming close to gaining promotion into Serie B during 1938 but lost out to Fanfulla.

==== From Serie B to Serie D ====

After World War II, Piacenza competed in Serie B for the first time, competing there for two seasons before falling back down to Serie C in 1948.

The club were punished for illicit sportsmanship in 1956 and were relegated to Serie D. This proved to be quite a heavy blow for the club as they would continue to yo-yo between Serie C and D until 1964. Piacenza finally returned to Serie B in 1969, under coach Tino Molinari and president Vincenzo Romagnoli.
Piacenza&#x27;s history until recent times was mostly undistinguished, with brief spells in Serie B in the 1940s and further spells in 1969–70, 1975–76, and 1987–88 to 1988–89.

==== Between Serie A and Serie B ====

Promotion in 1991 saw a rise in the side&#x27;s fortunes under coach Gigi Cagni, with the club promoted to Serie A for the first time in 1993, but was immediately relegated in the next season, despite the presence of players such as midfielder Daniele Moretti, winger Francesco Turrini, and forward Giampietro Piovani. For much of the season, Piacenza had battled into mid-table and were even a few points short of a European place, but were relegated on the last day of the season in a tight scrap. The club wisely chose to retain Cagni and most of his squad, and they would achieve promotion as Serie B champions in 1995.

The following five years saw the club win many supporters with its all-Italian lineup and successful battles against relegation. This period also saw Piacenza produce a generation of talented players from its youth academy, such as future Italian international players Filippo Inzaghi, Simone Inzaghi, Alberto Gilardino, as well as Alessandro Lucarelli. In 1997 the club acquired legendary hard man defender Pietro Vierchowod. Despite his advancing years, Vierchowod proved an outstanding purchase, more than holding his own in defence and even scoring decisive goals in the relegation battle. Relegation in 2000 was followed by an instant return to Serie A for two years with outstanding form shown by players like midfielder Enzo Maresca, as the club reached as high as 12th place in the 2001-02 season.

Piacenza was relegated in 2002-03, finishing in 16th position and thus returned to Serie B. The club remained in Serie B without threatening to mount a promotion challenge.

However following a poor 2010–11 Serie B season, Piacenza found themselves in a relegation playoff against Albinoleffe which they lost due to Albinoleffe&#x27;s higher league position.

==== 2012: Final bankruptcy after relegation ====

On 22 March 2012 Piacenza Calcio in strong financial difficulty was declared bankrupt by the court of Piacenza. In this season it was ranked 15th and relegated from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after play-out. On 19 June 2012 the club was finally declared bankrupt and the team was disbanded.

=== The refoundation: from Lupa Piacenza to Piacenza Calcio 1919 ===

Following the bankruptcy of Piacenza Football Club, regional amateur club &quot;A.C.D. LibertaSpes&quot;, recently promoted in the season 2011–12 to Eccellenza Emilia–Romagna after winning Promozione Emilia–Romagna Group A, was renamed to Lupa Piacenza after the obtaining the brand for four years from an association &quot;Salva Piace&quot;, in order to continue the football history of Piacenza Football Club (aka Piacenza Calcio).
In mid-2013 Lupa Piacenza was renamed Piacenza Calcio 1919. In 2013–14 Serie D season Piacenza Calcio was placed in the group B along with other team of the same city Pro Piacenza 1919 (formerly Atletico B.P. Pro Piacenza). In the 2015–16 Serie D season, Piacenza Calcio secured promotion to Lega Pro by winning the Group B title with 96 points and 30 wins over the course of the season, beating second placed Lecco by 16 points. The club didn&#x27;t manage any further promotions however, and after a few seasons in Serie C, they were relegated to Serie D in the summer of 2023.

== Stadium ==


Piacenza Calcio 1919 and Piacenza Calcio play their home matches at the 21,668-capacity Stadio Leonardo Garilli, located in the city of Piacenza.

<doc id="1136765" wikidata="Q3779598" url="?curid=1136765" title="Raoul Duke">
<text>Raoul Duke is the partially fictionalized author surrogate character and sometimes pseudonym used by Hunter S. Thompson as the main character and antihero for many of his works. He is perhaps best known as the narrator for his 1971 autobiographical novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. The book was originally written under the name Raoul Duke. The character wears a bucket hat and yellow tinted aviator sunglasses.

==In Thompson&#x27;s writings==
Duke is the main character and narrator of many of Thompson&#x27;s stories, novels, and articles, often taking part in the events of Thompson&#x27;s life in Thompson&#x27;s place. He is portrayed as a cynical, mentally unbalanced, Gonzo journalist whose daily life is a near-perpetual state of intoxication on whatever drugs happen to be availableranging from cannabis to amyl nitrite to adrenochromein an attempt to keep the spirit of the 1960s, a time which he speaks of romantically in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, alive within himself even as the rest of the country forgets it and what it represented. He usually obtains and consumes these substances in the company of his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, a &quot;half-crazed 300 pound Samoan&quot;, whose drug-induced frenzies give even Duke pause. Thompson based Gonzo on his friend Oscar Zeta Acosta.

Duke is first mentioned by Thompson in his 1966 book &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, where he is described as an outlaw who does not break the law in an offensive way to society, but a way that in fact makes him more acceptable.

Duke is often characterized as being somewhat of an author surrogate. His name, according to Thompson in interviews, was inspired by Raúl Castro and John Wayne&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Duke&quot;; however, David S. Wills, in &quot;High White Notes: The Rise and Fall of Gonzo Journalism&quot;, argues that he borrowed the name from a newspaper article during his research for &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

Duke was also used so that Thompson could talk about himselfafter a diving accident, Thompson had to spend some time in a decompression chamber, and wrote a letter signed &quot;Raoul Duke&quot; in which the pseudonym described the insanity of Thompson&#x27;s condition in the chamberholding up scrawled notes to the single glass window and ordering a television set to watch coverage of the Watergate hearings. The letter appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in August 1973.

In &quot;The Great Shark Hunt&quot; (a large selection of articles written by Thompson), Raoul Duke&#x27;s name is the one that appears on several essays that were published in newspapers and magazines, including the &quot;Police Chief&quot;, an article published by &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot; (June 1970) in which Duke is apparently an ex-police chief raging at the inadequate amount of real &quot;weaponry&quot; used by the police and advertised in the (presumably invented) &quot;Police Chief&quot; magazine. It was signed &quot;Raoul Duke (Master of Weaponry)&quot;.

In &quot;Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot;, Thompson describes Raoul Duke as a sports writer friend, one of the few journalists who can truly write objectively instead of merely talking about the concept of objectivity. In the same section, Thompson calls journalistic objectivity &quot;a pompous contradiction in terms&quot;, and warns the reader not to look for it under his byline.

Thompson is quoted in the 1978 documentary film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m never sure which one people want me to be [Thompson or Duke], and sometimes they conflict... I am living a normal life, but beside me is this myth, growing larger and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to universities to speak, I&#x27;m not sure who they&#x27;re inviting, Duke or Thompson... I suppose that my plans are to figure out some new identity, kill off one life and start another.&quot;

==Portrayals in other media==
The Duke character has been portrayed in three films:
*The 1980 film &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Bill Murray.
*The 1998 film adaptation of &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Author and character creator Hunter S. Thompson portrays an older Duke in a cameo in the Matrix flashback scene where Duke sees himself.
*The 2011 film &quot;Rango&quot;, in which Duke makes a cameo, voiced again by Johnny Depp, who also voiced the titular character of this film.

==Homages==
Garry Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Doonesbury&quot; character Uncle Duke is based on Thompson&#x27;s Raoul Duke. Although the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; character is usually referred to only as &quot;Duke&quot;, various other names for him have appeared over the years, including having the first name &quot;Raoul&quot;.

<text>The Port of Liverpool is the enclosed dock system that runs from Brunswick Dock in Liverpool to Seaforth Dock, Seaforth, on the east side of the River Mersey and the Birkenhead Docks between Birkenhead and Wallasey on the west side of the river. 

In 2023, the Port of Liverpool was the UK’s fourth busiest container port, handling around 900,000 TEUs of cargo each year, equivalent to over 30 million tonnes of freight per annum. It handles a wide variety of cargo, including containers, bulk cargoes such as coal, grain and animal feed, and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars, trucks and recycled metals. The port is also home to one of the largest cruise terminals in the UK which handles approximately 200,000 passengers and over 100 cruise ships each year.

The port has significant links to North America and the rest of Europe via the Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean. It is the most significant port in the UK for transatlantic trade. The port&#x27;s history spans over 800 years and at its peak in the 19th century, it was the second most important port in the British Empire. In 2016, the port was extended by the building of an in-river container terminal at Seaforth Dock, named Liverpool2. The terminal can berth two 14,000 container Post-Panamax ships.

Garston Docks, which are in the city of Liverpool, are not a part of the Port of Liverpool. The working docks are operated by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, the docks to the south of the Pier Head are operated by the Canal &amp; River Trust, the successor to former operator British Waterways.

==History ==
Liverpool&#x27;s first dock was the world&#x27;s first enclosed commercial dock, the Old Dock, built in 1715. The Lyver Pool, a tidal inlet in the narrows of the estuary, which is now largely under the Liverpool One shopping centre, was converted into the enclosed dock. Further docks were added and eventually all were interconnected by lock gates, extending along the Liverpool bank of the River Mersey. From 1830 onwards, most of the building stone was granite from Kirkmabreck near Creetown, Scotland.

The interconnected dock system was the most advanced port system in the world. The docks enabled ship movements within the dock system 24 hours a day, isolated from the high River Mersey tides. Parts of the system were a World Heritage Site from 2004 until 2021.

From 1885, the dock system was the hub of a hydraulic power network that stretched beyond the docks. Both White Star Line and Cunard Line were based at the port. It was also the home port of many great ships, including , , , and the ill-starred &quot;Tayleur&quot;, , , , and the .

Most of the smaller south end docks were closed in 1971 with Brunswick Dock remaining until closure in 1975. Many docks have been filled in to create land for buildings: at the Pier Head, an arena at Kings Dock, commercial estates at Toxteth and Harrington Docks and housing at Herculaneum Dock. In the north, some branch docks have been filled in to create land. Sandon and Wellington Docks have been filled in and are now the location of a sewage works. Most of Hornby Dock was filled in to allow Gladstone Dock&#x27;s coal terminal to expand.

The largest dock on the dock network, Seaforth Dock, was opened in 1972 and deals with grain and containers, accommodating what were the largest containers ships at that time. In 1972, Canadian Pacific unit CP Ships was the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool. Liverpool Freeport Zone was opened in the North Docks 1984, expanding to include some of the Birkenhead Dock system in 1992. The Euro Rail terminal was established at Seaforth Dock in 1994 and the port expanded five years later, including construction of the Liverpool Intermodal Freeport Terminal.

In 2004 UNESCO announced Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City.

==Port statistics ==
In 2020 Liverpool was the United Kingdom&#x27;s fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling 31.1 million tonnes. 
==Marina==

Liverpool Marina is in Coburg Dock and has 340 berths.

==Cruise terminal==
Cruise ships once sailed from Langton Dock, part of the enclosed north docks system. Departures and arrivals were subject to tides. Cruise ships returned to Liverpool&#x27;s Pier Head in 2008, berthing at a newly constructed cruise terminal, enabling departures and arrivals at any time. Until 2012, any cruises beginning in Liverpool still departed from Langton Dock but, since 2012, the terminal has been used as the start and end of voyages, and not merely a stop-off point. This led to a dispute with Southampton due to the large public subsidy provided for the new terminal, which Liverpool City Council has agreed to repay.
Ships which have called at Liverpool Cruise Terminal include &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (QE2), &quot;Grand Princess&quot;, &quot;Caribbean Princess&quot; and RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;. A number of large Royal Navy vessels, such as and , have also visited the terminal.

==Rail connections==

At one point the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company freight railway totalled of rail track, with connections to many other railways. A section of freight rail line ran under the Liverpool Overhead passenger railway, with trains constantly crossing the Dock Road from the docks into the freight terminals. Today, only the Canada Dock branch line is used to serve the docks, using diesel locomotives.

The first rail link to the docks was the construction of the 1830 Park Lane railway goods station opposite the Queen&#x27;s Dock in the south of the city. The terminal was accessed via the Wapping Tunnel from Edge Hill rail junction in the east of the city. The station was demolished in 1972. The tunnel is still intact.

Until 1971, Liverpool Riverside railway station served the liner terminal at the Pier Head. Today, for passengers disembarking from the new cruise terminal, city centre circular buses call at the terminal directly, while Moorfields and James Street are the nearest Merseyrail stations.

On the opposite side of the river, the Birkenhead Dock Branch served the docks between 1847 and 1993. This route remains intact, albeit disused.

<doc id="1136819" wikidata="Q4656918" url="?curid=1136819" title="A Game at Chess">
<text>A Game at Chess is a comic satirical play by Thomas Middleton, first staged in August 1624 by the King&#x27;s Men at the Globe Theatre. The play is notable for its political content, dramatizing a conflict between Spain and England.

The plot takes the form of a chess match, and the play includes some genuine chess moves. Instead of personal names, the characters are known as the White Knight, the Black King, and so forth. Yet the play unmistakably alludes to Anglo-Spanish diplomacy under King James I of England, especially the failed marriage negotiation between Prince Charles and the Spanish Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The play is satirical of King James, and it was shut down after only nine days.

==Historical context==
&quot;A Game at Chess&quot; satirises historical events and figures of the early seventeenth century. Those depicted include members of the English court, the Spanish court, and prominent religious figures. James I, who reigned as King of England and Ireland from 1603 until his death in 1625, is depicted as the White King by Middleton. His son and successor, Prince Charles or Charles I, reigned after the play was written and is depicted as the White Knight. Elizabeth of Bohemia, James I&#x27;s daughter, is also represented in the play as the White Queen. From Spain, Middleton depicts Philip IV, who reigned as King from 1621 to 1665, as the Black King. His sister Maria Anna of Spain is represented by the Black Queen. Don Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Conde de Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador who was deeply unpopular in England, is depicted as the Black Knight. Religious figures depicted include Archbishop of Split, Marco Antonio de Dominis, or the Fat Bishop, who left the Roman Catholic Church to join the Anglican Church, later returning to Rome.
The play takes place at a time of heightened tension between England and Spain, and it alludes to negotiations between the two countries to wed Prince Charles to the Spanish Infanta Maria Anna. The royal families hoped that the Spanish match would at the very least resolve some of the conflicts between England and Spain that still lingered after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Additionally, James I hoped that a marriage alliance would restore his daughter Elizabeth to the Bohemian throne. Protestant English citizens were antagonistic toward the prospect of a marriage between their prince and the Catholic Infanta. Many feared for the safety of Prince Charles and the Duke of Buckingham when they travelled to Spain in February 1623 for the negotiations, and some feared that Charles would convert to Catholicism. Charles and Buckingham, who travelled in disguise, were unprepared to negotiate effectively with the Spanish, and they agreed to Spanish terms in order to return to England unharmed. The marriage did not go ahead, and the English public largely saw Charles&#x27;s safe return and the failure of the negotiations as a victory against Spanish Catholics.

The play was stopped after nine performances (6–16 August, Sundays omitted), but not before it had become &quot;the greatest box-office hit of early modern London&quot;. The Privy Council opened a prosecution against the actors and the author of the play on 18 August, on the grounds that it was then illegal to portray any modern Christian king onstage. The Globe Theatre was shut down by the prosecution, though Middleton was able to acquit himself by showing that the play had been approved by the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert. After James I&#x27;s death, the play was printed in multiple editions, but Middleton never wrote another full play.

== Synopsis ==

=== Prologue and Induction ===
The Prologue explains that the forthcoming stage play will be based on a game of chess, with some chess pieces representing men and states.

The Ghost of Ignatius Loyola (founder of the Jesuit Order) expresses surprise at finding a rare corner of the world where his order has not been established. His servant, Error, wakes up and says that he had been dreaming of a game of chess where &quot;our side&quot;—the Black House/Catholics—was set against the White House/Protestants. Ignatius says that he wants to see the dream, so he can observe his side&#x27;s progress. The actors, as chess pieces, enter. Ignatius expresses contempt for his own followers and says that his true aim is to rule the entire world by himself.

===Act I===

The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn, a Jesuitess, launches an attempt to convert and corrupt the virginal White Queen&#x27;s Pawn. Faking tears, she says she pities the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn, who she says will be &quot;lost eternally&quot;, despite her beauty. The Jesuit Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn enters and continues the attempted conversion of the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn, but is also struck by her beauty. He encourages her to confess her sins to him. The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn confesses that she considered entering into a relationship with the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, but he was castrated by the Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn. The Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn questions the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn closely about whether she experienced sexual desire, but she insists she did not. Hoping to seduce her, he gives her a book on the virtue of obedience, and she exits.

The Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn and his castrated victim, the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, exchange insults. The Black Knight Gondomar enters and notes that the &quot;business of the universal monarchy&quot; (i.e. the goal of world dominion by the Catholic Church) is going well, primarily because of his ability to trap souls through charm and deception. The White King&#x27;s Pawn— a spy employed by the Black House— enters and issues a report. The Black Knight Gondomar calls the spy a fool after he leaves.

===Act II===

The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn enters reading the manual given to her by the Jesuit Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn. As she reads to herself, the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn enters and finds a letter addressed to him from the Black King. The Black King thanks the Jesuit for his work in corrupting the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn, but states his desire to seduce the White Queen herself. The Jesuit Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn says he will help the King, but only after he has satisfied his own desire.

The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn greets the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn and begs him to give her an order to prove her virtue through obedience. He commands her to kiss him. When she refuses, he grows insistent, then attempts to rape her. A noise from offstage provides a distraction, and the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn escapes.

Soon after, the Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn re-enters and confronts the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn about allowing the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn to get away. Then, the Black Bishop enters with the Black Knight Gondomar. The Black Bishop scolds his pawn, claiming that news of the attempted rape will cause scandal for the Black House. The Black Knight makes plans for a coverup. He orders the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn to flee and says he will falsify documents that make it look as though the pawn was not there when the incident took place. After the pawn flees through a trapdoor, the Black Knight Gondomar orders the burning of all of the pawn&#x27;s files. The files contained records of various seductions and misdeeds that would implicate the Black House if discovered. Later, the Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn enters and expresses remorse for castrating the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn.

The Fat Bishop of Spalato enters, gloating about his life. He has left the Black House and is now greatly favoured by the White House for writing books against his former faith-- but he complains the high offices he has been given are not enough. The Black Knight Gondomar and the Black Bishop enter. They curse the Fat Bishop and plot to convert him back to their side so they can take vengeance.

The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn tells the White King that the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn tried to rape her. The Black Knight Gondomar calls her a liar and produces the falsified documents. The White King finds the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn guilty of slander. He rules that the Black House may discipline her as they see fit. The Black House decree that the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn must fast for four days and kneel for twelve hours a day in a room filled with erotic images.

===Act III===

The Fat Bishop expresses dissatisfaction with the White House; he wants more titles and honours.

The Black Knight gives the Fat Bishop a (fake) letter from Rome. The letter suggests that the Fat Bishop could become the next Pope if he switches back to the Black House side. Excited by the letter, the Fat Bishop decides to burn all of the books he has written against the Black House, write a few books against the White House, and rejoin the Black House immediately.

The Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn enters and tells the Black Knight that his plot has been foiled: upon investigation, the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn discovered that the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn was, indeed, in town when the attempted rape of the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn took place. She is acquitted and released.

Angling to regain trust, the Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn praises the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn&#x27;s virtue, corroborates her account of the attempted rape, and claims responsibility for creating the distraction that enabled her escape during the attempted rape. The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn is grateful.

The Black Knight reveals that the White King&#x27;s Pawn is a spy and &quot;captures&quot; him.

The Fat Bishop reveals his change to the Black side and says he will immediately begin writing books against the White House. In an aside, the Black Knight says he will flatter the Fat Bishop for a while and betray him as soon as he outlives his usefulness.

The (recently captured) White King&#x27;s Pawn asks the Black Knight how he will be rewarded for his service. Gondomar answers by sending him to &quot;the bag&quot; (a giant onstage bag for captured chess pieces, symbolic of Hell).

The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn tells the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn that she has seen her future husband in a magic Egyptian mirror. The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn is intrigued.

In a comic interlude full of sexual innuendo, a Black Jesting Pawn is taken from behind by a White Pawn, who is in turn taken from behind by another Black Pawn. 

The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn takes the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn to a room where the magic Egyptian mirror is kept. The Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn enters, disguised as the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn&#x27;s rich future husband (the scene is arranged so that the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn is only able to see the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn in the mirror). The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn is fooled by the ruse.

===Act IV===

The Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn still feels guilty for castrating the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, so he asks the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn for absolution. The Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn says he cannot absolve that sin; he must apply to the Fat Bishop himself.

The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn enters with the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn. They notice the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, who is still disguised as the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn&#x27;s rich future husband, so the Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn takes him offstage to the magic mirror to see if it is a match. When they return, the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn swears he saw an image of the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn when he looked in the mirror and suggests that they have sex that very night. The White Virgin protests that she cannot have sex until they are properly married. The Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn is frustrated, but the Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn tells him not to worry—she will manage everything.

The Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn begs the Fat Bishop for absolution. The Fat Bishop and the Black Knight look through the official book of penances (and financial prices) for the pardoning of sins, but they cannot find an entry for having gelded another man. The Fat Bishop comments that it would be easier to pardon the Pawn for murder than for castration. The distressed Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn finds a way out of his dilemma: he will kill the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn so that he can then be forgiven.

The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn orchestrates a &quot;bed trick&quot;; in a dark room, she tricks the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn into having sex with her by leading him to believe that he is going to bed with the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn. The White Queen&#x27;s Pawn remains safely unmolested.

The White Knight and the White Duke travel to the Black House, pretending to be interested in converting. The Black Knight welcomes the two and tells the White Knight that he will do anything to please him. The Fat Bishop attempts to capture the unprotected White Queen, but his attack is prevented by the White Bishop and the White King, who capture the Fat Bishop and send him to &quot;the bag&quot;.

===Act V===

The White Knight and the White Duke enter the Black court, which is decorated with statues and candles. To entertain the honoured guests, a Latin oration is spoken and a song is sung during which the statues seem to move by themselves and the candles light themselves.

The Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn— no longer in his &quot;rich future husband&quot; disguise— tells the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn mockingly that he is the man with whom she has spent the night. The White Virgin insists that she spent the night alone. The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn enters and reveals her bed trick: that it was she with whom the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn spent the night. The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn reveals that in the past, she was sexually abused by the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, and that she has done all this to orchestrate his capture. She knows she will be captured too, but she doesn&#x27;t care. The White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn and the White Queen capture the Black Bishop&#x27;s Pawn and the Jesuitess Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn and send them to the bag.

The Black Knight&#x27;s Pawn tries to murder the White Bishop&#x27;s Pawn, but his attempt is foiled by the White Queen&#x27;s Pawn. She captures him and sends him to the bag, then leaves, resolved to live a single and celibate life.

The White Knight and the White Duke have just finished a decadent meal at the Black court. The Black Knight delivers a long speech boasting about the extravagance of their mode of life.

The White Knight implies that he is interested in changing sides, but worries that his sins would transgress the Black House&#x27;s rules. The Black Knight encourages the White Knight to confess his sins. The White Knight confesses to being ambitious; the Black Knight counters that the Black House loves ambition since they desire to rule the world. The White Knight confesses to being covetous; the Black Knight tells him their whole institution is built on financial gain. The White Duke confesses to being lecherous; the Black Knight says that is commonplace within the Black House too. Lastly, the White Knight confesses to being &quot;an arch-dissembler&quot;. The Black Knight, King and Queen call him their brother and proclaim that everything they do is falsehood. As soon as these crimes have been admitted, the White Knight gives them &quot;checkmate by discovery... the noblest mate of all.&quot; Thus, the game is won. The White King appears with the rest of the White House court; all of the remaining Black House pieces are sent to the bag.

==Texts==
&quot;A Game at Chess&quot; survives in nine different texts, each of which has its own unique characteristics. Gary Taylor thus calls the play &quot;the most complicated editorial problem in the entire corpus of early modern drama, and one of the most complicated in English literature&quot;. The play is unique in that it exists in more 17th-century manuscripts than it does printed editions (six extant manuscripts compared to three printed editions). Of the manuscripts, one is an authorial holograph, and three are the work of Ralph Crane, a professional scribe who worked for the King&#x27;s Men in this era and who is thought to have prepared some of the play texts for the First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

The manuscript and printed forms of the text present significant orthographical differences as well as some differences in the plot and characters&#x27; names. For example, early manuscript forms of the play lack the Prologue and use ambiguous speech prefixes, referring to characters by the initials of their chess pieces rather than by name.

There are two major studies of the relationship between the texts: that of T. H. Howard Hill (1995), and Gary Taylor (2007); the studies give different names to the texts.

== Criticism and interpretation ==

=== Politics and religion ===
Much of the criticism and interpretation of &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; has focused on its political, religious and allegorical content. Scholars agree that Middleton antagonizes Spanish Catholics and the Jesuit order by portraying them as schemers intent on the domination of the world. The Black Queen&#x27;s Pawn serves as an example, representing a domestic threat to English women, especially virgins. Overall, Middleton uses black and white imagery to portray Spanish Catholics as evil (&quot;black&quot;) in their ambitions to convert the pure English nation (&quot;white&quot;) to Catholicism.

Thomas Cogswell has argued that the play enjoyed success not only because of its humorous and critical portrayal of Spain, but also because it celebrates the Duke of Buckingham and Prince Charles as heroes. Cogswell argues that Middleton does not advance the agenda of his patron, the Earl of Pembroke, by criticizing Buckingham. Instead, the play was an attempt to reinforce public support for Charles and Buckingham.

Howard Hill has suggested that the play is not a result of any specific statecraft, but merely takes advantage of the anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiments of the time. However, other scholars see the play as participating in the agenda of Parliamentary Puritans and their Continental counterparts, mainly the Dutch, to galvanize the masses against the Spanish-Catholic hegemony. Gary Taylor has argued that the play was subversive insofar as Middleton&#x27;s Puritan ideology was in opposition to the Church of England and also the political establishment, specifically King James I of England. For Taylor, the play was meant to be a pointed critique of Catholic ideals and its authoritative control over its subjects&#x27; lives. Yet Taylor also argues that the text &quot;depends upon what it rejects&quot;, that is, &quot;obedience, confession, dissembling, totalizing power, and sexual mismatching&quot;.

=== Chess allegory ===
Roussel Sargent has argued that Middleton uses chess allegory to elude censorship, allowing him to avoid explicitly identifying his characters with political figures. Portraying the events of the play as a chess match affords Middleton flexibility: he can create completely fictitious characters, and he can also base characters upon political figures. Chess is also a means of portraying the conflicts between Catholic Spain and Protestant England in terms of two clearly opposing sides.

Scholars have claimed that Middleton&#x27;s chess allegory also has a racist aspect, in that the difference between England and Spain in cast in terms of skin color. The blackness of the Spanish side associates darker complexion with evil, while the whiteness of England associates lighter complexion with purity.

=== Influence on the public ===
Musa Gurnis has observed that scholars have neglected to observe the impact of the play&#x27;s dramaturgy upon audiences. Gurnis argues that the play not only arouses anti-Catholic sentiment, but also encourages the audience to actively persecute Catholic minorities outside of the theatre. Stephen Wittek notes that plays including &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; shaped and contributed to the making of a public sphere, as audience members were able to bond over shared experiences and partake in a shared discourse.

<text>L.R. Vicenza S.p.A. (acronym for &quot;Lanerossi Vicenza&quot;), better known as Vicenza, is an Italian football club based in the city of Vicenza. It plays in Serie C, the third division of the Italian football league.

Founded on 9 March 1902, as &quot;Associazione del Calcio in Vicenza&quot;, it is the oldest football club in north-eastern Italy as well as in the Triveneto and Veneto regions. It has played 30 Serie A championships (20 of which were consecutive between 1955–1956 and 1974–1975): it therefore occupies &quot;19th place in the ranking of teams with the best sporting tradition&quot; of clubs that have played in Italy&#x27;s top league while placing in &quot;18th place in the perpetual ranking&quot;. The IFFHS lists it among the 15 best Italian teams of the 20th century.

Domestically it boasts the victory of an Italian Cup (1996–1997) and of the Italian Cup Serie C in 1981–1982 and 2022–2023, while the best result at international level is reaching the semi-final of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (1997–1998); it also counts reaching the final in the 1910–1911 First Division championship, where it was defeated by Pro Vercelli, and a second place behind Juventus in the 1977–1978 Serie A championship, in which it achieved the best result ever by a newly promoted club in the &quot;single-round&quot; era .

The club was reformed in 2018, following Vicenza Calcio&#x27;s bankruptcy, thanks to the moving and name change of &quot;Bassano Virtus&quot; (then owned by OTB Group) from Bassano to Vicenza. L.R Vicenza is now the heir, and &quot;de facto&quot; continuation, of the sporting tradition that began on 9 March 1902 with the founding of &quot;Associazione del Calcio in Vicenza&quot; which later became &quot;Lanerossi Vicenza&quot; from 1953 to 1989 and finally &quot;Vicenza Calcio&quot;, before going bankrupt in 2018.

==History==
Vicenza, founded in 1902 by a group of citizens led by Professor Tito Buy, headmaster of the Lioy High School, and by physical education teacher Antonio Libero Scarpa, it is one of the oldest football clubs in Italy. The formation of the first board of directors took place on 9 March 1902, while the competitive debut took place on 18 May 1903 in a friendly match valid for the Provincial Championship for Schools.

The professional debut dates back to the 1910–11 season: ACIVI (as Vicenza was called for its first fifty years, acronym of &quot;Associazione del Calcio in Vicenza&quot;) inaugurated its new Borgo Casale ground on 12 February 1911 with a great victory over Bologna and in March finished the Veneto-Emilia round with a full score, qualifying for the final for the title. However, it had to succumb, both away and at home, to Pro Vercelli which was in its golden years.

Vicenza challenged Pro Vercelli in the double final of the 1910–1911 First Category championship.

In the years before the First World War it took part to several national finals of northern Italy, which were played between the winners of the regional groups. Vicenza thus met Bologna, Juventus, Milan and Inter several times, establishing itself among the best Italian teams.

Vicenza began in the First Category in the 1920s competing in various regional groups. In 1921-22 it joined the &quot;schism of&quot; the great teams, going to play in the C.C.I. championship: it finished last in group A, a result that condemned it to having to play and win the inter-divisional qualifiers against teams from the Second Division to escape relegation. When the Compromesso Colombo was implemented, it faced the inter-divisional qualification round which it lost against Derthona, thus leaving the top national division. In the 1924–25 season Vicenza won the elimination round of the Second Division after play-offs with Udinese and Olympia Fiume, but was then disqualified and downgraded to last place due to the irregular positions of the Hungarians Horváth and Molnár; however, it was not relegated because thanks to the Italian Football Federation. Unprepared for the transformations that were launching Italian football towards professionalism, it was overwhelmed by the various tournament restructurings, leading to the 1929 plummeting to the fourth level of the national football pyramid.

=== Romeo Menti ===
The 1930s were years of redemption for the biancorossi, after a decade to forget. In 1932–1933 the team was promoted to Serie B, where it remained for two seasons, while trying again and again to gain promotion to Serie A. In that period the &quot;biancorossi&quot; churned out talents of the calibre of the Umberto brothers and above all Romeo Menti, captain &quot;Neno&quot; Rossi, Bruno Camolese, Luigi Chiodi, Giovanni Costa, and the star Piero Spinato, the club&#x27;s top scorer to this day. In the 1939–1940 season promotion to Serie B arrived with a clear advantage over the second team. On 8 September 1935 a new stadium along the Bacchiglione river had been inaugurated, leaving the Borgo Casale pitch, the inaugural match was against the Hungarian team Soroksár with a 16-year-old Romeo Menti making his professional debut. After his death during the 1949 Superga air disaster, the stadium in Vicenza would be named in his honor.

At the beginning of the 1940s Vicenza conquered the top national division, thanks also to a midfield that went down in history as one of the best of the era formed by: Osvaldo Fattori (later at Inter), Alfonso Santagiuliana (who also played for Grande Torino) and Luigi Abeni (whose career was cut short by illness).

=== Serie A 1942–1943: the Vicenza eleven in Juventus-Vicenza 2–6 ===
Vicenza&#x27;s Serie A 1942–1943 season ended with a historic escape from relegation, won on the last day by defeating Juventus 6–2 in Turin on Easter Sunday 1943. After 8 September they took part in the Veneto round of the 1944 War championship, but renounced the national finals. After the Second World War, Vicenza returned to play in Serie A, after the mixed championship of 1946. In the 1946–1947 Serie A, when the single-round championship returned, Vicenza surprisingly placed fifth (the team&#x27;s best scorer was Bruno Quaresima from Vicenza); the following year, however, the team finished last (the only time in the history that Vicenza ended at the bottom of the table) and was relegated. In 1949 Vicenza came close to an immediate return to Serie A, but it slipped away by one point. This was followed by several seasons in Serie B in which it placed in mid-table, and which were characterised by economic problems.

=== Lanerossi Vicenza ===
On 26 June 1953 an event occurred that would change the history of the Vicenza club for many decades: the old ACIVI was bought by the Schio-based wool producing giant, Lanerossi, founded in the 19th century by Alessandro Rossi. This was not the first case of football sponsorship in Italy, which was still forbidden at the time, but instead a so-called coupling, i.e. a real takeover: the football club became a rib of the textile company, even carrying its name and symbol - the R - on its shirts (sponsorship would only be allowed in the early 1980s). The logo remained on the red and white shirts until the 1988–1989 season, but has made a return since the 2000s as it has become a de facto symbol of the Vicenza football club even following the company&#x27;s departure.

Luís Vinício and Giulio Savoini, were Lanerossi&#x27;s &quot;flag-bearers&quot; in the early 50s two players who would go down in history as some of the club&#x27;s best.

=== The golden twenty years in Serie A (1955–1975) ===
The injection of confidence and, above all, cash allowed Vicenza to set up a team that soon, after a season of adjustment, returned to Serie A in 1955 after seven seasons, with coach Aldo Campatelli and many goals from Enrico Motta. On their return to the top division Vicenza achieved a surprising escape from relegation with a ninth-place finish. The glory of the first team was complemented by winning the famous Viareggio tournament in 1954 and 1955, twice in a row. From the Viareggio team came players such as Azeglio Vicini, Sergio Campana, Renzo Cappellaro, Mario David, Mirko Pavinato, Luigi Menti and many others who later wore the biancorossa shirt in Serie A. In the second half of the 1950s, the offensive department was strengthened with the addition of two South Americans, first Américo Murolo and, in the following season, Francisco Lojacono, as well as the Vicenza-born Renzo Cappellaro.

At the turn of the decade Vicenza placed with two consecutive seventh places, and in 1960–1961 the coach Roberto Lerici (a former biancorosso player in the 1950s) won the Seminatore d&#x27;oro award for best coach of the season. Lanerossi maintained its characteristics of a provincial club, careful about budgets, that valorised young players, produced from its youth sector or coming from other teams, maintaining a strong nucleus of flagship players, and occasionally welcoming great players at the end of their careers, such as Giovan Battista Fabbri and Paolo Rossi, respectively coach and striker of Lanerossi in the second half of the 1970s.

In 1962, the arrival of 30-year-old Brazilian centre forward Luís Vinício brought further lustre to the team. In the 1963–1964 Serie A season Vicenza rose to first place in the league table for three consecutive matches, taking sixth place at the end of the championship. Luis Vinicio in the 1965–1966 season, his best season, was the league&#x27;s top scorer&#x27;s with 25 goals (it would take twenty-six years for a Serie A player to score that many: it would be Marco van Basten in 1991–1992). Lanerossi finished that season fifth.

However, great results were followed by years in which relegation was risked, often escaping it on the last match day. Among the most risky escapes from relegation, a historic one was that of 1972–1973, in which Lanerossi seemed doomed, but with three victories in the last three match days managed to climb the slope up to play a relegation match against Atalanta, winning it thanks to an own goal by Atalanta. Luck deserted Lanerossi in 1975 when, in their 20th consecutive Serie A championship, they were relegated to Serie B.

After an opaque 1975–76 season in which they even risked relegation to Serie C, Lanerossi went into the 1976–77 season with little hope. However, the new coach, Giovan Battista Fabbri had an intuition: he transformed the young Paolo Rossi (who lead the Italian National Football Team to winning the 1982 Fifa World Cup and during which he won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball, in the same season he was also awarded the Balon d&#x27;Or) from a right winger with poor prospects into an excellent centre forward, leading Vicenza to promotion to Serie A. After a hesitant start, the red and whites proved to be overwhelming, thanks to Rossi&#x27;s goals, the safety of libero Giorgio Carrera, the plays of Franco Cerilli and Giancarlo Salvi, Mario Guidetti in midfield, and the unstoppable Roberto Filippi.

=== Real Vicenza 1977–78 season: newly promoted and runners-up in Serie A ===
Only Juventus did better than Lanerossi. The team finished the championship in 2nd place and made it to the UEFA Cup: it is still the best ever result by a newly promoted team in the history of the Italian top division. Paolo Rossi became the new phenomenon of Italian football: in December 1977 he was called up for the national team and at the end of the season he won the title of top scorer with 24 goals, a significant figure for a 16-team tournament. In June 1978 Rossi was part of the Italian team at the World Cup in Argentina, where the Azzurri finished fourth and the centre forward scored three goals.

On his return to Italy, the agreement of the player&#x27;s co-ownership with Juventus had to be addressed, in retrospect a fundamental crossroads in the Biancorossi&#x27;s future at the end of the 1970s. The deal was only resolved at the trade deadline, with record sums never committed before in a single football market session: Farina offered as much as 2,612,510,000 lire to secure the other half of Pablito&#x27;s card. The considerable sums proved problematic for Vicenza&#x27;s shrunken coffers, who were now forced to sell some of Fabbri&#x27;s other best elements in order to recoup their investment in &quot;Mr. Five Billion&quot; Rossi, as well as facing discontent from the rest of the squad due to the different economic treatment reserved for them. In this difficult context, Farina&#x27;s plans failed in the short space of a season: in its European debut, the team was eliminated in the first round of the 1978–1979 UEFA Cup by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Dukla Praga, while in Serie A, after never having found a real rhythm of play, it slowly slipped to the bottom of the table to an unthinkable relegation. Lanerossi thus found themselves in Serie B and, two years later, even in C1; meagre consolation was the winning, in the 1981–1982 season, of the Coppa Italia of Serie C.

A young Roberto Baggio, born and raised in the province of Vicenza, made his professional football debut with Vicenza in the 1984–1985 championship after years in their youth sector. He would later become one of the best Italian football players in history.

On 16 June 1985, even with the young star Roberto Baggio absent due to injury, on the neutral pitch of the Franchi in Florence, Vicenza, led by coach Bruno Giorgi, returned to Serie B after winning the promotion play-offs against Piacenza. The following season, it gained a third place in Serie B seemily reopening the doors of Serie A for Vicenza, however, the CAF annulled the club&#x27;s promotion due to the club&#x27;s involvement in a betting scandal: the blow was so strong for the Vicenza that in 1987 they fell back into Serie C1.

=== Vicenza Calcio ===
In the summer of 1989 the club, taken over by Pieraldo Dalle Carbonare, changed its name, bidding farewell to Lanerossi and its R, and becoming Vicenza Calcio. In the 1989–1990 season the team risked relegation to Serie C2, in a troubled year marked by three coaching changes. On 7 June 1990 Vicenza, led by &quot;flag-bearer&quot; Giulio Savoini, escaped relegation in a play-off match against Prato on the neutral pitch of the Mazza stadium in Ferrara, with the support of an exodus of &quot;biancorossi&quot; fans who invaded the Estense city. In 1990–1991 coach Giuseppe Caramanno was exonerated and Antonio Pasinato took over, but not even he managed to get Vicenza back into Serie B, a goal achieved two seasons later with Renzo Ulivieri. In 1993–1994, the Tuscan coach, despite not having any great strikers, managed to save Vicenza with a choral game that was to be the team&#x27;s hallmark throughout that period. Even his successor, Francesco Guidolin, adopted a strategy aimed at emphasising the skills of the group and the play of the whole team rather than that of individual players. The following year, the performances of captain Giovanni Lopez, full-back Gilberto D&#x27;Ignazio Pulpito and centre-back Domenico Di Carlo brought Vicenza back to the top flight, where they finished ninth.

=== Winning of the 1996–97 Coppa Italia ===
On Thursday 29 May 1997 Vicenza celebrated a historic victory of the 1996–97 Coppa Italia.

After a very positive Serie A season, in which Vicenza were able to achieve memorable victories against the &quot;big three&quot; Juventus, Inter and Milan, as well as being the league leaders for several weeks, the team &quot;catalysed national interest&quot; thanks to it being a revelation in the Coppa Italia, culminating in the final against Napoli: in the first leg, played at the San Paolo, the &quot;biancorossi&quot; lost 1–0, but in the return match, on 29 May 1997 at the Romeo Menti Stadium in Vicenza, Giampiero Maini immediately levelled the score; it then went into extra time where Maurizio Rossi and Alessandro Iannuzzi scored the historic goals at the end of the match sealing a 3–0 final score and winning Vicenza the most important trophy in its history.

=== English ownership and UEFA Cup ===
In the summer of 1997, the ENIC Group (English National Investment Company) owned by Joe Lewis, took over the majority of the red and white club: Vicenza thus became the first Italian team to have foreign ownership. As &quot;holders of the Coppa Italia&quot;, the &quot;biancorossi&quot; earned the right to play in the Italian Super Cup, which they lost to Juventus on 23 August 1997 at the Stadio delle Alpi in Turin. In the 1997–1998 season, after their eighth-place finish the year before, Vicenza saved themselves from relegation without any problems, but let themselves down a little in the Serie A, distracted by their commitment in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup where, on the contrary, they surprised by &quot;reaching the semi-finals&quot;, losing only to Chelsea, who would later win the competition. Decisive in the European competition was the contribution of Pasquale Luiso, who would win top scorer of the cup.

With Guidolin&#x27;s farewell, the following year marked the end of a cycle, with a relegation to Serie B followed by immediate promotion back to the top league thanks to their win of the 1999–2000 Serie B championship, with coach Edoardo Rejaon and a prolific striker group in which Gianni Comandini, the usual Pasquale Luiso and the young Cristian Bucchi stood out. Their stay in Serie A lasted only a year, however, as the 2000–2001 season ended with relegation, this would be Vicenza&#x27;s last season in Italy&#x27;s top league.

=== Downfall ===
In December 2004 the club returned into the hands of local entrepreneurs when Sergio Cassingena became president. From this moment on, Vicenza&#x27;s history saw a decade in Serie B made up of last-minute escapes from relegations and three relegations to Serie C, two of which, in 2005 and 2012, were later annulled due to sporting offences committed by other teams.

In 2013 this relatively successful decade ended with the definitive downgrading to Italy&#x27;s third league due to cyclical financial problems, which led to a heavy deficit for the club. During the years in Serie C Vicenza was coached by the former &quot;biancorosso&quot; captain Giovanni Lopez. At the end of the 2013–2014 championship Vicenza lost the play-out against Savona to stay in Serie B, but was reinstated in Serie B as replacement for the bankrupt Siena. In the 2014–2015 Serie B the team rose to third place almost reaching Serie A, but fatally losing the play-offs against Pescara.

In 2017, the &quot;biancorossi&quot;, were taken over by a new group of businessmen from Vicenza, relegated to Serie C, a fact that further exacerbated the club&#x27;s economic crisis.

=== 2018: Bankruptcy and re-foundation ===
Declared bankrupt and placed on temporary administration, in 2018 Vicenza even risked relegation to Serie D, but managed to save itself by winning the relegation matches against Santarcangelo. Having definitively ceased activities, the club&#x27;s sporting title was withdrawn by the Italian Football Federation.

At the end of the season, entrepreneur Renzo Rosso (president of the OTB Group and founder of Diesel) bought the corporate branch of Vicenza Calcio and assigning it to another football team he owned, Virtus Bassano, which, thanks to a federal procedure, moved from Bassano del Grappa to Vicenza and changed its name to &quot;L.R.&quot; &quot;Vicenza Virtus&quot;, becoming the de facto heir of the historical Vicenza football tradition. Vicenza could thus remained in Serie C and enrolled in the 2018–2019 championship using the Bassano&#x27;s sporting roster. The first year of Rosso&#x27;s management ended with the qualification to the first round of the play-offs, played in Ravenna ending with a 1-1: this meant the elimination of the Vicentini due to the worst placement in the standings.

The 2019–2020 regular season, under the guidance of coach Domenico Di Carlo, a former biancorosso player, due to the early suspension of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vicenza was declared the winner of the Serie C division B (being first before the season ending) by the Federal Council of the Italian Football Federation, marking the official promotion of the club to Serie B.

The 2020–2021 season saw the &quot;biancorossi&quot; achieve an easy escape from relegation to Serie C; meanwhile, on 9 February 2021, the shareholders&#x27; meeting approved the change of the club&#x27;s name to &quot;L.R. Vicenza.&quot;

In the 2021–2022 season, Vicenza found themselves at the back of the table, the season showed disagreements between the fan groups and the club, with the supporters expressing their disappointment for the lack of results and the absence of dialogue, while the management repeatedly retaliated harshly to them, pointing out the considerable investments made. Vicenza managed to avert direct relegation only on the last day of the regular season, but the descent to Serie C was finally sanctioned by a play-out loss against Cosenza.

The following season in Serie C the team performed below expectations, suffering many defeats that finally deprived them of the chance to fight for direct promotion; at the same time, however, on 12 April Vicenza won the 50th edition of the Coppa Italia Serie C against Juventus Next Gen.

The 2023/2024 season opened with new Coach Aimo Diana at the helm of the red and white team; after a first half of the season which was extremely below expectations, the exit from the Coppa Italia of Serie C against Rimini and a fan base in full protest, the arrival of Coach Stefano Vecchi on the bench changed things, with a record 23 consecutive useful results. The streak was interrupted by the defeat in the play-off final against Carrarese missing a Serie B promotion yet again.

== Colors and symbols ==
Since 1902, Vicenza&#x27;s club colours have been &quot;white and red&quot;, the same colours of the city&#x27;s emblem. The uniform used by the team in its home matches has traditionally consisted of a red and white jersey, combined with white shorts and socks, the latter with red tips.

Over the course of the club&#x27;s history, the Vicenza uniform has undergone various changes. Initially, it was basically a shirt with very narrow lines, combined with red socks. Between the 1920s and 1930s, in addition to the aforementioned shirt, white shirts with a red horizontal band in the centre of the chest, or conversely red with a white central band, were also in use, together with red shorts; the central band would be eliminated in the following decade, leaving the uniform completely white. After the World War II, the Vicenza team often sported a wider palette than at the beginning of the 20th century.

Between the years 1963–1964 and 1966–1967 there was then a return to a jersey with very thick posts; in the last season a white jersey with a red diagonal bar was also worn. From the 1970s, the vertical posts returned to a standard width; with the end of the decade, Lanificio Rossi began to provide as second and third jerseys models with bright colours, including green, light blue, blue and yellow, very simple and minimal, marked only by the company&#x27;s classic &quot;R&quot; affixed to the chest.

In the 1981–1982 season, the first official sponsor appeared on the red and white jerseys: Yuma Jeans, which remained there until the 1983–1984 season.

Until the 1995–1996 season, the jersey featured thicker lines; while from the 1996–1997 season to the 1998–1999 season the uniform appeared with fewer lines.

From the introduction of surnames (1995–1996 season) until the 2006–2007 season, the numbers and surnames in the club&#x27;s home jerseys were black. Other colours of the numbers and surnames were red (season 2007–2008), white (seasons 2008–2009, 2013–2014, 2014–2015, 2015–2016 and 2016–2017), light blue (vintages 2010–2011 and 2017–2018) and gold (season 2011–2012).

In the 2012–2013 season, the fluorescent green second uniform was also sometimes used as the goalkeepers&#x27; uniform.

As far as stylistic variations, in the dark third jerseys produced by Biemme and Lotto, used in the mid-1990s, the two-tone collar of white and red was notable.

In the 1996–1997 Serie A, goalkeeper Luca Mondini, being a rugby enthusiast, agreed with technical supplier Biemme, in wearing several extravagant customised jerseys with bichromatic horizontal stripes (green-and-white, yellow-and-yellow, blue-orange and red-and-white).

The 2001–2002 season was a celebration of Vicenza&#x27;s hundred years since. To celebrate the centenary, Umbro developed a classic jersey: it featured the historic and iconic &quot;R&quot; on the left, and a mutation of the &quot;V&quot; logo, which became golden for that season and was placed in the centre of the jersey.

On the subject of jerseys, it remains curious what happened on 4 October 2008 at the &quot;Omobono Tenni Stadium&quot; in Treviso: the match Cittadella- Vicenza started with several minutes of delay because the referee Riccardo Tozzi made the Vicenza players change their jersey, chromatically similar to that of Cittadella, so the warehouseman of Vicenza ran to buy phosphorescent yellow jerseys in a shop in Treviso outside the stadium, with the inconvenience of the wrong numbering that did not correspond to the real number of Vicenza players, in addition to the lack of the surnames written on the back.

In the 2016–2017 season on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the winning of the 1996–1997 Coppa Italia, a celebratory coat of arms was featured on Vicenza&#x27;s jersey to commemorate the historic victory of the tricolour cockade.

Starting from the 2020–2021 season on the back of the shirts, above the surnames sits Vicenza&#x27;s provincial coat of arms, inside which the four military shrines of the First World War which Vicenza hots (the Ossario del Pasubio, the Ossario del Cimone, the Ossario di Asiago and the Ossario del Grappa) are depicted in the four corners, while in the centre there&#x27;s a golden pole surmounted by the city coat of arms consisting of the silver-plated white cross on a red background.

In the history of Vicenza, because of the prestigious goals achieved by these team, the two most iconic jerseys remain those of &quot;Real Vicenza&quot;, which came close to winning the Serie A in the 1977–1978 season, and that of Francesco Guidolin&#x27;s &quot;Vicenza of miracles&quot; in the mid-1990s with sponsor Pal Zileri.

=== Official symbols ===
==== Badge ====
From 1902, the year of its foundation, to the 1952–1953 season, the club used as its symbol a Swiss shield on left with a white cross on a red field (borrowed from the heraldic coat of arms of the city of Vicenza), right palato in white and red. The cuspidal band, on a white background, bore the inscription A.C. VICENZA in red letters.

In the 1953–1954 season (following the acquisition from Lanerossi) a truncated ancile took its place: in the upper field, on a white background, was inscribed the changed company name LANEROSSI A.C. VICENZA (in gold letters), while in the lower field, on a white and red palate background, stood out the famous knotted &quot;R&quot; (in gold), symbol of the Schio textile company.

A true protagonist of the company the &quot;R of&quot; Lanerossi remained the only crest on the team&#x27;s jerseys until the 1988–1989 season.

In 1989, following the end of the &quot;Lanerossi season&quot; and the change of name to &quot;Vicenza Calcio&quot;, the artist Antonio &quot;Toni&quot; Vedù of Anonima Magnagati designed a new crest: it was basically a modern white French shield bordered in red, almost completely occupied by a large red &quot;V&quot; with a white stripe inside, which on the left changed to a cross (evoking the town&#x27;s heraldry). At the top was the inscription VICENZA CALCIO 1902, in red letters.

Following an agreement with the Marzotto group (which had become the owner of Lanerossi), in the 2001–2002 season (to coincide with the centenary of the club&#x27;s foundation) the &quot;R of&quot; Lanerossi returned on the red and white uniforms. Following the renewal of the agreement, from the 2006–2007 season it returned to being an integral part of the Vicenza jerseys, becoming a sort of &quot;secondary crest&quot;.

In 2018, following the bankruptcy of &quot;Vicenza Calcio&quot;, the team&#x27;s successor, Renzo Rosso and OTB&#x27;s &quot;L.R. Vicenza Virtus&quot; chose to discontinue the 1989 emblem in favour of leaving only the &quot;R&quot;, which thus returned to being the actual team crest. A new emblem was thus conceived (used solely for administrative and communication purposes, and not on the jerseys), in which the Lanerossi symbol is inserted in a circle, below it stands the writing L.R. VICENZA 1902, in black.

==== Anthem ====
The club&#x27;s official anthem is the &quot;Inno biancorosso&quot;, the main and historical anthem of the fans. It is the oldest and dates back to the early 1960s. It was created at the request of the Lanerossi owners who, after being the first Italian company to buy a Serie A football team, wanted to leave a further mark on Vicenza&#x27;s football history. This anthem is still sung at the stadium today (albeit some adaptations made by the fans). In 2018, following the club&#x27;s re-foundation, this anthem became the official anthem again, being performed at home matches.

In addition to this there are several other songs:

* &quot;Grande Vicenza 1902–1992 90&quot; anni, anthem composed in 1992 on the occasion of Vicenza&#x27;s 90 years of history;
* &quot;Cuore biancorosso&quot;, an anthem recorded for charity purposes sung in 1997 by coach Francesco Guidolin and the biancorossi players, to celebrate the victory of the 1996–1997 Coppa Italia;
* &quot;Fedeli alla tribù&quot;, a song written by the Vicenza punk rock band Derozer in honour of Vicenza&#x27;s away match at Stamford Bridge in London against Chelsea in the semi-final of the 1997–1998 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup;
* &quot;Forza Vicenza avanti Vicenza forza Vicenza campione Vicenza&quot;, an anthem composed in recent years by Argentine biancorosso fan Miguel Angel Regalado;
* &quot;Vicenza cuore biancorosso&quot;, an anthem composed by DJ Manuel Negrin in 2012 and sung by Luca Menti; the title was chosen through a poll on the official website of Vicenza Calcio, being played in the 2010s during the entrance of the biancorossi players onto the pitch at the Menti stadium and at the end of matches.

==== Mascot ====
Vicenza has its own official mascot: &quot;Gatton Gattoni&quot;. Its history began during the 1994–1995 Serie B championship when a Vicenza advertising agency decided to create an image to associate with the football team: the idea was to choose a comic character who could sum up a representative image for the people of Vicenza together with the white and red colours.

A cat was chosen, personified in a player wearing a Vicenza shirt. At the end of the championship Vicenza was promoted to Serie A and for this reason Gatton Gattoni immediately became the lucky charm of the team and the fans. If at first the agency chose to give the mascot an exclusively papery guise (he appeared in the team&#x27;s newspaper and on the fans&#x27; flyers) and poster art, they finally came up with the creation of a two and a half metre tall mascot that entertained the spectators by walking around the playing field at every match. Gatton Gattoni physically took the field on 12 May 1996, during the last championship match, when Vicenza drew 2–2 at home against Sampdoria. Shortly afterwards, every Vicenza Calcio initiative was attended by the official mascot. Gatton Gattoni also became a merchandising product line for Vicenza Calcio. His popularity in the world of football is now national as well as being the first example of an official mascot of a Serie A club. The mascot&#x27;s presence during matches and official events continued until 2018 when Vicenza Calcio went bankrupt.

== Stadium and training facilities ==
The first stadium in which the then A.C. Vicenza played was the &quot;Borgo Casale field&quot; in the eastern part of the city. It was a simple football field without stands or bleachers where the biancorossi players took their first steps. The interruption due to the First World War led the club to look for a new area where they could play their matches.

In 1919, a new stadium was built in San Felice (west of the Vicenza), which, for the time, was a modern sports facility with a wooden grandstand and changing rooms. During the 1920s, the grandstand was then built in concrete and the changing rooms were moved to the space below. It was inaugurated on Sunday 22 June 1919 with the friendly match Vicenza - Triestina. It was nicknamed &quot;stadio dea carbonea&quot; (charcoal stadium) because, in order to level out the grooves left by the iron studs, they used to cover them with charcoal and pyrite taken from the nearby foundries.

Since 1935, the team has played its home matches at the Romeo Menti stadium, which has always been municipal property.

The stadium was initially called &quot;Campo Sportivo del Littorio&quot;, in line with the fascist influences of the time. Inaugurated on the city&#x27;s patron saint&#x27;s day on 8 September with a match between Vicenza and Soroksár of Budapest, it was subsequently damaged by bombings during the Second World War, renovated in a few months (with the elimination of the athletics track) and renamed, in 1946, to &quot;Municipal&quot;.

After the Superga air disaster in which Romeo Menti, born in Vicenza and a former Vicenza footballer, lost his life, the city decided, in 1949, to name the stadium after him.

It has undergone several renovations and adaptations over the years. It is a typical &quot;English-style&quot; stadium, with stands and bleachers very close to the pitch. While reaching highs of hosting 30,000 specators in the 1970s it currently holds a maximum of 12,000 specators.

=== Training centre ===
From 2006 to 2017, the club used a modern technical centre, located in Isola Vicentina, called the Centro Tecnico Piermario Morosini.

The structure was developed over a total area of 65,000 square metres and was divided into two symmetrical units, one reserved for the First Team with dressing rooms, warehouse, medical rooms, gymnasium and annexed managerial offices and meeting rooms and a conference room, and one dedicated to the youth sector with the same services, as well as a large regulation gymnasium for indoor work and major events. Outside, the area was structured into five football pitches for training, four of which were grass pitches and an additional clay one.

After his untimely death, the club decided to name the Technical Centre after Piermario Morosini (as he had been a Vicenza footballer for three seasons).

Following the club&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Technical Centre, which has been owned since its construction in 2006 by the company Sporting Club Isola srl (which also went bankrupt) with regard the structure and River srl with the 5 football pitches, was abandoned.

After training at the municipal sports facilities of Capovilla di Caldogno, since October 2021 the first team has been training at the new training centre called Sporting Club 55 owned by OTB Group, the holding company that controls the club and located in Fellette di Romano d&#x27;Ezzelino, on the slopes of Monte Grappa. The new facility, which housed the youth sector since 2018, is equipped with an exclusive area for LR Vicenza and another multipurpose area open to the public, as well as a guest house equipped with rooms and areas, partly exclusive and partly common. The sports centre is equipped with two regulation football pitches with a grandstand, a football pitch with synthetic grass, two 6 vs 6 football pitches with synthetic grass, three 5 vs 5 football pitches with synthetic grass (covered for the winter season), six padel pitches covered for the winter season, four clay tennis courts (two of which are covered), two beach volleyball courts, two swimming pools and a hydro-massage pool. Inside, the centre has a 300 square metre gym, a wellness area with a Turkish bath and rooms dedicated to massages and therapies. The centre is then completed with changing rooms, meeting and video rooms and a bistro area.

== Company structure ==
The club offices are located at Largo Paolo Rossi 9, in a building inside the &quot;Stadio Romeo Menti&quot; area. Opposite the company offices is &quot;Casa Vicenza&quot;, a club house built in 2017 with a hospitality area and press room.

=== Company structure ===
L.R. Vicenza is a joint-stock company (SpA); since 29 May 2018 it has been owned by the Vicenza-based OTB Group of Breganze, the holding company of entrepreneur Renzo Rosso. In addition to OTB Group (which holds the majority share), several other companies or entrepreneurs from Vicenza have been shareholders of L.R. Vicenza since 18 February 2019, including Better Silver Spa, Cleops Srl (investment company of Zambon Group Farmaceutici), Dainese Spa, Futura (holding company of the Chilese family), Marcello Cestaro, OMIS Spa, Paolo Scaroni, Pelletterie Sagi Srl, QDB Srl, Rino Mastrotto and SIPE Spa (Maltauro Group).

== Youth sector ==
The club&#x27;s youth sector boasts two consecutive victories in the Viareggio Tournament, in 1954 and 1955.

It is divided into four areas

* &quot;Competitive activity&quot;, with teams that participate in the &quot;Primavera&quot; or &quot;Berretti&quot; championships, U17, U16, U15, U14 and U13 youth teams;
* &quot;Grassroots activities&quot;, which groups together the &quot;Beginners&quot; and &quot;Pupils&quot; teams;
* &quot;Football School&quot;, which groups the &quot;primi calci&quot; (7–8 years old) and the &quot;piccoli amici&quot; (5–6 years old)* &quot;Vicenza Academy&quot;, which is the affiliation of almost 40 football clubs in the Veneto region to LR Vicenza with the aim of developing young talent also through scouts (each scout has his own working area, even outside the region).

Over the decades, the biancorosso nursery has nurtured numerous players who have gone on to play in the first team, from the club&#x27;s early days to the present day. Among those who started at Vicenza are Vicenza native Roberto Baggio (considered one of the best players in the history of world football, winner of the 1993 Ballon d&#x27;Or), Gino Vallesella (the first biancorosso captain), brothers and Vicenza natives Umberto Menti and Romeo Menti and their nephew Luigi Menti (second all-time for appearances and first for appearances in the top division in the Vicenza jersey), Alberto Marchetti (seventh all-time for appearances and third among goal scorers), Bruno Quaresima (tenth all-time for appearances and second among scorers), Mirko Pavinato, Giancarlo Fusato, Renzo Cappellaro, Nevio Scala, Massimo Briaschi, Giorgio Sterchele, Nicola Zanini, Paolo Zanetti and Luca Rigoni.

Between the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, mention must be made of Christian Maggio from Vicenza: having grown up in the Vicenza youth sector, he made his debut in the first team on the first day of the 2000–2001 Serie A, establishing himself in the following years elsewhere and in the senior national team.

The youth teams train in Vicenza in the facilities of Via Gagliardotti, Stanga, Saviabona, San Pio X, Bertesinella and Pomari, while in Bassano in the facilities of Cartigliano, Centro Giovanile and Sporting 55.

In recent years several former biancorossi players at the end of their careers have decided to coach the different areas of the youth sector.

==Notable former managers==

There have been 75 coaches who have taken on the technical leadership of Vicenza since 1902. Among their nationalities, Italian prevails.

The first coach in the history of the biancorossa was Antonio Libero Scarpa, who led the team from 1902 to 1908; he was also president of Vicenza from 1903 to 1908.

The one with the longest tenure is still Giulio Fasolo from Vicenza, who remained at the helm of the team for 10 seasons, seven of which were consecutive, from 1908–1909 to 1914–1915, and following the activity suspended between 1915 and 1919 due to the exposure of the Vicenza area on the front line of the First World War, he was once again coach from 1919–1920 to 1921–1922. Giulio Fasolo was coach when the Vicenza team came close to winning the Scudetto in the 1910–1911 season.

There were many foreign coaches in the 1920s and 1930s, the first in the Biancorossa&#x27;s history being Austrian Franz Sedlacek, who led the team in the 1922–1923 season.

Among the foreign coaches, those who boast the highest number of presences on the red and white bench are the Hungarians Wilmas Wilhelm and Imre Janos Bekey and the Uruguayan Hector Puricelli.

A coach who marked the biancorossa&#x27;s history was Giovan Battista Fabbri. A Vicenza coach from 1976 to 1979, he was at the helm of the Vicenza team that came close to winning the Serie A in the 1977–1978 season. The Emilian coach had the intuition of moving Paolo Rossi from right winger to prolific centre forward.

Francesco Guidolin coached Vicenza from 1994 to 1998, winning the 1996-97 Coppa Italia and reaching the semi-finals of the 1997-98 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. During his years at Vicenza he normally favoured the 4–4–2, while in some delicate matches, played on defensive tactics, he opted for the 4-5-1 and 5–4–1.

Under the leadership of Edoardo Reja, at the end of the 1999–2000 season, the team achieved promotion to Serie A for the last time.

Both players and coaches of Vicenza (in chronological order) were: Giulio Fasolo, Aldo Casalini, Wilmas Wilhelm, Eraldo Bedendo, Pietro Spinato, Umberto Menti, Roberto Lerici, Antonio Pin, Chinesinho, Giulio Savoini, Ernesto Galli, Fabio Viviani, Giancarlo Camolese, Massimo Beghetto, Manlio Zanini, Alessandro Dal Canto, Giovanni Lopez, Nicola Zanini and Domenico Di Carlo.

== Fans and Ultras ==
Vicenza has numerous fans both in Italy and abroad.

The ultras movement was born in Vicenza in 1974 when, in October of that year, the &quot;Ultras&quot; group was founded. On 9 November of the following year, the second group of organised Berici supporters was founded: &quot;I Marines&quot;. The two groups resided in the Curva Sud and both had a skull as their symbol. In addition to these two groups, other groups of organised supporters were the &quot;Vigilantes&quot;, the main and historical group of the Curva Sud, born in 1978 and disbanded on 1 September 2012, after 34 years of presence: the symbol of the &quot;Vigilantes&quot; was a hooded head, called the &quot;boia&quot;, with two crossed axes in the background.

Besides the &quot;Vigilantes&quot;, the other three historical groups of the Curva Sud were the &quot;Fabio Group&quot;, the &quot;Caneva Berica&quot; and the &quot;Kapovolti&quot;. The &quot;Fabio Group&quot;, whose symbol was the tao, was founded in 1990 in memory of the death of &quot;Vigilantes&quot; fan Fabio Cucco. &quot;Caneva Berica&quot;, founded in 1990, had as its symbol a demijohn of wine while &quot;Kapovolti&quot;, founded in 1993, had as its logo a face of a drunken man with his tongue out, very similar to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. Until the 1997-1998 season the &quot;Fabio Group&quot; and &quot;Kapovolti&quot; fans resided in the Curva Sud; then from the 1998-1999 season they both settled in the Curva Nord, then in 2004 came the dissolution of these two groups. 

In the second half of the 1980s, there was the birth of the Vecchia Guardia, or Old Guard. This was a group created by the same founders of the Vigilantes, whose banner was placed in the centre of the Curva Sud by the Vigilantes themselves, and was used in delicate moments for the fate of Vicenza, such as in the two most painful biancorosse seasons, 1988-1989 and 1989-1990, when Vicenza risked relegation to Serie C2 both times.

Today the main Curva Sud groups are: &quot;South Terrace&quot;, &quot;Lanerossi Crew 1902&quot;, &quot;Lanerossi Youth&quot;, &quot;Banda Thiene&quot;, &quot;Caneva Berica,&quot; and &quot;Vecchia Guardia&quot;.

=== Rivalries and friendships ===
The Vicenza ultras have a strong twinning with the Pescara fans: this is the first twinning in history between two ultras fans and dates back to 9 January 1977. Vicenza fans are also twinned with Reggiana (since 1982), Cremonese (since 1984), Udinese (since the 80s) and FC Metz (since 1997).

Vicenza also has friendships with Millwall (since 2015), Olympique Lyon and Vigor Lamezia.

The most heated rivalry has always been and remains the one with Hellas Verona the challenge between the two teams is known as the ‘derby of Veneto’ and constitutes the greatest football rivalry in the region, as well as being the most heartfelt confrontation due: the two are the oldest and most successful clubs in Veneto. This historic rivalry, which is rooted in confronations between the neighbouring cities of Vicenza and Verona during the middleages, persists to this day with numerous incidents. 

Another historic rivalry with serious clashes is the one with Napoli: this relationship, which has always been antagonistic between the two fan groups, was accentuated even more in the mid-1990s, during home matches at the &quot;Menti&quot;, with incidents in and outside the Vicenza stadium occurring in March 1996, in January and May 1997; in addition to the violent episodes that occurred in the Coppa Italia final of the same year: during the first leg at the &quot;San Paolo&quot; there was throwing of fireworks, bombs and bathroom fittings, while at the return leg at the &quot;Menti&quot; there was the stabbing of a Vicenza supporter by the Neapolitan fans and the firing of flares from the Azzurri ultras which caused a burn to the face of an Udinese supporter.

In addition to the historical rivalries with Hellas Verona and Napoli, there are also other historical rivalries with: Padova, Brescia, Triestina (accentuated by their friendship with Verona and Lazio), SPAL, Cesena, Bologna, Atalanta and Venezia.

Relations with the supporters of the &quot;big three&quot; of Italian football are also bad: Juventus (the ties of hatred with the Juventus fans grew even stronger in 1996, when considerable incidents between the &quot;Vigilantes Vicenza&quot; and the Juventus ultras group &quot;Fighters&quot;), AC Milan, and Inter Milan (long-standing rivals, also accentuated by the friendship that united the Hellas Verona, Lazio and Nerazzurri fans).

Internationally, the only rivalry worth mentioning is the one with Chelsea, dating back to 1998 during the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final played between Chelsea and Vicenza (due to a large number of Verona supporters being present in the Vicenza stadium with Chelsea fans).

==Vicenza in popular culture==
LR Vicenza, as one of the Italian clubs that have played the most Serie A championships, is featured in various works of Italian film, television as well as in music, and even in video games.

In films sphere, it is worth mentioning &quot;Ultimo minuto&quot;, a 1987 film directed by Pupi Avati and starring Ugo Tognazzi, Elena Sofia Ricci, Marco Leonardi and Diego Abatantuono; Vicenza, the Romeo Menti Stadium and the Curva Sud fans are also credited. In this film, both the inside and outside of the stadium were used as locations for filming. The red and white colours of the team featured in the film and some of its characteristics recall Vicenza, the emblem of the classic provincial team of national football in those years. The filming of the Vicenza Curva Sud was carried out on 26 April 1987 during the Vicenza-Cesena match. The stadium is also recognisable by the presence of the red and white banners of the ultras from Vicenza and the Pal Zileri billboard placed above the centre of the Curva Sud.

Also on the big screen, in the autumn of 2020, the filming of the film &quot;Mancino naturale&quot;, starring Claudia Gerini, Katia Ricciarelli and Massimo Ranieri, was shot at the Romeo Menti stadium: the main character, a fan of the Vicenza team, was named Paolo by his parents in honour of Paolo Rossi.

Tito Buy, founder in 1902 and first president of Vicenza, is the great-grandfather of actress Margherita Buy, while among the best-known fans of the Berici team is adult entretainer Rocco Siffredi.

In the musical sphere, the Vicenza punk rock band Derozer wrote the song &quot;Fedeli alla tribù&quot; in honour of Vicenza&#x27;s away match at Stamford Bridge in London against Chelsea in the semi-final return leg of the 1997–1998 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Vicenza is also the subject of a 2018 song by singer Francesca Michielin, &quot;La Serie B&quot;, inspired by the relegation of the biancorossa team to Serie B in 2001.

Among other media, the Calciatori Panini album from the 1995–1996 season Vicenza&#x27;s Gustavo Méndez as the cover photo as he races at speed with George Weah in the Vicenza-Milan match on 22 October 1995; while the &quot;PC Calcio 5.0&quot; video game from the 1996–1997 season had as its global cover a photo of the biancorosso captain Giovanni Lopez grappling with Christian Vieri, taken during the Juventus–Vicenza match on 1 March 1997.

<doc id="1136841" wikidata="Q1478433" url="?curid=1136841" title="The Philosophers' Football Match">
<text>&quot;International Philosophy&quot;, commonly referred to as the Philosophers&#x27; Football Match, is a Monty Python sketch depicting a football match in the Munich Olympiastadion between philosophers representing Greece and Germany. Starring in the sketch are Archimedes (John Cleese), Socrates (Eric Idle), Hegel (Graham Chapman), Nietzsche (Michael Palin), Marx (Terry Jones), and Kant (Terry Gilliam). Palin also provides the match television commentary.

The footage opens with the banner headline &quot;International Philosophy&quot;, and Palin providing the narrative. Confucius is the referee and keeps times with an hourglass. St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine (sporting haloes) serve as linesmen. The German manager is Martin Luther. The match is designed as a World Cup for the most well-known western philosophers made global with Confucius arbitrating the match. As play begins, the philosophers break from their proper football positions only to walk around on the pitch as if deeply pondering, and in some cases declaiming their theories. Franz Beckenbauer, the sole genuine footballer on the pitch and a &quot;surprise inclusion&quot; in the German team, is left more than a little confused.

Despite being set in the Olympiastadion, the sketch was instead filmed in Munich&#x27;s Grünwalder Stadion. It originally featured in the second &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; episode broadcast on 18 December 1972 and was regularly screened at the group&#x27;s live shows, including &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; (1982) and &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; (2014).

The Greek players, mostly with long grey beards and hair, play in togas, while the Germans sport a variety of period dress including Victorian frock coats and breeches. &quot;Nobby&quot; Hegel carries a grey top hat, while Beckenbauer wears the red and white of the 1972 Bayern Munich football strip.

==Outcome==
Nietzsche is booked with a yellow card for arguing with the referee, claiming he has &quot;no free will&quot;. Confucius responded by saying: &quot;Name go in book&quot;.

In the second half, with nothing being accomplished on the pitch other than mere contemplation, Karl Marx is noticed warming up vigorously on the German sidelines. Marx soon comes on to substitute Ludwig Wittgenstein, his energy appearing as an obvious game-changer. However, upon the restart, Marx simply pulls up and starts meandering in deep thought like the rest.

With just over a minute of the match remaining, Archimedes cries out &quot;Eureka!&quot;, takes the first kick of the ball and rushes towards the German goal. After several passes through a perplexed defence, Socrates scores the only goal of the match with a diving header off an otherwise goal-bound cross from Archimedes.

As the sketch closes, the Germans dispute the call. Through the words of the commentator, &quot;Hegel is arguing that reality is merely an &quot;a priori&quot; adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical imperative is holding that ontologically, it exists only in the imagination and Marx is claiming it was offside&quot;. The replay proves that, according to the offside rule, Socrates was indeed offside, but the sketch, nevertheless, states that the Greeks have won.

The names of the Greek philosophers in the lineup are displayed in German in the sketch, as the match was set in Germany. Despite the sketch, Wittgenstein was in fact Austrian and not German, while Empedocles and Archimedes lived in Sicily. Supporting the main referee Confucius as linesmen were St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, who hailed from what is now Algeria and Italy respectively.

==Philosophers Football Match 2010==

Inspired by the famous Monty Python sketch, and with the full backing of the surviving Pythons a tribute/replay of &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match&quot; was held at Wingate &amp; Finchley&#x27;s Harry Abrahams Stadium in Finchley, North London on 9 May 2010.

This tongue-in-cheek re-staging—on a real London pitch—of the original sketch, was the idea of The Philosophy Shop, a specialist provider of education and training for primary school children. The group works to enable Philosophy graduates at University level to conduct practical philosophy sessions for children aged 5 to 11 as part of a drive to boost their reasoning skills from their first days in the school environment.

Philosopher A. C. Grayling and former England Manager Graham Taylor were appointed as managers for the event, and players included comedians Mark Steel, Tony Hawks, Arthur Smith, and Ariane Sherine, as well as philosophers Julian Baggini, Nigel Warburton, Simon Glendinning, Stephen Law, Angie Hobbs, and Mark Vernon, plus other academics from universities nationwide. Match supporters included sociologist and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Thinking Allowed&quot; presenter Laurie Taylor, the BBC&#x27;s John Humphrys, and educationalist and author Anthony Seldon.

<text>Jesse Hartley (21 December 1780 – 24 August 1860) was an English Civil Engineer and Superintendent of the Concerns of the Dock Estate in Liverpool, England between 1824 and 1860.

==Hartley&#x27;s career==
Despite having no experience building docks, Hartley was the first full-time professional dock engineer in the world. He had previously worked for his father Bernard Hartley, a stonemason, architect and bridgemaster John Carr, and the Duke of Devonshire.

Initially he was appointed deputy dock surveyor to John Foster Jr. However, due to Foster resigning three days later, Hartley was promoted to acting dock surveyor. During his service, he not only built new docks, but also modernised all of the existing docks with the exception of the Old Dock (opened in 1715), which had become disused and filled in. The docks at Liverpool grew from during his tenure.

In 1831 he was appointed to convert the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal to a railway line. He persuaded the company to keep the canal open and build the railway more or less along its route.

Between 1841 and 1843 he prepared a number of different designs for fireproof construction of dockside warehouses. In 1843, he made models of warehouse arches at the Trentham Street Dockyard, to test sheet iron lined timber floored building method and brick and iron building materials. Through fire testing of these models, he eventually convinced the Dock Board Trustees of the benefits of his iron framed construction method. These experiments proved the worthiness of his fireproof design and he designed the Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool to these specifications.

Hartley&#x27;s improvements over earlier dock and warehouse design included the use of locks to keep the water at a constant level, so that loading and unloading of ships’ cargoes was not reliant on the tide and the enclosure of the dock with high boundary walls, to reduce theft. He also adapted and improved the design of St Katherine&#x27;s Dock in London, by incorporating high arches in the buildings to accommodate cranes.

In his younger days, Hartley is reputed to have worked for William Alexander Madocks at Port Madock (now Porthmadog) in Caernarfonshire, Wales. Examination of the piers of the Britannia Bridge there, across the River/Afon Glaslyn, shows cyclopean masonry of the type used by Hartley in Liverpool. The bridge can be dated c.1810 (give or take a year), was probably built in the dry and the river diverted through it in 1811/1812. The parapets have been renewed; there is a main road and a tramway/railway running across the bridge. Evidence of the original tramway was found during renewal of the road surface about 2008. It is thought by some to be the oldest railway bridge in the world still in use, but it has not carried a tramway/railway for the whole of that time.

<doc id="1136865" wikidata="Q6819046" url="?curid=1136865" title="Merepeka Raukawa-Tait">
<text>Merepeka Raukawa-Tait is a New Zealand politician and former chief executive of the Women&#x27;s Refuge organisation of New Zealand. She was a councilor at large for the Rotorua District Council from 2011 to 2022. She previously stood as a candidate for Parliament, serving briefly as deputy leader of the small Christian Heritage Party.

==Early life==
Raukawa-Tait was born in Feilding, New Zealand and raised a Catholic. She has worked in a number of jobs, both in New Zealand and in Zurich, Switzerland. In the early 1990s she was in business in Rotorua and was a member of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for one term.

Her most well-known role was as chief executive of Women&#x27;s Refuge, an organisation that supports women who suffer domestic violence. She was a contentious chief executive bringing embarrassment to the organisation after attending the premiere of a strip club in central Wellington causing staff to lose faith in her judgment 

==Political career==
===Local government candidacies===
In 2001, she made a high-profile bid for the mayoralty of Wellington; however, after a weak performance at a candidates&#x27; meeting and a perceived failure to articulate policies and vision for the city, her support tapered off and she eventually placed sixth.

In 2003 Raukawa-Tait stood as a District Council candidate in a controversial and unsuccessful by-election campaign for the Masterton District Council. She finished last. She left Masterton after her election defeat.

===Christian Heritage Party===
Shortly before the 2002 elections, it was announced that Raukawa-Tait would be standing as a candidate for the Christian Heritage Party. This surprised many commentators, as Raukawa-Tait&#x27;s previous comments did not indicate a great affinity with Christian Heritage policies – in particular, she was considered to be markedly more tolerant of homosexuality than the party. As a personal recruit of then party leader Graham Capill, Raukawa-Tait was immediately elected deputy leader of the party.

In the election itself, Raukawa-Tait contested the Wairarapa electorate against Labour&#x27;s Georgina Beyer. Raukawa-Tait eventually placed third, winning 19% of the vote. This was the best result achieved by any Christian Heritage candidate in that election. Not long after the election, however, Raukawa-Tait and Capill entered into a dispute about the election campaign. Her campaign manager, Adam Owens, alleged that Capill&#x27;s management of the party&#x27;s campaign was poor, with little strategy and poor advertising. Owens alleged that the party was being financially mismanaged by Capill, and that he was not a &quot;proper person&quot; to lead a political party. After a protracted dispute, Raukawa-Tait and the entire Wairarapa Electorate Committee resigned from the party, citing &quot;the lack of financial accountability&quot; and &quot;un-Christian threats and intimidation&quot;. In 2003 she reconciled with Capill, and they gave joint interviews in national newspapers saying that their falling out had been the fault of Adam Owens, and they jointly condemned him.

===Rotorua District Council, 2011–2022===
Merepeka Raukawa-Tait was elected to the Rotorua District Council in 2011. In 2013 Merepeka was re-elected to the Rotorua District Council.

===Te Pāti Māori candidacy===
In the election, Raukawa-Tait stood for the Māori Party on its list in position 9. 

In the election, Raukawa-Tait is contesting the electorate for the party, which has since been renamed to Te Pāti Māori. On the party&#x27;s list, she was ranked number 8. During the 2023 election, Raukawa Tait came third place in Rotorua, gaining 2,731 votes.

==Life outside politics==

She worked as CEO of the West Auckland Hospice for a time, and she works as a speaker and consultant and has appeared from time to time as a panellist on the television advice show &quot;How&#x27;s Life&quot;. She lives in Rotorua, works as a celebrity speaker.

In 1993 she was convicted in the Rotorua District Court, under her previous name Merepeka Sims, for failing to pay her employees&#x27; PAYE tax to the Inland Revenue, a serious offence under New Zealand law, because she said she needed the money for her businesses.

<text>Empoli Football Club is an Italian professional football club based in Empoli, Tuscany. Founded in 1920, the side is part of a select group of Italian football clubs not based in a provincial capital city that have participated in Serie A.

Empoli has spent most of its history in professional football. Empoli competed in European competitions once, in which they were eliminated in the qualification stage of 2007–08 UEFA Cup.

==History==
===From the 1920s to the 1970s===
In August 1920 in Empoli, &quot;Foot Ball Club Empoli&quot; and the football section &quot;Unione Sportiva Empoli&quot; were born. After the participation of a tournament in San Miniato, the two merged into a single local football club. The next season, the new club, after having obtained in September affiliation in the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) ratified by the Tuscan Regional Committee, was included in Group A of the Tuscan Promozione 1921–22, but did take part due to economic problems, choosing instead to join the league of Terza Categoria, where the team achieved second place in the group A.

In the 1922–23 season, Empoli finished in second place in Group A of the Terza Categoria, gaining admission to the final round after winning the play-off in Florence, held on 15 April 1923 against Pontedera, 1–0. The season concluded with a third place in the group final.

From 1923 to 1926, Empoli continued to play in the Tuscan third division. Then, in the 1926–27 season, Empoli won the Group A division of Tuscany, and was admitted to the interregional finals; thanks to a fourth place in Group G, the Tuscans were promoted in the North Division of the Second Division 1927–28, the third Italian football tier of the era. In the following season the team was then inserted in Group C of the North Division, which concluded in fourth place, but for economic reasons refused the invitation to take part in the next championship of Prima Divisione, and therefore followed the downgrading of the Seconda Divisione from third to fourth tier. However, already the following season, in the 1928–29 Seconda Divisione, the club won promotion, winning the Tuscan championship, and returned to the North Division of Prima Divisione.

Empoli was in the Prima Divisione, then Serie C, until the 1935–36 season, when the team withdrawn halfway through the season because of the call to arms for many of its players. Empoli resumed competitive activity from Prima Divisione the next season, under the name of &quot;OND Empoli&quot;, with the colours gray and blue; the team won the Tuscan Group A again gaining admission in Serie C. Until the shutdown from the causes of war, Empoli played in Serie C, obtaining a best result of sixth place in 1938–39. Meanwhile, the club was renamed &quot;OND Interaziendale Italo Gambaccioni Section Soccer&quot; from 1938 to 1941, until the name was changed again to &quot;Associazione Calcio Empol&quot;. On 15 September 1935, Empoli debuted in the Coppa Italia with a 1–0 home success against Pontedera.

After World War II, Empoli took up the club name of &quot;Empoli Foot Ball Club&quot; after being called &quot;Sports Group Azelio Landi&quot; for a brief period between October and November 1944, and was admitted into Serie B thanks to a third-place finish in the 1945–46 season. In Serie B, Empoli played for four consecutive seasons, finishing in third place in the 1946–47 season. Relegation of the club – which by then had adopted the colour blue – occurred at the end of 1949–50 championship. The permanence in Serie C lasted for six seasons: in the summer of 1955, the club sold most of its players and at the end of the 1955–56 season, the Tuscan side were relegated to Serie D. After three seasons in the fourth division, in 1959–60 the &quot;Azzurri&quot; risked relegation to the regional level after finishing in 15th place, on equal points with Carrarese and Rieti. The club managed to escape relegation before drawing with Carrarese and then surpassing Lazio, in Pesaro, with a goal from Vezzosi. In 1960–61, Empoli returned to the third tier of Italian football, but for only one season, again suffering relegation.

The club returned to Serie C on 9 June 1963 after beating Tempio 2–0 in the play-off in Genoa. The club&#x27;s permanence in the third tier of Italian football, then called Serie C1, lasted for 20 years until the 1982–83 season.

===The 1980s and 1990s===
In 1986, the small-town club was promoted to Serie A. Playing their first few home games in Florence, Empoli&#x27;s Serie A debut resulted in a 1–0 win over Internazionale. Helped by a nine-point deduction from Udinese, they avoided relegation with 23 points and 13 goals in 30 games. Empoli themselves received a five-point penalty the following season, and were relegated despite an improved showing. They were relegated again to Serie C1 in 1989.

This club then spent several seasons in Serie C1 before returning to Serie B in 1996 and achieving a second successive promotion in 1997. With Luciano Spalletti at the helm, Empoli defied the odds to finish in 12th place and avoid relegation. Relegation the following year began a three-year stay in Serie B, in which time the club became renowned for nurturing its own outstanding young talent.

Promotions to Serie A in 2002 and 2005 have seen the club emerge as battlers against relegation. They ended the 2005–06 season in tenth place in the top-flight. As a result of the Serie A match-fixing scandal at the end of that season, they gained qualification for the UEFA Cup for the following season, but did not participate as club management failed to apply for a UEFA licence. In the 2006–07 season, the club once again qualified for the UEFA Cup.

===The years 2000 and participation in the UEFA Cup===
With the prospect of European football approaching, the management strengthened the squad, most notably signing a number of young players from large Serie A clubs, such as Rincón of Inter, Ignazio Abate and Lino Marzoratti of Milan and Sebastian Giovinco, Claudio Marchisio and Rej Volpato of Juventus on loan or co-ownership deals. Empoli marked their debut in the UEFA Cup with a two-legged match against Zürich, losing 4–2 on aggregate. A poor showing in the initial part of the season then led chairman Fabrizio Corsi to sack Luigi Cagni, who led the Tuscans to UEFA Cup qualification, and replace him with Alberto Malesani. However, the club&#x27;s fortunes did not change and Malesani was sacked after a 2–0 defeat to Sampdoria which left them at the bottom of the table. Cagni was re-appointed on 31 March 2008 but the team suffered a last-minute relegation. Cagni resigned and was replaced by Silvio Baldini ahead of the 2008–09 season. Baldini&#x27;s tenure, however, did not prove to be successful, as the Tuscans ended the season only in fifth place, and were later defeated in the promotion playoffs by Brescia.

===Between Serie B and Serie A===
Despite modest results, Baldini was sacked. By December 2011, the club had gone through four coaches since the 2009–10 season. The club maintained their Serie B status dramatically in 2011–12. After a poor season, Empoli finished 18th, one point from safety, which meant a relegation play-off against Vicenza over two legs. The first game finished goalless before Vicenza led 2–0 in the second leg with 30 minutes to go. However, two goals in two minutes saw the &quot;Azzuri&quot; level the tie before Massimo Maccarone secured a 3–2 victory in the fourth minute of injury time. 2012–13 saw the club finish fourth, a dramatic improvement on the previous season, but lost the promotion play-off final to Livorno over two legs. The club secured promotion back to Serie A the following season, finishing as runners-up to Palermo and stayed in the top flight for two seasons, finishing 15th in 2014–15 and 10th in 2015–16. Going into the final matchday of the 2016–17 Serie A season, Empoli were one point above the relegation zone ahead of Crotone, however were eventually relegated to Serie B after they failed to beat Palermo, while Crotone beat Lazio. After a triumph of the 2017–18 Serie B, Empoli promptly regained promotion to Serie A, after winning Serie B on 28 April 2018, four matches in advance. On the final matchday of the 2018–19 Serie A season, Empoli were one point above the relegation zone ahead of Genoa, however were eventually relegated to Serie B after they were defeated by Internazionale; while Genoa drew with Fiorentina, both sides finished on the same number of points, but Genoa had a greater goal difference by one. However, Empoli finished first in the 2020–21 Serie B season, their third title in the competition in their history, and so returned to Serie A after two seasons. In the 2023–24 season, Empoli secured their continued presence in Serie A, following a stoppage time goal in a 2–1 victory against Roma on the final matchday.
