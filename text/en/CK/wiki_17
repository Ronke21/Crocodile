<text>Hauppauge Computer Works ( ) is a US manufacturer and marketer of electronic video hardware for personal computers. Although it is most widely known for its WinTV line of TV tuner cards for PCs, Hauppauge also produces personal video recorders, digital video editors, digital media players, hybrid video recorders and digital television products for both Windows and Mac. The company is named after the hamlet of Hauppauge, New York, in which it is based.

In addition to its headquarters in New York, Hauppauge also has sales and technical support offices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Spain and the UK.

==Company history==
Hauppauge was co-founded by Kenneth Plotkin and Kenneth Aupperle, and became incorporated in 1982.

Starting in 1983, the company followed Microway, the company that a year earlier provided the software needed by scientists and engineers to modify the IBM PC Fortran compiler so that it could transparently employ Intel 8087 coprocessors. The 80-bit Intel 8087 math coprocessor ran a factor of 50 faster than the 8/16-bit 8088 CPU that the IBM PC software came with. However, in 1982, the speed-up in floating-point-intensive applications was only a factor of 10 as the initial software developed by Microway and Hauppauge continued to call floating point libraries to do computations instead of placing inline x87 instructions inline with the 8088&#x27;s instructions that allowed the 8088 to drive the 8087 directly. By 1984, inline compilers made their way into the market providing increased speed ups. Hauppauge provided similar software products in competition with Microway that they bundled with math coprocessors and remained in the Intel math coprocessor business until 1993 when the Intel Pentium came out with a built-in math coprocessor. However, like other companies that entered the math coprocessor business, Hauppauge produced other products that contributed to a field that is today called HPC - high-performance computing.

The math coprocessor business rapidly expanded starting in 1984 with software products that accelerated applications like Lotus 1-2-3. At the same time the advent of the 80286 based IBM PC/AT with its 80287 math coprocessor provided new opportunities for companies that had grown up selling 8087s and supporting software. This included products like Hauppauge&#x27;s 287 Fast/5, a product that took advantage of the 80287&#x27;s design that used an asynchronous clock to drive its FPU at 5 MHz instead of the 4 MHz clocking provided by IBM, making it possible for the 80287s that came with the AT to be overclocked to 12 MHz.

By 1987, math coprocessors had become Intel&#x27;s most profitable product line bringing in competition from vendors like Cyrix whose first product was a math coprocessor faster than the new Intel 80387, but whose speed was stalled by the 80386 that acted as a governor. This is when Andy Grove decided it was time for Intel to recapture its channel to market opening up a division to compete with its math coprocessor customers that by this time included 47th Street Camera. The new Intel division, PCEO (the PC Enhancement Operation) came out with a product called &quot;Genuine Intel Math Coprocessors&quot;. After playing around in the accelerator board business PCEO would settle down in the 80386 motherboard business originally selling a motherboard designed by one of its engineers as a home project that eventually ended up with a new division that today sells 40% of the motherboards used in high end PCs that find their way into products including Supercomputers, medical products, etc.

Companies like Hauppauge and Microway that were impacted by their new competitor that made their living accelerating floating point applications being run on PCs followed suit by venturing into the Intel i860 vector coprocessor business: Hauppauge came out with an Intel 80486 motherboard that included an Intel i860 vector processor while Microway came out with add-in cards that had between one or more i860s. These products along with transputer-based add-in cards would eventually lead into what became known as HPC (high performance computing). HPC was actually initiated in 1986 by an English company, Inmos, that designed a CPU competitive with an Intel 80386/387 that also included four twisted pair high-speed interconnects that could communicate with other transputers and be linked to a PC motherboard making it possible to create distributed memory processing computers that could employ 32 processors with the same throughput as 32 Intel 386/387s operating in a single PC. The add-in card parallel processing business morphed from the transputer to the Intel i860 around 1989 when Inmos was purchased by STMicroelectronics that cut R&amp;D funding eventually forcing companies that had entered the parallel processing business to shift to the Intel i860. The i860 was a vector processor with graphics extensions that could initially provide 50 megaflops of throughput in an era when an 80486 with an Intel 80487 peaked at half a megaflop and would eventually top out at 100 Megaflops making it as fast as 100 Inmos T414 transputers. Intel i860 add-in cards made it possible for as many as 20 Intel i860s to run in parallel and could be programmed using a software library similar to today&#x27;s MPI libraries which today support distributed memory parallel processing in which servers sitting in 1U rack mount chassis that are essentially PCs provide the horsepower behind the majority of the world&#x27;s supercomputers. This same approach could be employed using Hauppauge&#x27;s motherboards connected by Gigabit Ethernet, something that was however first demonstrated using a wall of IBM RS/6000 PCs at the 1991 Supercomputing Conference. IBM&#x27;s lead was quickly followed by academic users who realized they could do the same thing with much less expensive hardware by adapting their x86 PCs to run in parallel at first using a software library adapted from similar transputer libraries called PVM (parallel virtual machines) that would eventually morph into today&#x27;s MPI. Products like the Intel i860 vector processor that could be employed both as a vector and graphics processor were end of life&#x27;d around 1993 at the same time that Intel introduced the Intel Pentium P5: a CISC processor that used CISC instructions that were pipelined into hard coded lower level RISC like primitives that provided the Pentium with a Superscalar architecture that also could execute the x87 FPU instruction set using a built in FPU that was essentially implemented using the scalar instructions of the i860 as well as a memory bus that provided a 400 MB/sec interface to memory that was borrowed from the i860 as well. This high speed bus played a crucial role in speeding up the most common floating point intensive applications that at this point in time used Gauss Elimination to solve simultaneous linear equations buy which today are solved using blocking and LU decomposition. The Intel Pentium, while good, did not provide enough floating point performance to compete with a 300 MHz DEC Alpha 21164 that provided 600 Megaflops in 1995. At the same point in time, Intel supercomputing had moved from the 50 MHz Intel i860XP that was six times slower than the Alpha 21164 to the special version of their Pentium that at 200 megaflops was only three times slower than the 21164. However, the impending speed upgrade of the Alpha to 600 MHz ultimately doomed the future of Intel supercomputing.

===Motherboards===

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hauppauge produced motherboards for Intel 486 processors. A number of these motherboards were standard ISA built to fairly competitive price points. Some, however, were workstation and server-oriented, including EISA support, optional cache memory modules, and support for the Weitek 4167 FPU.

Hauppauge also sold a unique motherboard, the Hauppauge 4860. This was the only standard PC/AT motherboard ever made with both an Intel 80486 and an Intel i860 processor (optional). While both required the 80486, the i860 could either run an independent lightweight operating system or serve as a more conventional co-processor.

Hauppauge no longer produces motherboards, focusing instead on the TV card market.
==Product lines==

===Digital Terrestrial/Satellite===
Hauppauge digital terrestrial and satellite products capture DVB-T and DVB-S broadcasts respectively without the need to re-encode the streams. There are several benefits from this approach:
* the cost of the TV card can be lower because there is no need to supply an MPEG-2 encoder
* the quality of captures can be higher because there is no need to re-encode streams
* ratio of file size to quality is higher due to the broadcasters&#x27; high-efficiency encoders
Until August 2004 all of Hauppauge&#x27;s DVB products were badge-engineered TechnoTrend products. The first of the new Hauppauge-designed cards was the Nova-t PCI 90002 and the silent replacement of the TechnoTrend model caused confusion and anger among Hauppauge&#x27;s customers who found that the new card didn&#x27;t support TechnoTrend&#x27;s proprietary interfaces. This rendered any existing third-party software unusable with the new cards. The new cards also came with a software packaged called WinTV2000 which lacked features that TechnoTrend&#x27;s software had including seven-day EPG, Digital Teletext and LCN-based channel ordering. The new cards supported Microsoft&#x27;s BDA standard but at the time this was at its infancy and very few 3rd party applications included support for it.

By 2005, all of the TechnoTrend products had been removed from the Hauppauge lineup, with the exception of the DEC2000-t and DEC3000-s which haven&#x27;t seen a replacement.

===Hybrid Video Recorders===
The Hybrid Video Recorder (HVR) range capture a combination of different broadcast types. The majority of Hauppauge HVR models capture analogue PAL and DVB-T but there have been some more recent models which capture analogue NTSC and ATSC as well as a tri-mode card which supports analogue PAL, DVB-S and DVB-T.

HVR-9xx devices are bus-powered USB 2.0 sticks, not much larger than a USB flash drive. They have support for analogue and digital terrestrial TV. The HVR-9xx sticks are produced in Taiwan by Deltron, and are also sold for Apple computers by Elgato under the EyeTV brand.

HVR-1xxx devices are PCI-based products that receive analogue and digital terrestrial TV. They are similar to the HVR-9xx but have support for NICAM or dbx Stereo for analogue terrestrial on all models.

HVR-3xxx and 4xxx devices are tri-mode and quad-mode devices respectively. Tri-mode means support for analogue terrestrial/cable, digital terrestrial and DVB-S digital satellite. Quad-mode devices additionally support DVB-S2 HD digital satellite. The HVR-4000 marks a change in bundled applications in that instead of using Hauppauge&#x27;s WinTV2000 package, it ships with Cyberlink PowerCinema.

===Personal Video Recorders===
The Personal Video Recorder (PVR) range uses an on-board MPEG/MPEG-2 encoder to compress the incoming analogue TV signals. The benefits of using a hardware encoder include lower CPU usage when encoding live TV.

The first WinTV-PVR product was the WinTV PVR-PCI, launched in late 2000 and not receiving any driver updates since February 2002. It was joined by the WinTV PVR-USB, which has two variants. The first variant supported MPEG-2 streams up to 6 Mbit/s and supported Half-D1 resolutions (320 × 480). This was replaced by an updated model supporting up to 12 Mbit/s streams and Full-D1 resolution (720 × 480).

The first WinTV-PVR to gain popularity was the PVR-250. The original version of the PVR-250 was a variant of the Sag Harbor (PVR-350) which used the ivac15 chipset. Although the chipset was able to do hardware decoding the video out components were not included on the card. In later versions of the PVR-250 the ivac15 was replaced with the ivac16 to reduce cost and to relieve heat issues. The PVR-250 and PVR-350 were joined by the USB 2.0 PVR-USB2 to complete their generation of devices.

Their successors, the PVR-150 and PVR-500, were released alongside the PVR-250/350/USB2 and while popular with both OEMs and the general public, there have been numerous driver issues as well as video quality complaints. The PVR-500 was released as a Media Center card and wasn&#x27;t supplied with Hauppauge&#x27;s WinTV2000 software. It was effectively two PVR-150s on a single board, connected via a PCI-PCI bridge chip. The PVR-USB2 was silently replaced with the PVR-USB2+ which is identical both visually and terms of features, but uses a Conexant chipset rather than the Philips chipset in the old model.

From its name and time of release, the PVR-160 appears to be newer than the PVR-150 but it is not. The PVR-160 is a repackaging of the WinTV Roslyn. The Roslyn is based on the Conexant Blackbird design and uses the CX2388x video decoder. This board was originally available only to OEMs and third-party software vendors such as Frey Technologies (SageTV) and Snapstream (BeyondTV). The board was sold under many names including the PVR-250BTV (Snapstream). This card is known to have color and brightness issues that can be corrected somewhat using registry hacks. Hauppauge received a large surplus amount of these cards from OEM and third-party vendors. The cards were repackaged with an MCE remote and receiver and rebranded the PVR-160. The PVR-160 was often mistakenly referred to as the PVR-250MCE but is not related to the PVR-250.

===High-Definition Personal Video Recorder===
In May 2008, Hauppauge released the HD-PVR, a USB 2.0 device with an on-board H.264 hardware encoder for recording from high-definition sources through component inputs. It is the world&#x27;s first USB device that can capture in high definition. The HD-PVR has proved to be a very popular device, and Hauppauge has been updating its drivers and software continually since its release. In addition to being able to capture from any component video source in 480p, 720p, or 1080i, the HD-PVR comes with an IR blaster that communicates with your cable or satellite set-top box for automated program recordings and channel-changing capabilities. In 2012, Hauppauge released the HD-PVR Gaming Edition 2, which features a much smaller design than its predecessor along with 1080p HDMI support. The PVR is not officially supported on Macintosh systems, but a variety of third-party programs exist that allow it to function on OS X, including EyeTV by Elgato and HDPVRCapture. In 2013, Hauppauge released an upgrade for the existing HD-PVR 2 with the HD-PVR 2 Gaming Edition Plus, which supports Macintosh systems.

===WinTV Analogue===
The standard analogue range of products use software encoding for recording analogue TV. The more recent Hauppauge cards use SoftPVR, which allows MPEG and MPEG-2 encoding in software provided that a sufficiently fast CPU is installed in the system.

===MediaMVP===
The MediaMVP is a thin client device that displays music, video and pictures (hence &quot;MVP&quot;) on a television. It is based on an IBM PowerPC RISC processor specialized for multimedia decoding. The operating system is a form of Linux, and everything (including the menus) is served to the device via Ethernet or, on newer devices, 802.11g wireless LAN from the server PC.

Various open source software products can use the device as a front-end. An example is MVPMC, which allows the MediaMVP to be used as a front-end for MythTV or ReplayTV.

===Table of products===
===WinTV software===

Hauppauge&#x27;s principal software offering is WinTV, a TV tuning, viewing, and recording application supplied on a CD-ROM included with tuner hardware. A previous version was called WinTV2000 (WinTV32 without skins). It had companion applications, including WinTV Scheduler, which performs timed recordings, and WinTV Radio, which receives FM radio. It was modified towards a service-based software package, with card management and recordings taken care of by the &quot;TV Server&quot; service and EPG data collection by the &quot;EPG Service&quot;, allowing WinTV2000 to work with multiple Hauppauge tuners in the same PC.

In 2007 Hauppauge launched WinTV Version 6, followed in 2009 by WinTV7. WinTV8 was current . WinTV updates are available without charge to Hauppauge tuner users (major updates require access to a qualifying earlier WinTV installation CD, e.g. WinTV8 requires a CD not earlier than WinTV7). An option available at extra cost, WinTV Extend, allows TV to be streamed over the Internet to several portable devices such as smartphones, and PCs.

===Wing===
&quot;Wing&quot;, a supplemental software application from Hauppauge, allows the company&#x27;s PVR products to convert MPEG recordings into formats suitable for playback on the Apple iPod, Sony PSP or a DivX player; it converts MPEG-2 videos into H.264, MPEG-4 and DivX.

===Third-party software===
Third-party programs which support Hauppauge tuners include: GB-PVR, InterVideo WinDVR, Snapstream&#x27;s Beyond TV, SageTV, Windows Media Center and the Linux-based MythTV.

===Linux===
Hauppauge offers limited support for Linux, with Ubuntu repositories and firmware downloads available on its website. There are drivers available from non-Hauppauge sources for most of the company&#x27;s cards (in IVTV and LinuxTV). It appears that some of these drivers (Nova and HVR) are written by a Hauppauge engineer.

The PVR-150 captures video on Linux, but there are reportedly difficulties getting the remote control and IR blaster to work. Also, a January 2007 product substitution of HVR-1600 in PVR-150 retail boxes forced many Linux users to exchange their purchases because the Linux driver has not been updated for the HVR-1600.

SageTV Media Center for Linux supports PVR-150, PVR-250, PVR-350, PVR-500 and MediaMVP.

For ATSC and DVB applications, a list of Linux supported Hauppauge and other makes of TV cards can be found on the LinuxTVWiki page (see &quot;Supported Hardware&quot; section).

<text>The 1963 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 26 May 1963. It was race 1 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 100-lap race was won by British driver Graham Hill driving a BRM P57 after Jim Clark retired from the lead with a broken gearbox on lap 78. 

Clark took pole position for the event ahead of Hill and John Surtees. The two BRM drivers, Hill and Richie Ginther, led the opening laps in first and second respectively. Clark overtook Ginther for second on lap 5, and Hill for the lead on lap 18. Surtees was also able to overtake Ginther and Hill into second by lap 56, before Hill re-overtook him. Surtees then fell back. Clark retired on lap 78 with a gearbox failure, allowing Hill to win the race, with Ginther and Bruce McLaren completing the podium. Surtees, suffering from his mechanical issue, finished fourth.

<text>The 1963 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race, held at Spa-Francorchamps on 9 June 1963. It was race 2 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Jim Clark won the race in extremely wet and rainy conditions. After starting eighth on the grid, Clark passed all the cars in front of him, including early leader Graham Hill. At the end of the race, Clark had not only lapped the entire field except for Bruce McLaren, but the margin to the second-placed Cooper driver was almost five minutes. The Scot&#x27;s performance was made even more impressive by the fact that gearbox issues meant that he had to hold his gear lever in place, thus driving one-handed, whenever fifth gear was selected on this high-speed circuit. Given the rainy conditions, Clark eventually chose not to engage fifth gear at all, leaving him with only four gears. This would be the first of seven victories for Clark and Team Lotus that year.

<doc id="1122266" wikidata="Q114347" url="?curid=1122266" title="César Ritz">
<text>César Ritz, born Cäsar Ritz (23 February 1850 – 26 October 1918), was a Swiss hotelier and founder of several hotels, most famously the Hôtel Ritz in Paris and the Ritz and Carlton Hotels in London (the forerunners of the modern Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company). He was an early hotel chain founder known as &quot;King of Hoteliers, and Hotelier to Kings,&quot; and it is from his name and that of his hotels that the term &quot;ritzy&quot; derives.

==Early life==
Ritz was born in the Swiss village of Niederwald, the youngest of 13 children in a poor peasant family. At the age of twelve he was sent as a boarder to the Jesuit college at Sion, and at fifteen, having shown only vaguely artistic leanings, was apprenticed as a sommelier at a hotel in Brig. While working there as an apprentice wine waiter he was dismissed by the patron of the hotel from his position, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ll never make anything of yourself in the hotel business. It takes a special knack, a special flair, and it&#x27;s only right that I tell you the truth—you haven&#x27;t got it.&quot; He returned briefly to the Jesuits as a sacristan, then left to seek his fortune in Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.

==Early career==
Ritz&#x27;s formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870–71 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a maître d&#x27;hôtel, manager, and eventually hotelier. After a short stint working at the Hôtel de la Fidélité, he worked as a waiter in a workman&#x27;s bistro and took a position in a &quot;prix fixe&quot; restaurant owned by the Chevallier family, where he was later dismissed for breaking too many dishes in his desire to work briskly. He worked his way up from assistant waiter to restaurant manager of a restaurant on the corner of Rue Royale and Rue Saint-Honore, before working at the high-class Restaurant Voisin between 1869 and 1872. Here he waited on the likes of Sarah Bernhardt, George Sand, Edmond de Goncourt, Théophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas, learned the essentials of his trade from the owner, Bellenger, and served up dishes such as elephant&#x27;s trunk in sauce chasseur as supplies of fresh meat dwindled during the siege and zoo animals took their place.

In 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the Hôtel Splendide in Paris, which was one of the most lavish hotels in Europe at the time, where he met many rich, self-made Americans as guests who had a profound effect on him. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the World&#x27;s Fair, by which time he had begun to acquire a considerable knowledge of the industry and the culinary preferences of esteemed people such as the Prince of Wales.

==First managership==
In the winter of 1873 his career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand Hôtel in Nice. He once stated that his &quot;years of wandering in the wake of a migratory society had begun&quot;. While working as manager at the Rigi Kulm Hotel in Switzerland, an incident occurred that changed his career. The central heating at the hotel broke during a frigid day, and a group of 40 were arriving for lunch. Ritz changed the menu to hot dishes, moved a table into the smaller drawing room, and heated 40 bricks in the oven to be wrapped in flannel cloths placed at the footstool of each guest. This quick thinking was noticed by Max Pfyffer, the designer of the Grand Hotel National in Lucerne, who noted his efficiency in a scrapbook.

Regular moves then followed, usually twice a year just ahead of the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer. He had a period working as the maître d&#x27;hôtel of the Grand Hôtel in Locarno on Lake Maggiore, a difficult period given the eccentricities of its alcoholic manager who lived on a diet of raw ham, bread, and wine and had a habit of disturbing the guests, ringing bells at 5a.m. and chasing his wife through the corridors with an army pistol. Ritz meekly commented that &quot;I did what I could to pacify the clients&quot; in the circumstances.
In 1878, he became the manager of the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand Hôtel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development and management of luxury hotels, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and quickly gained a reputation for good taste and elegance, and by the mid-1880s the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne had earned a reputation as the most elegant hotel in Europe. Ritz was the first to mandate that &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. His code was &quot;See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked.&quot;

According to his widow, Ritz also was a pioneer of hygiene and cleanliness in his hotels. He decorated without heavy draperies and wallpaper and replaced them with washable paint and lighter washable fabrics. In 1887 Ritz bought the Hôtel de Provence in Cannes and the Restaurant de la Conversation and Minerva Hotel in Baden-Baden.

==Ritz and Escoffier==
In 1888, he opened the Conservations Haus restaurant with Auguste Escoffier as chef in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as &quot;a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London&quot;. The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele headed by the Prince of Wales, including the British and European royal families.

According to Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin, &quot;the outstanding success of the Savoy owed everything to the civilized genius of César Ritz and his brilliant chef, Auguste Escoffier, who introduced the English to the subtlety and delicacy of French haute cuisine and invented at the Savoy many celebrated dishes, including Peche Melba and the thin toast named after the same singer&quot;. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now &quot;seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms.&quot;

Ritz campaigned with Henry Labouchère, Lord Randolph Churchill, and others to &quot;alter licensing laws whereby restaurants could not open on Sundays and had to close at 11pm on other nights.&quot; In March 1898, Ritz was sacked from the Savoy for fraud. He was implicated in the disappearance of more than £3,400 of wine and spirits, as well as in receiving kickbacks from suppliers. In a 1938 biography of her husband, Ritz&#x27;s widow maintained that he resigned. According to a damning report by the Savoy&#x27;s auditors, Carte handed Ritz, Escoffier and Louis Echenard (Ritz&#x27; deputy) letters of dismissal.

Ritz threatened to sue the hotel company for wrongful dismissal but was evidently dissuaded by Escoffier, who felt that their interests would be better served by keeping the scandal quiet. Lady de Grey sided with Ritz; she cancelled her party at the Savoy on learning of his sacking, stating &quot;Where Ritz goes, I go&quot;. Ritz subsequently established a Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, built in 1897–99 under the designs of C.J. Phipps. Bombed in World War II, the hotel was later replaced by New Zealand House in 1959.

==Ritz hotels==
Ritz would go on to find investors and open a number of his own hotels. By the late 1890s, Ritz was an extremely busy man, with hotel enterprises in Rome, Frankfurt, Salsomaggiore, Palermo, Biarritz, Wiesbaden, Monte Carlo, Lucerne and Menton and projects in Madrid, Cairo and Johannesburg. According to his wife, &quot;César&#x27;s suitcases were never completely unpacked; he was always either just arriving from or departing upon a new journey&quot;.

In 1896, he formed the Ritz Hotel syndicate with South African millionaire Alfred Beit, reputedly the wealthiest man in the world at the time. They opened what would become the celebrated Hôtel Ritz in the Place Vendôme, Paris, late in 1898. At the inauguration, on 1 June 1898, were many figures of the European elite, including Lady de Grey, the Duke and Duchess de Rohan, Calouste Gulbenkian, and Marcel Proust. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1905, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era for the rich and famous. The Ritz Hotel in Madrid, opened in 1906, inspired by King Alfonso XIII&#x27;s desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the now-famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.

==Later life==
The hotelier himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.

By 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913, he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake Küssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at Küssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, César Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.

<text>The 1963 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 30 June 1963. It was race 4 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Jim Clark driving a Lotus 25-Climax 1.5 litre V8.

== Race report ==
Jim Clark took the lead at the start from Richie Ginther in the BRM. All Graham Hill&#x27;s hard work in qualifying second despite mechanical problems in practice came to nothing when his engine died on the grid and his car had to be push started. The subsequent one-minute penalty dropped him well back. Clark led dominantly, his lead being extended when a stone pierced Ginther&#x27;s radiator, forcing him into the pits. Jack Brabham took second place after a strong fight with Trevor Taylor, who also suffered mechanical problems.

Brabham then began to gain significantly on Clark as the Scot&#x27;s Climax engine started to splutter, however this proved to be a sporadic fault and he had enough of a lead to maintain the position. Brabham himself was delayed when an ignition lead came loose, handing second and third to Tony Maggs and a delighted Hill. Clark was over a minute ahead of them after yet another start-to-finish victory. Graham Hill was push started, incurring a one-minute penalty from the organisers, and was awarded no championship points for his third place. By finishing 7th, at 19 years and 345 days old, Chris Amon became the youngest driver to finish a world championship race. This record would hold for another 38 years, until it was broken by Fernando Alonso at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix.

== Classification ==
=== Qualifying ===
===Race===
* Phil Hill was originally entered as car #24, to drive the ATS. When the ATS team withdrew, he switched to drive the Scuderia Filipinetti Lotus-BRM.

== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for British driver Peter Arundell.
* This was the 100th Formula One World Championship race where a British driver participated. By 1963, Great Britain was the most successful nation in Formula One. Of those 100 races, British drivers had won 39, had 95 podiums, 38 pole positions, 43 fastest laps and 3 World Championships. Only Argentinians had more World Championships - by courtesy of Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s five titles - but by the end of 1965 the British drivers would surpass that record as well.

<text>The 1963 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 4 August 1963. It was race 6 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 15-lap race was won by Ferrari driver John Surtees after he started from second position. Jim Clark finished second for the Lotus team and BRM driver Richie Ginther came in third.

== Race report == 
Jim Clark led away from pole in his customary fashion. Behind him Lorenzo Bandini spun in front of Innes Ireland who collected him, Willy Mairesse had an accident, and Chris Amon sustained a knee injury when the steering broke, catapulting him into the trees. Graham Hill retired leaving Clark to battle away with John Surtees and Trevor Taylor before engine problems befell Taylor. When Clark&#x27;s engine went down to just 7 cylinders, Surtees was able to pass him easily to lead him home to take his first F1 victory. Richie Ginther completed the podium. Gerhard Mitter finished in a superb fourth place in his home race from Jim Hall and Jo Bonnier.

This race was notable for being the only time Jim Clark ever finished second in a World Championship race, as well the only race of the season won by a non-British team.

<text>The Fatima Mansions were an Irish rock band formed in 1988 by Cork singer/keyboardist Cathal Coughlan, formerly of Microdisney.

==Career==
The original line-up consisted of Coughlan, Nick Allum, Jonathan Fell, Zac Woolhouse and Aindrias O&#x27;Gruama. They took their name from the Fatima Mansions corporation flats in Rialto, Dublin.

The Fatima Mansions were a popular live band, and gained indie chart success with their albums &quot;Viva Dead Ponies&quot;, &quot;Bertie&#x27;s Brochures&quot;, &quot;Valhalla Avenue&quot; and &quot;Lost in the Former West&quot;.

They entered the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in 1992 with a heavily reworked version of Bryan Adams&#x27; song &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, taken from an &quot;NME&quot; tribute album in aid of the charity, the Spastics Society. The single was a double A-side; the flip-track, Manic Street Preachers&#x27; version of &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; received most of the radio airplay.
They also gained mainstream exposure by opening a European leg of U2&#x27;s Zoo TV Tour in 1992, although they were nearly booed off the stage and almost started a riot when front man Coughlan swore at a Milan audience and insulted the Pope. The band often courted controversy with religion, dictators, empires and general authority being targets for Coughlan&#x27;s vitriol. Despite this, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper described him as &quot;the most underrated lyricist in pop today&quot;, and DJ John Peel said he could &quot;listen to Cathal Coughlan sing the phone book&quot;.

The album and singles campaign for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Former West&quot; was styled on the glamour of Liberace, and featured a cover version of The Walker Brothers&#x27;s &quot;Nite Flights&quot;.

<text>Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour (c. 15607 November 1639) was the eldest son of Sir Matthew Arundell of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (ca. 1532/1534 – 24 December 1598), and Margaret Willoughby, the daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby, of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Lady Anne Grey, the youngest daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. He distinguished himself in battle against the Ottoman Turks in the service of the Emperor Rudolf II, and was created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. His assumption of the title displeased Queen Elizabeth, who refused to recognize it, and imprisoned him in the Fleet Prison. In 1605 Arundell was created 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour. In the same year, he was briefly suspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot.

==Life==
Sir Thomas Arundell (c. 15607 November 1639) was the eldest son of Sir Matthew Arundell of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (ca. 1532/1534 – 24 December 1598), a member of the ancient family of Arundell of Cornwall, and Margaret Willoughby, the daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby, of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Lady Anne Grey, the youngest daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. His father inherited extensive former monastic lands, and served in a number of administrative capacities, including high sheriff, custos rotulorum, and Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset. In her youth his mother served for several years in the household of Princess Elizabeth at Hatfield. Arundell&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Arundell (executed on 26 February 1552) and Margaret Howard (ca. 1515 – 10 October 1571), sister of Queen Katherine Howard. According to Agnes Strickland, Margaret Howard, Lady Arundel was a Lady Attendant to Katherine Howard, her sister the Queen.

In 1580 Arundell was imprisoned for his fervent Roman Catholicism. By licence dated 18 June 1585 he married Mary (c. 1567 – 1607), the daughter of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, and Mary, the daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague. Arundell&#x27;s wife was the sister of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Arundell was fond of Southampton as a youth, writing to Lord Burghley when Southampton was 15 that &#x27;Your Lordship doth love him&#x27;, and that &#x27;My [own] love and care of this young Earl enticeth me&#x27;.

Although a Roman Catholic throughout his life, Arundell demonstrated his loyalty to the Crown in 1588 by subscribing £100 towards the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

According to Akrigg, Arundell was &#x27;gifted and scholarly&#x27;, but by the time he had reached his 30s had failed to find any outlet for his talents and had &#x27;sunk into a melancholic existence&#x27;, living a &#x27;studious solitary life&#x27; at the Wriothesley estates in Hampshire or in the family apartments at Southampton House in London. In 1595 Arundell&#x27;s father agreed to provide him with horses and £1100 to leave England and serve in the Imperial forces against the Turks. The Queen allegedly recommended him to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. On 7 September 1595 Arundell stormed the breach at Gran, replacing the Turkish standard with the Imperial eagle. In recognition of his service, Arundell was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire on 14 December 1595, and became known as &#x27;the Valiant&#x27;.

Against his father&#x27;s wishes, Arundell took his leave of the Imperial court in mid-December and returned to England. His ship was caught in a storm and wrecked near Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast. He lost all his belongings in the wreck, and counted himself fortunate to stand &#x27;extreamely cold &amp; wett upon the shore&#x27;. His assumption of a foreign title created jealousy among his fellow peers in England, and was resented by his father, who objected to his superior rank and disinherited him. The Queen was furious and threatened to make him renounce the title. She committed Arundell to the Fleet Prison, remarking that &#x27;I would not have a sheep branded with another man&#x27;s mark&#x27;. Arundell remained under arrest until mid-April 1597, when he was freed, but forbidden to appear at court. In the following months he made frequent appeals to the Queen, but was still denied her favour, and again fell prey to depression. In July his father grudgingly allowed Arundell to live with him at Wardour provided that he not bring his wife with him.

In 1597 Arundell was arrested on vague suspicions of Catholic espionage. The authorities searched his chamber but could prove nothing against him, and released him to his father&#x27;s custody on the grounds of his wife&#x27;s failing health. Arundell&#x27;s father &#x27;insisted on behaving as a jailer&#x27;, and Arundell was eventually transferred elsewhere.

Arundell succeeded his father in December 1598. In 1601, his brother-in-law, Southampton, was on trial for his part in the Essex Rebellion of 8 February 1601. Attempting to distance himself from Southampton&#x27;s misfortune, Arundell wrote a &#x27;treacherous&#x27; letter on 18 February to Sir Robert Cecil, protesting that Southampton&#x27;s &#x27;ears were hardened against wholesome counsel, for which I thought good to estrange myself from him&#x27;.

In March 1605 Arundell and Southampton sent Captain George Weymouth to found a colony in Virginia. The colonists arrived back in England in mid-July. According to the account written by James Rosier, these were the colonists &#x27;we were to leave in the Country by their agreement with my Lord the Right Honourable Count Arundell&#x27;. According to Akrigg, Arundell figures much more prominently in Rosier&#x27;s account than Southampton, leading Akrigg to conclude that &#x27;the whole voyage may best be regarded as a first attempt to found an American colony that would be an asylum for English Catholics&#x27;, and that Arundell, who in 1596 had planned a venture to the East Indies, was the principal impetus behind the Weymouth voyage.

On 4 May 1605 King James I created him Baron Arundell of Wardour. Appointed by the new King as colonel of the English regiment serving the Archduke in Spanish Flanders, Arundell made an unauthorized crossing to the continent in September 1605, disobeying royal orders and incurring the King&#x27;s anger. A few months later he was named by Guy Fawkes under torture, and briefly suspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot.

In 1607 Arundell&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Thomas, married Blanche Somerset, the daughter of the Earl of Worcester, without Arundell&#x27;s consent, resulting in an estrangement between father and son. Arundell&#x27;s first wife, Mary, died a few weeks after the marriage. On 1 July 1608 Arundell remarried. His second wife was Anne Philipson, the daughter of Miles Philipson, of Crook, Westmorland, and Barbara Sandys, sister of Francis Sandys, of Conishead, Lancashire. She died on 28 June 1637 at Lennox House in London, and was buried on 4 July 1637 at Tisbury, Wiltshire.

During the 1630s Arundell engaged in &#x27;acrimonious religious disputes&#x27; with the Bishop of Durham, and in 1637 attempted to sell Wardour Castle to the King. He died at Wardour on 7 November 1639, and was buried at Tisbury.

==Marriages and issue==
Arundell married firstly Mary Wriothesley, by whom he had two sons and a daughter:
# Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour (c. 1586– 19 May 1643), who succeeded him.
# William Arundell of Horningsham, Wiltshire, who married Mary Browne, eldest daughter of Anthony Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montague (d.1629), by Jane Sackville, daughter of Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset. Before her marriage to William Arundell she was the wife of William Paulet (d.1621), Lord St. John, eldest son of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester.
# Elizabeth Mary Arundell (wife of Sir John Philpot).

Arundell&#x27;s first wife, Mary Wriothesley, was buried at Tisbury, Wiltshire, on 27 June 1607.

Arundell married secondly, Anne Philipson, third daughter of Miles Philipson of Crook, Westmorland, by whom he had:
# Matthew, (1609–1620) was thought in a theory of the early 1900s to have emigrated to Virginia and taken the name Howard, which theory was popularized by Harry Wright Newman in his 1933 first edition of Anne Arundel Gentry. Newman later retracted that in his second edition (1970) stating, &quot;In 1925 when research was being conducted on the Howards, I lent an ear to the story that he was Mathew Howard whose legal name was Arundel, but changed it to Howard for political reasons. Furthermore, he was descended from an immediate line of the Duke of Norfolk. See &#x27;Anne Arundel Gentry&#x27;, 1st Ed. All claims since have been found to have little foundation.&quot; The theory that Matthew Arundell was Matthew Howard was disproved in 1939, by showing that Matthew Arundell was buried on 2 June 1620 in London.
# Thomas
# Frederick
# Katherine (wife of Ralph Eure)
# Mary (wife of Sir John Somerset) (and namesake for Somerset County in the Province of Maryland, erected 1666)
# Ann, (namesake for Anne Arundel County, erected 1650). She later married Cecilius Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, (1605–1675) in 1628 at age 13. In 1632, after the death of his father George, (1579–1632), the first Lord Baltimore, and late loyal friend and Secretary of State, King Charles I renewed the grant originally made to his father, with the proprietorship of Maryland after an earlier unsuccessful colony of Avalon in Newfoundland. Anne Arundel County (misspelt), erected 1650 in the Province and later the State of Maryland is named after Calvert&#x27;s (second Lord Baltimore&#x27;s) wife, Ann Arundell. She was born in 1615 at Arundel Castle, gave birth to nine children (three survive to adulthood, with three sons and six daughters) before her death at age 34 on 23 July 1649, and was also buried at Tisbury, Wiltshire.
# Frances (wife of John Talbot, 10th Earl of Shrewsbury)
# Margaret (wife of John Fortescue)
# Clare (wife of Humphrey Weld).

<text>The 1963 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 8 September 1963. It was the seventh of ten races in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. At this race, Scottish driver Jim Clark clinched the World Championship crown with three races to go, the first time anyone had done so.

The organisers had planned to run on the full 10 km circuit but the very bumpy (and in some places ruined) nature of the banked concrete curves provoked much criticism and also caused accidents. Therefore, at the drivers&#x27; request, for the next day it was decided to revert to the 5.75 km road layout.

This race was Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s 100th start in a World Championship event as a team. Jim Clark became the first driver to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 3 races left to go. Lotus-Climax also won the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

== Classification ==
=== Qualifying ===
;Notes
* – Only 20 cars were permitted to take the start. Chris Amon&#x27;s practice accident left him hospitalised, leaving him unable to take the start. This would have promoted Mário de Araújo Cabral, who was 21st in qualifying, onto the starting grid. However, on race day, Giancarlo Baghetti, who was 25th quickest in qualifying, lined up on the starting grid. A race report from the time speculated that this was as a result of the race organisers arranging for Baghetti to start so there could be an additional Italian driver in the race.

<text>The 1963 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 6, 1963, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 8 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 110-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill after he started from pole position. His teammate Richie Ginther finished second and Lotus driver Jim Clark came in third.

==Summary==
By the time the teams – including Ferrari for the first time at Watkins Glen – came to America, Jim Clark had wrapped up the Driver&#x27;s Championship with five wins in seven races. At The Glen, however, the day belonged to Graham Hill and BRM, as Hill started from the pole and won by more than half a minute over American teammate Richie Ginther. Hill owed much of his success to Clark&#x27;s dead battery on the dummy grid (used for the first time in F1), and the failure of John Surtees&#x27;s Ferrari engine while leading with 30 laps to go.

In the first hour of qualifying on Friday, Clark&#x27;s Lotus equalled his lap record of 1:15.0 from the previous year. Hill and Surtees were right on the Scot&#x27;s pace, as well, and all three were soon under 1:14. At one point, Hill&#x27;s BRM jumped out of gear on the back straight and left the track, skipping through the woods without hitting any trees, but at the end of the session, he was fastest at 1:13.4. Jack Brabham was glad just to be at the circuit, after he was unable to find a rental car or a taxi at the airport in Elmira, twenty miles (32 km) away, and ended up hitchhiking to the track with his baggage and racing gear!

On Saturday, Canadian Peter Broeker&#x27;s Stebro (running a four-cylinder Ford with compared to almost 200 for the Climax and BRM V8&#x27;s) dumped oil all around the circuit. The session was stopped for 30 minutes to clean up, but conditions were never again good enough for anyone to better their Friday times, so the top six were Graham Hill, Clark, Surtees, Ginther, and the Brabhams of Sir Jack and Dan Gurney. In addition to Ginther and Gurney, the grid contained five other Americans – Masten Gregory, Phil Hill, Jim Hall, Hap Sharp and Rodger Ward – the most ever in a Formula One field, as well as Mexican Pedro Rodríguez, who was making his Formula One debut.

Race day was bright and clear with a record crowd of nearly 60,000. A dummy grid was used for the first time in a Championship Grand Prix, and when the field moved forward to the starting grid, Clark&#x27;s Lotus remained still. At the flag, Hill led Ginther, Surtees, Gurney, Tony Maggs, Gregory and Brabham up the hill and through the Esses. The Lotus crew discovered that Clark&#x27;s battery was dead, and by the time they replaced it, Broeker&#x27;s Stebro, trailing the field, was already into his second lap.

Surtees made the first move, getting by Ginther to split the BRM&#x27;s, and then, on lap seven, taking the lead from Hill. Gurney followed him and took second briefly, before surrendering the spot back to Hill. By lap 15, Clark was up into 14th place with his engine still not sounding entirely right.

Hill began pushing Surtees on lap 30. He got by to take the lead after shadowing for two laps, gave it back, took it again two laps later, and finally surrendered it again, settling into the Ferrari&#x27;s slipstream. On lap 43, Gurney suddenly slowed and then retired from third place with fuel starvation and a chassis failure, moving Clark up to seventh.

After trailing Surtees closely for some time, Hill lost his tow when his anti-roll bar came loose and the BRM&#x27;s handling changed abruptly. Fighting severe understeer, he began throwing the car into turns to slide the rear end around, flinging stones off the curbs and losing ground to the leading Ferrari. On lap 82, with no threat to his lead, Surtees&#x27;s engine lost power, and he cruised into the pits to retire. &quot;I was just hanging on to him,&quot; Hill said afterward. &quot;He&#x27;s a very tricky driver. He was gaining a half-second each lap on me until he went out. I think it was a good measure of the difference in our two cars.&quot; Suddenly in the lead again, with only Ginther on the same lap, Hill backed off and set his sights on bringing the car home.

The Englishman drove under the flag 34 seconds ahead of teammate Ginther, repeating BRM&#x27;s season-opening sweep at Monaco. New World Champion Clark took the final podium spot when he overtook Brabham, whose engine had been misfiring for much of the race. It was Hill&#x27;s first American win, but one that he would repeat in 1964 and 1965.

== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for Mexican driver and future Grand Prix winner Pedro Rodríguez and for Canadian driver Peter Broeker.
* It was also the debut for Stebro as the first Canadian constructor and for Ford as an engine supplier.
* For the 52nd consecutive time and since the 1958 Argentine Grand Prix had a Coventry Climax-powered car finished in the Top-10. It therefore broke the record previously set at the 1957 German Grand Prix by Ferrari of 51 consecutive races finishing in the Top-10.

<text>Paulin Jidenu Hountondji (11 April 1942 – 2 February 2024) was a Beninese philosopher, politician and academic considered one of the most important figures in the history of African philosophy. From the 1970s onwards, he taught at the Université Nationale du Bénin in Cotonou, where he was Professor of Philosophy. In the early 1990s he briefly served as Minister of Education and Minister for Culture and Communications in the Government of Benin.

==Education and career==
Paulin J. Hountondji was educated at the École Normale Supérieure, Paris, graduating in 1966, and taking his doctorate in 1970 (his thesis was on Edmund Husserl). After two years teaching in Besançon (France), Kinshasa and Lubumbashi (Democratic Republic of the Congo), he accepted a post at the Université Nationale du Bénin in Cotonou, where he long taught as Professor of Philosophy.

His academic career was interrupted, however, by a period spent in politics. Having been a prominent critic of the military dictatorship that had ruled his country, Hountondji became involved in Benin&#x27;s return to democracy (in 1992), and served in the government as Minister of Education and Minister for Culture and Communications until his resignation and return to the University in 1994.

Hountondji was until his death director of the African Centre for Advanced Studies in Porto-Novo, Benin, and served as the Bingham Professor of Humanities from 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008 at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.

In 1999, Hountondji was honoured with a Prince Claus Award from the Prince Claus Fund, an international culture and development organisation based in Amsterdam.

==Philosophical work==
Hountondji&#x27;s philosophical influences include two of his teachers in Paris, Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida. His reputation rests primarily on his critical work concerning the nature of African philosophy. His main target was the ethnophilosophy of writers such as Placide Tempels and Alexis Kagame. He argued that such an approach confuses the methods of anthropology with those of philosophy, producing &quot;a hybrid discipline without a recognizable status in the world of theory&quot; ([1997], p. 52). Part of the problem stems from the fact that ethnophilosophy is in large part a response to Western views of African thought; this polemical role works against its philosophical validity.

His approach widened somewhat in later work; he still rejected ethnophilosophy as a genuine philosophical discipline, but he had moved towards more of a synthesis of traditional African thought and rigorous philosophical method. He defended that thesis until his last days.

==Death==
Hountondji died in Cotonou on 2 February 2024, at the age of 81.

<text>Umeå IK () is a women&#x27;s professional association football club based in the city of Umeå, in northern Sweden, and currently playing Damallsvenskan, the first tier of women&#x27;s football in Sweden.

They were one of the most successful football clubs in the world in the early 2000s, winning seven Swedish championships between 2000 and 2008, four Swedish Cups (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2007) and the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League twice, in 2003 and 2004. They also reached the Champions League finals in 2002, 2007 and 2008. A number of Swedish and international stars played for the club during that period, most notably Brazilian star Marta.

Umeå IK play their home games at Umeå Energi Arena (formerly known as Gammliavallen) in Umeå. The team colours are black and yellow. The club is affiliated to the Västerbottens Fotbollförbund.

== History == 
Established in 1917 as a general sports club, the women&#x27;s football
section began competing in 1985 in the Swedish fourth division. In 1986, they won the division and were promoted to the third division. In 1991, the club began paying its players, 35kr per game, and implemented a more regular training schedule than other Swedish teams in the hopes of turning the team into a European contender.

In 1996 the team reached the Premier Division (Damallsvenskan) only to be relegated the following year. In 1998 they were promoted again. The years following the second promotion saw an enormous success for the club, winning seven Swedish championships in 9 years (2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008). In the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, five out of the starting eleven on the silver medal-winning Swedish national team played for Umeå IK. In 2004, Brazilian star Marta signed with the club. The club went unbeaten in the 2006 Damallsvenskan season.

After their last championship title in 2008, the club&#x27;s fortunes faltered, with several high-profile players leaving and the club being forced to restructure itself to avoid bankruptcy in 2011. The re-organisation, however, was not enough to reverse the direction of the club, and after a tumultuous 2016 season which included going a month without a head coach, the club finished last in the league, and was relegated to the second division. They would spend the next three years in Elitettan before being promoted back to the top flight in 2019.

After finishing in eleventh in the 2020 Damallsvenskan season, the club was relegated again, only a year after their return to the top flight. A few days after the end of the season, head coach Robert Bergström announced his resignation after four years with the club.

During the upcoming season, the team played in Elitettan, and on 9 October 2021, Umeå IK defeated IF Brommapojkarna 6–2 on home soil and qualified for the 2022 Damallsvenskan. On 5 November 2022, Umeå IK was again relegated from Damallsvenskan.

<text>The 1963 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca in Mexico City on 27 October 1963. It was race 9 of 10 in both the 1963 World Championship of Drivers and the 1963 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

Jim Clark dominated the race from pole position, a time that was 1.7 seconds faster than anybody else. Mexico was considered one of his most successful venues. His fastest lap of the race eclipsed his pole time by 0.7 seconds, and he lapped the entire field except for second and third behind him. He eventually scored a total of five pole positions, four fastest laps and three victories at the venue in his Formula One career. This was also his sixth win, his sixth fastest lap, and his sixth pole position of the nine races completed in 1963.

This was also the only World Championship Grand Prix where a car raced with the number 13 until Pastor Maldonado selected the number as his permanent race number in 2014.

<doc id="1122303" wikidata="Q816579" url="?curid=1122303" title="Ben Olsen">
<text>Benjamin Robert Olsen (born May 3, 1977) is an American sports executive, soccer coach, and former professional player who was formerly the president of Washington Spirit, a professional women&#x27;s soccer club in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). He is currently the head coach of Houston Dynamo FC in Major League Soccer. Olsen is best known for his long-term association with D.C. United of Major League Soccer (MLS), first as a player then as a coach.

Born in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Olsen grew up playing for FC Delco, an elite club program near Philadelphia. He then played for Virginia Cavaliers men&#x27;s soccer and was named 1997 Soccer America Player of the Year.

Olsen spent the vast majority of his professional career in the United States with D.C. United in Major League Soccer, which he joined straight out of college. Over the course of 12 seasons with United, Olsen made 221 appearances, scoring 29 goals and making 49 assists. During that time he won two MLS Cup titles, two MLS Supporters&#x27; Shields and one U.S. Open Cup winners medal. His individual honors include two-time MLS All-Star, 1998 MLS Rookie of the Year, MLS Cup &#x27;99 MVP and 2007 MLS Best XI.

Olsen also earned 37 caps with the United States men&#x27;s national team, winning the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup and representing the United States at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Olsen announced his retirement from professional competition on November 24, 2009.

==Youth and college soccer==
Olsen grew up in Middletown, Pennsylvania. He played his youth soccer for premier team FC Delco, where he was inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Olsen attended Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary School and Middletown Area High School, where he was named &quot;Parade&quot; magazine&#x27;s National High School Player of the Year in 1993.

Olsen was motivated to play college soccer at the University of Virginia because the team had just won four NCAA Division I Championships and was coached by Bruce Arena, who had previously coached Olsen when he was 14 to 15 years old. While at UVA the Cavaliers won two Final Fours and two ACC Men&#x27;s Soccer Tournaments with Olsen being honored as the ACC Tournament MVP in 1997. In that same year the Cavaliers advanced to the NCAA final after Olsen scored two goals to lift the Cavaliers 3–1 over the St. Louis Billikens in the semifinal round. In his three-year career he tallied 34 goals, 41 assists and 109 total points. During his junior year he was named the 1997 Soccer America Player of the Year.

==Professional career==
Olsen entered the league as a Project-40 player, and was allocated to D.C. United on December 27, 1997, shortly after finishing his junior season at UVA. In 1998 Olsen excelled as a right midfielder with United. During his inaugural season he earned a starting spot and scored 4 goals and made 8 assists. These accomplishments earned him the 1998 MLS Rookie of the Year Award and supported the team as it won the 1998 CONCACAF Champions Cup and 1998 InterAmerican Cup.

During Olsen&#x27;s second season with United he scored 5 goals and made 11 assists over 26 games, which contributed to United earning the 1999 Supporters&#x27; Shield on the way to winning MLS Cup &#x27;99. It was United&#x27;s third MLS Cup victory in the first four years of the league. Olsen, the game&#x27;s MVP, was especially happy to win the championship game after losing MLS Cup &#x27;98 to the Chicago Fire.
Olsen&#x27;s third season began well, but a collision with Chicago Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton caused an ankle injury that kept Ben out of much of the second half of the season, limiting him to 13 starts and only 1 goal and 3 assists on the year. After he recovered from the ankle injury in late 2000, Olsen was loaned by United to Nottingham Forest of the English First Division, where he immediately impressed and soon became a fan favorite. As a transfer became increasingly likely, Olsen severely fractured his ankle during a December game. During his 18-month absence Olsen required four surgeries and continuous rehabilitation. He finally returned in July 2002 and was able to finish the season with 7 starts and 10 games played.

In 2003 Olsen completed a full season with United for the first time in four years. He started 26 games for the team, while scoring 4 goals and making 7 assists. Although his speed was limited due to his injuries and surgeries, Olsen was able to adapt to a new position as a center midfielder. It was here that Olsen spent his time in 2004 as well, starting 25 games for United, scoring 3 goals and 4 assists. He scored 2 goals and 4 assists in 2005.

D.C. United needed Olsen back at wide midfielder for the 2007 season, and he responded well. He served as Captain when Jaime Moreno was away on national team duty, scored his first career hat trick in a 4–2 win over New York Red Bulls on June 10, and enjoyed his best season in MLS. He ended the year with seven goals and seven assists and was named to the MLS Best XI team. Olsen had surgery on both of his ankles in Baltimore on November 5, 2007.

Ankle problems again sidelined Olsen for the beginning of the 2008 MLS season, and there was speculation that his career was in jeopardy. Despite said problems, Ben Olsen was able to make one MLS appearance against the Los Angeles Galaxy on June 28, 2008. The crowd greeted him with the loudest ovation of the day and a tifo that read &quot;Ben Olsen&quot; and &quot;Heart Of A Lion&quot;. After playing just 15 minutes Olsen responded to the media by stating, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t great; I was like a wounded animal out there.&quot; On July 7, 2008, Olsen underwent another ankle surgery.

Olsen was able to continue his career during the 2009 season in a defensive midfield role, scoring the tying goal in stoppage time of a 1–1 tie with the New England Revolution. On May 2, 2009, Olsen injured himself during a game against FC Dallas, which led him to be substituted out during the second half. After skipping two matches he played against Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center on May 16, 2009. Six minutes into that match he aggravated his hamstring.
On July 17, 2012, United announced that Olsen would be inducted into the D.C. United Hall of Tradition before a match against the New England Revolution scheduled for September 15.

===Retirement===
United announced Olsen&#x27;s retirement from professional competition on October 24, 2009. Only three days earlier Olsen stated in an online chat hosted by The Washington Post that he was committed to playing another year. At the time of his retirement Olsen ranked second in games played, minutes played, game-winning goals, third in assists and shots on goal for United.

His retirement prompted numerous expressions of appreciation. On the same day he announced his retirement the Washington Wizards saluted Olsen at the end of the third quarter. In his honor the Wizards announced $14 tickets to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers, which reflected Olsen&#x27;s jersey number for United.
==International career==
Olsen at one time seemed like the right midfielder of the future for the U.S. national team, as he received his first cap soon after his Rookie of the Year season, on November 6, 1998, against Australia, and he was a significant player for the team in the 1999 season. He scored his first international goal during his first international start, which was against Chile on February 21, 1999. As the youngest player on the team. He received a cross from Brian McBride during the 58th minute. He then hit a side volley past goalie Marcelo Ramirez into the left corner of the goal. In 1999, he earned the U.S. Soccer Young Male Athlete of the Year award. However, the injuries that kept him out of club play also seriously damaged his aspirations for the national team.

Despite those injuries he was able to compete in the 2000 Summer Olympics for the United States, which placed fourth overall in the competition. Olsen&#x27;s third career international goal earned the United States a tie with Tunisia during an international friendly in preparation for World Cup qualifying. He scored in injury time when John O&#x27;Brien passed him the ball after a corner kick.

After moving to a controlling midfield position, Olsen was one of the selections on Bruce Arena&#x27;s 2006 FIFA World Cup roster, having scored goals in the U.S. team&#x27;s early 2006 win over Guatemala and in an April tie with Jamaica. Olsen earned 35 caps in all, scoring 6 goals for the United States. Olsen made his lone World Cup appearance against Ghana in a 2–1 loss, replacing an injured Claudio Reyna.

==Coaching career==
On January 5, 2010, United announced that Olsen would continue to work for United as an assistant coach under head coach Curt Onalfo. On August 5, following a league-worst 3–12–3 start to the season, head coach Curt Onlafo was fired. Subsequently, Olsen was named interim head coach and completed the season with a 3–8–1 record. Although United officials interviewed at least seven candidates, including Hertha Berlin manager Lucien Favre, the club appointed Olsen to the head coaching position. United made a public announcement on November 29, 2010, and held a press conference in the same room Olsen had announced his retirement one year and one month earlier. Olsen signed a three-year guaranteed contract that made him United&#x27;s seventh head coach in club history and youngest full-time head coach in the league&#x27;s 15-year history. This occurred despite the fact that United President and CEO Kevin Payne had continuously ruled him out during the months leading up to the decision.

In a promotion for the upcoming 2011 season, United gave away free half-smokes in conjunction with Ben&#x27;s Chili Bowl, which was renamed &quot;Ben Olsen&#x27;s Chili Bowl&quot; for one hour on March 17, 2011 .

In a largely disappointing 2013 season where United was last in the Eastern Division, Olsen led the team to the 2013 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final against Real Salt Lake. The team won on a first half stoppage time goal by Lewis Neal.

In 2014, Ben Olsen was named MLS Coach of the Year, helping D.C. United win the MLS Eastern Conference regular season title after finishing in last in 2013.

In 2019, Olsen became the youngest head coach in MLS to reach 100 wins as a manager, achieving the title at 41 years old.

On October 8, 2020, D.C. United announced that Ben Olsen departed from his role of head coach.

On November 8, 2022, Olsen was named head coach of Houston Dynamo.

==Personal life==
Olsen is a licensed minister and presided over the nuptials of his then-teammate, Nick Rimando, in 2005. He is married to Megan Schoen, a teacher at Takoma Park Middle School. The two wed in Negril, Jamaica in December 2006. Their wedding was featured in &quot;Brides&quot; magazine. Megan gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, on September 30, 2008.

The couple later featured in a popular TV commercial for Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, in which Olsen enjoys an impromptu soccer skills exhibition with fellow MLS players Brian Ching, Duilio Davino and Christian Gómez, before he and Megan chase their screen son, &quot;Dawson&quot;, out of the store when he has the temerity to ask for a David Beckham jersey.

Olsen has rented out the apartment below his Northwest, Washington, D.C. town house to numerous teammates, including to D.C. United goalkeeper Zach Wells during the 2008 season.

He was featured on the North American cover of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;.

<doc id="1122321" wikidata="Q385532" url="?curid=1122321" title="Spermatocele">
<text>Spermatocele is a fluid-filled cyst that develops in the epididymis. The fluid is usually a clear or milky white color and may contain sperm. Spermatoceles are typically filled with spermatozoa and they can vary in size from several millimeters to many centimeters. Small spermatoceles are relatively common, occurring in an estimated 30 percent of males. They are generally not painful. However, some people may experience discomfort such as a dull pain in the scrotum from larger spermatoceles. They are not cancerous, nor do they cause an increased risk of testicular cancer. Additionally, unlike varicoceles, they do not reduce fertility.
== History ==
&quot;Spermatocele&quot; is originally derived from the &quot;Greek&quot; term &quot;spermatos&quot; (sperm) and &quot;kele&quot; (cavity or mass). Oftentimes, &quot;epididymal cyst&quot; has been used interchangeably with &quot;spermatocele.&quot; However, it is important to note their differences. Epididymal cysts may appear anywhere along or within the epididymis and do not contain sperm, whereas spermatoceles may contain sperm. Epididymal cysts have been shown to occur more frequently in children before reaching puberty.

== Epidemiology ==
Spermatoceles usually affect men who are middle-aged and can, although rarely, affect children during puberty. The incidence rate is around 5-20% for children. It is estimated that approximately 30 percent of men have been diagnosed with small spermatoceles while less have larger spermatoceles. The incidence of spermatoceles increases as men age. Before puberty, children from the male sex may develop a similar benign mass called epididymis cyst. Although both epididymis cyst and spermatocele may be referred as the same, the epididymis cyst does not contain sperm and it can occur anywhere within the epididymis. It can be differentiated through an ultrasound imagining. Epididymis cysts larger than 10mm in diameter are recommended for surgery but if there is no problem then surgery is discouraged as it can affect fertility in the future.

=== Chronic infectious epididymitis ===
Chronic infectious epididymitis is rare. Some signs and symptoms include localized tenderness and swelling in the epididymis, which are different from any tenderness/abnormality present in the testis, these are usually not found in lower urinary tract. Chronic infectious epididymitis may be diagnosed in healthy adolescents as well as men. Some factors that predispose individuals to chronic infectious epididymitis include sexual activity, heavy physical exertion, and bicycle or motorcycle riding. Those diagnosed with chronic or recurrent epididymitis should receive a CT scan with contrast and a prostate ultrasonography to rule out structural abnormality of the urinary tract. If suspected to have chronic infectious epididymitis, one should consider getting a urinalysis, urine culture, and urine nucleic acid amplification tests for presence of &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;. Management of chronic infectious epididymitis is similar to management of acute infectious epididymitis, rarely does treatment extend to surgical management.

=== Chronic noninfectious epididymitis ===
Trauma, autoimmune disease, or vasculitis can cause chronic noninfectious epididymitis, but no clear cause or origin of the disease is found in most cases. Noninfectious epididymitis that happens spontaneously might be caused by the reflux of urine through the ejaculatory ducts and vas deferens into the epididymis, producing inflammation that leads to swelling and ductal obstruction. Men with history of vasectomy are also predisposed to chronic nonifectious epididymitis. Typical inciting factors include prolonged periods of sitting (long plane or car travel, sedentary desk jobs) or vigorous exercise (heavy lifting). Acute infectious epididymitis are often associated with more tenderness and swelling, whereas chronic noninfectious epididymitis tend to have less tenderness and swelling upon examination. Thorough past medical history and physical examination can help with determining the diagnosis. It is often that individuals with chronic noninfectious epididymitis will present with a history of a lack of symptom improvement while on antibiotic therapy. Management of chronic noninfectious epididymitis includes scrotal elevation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (unless unable to take for medical reasons), and it is recommended that individuals avoid physical activities that may cause said symptoms. Those with sedentary jobs or often experience prolonged periods of time sitting should practice physical mobility more frequently.

== Risk Factors ==
It is not well known what may be causing the growth of a spermatocele. It has been observed that pregnant women who were prescribed diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, and gave birth to a son most likely increased the risk of the son to develop a spermatocele in the future. However, doctors stopped prescribing this medication in 1971 since it increased the risk of women developing a rare vaginal cancer.

== Causes ==
Spermatoceles can originate as diverticulum from the tubules found in the head of the epididymis. Sperm accumulation gradually causes the diverticulum to increase in size, causing a spermatocele. While there are many tubules connecting the epididymis to the testis, a blockage in one of the tubules may lead to formation of a cyst. In many instances they appear to occur spontaneously without any preceding instances of injury.

Scarring of any part of the epididymis due to trauma or inflammation can cause it to become obstructed and in turn form a spermatocele.

==Diagnosis==
Spermatoceles can be discovered as incidental scrotal masses found on physical examination by a physician or by self-inspection of the scrotum and testicles. The various types of diagnosis for spermatocele types include hydrocele, varicocele, hernia, simple epididymal cyst, and neoplasm.

The primary care physician may diagnose and manage benign causes of scrotal masses such as hydrocele, varicocele and spermatocele. However, if a &quot;must not miss&quot; diagnosis related to testicular masses such as testicular torsion, epididymitis, acute orchitis, strangulated hernia and testicular cancer is suspected, the family physician must refer to a urologist.
Finding a painless, cystic mass at the head of the epididymis that is clearly separate from the testicle can indicate a spermatocele. Shining a light through the mass, a process known as transillumination, can also help differentiate between a fluid-filled cyst and a tumor, which would not allow as much light to pass. If uncertainty exists, ultrasonography of the scrotum can confirm the presence of a spermatocele. The location and history of any scrotal masses are crucial in determining whether or not the mass is benign or malignant. Lab tests such as a complete blood count (CBC test) or urine test can also be conducted to check for any possible infection or signs of inflammation.

Spermatoceles come in varying sizes and shapes. Some spermatoceles are very small and can only be detected through an ultrasound. More commonly seen are spermatoceles that are a pea-sized lump. They tend to form above or behind a testicle and have a shape and size that looks like a pea. Larger growths have been reported to look similar to a third testicle and can be very discomforting. For those who are affected with large spermatoceles, some have reported feeling pain, heaviness, and fullness in the affected testicle.

=== When to see a doctor ===
If a person is experiencing pain and/or swelling in the scrotum or if a person notices a physical difference such as a mass during a testicular self-exam then they must seek medical attention quickly to help rule out any other causes and begin treatment.

== Special Populations ==

=== Spermatoceles in Children ===
Epididymal cysts may arise in children due to numerous different reasons. They may even originate from a disturbance in endocrine factors during the development of the embryo. The incidence of these cysts are possibly linked to boys who are exposed to diethylstilbestrol, an estrogen medication, while in the fetus.

Although the evidence and information for incidence of spermatoceles in children is lacking, there are general management guidelines for caregivers who may encounter spermatoceles in their children. Epididymal cysts are typically benign in nature. However, caregivers should take note of any discomfort and symptoms in children, including but not limited to, erythema, scrotal edema or swelling. Epididymal cysts appear in approximately 70% of boys who present as asymptomatic. The diagnosis of epididymal cysts in children can be discovered upon physical examination and eventually confirmed via ultrasound.

==Treatment ==
Small cysts as well as asymptomatic larger cysts are better left alone and carefully observed. However, treatment can be considered if the cysts are causing discomfort/pain, enlarging in size, or per patient request. There are a few different treatment options, ranging in levels of invasiveness.

=== Medications ===
Certain drugs such as oral analgesics or anti-inflammatory medications can be taken by mouth to decrease spermatocele-related symptoms such as pain and/or swelling. At the moment, there is no medication that can inhibit the production of a spermatocele or cure it. Common medications recommended by doctors are acetaminophen (Tylenol) that can treat pain. To treat the inflammation and pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and others. Antibiotics may also be prescribed in cases where risk of infection and discomfort is indicated.

=== Medical Procedures ===
Aspiration and sclerotherapy are treatments that remove fluid from the spermatocele and seal the spermatocele sac closed from further fluid build-up, respectively. Due to a higher risk of epididymis damage, fertility problems, and further recurrences, these procedures are not recommended and not commonly used.

=== Surgical Treatments ===
Surgical treatments must be thoroughly discussed with people prior to any final decisions. Different types of surgical procedures may be chosen based on the extent of risk.

A short procedure called a spermatocelectomy can be performed for spermatoceles that cause irritating symptoms. This standard procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting with the use of local or general anesthesia. This procedure typically consists of removing the spermatocele and a portion of the epididymis. The risk of epididymal injury is 17.12%. This incident may happen when the spermatocele is being dissected from the head of the epididymis. Spermatocelectomy can cause complications such as hematoma, wound infection, scrotal abscess as well as recurrence. After surgery, the doctor may recommend to apply ice packs for several days to help reduce swelling. Oral pain medications can also be taken for a few days to reduce discomfort. In addition, the patient returns 2–6 weeks after to inspect any progress/complications. If received a vasectomy, then two semen samples must be collected and analyzed after 6–12 weeks post-operation and several ejaculations. The centrifuged semen samples are used to look for the absence of viable sperm in the semen.

==== Risk of Complications ====
After surgical removal, it is possible that the pain will persist and recurrence can occur. Fertility may be compromised with these surgical procedures, so people may consider postponing surgery until after having children. If the pain is intolerable and the person would like to get the spermatocele removed immediately, the person should talk to his doctor about the possibility of freezing or donating sperm in case infertility occurs.

== Male Reproductive System ==

Spermatoceles are important to not be ignored as it can affect the male reproductive system. The testes are organs inside the scrotum that create sperm as well as sex hormones and testosterone. The sperm in the testes move to the epididymis which is a long, coiled tube behind the testes. The primary function is to store and mature sperm so it can fertilize the egg. However, if the epididymis becomes injured, then there is a chance that the sperm will not mature and a man will not be able to reproduce with a woman. Therefore, serious thought must be considered when undergoing spermatocelectomy.

== Prevention and Screening ==
There is no way to prevent a spermatocele from forming, but there are routines that can be established to help identify any changes in a person&#x27;s scrotum such as masses, abnormalities, or discomfort. Performing a monthly testicular self-exam can improve the person&#x27;s chances of identifying spermatoceles or any abnormalities quickly.

It is best to perform a testicular self-exam after a warm shower to help the scrotum relax. To properly exam the scrotum, look for any swelling on the skin and examine each testicle by rolling the testicle between the thumbs and the fingers. A normal testicle is oval-shaped and will usually feel smooth and firm. It is also not uncommon for the testicles to be different sizes.

Upon physical examination, if a &#x27;lump&#x27; is found during the testicular exam, further screening may be performed via ultrasound to eliminate testicular cancer.

<text>The 1964 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 4, 1964, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 9 of 10 in both the 1964 World Championship of Drivers and the 1964 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 110-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill after he started from fourth position. John Surtees finished second for the Ferrari team and Brabham driver Jo Siffert came in third.

== Summary ==
Graham Hill padded his tenuous lead in the 1964 Drivers&#x27; Championship over John Surtees and Jim Clark by bringing his BRM home first at The Glen for the second straight year. Surtees was second for Ferrari, 30.5 seconds back.

The Ferrari team brought four cars for Surtees and Lorenzo Bandini, but they were not in the usual &quot;flaming red&quot; that the race program advertised. Enzo Ferrari had surrendered his entrant&#x27;s license in a dispute at Monza, so the cars were entered by Luigi Chinetti&#x27;s North American Racing Team and were painted in North American racing blue and white. The only entrant missing from the 20 who were invited was American A. J. Foyt, who was offered a works BRM drive for the race, but decided against it.

The Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation was so pleased with the new track surface that had been laid down that they believed a 120 mph (about 193 km/h) lap (1:08.9) was possible, and they had 120 bottles of champagne ready for the first one to do it. While the three remaining Championship contenders, along with American Dan Gurney, waged a stirring battle for the pole and broke Hill&#x27;s record from the previous year, they did not come close to claiming the prize.

Colin Chapman had both an older Type 25 and the new Type 33 Lotus for Clark, but the Scot had little time to practice in the newer version by the time it was ready. He set the fastest time (1:12.65) using the old, reliable one, anyway, so he decided to use it in the race. Surtees, Gurney and Hill were all under 1:13, as well, followed by Bruce McLaren and Clark&#x27;s teammate, Mike Spence.

Cool breezes and bright sun welcomed a crowd of 65,000 on Sunday to see the next to last round of a tense Championship battle. Hill led Clark by two points, with Surtees, having won two of the three previous races, just two points behind Clark in third. Clark led off the line, but Surtees and Spence quickly went past, dropping the defending Champion to third before they reached the top of the hill. After one lap, the order was Surtees, Spence, Hill, Clark, Jack Brabham, Innes Ireland, Gurney and McLaren.

Gurney quickly recovered from his poor start by getting around Ireland and Brabham. Hill briefly overtook Spence for second spot, but then Clark seemed to take the bit between his teeth. The Scot surged past the BRM of Hill and set off after Surtees, taking the lead from the Ferrari on lap 13 as they exited the right-hander before the pits. For the next 18 laps, Clark continually drew away from Surtees. Gurney passed Spence to pursue Hill for third place, until Hill moved into second place by getting around Surtees on lap 31.

On lap 40, Clark&#x27;s Lotus began to misfire as a result of a fuel injection problem. Surtees, then Hill and Gurney, went by before he entered the pits on lap 44. The crew spent two laps adjusting the injection system, and he rejoined in next to last spot, but stopped again after only six laps. Chapman called teammate Spence in from fourth place and replaced him with Clark, in the hopes that Clark could get ahead of Hill and Surtees and reduce the number of points they could earn. Spence continued in Clark&#x27;s car, but retired it after five more laps.

Meanwhile, Hill had taken the lead back from Surtees on lap 45. When the leaders came up to lap Hill&#x27;s teammate, American Richie Ginther, on lap 61, Hill&#x27;s BRM seemed to have much less trouble getting by than the pursuing Ferrari and Brabham did. Surtees and Gurney got by Ginther after another lap, but by then, Hill was fifty yards ahead and pulling away. Two laps later, Surtees spun while lapping another backmarker, and on lap 70, Gurney retired from second place with a broken Climax engine.

Clark was now in third, gaining on Hill by a second per lap and nearly matching his qualifying time, until the second Lotus also began sputtering, this time unable to pick up its last few gallons of fuel. He retired, having completed 102 laps, and was eventually classified seventh, out of the points. At the end, Hill and Surtees had the only healthy cars, and the Englishman claimed his second win of the season, now five points ahead of Surtees and nine ahead of Clark in the Championship standings. Jo Siffert was third in the Rob Walker-entered Brabham, ahead of Americans Richie Ginther and Walt Hansgen, with Trevor Taylor in sixth, scoring his only point of the season.

<text>The 1964 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca in Mexico City on 25 October 1964. It was race 10 of 10 in both the 1964 World Championship of Drivers and the 1964 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

It was perhaps the most dramatic finale in the history of the World Championship. Championship points could only be scored by the first six finishers (9–6–4–3–2–1 points). Arriving to the race, three drivers had a chance of winning the title: Graham Hill (BRM P261) with 39 points, John Surtees (Ferrari) with 34, and Jim Clark (Lotus 33-Climax) with 30. In order to win the title, Clark had to win the race, with Surtees finishing not higher than third and Hill not higher than fourth. Surtees could only win the title by finishing first, in each case, or second, unless Hill finished as high as third.

The race began with Clark leading from pole position with Dan Gurney running second in the Brabham-Climax (Gurney had only ten points going into this race having won the French Grand Prix and scored a sixth place at the Belgian Grand Prix). Hill and Lorenzo Bandini, Surtees&#x27;s teammate, were duelling for third place, with Surtees a distant fifth, seemingly with no chance at winning the title. Then Bandini ran into the back of Hill&#x27;s BRM, causing him to spin into the Armco, damaging his exhaust and lose a few places. Thereafter Hill&#x27;s car ran with a crimped exhaust pipe, causing him to lose power. The championship was now firmly in Clark&#x27;s grasp. If the positions remained the same, he would be champion with four victories to Hill&#x27;s two, although they would be tied on points at 39. On the penultimate lap, an oil line failed and Clark&#x27;s engine seized as the Lotus crossed the line, with one lap left to go. The positions were now Gurney–Bandini–Surtees, meaning the championship would be Hill&#x27;s, so long as Surtees placed no higher. Realizing Surtees could win the title by finishing second, the Ferrari team manager frantically signalled Bandini to slow down as he passed the pits to enter the last lap and let Surtees through. Bandini dutifully did so and Surtees finished second, thus winning the World Championship of Drivers by one point over Hill (40 to 39). Meanwhile, Gurney won the &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, almost unnoticed. The Ferrari cars were entered by the American NART team and painted white with blue lengthwise &quot;Cunningham racing stripes&quot;, the national colours of the teams licensed in the United States. Since Ferrari cars entered in the and seasons by the American NART team and at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix by the British privateer Reg Parnell team kept wearing the red colour, this race was the last time Ferrari cars wore other than the traditional red colour (rosso corsa) in Formula One.

== Championship scenarios ==

<text>The 1965 South African Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at East London on 1 January 1965. While originally scheduled to be the last race of the 1964 season, it was moved up by a week and thus became race 1 of 10 in the 1965 Formula One season. This scheduling change meant that the cars which were fielded were 1964 season cars, as no one had had the time to develop their 1965 designs as of yet. The 85-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after he started from pole position. John Surtees finished second for the Ferrari team and BRM driver Graham Hill came in third. This was the World Championship debut race of the future world champion Jackie Stewart.

== Race report ==

Jim Clark celebrated Hogmanay by dominating the race, leading from pole and winning by half a minute from Graham Hill and John Surtees who were never able to threaten. He even had time to complete an extra lap after the chequered flag was waved a lap too early. Clark also made the first ever lap of the East London circuit at over 100 mph in practice. Clark&#x27;s teammate Mike Spence was in second place until he spun on oil on the sixtieth lap; he finished in fourth. Bruce McLaren and Championship débutant Jackie Stewart completed the points positions. Jack Brabham had been in competition for second place but his car broke down with ignition troubles four laps from the end.

<text>The 1965 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 30 May 1965. It was race 2 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers, albeit held almost five months after the first race of the season. The 100-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill from pole position. Lorenzo Bandini finished second for the Ferrari team, and Hill&#x27;s teammate Jackie Stewart came in third.

Jim Clark, Dan Gurney and Mike Spence of Team Lotus did not participate in the Grand Prix. The team instead chose to race in the 1965 Indy 500, held the following day, which Clark won. New Zealand driver and future World Champion Denny Hulme made his Formula One World Championship debut at this Grand Prix, finishing eighth. 

, this race marked the second and most recent time a driver has crashed into the harbour when Paul Hawkins fell in on lap 79. Alberto Ascari first crashed there during his accident at the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix.

== Background ==
After debuting with Brabham at the previous race, Honda also made use of Goodyear rather than Dunlop tires in this race.

==Race report==
Hill and Stewart, both in BRMs, led the race from the start. Both spun, Hill after the car in front of him sprayed the track with parts, and Bandini took over the lead. Brabham, using the new, 32-valve Coventry Climax FWMV Mark 7 engine, overtook Bandini until the new engine blew up on the 43rd lap. Ferrari was now in first and second, with Bandini using the flat-twelve design (Ferrari 1512) while Surtees had opted for the V8-engined Ferrari 158. Hill, however, had stayed in the race and was steadily closing in. During the chase, the lap record was beaten several times. On lap 65, Hill had gotten past both Ferraris and went on to build up a sizable lead, eventually winning by over a minute. Surtees ran out of petrol on the last lap, allowing Stewart to pip him for third place, with McLaren and Siffert rounding out the points-paying positions.

<text>The 1965 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 13 June 1965. It was race 3 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by British driver Jim Clark who led every lap of the race driving a Lotus 33. It was one of the Scot&#x27;s most dominant wins. In the rain, he pulled away and with a third of the race to go, the Lotus driver was leading his fellow Scotsman Jackie Stewart by 1 minute and 20 seconds. However, for the last six laps Clark eased off dramatically and when the chequered flag was waved his lead was down to just under 45 seconds.

== Notes ==

* Jim Clark now held the sole record of four Belgian Grand Prix wins, breaking the old record of three wins set by Juan Manuel Fangio at the 1955 Belgian Grand Prix.
* This was the first Formula One World Championship point for Honda as a constructor and as an engine supplier, also the first for a Japanese and Asian constructor and engine supplier.
* A Coventry Climax-powered car now had won the Belgian Grand Prix a record five times, breaking the old record of four wins set by Ferrari at the 1961 Belgian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1965 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Charade, Clermont-Ferrand on 27 June 1965. It was race 4 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The 40-lap race was won by Scotland&#x27;s Jim Clark. Driving the Climax-engined Lotus 25, Clark took pole position, led every lap and set the fastest lap. It was his third win in four races, and his second Grand Slam of the season. Clark&#x27;s Grand Slam followed his Grand Slam at the South African Grand Prix, making him the first driver to win a Grand Slam in subsequent races since Alberto Ascari. Fellow Scottish driver Jackie Stewart finished second in a BRM, with Englishman John Surtees third in a Ferrari.

<text>The 1965 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 10 July 1965. It was race 5 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 80-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after he started from pole position. Graham Hill finished second for the BRM team and Ferrari driver John Surtees came in third.

== Race report ==
The race itself was dramatic. Clark led away from pole with Hill close behind. With 16 laps to go, the BRM driver had begun experiencing brake issues and was 35 seconds adrift of the leading Lotus. Then the Scot started to lose oil pressure, which was getting worse every lap. Clark – thinking fast – chose to nurse his car to the finish by killing the engine through the fast corners. This meant that he lost at least 2 seconds per lap, which allowed Hill to close up rapidly. At the chequered flag, Clark was still running, but his lead had shrunk to a mere 3 seconds. As of 2024, this was the last British Grand Prix to have an all British podium.

The 80-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after he started from second position. Jackie Stewart finished second for the BRM team and Brabham driver Dan Gurney came in third.

== Race report ==

There was drama before the race when Lotus boss Colin Chapman punched a policeman, Chapman was arrested hours after the race but the Dutch police kept him in for two days.

Honda capitalised on their long hours of testing at Zandvoort when Ginther claimed a front-row space with Graham Hill and Clark. He shot into the lead for the first 2 laps. Hill took the lead and then Clark overtook him on lap 6. Hill fell back with rev counter problems and Stewart was left to duel with first Gurney and then Clark-ending up with a Scottish 1–2.

<text>The 1965 German Grand Prix (formally the XXVII Großer Preis von Deutschland) was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on August 1, 1965. It was race 7 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 15-lap race was won by Jim Clark, who in his Lotus-Climax, took pole position, the fastest lap of the race, and led every lap. The victory ensured that Clark won the World Championship of Drivers with three races left to go. It also meant that Lotus won the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers at the same time. BRM driver, Graham Hill, finished the race in second position in front of Brabham-Climax driver, Dan Gurney, who completed the podium by finishing third. Clark&#x27;s victory was his 3rd grand slam of the season and the final grand slam of his career.

==Race report==
Graham Hill could still theoretically overhaul Clark for the championship. However Clark became Champion with a masterful performance, leading from pole to the flag and setting fastest lap, to gain maximum points with 3 Grand Prix still to be run. Behind him, the rest of the pack had all sorts of mechanical problems-Surtees had gear selection problems, Stewart bent a wishbone, Hulme punctured his fuel tank when his seat worked loose and Amon had transistor problems despite borrowing two transistor boxes. Clark was duly crowned as champion at the start of August, the earliest the championship had been won until 2002, when Michael Schumacher obtained his 5th title on July 21.

<text>The 1965 Italian Grand Prix (formally the XXXVI Gran Premio d&#x27;Italia) was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 12 September 1965. It was race 8 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Jackie Stewart who took his first Grand Prix victory, whilst driving for the BRM team. His teammate - Graham Hill - finished second after a closely contested race between both the pair and pole-sitter and Jim Clark, who driving for the Lotus-Climax team, had secured the 1965 Drivers&#x27; Championship at the previous race. His fuel-pump failure with a handful of laps to go, and also the preceding retirement of Ferrari driver John Surtees, ensured that Dan Gurney of the Brabham-Climax team picked up the final position on the podium.

==Race report==
Jim Clark duelled for the lead through the first two-thirds of the race with Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart and John Surtees (who dropped out with clutch problems), until lap 64 when his fuel pump failed. Stewart took up the lead and it was expected that he would move over to give his team leader the victory. The enthusiastic crowd were waiting for the BRM cars to come over the line in formation. However, on the approach to the Parabolica on the last time, Hill moved over too far and bounced across the grass, struggling to maintain grip on the mud and gravel. Stewart therefore claimed his first win in a BRM 1–2 from Hill. Dan Gurney took the final podium place and Lorenzo Bandini, Bruce McLaren and Richard Attwood completed the placings. The race featured 42 lead changes between four drivers (all British), the most ever in a Formula One motor race.

<text>The 1965 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 3, 1965, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 9 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 110-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill after he started from pole position. Dan Gurney finished second for the Brabham team and his teammate Jack Brabham came in third.

==Summary==
In the last year of the 1.5-liter formula, Jim Clark had clinched his second Drivers&#x27; Championship (as well as winning the Indianapolis 500) before the teams arrived in North America for the season&#x27;s last two races. Once again, however, it was Graham Hill and BRM who reigned at The Glen, winning for the third year in a row. Hill took pole, win and fastest lap, finishing twelve seconds ahead of the Brabhams of Dan Gurney and Sir Jack.

The weekend was cold (), windy (30 mph), and often wet. In practice, Jim Clark—a Scot, no less—wore a sweater over his driving suit. Ferrari was missing the previous year&#x27;s World Champion, John Surtees, who had been injured in a sports car race in Canada the previous week. Hill&#x27;s new BRM teammate, Jackie Stewart, who had broken Clark&#x27;s string of five consecutive victories with his first Grand Prix win at Monza three weeks before, was running at The Glen for the first time, as was Austrian Jochen Rindt. American Bob Bondurant was making his Formula One debut.

The track was shrouded in mist on Friday, as Clark switched back and forth between his Lotus, with a 32-valve Climax engine, and teammate Mike Spence&#x27;s 16-valve model. After bending the suspension on Spence&#x27;s car by hitting the curb in &#x27;The 90&#x27;, Clark got back in his car and did a 1:12.7, which was fastest of the day until Hill beat it by two-tenths.

On Saturday, sunny but still cold, Clark and Hill continued their battle. Hill posted a 1:11.25 in the BRM, and Clark just failed to match him in his 32-valve Lotus, getting down to 1:11.35 before he sheared two teeth on a timing gear. Again, the Scot took teammate Spence&#x27;s car, and he recorded a remarkable time of 1:11.16 to complete the duel. Overnight, however, the 32-valve engine was repaired, and when Clark decided to use it in the race, he would have to start from the second spot, alongside Hill. American Richie Ginther used the spare Honda to grab third spot, as the powerful V–12 made him the fastest car down the straight. The top six on the grid were Hill, Clark, Ginther, Spence, Lorenzo Bandini&#x27;s Ferrari and Stewart.

It rained on Sunday morning, but a strong wind dried the track in time for the start, and 60,000 fans watched with hoods and parkas against the changing conditions. Hill jumped into an early lead, trailed by Clark and Ginther. Stewart charged up from the third row and moved inside Ginther in the Esses, but the Honda pinched the gap closed, forcing Stewart into the curb and bending his suspension. Stewart continued, while the stunned Ginther dropped back to eighth, but the throttle cable on Stewart&#x27;s car split and he limped around to the pits. By the time he rejoined the race, the rain had returned, making his bent suspension too big of a handicap, and he retired.

On the second lap, Clark took the lead from Hill, as the two pulled away from Bandini, Spence, Gurney and Brabham. Three laps later, Hill regained the lead, and the two British World Champions dueled until lap 12, when Hill&#x27;s BRM appeared alone, and Clark coasted into the pits with a broken piston. The group of four following the leaders had been battling hard, as Spence was twice forced off the road by Bandini, and retired on lap six with a broken timing chain. Hill now led Gurney by 14 seconds, followed by Bandini and Brabham.

By lap 24, Hill led by almost half a lap. Then, a sudden shower soaked the track as the leader began lap 37. In &#x27;The Loop&#x27; at the end of the back straight, Hill was caught out by the slippery surface and went straight on into the grass, then bounced along for 200 yards before regaining the track. Hill&#x27;s Dunlop tires were two seconds per lap slower in the wet than the Brabham team&#x27;s Goodyears, and, aided by the off-track excursion, Gurney and Jack Brabham were able to close the sizable gap. Gurney pulled right up on the BRM&#x27;s tailpipes, but in his zeal, he overdid a corner and allowed teammate Brabham by into second. Now, it was team leader Brabham&#x27;s turn to have a go, and he moved ahead of Hill on the outside of &#x27;The 90,&#x27; right before the pits. Hill had been consistently taking corners with a late apex, then power-sliding the car around the outside of the turn&#x27;s exit. Hill&#x27;s wide line out of the corner again carried him to the edge of the track, and with Brabham on his left, he forced the two-time Champion off and into a slow 360 across the wet grass. Gurney was back in second, and Brabham rejoined, once again in third. Gurney may have been tempted to challenge for the lead again, but a slipping clutch caused him to think better of it.

With the track almost completely dry near the end of the race, Hill put his foot down and set the fastest lap of the afternoon on lap 105. He came home twelve seconds ahead for his second win of the year and the completion of a remarkable three-year run at The Glen. After the season, the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation was awarded the Grand Prix Drivers Association&#x27;s &quot;Best Organized Race Award,&quot; the first of three times The Glen would receive the honor.

<text>The 1965 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca in Mexico City on October 24, 1965. It was race 10 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Richie Ginther, who took his first and only victory, first for the Honda team and, excluding the Indianapolis 500, first win for the non-European team, after leading for the entire race. The Brabham-Climax of Dan Gurney finished the race second and the Lotus-Climax of Mike Spence completed the podium.

== Race report ==

The Mexican Grand Prix provided a host of new records - the last race of the 1500cc era was the only one of the season not to be won by a British-powered car and also the only race not to be won by a British driver. Honda&#x27;s testing proved to be of benefit as Jim Clark and Graham Hill dropped out with engine problems and Jackie Stewart retired with clutch problems to leave Dan Gurney as the only challenger to Richie Ginther. Lorenzo Bandini and Pedro Rodríguez collided at the hairpin, leaving Ginther to stroll home for Honda&#x27;s first, and his only, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; win. Goodyear also bowed out of Formula One in winning form. Gurney and Mike Spence took the other podium places, with Jo Siffert, Ronnie Bucknum and Richard Attwood completing the points scorers.

== Notes ==

* This marked Richie Ginther&#x27;s first and only Grand Prix win.
* It was the first Formula One World Championship Grand Prix win and podium for Honda, for a Honda-powered car, and for a Japanese/Asian manufacturer and engine supplier.

<text>The 1966 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Monaco on 22 May 1966. It was race 1 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the first World Championship event of a new era for Formula One, for which engine regulations were altered from 1.5 litres of maximum engine displacement to 3.0 litres. The race was the 24th Monaco Grand Prix.

The race was won by British driver Jackie Stewart driving a BRM P261. He took a forty-second victory over the Ferrari 246 of Italian driver Lorenzo Bandini. It was Stewart&#x27;s second Grand Prix victory after winning the Italian Grand Prix the previous year. Stewart&#x27;s team-mate, fellow Briton Graham Hill finished a lap down in third position in his BRM P261. The only other driver to be classified as a finisher was American driver Bob Bondurant driving a BRM P261 entered privately by Team Chamaco Collect.

== Race report ==
The first World Championship race of the new 3-litre engine formula was held in Monaco. No team was ready for the new regulations, not even those who built their own engines, like Ferrari and BRM, with several teams starting the race with 1965 engines still in place, some of them enlarged Coventry Climax V8. Even pre-1961 engines of the 2.5 litre era were used again, namely the 4cyl Coventry Climax. Some had downsized sports car racing engines to suit, but these were heavy and lacked power. As a 4.2 litre DOHC Ford Indy V8 engine had helped Jim Clark and Team Lotus win the 1965 Indianapolis 500, Bruce McLaren had contracted third parties to make the smaller 3.0 L (180 cu in) Ford 406 that had been chosen by Team McLaren for the F1 constructor debut with the McLaren M2B. It lasted for only 9 laps in the race before leaking oil. 

Some sessions were filmed for the movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Thus, the British-licensed as well as based and New Zealand-owned McLaren team debuted not in British racing green nor in New Zealand&#x27;s traditional racing colours of green, black and silver, but instead in white and green in order for &quot;Grand Prix&quot; director John Frankenheimer to be able to use the McLaren as a double for the fictional Yamura cars in the film.

Another new engine based on an American Buick V8 was the Australian Repco V8 in the back of Brabham&#x27;s new 1966 BT19 chassis. John Surtees, though still recovering from a crash at Mosport Park, led for 14 laps from Jackie Stewart, Jochen Rindt and Denny Hulme until his differential broke, handing the lead to Stewart. Hulme retired whilst Graham Hill and Jim Clark disputed third place before Clark&#x27;s suspension gave out. Meanwhile, Lorenzo Bandini was smashing the lap record before having to ease off to prevent the front brakes wearing out. Stewart won from Bandini with Graham Hill third and Bob Bondurant fourth the only other car past the line in a race of extreme attrition. New rules meant that cars had to complete 90% of the race distance to be classified and eligible for points, meaning that whilst Guy Ligier and Jo Bonnier were still racing, they were considered far enough behind to have actually retired. To this day, this race holds the record for having the fewest classified finishers in a single race in Formula One history.

<text>The 1966 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 12 June 1966. It was race 2 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the 26th Belgian Grand Prix and was held over 28 laps of the 14.1-kilometre circuit for a race distance of 395 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver and 1964 world champion, John Surtees, driving a Ferrari 312 in a race that saw the field decimated by weather in the early laps. It was Surtees&#x27; fourth Grand Prix victory and his first since the 1964 Italian Grand Prix. Surtees won by 42 seconds over Austrian driver Jochen Rindt driving a Cooper T81, Rindt achieving his first podium finish and the first for the new Cooper-Maserati combination as the works Cooper Car Company team looked to the three-litre Maserati V12 sports car engine for the new regulations. Surtees&#x27; Italian team mate Lorenzo Bandini finished third in his Ferrari 246.

With a pair of podiums, Bandini took the lead in the championship by a point over the two race winners, Surtees and Jackie Stewart.

==Race summary==
The race distance was shortened from the previous year, from 32 to 28 laps. More than half the field crashed out on the first lap due to a heavy rainstorm and only seven runners remained by the start of the second lap. Four drivers went off and crashed at the sweeping Burnenville corner, where the heavy wall of rain was. Jo Bonnier crashed with his Cooper T81 coming to rest balancing on a parapet, the front half car in the air. Jackie Stewart&#x27;s BRM P261 crashed into a telephone pole and then landed in a ditch at Masta Kink, leading to him being stuck upside down in his BRM, halfway up to his waist in fuel, for 25 minutes. Graham Hill and Bob Bondurant, both of whom had gone off near Stewart, managed to rescue him with a spectator&#x27;s toolkit. Jack Brabham slid his Brabham BT19 coming out of the Masta Kink at 135 mph, but regained control of the car and rejoined the race. There was so much water on the track that it got into and flooded the Climax engine in Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus 33, putting him out on the first lap too. The entire first lap was run under green flags.

The race was filmed for the motion picture &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. The eight-minute segment of the 1966 film uses a combination of live footage and mocked-up racing scenes. The live footage shows Surtees, Bonnier, Bandini, Ligier, Clark and Gurney in action. Surtees doubles in the scene for the fictional Jean-Pierre Sarti while Bandini doubles for the fictional Nino Barlini. The film is careful not to pick up Jackie Stewart in action as he doubles for the fictional character Scott Stoddard, who at this point in the film is recovering from a near fatal crash earlier in the season, although this was fairly easy since Stewart crashed on the first lap. James Garner&#x27;s white &quot;Yamura&quot;, a repainted McLaren, did not appear in the actual race and scenes showing it are part of the staged race filming.

Because of McLaren&#x27;s withdrawal, Bob Bondurant&#x27;s car had to be painted white overnight in order to have actual footage featuring the &quot;Yamura&quot; car. In addition, Phil Hill was allowed to do one lap of the track with his car having a camera mounted on its nose. He managed to avoid the entire first-lap carnage and was able to get pictures of the scene.

After his accident in this race, Jackie Stewart began his efforts for safer racing which continued for decades; particularly after his influence as a Formula One racing driver grew through the next seven seasons he competed in the sport.

== Classification ==

=== Qualifying ===

* Bondurant drove car #8 in practice alongside Wilson, but he would drive car #24 in the race.

<doc id="1122349" wikidata="Q368741" url="?curid=1122349" title="Ritter">
<text>Ritter (German for &quot;knight&quot;) is a designation used as a title of nobility in German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second-lowest rank within the nobility, standing above &quot;Edler&quot; and below &quot;&quot; (Baron). As with most titles and designations within the nobility in German-speaking areas, the rank was hereditary and generally was used with the nobiliary particle of [[von]] or zu before a family name.

For its historical association with warfare and the landed gentry in the Middle Ages, the title of Ritter can be considered roughly equal to the titles of &quot;Knight&quot;, but it is hereditary like the British title of &quot;Baronet&quot;. The wife of a Ritter was called a &quot;Frau&quot; (in this sense &quot;Lady&quot;) and not Ritterin.

In heraldry, from the late 18th century, a Ritter was often indicated by the use of a coronet with five points, But not everyone who was a Ritter and displayed arms made use of such a coronet. In the Austrian Empire and in Austria-Hungary, the title of &quot;Ritter von&quot; was bestowed upon citizens who deserved more than the plain &quot;von&quot; but were not considered deserving enough as to be given a barony and designated as &quot;&quot;. 

Even today, members of the Central European Order of St. George, which goes back to Emperor Maximilian and was later reactivated by the Habsburgs after its dissolution by Nazi Germany, are &quot;Ritter&quot; (knights).

In addition to the described system, Württemberg introduced orders of merit beginning in the late 18th century, which also conferred nobility as &quot;Ritter von&quot; but kept the title limited to the recipient&#x27;s lifetime (see Military Order of Max Joseph).

<doc id="1122352" wikidata="Q1526759" url="?curid=1122352" title="Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)">
<text>Creedence Clearwater Revival is the debut studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released in July 1968, by Fantasy Records in the US. Featuring the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Susie Q&quot;, which reached number 11 in the US charts, it was recorded shortly after the band changed its name from the Golliwogs and began developing a signature swamp rock sound.

==Background==
While &quot;Suzie Q&quot; proved to be a hit, the band had played for years as the Golliwogs in the early 1960s, releasing numerous singles before achieving success in the pop world. In 1967, Saul Zaentz bought Fantasy Records and offered the band a chance to record a full-length album on the condition that they change their name. Having never liked &#x27;the Golliwogs&#x27;, the four readily agreed, coming up with Creedence Clearwater Revival. In Hank Bordowitz&#x27;s book &quot;Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival&quot;, bassist Stu Cook is quoted, &quot;Fogerty, Cook, Clifford and Fogerty signed a publishing agreement with one of Fantasy&#x27;s companies that gave up rights to copyright ownership...Lennon and McCartney never owned the copyrights to their compositions, either. When you&#x27;re on the bottom, you make the best deal you can.&quot; John Fogerty took charge of the group artistically, writing all of the band&#x27;s fourteen hit records and assuming the roles of singer, guitarist, producer and arranger of nearly everything that appeared on Creedence&#x27;s seven studio albums.

==Composition==
&quot;Porterville&quot;, which was the last single released by the band under the name the Golliwogs in November 1967, was included on the band&#x27;s debut album and revealed singer/guitarist John Fogerty&#x27;s nascent songwriting talents. The song was a breakthrough of sorts for Fogerty, who stated to Tom Pinnock of &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2012, &quot;It&#x27;s semi-autobiographical; I touch on my father, but it&#x27;s a flight of fantasy, too. And I knew when I was doing it, &#x27;Man, I&#x27;m on to something here.&#x27; Everything changed after that. I gave up trying to write sappy love songs about stuff I didn&#x27;t know anything about, and I started inventing stories.&quot; The album also includes the only co-write between John and his brother Tom Fogerty (who had been the original lead singer in the group) to appear on a Creedence album: &quot;Walk on the Water&quot;. The song had already been released in 1966 under the Golliwogs name -- but unlike CCR&#x27;s &quot;Porterville&quot;, which was the exact same recording as the earlier Golliwogs single, the version of &quot;Walk On The Water&quot; included on this album was a completely new recording. The album features three other John Fogerty originals: &quot;The Working Man&quot;, &quot;Get Down Woman&quot;, and &quot;Gloomy&quot;.

&quot;Creedence Clearwater Revival&quot; is best remembered for the band&#x27;s first hit single &quot;Susie Q&quot;, which had been a hit for Dale Hawkins in 1957. It was released as a single version split into two parts, with the jam session during the coda on the A-side fading out with the guitar solo right before the coda which fades in part two on the B-side. Fogerty stated in a 1993 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that his purpose in recording &quot;Susie Q&quot; was to get the song played on KMPX, a funky progressive-rock radio station in San Francisco, which is why the song was extended to eight minutes in length. Susie Q&#x27; was designed to fit right in,&quot; he explained. &quot;The eight-minute opus. Feedback. Like [the Paul Butterfield Blues Band&#x27;s] &#x27;East-West&#x27;. And especially the little effect, the little telephone-box [vocal] in the middle, which is the only part I regret now. It&#x27;s just funny sounding. But, lo and behold, it worked!&quot; Fogerty elaborated to Larry King in 1999, &quot;We recorded an old Dale Hawkins song but I psychedelicized it to get it played on the local San Francisco underground radio station.&quot; The guitarist on the original Hawkins version, James Burton, would also exert a major influence on Fogerty, with the singer telling Lynne Margolis of &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, &quot;James Burton was a huge influence on me going back to when I was a child, when I bought that record, &#x27;Susie Q,&#x27; and that was James Burton playing that guitar—which I didn&#x27;t know at the time, of course.&quot; Drummer Doug Clifford concurs to Jeb Wright on the &quot;Classic Rock Revisited&quot; website that he too tried to experiment with the tune, recalling Susie Q&#x27; was a rockabilly song that sounded like all of the other rockabilly songs. I came up with a quarter note idea and it made it harder edged and it gave it space and a totally different feel...&quot; The Creedence version would reach #11 in the charts. In 2012 David Cavanagh of &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote, &quot;For all his skepticism about long solos, Fogerty stretched out penetratingly on guitar while Creedence&#x27;s rhythm trio laid down a sublime slow boogie.&quot; In 1998, Fogerty stated to Harold Steinblatt of &quot;Guitar World&quot; that the recording of &quot;Susie Q&quot; was &quot;very pivotal&quot; in another respect:

It established how we would work for the next few years. After we finished recording our parts, the other guys hung around while I mixed. The problem was they were making all these comments like, &quot;Well, that won&#x27;t work. This won&#x27;t work.&quot; You know, they were having a great time laughing...And that was the very last time I ever allowed them to be around when I mixed a record...Basically, we&#x27;d go in, we&#x27;d record the band, and then I&#x27;d throw them out of the studio. I just couldn&#x27;t have them around while I was doing overdubs or when I was mixing, because they weren&#x27;t very constructive.

The other single from the album was also a cover: &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins. Released as a follow-up to &quot;Susie Q&quot; in October 1968 with &quot;Walk on the Water&quot; as the B-side, it peaked on the U.S. charts at #58.

The album was remastered and reissued on 180 Gram vinyl by Analogue Productions in 2006.

==Reception==

While the band did gain success with their chart debut, critics initially denied the band respect. Barry Gifford writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at the time stated, &quot;The only bright spot in the group is John Fogerty, who plays lead guitar and does the vocals. He&#x27;s a better-than-average singer (really believable in Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;Ninety-Nine and a Half&quot;), and an interesting guitarist. But there&#x27;s nothing else here. The drummer is monotonous, the bass lines are all repetitious and the rhythm guitar is barely audible.&quot; Time has been far kinder to the album, although critics note that Fogerty&#x27;s songwriting talent had yet to truly blossom as it would on the band&#x27;s future albums and singles.

On AllMusic the album received 4 stars (out of 5), with Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating: &quot;Released in the summer of 1968 - a year after the Summer of Love, but still in the thick of the Age of Aquarius - Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s self-titled debut album was gloriously out-of-step with the times, teeming with John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Americana&quot; fascinations.&quot; He also noted that the album &quot;points the way to the breakthrough of &quot;Bayou Country&quot;, with &quot;Porterville&quot; being &quot;an exceptional song with great hooks, an underlying sense of menace, and the first inkling of the working-class rage that fueled such landmarks as &#x27;Fortunate Son.&#x27;&quot;

The album was first certified Gold by the RIAA on December 16, 1970, then Platinum twenty years later on December 13, 1990.

<doc id="1122353" wikidata="Q221405" url="?curid=1122353" title="1966 French Grand Prix">
<text>The 1966 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Reims on 3 July 1966. It was race 3 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the &quot;60th Anniversary race&quot; of Grand Prix racing, which had started with the GP of France in 1906. It was also the 16th and last time the French Grand Prix was held on variations of French highways near Reims, following a three-year absence from the region. The race was held over 48 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by the 1959 and 1960 World Champion, Australian driver Jack Brabham, driving his Brabham BT19. It was Brabham&#x27;s eighth Grand Prix victory and his first since the 1960 Portuguese Grand Prix, six years earlier. It was also his first win since establishing his Brabham team, and the first win for the Australian-developed Repco V8 engine. Brabham became the first driver to win a World Championship Grand Prix in a car bearing his own name. British driver Mike Parkes finished second in a Ferrari 312, 9.5 seconds behind, while Brabham&#x27;s team-mate, New Zealander Denny Hulme, finished third in his Brabham BT20, albeit two laps down.

Brabham now led the Driver&#x27;s Championship on 12 points, two ahead of Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini and three ahead of BRM&#x27;s Jackie Stewart and Ferrari&#x27;s John Surtees. The win was the first of four in succession for Brabham as he began his march towards his third world title.

==Race summary==
Jim Clark was a non-starter, recovering from an accident after he was hit in the eye by a bird during practice. Qualifying was firmly in the hands of Ferrari and especially Lorenzo Bandini with a pole set at 2:07.8 in his 3-litre 312/66, averaging 146.112 mph (233.780 km/h). After the start, Bandini duly led, with Jack Brabham in what would later be nicknamed his &#x27;Old Nail&#x27; BT19 – which had a bit less straightline speed – following in his slipstream for a while. Mike Parkes, who had taken over at Ferrari from John Surtees acquitted himself well, duelling with Graham Hill for third place, becoming second when Hill&#x27;s camshaft broke. When the Italian had to retire due to a broken throttle linkage, Brabham took first place at the finish – his first win since the 1960 Portuguese Grand Prix and the first driver to win a championship Grand Prix in his own car. It was also the last race ever at Reims-Gueux, the original venue of the Formula One French Grand Prix.

1950 World Champion Nino Farina died in a car accident while on his way to watch this race.

<text>The 1966 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Brands Hatch on 16 July 1966. It was race 4 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 21st British Grand Prix and the second to be held at Brands Hatch. It was held over 80 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a race distance of 341 kilometres.

The race, the first of the new three-litre engine regulation era where starters reached 20 cars, was won for the third time by Australian driver Jack Brabham in his Brabham BT19, his second win in succession after winning the French Grand Prix two weeks earlier. New Zealand driver Denny Hulme finished second in his Brabham BT20, a first 1–2 win for the Brabham team. The pair finished a lap ahead of third placed British driver Graham Hill in his BRM P261. Ferrari did not participate in this Grand Prix weekend to honour a metalworkers strike in Italy.

Brabham&#x27;s win ended a streak of 4 consecutive wins by Jim Clark at the British Grand Prix.

Brabham&#x27;s win put him ten points clear in the championship chase over Austrian Cooper racer Jochen Rindt with Hulme and Ferrari&#x27;s Lorenzo Bandini a point further back.

==Race summary==
Brabham and Hill duelled at the start, until rain storms arrived on the circuit. Whilst Brabham maintained his lead, Rindt who had changed to rain tyres was catching him rapidly, whilst John Surtees in the Cooper was in third, well clear of the rest of the field. Hill and Jim Clark then battled for second and third until Clark pitted and then Hulme took over second place. As the rain dried, Rindt fell back. Surtees retired with mechanical problems, leaving Clark in fourth. Brabham duly led home teammate Hulme, Hill, Clark, Rindt and Bruce McLaren.

<text>The 1966 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on July 24, 1966. It was race 5 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the 16th Dutch Grand Prix since it was first held in 1948. It was held over 90 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a race distance of 382 kilometres.

The race was the third in succession to be won by Australian driver, 1959 and 1960 world champion, Jack Brabham in his Brabham BT19. Brabham lapped the field on his way to his second Dutch Grand Prix victory to add to his win in 1960. British driver, 1962 world champion Graham Hill finished second in his BRM P261, himself a lap ahead of the rest of the field. Reigning world champion Jim Clark took his first podium finish of the year in his Lotus 33, after duelling with the Brabhams in the early stages, even leading the race and pulling away before suffering a water pump failure that set him back two laps.

Brabham&#x27;s win expanded his points lead to 16 points over Hill, with Hill&#x27;s BRM teammate Jackie Stewart two points further away.

<text>The 1966 German Grand Prix was a mixed Formula One and Formula Two motor race held at the Nürburgring Nordschleife on 7 August 1966. It was race 6 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the 28th German Grand Prix and the 22nd to be held at the Nordschleife. It was held over 15 laps of the 22 kilometre circuit for a race distance 342 kilometres.

The race was won by 1959 and 1960 World Champion Jack Brabham driving his Brabham BT19, his fourth win in succession. Brabham won by 43 seconds over the Cooper T81 driven by 1964 World Champion John Surtees. Surtees&#x27; Austrian teammate Jochen Rindt finished third. The first Formula Two driver to finish was French driver Jean-Pierre Beltoise in eighth driving a Matra Sports entered Matra MS5.

The race also saw the death of British driver John Taylor after a collision with Jacky Ickx.

Brabham had collected 39 points, more than double his nearest rival, BRM driver Graham Hill.

== Race report ==
Another wet track provided a duel between Jack Brabham and John Surtees for the whole race. It was not until the Cooper&#x27;s clutch failed two laps from the end that the Australian&#x27;s win was guaranteed. Jim Clark, despite qualifying on pole, made a mistake and spun into a ditch after using the wrong tyres. In a far more serious crash, the Tyrrell-entered Matra MS5 of Jacky Ickx and the privately-entered Brabham BT11 of John Taylor crashed near the bridge between Quiddelbacher and Flugplatz. Taylor was badly burned in the accident and succumbed to his injuries four weeks later.

This would be the last Formula One race on the original Nürburgring Nordschleife before the Hohenrain chicane was added to slow the cars coming into the pits.

<text>The 1966 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 4 September 1966. It was race 7 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the 36th Italian Grand Prix and the 32nd to be held at Monza. The race was held over 68 laps of the five kilometre circuit for a race distance of 391 kilometres.

The race was won by Italian driver Ludovico Scarfiotti driving a Ferrari 312 in his only Grand Prix victory. Scarfiotti led home his British team mate Mike Parkes by five seconds. Parkes only just defeated New Zealand racer Denny Hulme in his Brabham BT20, the pair separated by less than half a second.

While series points leader Jack Brabham stopped with an oil leak in his Brabham BT19 on lap seven, he secured his third world championship, and the unique achievement of becoming world champion in a car of his own make, when his only remaining points rival John Surtees stopped with a fuel leak in his Cooper T81 24 laps later.

== Race report ==
Jack Brabham was odds-on favourite for the Championship – only John Surtees could stop him and only then by winning all three remaining races. He was prevented from doing so by an impressive performance from his former employers Ferrari at their home track. Honda had brought a new 370 bhp 3 litre V12 engine for Richie Ginther, whilst Dan Gurney had his Weslake engine and Graham Hill had the BRM H16. Lorenzo Bandini and Mike Parkes led from the start, whilst Hill&#x27;s engine gave up on the first lap, followed in retirement by Jackie Stewart on lap 5 with a fuel leak, and then Brabham on lap 8 with an engine failure which coated the car in oil. Jim Clark in the H16 Lotus was moving strongly through the field. On lap 17, Richie Ginther had a horrific accident, crashing heavily into the trees and being very fortunate to escape with his life. Once Clark had pitted, Ludovico Scarfiotti, Parkes, Surtees and Hill disputed the lead until Surtees withdrew with a split petrol tank which was pouring it all over his tyres and ending his championship chances. Denny Hulme had fought through the field to third place. But the race was Scarfiotti&#x27;s, as he became the first Italian to win for Ferrari at Monza since Alberto Ascari in 1952. Parkes completed Ferrari&#x27;s joy as he pipped Hulme by 0.3 seconds to claim second spot. Amidst all the celebrations, Jack Brabham was crowned champion. Apart from three NART entries in this race was the last time a Ferrari car was entered by a privateer team when Giancarlo Baghetti drove a private car entered by the British Reg Parnell team.

== Classification ==

=== Qualifying ===

*Clark, Geki, and Spence switched numbers for the race when they are driving the same cars.
*Phil Hill&#x27;s car was driven by Gurney in practice, but he would drive car #30 of Eagle-Weslake for the race.

=== Race ===
== Notes ==

* Ludovico Scarfiotti was only the third Italian to win his home Grand Prix, after Nino Farina and Alberto Ascari. 
* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for British engine supplier Weslake.

<text>The 1966 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 2, 1966, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 8 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the ninth United States Grand Prix (16th including the American Grand Prize races of 1908–16). It was the sixth to be held at Watkins Glen. The race was held over 108 laps of the 3.78-kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 408 kilometres.

The race was won by British driver Jim Clark driving a Lotus 43 for Team Lotus. Clark lapped the field to claim his 20th World Championship win by over a lap. The podium places were filled by Cooper Car Company team mates; Austrian driver Jochen Rindt and British driver John Surtees in their Cooper T81s.

While none of the Brabhams finished, the engine failure of Lorenzo Bandini&#x27;s Ferrari 312 saw that the Anglo-Australian team could not be caught in the race for the Constructors&#x27; championship with only the Mexican Grand Prix. This gave Jack Brabham a unique double, World Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; championships in a car of his own make. This is the only win ever for a 16 cylinder engine in a Formula One World Championship race.

==Summary==
With most of the teams struggling to come to grips with the new 3-liter formula in 1966, Jack Brabham won the World Championship with a neat, simple and lightweight chassis, the Brabham BT19. It was the Australian&#x27;s third Drivers&#x27; title, and the first by a driver in a car of his own manufacture. But it was Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus, with the powerful, normally unreliable, BRM H16 engine, that crossed the line first at Watkins Glen. Inheriting the lead when Lorenzo Bandini and Brabham retired, Clark finished a full lap ahead of Austrian Jochen Rindt, and recorded the ill-fated H16&#x27;s only win.

This was the year the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation departed from the traditional starting money system, and instead offered prize money ranging from $20,000 for first to $2,800 for twentieth. The total purse of $102,400 was easily the richest in the World Championship, and the first prize amount was more than the first prizes of all the other races put together. &quot;$100,000 was a magic number at the time,&quot; said race director Cameron Argetsinger. &quot;It was a number that spelled &#x27;big league&#x27; to American sport fans.&quot; The enthusiastic acceptance of this arrangement by the European team managers and owners marked a huge philosophical change for the Grand Prix establishment in how to promote a race meeting.

With the prize money system, finishing was doubly important and Clark intended to use the more reliable two-liter Climax engine until he discovered how quick the H16 could be. Bandini&#x27;s Ferrari was the first to break the 120-mph barrier at The Glen, as he posted a time of 1:08.67. John Surtees, now in a Cooper after leaving the Ferrari team in mid-season, and Graham Hill were the only other drivers under 1:09 on Friday.

In the closing minutes of Saturday&#x27;s session, Brabham grabbed the pole at 1:08.42, and Clark joined him on the front row with a 1:08.53. Immediately after recording his best time, Clark heard a thud behind his back, and when he stopped in the pits, there was oil dripping from the H16&#x27;s exhaust. The BRM team offered a much-used spare H16 engine, and the Lotus mechanics worked into the night fitting it into Clark&#x27;s race car.

Sunday was cool, but dry, and a crowd of 75,000 included actors James Garner (Pete Aron), Toshirō Mifune (Mr. Yomura) and Jessica Walter (Pat Stoddard), as well as director John Frankenheimer, who were in the final stages of creating the movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. An hour before the start, Clark was still unsure which car to use in the race. He finally chose the Type 43 with BRM&#x27;s spare H16, and it, too, was leaking oil on the dummy grid before the crew tightened it up and he began his warmup lap. At the flag, Bandini jumped from the second row into the lead, ahead of Clark, Richie Ginther, Brabham, Surtees, Jackie Stewart, Hill and Denny Hulme.

Ginther immediately began dropping back, while Brabham found his rhythm and moved up, taking Clark in &#x27;The 90&#x27; on lap four, and then Bandini for the lead on lap 10. Surtees also got around Clark for third spot and had attached himself to the leading pair when they came upon Peter Arundell&#x27;s Lotus on lap 16. Brabham and Bandini got by entering &#x27;The 90,&#x27; but Surtees remained stuck behind. He tried to get around Arundell on the pit straight, and again in The Esses, but as he pulled alongside, the cars touched and both slid across the grass, then headed for the pits. Surtees actually pulled in to the Lotus pit to confront Arundell and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics. Having wasted several minutes there, he rejoined in thirteenth position, two and a half laps behind.

On lap 20, Bandini regained the lead from Brabham and began to draw away until, suddenly, on lap 34, his engine blew and Brabham found himself alone with a sizable lead over Clark. Surtees, meanwhile, was still steamed over his bout with Arundell and was the fastest car on the track. He unlapped himself once and set the fastest lap of the race on lap 31. Just past half distance, on lap 55, Brabham also blew his engine. Clark was surprised to find himself in the lead, almost a minute ahead of Rindt&#x27;s Cooper. Surtees continued his charge, unlapping himself for the second time and passing Bruce McLaren and Jo Siffert for third place.

Clark was unchallenged the rest of the way, and came home with the only victory the BRM H16 engine would ever record. When Rindt coasted in two minutes, 28.5 seconds later and out of fuel, his last lap was not counted since it was more than twice the leader&#x27;s lap time. He retained second place, anyway, on the same lap as teammate Surtees, who was third. The win– Clark&#x27;s first of the year– ended Graham Hill&#x27;s three-year string at The Glen, but it marked the fourth year in a row that a BRM engine had won the American Grand Prix. While they did not score any points, Brabham-Repco won the International Cup for Formula One Constructors with one race remaining.

<text>The 1966 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca on 23 October 1966. It was race 9 of 9 in both the 1966 World Championship of Drivers and the 1966 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the fifth Mexican Grand Prix and the first to be run under the new three-litre Formula. It was held over 65 laps of the circuit for a race distance of .

The race was won by British driver John Surtees driving a Cooper T81-Maserati, his first victory since leaving Scuderia Ferrari to join Cooper. Surtees led home reigning world champion Australian owner-driver Jack Brabham, driving a Brabham BT20-Repco, by eight seconds. A lap down in third place, also driving a Brabham BT20, was Brabham&#x27;s teammate New Zealander Denny Hulme.

Surtees&#x27;s victory promoted him to second place in the championship, vaulting past Austrian driver Jochen Rindt of the Cooper works team.

== Race report ==

John Surtees dominated to take his first win since transferring from Ferrari to Cooper in mid season. He took the lead from Jack Brabham on lap 6 and was never challenged. With Jim Clark suffering gearbox problems and both BRMs retiring, Richie Ginther was the only contender left. However he too had mechanical problems, and dropped back. Brabham rallied at the end to close, but Surtees had lapped the entire field up to second. The first year of 3-litre engines had resulted in wins for five different makes of car, using five different engines.

<text>The 1967 South African Grand Prix, formally the 1st AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Eerste AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 2 January 1967. It was race 1 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 80-lap race was won by Cooper driver Pedro Rodríguez after he started from fourth position. John Love finished second in a privately entered Cooper and Honda driver John Surtees came in third.

==Race report==
This was the first use of the Kyalami circuit near Johannesburg in a World Championship Formula One race. There were some changes in the driver line-ups: John Surtees was driving for Honda, Graham Hill had switched to Lotus, his place at BRM was taken by Mike Spence and Pedro Rodríguez was on trial for Cooper.

Denny Hulme led Jack Brabham away from the start, but the Australian soon spun, handing second place to Surtees, but by lap 21 had managed to regain second. Further down the field, Rhodesian privateer racer John Love reached third place in a four-cylinder Cooper Climax. On lap 41, Brabham retired, followed by Dan Gurney on lap 44. On lap 59, Hulme had to pit for more brake fluid, handing the lead to Love. Love&#x27;s drive was halted as with just seven laps left he had to pit to take on more fuel, however it was later discovered that he&#x27;d had enough fuel to finish and instead had a misfire caused by electrical issues. Rodríguez took his first win in Formula One for Cooper from Love in second place and Surtees in third.

<text>The 1967 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on May 7, 1967. It was race 2 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers, albeit four months after Pedro Rodríguez&#x27;s unexpected victory at Kyalami. The 100-lap race was won by Brabham driver Denny Hulme after he started from fourth position. Graham Hill finished second for the Lotus team and Ferrari driver Chris Amon came in third.

The race was overshadowed by the fatal accident suffered by Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini in the late stages of the race.

Between these races, the usual pre-season races had produced some unusual results, with Dan Gurney winning at Brands Hatch, in the Race of Champions in his Eagle-Weslake, and Mike Parkes taking the BRDC International Trophy for Ferrari.

The straight after the Gasworks hairpin was lengthened by moving the &#x27;Start and Finish&#x27; closer to Ste-Devote.

==Report==

===Entry===

A total of 17 Formula One cars were entered for the event. The field was bolstered by a pair of Formula Two Matras. The Monaco circuit with its tight layout, gave the 3-litre cars no advantage, thus many top teams entered their drivers in 2 or 2.5-litre cars. In fact the Formula Two Matras were powered by 1.6-litre Cosworth engines. Honda was back with John Surtees, with a V12 engine and the Anglo American Racers were at Monaco for the first time, with their Eagle-Weslake.

===Qualifying===

Jack Brabham took pole position for Brabham Racing Organisation, in their Brabham-Repco BT19, averaging a speed of 80.779 mph, around the 1.954 miles (3.145 km) course. Brabham was joined on the front row by Ferrari&#x27;s Lorenzo Bandini. The next row featured Surtees in the Honda and Denny Hulme in the second Brabham. The third row was an all Scottish affair, with Jim Clark (Lotus-Climax) ahead of Jackie Stewart&#x27;s BRM.

===Race start through lap 81===

The opening few laps were eventful – Bandini going into the lead. Brabham&#x27;s Repco engine blew up almost immediately, at Spélugues cruve, and he spun in front of Bruce McLaren and Jo Siffert who collided taking avoiding action. Only Siffert damaged his car and had to pit for repairs. Brabham continued, but was losing oil from Mirabeau to the port, whilst Clark had to take to the escape road after slipping on Brabham&#x27;s oil. (Brabham retired at Mirabeau with a blown engine as a result.)

On lap two Clark went off and dropped to the rear of the field, while Hulme and Stewart managed to pass Bandini into the lead after he too slipped on Brabham&#x27;s oil. Hulme stayed in front until the sixth lap when Stewart swept past, until his crownwheel and pinion broke on lap 14. Hulme re-took the lead. The race settled down with Bandini second, McLaren third, after the departure of Surtees, with an engine failure. Clark&#x27;s heroic battle from 14th up to fourth ended with broken shock absorber on lap 43. This promoted Chris Amon to fourth.

In the second half of the race, Bandini began to close in on Hulme. McLaren was holding Amon at bay until he was forced into the pits to change a battery. This dropped him behind Amon and Graham Hill. Piers Courage in the BRM had spun out on the hill just out of Sainte Devote by lap 65 and retired immediately after pulling off the track.

===Lap 82 accident and finish===

On lap 82 disaster struck. Bandini&#x27;s chase ended in horror when he clipped the chicane and hit a hidden mooring head, with the car turning over and exploding into flames amongst the straw bales. Bandini was trapped in his car while it burned. The rescue operation was hopelessly inadequate, the intervention was very slow and precious minutes passed before the fire was extinguished and Bandini was rescued and rushed to hospital. The rescue was not helped by a helicopter carrying a television camera crew, as it hovered at low level, the downdraught from the rotor blades fanned what remained of the fire, which reignited with a new ferocity.

Meanwhile, Hulme continued to lead the race to the finish unchallenged. With just eight laps to go, Amon suffered a puncture and dropped to third, with second going to Hill. Three of the top four finishers (Hulme, Amon and McLaren) were New Zealand drivers - 30% of the total number of New Zealand drivers (10) who have started a Formula 1 World Championship Grand Prix.

===Post-race===
Bandini suffered horrendous burns and died of these injuries three days later - the tragedy overshadowing Hulme&#x27;s first victory on one of the world&#x27;s most difficult circuits. When the news broke, many of the star drivers were travelling to the United States to qualify for the Indianapolis 500. This was the last Monaco Grand Prix that was to run for 100 laps.

Following the sad events of this race, straw bales were banned from Grand Prix circuits. The development of fire-retardant fuel systems and flameproof clothing for drivers and marshals was accelerated, and never again would a TV camera crew be allowed to fly a helicopter low over a burning car.

<text>The 1967 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on June 4, 1967. It was race 3 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.
The race saw the debut of the Lotus 49, equipped with the Ford Cosworth DFV engine. Having tested it for a long time, Graham Hill took pole for the race. By contrast, this was the first time that the other Lotus driver, Jim Clark, ever drove the car, which — combined with mechanical issues — led to him only qualifying in eighth. Hill retired from the lead while Clark started to get a feel for the car as he fought his way through the field to record the car&#x27;s first victory in its first race. The meeting also saw the first appearance of the Brabham BT24 and the BRM P115, but neither took part in the race.

This was the last Grand Prix for the Lotus 25. Chassis R4 being driven by Chris Irwin, was the same chassis used by Jim Clark to win the 1963 World Title.

<text>The 1967 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 18 June 1967. It was race 4 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 28-lap race was won by Eagle driver Dan Gurney after he started from second position. Jackie Stewart finished second for the BRM team and Ferrari driver Chris Amon came in third. 

Excluding the Indianapolis 500, this is the only win for a USA-built car as well as one of only two wins of an American-licensed constructor in Formula One. It was also the first win for an American constructor in a Grand Prix race since the Jimmy Murphy&#x27;s triumph with Duesenberg at the 1921 French Grand Prix.

== Race report ==

Jim Clark led off the grid from pole position and maintained that position for the first 11 laps and was 20 seconds ahead of Jackie Stewart and Dan Gurney when he had to come into the pits for a plug change, which cost him two minutes. Stewart built up a comfortable lead, helped even further when Gurney had to come into the pits with fuel pressure problems, losing another 20 seconds. However, it was now Stewart&#x27;s time for mechanical problems as his gearshift was faltering. Gurney set a new lap record to catch and pass him 8 laps from the end and gain a maiden victory for the beautiful magnesium and titanium Eagle car. The light weight and advanced aerodynamics of the car made it very fast, and Gurney shattered Tony Brooks&#x27; record Grand Prix average of 143 mph (set some 8 years earlier) on his way to victory. The Eagle was timed at 196 mph on the back straight, an extraordinary speed for a car with an engine producing (at that time) something less than 400 h.p.

Mike Parkes had a horrendous crash on the first lap at the exit of Blanchimont after losing control (on oil spilled from Stewart&#x27;s BRM); his Ferrari rolled a number of times and he was thrown out of the car. Doctors considered amputating his legs and he was in a coma for a week. He survived, but had broken both of his legs. Parkes never raced in Formula One again.

== Notes ==

* This was Dan Gurney&#x27;s fourth Formula One World Championship Grand Prix win and the third with a different team. Gurney became only the second driver to win a Grand Prix driving for his own team - after Jack Brabham. This was also the first win for his team Eagle, for an American constructor and for a Weslake-powered car. Gurney&#x27;s win with Eagle was the third &quot;first&quot; win he achieved for the teams he drove for. At the 1962 French Grand Prix, Gurney had won Porsche&#x27;s first and only Grand Prix win. At the 1964 French Grand Prix, he won Brabham&#x27;s first Grand Prix win, only to win for the first time for Eagle now.

<text>The 1967 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Bugatti Circuit, Le Mans on 2 July 1967. It was race 5 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was the first French Grand Prix to be held in Le Mans since the race in 1929, and is the only time the Bugatti Circuit has been used for the Grand Prix, though the circuit continues to host the French motorcycle Grand Prix.

The new Bugatti circuit used the main pit straight at Le Mans, which back in 1967 did not have the Dunlop Chicane, but then turned right at &quot;La Chapelle&quot; into an infield section comprising the third gear &quot;Le Musée&quot; left hander and the second gear &quot;Garage Vert&quot; corner which led onto the back straight, whose only distinctive feature was the &quot;Chemin Aux Boeufs&quot; left hand kink (now a left-right chicane) some two-thirds along, before heading back to the pit straight via the &quot;S Bleu&quot; and &quot;Raccordement&quot; corners near the entrance to the pits.

The Bugatti circuit was seen as somewhat boring and was universally unpopular with both drivers and crowds, with only a reported 20,000 attending the race. Some of the drivers were reported to have privately wished the race was run on the full long Circuit de la Sarthe, where the Mulsanne Straight was longer than the entire Bugatti circuit. At the time, circuit lengths of or longer were common in Grand Prix racing, including the Spa-Francorchamps used for the Belgian Grand Prix and the Nürburgring used for the German Grand Prix, so many drivers felt that using the full 24 Hours circuit should have been considered as the venue by the Automobile Club de France.

== Race report ==
Graham Hill was on pole and led away for the first lap until Jack Brabham took over. On lap 7 Jim Clark took the lead and Hill passed Brabham to make it a Lotus 1–2. Hill then retook the lead until his crown-wheel and pinion failed on lap 14. The same problem caused Clark&#x27;s retirement from the lead on lap 23, leaving Brabham ahead of Dan Gurney, Chris Amon and Denny Hulme. On lap 41 a fuel line broke on Gurney&#x27;s car, making it a Brabham 1-2 and Amon&#x27;s throttle cable broke several laps later. Brabham drove home serenely to win his first race in eight Grands Prix by 49.5 seconds from teammate Hulme, and over a lap in front of the BRM of Jackie Stewart.

<text>The 1967 German Grand Prix was a motor race for both Formula One (F1) and Formula Two (F2) cars held at the Nürburgring on 6 August 1967. It was race 7 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers as well a non-Championship race of the 1967 European Formula Two Championship. The 15-lap race was won by Brabham driver Denny Hulme after he started from second position. His teammate Jack Brabham finished second and Ferrari driver Chris Amon came in third.

There had been some changes to the track in an attempt to slow the cars down as they approached the pit area. However, it was clear that the cars had developed considerably over 12 months, so the changes had very little effect on the lap times.

==Report==

===Entry===

A total of 16 F1 cars were entered for the event. As with the 1966 event, there were a field of 10 F2 cars. Amongst these F2 cars number of stars of tomorrow including Jacky Ickx and Jo Schlesser in their Matras. Among the field were two wooden-chassis Protos. Apart from the F2 entries, the field was much as usual except for a second Lola-BMW for Hubert Hahne. As this had a 2-litre engine, it was entered as a F1 car.

===Qualifying===
Jim Clark took pole position for Team Lotus, in their Cosworth DFV powered Lotus 49, averaging a speed of 105.598 mph around the 14.189 mile circuit. Clark was nearly 10 seconds faster than the next driver, Denny Hulme in the Brabham-Repco BT24. Third fastest was set by Ickx in his F2 Matra- 20 seconds faster than the next F2 car. As this was a Formula Two car, Ickx would have to start behind the main grid. Therefore, alongside Clark and Hulme on the four car front row was the BRM P115 of Jackie Stewart and Dan Gurney’s Eagle-Weslake T1G. The second Eagle of McLaren headed up the second row, where he was joined by John Surtees in his Honda RA273 and Jack Brabham in his Brabham-Repco BT24.

===Race===
Clark converted his pole position into an early lead, while his Team Lotus team-mate Graham Hill was pushed from his grid position of 13th, onto some grass, restarting the back of the field, behind the F2 cars. Clark stayed ahead Hulme and Gurney for the first three laps of the race. On the fourth lap, Clark dramatically slowed, his suspension having buckled, and so ended his race. Hill managed his Lotus up to tenth before mechanical troubles eventually put him out of the race.

Immediately, Gurney passed Hulme for the lead, while Brabham was third after McLaren retired with a split oil pipe. Ickx continued to impress. He was now up to fifth, behind Stewart. The Scotsman overtook Brabham, only to encounter transmission problems, and so Ickx moved up to fourth. Shortly after this, the Ferrari of Chris Amon closed up and passed the F2 Matra. By lap 12, Ickx was also out of the race, following the collapse of this front suspension. On the next lap, the universal joint on a driveshaft broke for the race leader, Gurney. Hulme took the lead to win from his team-mate Brabham and fellow Kiwi, Amon. This was the first Championship race since 1962 French Grand Prix without a driver from the United Kingdom on the podium.

<text>The 1967 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada on August 27, 1967. The 90-lap contest was race 8 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was won by Jack Brabham driving for his own Brabham team. This was the first Canadian Grand Prix to have World Championship status.

Having already changed his battery on the grid, losing six laps, local driver Al Pease spun his private Eagle-Climax and stalled out on the circuit during the race, and suffered another flat battery. He ran back to the pits for a new one, ran back to the car, fitted the battery himself and continued. He was still running at the finish, albeit 43 laps down on Brabham.

<text>The 1967 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza on 10 September 1967. It was race 9 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by British driver John Surtees driving a Honda. It was the sixth and final career victory for Surtees, as well as the first ever race for the Honda RA300 which he drove to victory. This was the first Formula One race where start lights were used.

This race is considered one of Jim Clark&#x27;s greatest performances in Formula One. He led the race until lap 12 when he picked up a puncture and lost an entire lap. He then spent the next 48 laps recovering through the field, taking the lead on lap 60, and pulled away. But on the final lap, a lack of fuel in Clark&#x27;s Lotus 49 allowed Jack Brabham and Surtees to pass the Scotsman and finish first and second, with Surtees ahead by less than a car length at the line. This was the second victory for the Honda F1 team, and the last for the factory team until Jenson Button won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1967 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 1, 1967, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 10 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 108-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after he started from second position. His teammate Graham Hill finished second and Brabham driver Denny Hulme came in third.

==Summary==

Jim Clark nursed his limping car through the final two laps and came home six seconds ahead of Lotus teammate Graham Hill to win his third and final American Grand Prix. It was the Scot&#x27;s third win of the season, and the twenty-third of his career. The following April, Clark was killed in a Formula Two race in Germany, but two more wins (in Mexico and South Africa) gave him the most wins in Grand Prix history with 25, one more than Argentina&#x27;s Juan Manuel Fangio.
&quot;Since they had appeared at the third race of the year in the Netherlands, Colin Chapman&#x27;s Lotus 49s had been the fastest cars on the track, taking the pole in all seven races they entered. The reliability of the Lotus cars had been another issue entirely, however, and, when the series returned to North America for the final two races, the only remaining contenders for the Driver&#x27;s Championship were Brabham teammates Sir Jack (the defending Champion) and Denny Hulme.&quot;
Friday practice began under a dark, misty cloud and, as the weather slowly improved, the Lotus cars again posted the fastest times with Clark ahead of Hill. Saturday was much clearer, and nearly everyone improved their time from the previous day. Late in the session, Clark posted a 1:06.07, breaking the 125 mph average speed barrier, and seemingly securing the pole. Hill, however, was still set on winning the $1,000 prize for the pole, and, with Clark testing his car&#x27;s handling on full tanks, he snatched the prize from his teammate with a time of 1:05.48. Dan Gurney, who had become the first American to win a Grand Prix in a car of his own design at Belgium, was third in the Eagle-Weslake, and Chris Amon was fourth in the only Ferrari present.
&quot;A crowd of 80,000 was greeted with beautiful bright sun on race day. The previous evening, Walter Hayes, public affairs director of Ford of Dagenham, who had contributed £75,000 toward the development of the Cosworth-Ford V8, demonstrated his confidence in a good showing by the two Lotus-Ford drivers when he proposed that they should flip a coin to choose the winner, in case both cars were in contention at the end of the race! The drivers agreed when they decided that the arrangement could be reversed in Mexico, and Hill won the toss.&quot;
At the start, the Lotus teammates jumped into the lead, and at the end of the first lap, Hill led Clark, Gurney, Brabham, Amon, Hulme and Bruce McLaren. On lap two, Gurney moved past Clark for second place, and soon after, Hulme moved ahead of Amon and then his team leader, Brabham. On lap 10, Clark replaced Gurney in second, while Amon began to move forward in the Ferrari. He first got around Brabham, then on lap 21 passed Hulme and Gurney to take third, as the American slowed with a broken suspension.

To everyone&#x27;s surprise, Amon closed the gap to the Lotus pair, but lost four seconds trying to lap Jo Bonnier&#x27;s Cooper. He closed up again, gaining ground in the twisty sections, but losing as they exited the fast corners. The three leaders lapped Jo Siffert and John Surtees, but apparently Surtees objected to Amon&#x27;s hand signals as he did, and the Honda squeezed back ahead of the Ferrari under braking, despite being three laps behind! On lap 61, Surtees developed a misfire, and Amon shot by to take off after the leaders again.

Hill surrendered the lead to Clark when his clutch froze and he was briefly unable to change gear. As Clark pulled ahead, Amon caught Hill on lap 65. While the Englishman struggled to find a gear, the Ferrari went through for second place. Amon, however, suddenly saw his oil pressure drop on lap 76, and Hill regained second place. After eight laps, when Hill&#x27;s Lotus again was unable to select a gear, Amon moved back into second until lap 96, when, after a scintillating drive, his engine finally ran out of oil entirely.
&quot;With Hill too far behind to take up the claim on first he had &#x27;won&#x27; the night before, Clark seemed home free. Then, halfway through lap 106, a support broke on the top of his right rear suspension, causing the wheel to sag inward. The Scot craned his neck around to assess the damage, and began nursing the car toward the finish, taking particular care on left-handers! Hill was 45 seconds back with two laps to run, 23 seconds as they entered the final lap. With both green and yellow Lotus cars ailing, they limped around the last lap. Finally, Clark crossed the line, six seconds ahead of Hill.&quot;
Hulme might have been able to do something about them at the end, but his Brabham&#x27;s engine was sputtering for lack of fuel, and he coasted across in third.

<text>The 1967 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca on 22 October 1967. It was race 11 of 11 in both the 1967 World Championship of Drivers and the 1967 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. 

For the first time in 8 years, two teammates went into the last race with a chance of winning the title. Denny Hulme on 47 points required a fourth-place finish to claim the drivers&#x27; title. Jack Brabham with 42 points needed to win the race and for Hulme to finish fifth or lower.

The race was won by over a minute by Jim Clark, driving for Lotus-Ford, despite not being able to use his clutch during almost the entire race. New Zealander Denny Hulme clinched his only World Championship by coming home third, earning the necessary points to edge out teammate and three-time World Champion Jack Brabham.

<text>The 1968 South African Grand Prix, formally the 2nd AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Tweede AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami Circuit on Monday 1 January 1968. It was race 1 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 80-lap race was won by two time World Drivers&#x27; Champion and 1965 Indianapolis 500 winner Jim Clark for Lotus-Ford after starting from pole position. The race is significant as not only the last Formula One race to be won by Clark, but also the last in which he ever competed, due to his fatal crash at the Hockenheimring in Germany three months later. At this race Team Gunston became the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors instead of national colours when they entered a private Brabham for John Love and an LDS for Sam Tingle.

This was also Mike Spence&#x27;s final race, as he too was killed a few months later, while practising for the 1968 Indianapolis 500.

The first six slots on the grid were filled by either previous or future world champions. However the reigning champion, Denny Hulme, only started in ninth.

Clark broke many records during the weekend, such as leading the most Grands Prix (43), having the most laps led (1,943), having the most perfect weekends (11), achieving the most pole positions (33) and finally achieving 25 race wins, beating Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s 11-year-old record.

<text>The 1968 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jarama Circuit on 12 May 1968. It was race 2 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was the first race after the death of former double World Champion Jim Clark, who had died in a non-championship Formula Two event in Hockenheim, Germany the previous month. Clark had led the drivers&#x27; championship before this race, on 9 points, after he won in the first race in South Africa.

== Background ==
Following Jim Clark&#x27;s death in Germany, and the death of his replacement Mike Spence during practice for the Indianapolis 500 just five days before the race, team principal Colin Chapman opted not to come to Spain for the first championship Spanish Grand Prix since 1954, still being devastated by the losses. Graham Hill was the only works Lotus driver; a second car was entered for Jackie Oliver but could not be set up in time. The race saw the first appearance of Team Lotus in the red, gold and white colors of Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s Gold Leaf brand as their title sponsor instead of the traditional British racing green, making them the first works team (second only to Team Gunston entering a private Brabham car at the 1968 South African Grand Prix) to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors. Jackie Stewart was absent due to a wrist injury he sustained while driving in a Formula Two race, so it was up to Jean-Pierre Beltoise to debut the new Matra MS10.

== Report ==
During qualifying, Ferrari&#x27;s Chris Amon took his first ever pole position with Graham Hill for the mourning Team Lotus down in sixth place.

Lotus fate turned however during the race on Sunday, contested in searing heat. Pedro Rodríguez took the lead at the start in his BRM, followed by Beltoise, Amon and Hulme. The Frenchman moved into the lead on lap 12, only to drop back four laps later with engine troubles. Amon was now back in the lead, followed closely by Rodriguez until the Mexican spun and crashed on lap 28. While he waited for his mechanics to pick up the car, spectators &quot;descended on the car like vultures and stripped off the mirrors, seat, windscreen and nose cowling&quot;. These retirements elevated Hill to second place behind Amon, who suffered a fuel pump failure on lap 58, handing Hill, who had been a mile behind, first place and victory. Hulme was close behind Hill, but when his McLaren lost second gear, he needed to back off and the Englishman cruised home. Beltoise recovered from his mechanical troubles and recorded the fastest lap of the race.

<text>The 1968 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Monte Carlo Circuit on 26 May 1968. It was race 3 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Lotus driver Graham Hill, who started from pole position. Richard Attwood, driving for BRM, gained second place and fastest lap, while Lucien Bianchi finished in third position in a Cooper, in what was to be these two drivers&#x27; only podium finishes.

==Report==

=== Background ===
Following the fatal accident of Lorenzo Bandini a year earlier, the track was altered with the harbour chicane being tightened and the race shortened by 20 laps. Ferrari still chose not to attend the race since they felt the safety measures to be insufficient. While Graham Hill stated Lotus were still &quot;in despair&quot; over the losses of Jim Clark and Mike Spence, the team nevertheless introduced their new Lotus 49B for the race. This race was the first race where wings were used on a Formula One car since the B specifications introduced a wedge shape and a front wing. 1968 would prove to be the season in which wings became a common place on Formula One cars. Jackie Stewart was still sidelined by his wrist injury and was replaced by Johnny Servoz-Gavin, after Ferrari refused to allow Chris Amon to enter for the Matra International team.

Richard Attwood was promoted from Reg Parnell Racing to the BRM works team after Mike Spence&#x27;s replacement, Chris Irwin, suffered career-ending head injuries at the 1000km Nürburgring endurance race. Brian Redman, who had produced a solid performance in the previous race by finishing third, was racing at the 1000 km Spa and was therefore replaced at Cooper by Lucien Bianchi. With the Indianapolis 500 taking place just five days after the grand prix, McLaren&#x27;s Denny Hulme was busy flying back and forth to attend both the Monaco Grand Prix as well as qualifying at Indianapolis.

With France in political unrest, the race organizers borrowed power generators from a local film production company in order to ensure that the tunnel would stay illuminated even in case of a power outage.

The race length was reduced from the traditional 100 laps () to 80 laps () and marked the first time a Grand Prix was shorter than 300 km in scheduled distance.

This was the Formula One World Championship debut for Matra as an engine supplier.

=== Qualifying ===
During qualifying, Graham Hill, a previous three time-winner at Monaco, set the pace and secured pole position 0.6 seconds ahead of the strong Johnny Servoz-Gavin. The Frenchman proved once more the Matra MS10, which had recorded the fastest lap for Jean-Pierre Beltoise in Spain, was highly competitive.

=== Race ===
Johnny Servoz-Gavin took the lead from Hill at the start, while Bruce McLaren took out the other Lotus of Jackie Oliver at the chicane on the first lap. Servoz-Gavin was struck by bad luck on lap 3 when he suffered a drive shaft failure and crashed. This set the tone for the rest of the race, when after a series of accidents and mechanical failures, only five cars finished the race, with everyone from 3rd-place finishing at least four laps down on eventual winner Hill, who cemented his reputation as &quot;Mr. Monaco&quot; by taking his fourth win in the principality. It was however a close finish, with BRM replacement Richard Attwood surprising by finishing just 2 seconds behind the Englishman. Even though Hill broke the Monaco lap record three times during the race, it was Attwood who ultimately recorded fastest lap, the only one of his career. This would also be his one and only podium finish at a Formula One race, just as for Belgian Lucien Bianchi, who finished third. This was the 50th podium finish for Lotus.

Disaster would strike Formula One again just two weeks later as fourth-placed Ludovico Scarfiotti was killed during the Rossfeld hillclimb event.

<text>The 1968 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit on 9 June 1968. It was race 4 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 28-lap race was won by McLaren driver Bruce McLaren after he started from sixth position. Pedro Rodríguez finished second for the BRM team and Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx came in third.

On the seventh lap Brian Redman went off the circuit when his suspension failed and he crashed into and over a concrete barrier and into a parked car. His Cooper caught fire but Redman escaped with a severely broken right arm and a few minor burns.

== Background ==
After the introduction of &#x27;dive plane&#x27; wings on the nosecone on a Formula One car by Lotus at the previous race, the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari added a strut mounted negative incidence wing - to their lead driver Chris Amon&#x27;s car and he nabbed pole position, and was 4 seconds faster in qualifying than the next fastest car of Jackie Stewart, though Amon claimed to have performed similar lap times without the wings. Amon&#x27;s teammate Jacky Ickx did not have wings on his car. The Brabham team also fitted a rear wing to Jack Brabham&#x27;s car, paired with dive planes on the nose to counteract lift; he qualified 10th. Wings were added to Ickx&#x27;s car (and many other teams copied the idea for their cars) for the next race, the 1968 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. As 1968 season progressed many F1 teams utilized strut mounted wings attached directly to suspension elements - copying Chaparral sports car practice - to increase cornering speeds, reducing lap times. Ferrari never utilized strut mounted wings attached to suspension, as Enzo Ferrari considered it far too dangerous, continuing with strut mounted wings mounted directly to the chassis.

<text>Johnny Tremain is a work of historical fiction written in 1943 by Esther Forbes that is set in Boston prior to and during the outbreak of the American Revolution. Intended for teen-aged readers, the novel&#x27;s themes include apprenticeship, courtship, sacrifice, human rights, and the growing tension between Patriots and Loyalists as conflict nears. Events depicted in the novel include the Boston Tea Party, the British blockade of the Port of Boston, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and the Battles of Lexington and Concord.

The book won the 1944 Newbery Medal and was believed to be &quot;among the 20 best-selling children&#x27;s books of the 20th century.&quot; It was estimated to be the 16th-bestselling children&#x27;s paperback book as of the year 2001 in the United States, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. In 1957, Walt Disney Pictures released a film adaptation, also called &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Johnny Tremain is a promising but prideful 14-year-old apprentice at the Boston silversmith shop of elderly Ephraim Lapham. The date is on July 23, 1773. It is understood that someday Johnny will marry Mr. Lapham&#x27;s granddaughter Priscilla to keep the shop within the Lapham family. The shop receives a challenging and urgent order from wealthy merchant John Hancock to make a silver dish to replace one that Mr. Lapham fashioned decades before. While preparing Hancock&#x27;s order, Johnny&#x27;s hand is badly burned when Dove, another apprentice resentful of Johnny, deliberately gives him a cracked crucible that leaks molten silver. Johnny&#x27;s hand is burned and crippled beyond use, and he can no longer be a silversmith. Johnny&#x27;s youthful pride is crushed by the injury. He is relegated to work as an unskilled errand boy. He goes to find a new job that will accept his crippled hand.

After a series of rejections, Johnny reaches the low point of his young life. While searching for jobs, he encounters in a printshop Rab Silsbee, a young typesetter who is friendly to him. He then decides to turn to Mr. Lyte, a wealthy Boston merchant. Johnny explains that his mother told him that he and Mr. Lyte are related and as a last resort, to turn to him for help. Lyte requests the proof, and Johnny shows him a silver cup with the Lyte family&#x27;s crest. Lyte says it was stolen from him in a burglary, and Johnny is accused of the theft and arrested. Eventually, Johnny is freed by the court after Rab brings Cilla to court and she testifies that Johnny showed her his cup before the burglary ever took place.

Johnny settles into a job delivering a weekly newspaper, the Boston &quot;Observer&quot;. The &quot;Observer&quot; is a Whig publication, and Johnny is introduced to the larger world of pre-revolutionary Boston politics by Rab. Johnny learns to ride and care for Goblin, a beautiful but skittish horse used to make deliveries. He moves in with Rab in the attic of the newspaper&#x27;s shop.

As months pass and tension between Whigs and Tories rises, Johnny becomes a dedicated Whig. He matures and re-evaluates many personal relationships, including that with Cilla, who becomes a trusted friend and fellow Whig. Johnny and Rab participate in the Boston Tea Party, in which patriot colonists throw a shipload of tea into the harbor rather than allow the ship&#x27;s owner to unload the tea and pay a tax imposed by Parliament without the consent of the people of Britain&#x27;s American colonies. In retaliation, Britain sends an army of Redcoats to occupy Boston and closes the port, inflicting hardship upon the inhabitants of this commercial and trading town. Rab decides to leave the &quot;Observer&quot; and become a soldier, taking with him a musket that Johnny acquired for him. At the end of the book, Johnny meets and talks briefly with his friend one last time: Facing the British, Rab has been mortally wounded in battle. No longer needing the musket, Rab returns it to Johnny with a stoic smile. A Patriot doctor offers to perform surgery to fix Johnny&#x27;s hand so he can fire the gun against the Redcoats, and the story ends with Johnny&#x27;s acceptance of the offer.

==Characters==
The novel features both fictional and historical characters.
===Fictional===
* Johnny Tremain: The story&#x27;s protagonist. Born Jonathan Lyte Tremain, he is a likable but cocky young teenager, a talented apprentice silversmith indentured at the age of 12 to Ephraim Lapham for seven years. Johnny was born in a convent in France. He returned with his mother Lavinia &quot;Vinny&quot; Lyte Tremain to Townsend, Maine, when she was certain she would no longer be recognized as a Lyte. Because his right hand is badly injured by molten silver, he is forced to seek another trade. 
* Rab Silsbee: Johnny&#x27;s first true friend and role model. He is two years older than Johnny, taller, more mature, resourceful, brave, and admired, especially by Johnny. He does not mind Johnny&#x27;s crippled hand. He introduces Johnny to the politics of Boston, where he is a member of the Sons of Liberty. He treats Cilla kindly, but mostly to tease Johnny. Rab is a Silsbee, known for their dignified aloof reserve, but a fervent, well-spoken Patriot. Rab drills with the Minutemen of Lexington and takes part in the Battle of Lexington where he is mortally wounded.
* Priscilla &quot;Cilla&quot; Lapham: Priscilla Lapham is slightly younger than Johnny. Unlike her older sisters, she is petite and a blossoming beauty. Before Johnny&#x27;s accident, it is arranged that she and Johnny will marry. Over time, Cilla and Johnny developed a genuine love for each other. She is Mrs. Lapham&#x27;s third daughter.
* Isannah &quot;Izzy&quot; Lapham: The youngest daughter of Mrs. Lapham, Isannah is a beautiful but frail child of nine who needs close caring for at all times. Once-sweet Isannah is beloved by her older sister, Cilla, but eventually becomes selfish and vain, with a reputation for parroting other&#x27;s words and not being an independent thinker. Isannah&#x27;s golden-haired, brown-eyed beauty attracts a great deal of attention, most significantly from Lavinia Lyte. Lavinia takes Isannah as her protege and introduces her to high society, separating her from her family and their working class way of life.
* Ephraim Lapham: A British silversmith, and Johnny&#x27;s master at the beginning of the novel. Mr. Lapham is pious and kind, but old, frail, and no longer the master smith of his youth. He dies soon after Johnny leaves his apprenticeship.
* Mr. Percival Tweedie: A 40-year-old from Baltimore, Maryland, who becomes Mr. Lapham&#x27;s business partner after Johnny&#x27;s accident. Mr. Tweedie is a &quot;queer&quot; man, unliked by many. Johnny calls him a &quot;Squeak-Pig&quot;. 
* Mrs. Lapham, later Mrs. Tweedie: Ephraim Lapham&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law. Mrs. Lapham is a dedicated, hardworking mother and a no-nonsense taskmaster to the apprentices. She works as the housekeeper in Mr. Lapham&#x27;s house and shop. When none of her daughters will do so, she marries Mr. Tweedie to keep the silversmith shop in the Lapham family.
* Dorcas Lapham: Mrs. Lapham&#x27;s second daughter. Although the stocky Dorcas longs to be elegant and sophisticated, she falls in love with the poverty-stricken Frizel, Jr., and elopes to avoid marrying Mr. Tweedie.
* Madge Lapham: Mrs. Lapham&#x27;s oldest daughter. Like Mrs. Lapham, Madge is tough and capable. She falls in love and elopes with Sergeant Gale, a British soldier. Madge, like Dorcas, was engaged to marry Mr. Tweedie and elopes with Sergeant Gale to avoid marrying him.
* Dove: An apprentice in the Lapham shop and rival of Johnny whose first name had been forgotten. He is older than Johnny, stupid and given to malicious behavior, and has been an apprentice two years longer but still can only perform menial duties. Dove both resents and looks up to Johnny. He attempts to steal tea during the Boston Tea Party, but is caught and thrown overboard into the harbor. After Mr. Lapham dies, Dove takes a job caring for British officers&#x27; horses during Boston&#x27;s occupation. Johnny despises Dove and cannot bring himself to forgive him as Mr. Lapham counseled, but his thirst for revenge dissipates when Dove is persistently abused by his Redcoat masters.
* Dusty Miller: Mr. Lapham&#x27;s youngest apprentice. Before Johnny&#x27;s accident, Dusty idolized him. After Johnny leaves the silversmith shop, Dusty runs away to sea.
* Mr. Lorne: Rab&#x27;s master and uncle by marriage. Mr. Lorne owns the print shop that publishes the Boston &quot;Observer&quot;, a seditious Whig (Patriot) newspaper.
* Mrs. Jenifer Lorne: Mr. Lorne&#x27;s wife and Rab&#x27;s aunt. Mrs. Lorne sees through Johnny&#x27;s arrogant exterior to treat him as a lonely boy. She becomes like a mother to him and is the mother of an infant son who is unmistakably a Silsbee. Johnny nicknames him &quot;Rabbit&quot;, as a word play on Rab&#x27;s name.
* Jonathan Lyte: A wealthy Boston merchant and Johnny&#x27;s great-uncle. Crooked and cruel, Lyte tries to make a profit by making friends on both sides of the colonial struggle, the Loyalists and the Patriots, but as tensions mount in Boston, Lyte is exposed as a Tory. He becomes gravely ill after his country home in Milton is attacked by a Patriot mob. On the eve of war, Lyte and his family depart for London.
* Lavinia Lyte: Jonathan Lyte&#x27;s beautiful daughter, just returned from living in London. Lavinia is the most desirable socialite in Boston. Enchanted by Isannah&#x27;s ethereal beauty, Lavinia Lyte takes the child away from her family to live amidst the wealth of the Lyte household as a sort of pet. She is also Johnny&#x27;s cousin, which she reveals at the end of the book. 
* Mrs. Bessie: The Lytes&#x27; cook and Cilla&#x27;s only friend in the Lyte household. Mrs. Bessie is an ardent Whig and a confidante of Samuel Adams, but she nonetheless remains loyal to her Tory employers. When the Lytes leave Boston, Bessie and Cilla are left behind to look after their house. Johnny admires Mrs. Bessie.
* Lavinia &quot;Vinny&quot; Lyte Tremain: Johnny&#x27;s mother. She dies before the novel begins. She was born Lavinia Lyte, a name favored for Lyte females, and was a beautiful but impetuously wild young woman. The family turned her out for eloping with Charles Tremain.
* Charles Tremain: Johnny&#x27;s father. Charles Tremain was a French naval surgeon taken as a British prisoner of war during the French and Indian War. While he was held as a prisoner in Boston, using the name Dr. Latour out of shame at being a prisoner, he met and courted Johnny&#x27;s mother. They eloped and were married aboard a ship traveling to Marseilles, France, where Charles died of cholera, and Johnny was born three months later.
* Lydia: The African washerwoman at the Afric Queen, a tavern where many British officers are quartered. Lydia is a rebel sympathizer who, because of her connection to the British soldiers, gathers information for the rebel forces. She is described as handsome by Johnny.
* Sewall: A poor relative of the Lytes who works as a clerk in Jonathan Lyte&#x27;s office. Sewall is kind and brave; he runs off to join the Minute Men.
* Pumpkin: A British private soldier stationed in Boston. Pumpkin is a secret Whig whose dream is to own a piece of land and homestead a farm. Because he is poor, he can only achieve his dream in America. Johnny helps him desert from the army in exchange for his musket, to give to Rab. As a Redcoat deserter, Pumpkin is captured by his former comrades and executed by a firing squad.
* Frizel, Junior: A young leather-dresser, Frizel, Junior is an accepted suitor for Mrs. Lapham&#x27;s two eldest girls, Madge and Dorcas. Refusing to marry Mr. Tweedie, Dorcas runs off to get engaged with Frizel, Junior. 
* Sergeant Gale: A British non-commissioned officer who marries Madge Lapham, Mrs. Lapham&#x27;s eldest daughter. He is noted to be short but tough.
* Lieutenant Stranger: A friendly but often haughty British officer stationed in Boston. He develops a mild friendship with Johnny. He is young, eager to fight, and reminds Johnny a lot of Rab.

===Historical===
;Whigs
* Samuel Adams: Political leader of the Revolutionary forces. He wrote numerous pamphlets inciting and inspiring the revolution.
* John Hancock: One of the wealthiest men in Boston and a leader of the Whigs. Johnny&#x27;s hand is disfigured while making a silver basin for him.
* Doctor Joseph Warren: One of the leaders of the Whigs in Boston. In the novel&#x27;s climax, he is shown preparing to operate on scar tissue in Johnny&#x27;s disfigured hand. Foreshadowing indicates that the operation will be a success, allowing Johnny to enlist in the rebel army.
* Paul Revere: The best silversmith in Boston and an important Whig, known to American history for his midnight ride to caution the Minutemen of approaching British soldiers. He warns the Americans that the British are marching toward them, and they made a &quot;target practice&quot; for them at Lexington.
* James Otis, Jr.: A lawyer and architect of the ideals of the American Revolution; his career was shortened by bouts of insanity caused after being beaten about the head by a British soldier. In the novel, Otis inspires the Whig leaders to fight for the rights of all people, not just Americans. He warns that some will give their lives, foreshadowing the death of Rab.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote, &quot;This is delightful reading, but at the close it seems to leave less sense of substance and permanence than her best work (&quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Paul Revere&quot;), but to me it was more satisfying than &quot;The General&#x27;s Lady&quot; or &quot;Mirror for Witches&quot;.&quot; Common Sense Media said that &quot;this sweeping tale of redcoats and revolutionaries has a lot to offer&quot; and remarked, &quot;Forbes, a historian, writes with detail and precision, imbuing historical events with life and passion that is often lacking in textbooks.&quot;

==Similar characters in other media==
Another Johnny Tremaine (note the different spelling of the surname) was a different fictional character played by Rod Cameron in the 1949 Republic Pictures film &quot;Brimstone&quot;, written by Thames Williamson and Norman S. Hall. This second Tremaine was a U.S. Marshal who goes undercover to stop a cattle-smuggling ring. The release of &quot;Brimstone&quot; followed the awarding of the Newbery prize to the novel &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot;, but preceded the release of the 1957 film &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; by Disney.

<text>The 1968 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Rouen-Les-Essarts Circuit on 7 July 1968. It was race 6 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 60-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx after he started from third position. John Surtees finished second for the Honda team and Matra driver Jackie Stewart came in third.

The French driver Jo Schlesser had a fatal accident on the third lap of the race, when he lost control in the then-new Honda RA302 chassis which overturned and caught fire partially due to its magnesium content. He was chosen as driver when regular Honda F1 driver John Surtees refused to drive the new car, opting for the older RA301 chassis, on the grounds that the new car was unsafe. This race was a turning point in Formula One as the death of Schlesser prompted many safety precautions in later races. 

This was also the last F1 race to take place at Rouen-Les Essarts.

<text>Gold Diggers of &#x27;49 is a 1935 Warner Bros. theatrical animated cartoon short in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series.

==Plot==
In July 1849, in the middle of the dilapidated town Goldville, Little Kitty observes near a gathering, a poster announcing a young prospector Beans about to hunt for gold in Red Gulch. Little Kitty takes the poster and shows it to Porky. Meanwhile, Beans strikes gold from a mountain slot machine, rides off to Goldville and puts the word out, making all the locals leave in pursuit of the gold source. Beans and Porky followed by Ham and Ex head off to the gold source and get digging. Suddenly Beans uncovers a trunk containing a book on how to find gold. Then a greedy bandit spies Beans&#x27; bag of gold and snitches it with a lasso fired from his rifle. Beans pursues the bandit on Porky&#x27;s request hoping to get Little Kitty&#x27;s hand in marriage. After a wild gunfight, Beans supercharges his car dragging the bandit, the bag of gold and Porky along and back to Goldville. Porky reveals that what the bandit stole was in fact his lunch bag.

==Production notes==
&quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot; is the first Warner Bros. animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery, and the second to feature Porky Pig. The star is Beans the Cat, with Porky Pig as the father of Beans&#x27; fiancée, Little Kitty. Looking for suitable characters from the Warners stable to embellish, Avery took two child characters from the previous short &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, turned them into adults, and, as Steve Schlesinger writes, &quot;set the studio on track to making adult cartoons.&quot;

The short&#x27;s title alludes to the California Gold Rush as well as to the popular Busby Berkeley musicals &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot; (also released by Warner Bros).

<text>Christopher Henderson (born December 11, 1970) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a midfielder. He earned 79 caps with the U.S. national team and part of the U.S. team at the 1992 Summer Olympics. At the time of his retirement from Major League Soccer, he was the league&#x27;s all-time leader in games played. Henderson served as the technical director of Seattle Sounders FC from 2008 to 2021. He is the chief soccer officer and sporting director of Atlanta United FC.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Henderson, older brother to Sean Henderson, attended Cascade High School in Everett, Washington. In 1989, he played a single season with the Seattle Storm of the Western Soccer League.

Henderson played two years of college soccer at UCLA, where he helped the team win a national championship his sophomore season. Upon graduating from college, Henderson played for 2. Bundesliga club FSV Frankfurt during the 1994–95 season. He turned down offers from the revived Seattle Sounders and new Seattle SeaDogs to play overseas. After the end of that season, he moved to the Norwegian league, where he trained with Stabæk during the winter. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016.

===Major League Soccer===
At the end of the Norwegian season, Henderson returned to the U.S. and on March 11, 1996, the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer (MLS) named Henderson as a Discovery Player. He immediately stood out by starting 29 games, scoring three goals and eight assists, and being named the Rapids&#x27; team MVP. Henderson spent the next two seasons with the Rapids, registering nine goals and 22 assists over 51 games. He then moved to the Kansas City Wizards for the 1999 season, where he started 29 games, scoring three goals and six assists. Henderson was even better in 2000, scoring nine goals and nine assists as one of the major players in the Wizards team that won the MLS Cup.

He moved to the Miami Fusion for the 2001 season, where he scored three goals and eight assists on a team that went on to win the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield in their final year. Upon Fusion&#x27;s contraction, Henderson was reacquired by the Rapids in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft. Henderson continued to be a threat on the right for the Rapids, scoring 11 goals and seven assists in his first season back. Although he began to show his age in the next two seasons, Henderson continued to be dangerous on the flank. He is the Rapids&#x27; all-time leader with 178 games played, 53 assists, and 120 points. Henderson was traded to the Columbus Crew in May 2005 in a three-team deal. After the season, he was dealt again, to the MetroStars — soon renamed New York Red Bulls — for Tim Ward. Henderson played every match of the 2006 season, and by its end he was the league&#x27;s all-time leader in games played, though he has since lost the title. At the end of the season, however, Henderson was waived. He went on to announce his retirement from professional soccer on December 22, 2006.

==International career==

Henderson earned 79 caps with the U.S. national team throughout the 1990s, beginning with a call-up while still at UCLA. He started in a victory over Iceland and quickly established himself on the national team, seeing time in nearly every game leading up to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He was on the U.S. roster at the World Cup – and the tournament&#x27;s youngest player at 19. Henderson was a member of the U.S. team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Henderson continued to play with the national team until 1998. His last game in the 1990s came in a February 25, 1998 loss to Belgium as the U.S. prepared for the 1998 FIFA World Cup  Henderson did not earn his next cap until October 25, 2000. His next, and final cap, came on September 1, 2001. Over his 79-cap national team career, Henderson scored three goals and ten assists for the United States.

==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement as a player, Henderson rejoined the Kansas City Wizards as an assistant coach for the 2007 season. On January 24, 2008, it was announced that Henderson would be joining the front office of the Seattle Sounders FC as the technical director. Under Henderson, the Sounders reached the playoffs in 12 consecutive years starting with their expansion season in 2009. They have won four U.S. Open Cups, one Supporters&#x27; Shield, and two MLS Cup championships since joining the league.

Henderson was named the chief soccer officer and sporting director of Inter Miami CF on January 18, 2021.

<text>The 1968 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Nürburgring on 4 August 1968. It was race 8 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was held in extremely wet and foggy conditions, and British driver Jackie Stewart, racing with a broken wrist, won the race by a margin of four minutes in what is widely considered to be one of the greatest victories in the history of Formula One.

The race is also notable for Dan Gurney&#x27;s choice of a full face helmet, making him the first driver to do so in Grand Prix racing.

== Report ==

=== Background ===
After Jo Siffert had surprisingly won the previous race at Brands Hatch, the paddock arrived at the Nürburgring almost unchanged. Equally unchanged was the weather: with rain over the entire weekend, this was to be the fifth wet race in a row. BMW entered a Lola-built Formula Two car driven by Hubert Hahne in order to evaluate their competitiveness in Formula One.

=== Practice and qualifying ===
On Saturday, conditions were so poor, with visibility down to mere ten yards, that the organizers scheduled an additional practice session for Sunday morning. Still many drivers slid off the track during the morning session. Eventually, Jacky Ickx took pole positions by a full 10 seconds from second placed Chris Amon, both in a Ferrari. Jackie Stewart in his Matra MS10 was down in sixth place on the grid. At the time, Ickx became the youngest person ever to sit on pole, a record beaten 14 years later when Andrea de Cesaris achieved pole position at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West.

=== Race ===
Even with the conditions treacherous, 200,000 spectators turned up for the race on Sunday afternoon. The race turned out to be a one-man show by Scotsman Jackie Stewart. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start, by the end of the first lap Stewart had moved into first place and built a nine-second lead. He put his superior Dunlop wet tires to great effect and by the end of lap 2, had extended his lead to 34 seconds. When the race ended after 14 laps, Stewart crossed the line more than 4 minutes in front of second placed Hill. The eventual World Champion had spun on lap 11, but was able to get out of the car, push it into the right direction and keep going before third-placed Jochen Rindt could catch up. Chris Amon had battled with Hill for 11 laps over second place, rarely having more than a second between the two, until Amon spun out of the race on the same lap as Hill did.

=== Reactions ===
Stewart described the race as a &quot;teeth gritting effort&quot; in his autobiography. About the first lap he wrote:
The race has been described as Stewart&#x27;s best drive ever, with the Scot later confirming he felt the same way.

== Notes ==

* This was the 100th race for a Lotus. In those 100 races, the British constructor had won 33 Grands Prix, had achieved 52 podiums, 43 pole positions, 35 fastest laps, 12 Grand Slams and had won 2 Driver&#x27;s and 2 Constructor&#x27;s World Championships.

<text>The 1968 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Monza Autodrome on 8 September 1968. It was race 9 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 68-lap race was won by McLaren driver Denny Hulme after he started from seventh position. Johnny Servoz-Gavin finished second for the Matra team and Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx came in third.

There was a five-week break after the previous Grand Prix in Germany. During the break, the Oulton Park Gold Cup attracted some of the top names, with Jackie Stewart taking the victory, after his dominant victory at the Nürburgring.

==Report==

===Entry===

24 F1 cars were entered for the event, the biggest field of the season. American Mario Andretti entered in a third Lotus, while his United States Auto Club (USAC) rival, Bobby Unser, replaced Richard Attwood at Owen Racing Organisation (BRM). Scuderia Ferrari ran a third car for rising English star, Derek Bell, while David Hobbs was fielded by Honda Racing.

===Qualifying===

The early qualifying session saw Andretti and Unser set the pace. Both drivers wanted to fly back to Indianapolis, Indiana for the Hoosier Hundred at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, a 100-lap race on the 1609 metre (one mile) dirt track for the USAC Championship the next day. They then intended to fly back to Milan and race in the Grand Prix. The event organisers announced that if the either driver returned to the US, they would be banned from competing in the Grand Prix, under an ACI ruling which forbade drivers to complete in another event within 24 hours of the start of the Grand Prix. Both drivers flew back to Indiana for the Hoosier Hundred and did return for the Italian Grand Prix, but were not allowed to take part in the race.

Qualifying resulted in John Surtees taking pole for the Honda Racing team, in their Honda RA301, at an average speed of 150.314 mph. He was joined on the front row by Bruce McLaren in his own McLaren M7A and Chris Amon in a Ferrari 312. The second row was occupied by the Ferrari of Jacky Ickx and the Lotus of Graham Hill. Jackie Stewart, Denny Hulme and Derek Bell shared the third row.

===Race===
The race was held over 68 laps of the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, taking place in sunny conditions, with Surtees leading from the start. McLaren and Surtees fought for the lead, until the Ferrari of Chris Amon lost control on oil dropped by one of the Honda RA301s and his car flew over the barriers into the trees at one of the fast Lesmo corners. Surtees also hit the wall trying to avoid the Ferrari. This put Jo Siffert into second place, with Jackie Stewart third. The Scotsman moved into second and a slipstreaming battle developed for the lead between McLaren, Stewart, Siffert and Denny Hulme.

McLaren&#x27;s M7A had to stop for more oil on lap 35 and retired. Stewart retired on lap 43 when his Cosworth engine failed. Hulme was by this stage already leading the race, and when Siffert went out with a rear suspension failure, nine laps from the end, Hulme was left to win. He won in a time of 1hr 40:14.8mins., averaging a speed of 146.284mph. There had been a battle behind him, between Johnny Servoz-Gavin, Jacky Ickx and Jochen Rindt. The Ferrari of Ickx had emerged ahead, only to stop in the closing lap for more fuel. In the process, he dropped to third behind Servoz-Gavin, while Rindt had to retire with an engine failure. Piers Courage, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, and Jo Bonnier rounded out the top six, with no other finishers.

<text>The 1968 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit Mont-Tremblant in St. Jovite, Quebec, Canada on September 22, 1968. It was race 10 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 90-lap race was won by McLaren driver Denny Hulme after starting from sixth position. Hulme&#x27;s teammate Bruce McLaren finished second and BRM driver Pedro Rodríguez came in third.

After the success of the 1967 Canadian Grand Prix, the event was given a place on the 1968 calendar, but was moved from Mosport Park to the Circuit Mont-Tremblant. Attention centred on the battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Graham Hill leading on 30 points, closely followed by Jacky Ickx on 27, Jackie Stewart on 26 and defending champion Denny Hulme on 24.

==Report==

===Entry===
A total of 22 cars were entered for this event, the first of three races in the Americas.

Dan Gurney was present in a third Bruce McLaren Motor Racing prepared McLaren M7A, although entered by his Anglo American Racers team, having given up on his Eagle-Weslake project. Despite this, there was an Eagle T1F in Quebec, in the hands of local Formula A/5000 driver, Al Pease. Another local driver from this series, Bill Brack, appeared in Team Lotus&#x27;s third car. Meanwhile, BRM ran only one car for Pedro Rodríguez. Matra Sports expanded their operation to two cars, with Henri Pescarolo joining Jean-Pierre Beltoise, while Johnny Servoz-Gavin drove a second car prepared by Matra International, following his second place at the previous race in Italy. Alongside Jackie Stewart, this made four Matras in the field.

===Qualifying===
With his Repco engine finally beginning to work, Jochen Rindt secured pole position for the Brabham Racing Organisation in their Brabham-Repco BT26, with an average speed of 101.711 mph. He was joined on the front row by Chris Amon&#x27;s Ferrari 312 and Jo Siffert in Rob Walker&#x27;s Lotus 49B. The fastest McLaren was that of Dan Gurney, qualifying on the second row, alongside the works Lotus of Graham Hill, while the third row featured both of the Bruce McLaren Motor Racing entered McLaren M7As of Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren, sandwiching the sole Honda RA301 of John Surtees.

During qualifying, Jacky Ickx&#x27;s hopes of winning the World title ended when he crashed his Ferrari 312, after the throttle stuck open. As a result, Ickx suffered a broken leg.

===Race===
The race was held over 90 laps of the Circuit Mont-Tremblant, taking place in sunny conditions, with the Ferrari of Chris Amon leading straight from the off, with Jo Siffert chasing him. Then followed Jochen Rindt, Dan Gurney and Graham Hill. The positions at the front remained stable, with John Surtees retiring from eighth place with gearbox troubles. On lap 14, Hill managed pass Gurney, and 12 laps later, the American dropped away with a broken radiator. An oil leak accounted for Siffert, on lap 29, and so Rindt was second, although he too retired shortly afterwards with an engine failure. This promoted Hill to second. That too was short-lived, as he soon dropped behind the McLarens of Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren because of a serious vibration issues. As Hill&#x27;s Lotus 49B gradually fell back, he was overtaken by Pedro Rodríguez and Johnny Servoz-Gavin. A few laps later (lap 71), the Matra of Servoz-Gavin had spun out and Hill was back up to fifth.

While all this was going on, Amon seemed to have everything under control for the first 72 laps of the race, however, on the 73rd lap, his legendary bad luck struck when his Ferrari&#x27;s transmission failed. This gave McLaren a 1-2 victory with Rodríguez grabbing third for BRM. Hulme won in a time of 2hr 27.11.2mins., averaging a speed of 97.799 mph, and was a full lap ahead of his team-mate.

The result put reigning World Champion Hulme level on points with Hill, with two races remaining.

<text>The 1968 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 6, 1968, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 11 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 108-lap race was won by Matra driver Jackie Stewart after he started from second position. Graham Hill finished second for the Lotus team and Honda driver John Surtees came in third. , this is the most recent occurrence of an all-British podium in the sport. This was the debut race of the future world champion Mario Andretti, and his first Formula One pole position.

==Summary==
The first practice day was primarily a duel between Jackie Stewart and the Ferrari of Chris Amon, with Stewart posting the day&#x27;s best time of 1:04.27. Stewart was unable to defend his provisional pole during the second practice day due to a broken stub-axle. However, Graham Hill bumped Amon from the second spot, before Mario Andretti—driving at Watkins Glen for the first time—rewarded the partisan crowd by taking the pole in his Gold Leaf Lotus, 0.07 seconds under Stewart&#x27;s time. This was Andretti&#x27;s first ever Formula One start.

On race day, a huge crowd of 93,000 anticipated a strong home showing with two other Americans also on the grid—Dan Gurney, in seventh, and Bobby Unser, in nineteenth. Stewart used a better start to take the lead on the first lap from crowd favorite Andretti. After the first lap the order was: Stewart, Andretti, Amon, Hill, Jochen Rindt, Denny Hulme, Gurney, John Surtees and Bruce McLaren.

By lap six, Andretti had opened up a gap to Amon and set off for Stewart. Three laps later, the nose on Andretti&#x27;s Lotus was broken, with the right wing dragging on the ground. Andretti said though he had not touched anyone, the body had just cracked. However, he continued without losing his position until lap 13, when his pit crew taped the car back together, and dropped to thirteenth place.

On lap 10, there was a fight for third place as Amon, now behind Hill, spun on his own water spillage. In lap 6, Hulme hit an oil patch, dropping from third to ninth. On lap 26, Gurney, running in third place, did a 360° spin and was overtaken by Surtees&#x27; Honda.

After lap 33, Andretti retired with a broken clutch. Gurney then took over Surtees, as the two battled for the rest of the race. By lap 40, Stewart was 26 seconds ahead of Hill, with Gurney and Surtees another 10 seconds Hill. He then sent a message to the rest of the racers by posting the fastest lap of the race on lap 52, widening his lead to 31 seconds. Hill had struggled for a while with a loose steering column, to which he said he was driving crouched up.

On lap 97, a minute and twenty seconds ahead of Bruce McLaren, Jo Siffert&#x27;s Lotus began to sputter, and he signaled to his pit that he would stop to refuel in the next round. As Siffert then exited the pit lane, McLaren went by into fifth place.

Siffert regained the position after two laps, before which McLaren too had to stop for fuel. Surtees then began to back off when he realised Gurney, just ahead in third place, was slowing down because he had a slow puncture and was also running very low on fuel. Surtees used the opportunity catch up with Gurney&#x27;s McLaren in the last lap, as they both finished a lap down to the leaders.

Stewart led every lap in his Matra-Ford and was threatened only once, when he rounded a corner to find two spectators walking across the track. &quot;It&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ve ever come to running somebody over,&quot; he said, &quot;I missed them by an inch.&quot; It was his first American Grand Prix victory and kept alive hopes for his first World Drivers&#x27; Championship with just one more race to go. &quot;It was the first time in my F1 career I felt I could dictate the pace,&quot; he said, &quot;When I went faster, the field went faster. When I went slower, they went slower. It was an extraordinary moment of realisation.&quot;

The race promoters claimed that Stewart&#x27;s prize of £8,300 for winning the race was the richest in F1 history. Andretti&#x27;s Lotus teammate Hill, also in the running for the season&#x27;s title along with Denny Hulme, finished 24 seconds behind Stewart in second place. This was the most recent all-British podium, .

<doc id="1122397" wikidata="Q743509" url="?curid=1122397" title="Aiko, Princess Toshi">
<text>is a member of the Imperial House of Japan. She is the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan.

Following her birth, the ongoing Japanese imperial succession debate had resulted in some politicians holding a favorable view on rescinding agnatic primogeniture (male-only imperial succession) originally implemented in 1889 and reinforced by the World War II allies on the constitution of Japan. However, once her uncle and the current crown prince Fumihito, Prince Akishino had his son, Hisahito in September 2006, Hisahito became second in the line of succession following his father. Aiko remains at present legally ineligible to inherit the throne and she cannot succeed her father, while debate about the possibility of having future empresses regnant continues.

== Birth==
Princess Aiko was born on 1 December 2001 at 2:43 PM in the Imperial Household Agency Hospital in Tokyo Imperial Palace, the first and only child of the then-Crown Prince and Crown Princess, Naruhito and Masako.

In a break with tradition, the name of the princess was chosen by her parents, instead of by her grandfather, the Emperor Akihito. It was selected from clause 56 of Li Lou II, one of the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius. Aiko, the princess&#x27; personal name, is written with the kanji characters for and and means &quot;a person who loves others&quot;. The princess also has an imperial title, , which means &quot;a person who respects others&quot;.

==Education==
Princess Aiko began her education at Gakushūin Kindergarten on 3 April 2006. She left kindergarten on 15 March 2008 and then attended Gakushuin Primary School. 

On her eighth birthday, it was revealed her interests included writing kanji characters, calligraphy, jump rope, playing piano and violin, and writing poetry.

In early March 2010, Aiko began to stay home from school due to being bullied by boys in her school. Aiko returned to school on a limited basis on 2 May 2010. After returning to school, a senior palace official said that she would attend a limited number of classes accompanied by her mother, upon advice from a doctor at the Crown Prince&#x27;s household.
In November 2011, Aiko was hospitalized with pneumonia. In 2014, she enrolled at the Gakushuin Girl&#x27;s Junior High-school.

In the summer of 2018, she made her first solo trip abroad to attend a summer program at Eton College, United Kingdom. Reports from an unnamed palace source close to the family stated that Aiko provided her mother Masako with emotional support in her new role as empress.

In February 2020 she was accepted at Gakushuin University where she majored in Japanese language and literature.

She graduated on 20 March 2024 and stated that she will &quot;strive to balance my official duties and work... while fulfilling my duties as a member of the Imperial Family.&quot; She wrote her senior thesis on Princess Shikishi and her &quot;waka&quot; (poetry in classical Japanese literature).

==Public life==

From the age of 16, Aiko began accompanying her parents at public appearances. She was ineligible to attend any of her father&#x27;s ascension ceremonies in person as she was still a minor at the time.

On 15 September 2021, Aiko and her parents left the Akasaka Palace and moved to the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

On 5 December 2021, the Sunday after her 20th birthday, she participated in formal coming of age ceremonies wearing a tiara borrowed from her aunt, Sayako Kuroda and was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown by her father, Emperor Naruhito.

She attended the 2022 New Year celebration at the Imperial Palace as her first public event as a working member of the imperial family. Her first press conference took place on 17 March. Her next public outing was on 5 November, when she participated with her cousin Princess Kako of Akishino in a so-called &quot;Gagaku&quot; concert organized by the Imperial Household Agency. On 24 November, Princess Aiko visited an exhibition at the Tokyo National Museum, with her parents.

Aiko visited Ise Jingu offering &quot;tamagushi&quot; to Amaterasu on 26 March and the mausoleum of Emperor Jimmu in Kashihara, Nara to inform his spirit of her graduation from university on 27 March. These were her first solo visits to the shrine and mausoleum. She began work at the Japanese Red Cross Society, of which her mother is honorary president, on 1 April 2024 after graduating from university.

In October 2024 she made her first official solo Imperial visit. She attended a sports competition in the Saga prefecture.

==Succession to the throne==
The Imperial Household Law of 1947 abolished the Japanese nobility; under provisions of this law, the imperial family was streamlined to the descendants of Emperor Taishō. The laws of succession in Japan prevent inheritance by or through women.

===Debate===

The birth of Princess Aiko sparked debate in Japan about whether the Imperial Household Law of 1947 should be changed from the current system of agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture, which would allow a woman, as firstborn, to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne ahead of a younger brother or male cousin. Although Imperial chronologies include ten empresses regnant as female monarchs in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Though Empress Genmei was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō, Genshō&#x27;s father, Prince Kusakabe, was also a member of the imperial dynasty, as the son of Emperor Tenmu, and therefore Genshō was a patrilineal descendant of the imperial bloodline. In addition, Empress Genshō herself was succeeded by her brother&#x27;s son, thus keeping the throne in the same agnatic line; both Genshō and Genmei, as well as all other empresses regnant and emperors, belonged to the same agnatic line.

A government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial succession law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the Diet letting women ascend to the throne in order that the Imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 government panel.

===Birth of male cousin===

Proposals to replace agnatic primogeniture were shelved temporarily after it was announced in February 2006 that the-then Crown Prince&#x27;s younger brother, Fumihito, Prince Akishino, and his wife, Kiko, Princess Akishino, were expecting their third child. On 6 September 2006, Princess Kiko gave birth to their first son, Hisahito, who was third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne at the time of the birth under the current law, after his uncle, the then-Crown Prince, and his father, Prince Akishino. The prince&#x27;s birth provided the first male heir to be born in the imperial family in 41 years. On 3 January 2007, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced that he would drop the proposal to alter the Imperial Household Law.

Surveys have shown 80% public support for a female succession. A &quot;manga&quot; by Kobayashi Yoshinori called &quot;Aiko Tennō ron&quot; (愛子天皇論 &quot;Princess Aiko as Emperor&quot;) has led to debates and also been circulated amongst the members of the National Diet.

<doc id="1122398" wikidata="Q171785" url="?curid=1122398" title="1968 Mexican Grand Prix">
<text>The 1968 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca on November 3, 1968. It was race 12 of 12 in both the 1968 World Championship of Drivers and the 1968 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

This race was to determine the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, contested between Britons Graham Hill in the Lotus 49B-Ford and Jackie Stewart in the Matra MS10-Ford, and defending champion, New Zealander Denny Hulme in the McLaren M7A-Ford. The race was moved back a week so as not to clash with the Mexico City Summer Olympics, which ended on October 26.

Hulme started with a mathematical chance of becoming world champion, but his McLaren broke a rear suspension member early, crashed, and caught fire. Jo Siffert took the lead, but had to pit with a broken throttle cable. Stewart fell back when his engine started to misfire, his car&#x27;s handling began going off, and had a fuel-feed problem. Hill won this race and his second Drivers&#x27; Championship, after Stewart fell back to seventh after an engine problem with his Matra.

The Mexican government&#x27;s effort to curb civil unrest led to a switch from military police to unarmed policemen and track marshals for crowd control; by race end, spectators were encroaching on the track itself. This was one reason for the ultimate cancellation of future Mexican &quot;Grands Prix&quot;.

<text>The 1969 South African Grand Prix, formally the Third AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Derde AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami Circuit on 1 March 1969. It was race 1 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 80-lap race was won by Matra driver Jackie Stewart after he started from fourth position. Graham Hill finished second for the Lotus team and McLaren driver Denny Hulme came in third.

== Background ==

In the weeks leading up to the first Formula One race of the season, entries were being announced for the race, with all the teams, apart from Ferrari expected to nominate two drivers for the race. Enzo Ferrari, the managing director of the team he founded, announced that Ferrari were only going to nominate one driver for the race. To most people&#x27;s surprise, Ferrari at first nominated two drivers for the race without explanation. However, the decision was later changed, with only Chris Amon nominated eventually for Ferrari. Brabham, BRM, Lotus, Matra and McLaren all chose to nominate two drivers for the race meeting.

=== Qualifying ===

*Surtees&#x27;s qualifying time was excluded as he had started at the back of the grid.

== Notes ==

* This was the 100th race for BRM as an engine supplier. In those 100 races, they had won 14 Grands Prix, achieved 56 podiums, 9 pole positions, 12 fastest laps, 2 Grand Slams, and had won 1 Driver&#x27;s and 1 Constructor&#x27;s World Championship.

<text>The 1969 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Montjuïc circuit on 4 May 1969. It was race 2 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

There was a small field for this race, as the famous Targa Florio sportscar race was on the same day. This is one of only two Grands Prix where the winner finished two laps ahead of the runner-up, the other occasion being the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. This was the last race of the high wing era in Formula One. Both works Lotus cars suffered massive accidents when their suspension-mounted wing supports failed. Despite the narrow confines of the Montjuïc circuit, drivers Jochen Rindt and Graham Hill both survived. Chris Amon inherited the lead after Rindt&#x27;s crash. Establishing a thirty-second lead, the New Zealander seemed to be on his way to his first Grand Prix victory until his engine seized on lap 56. The lead was then gifted to Jackie Stewart, who then went on to win by a margin of two laps; one of his most dominant performances, on a circuit that would become synonymous with the danger and lack of professionalism he detested.

== Notes ==

* This race saw the fastest lap set by Jochen Rindt and by an Austrian driver, a first for both.
* This was the fifth Grand Prix win for French constructor Matra.

<text>The 1969 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Monaco on 18 May 1969. It was race 3 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The 80-lap race was won by Graham Hill, driving a works Lotus-Ford, after he started from fourth position. It was Hill&#x27;s 14th and final World Championship race victory, and his fifth Monaco win, a record that would stand for 24 years. It was also the first win for a driver wearing a full face helmet in Formula One. Piers Courage finished second in a Brabham-Ford entered by Frank Williams, with Jo Siffert third in a Lotus-Ford entered by Rob Walker.

This was also the final Formula One race for Cooper as a constructor and Maserati as an engine supplier, Vic Elford finishing seventh and last in a car entered by Colin Crabbe.

<text>The 1969 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Silverstone Circuit on 19 July 1969. It was race 6 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Jackie Stewart was victorious, as he lapped the entire field and took his fifth win in six races.

The race developed as a contest between Stewart and Jochen Rindt who constantly overtook each other by slipstreaming. It was on one of these occasions towards the end when Stewart signalled to Rindt as he drew alongside that the end plate of his rear wing had come loose and was fouling the left-rear tyre each time Rindt flung his Lotus through a fast right-hander. Rindt was able to confirm this in his mirror and was forced to pit. However, his team failed to put enough fuel into the car to enable him to finish the race and consequently he was obliged to make a further stop. The race was also notable for being the only race that Cosworth entered. Their car was withdrawn weeks before the race weekend.

<text>The 1969 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 3 August 1969. It was race 7 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Twelve Formula Two cars were also entered into the race, though they were not eligible to score points.

The 14-lap race was won by Belgian driver Jacky Ickx, driving a works Brabham-Ford. Ickx took pole position, led the final eight laps and set the fastest lap of the race. Scotland&#x27;s Jackie Stewart finished second in a Matra-Ford, with New Zealand&#x27;s Bruce McLaren third in a McLaren-Ford.

==Report==

Gerhard Mitter was killed during a practice session for this race at Schwedenkreuz. He was practicing for BMW&#x27;s &quot;269&quot; F2 project. As a suspension or steering failure was suspected, the BMW team with Hubert Hahne and Dieter Quester withdrew from the race, as did Mitter&#x27;s teammate at Porsche, Hans Herrmann.

Mario Andretti drove the 4WD Lotus 63 for very few laps in practice. The heavy fuel load for the race made the car ground out in lap 1 after a jump at Wippermann, causing a crash that also took out Vic Elford, whose car flipped upside down and landed in the trees. Elford broke his arm in 3 places.

In the race, Jacky Ickx had a very poor start which dropped him down to 9th, but he eventually passed the entire field over 3 laps, and he and Jackie Stewart battled for 4 laps until Ickx passed Stewart at the first corner, the Südkehre. Stewart held on but then gearbox problems began to slow him and he dropped away, leaving Ickx in a dominant position. Piers Courage had an accident at Breidscheid when he slipped on some oil and crashed into a ditch next to the Adenauer bridge. Luckily, he was unhurt.

This was the last Formula One race at the Nürburgring before it was rebuilt and fitted with Armco barriers for the 1971 race.

It was race 9 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 90-lap race was won from pole position by Belgian driver Jacky Ickx in a works Brabham-Ford, with teammate Jack Brabham second and Jochen Rindt third in a works Lotus-Ford.

The race was the last World Championship Grand Prix in which Climax-powered cars were entered. One of the entrants, Al Pease, in an Eagle-Climax, became the only driver in F1 history to be disqualified for driving too slowly. The other entrant, John Cordts in a Brabham-Climax, retired after only ten laps.

By finishing sixth, Johnny Servoz-Gavin became the first (and, as of 2025, only) driver in Formula One history to score points in a four-wheel drive car.

<text>The Coca-Cola Kid is a 1985 Australian romantic comedy film. It was directed by Dušan Makavejev and stars Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi. The film is based on the short stories &quot;The Americans, Baby&quot;, and &quot;The Electrical Experience&quot; by Frank Moorhouse, who wrote the screenplay. It was entered into the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
Becker, a hotshot American marketing executive (played by Roberts) from The Coca-Cola Company, visits their Australian operations in Sydney and tries to figure out why a tiny corner of Australia (the fictional town of Anderson Valley) has so far resisted all of Coke&#x27;s products. He literally bumps into the secretary (played by Scacchi) who is assigned to help him.

Becker discovers that a local producer of soft drinks run by an old eccentric has been successfully fending off the American brand name products. The executive vows an all out marketing war with the eccentric but eventually comes to reconsider his role as a cog in Coca-Cola&#x27;s giant corporate machinery. Along the way there are humorous subplots involving the office manager&#x27;s violent ex-husband, Becker&#x27;s attempt to find the &#x27;Australian sound&#x27;, and an odd waiter who is under the mistaken belief that Becker is a secret agent.

==Cast==
==Production==
David Stratton gave a copy of Frank Moorhouse&#x27;s book &quot;The Americans, Baby&quot; to Dusan Makavejev when he attended the Sydney Film Festival in 1975 with &quot;Sweet Movie&quot;. Production of the movie was difficult in part because of Makavejev&#x27;s work methods, which were different from the way films were normally made in Australia. Denny Lawrence came on board the film as a consultant.

&quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; was shot on location in Sydney and the Blue Mountains.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; a rating of 47% from 17 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said that the movie was &quot;filled with moments of inspiration,&quot; but believed that &quot;the last half of the film [...] does not quite deliver on the promises of the first half.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; grossed $36,365 at the box office in Australia.

==Home media==
MGM Home Entertainment released the Region 1 DVD in the United States on 16 April 2002. Umbrella Entertainment released a region free version in May 2009. The DVD includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, and an interview with Greta Scacchi and David Roe titled &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. Fun City Edition released the film on Blu-ray in the United States on 16 June 2022. In addition to the features included in the 2009 DVD, the Blu-ray contains an interview with Eric Roberts and a new audio commentary.

<text>The 1969 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 5, 1969, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 10 of 11 in both the 1969 World Championship of Drivers and the 1969 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 108-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jochen Rindt after he started from pole position. Piers Courage finished second for the Brabham team and BRM driver John Surtees came in third.

=== Summary ===
Jochen Rindt survived an early duel with newly crowned Champion and close friend Jackie Stewart and claimed his first Grand Prix victory, the first ever by an Austrian. Piers Courage finished second, driving a Frank Williams-prepared Brabham and out-racing Jack Brabham himself and Jacky Ickx in the works Brabhams. John Surtees took third place at The Glen for the second straight year, this time in a BRM.

After five wins in his first four seasons, Jackie Stewart won five of the first six races in 1969, and his first Driver&#x27;s Championship was already in his pocket when the teams came to North America for the final three races.

Jochen Rindt, on the other hand, had flirted with his first victory throughout the season, his first with Lotus, but without success. He had started on the pole four times, led in five of the nine races, and taken back-to-back podiums in the two preceding races in Italy and Canada.

Also driving for Lotus were the previous year&#x27;s Champion, Graham Hill, and American Mario Andretti, making just his third F1 appearance of the season. Andretti was doing his best with the controversial and soon-to-be-abandoned four-wheel-drive Type 63, while Hill and Rindt were in standard 49Bs.

Friday practice was wet and virtually meaningless, except that it showed the four-wheel-drive Matra and Lotus cars had little or no advantage even in the rain, and the concept quickly disappeared from modern GP racing. Saturday was dry, however, and Rindt won the battle for pole, his fifth of the season, beating Denny Hulme&#x27;s McLaren by three-hundredths in the last fifteen minutes of the session. The rest of the top six were Stewart, Hill, Jo Siffert (in a Rob Walker-entered Lotus) and Bruce McLaren.

On Sunday, before a crowd of over 100,000, Rindt jumped into the lead at the start, while Hulme struggled with a bent gear linkage and lost places to Stewart and Hill. Andretti charged ahead from his thirteenth-place grid position, and, when Brabham slowed to avoid Hulme, Andretti bumped rear wheels with the Brabham, knocking the Lotus sideways. Andretti continued for three laps, but his suspension was bent, and he retired. At the end of the first lap, the order was Rindt, Stewart, Hill, Siffert, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Courage and Ickx.

As they had many times during the season, Rindt and Stewart quickly separated themselves from the rest of the field. On lap 12, Rindt slid wide and allowed Stewart through. The Matra&#x27;s engine was not running at full strength, however, and it was all Stewart could do to hold off the Austrian, who was bobbing and weaving on both sides, trying to get by. Rindt finally got past on the straight on lap 21, and eventually, the Scot began to fall back.

On lap 33, Stewart&#x27;s car emitted a puff of smoke, and the next time around, he coasted down the pit lane with no oil pressure. Rindt now led a group of three Brabhams, with Courage ahead of the two works entries of Ickx and Brabham, by 37 seconds. On lap 62, Brabham got by Ickx and began hounding Courage. Several times, the Australian managed to pull alongside, but could not complete the pass. Ickx dropped out of the three-way fight on lap 78 when he suddenly lost oil pressure and pulled to the side of the track.

Rindt was content to maintain his cushion over Courage and Brabham. On lap 88, Hill spun off the track on a patch of oil and stalled. He unfastened his straps, got out of the car and push-started it, but could not refasten his belts alone. His off-track excursion had apparently punctured a rear tire, and he signalled the pit to get ready to change it. Before he made it back around, however, the tire exploded at the end of the straight and sent the Lotus cartwheeling into an embankment. Hill was thrown from the car and suffered broken bones in both legs. Later, at the hospital, he was asked by team members if he had a message to pass along to his wife. Hill replied, &quot;Just tell her that I won&#x27;t be dancing for two weeks.&quot; Hill&#x27;s accident was witnessed by two fifteen-year-old boys from nearby Montrose, Pennsylvania, John Moore and Kevin Hibbard. Their eyewitness account stated that &quot;It looked like the crash was unsurvivable. We thought he had definitely been killed.&quot;

Brabham had to break off his pursuit of Courage when his engine began sputtering for lack of fuel, and he was forced to pit on lap 93, allowing Surtees to get through into third place. Rindt crossed the line 46 seconds ahead of Courage with his long-awaited first win. He said, &quot;It is just that the car held together for once, but this one makes up for all the others I have lost.&quot; Once again, the American race offered a record purse, and the total of $206,000 included $50,000 for the winner.

==Classification==
== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for Canadian driver George Eaton.
* In the 50th official Formula One World Championship Grand Prix for an Austrian driver, Jochen Rindt won his first race with a Grand Slam. It was the first Grand Prix win and Grand Slam for an Austrian driver.

<text>Toyota Racing Development (also known by its abbreviation TRD) is the in-house tuning shop for all Toyota and Lexus (and formerly Scion) cars. &quot;TRD&quot; is responsible both for improving street cars for more performance and supporting Toyota&#x27;s racing interests around the world. TRD produces various tuning products and accessories, including performance suspension components, superchargers, and wheels. TRD parts are available through Toyota dealers, and are also available as accessories on brand-new Toyotas and Scions. Performance parts for Lexus vehicles are now labeled as &quot;F-Sport&quot; and performance Lexus models are labeled &quot;F&quot; to distinguish Lexus&#x27;s F division from TRD.

 there are two official branches of TRD: TRD Japan (a.k.a. Toyota Technocraft) and TRD USA. Each of these branches has both a performance tuning division and a race (or competition) division. In 2018, TRD Japan and Toyota Modellista merged to form Toyota Customizing &amp; Development Co., Ltd (TCD).

TRD Japan&#x27;s Race Division concentrates on the Super GT Series (JGTC), All-Japan Formula Three Championship Series, Esso Formula Toyota Series, and Netz Cup races (Vitz and 86/BRZ Race Series). Many of these activities has been rebranded under the Toyota Gazoo Racing brand, following the merger of TRD Japan into TCD banner.

TRD USA&#x27;s Race Division, known as &#x27;Toyota Racing&#x27;, competes in NASCAR, NHRA Top Fuel and Funny car, IMSA GT Daytona, Pirelli World Challenge TCA, Formula Drift, , USAC, and Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series. Former competitions include the Baja 1000, Grand-Am, CART/Champ Car and the Indy Racing League. In association with All American Racers, TRD USA was responsible for developing engines for the Eagle HF89/90 and Eagle MkIII Grand Touring Prototypes.

TRD is not to be confused with Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG), which is located in Cologne, Germany, and operates Toyota&#x27;s FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) factory team under the name Toyota Gazoo Racing. Within Toyota, TMG is a completely separate entity from, and therefore not under the control of, TRD. Former TMG activities include operating the Toyota Formula One Team (also known as Panasonic Toyota Racing), which competed in the FIA Formula One World Championship (F1). TMG also competed in the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) as Toyota Team Europe with the famous Celica GT-Four and rally versions of the Corolla, and two attempts (in 1998 and 1999) at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with the GT-One.

Toyota Australia introduced a TRD division in August 2007, with the supercharged Aurion V6, followed by a high-performance variant of the 4WD Hilux in April 2008. Speculation suggested a third model was likely to be a RAV4. TRD was aimed to compete with local in-house tuning shops Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) and Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV). However, in December 2008 Toyota Australia announced it would be ceasing production of its TRD range. The decision took effect on 31 March 2009.

==TRD parts==
TRD offers bolt-on headers, sport mufflers, and cat-back exhausts that are 50 state emission legal. Cold air intakes are also sold but not always emission legal. Suspension equipment includes coilovers, springs, dampers and struts, suspension tower braces, sway bars, and wheel upgrades as well. Braking hardware includes full brake kits including calipers, rotors and stainless steel braided brake lines. Separate performance brake pads are also sold. Oil and air filters are offered. Engine head gaskets and camshafts are sold as well. A number of cosmetic modifications are available among other performance equipment.

==TRD supercharged engine list==
When install is performed by a Toyota dealer, the 3/36,000 mile warranty extends to the supercharger, otherwise the vehicle retains the factory warranties and the supercharger is covered by a 12 month/unlimited mileage warranty. As of 2015 all TRD Superchargers have been discontinued and ceased production, but all warranties will still be acknowledged.

==TD2==
Through the TRD brand Toyota since the early-2010&#x27;s has had a driver development program called TD2 which offers training to develop drivers so they can succeed at the top level of motorsports. Drivers currently in the program as of 2022 consist of Chandler Smith, Christian Eckes, Corey Heim, Gracie Trotter, Sammy Smith, Kaylee Bryson, Cannon McIntosh, Presley Truedson, and Daison Pursley. Drivers such as Erik Jones, Christopher Bell, and Harrison Burton have &quot;graduated&quot; from the program and made it to the NASCAR Cup Series which the program preps its drivers for.

Most drivers in the program can be marked by the TD2 logo often seen on the back towards the collar or &quot;neck&quot; of their fire suits and/or the back center of their helmets.

<doc id="1122416" wikidata="Q16108799" url="?curid=1122416" title="Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus">
<text>Two noblemen, an uncle and nephew, who shared the name Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus and were descendants of the Roman Emperor Augustus, lived during the 1st century AD.

== Elder Silanus ==
Silanus (died 49), was the third born son to Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the Junii Silani, a family of Ancient Rome. His maternal grandparents were Julia the Younger, granddaughter of Augustus, and consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Through his maternal grandparents he was a descendant of the Roman Emperor Augustus, the noble woman Scribonia, the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and the consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). He won an honorary triumph and gave a lavish gladiatorial display. He was praetor in 48. The Emperor Claudius betrothed him to his daughter Claudia Octavia, but this was broken off (also in 48) when the Empress Agrippina the Younger, hoping to secure Octavia as bride for her son Nero and also to eliminate a potential threat to Nero&#x27;s prospects, falsely charged him with open affection toward his sister Junia Calvina. This was carried out through the agency of Lucius Vitellius, who was Junia&#x27;s husband. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office. He was forced to commit suicide on New Year&#x27;s Day, 49, the same day that Claudius and Agrippina married.

== Younger Silanus ==
Silanus (50-66) was the son of the elder&#x27;s brother, Marcus. His mother is unknown. After his father&#x27;s murder, he was raised by his paternal aunt Junia Lepida and her husband Gaius Cassius Longinus. A respected young nobleman, he became a rival in his youth to Emperor Nero. Expelled from public life by Nero after his accession to the purple, Silanus was banished to the small country town of Bari (Roman &quot;Barium&quot; in Apulia). Ordered to commit suicide, he chose to fight, and was killed in a standoff with his guards.

<doc id="1122429" wikidata="Q477408" url="?curid=1122429" title="Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation">
<text>Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation (also known as Rocky Boy Reservation) is one of seven Native American reservations in the U.S. state of Montana. Established by an act of Congress on September 7, 1916, it was named after &quot;Ahsiniiwin&quot; (Stone Child, incorrectly originally translated as Rocky Boy), the chief of the Chippewa band, who had died a few months earlier. It was established for landless Chippewa (Ojibwe) Indians in the American West, but within a short period of time many Cree (nēhiyaw) and Métis were also settled there. Today the Cree outnumber the Chippewa on the reservation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) recognizes it (and the tribe) as the Chippewa Cree Reservation.

The reservation is located in Hill and Chouteau counties in north central Montana, about from the Canada–U.S. border. It has a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The reservation reportedly has 3,323 enrolled members, 55% of the total 6,177 enrolled members in the tribe.

==Description==
The reservation was established by congressional statute on September 7, 1916 (39 Stat. 739, Sec. 10), to provide land for the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians, who had been forced out of territory in Minnesota and were landless. The Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation is in the Bears Paw Mountains in north-central Montana. According to the map of Montana, the reservation takes in land within the boundaries of Hill and Chouteau counties, about south of the Canada–United States border. It is the smallest reservation in the state in terms of land area, with a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The population was 3,323 at the 2010 census, an increase of 24 percent compared to 2000. Three other reservations of the seven in the state also had population growth during this period.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x27; Labor Force Report of 2005 reported 5,656 enrolled members in the tribe. The largest community of the reservation is Box Elder, although a small part of Box Elder extends off reservation lands. More than 80% of the tribal enrolled members are classifiable as &quot;adoptees&quot; under the tribal constitution, as they have non-Chippewa tribal origin.

Rocky Boy&#x27;s unusual name was derived from the English mistranslation of the name of the tribal chief, &quot;Ahsiniiwin&quot; (in the Chippewa/Anishanaabe language). His name was closer in meaning to &quot;Stone Child&quot;. The Chippewa who are descendants of Chief Rocky Boy say his name is &quot;Asiniweyin&quot;, meaning &quot;Stone Being&quot;, or &quot;Being of Stone&quot;.

The Department of Interior refers to the Chippewa-Cree Tribe as being the recognized tribe on the reservation, but this is a term of convenience. The Chippewa and Cree peoples are distinct tribes among the several that are part of the larger &quot;Anishinaabe&quot; family.

==History==
Chief Rocky Boy wrote to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and later to President Theodore Roosevelt on January 14, 1902, asking the U.S. government for land, housing, and education for his band of Chippewa Indians, composed of 130 men, women and children. They had been forced out of areas to the east and were landless. Also among landless Indians in Montana were a band of Cree.
Chief Rocky Boy (Ahsiniiwin) worked with Republican Senator Joseph M. Dixon, writer Frank Bird Linderman, and other influential individuals in Montana, including painter Charles Russell, to achieve his goal. He lived mainly in north central Montana, although he also traveled to southwestern and western areas of the state. The Rocky Boy Band was listed at 75 in a 1908 census that was certified by the Department of the Interior. Another 39 were listed separately as affiliated persons but not Chippewa, by agent Thralls B. Wheat, who was responsible for land allotments. 

In 1908, Montana passed the Land Acts, regulating Native American lands. The Swan Valley Massacre of 1908 in the northwest part of the state aroused outrage among Native Americans. A small Pend d&#x27;Oreilles hunting party, which included women and elders, was attacked by state officials while they were hunting off-reservation in their traditional territory. This right was protected by treaties with the US government, but the state thought they had the power to regulate it. An armed game warden confronted the party when he thought they had not moved out of their camp quickly enough and shot at members. Gunfire was exchanged, and a total of four Pend d&#x27;Oreille were killed in the incident, as was the game warden.

In November 1909, over 100 landless Chippewa-Cree from southwestern and western Montana and northern Idaho (including the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indian Reservation) gathered near Helena to be relocated to a new homeland on the Blackfeet Reservation, which was closer to their traditional home. With the new Chippewa-Cree Reservation approved and set aside, the government redirected the Chippewa-Cree to the Chippewa band&#x27;s new home. The new reservation was located between St. Mary, Babb (which is on the Blackfeet Reservation), and the Canada–US border. It was first called the Babb Reservation.

Chief Little Bear soon followed Rocky Boy with his own band, arriving with about 200 Cree from Canada after the North-West Rebellion. According to knowledgeable Blackfeet, the name plates are still discernible, showing the effort to relocate the Chippewa there.

Anishinaabe leaders feared they would lose the land and forced the Chippewa away, as they were not Blackfeet people and were not entitled to allotments. The US Army had allowed the Chippewa and other landless Indians, including Cree refugees, to settle at Fort Assinniboine in Hill County. By 1912–1913 nearly 600 Chippewa and Cree were living on the large Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation. The Rocky Boy Reservation, which was formed in part by land ceded by the Army from Fort Assinniboine. Most of those settled in the area were Cree refugees from Canada in the U.S. under terms of asylum.

Rocky Boy had already supervised his Chippewa band census in 1908 and had it certified by the Interior Department. Chief Rocky Boy was living on the new Chippewa Reservation near Babb, Montana with 50 to 60 people. He negotiated with the US Indian agent for additional lands, which were approved in 1916. Soon after the reservation was officially established, Chippewa and other landless Indians, to include the Cree from north central Montana, western Montana, and northern Idaho, settled alongside those already living on the new Rocky Boy Reservation.

With Frank Linderman leading many of the European-American supporters, the US Congress passed legislation in 1916 to establish what was first called Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation. The Indian Inspector Frank Churchill was sent to Montana to negotiate with the chief. Ahsiniiwin educated Churchill about the Chippewa, saying that they lived all around Montana, including at the Blackfeet and Flathead reservations, as well as near many cities dominated by European Americans, including Anaconda, Billings, Butte, Deer Lodge, Great Falls, Havre, Helena, Missoula, Wolf Point and others. Ahsiniiwin asserted that he was peaceful at all times, and he spoke only for the Chippewa people. He had worked to establish Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and signed the 1889 Red Lake Agreement in Minnesota.

Churchill asked the Department of Interior to withdraw all of Valley County from white settlement in order to establish a new closed Chippewa reservation there. Both requests were granted by the Department of Interior. In the end, many of the Chippewa-Cree who lived in western Montana were not willing to relocate to far northeastern Montana. Chippewa notation: The Sharrock report/addendum to the official Ewers Report notes the 1908 land was proposed for &quot;Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians&quot;.

Chippewa notation : According to the papers of Indian agent Frank Bird Linderman (1869-1938), Chief Rocky Boy died at Ft. Assiniboine on April 18, 1916. Contemporary newspapers also reported that Rocky Boy died in Fort Assiniboine.

But Robert Gopher (Blackfeet), an oral historian of the Chippewa, says that Rocky Boy was assassinated by rival Cree who used poison roots. They were anxious to settle at the reservation. According to the oral traditions of the Saskatchewan Cree, Little Bear was known to use a specific poisonous root to kill political rivals. If the assassination account is true, it threatened the Cree settlement at Rocky Boy Reservation. Linderman supposedly said that rocky Boy in his last words said he did not want to accept the Cree on the newly established reservation. But they had already been occupying land in the area and at Fort Assiniboine.

In 1917 a census was conducted at Rocky Boy Reservation in order to establish a tribal roll for what became known as the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Chippewa notation: James McLaughlin, the Interior Agent who entered errors on the 1917 tribal roll, is the same agent who sold Rocky Boy&#x27;s land in Thief River, Minnesota. The proceeds of that sale were distributed to the Chippewa people of Red Lake, who were established on a reservation of that name.

== Chippewa Cree Tribal Buffalo Pasture ==
For cultural and food sovereignty purposes, a buffalo herd was established in 2021 on . Bison is the correct taxonomic term for American bison, but buffalo is the common vernacular term. Surrounded by of fencing, the Pasture is about a mile from Box Elder, Montana. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes donated five bison and American Prairie donated six. In 2022, they received ten bison from American Prairie to strengthen the herd.

==Economic development ==
According to the Tribal Chairman&#x27;s address to the Havre Area Chamber of Commerce in January 2007, the annual tribal revenue of $52 million is infused into the local economy as a result of federal programs, private business, and tribal businesses on the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation. The majority of reservation residents work for the self-governing Chippewa Cree Tribe. Compacts are maintained with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Service. Funds originating within the BIA [note: there is only one BIA employee at Rocky Boy due to the self-governance compact], together with tribal government, provide work for 231 full- and part-time employees.

The tribe has set up the Chippewa Cree Community Development Corporation, which employs 25 people. Other enterprises include Chippewa Cree Construction Company (20), Chippewa Cree Construction Corporation (14), National Tribal Development Association (9), Northern Winz Casino (70), and RJS &amp; Associates (4),

The tribe operates and administers its own educational system: the Rocky Boy public schools with 184 teachers and staff. Like other tribes, it has set up a tribal college, known as Stone Child Community College, which employs 57.

It also has services for enrolled members, and operates the Chippewa Cree Housing Authority (25 employees). By the Tribe&#x27;s compact with the Indian Health Service, it employs 135 staff within the Rocky Boy Health Board.

In 2011, the tribe began a new business with Plain Green Loans, an online lending company. It had a staff of 25 as of December 2011. Plain Green and similar companies owned by other tribes have been criticized for profiting from high-interest online loans (called predatory lending). The Chippewa Cree are part of the Native American Lending Alliance, an organization of tribes that are in the business of online lending.

===Northern Winz Casino===
The Chippewa Cree tribe operates the Northern Winz Casino. Construction began in May 2006, with the tribal grand opening occurring in February 2007, and a public grand opening March 30, 2007. The casino is located on U.S. Highway 87, east of Box Elder, Montana.

===Chippewa Cree Business Committee===
The Business Committee is effectively the Tribal Council and the governing body of the Tribe; it is dominated by Chippewa Cree adoptees. The eight council members and chairman are elected at large; they serve four-year terms on staggered schedules of elections. This type of election means that each candidate must gain a majority of votes on the reservation, leaving the minority Chippewa without representation.

The Tribe elected to &quot;consolidate&quot; the Bureau of Indian Affairs (FY 93) and Indian Health Service (FY 94) programs under Title IV of the P.l. 93-638 Act. This act gave more power to the tribes to determine their priorities and exercise governance.

==Religious institutions==

The Chippewa follow the peace pipe religion, rooted in the Grand Lodge or &quot;Mediwiwin&quot; society. They do not accept the use of peyote in their rites. The Chippewa reject all forms of Christianity. The grand lodge tradition is tightly held; it takes a lifetime for qualified members to learn all four levels of the society.

While most of the Chippewa-Cree are Christian, some members of the tribe have maintained traditional spiritual beliefs and cultural ceremonies/activities. The traditional Thirst Dance, more commonly known as the Sun Dance, is held the first week of July. The annual Pow-Wow is held the first week of August. Other cultural events are held throughout the year, including an annual Christmas Dance, round dances, ceremonial feasts, revived cultural ceremonies, and cultural camps.

Feeling displaced in Rocky Boy, the Chippewa have continued to practice their traditions on Hill 57, outside Great Falls, Montana. The practices had centered around Mary Chippewa Gopher, whose spiritual name was &quot;Iron Claw Bear Woman&quot;. She was the niece of Chief Rocky Boy. Her father, Charles Chippewa or Walking Stone, was the brother to the chief. Mary Chippewa married Jim Gopher, or Loud Thunder.

(notation: In the BIA technical report on the Little Shell: &quot;the Chippewa included a small and distinct group, centered around the Gopher family, some of whom are still resident of &quot;hill 57&quot; today. This group claimed descent from a Chippewa chief from the Great Lakes area. They were identified in the studies of the &quot;Hill 57&quot; as descendants of a Chippewa band from the Great Lakes, unrelated to the Little Shell families, Turtle Mountain, or the bands on the Rocky Boy&#x27;s reservation). This is accurate in the sense that the Chippewa were not related to the Little Bear Cree who also occupied the reservation since it was established.

Currently the four levels of teachings of the sweat lodge are held by descendants of Robert Gopher, who was the youngest son of Jim and Mary Chippewa Gopher. The family are not the only ones to carry the intricate teachings and knowledge of their predecessors.

Various Christian churches have become established at the reservation. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has a mission, Our Saviour&#x27;s Lutheran Church. Toward the end of 1999, Rev. Joseph W. Bailey Sr. was joined by Christian youth groups from around the country; together they built a new sanctuary and outdoor chapel, and started work on a retreat center.

In December 2019 the original St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church burnt down. In June 2021 the community held a groundbreaking ceremony to start the rebuild of the new church.

The Baptist mission church was established in late 1999. The church building was erected in June 2002. The Rocky Boy Assembly of God Church is self-governing and self-supporting. Eric and Amanda Reed have shared the senior pastor in Rocky Boy in the Spring of 2006.

==Communities==
Rocky Boy Reservation has nine settlements, eight of which are classified by the US Census Bureau as census-designated places (CDP). Most of the CDPs are located in the Bear Paw Mountains.

* Agency (official CDP name is &quot;Rocky Boy&#x27;s Agency&quot;) - population 355 at the 2010 census
* Azure - located in the Bear Paw Mountains
* Boneau - located 7 miles east of Box Elder, near the Bear Paw Mountains
* Box Elder - population 87 at the 2010 census; located on the plains
* Parker School
* Rocky Boy West, or New Box Elder - population 890 at the 2010 census; located on the southeast side of Box Elder, on the plains
* Saint Pierre - population 350 at the 2010 census
* Sangrey - situated at the edge and just within the Bear Paw Mountains

In addition, a new settlement is sited about 3 miles west of Boneau, with around 23 housing units.

Hill 57 was a settlement where members of the Rocky Boy band moved after they had lost several dozen family members from starvation on Chief Mountain. Opponents of tribal termination noted the problems of the settlement, which occurred after allotment of communal lands had left members disadvantaged. A land plot inherited by Robert Gopher was obtained by George Black Tongue. He had been barred from the 1908 roll and should not have been eligible to acquire that land.

The settlement at Hill 57 followed the dark period when some members of the Rocky Boy Band were assassinated; tribal members left the reservation to preserve themselves. The Chippewa Cree Tribal Constitution was passed that adopted a ten-year absentee policy, wherein members away from the reservation for longer than 10 years lost their tribal citizenship. In the early 21st century, the Chippewa are studying suing the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council. They contend that the Chippewa Cree are not a lawful recognized tribe. They believe that the tribal immunity from civil suits does not apply to individuals who do not have blood descent in a historic tribe, but claim adoptee status on a reservation.

==Climate==
Rocky Boy Reservation has a wide variation of climate conditions. Near Box Elder, the climate is warmer during the summer months, as a result of the lower elevation, and windier during the cold winter months. During the cold winter months, the Chinook winds can cause damage around the Box Elder region. High wind storms often occur during the winter months. With the warmer temperatures, the Chinook Winds result in melting snow. The Chinook Winds also occur in the Bear Paw Mountains, but their strength there is not as great as on the open plains. The winds may warm the communities located in the Bear Paw Mountains during the winter months. Precipitation, especially in the form of snow, is somewhat higher in the mountains than on the plains.

Average low temperatures during the winter months of December, January, and February at Box Elder are 9, 5, and 9. Average high temperatures for the same winter months at Box Elder are 30, 26, and 31. Average high temperatures for the summer months of June, July, and August are 76, 85, and 84. Average low temperatures for the same summer months at Box Elder are 49, 54, and 51.

==Notable Chippewa, Anishinaabe==

*Chief Rocky Boy, or &quot;Asiniweyin&quot; (as his name appears on the 1908 Chippewa Census, &lt;United States Department of Interior&gt;), member of the Red Robe Band noted in the 1864 Pembina Chippewa Treaty, signor of the 1889 Red Lake Agreement #6, assisted in the creation of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation. With Frank B. Linderman, Charles M. Russell, Paris Gibson, and William Boles (according to the &quot;Great Falls Tribune&quot;), he established the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation.
*Charles Chippewa, brother to Chief Rocky Boy, was at one time the keeper of the Chief Rocky Boy bundle. This bundle is now kept by a descendant of the Rocky Boy family.
*John Goodrunner (Chippewa), coordinated the annual Rain Dance, sometimes referred to as the Sun Dance, at the Rocky Boy reservation until his death.
*Mary Chippewa Gopher, &quot;Iron Claw Bear Woman&quot;, niece of Chief Rocky Boy, she led Chippewa resistance against policies of the U.S. government that interfered with tribal sovereignty. Also known as Iron Claws, she raised a family at Hill 57 after her people were dispossessed from their new reservation. She rejected inclusion of Cree on the reservation. She led her people from 1946 until her death on November 23, 1965.
*Mary Bearwalker McGillis, daughter of Chief Big Rock&#x27;s son Bearwalker, was a contemporary of Iron Claws. She is also credited with holding the Chippewa people together through a difficult period.
*Duncan Standing Rock Sr., elder and possessor of ceremonial knowledge of the Chippewa people. He held the sacred bundle of Chief Rocky Boy until his death, February 28, 2021.

Robert Gopher, Listening Thunder, grand-nephew to Chief Rocky Boy, led the Chippewa resistance after the death of his parents, and fostered the Chippewa people&#x27;s efforts to restore their sovereignty.

==Notable Chippewa-Cree ==

*Black Powder (c.1800 - d. 1865) was an Ojibwa &quot;ogima&quot; (leader). His date of birth is not known but may have occurred between 1800 and 1805. Ogima Black Powder was native to the Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan regions. Little has been recorded about his life. He died in 1865. Chippewa notation: Black Powder is not on the 1908 Census of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa Indians.
*Big Bear (1825-c. 1888). According to historians, Big Bear was Saulteaux but raised as a Plains Cree. He was born in 1825 as the son of Black Powder, an Ojibwa chief, and an Ojibwa mother in the Jackfish Lake region of Saskatchewan, a few miles north of present-day North Battleford, Saskatchewan, and not far from Alberta. He settled primarily in the region where the present-day Saulteaux First Nation of Saskatchewan is located, near the Onion Lake First Nation. He was a leader in the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The whites arrested him as the principal leader of the short rebellion and sentenced him to prison. In early 1888, Big Bear was released. He settled on the Poundmaker First Nation, where he died soon after. Chippewa notation: Big Bear was not a predecessor to Chief Rocky Boy, for whom the Rocky Boy Reservation is named.
*Little Bear (c.1850-1921). The son of Big Bear, considered Cree. Some said his mother was a Chippewa whose people had relocated from Wisconsin to Montana. Little Bear was born around 1850. After his father relocated to Montana from Idaho, the family settled in southwestern and north central Montana, depending on the season. The latter had vast herds of buffalo and was extremely important to native people. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) had reported seeing the largest buffalo herds in the region from present-day Great Falls to north of the area where the Rocky Boy Reservation is located. Little Bear was one of the principal Cree leaders who fought in the 1885 North-West Rebellion in Canada. He was accused of taking part in the Frog Lake Massacre, along with &quot;ogima&quot; Lucky Man. After the short conflict ended, Little Bear fled as a refugee from Canada back to Montana. Little Bear was said to be the instigator of the Frog Lake massacre in Frog Lake, Saskatchewan in 1885.

Little Bear&#x27;s involvement in the Frog Lake Massacre is the subject of the book, &quot;Blood Red The Sun,&quot; by William B. Cameron, among a handful of captives taken by the Cree band, which continued to elude Canadian law authorities. Cameron was a clerk for the Hudson Bay Company. He later testified on behalf of Little Bear&#x27;s father, Big Bear, who attempted to stop his son and supporters from instigating the massacre. Cameron identified Little Bear as the leader of the massacre, in which a total of nine were killed, including clergy. Some contemporary writings blamed Wandering Spirit. Cameron was held hostage by the Little Bear Band for two months. Little Bear&#x27;s band fled to Montana, but they were subject to deportation to Canada in 1896 by the U.S. Congress. The newspapers reported that the Little Bear Cree forced the U.S. Cavalry back to Havre, Montana and had returned to their homeland when the troops returned from Canada.

There were two distinct rolls, the 1908 census of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa, was conducted near Helena, MT by Thralls B. Wheat, an allotting agent of the Department of the Interior. This was the only legal census of the Rocky Boy Band; it was supervised by Chief Rocky Boy. Neither Little Bear, nor members of his band appear on this roll.

In 1914, Chief Rocky Boy was corresponding with Interior Secretary Franklin Lane, and expressed the Chippewa band&#x27;s neutrality in the World War I conflict. He also wrote to President Woodrow Wilson, dated September 25, 1914, expressing the band&#x27;s position. No Chippewa Cree tribe existed at the time; official correspondence refers only to Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians. Chief Big Rock enacted his own Chippewa council following Rocky Boy&#x27;s death, consisting of Pat Raspberry, Standing Rock, Charles Mosney, and Crazy Boy. This council held a formal council and pipe ceremony in Great Falls with white supporters: writer Frank B. Linderman, Theodore Gibson, William Boles, and painter Charles M. Russell.

By the start of the 20th century, Little Bear returned to Montana, his native country, and began to follow Rocky Boy. In 1905, Little Bear contacted Canadian leaders to request allowing the Cree from Montana to relocate to Canada. Officials agreed and the Cree settled primarily with the Onion Lake First Nation and the Samson First Nation (this reserve includes the Ermineskin, Louis Bull, and Montana First Nations). In 1908, Little Bear again contacted Canadian leaders requesting permission for more landless Chippewa and Cree to relocate from Montana to Canada.

After the Rocky Boy Reservation was officially established in 1916, Little Bear followed Rocky Boy and his band there, bringing about 200 of his own people. He took over as leader of the new Reservation after Rocky Boy&#x27;s death in 1916. Little Bear died in 1921. Ultimately Little Bear Cree and those descendants of the Riel Rebellion leaders made up 406 of the McLaughlin Roll. Only 45 of those who were on the 1908 Wheat roll managed to secure membership at the Rocky Boy&#x27;s reservation, which had been authorized for Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians.&quot; &lt;64th Congress&gt;: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act approved February eleventh, nineteen hundred and fifteen (Thirty-eighth Statutes at Large, page eight hundred and seven), entitled &quot;An Act authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to survey the lands of the abandoned Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation and open the same to settlement,&quot; be, and the same is hereby, amended by the addition thereto of the following sections:

&quot;SEC. 10.
That fractional townships twenty-eight north, ranges fifteen and sixteen east, and fractional townships twenty-nine north, ranges fourteen and fifteen east, Montana principal meridian, within the boundaries of said reservation, embracing a total area of approximately fifty-six thousand and thirty-five acres, are hereby set apart as a reservation for Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewas and such other homeless Indians in the State of Montana as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to locate thereon, and the said Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to allot the lands within the reservation hereby created under the provisions of the general allotment Act of February eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven (Twenty&quot;fourth Statutes at Large, page three hundred and eighty-eight), as amended.

Cree nativity to Montana is disputed by Chippewa who contend that during the negotiations of the treaties that encompass the area of Montana, the noted Smithsonian ethnologist, John C. Ewers found not a single member of Little Bear&#x27;s band, who were now on the 1917 McLaughlin Roll of the US. Department of the Interior; were born in the treaty land cede area. Therefore, the U.S. Indian Claims Commission dismissed Cree treaty claims &lt;Docket 191 221, U.S. Claims Commission&gt;. Still further, the Canadian Council Privy attempted to work with U.S. authorities to exert authority to return the Little Bear Band to Canada, prior to the 1896 Act of Deportation.

*Rocky Boy (c.1852-d. 1916) &quot;Asiniweyin&quot;, more correctly called Stone Being. The true origin of Asiniweyin, he was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. He was a member of the Red Robe Band, Red Robe, or Moose Dung, was a signor of the 1864 Pembina Treaty. Other sources say he was born in Wisconsin and migrated to the Montana region in the 1880s. Rocky Boy claimed to be native to southwest Montana and may have lived in southern Idaho. He became a popular leader in the early 1900s among both the Chippewa and the European Americans. He managed to gain Executive Orders by United States presidents to set aside land for two Chippewa-Cree reservations in northeastern Montana. Rocky Boy died in 1916, before Congress officially established the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation. Some sources have speculated he was assassinated, including noted Smithsonian historian and expert on Plains tribal culture, John C. Ewers. Frank Bird Linderman&#x27;s correspondence with Chippewa Chief Big Rock also indicated Big Rock explained not only Rocky Boy&#x27;s assassination, but Big Rock&#x27;s own son&#x27;s were also assassinated by rival Cree in the Ft. Assiniboine area in the days after Chief Rocky Boy&#x27;s death.&lt;Linderman Papers, Plains Indian Museum, Browning, MT&gt;
*Pennato: The brother of Rocky Boy, Pennato had suggested that the Fort Assinniboine Military Reservation become a new closed Chippewa-Cree Reservation. In December 1911, Pennato and 150 Chippewa fled the Babb Chippewa Reservation. (Source needed).

With respect to enrollment in Rocky Boy, because the reservation was established by an Act of Congress for &quot;Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians and such other homeless Indians,&quot; the language of the law was intended in 1908 by Chief Rocky Boy and Thralls B. Wheat, to leave the door to enrollment open to his brethren who were away on a hunt at the time of the Wheat Census. &lt;Chippewa oral history of the Robert Gopher family&gt;. The Chief Big Rock family were away as was often done, Chippewa bands separate during hunting excursions, hunting in western Montana. Because they were not directly enumerated in the Wheat census, Chief Rocky Boy inserted the language of the Act to include Big Rock&#x27;s extended family. The language of the Act was not intended to include anyone other than the whole Rocky Boy band, and was limited to Big Rock&#x27;s family. Ironically, Big Rock is listed on the 1917 McLaughlin census. Chief Big Rock&#x27;s place of birth is listed as Red Lake, Minnesota. This is the true and legitimate successor to Chief Rocky Boy. Some oral history has indicated Big Rock was Chief Rocky Boy&#x27;s brother, moreover, Chippewa have held Big Rock to be the main &quot;ogemaw&quot; and Rocky Boy was more of a spokesman to him, or a sub-chief. Only the present day Bearwalker family line are the living descendants of Chief Big Rock. After Little Bear took over the affairs of the soon to be established reservation, and the flight to Chief Mountain—Big Rock&#x27;s family perished on Chief Mountain, from the combined effects of tuberculosis and starvation.

Chief Rocky Boy had been under increased pressure to add the Cree and Metis to his rolls by government officials. Even after the reservation was to be created, in the spring of 1916, Frank Bird Linderman met with Chief Big Rock in northside, Great Falls, and other Chippewa tribesmen including Standing Rock, Pat Raspberry, Crazy Boy (Chief Rocky Boy&#x27;s brother), and Charles Mosney. On his death bed, and his last letter to Frank B. Linderman, Rocky Boy stated &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I will ever see you again, Little Bear (referring to their inclusion, along with Metis led by Kennawash)... is trying to get them all in. It is up to my band of Chippewa Indians to let them in.&quot; Rocky Boy&#x27;s understanding of the working of tribal sovereignty is correct. &lt;Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832)&gt;.

There is a legal theoretical split, those that attempt to document and claim a Chippewa Cree identity, and the original descendants of Rocky boy&#x27;s Chippewa band who reject these claims.

The Chippewa view the Department of the Interior&#x27;s mishandling of the 1908 roll, the raising of an illegal 1917 McLaughlin Roll, and the mismanaged Pembina judgments as overreaching paternalism roundly rejected by the majority of U.S. tribes into one tribe&#x27;s affairs. Ewers wrote &quot;it will be for courts to decide if a Chippewa Cree tribe existed prior to 1935,&quot; foretelling the contemporary conflict. To the trained ethnologist&#x27;s eye, the writing was on the wall 40 years ago. Ewers also correctly predicted this matter would ultimately be decided on contentious terms, most likely the courts.

The constitution provides for enrollment for a member of the &quot;Chippewa Cree Tribe.&quot; Namely, the Constitution allows any Indian not otherwise enrolled in MT, to enroll,&quot; unofficially, it allows any Indian who has simultaneous enrollment in Canada to enroll &lt;BIA Area Director Keith Beartusk&gt; It unofficially provides for Cree blood quantum, even though the Cree tribe does not have a U.S. treaty.

==Band of Chippewa Council==

In late 2014, Glenn Gopher, an oral historian and enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe, of Great Falls, Duncan Standing Rock Sr., and Rocky Boy Jr. Slimjohn (Deceased: 02/16/2017), of White Swan, Washington, oversaw the effort of the Rocky Boy Band of Chippewa to assert their sovereignty in a historic return to self-government. Former members of the Business Committee had committed extensive embezzlement and were convicted of theft. The Chippewa people asserted that their sovereignty had been thwarted by extensive mismanagement by the Department of the Interior since historic times.

The Chippewa have begun extensive efforts to reach out to the Billings Area office of the BIA to restore self-government. Under the Obama Administration&#x27;s new Guardians Project, administered by the Department of Interior, there had been increased enforcement through investigation and prosecution of crimes. The convictions of the Adoptee Business Committee resulted from such prosecution.

The Chippewa people never approved the constitution as passed by the Business Committee. The constitution does not provide for specific Chippewa representation in the tribal electoral system. Chippewa are outnumbered on their own reservation by a 10:1 ratio. This threatens the political integrity of the band, and the Chippewa people are working to address it. intend to address.

The Chippewa people are working to address enrollment and voting abuses on the reservation. Most recently, Fr. Pete Guthneck, a non-Indian honorary tribal member, voted in the tribal election, thereby invalidating the election. His standing was challenged by Jonathan Windy Boy, an adoptee who is not a direct descendant of the tribe.

The Chippewa will enforce their right to conduct an audit after pervasive abuse of the tribal enrollment system, and the presence of outright fraud on the part of the Business Committee and the Interior agency who have colluded to strip the Chippewa people of sovereignty. The interim council consists of blood descendants of the Blackfeet Tribe, Browning, Montana, and of the original Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa Indians, who will audit the largely adoptee roll. The proposed interim council consists of Glenn Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; Duncan Standing Rock Jr., Chippewa Cree Tribe; Blair Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; Delores Chippewa, Chippewa-Cree Tribe; Nora Nelson, Chippewa Cree Tribe; Barbara Standing Rock, Chippewa Cree Tribe; Melinda Gopher, Blackfeet Tribal member; and Calvin Twoteeth, Chippewa Cree Tribe (pending).

<text>Miss Venezuela (Spanish: &quot;Organización Miss Venezuela&quot;) is a Venezuelan beauty pageant operated by the Cisneros Group. Founded in 1952, it currently selects Venezuelan representatives to Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss International. The current national director of Miss Venezuela is Miss Universe 2013 Gabriela Isler.

The current Miss Venezuela is Stephany Abasali of Anzoátegui who was crowned on 5 December 2024 at the Centro Comercial Líder in Caracas, Venezuela.

== History ==

On 7 May 1905, Manuela Victoria Mujica Antich of Lara, was elected by popular vote as &quot;Miss Venezuela&quot;.  Many authors and scholars in the history of the Miss Venezuela contest consider her as the first Miss Venezuela ever, and its vote as a precursor of the current national pageant.

=== Miss Venezuela (1952 - 1981) ===
The Miss Venezuela pageant was officially founded in 1952 by Pan Am and businesswoman Gloria Sánchez, for selecting a Venezuelan representative for the Miss Universe pageant in Long Beach, California.

The speed with which the contestants were chosen for that first contest would characterize its first editions, in which parades with different outfits were held over the course of a week or more in different locations in the country. Due to protests by religious organizations at the time, the swimsuit parades were held in private, witnessed by jurors only. Eventually, Venezuela&#x27;s representatives to Miss World (since 1955) and Miss International (since 1960) would also begin to be elected.

After a first interruption in 1954 during the Marcos Pérez Jiménez dictatorship, Pan Am ceded the rights to the contest in 1955 to Venezuelan journalist and musicologist, Reinaldo Espinoza Hernández.

Hernández, who despite the triumph of Susana Duijm in Miss World 1955 (first Hispanic American to win at one of the Big Four international beauty pageants), faced protests by the Venezuelan Catholic Church and feminist movements, which added to the lack of interest by the press of the time. In addition, a second interruption in 1959 caused by the 1958 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état, led to the sale of the contest to Edwin E. Acosta-Rubio, a Cuban-Venezuelan businessman in 1962.

Business-minded, Acosta-Rubio immediately changed the format of the competition. Turning the semi-improvised tourist pageant into an organized annual institution. In order to choose the contestants with professional and responsible criteria, Acosta-Rubio created the so-called &quot;Venezuelan Beauty Committee&quot;. Developed the publicity projection of the event and broadcast it for the first time on television in 1962, through the RCTV network, began to charge for tickets for the finals. With all these changes accomplished in the late 1960s, the Miss Venezuela contest began to be a favorite and traditional reference among Venezuelans, in the Venezuelan popular culture and more importantly, for Acosta-Rubio, as a profitable and appreciated business.

In 1968, the swimsuit and evening gown portions of the show were broadcast on television for the first time. Although it was not of great importance at the moment, Osmel Sousa began to work in those years as a graphic and fashion designer for the contest.

In 1969, Ignacio Font Coll, brother-in-law of Edwin Acosta-Rubio, who was the creator and president of OPPA Publicidad, appointed him as director of the current Miss Venezuela Organization.

Already in the 1960s, the Acosta-Rubio Organization had begun to obtain excellent results with Mercedes Revenga as first runner-up at the Miss Beauty Form 1964 contest and later on reaching the top 15 at Miss Universe 1964. The choice of Mariela Pérez and Peggy Kopp as first and third runners-up at Miss Universe 1967 and Miss Universe 1968, respectively. Adriana López with the Miss Planet Resort 1967 won, Judith Castillo, being first runner-up at Miss Universe 1976, and Zully Guilarte winning the 1968 Miss Tourism of Central America and the Caribbean pageant. Maritza Sayalero won Miss Universe 1979, being the first edition of Miss Universe to be televised in color in Venezuela. With her win, began what is considered the &#x27;Golden age of Miss Venezuela&#x27;.

Since 1972, the Cisneros Organization acquired the rights to start producing and broadcasting the beauty contest on its channel, Venevisión. María Antonieta Cámpoli, Miss Venezuela 1972 at Miss Universe 1972 was second runner-up, and later at Miss Intercontinental 1974, María Emilia de los Ríos of Bolívar state.

=== Miss Venezuela Organization (1981 -) ===
In 1981, Irene Sáez won Miss Universe 1981, Pilín León won Miss World 1981, in addition to the death of Coll. Finally, in 1982, the Cisneros Group was placed at the helm of the beauty contest and the &quot;Miss Venezuela Organization&quot; was officially structured. After this, in February 1982, Cisneros and Acosta-Rubio appointed Osmel Sousa (a long time-worker at the empress) as Coll&#x27;s successor, taking the charge of President. Besides, Joaquín Riviera, María Kallay and Mery Cortez, were appointed as official producer, coordinator and choreographer of the event, respectively.

Starting in 1984, the crowns used in the organization&#x27;s pageants were made by jewelry designer, George Wittels. Until July 2018, Wittels was in charge of making the goldsmith pieces for the contest. George was succeeded by Mila Toledo, Miss Federal District in 1980.

In 1996, the beauty pageant launched its website, missvenezuela.com. Also, in the same year, the Mister Venezuela competition was founded, as well as, Miss Venezuela Mundo in 2000. In both cases, at the request of the Miss World Organization

In 2009, Venezuela entered the Guinness World Records for being the first and so far only representation in Miss Universe to be crowned by another winner from the same nation.

In 2010, the pageant acquired the Miss Earth franchise, which it maintained until 2015, obtaining Alyz Henrich a second crown for this contest as Miss Earth 2013.

Joaquín Riviera, Miss Venezuela executive producer, would be in charge of the event until his death in 2012. After María Kallay&#x27;s death in 2013, the production of the event was realized by Peggy Navarro, Ricardo Di Salvatore, Vicente Alvarado and Erick Simonato, who were part of the original production team along with Riviera as General Producer. In 2015, Peggy left office, leaving three managers, who to date are still part of the Miss Venezuela Organization.

In 2016, Mery Cortez, announced her departure from the contest and from Venevisión network, after almost 45 years as the choreographic producer of the contest.

On 6 February 2018, Osmel Sousa, announced his retirement as President of the Miss Venezuela Organization, after being in charge of the contest for more than 40 years, leaving the presidency vacant.

On 17 April 2018, the organization announced that the contest would it be run by an executive committee, not a president. The next day, the committee members were announced: Gabriela Isler, Miss Universe 2013, Jacqueline Aguilera, Miss World 1995 and Nina Sicilia, Miss International 1985.

== Contestant selection ==
=== List of state titles ===
There is an unofficial formula to determine the states and regions represented in Venezuela. The base number of contestants over the last decade has been 26–28, which can be increased or decreased by the contest management.

==== Official states (23) ====
  * Denotes that state has a preliminary pageant – which may or may not still be held – as of 2005 only Táchira, Zulia-Falcón, Lara, Aragua and Sucre held preliminaries.

==== Official regions (3) ====

*Costa Oriental (Eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo)
*Distrito Capital (Capital District)
*Federal Dependencies (&quot;Federal Dependencies&quot; Venezuelan islands)

Together, these 26 regions form the &quot;base&quot; of the Miss Venezuela contest. However, at times other regions and territories have been represented. If there are 27 sashes, the 27th candidate is Miss Peninsula Goajira. If there are 28 sashes, either Canaima (a national park in Bolivar state) or Paraguaná Peninsula (a region of Falcon state) is represented. In 2003, additional titles of Araya Peninsula (a region of Sucre State) and Roraima (a national park in Bolivar State) were created to bring the pageant to its highest ever number of contestants: 32. Surprisingly, in 2008 Península de Araya was used again, and there was no Miss Península Goajira or Miss Costa Oriental that year. In the mid-1990s, the districts of Municipio Libertador and Municipio San Francisco were also represented, the last one only in 1997 and 1998. Also, only in 2003, Guayana Esequiba (part of Guyana that historically Venezuela claims as its own) was represented. Vargas State, the most recent modification to Venezuela&#x27;s map (1999) was always present in the pageant, but with other names: Departamento Vargas (until 1986), Municipio Vargas (1987 to 1997), Territorio Federal Vargas (1998), and Vargas State since 1999. In 2009, only 20 delegates competed for the crown, the same number that competed on the final night in 2003, so some &quot;traditional&quot; states didn&#x27;t have a representative.

=== Winners by state/region ===

== Main pageant ==

=== Training ===

There are Miss Venezuela schools and &quot;beauty factories&quot; in which girls as young as 5 years old are trained to be the next potential Miss Venezuela. At both the schools and factories the young girls and women are taught how to walk properly, given beauty tips, and given lessons in proper etiquette.

Once a candidate is shortlisted for the pageant, she begins an intensive training program which can last for six months. She receives coaching in speech, physical fitness, make-up, modelling, and all the other skills required for the competition. Plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry are optional, and some delegates elect to use padding. As the Miss Venezuela broadcast lasts up to four hours long, with countless musical numbers and dances, rehearsals require weeks of preparation. Contestants also participate in official photo-shoots and also fittings by fashion designers.

The evening gowns worn by candidates are a major source of politicking by Venezuela&#x27;s domestic fashion houses, with top designers such as Mayela Camacho, Ángel Sanchez, Durant &amp; Diego, Jose María Almeida, and Gionni Straccia selecting candidates that they will dress for the final night, while other, newer designers compete to present designs for the pageant. As a general rule the evening gowns are always custom-designed for each of the candidates on the final night, and always by a Venezuelan designer. By tradition, Nidal Nouaihed dresses the representatives of his home state of Zulia (Miss Costa Oriental, Miss Peninsula Goajira, Miss Zulia); Ángel Sanchez designs the gown for Miss Trujillo; Jose María Almeida designs the dress for Miss Mérida and the national costume for Miss Venezuela to Miss Universe. In 1999, 26 different designers took part in the evening gown competition, one candidate for each one. Also, in 2006, for the first time ever, the designers appeared on stage with the delegates, showing their fabulous creations. For the first time, in Miss Venezuela 2008, a &quot;best evening gown&quot; prize was given to a designer; the winner was Gionni Straccia for Miss Monagas&#x27; dress. He also made the gown for Dayana Mendoza in the Miss Universe finals.

The winners chosen to represent Venezuela in the major pageants undergo continuous preparation before they compete internationally. These efforts are funded by corporate sponsors like Pepsi-Cola, Palmolive, Colgate, Ebel and Lux who were attracted to the pageant by its high ratings.

=== Participation in international pageants ===

As of 2025, Venezuela has a total of 24 wins at Big Four international beauty pageants, the most by any country in the world, and consisting of seven Miss Universe titles, six Miss World titles, nine Miss International titles, and two Miss Earth titles.

Miss Venezuela reached the semifinals of Miss Universe each year from 1983 to 2003, and reached the question-and-answer round consistently from 1991 to 2003 (winning in 1986 and 1996), constituting the longest streak of Miss Universe finalists by any country. This streak was ended in 2004, when Ana Karina Áñez was not included in the semifinals at Miss Universe 2004. Venezuela has also held Miss Universe and Miss World titles simultaneously in 1981 (Irene Saez and Pilin Leon), and Miss Universe and Miss Earth titles simultaneously in 2013 (Gabriela Isler and Alyz Henrich). Henrich&#x27;s Miss Earth victory made Venezuela the only country in the world to have won each of the Big Four pageants multiple times. Venezuela also holds the distinction of being the first, and so far only, country to win back-to-back Miss Universe titles when Dayana Mendoza, outgoing Miss Universe 2008, crowned Stefania Fernandez as Miss Universe 2009.

=== Success in other fields ===

Competing in the pageant can get a contestant noticed and launched on a successful television or print career. At least a dozen well-sought models come out of the pageant. Virtually all of Venezuela&#x27;s female top models and television personalities are alumni of the pageant, including Maite Delgado (who competed in 1986 against future Miss Universe Bárbara Palacios and became the primary annual emcee of Miss Venezuela&#x27;s live shows in recent decades), and Dominika van Santen (Top Model of the World 2005). In fact, only Gaby Espino and several other entertainment figures stand out as never having competed in the pageant. Many of today&#x27;s top young models, such as Onelises Brochero and Wendy Medina, have repeatedly been rejected by Miss Venezuela; on the other hand, Goizeder Azua and Desiree Pallotta, who have variously been considered the top domestic supermodels in the country, joined the pageant after establishing their careers.

Nowadays, familiar faces on Spanish TV networks around the world, from Venezuela, include Ruddy Rodríguez, Catherine Fulop, Carolina Perpetuo, Norkys Batista, Daniela Kosán, Viviana Gibelli, Marjorie de Sousa, Chiquinquirá Delgado, Alicia Machado and Natalia Streignard. Two of the Latin world&#x27;s best known people, supermodel Patricia Velásquez and singer/actress María Conchita Alonso, also participated, in 1989 and 1975, respectively.

Miss Universe 1981, Irene Sáez, became mayor of Chacao (Caracas), governor of Nueva Esparta State, and then a candidate in the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election. &quot;The Times&quot; of London ranked her 13th in its list of the 100 most powerful women in the world.

Alexandra Braun, Miss Earth 2005 became the most decorated international actress from Venezuela with the most acting awards when she won four international best actress awards in various film festivals all over the world for her portrayal of the lead role in the movie, &quot;Uma&quot; at the London Film Festival, Monaco International Film Festival, the Milan International Film Festival and the Georgia Latino Film Festival in Atlanta; the film also won recognition in the &quot;Film of the World&quot; category at the International Film Festival of India and won best foreign film at the Burbank International Film Festival in the United States.

=== Miss Venezuela and other countries ===

Some delegates in the pageant went on to win other national pageants. Natascha Börger became the first Venezuelan to switch countries, when she won the Miss Germany title in 2002 after placing 14th at Miss Venezuela 2000. She went on to place in the Top 10 at Miss Universe 2002 in Puerto Rico while Cynthia Lander, Miss Venezuela 2001, placed fifth in the same competition. Miss Trujillo 2005 Angelika Hernandez Dorendorf also placed fourth at Miss Germany 2007 and cancelled her participation at the Miss Intercontinental of that same year in order to continue her master&#x27;s degree. In 2006, Francys Sudnicka, who placed in the Top 10 representing Trujillo in Miss Venezuela 2003, won the Miss Poland Universe title. She represented Poland at Miss Universe 2006, and later represented Poland in Miss Earth 2006, taking a place in the Top 8. The following Venezuelans who have won the Miss Italia nel Mondo (Miss World Italy) pageant placed in the final five of Miss Venezuela: Barbara Clara (Miss Amazonas 2004), Valentina Patruno (Miss Miranda 2003) and Silvana Santaella (Miss Península de Paraguaná 2003). Patruno, though born Venezuelan, represented the United States.

In the past, other countries have sent their titleholders to be trained by Osmel Sousa and the Miss Venezuela Organization. In 1999, Miriam Quiambao of the Philippines trained in Venezuela before competing at Miss Universe 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago and eventually placing second to Botswana, while Carolina Indriago, Miss Venezuela 1998, appeared in the Top 5. The Miss Venezuela Organization, however, ended its policy allowing training of foreign candidates after Amelia Vega of the Dominican Republic received training from them before eventually winning Miss Universe 2003 in Panama, while Mariangel Ruiz, Miss Venezuela 2002, placed second behind her.

In recent years the pageant organization has begun to &quot;import&quot; expatriates who have been working as international models. Miami has produced Valentina Patruno (Miss World Venezuela 2003), Andrea Gómez (Miss International Venezuela 2004), Mónica Spear (Miss Venezuela 2004 and 4th runner-up at Miss Universe 2005), Ileana Jiménez (Miss Portuguesa 2005), and María Alessandra Villegas (Miss Península de Paraguaná 2008).

=== Order of succession ===
There has been considerable controversy in a number of major national pageants as to how to direct their contestants to Miss Universe, Miss World, and the other international contests. The reason for this issue is the dispute between the international pageants, who generally desire that the winner of a national contest be sent. Although many nations such as Italy and Germany have completely separate pageants for Miss Universe and Miss World, in the case of Miss Venezuela the national pageant organization must field candidates to almost all of the major world contests.

Between 2000 and 2002, the Miss Venezuela pageant was split into two contests: the Miss World Venezuela pageant, to elect the representative to Miss World, from which a reduced group of contestants would go on to compete in Miss Venezuela to go to the Miss Universe contest. In 2002, the organization merged the Miss World Venezuela contest with the Gala de Belleza, making the final &quot;state cut&quot; before the election of the Miss World representative. The two pageants were rejoined in 2003. Using the most prominent format used in Miss Venezuela&#x27;s entire run, the winners of the Miss Venezuela title (who goes to Miss Universe) and Miss World Venezuela are equal in rank. Nevertheless, the representative to Miss Universe is still announced last, and she is still considered the holder of the one single Miss Venezuela title. Nowadays, the final five finalists are announced during the telecast, followed by the elimination of the second and first runners-up, then Miss Venezuela to Miss International, Miss Venezuela to Miss World, and Miss Venezuela to Miss Universe. Since 2010, yet another new system has been introduced, with the fifth-place finisher as the 1st. runner-up, fourth place being designated as a &quot;representative&quot; to Miss Earth, the third place as a &quot;representative&quot; to Miss International and two &#x27;equal&#x27; crowned winners—Miss Venezuela World and Miss Venezuela Universe.

While this system is similar to that of Mexico and India, in Mexico the first runner-up is known as the &quot;substitute&quot; and in the order of succession automatically fills into any title above her that is emptied. For example, if &quot;Nuestra Belleza Mexico Mundo&quot; (Miss Mexico to Miss World) is unable to fulfill her duties, the first runner-up assumes her title. While the Miss Universe representative is similarly considered the &quot;greater of the two equals&quot;, if her position is vacated, the first runner-up ascends to her crown, instead of Miss Mexico-World becoming Miss Mexico-Universe and the first runner-up going to Miss World. In India, however, the succession does follow the other option: the top three titles go Earth-&gt;Universe-&gt;World in rising order of importance (although they are also emphasized as &quot;equals&quot;).

In Venezuela, neither policy of succession is explicitly laid down. Osmel Sousa made the final decisions as to who is appointed when a vacancy arises; &quot;i.e.&quot; in 2003, there were significant rumors that Mariangel Ruiz might be replaced by Amara Barroeta, the first runner-up, to Miss Universe (and not Goizeder Azua, who was Miss World Venezuela). In fact, in 2003, the Miss International Pageant was concurrent with Miss Venezuela, meaning that it would be impossible to send a &quot;fresh&quot; contestant, and Osmel actually opted not to send Amara, who should have gone (as the first runner-up then was almost always automatically titled Miss Venezuela International) and instead replaced her with Goizeder Azua, who won Miss International 2003. Due to scheduling conflicts between Miss International and Miss Venezuela, a similar situation occurred in 2002 when Cynthia Lander, Miss Venezuela (Universe), gave up her crown to the next Miss Venezuela and immediately boarded a flight for Japan to participate in Miss International. The reasoning was that her first runner-up had already participated the year before, and it would have been ridiculous to crown a Miss Venezuela (International) and immediately send her on a plane to her contest with no specific preparation whatsoever. Incidentally in 2006 the Miss World pageant shifted its pageant date from its usual November–December timeframe to September when the organization announced Poland as the competition venue. Due to the change in dates; it resulted to a timing conflict with the Miss Venezuela pageant. The Miss Venezuela organization decided to hold a snap pageant called &quot;Miss Venezuela Mundo&quot; to elect a representative for Miss World 2006. The said competition was composed of former Miss Venezuela contestants from previous editions. At the end of the night Federica Guzman who represented the state of Miranda in 2001 was the winner. Thus, all four winners, Miss Earth Venezuela, Miss Venezuela International, Miss Venezuela World and Miss Venezuela Universe now compete in the year after their coronation.

Ironically, the only time in the &quot;modern&quot; pageant that the famous &quot;if the winner should not fulfill her duties, the first runner-up will take over&quot; statement was made for Miss Venezuela was in 1999. The decision was made to send whoever won to Miss World first, and then to Miss Universe if she did not win. This policy was adopted after the consecutive eliminations of Christina Dieckmann and Veronica Schneider in 1997 and 1998, both of whom were considered amongst the strongest Miss World Venezuelas in history and whose eliminations were seen by the organization as a signal that it needed to send its winner to Miss World. Therefore, in 1999, there were no Miss World Venezuela or Miss Venezuela International titles, only an official Miss Venezuela, who was Martina Thorogood. Her first runner-up, Norkys Batista, was told that she would become Miss Venezuela to Miss Universe only if Martina won the Miss World crown outright. Martina came in second at Miss World and she was expected continue on to Miss Universe 2000 the next year. However, due to a number of major controversies, she was barred from Miss Universe 2000 on the grounds that as the first runner-up to Miss World, Osmel also declared that Miss Universe demanded a winner from Venezuela, thereby barring Norkys Batista from succeeding to the title. The only option for Norkys to go was for Martina to renounce the Miss Venezuela title, which neither she or the organization was willing to do. Therefore, a new emergency (and temporary) pageant was held, called Miss Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which was conducted among ten former contestants (some semi-finalists and other non-finalists) from the previous five years. The winner, Claudia Moreno, had placed as seventh in the semi-finals behind Martina and Norkys in Miss Venezuela 1999, and she ended up performing excellently and becoming first runner-up to Miss Universe 2000. In years to come, 2002&#x27;s first runner-up Amara Barroeta would join Norkys Batista as one of several runners-ups to be &quot;denied&quot; the chance to compete at a &quot;big three&quot; pageant.

In the US and many other countries, an occasion when the order of succession comes into play is when the reigning titleholder wins her international contest, &quot;e.g.&quot; in 1997 when Brook Mahealani Lee became Miss Universe and her first runner-up Brandi Sherwood became Miss USA. However, Venezuela does not have this official provision, even when the two &quot;equal&quot; winners both win Miss Universe and Miss World. In 1981, Miriam Quintana was considered somewhat unofficially as the serving Miss Venezuela, because both Irene Saez and Pilin Leon had won their respective pageants. However, in 1995–1996, when Alicia Machado took the Miss Universe title and Jacqueline Aguilera the Miss World crown, no new &quot;Miss Venezuela&quot; was appointed to hold the crown while they reigned internationally, though some newspapers said that Carla Steinkopf, Miss International Venezuela 1995, would give the crown to the 1996 winner. In general, all the times Venezuela has won the Miss Universe Pageant, it&#x27;s Miss Universe herself who returns to crown the new Miss Venezuela, not Miss World Venezuela from the previous year or another finalist. Since 2013, the Miss World delegate is no longer crowned at the Miss Venezuela final but is crowned in a separate Miss Venezuela World pageant, and competes in the same year of her coronation. In 2014, Maira Alexandra Rodriguez was crowned as Miss Earth Venezuela to compete in the 2015 edition, but due to the destitution of her predecessor, Stephanie de Zorzi, she was sent to Miss Earth 2014, in which she ended as Miss Water (2nd runner-up).

From 2015 onwards, Miss Earth Venezuela will compete in the same year of her coronation. In 2017, the announcing was made as it was years before: Top 5 consisting of 2nd and 1st runners-up, then Miss Venezuela International, Miss World Venezuela and Miss Venezuela Universe, all three competing in 2018. This avoids the rumors of major pageants not allowing contestants to participate if they weren&#x27;t in their current reign year. However, in 2018, Osmel&#x27;s resignation coincided with the same year Miss Venezuela sent their winner, Isabella Rodríguez, to Miss World. As a result, since 2019, the organization switched to a separate Miss World Venezuela national pageant while retaining the Miss Universe and Miss International national titles under the main Miss Venezuela pageant for all succeeding candidates.

=== Controversies ===
==== Objectification ====
Esther Pineda, a Venezuelan women&#x27;s studies expert, stated that the popularity of Miss Venezuela and other pageants in Venezuela reveals how the country is &quot;deeply sexist&quot;. Despite controversies facing Miss Venezuela, the Me Too movement has not carried any significance in Venezuela. According to Pineda, in Venezuela &quot;[p]hysical beauty is seen as a value. ... And it&#x27;s given more importance than any other attribute&quot;.

==== Sexual exploitation ====
Miss Venezuela contestants are often subject to prostitution and sexual exploitation. Young contestants are passed to powerful individuals in Venezuelan society for sexual favors. In a poverty-filled country, vulnerable women turn to wealthy individuals for funds. With participation often costing tens of thousands of United States dollars, these participants perform sexual favors for their wardrobe, cosmetic surgery, photo shoots and for sponsorships in order to &quot;create the illusion of &#x27;perfect&#x27; beauty&quot; that is held in esteem in Venezuelan culture. Some contestants allegedly involved in such acts include Miss Venezuela 1989 participant Patricia Velásquez and Miss Venezuela 2006 runner-up Claudia Suárez.

The organization conducted a selection process which attended by several former beauty queens and runners up to qualify for participation. Mariángela Bonanni who competed in the Miss Venezuela 2009 (placed as first runner up) representing the state of Táchira, was chosen by the organization to participate in Miss Earth 2010.

<text>Tsang Tsou-choi (), commonly referred to as the &quot;Emperor of Kowloon&quot; () (12 November 1921 – 15 July 2007) was a Hong Kong citizen known for his distinctive calligraphy graffiti.

== Early years ==
Tsang was born in Liantang Village (), Koyiu (Gaoyao), Shiuhing (Zhaoqing), Kwangtung (Guangdong), Republic of China. He travelled to Hong Kong at the age of 16 as a worker, poor and barely literate. He began to mark the streets of Hong Kong with his distinctive graffiti at the age of 35. He claimed that he had studied his ancestral tree and discovered that most of the land of Kowloon belonged to his ancestors. He said that Kowloon belonged to his grandfather. There are no records to back up Tsang&#x27;s claim.

== His artwork ==
He was arrested for his graffiti several times; however, the police usually just gave him a warning or a small fine. His family disowned him, saying he was mentally unbalanced and a public nuisance and his wife had grown tired of his obsession and left him.

Although his graffiti was repeatedly painted over, he often returned to re-apply his messages as soon as the paint dried. At the height of his graffiti career, his obsessive marking of territory made his graffiti an ever-present aspect of the streets of Hong Kong. The graffiti has been spotted at many places on the streets of Hong Kong, ranging from lampposts, utility boxes, pillars, pavements, street furniture, and building walls, to an occasional car. The contents of his calligraphic graffiti usually include his name, his title (Emperor or King of Kowloon, Hong Kong, or China), his family tree (a variable list of about 20 individuals), the names of illustrious emperors, and the exclamation, &quot;Down with the Queen of England!&quot; His complaints about the supposed misappropriation of his land were not always so formulaic, however. He occasionally demanded that the government pay him land taxes.

A Hong Kong magazine named him one of the city&#x27;s ten least influential people. However, this supposed lack of influence does not extend to the art world. His calligraphy has inspired many fashion designers, art directors, interior decorators, and CD cover artists. His style has also informed the work of traditional artists, such as Oscar Ho. He appeared in a commercial for Swipe cleaner, in which he cleans away his permanent ink graffiti, proclaiming the product&#x27;s effectiveness to Hong Kong consumers.

During his last years, he lived in a retirement home, and no longer wrote on walls. However, his poor health did not entirely halt his calligraphic efforts. He continued his work on paper, household linens, and other mundane items. He also told visitors that he should have been elected chief executive of Hong Kong, instead of Donald Tsang, that &quot;impostor&quot;.

He received international recognition for his work. Photographs of his work have toured in shows, such as &quot;Power of the Word&quot;, which began its US tour at Grinnell College&#x27;s Faulconer Gallery on 6 October 2000. In 2000, he appeared in Clarence Fok&#x27;s film &quot;Queen of Kowloon&quot; and in 2001, he appeared in Fruit Chan&#x27;s film &quot;Hollywood Hong Kong&quot;. In 2003, he was included in the Venice Biennale. His first major commercial recognition came when Sotheby&#x27;s auctioned a board, painted by Tsang, for HK$55,000 (US$7,050) on 31 October 2004.

He died on 15 July 2007 following a heart attack in Hong Kong. He was 85. Art critic Lau Kin-wai said Tsang spent his final days at an elderly home surrounded by family members. He also said that Tsang&#x27;s last wish was for another exhibition of his work.

In 2011, Hong Kong curator Joel Chung Yin-chai curated the exhibition &quot;Memories of King Kowloon&quot; at Artistree, Taikoo Place. The exhibition exhibited many of Tsang&#x27;s handwritten works and some of his belongings. Some of his work has been acquired by the M+ museum in West Kowloon.

== Legacy ==
When news of his death became known, many people went to take pictures of his work, especially the one in Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier (because of the convenience of the location), which was later sprayed with a clear protective layer. Many worried that the government would &#x27;clean up&#x27; his remaining public artwork. The Hong Kong authorities promised this would not happen and undertook to analyse ways of preserving his works. However, in 2009 there were protests and questions in Legco regarding the apparent failure of the government to prevent the removal and overpainting of much of his legacy. The Home Affairs Bureau maintained the government&#x27;s commitment to protecting Tsang&#x27;s works &quot;depending on the actual situation and feasibility&quot;.

On 23 April 2021, one of the king&#x27;s piece on Kwun Tong bridge, that was getting renovated after being vandalized, was vandalized again in the same fashion, allegedly by pro-Beijing supporters.

Tsang has been featured significantly in Hong Kong culture, including the 1993 Beyond song &quot;Desting is Your Home&quot; (), as well as the &quot;King of Kowloon&quot; () by DJ Lorry.

Tsang&#x27;s contribution to Hong Kong culture is documented in Dr Helena Wu&#x27;s book &quot;The Hangover after the Handover: Places, Things and Cultural Icons in Hong Kong&quot;, which dedicates an entire chapter to him.

<doc id="1122434" wikidata="Q7850941" url="?curid=1122434" title="Tubule">
<text>In biology, a tubule is a general term referring to small tube or similar type of structure. Specifically, tubule can refer to:
* a small tube or fistular structure
* a minute tube lined with glandular epithelium
* any hollow cylindrical body structure
* a minute canal found in various structures or organs of the body
* a slender elongated anatomical channel
* a minute tube, especially as an anatomical structure.

==Examples of tubules==
* Collecting tubules: terminal channels of the nephrons
* Cuvierian tubules: clusters of sticky tubules located at the base of the respiratory tree, which may be discharged by some sea cucumbers (holothurians) when mechanically stimulated (i.e. being threatened by a predator)
* Dentinal tubules or dental canaliculi: minute channels in the dentine of a tooth that extend from the pulp cavity to the cementum or the enamel
* Distal convoluted tubule: the convoluted portion of the vertebrate nephron that lies between the loop of Henle and the nonsecretory part of the nephron and that is concerned especially with the concentration of urine
* Galactophorous tubule or lactiferous ducts: small channels for the passage of milk from the secreting cells in the mammary gland to the nipple
* Loop of Henle: the long U-shaped part of the renal tubule, extending through the medulla from the end of the proximal convoluted tubule. It begins with a descending limb (comprising the proximal straight tubule and the thin tubule ), followed by the ascending limb (the distal straight tubule ), and ending at the distal convoluted tubule
* Malpighian tubule: any of the excretory organs in insects that lie in the abdominal body cavity and empty into the junction between the midgut and hindgut
* Mesonephric tubule: tubules comprising the mesonephros or temporary kidney of amniotes
* Metanephric tubule: tubules comprising the permanent kidney of amniotes
* Microtubule: a microscopically small tubule
* Proximal convoluted tubule: the portion of the nephron immediately after the glomerulus
* Renal tubule: the minute canals made up of basement membrane and lined with epithelium, composing the substance of the kidney and secreting, reabsorbing, collecting and conducting the urine. Include proximal convoluted, the nephron loop (containing the proximal straight tubule, descending and ascending thin, and the distal straight tubules) and the distal convoluted tubules
* Seminiferous tubules: any of the numerous long convoluted tubules in the testis which are the sites where spermatozoa mature
* T tubule: transverse intracellular tubules invaginating from the cell membrane and surrounding the myofibrils of the T system of skeletal and cardiac muscle, serving as a pathway for the spread of electrical excitation within a muscle cell
* Trachea: tubules forming the respiratory system of most insects and many arachnids
* Uriniferous tubules: any of the small tubules that are the excretory units of the vertebrate kidney
* Uveoscleral pathway: a tubule that drains excess aqueous humor
* Vasa efferentia: convoluted tubules that lead from the rete testis to the vas deferens and form the head of the epididymis
* Vesicular-tubular clusters between the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum which assist in transport.

<text>USS &quot;Stansbury&quot; (DD–180) was a in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Namesake==
John Stansbury was born on 28 March 1788 in Baltimore, Maryland. He served under Stephen Decatur as a midshipman on the during the capture of the British ship, &quot;Macedonian&quot;. Lieutenant Stansbury was killed during the Battle of Lake Champlain on 11 September 1814.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Stansbury&quot; was laid down on 9 December 1918 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Union Iron Works at San Francisco, launched on 16 May 1919, sponsored by Miss Mary Eleanor Trevorrow, and commissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 8 January 1920.

==Service history==
&quot;Stansbury&quot; served with the Pacific Fleet for over two years during which time she received the designation DD-180. On 27 May 1922, she was decommissioned and berthed at San Diego. She remained inactive for more than 12 years, but the onset of World War II in September 1939 necessitated her reactivation along with that of many of her sister ships. Accordingly, &quot;Stansbury&quot; was recommissioned at San Diego on 29 August 1940. From there, she moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard to begin her conversion to a high-speed minesweeper. In October, she proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where the conversion was completed. On 19 November, she was redesignated a destroyer minesweeper, DMS-8.

===World War II===
&quot;Stansbury&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet from October 1940 to December 1943. She spent her first year in the Atlantic in minesweeping exercises, in coastwise escort duties, and in conducting maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. On 30 June 1942, while escorting the from Norfolk to Bermuda, she attacked a German U-boat with depth charges. A rough sea and rescue operations for survivors of the torpedoed merchantmen handicapped her during the unsuccessful attack. However, her humanitarian effort proved successful, and on 1 July, she pulled into Bermuda with 390 survivors.

The destroyer minesweeper set out from Norfolk on 24 October 1942 to join Task Force (TF) 34, the North Africa invasion force. &quot;Stansbury&quot; was assigned to Mine Squadron (MinRon) 7 of the Center Attack Group for the landings. The group&#x27;s assault area was at Fedala just up the coast from Casablanca. The ships arrived off the objective area on 7 November. &quot;Stansbury&quot; and the other minesweepers made an exploratory sweep of the approaches and then she joined the screen in patrolling the transport area. On 15 November, was torpedoed, but thanks to the efforts of &quot;Stansbury&quot;, , and she remained afloat throughout the night and was beached at Casablanca the following morning. The destroyer minesweeper returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 December 1942. For the next year, she plied the eastern coastal waters of the United States and the North Atlantic as far east as Iceland.

On 4 December 1943, &quot;Stansbury&quot; transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet. She conducted minesweeping exercises off the coast of California for about a month; then stood out of San Diego on 13 January 1944 and headed west with TF 53. The task force reached Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 22 January and sailed for the Marshalls the following day. &quot;Stansbury&quot; operated in the anti-submarine screen both during the voyage to Kwajalein and during the assault itself. She remained in the vicinity from 1 to 7 February, and then joined an amphibious group in returning to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands. On 13 February, she sailed to Nouméa, New Caledonia, arriving on the 20th. For almost four months, &quot;Stansbury&quot; made the South Pacific circuit, screening numerous amphibious and logistics groups. She visited the Solomons and New Hebrides groups, New Britain, and escorted part of the Admiralty Islands assault force to its objective in mid-April. She returned to the central Pacific, in May, at Eniwetok.

On 10 June, she and nine other destroyer minesweepers departed Eniwetok and, three days later, rendezvoused off Saipan with TF 58, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force. The minesweepers swept off the west coast of the island while TF 58 covered them. After about five hours of clearing mines, they retired and joined an advance bombardment group from TF 53. &quot;Stansbury&quot; helped screen the big warships from enemy submarines until the arrival of the initial invasion forces on 15 June, then she joined in a bombardment of Guam. Returning to the vicinity of Saipan and Tinian, she provided fire support for the troops ashore until 26 June when she headed back to Eniwetok. On 21 July, after almost four weeks of absence, she returned to the Marianas with TF 53 to support the recapture of Guam. For a week, she screened the task force from submarines and performed picket patrol for the amphibious units.

On 28 July, she returned to Eniwetok as part of the escort for a transport group. On 7 August, the destroyer minesweeper got underway from Eniwetok for San Francisco, via Pearl Harbor. She reached her destination on 26 August and entered the yard of the General Engineering &amp; Dry Dock Co. Her overhaul was completed on 17 January 1945, and &quot;Stansbury&quot; sailed to San Diego, arriving the following day. There, she reported for duty with the San Diego Shakedown Group.

For the remainder of the war, she served as a training ship for the Fleet Operational Training Command, Pacific Fleet. Her designation was changed from DMS-8 to AG-107 on 5 June 1945. In September 1945, &quot;Stansbury&quot; transited the Panama Canal again and headed for Norfolk, Virginia. She was decommissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 December 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 January 1946. Her hulk was sold to Luria Bros. Co. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 26 October, and she was scrapped on 25 January 1947.

==Awards==
&quot;Stansbury&quot; was awarded three battle stars during World War II.

As of 2004, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<doc id="1122440" wikidata="Q791564" url="?curid=1122440" title="Bayou Country (album)">
<text>Bayou Country is the second studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released by Fantasy Records on January 15, 1969, and was the first of three albums CCR released in that year. &quot;Bayou Country&quot; reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and produced the band&#x27;s first No. 2 hit single, &quot;Proud Mary&quot;.

==Background==
After ten years of struggling as the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs, singer/guitarist John Fogerty, his brother guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford scored a No. 11 hit single with &quot;Susie Q&quot; in June 1968 under the name Creedence Clearwater Revival. Their self-titled album peaked at No. 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. 

Despite their new-found success, however, seeds of discontent among the four members had already been planted due to John Fogerty assuming control of the band at just about every level. &quot;There was a point at which we had done the first album. Everybody had listened to my advice. I don&#x27;t think anybody thought too much about it,&quot; Fogerty recalled to Michael Goldberg of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1993. &quot;But in making the second album, &quot;Bayou Country&quot;, we had a real confrontation. Everybody wanted to sing, write, make up their own arrangements, whatever, right? This was after ten years of struggling. Now we had the spotlight. Andy Warhol&#x27;s fifteen minutes of fame. &#x27;Susie Q&#x27; was as big as we&#x27;d ever seen. Of course, it really wasn&#x27;t that big...I didn&#x27;t want to go back to the carwash.&quot; 

In 2007, the singer elaborated to Joshua Klein of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;I determined, we&#x27;re on the tiniest record label in the world, there&#x27;s no money behind us, we don&#x27;t have a manager, there&#x27;s no publicist. We basically had none of the usual star-making machinery, so I said to myself I&#x27;m just going to have to do it with the music...Basically I wanted to do what the Beatles had done. I sensed that I just had to do it myself.&quot;

==Composition==
&quot;Bayou Country&quot; contains what is arguably John Fogerty&#x27;s most heralded composition, &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the singles chart. In a 1969 interview, Fogerty said that he wrote it in the two days after he was discharged from the National Guard. In the liner notes for the 2008 expanded reissue of &quot;Bayou Country&quot;, Joel Selvin explained that the riffs for &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, and &quot;Keep on Chooglin&#x27;&quot; were conceived by Fogerty at a concert in the Avalon Ballroom, and &quot;Proud Mary&quot; was arranged from parts of different songs, one of which was about a &quot;washerwoman named Mary&quot;. The line &quot;Left a good job in the city&quot; was written following Fogerty&#x27;s discharge from the National Guard, and the line &quot;rollin&#x27; on the river&quot; was from a movie by Will Rogers. In the Macintosh program &quot;Garage Band&quot;, Fogerty explained that he liked Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, and wanted to open a song with a similar intro, referring to the way &quot;Proud Mary&quot; opens with the repeated C chord to A chord. In 1998, Fogerty admitted to Harold Steinblatt of &quot;Guitar World&quot; that he knew the composition was &quot;my first really good song. I was 23 years old, I believe, and I&#x27;d been kind of playing at music for 10 years. But I recognized the importance of &#x27;Proud Mary&#x27; immediately.&quot; In the same interview, Fogerty stated that the guitar solo was &quot;me trying to be Steve Cropper,&quot; the guitarist from Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s. The song was acclaimed almost immediately, with Solomon Burke scoring a minor hit with it in 1969 and a radically rearranged version appearing on Ike and Tina Turner&#x27;s 1971 LP &quot;Workin&#x27; Together&quot;. Bob Dylan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in a 1969 interview that it was his favorite song of the year. In 2012, Fogerty recalled to &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s David Cavanagh that he was extremely focused at the time, honing his songwriting with a single-mindedness that led to a proficient string of hits:

The swampy album opener &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; was conceived in the same setting, with Fogerty explaining to Lynne Margolis of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; in 2013:

In 1970, Fogerty told &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Born on the Bayou&#x27; was vaguely like &#x27;Porterville,&#x27; about a mythical childhood and a heat-filled time, the Fourth of July. I put it in the swamp where, of course, I had never lived...&#x27;Chasing down a hoodoo.&#x27; Hoodoo is a magical, mystical, spiritual, non-defined apparition, like a ghost or a shadow, not necessarily evil, but certainly other-worldly. I was getting some of that imagery from Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters.&quot; In an interview with Jeb Wright on the &quot;Classic Rock Revisited&quot; website, Clifford cited &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; as his favorite Creedence song, stating, &quot;The favorite song that we ever did, for me, was &#x27;Born on the Bayou.&#x27; Still, when I hear that song I go, &#x27;That’s me playing on that.&#x27; It is a weird thing. It was greasy and we were right out of the clubs. That song had so much soul in it.&quot; Although not a concept album, Fogerty did acknowledge to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1993 that &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; &quot;is almost the Gordian knot or the key to what happened later. As I was writing it, it occurred to me that there was more power than just this one song. If there was a way to tie it all together on one album, kind of cross-fertilize, cross-relate the songs, you would have a much more interesting and maybe more powerful image. So that&#x27;s what happened. &#x27;Born on the Bayou&#x27; sort of relates to &#x27;Proud Mary.&#x27; It certainly relates to &#x27;Keep on Chooglin&#x27; and &#x27;Graveyard Train.&#x27;&quot;

Some of the other Creedence members have taken exception to the notion that Fogerty was the sole creative force in the band, with Doug Clifford telling Gary James of classicbands.com, &quot;We all jammed every day when we weren&#x27;t on the road and actually when we were on the road. We&#x27;d play acoustically at night. Three to four hours every night we would work the songs out or songs would come out of that song pool. The rest of us didn&#x27;t get any credit for anything that came out of it. That&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m not crying over spilled milk, but when you really look at how prolific John was in the 3½ years that we had our success and the major drought he&#x27;s had as a solo artist, I think it adds a little more credence...to what we contributed to the band.&quot; The atmosphere behind the scenes was indeed worsening; in a 2012 article with &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s Tom Pinnock, Fogerty recalled, &quot;We went into RCA in Hollywood, Studio A, to record &quot;Bayou Country&quot; in October. We had the music for “Proud Mary” recorded, and I knew what I wanted the backgrounds to sound like. I showed the other guys how to sing the backgrounds, having remembered what we&#x27;d sounded like on “Porterville”, which was very ragged, not melodious...And I heard our tape back, and I just went, “Nahhh, that’s not gonna work.” So we had a big fight over that...We literally coulda broke up right there.&quot;

In addition to the Fogerty originals, &quot;Bayou Country&quot; also features a version of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; with slightly changed lyrics; instead of the result of the gift of a diamond ring being, &quot;When she hugs me, her kissin&#x27; make me ting-a-ling-a-ling,&quot; John Fogerty sang, &quot;Would you pardon me a kissin&#x27; and a ting-a-ling-a-ling?&quot; &quot;Keep On Chooglin&#x27;&quot;, laced with sexual innuendo, would become a concert show-stopper for the band.

==Reception==

In an early review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; thought that the album suffered from a major fault of inconsistency. &quot;The good cuts are very good; but the bad ones just don&#x27;t make it,&quot; it said. The review was positive on the title track &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, but thought many of the other tracks lacked originality. Overall it considered the material in the album &quot;not always strong, but Creedence Clearwater Revival plays with enough gusto to overcome this problem.&quot; For its 40th-anniversary reissue in 2008, the album was given a score of 3.5 stars out of 5.

On AllMusic the album received 4.5 stars (out of 5), with Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating: &quot;Opening slowly with the dark, swampy &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, Bayou Country reveals an assured Creedence Clearwater Revival, a band that has found its voice between their first and second album. It&#x27;s not just that &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; announces that CCR has discovered its sound—it reveals the extent of John Fogerty&#x27;s myth-making.&quot;

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The album was first certified Gold by the RIAA on December 16, 1970, then double Platinum on December 13, 1990.

<doc id="1122454" wikidata="Q3377463" url="?curid=1122454" title="USS Hopewell (DD-181)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Hopewell&quot; (DD–181) was a in the United States Navy, entering service in 1919. After a brief active life, the ship was deactivated in 1922 and placed in reserve for 18 years before returning to service in 1940 during World War II. She was later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Bath&quot; (I17), as a , and then to the Royal Norwegian Navy as HNoMS &quot;Bath&quot;. &quot;Bath&quot; was torpedoed while escorting a trans-Atlantic convoy on 19 August 1941.

==Construction and career==

=== United States Navy service ===
Named for Pollard Hopewell, she was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, Virginia on 8 June 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Orote Hutcheson. The destroyer was commissioned on 22 March 1919 at Portsmouth, Virginia.

&quot;Hopewell&quot; sailed from Norfolk on 19 April 1919 to join the 3rd Destroyer Squadron in New England waters, and in May was on observation station off the Azores during the historic crossing of the Atlantic by Navy seaplanes. The destroyer returned to New York City on 8 June to complete her interrupted fitting out, and rejoined her squadron in August for firing tests. The winter of 1920 was spent on intensive training and target practice in Caribbean waters.

The ship returned to New England in early May, where she remained until September training reservists and engaging in division maneuvers. Arriving at Charleston, South Carolina on 22 September, &quot;Hopewell&quot; carried out similar operations out of the South Carolina port, returning to New York in May 1921 for reserve training. Sailing from Newport, Rhode Island on 10 October, the destroyer was placed in reserve at Charleston until 10 April, when she departed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. &quot;Hopewell&quot; decommissioned there on 17 July 1922.

She recommissioned on 17 June 1940 as the United States prepared for World War II, and after operating with the Neutrality Patrol off New England arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 18 September. She decommissioned on 23 September and was transferred to the UK as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.

=== Royal Navy service ===
Renamed HMS &quot;Bath&quot;, she crossed the Atlantic and arrived at Devenport naval base on 12 October 1940, and after a short refit, joined the 1st Minelaying Squadron based at the Kyle of Lochalsh. &quot;Bath&quot; was used to escort minesweeping operations by the squadron and for convoys. At the end of January 1941, &quot;Bath&quot; went into refit at Chatham Dockyard to better suit her for escort duties. The aft 4-inch and 3-inch guns were removed and replaced by a single 12-pounder (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun. Two sets of torpedo tubes were removed, while one mast was removed and the foremast shortened to reduce topweight.

=== Royal Norwegian Navy service ===
On 9 April 1941, following completion of the refit, &quot;Bath&quot; transferred to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. As HNoMS &quot;Bath&quot; she began operation as part of the &quot;Liverpool Escort Force&quot; as a member of the 5th Escort Group early in June, escorting convoys between the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, but had a very brief subsequent career, being sunk by the German submarine on 19 August 1941, while escorting Convoy OG 71 bound for Gibraltar. She was hit in the engine room on the starboard side by two torpedoes and broke in two, sinking in three minutes. As she sank two of her depth charges exploded killing some of the crew in the water. Of her 128 crew, only 42 were rescued by HMS &quot;Hydrangea&quot; and but two of those subsequently died aboard &quot;Hydrangea&quot;. The death toll was compounded by the fact that two depth charges exploded when the vessel went down.

<text>The 1970 South African Grand Prix, formally titled the Fourth AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Vierde AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami Circuit on 7 March 1970. It was race 1 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was also the 14th and last Formula One victory for triple world champion Jack Brabham, and at age 43, was the last driver to win a Formula One race over the age of 40 until Nigel Mansell at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix.

Two time World Champion and five time Monaco Grand Prix winner Graham Hill, driving a Lotus 49C for Rob Walker, made his return to racing after a life-threatening crash in the 1969 United States Grand Prix. Despite extensive knee surgery that left Hill with minimal mobility, he finished sixth. Hill rated this achievement as among his finest. After the race, he could not get out of the car by himself and had to be lifted out.

<text>Terra Linda High School (also known as TLHS and more commonly known as TL) is a public secondary school located in Terra Linda, San Rafael, California, United States. In 2006, it was named a California Distinguished School. The school is part of the San Rafael City Schools school district. The official school mascot is the Trojan.

Residents of the high school district may choose either Terra Linda High or San Rafael High School. The high school district includes San Rafael, Santa Venetia, Lucas Valley-Marinwood, and a portion of Larkspur.

In 2004, Terra Linda High School&#x27;s varsity football team was the NCS 2A Redwood Empire Football Champion. In 2018, the varsity football team won the MCAL title and won their first round NCS game against Pinole Valley High School.

Terra Linda Football dominated the MCAL under Coach Don Lucas from 1966 to 1980; winning ten league titles and the NCS 3A division in 1979 and 1980. The &#x27;79 team featured a veer offense and a stout 4-3 defense that allowed only 2 touchdowns all year. The 1980 Trojans did a repeat and won the NCS 3A Championship against El Molino on Quagmire Bailey Field in Santa Rosa.

<text>The 1970 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Jarama circuit on 19 April 1970. It was race 2 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

Prior to the race, the organisers of the Grand Prix sparked anger amongst the members of FOCA when they limited the number of starters to only sixteen. To add to the chaos, none of the laps set on Friday were counted towards qualifying. On the morning before the race, the matter seemed resolved and the organisers initially reversed their decision, and those who failed to qualify looked as if they would be allowed to start. The Commission Sportive Internationale then stepped in and forced the Spanish organisers to revert to the original limit of sixteen starters, and the cars that failed to qualify were wheeled off the grid.
The race was won by defending world champion Jackie Stewart, driving a March 701 car entered by a privateer Tyrrell team. This was the last win of a privately entered car in Formula One. American driver Mario Andretti took his first Formula One podium in third place. The race was marred by a serious accident involving Jackie Oliver and Jacky Ickx. Both their cars burst into flames, and Ickx was slightly burned after his race overalls became soaked in burning fuel. He recovered sufficiently to be able to compete in the next race, at Monaco. Bruce McLaren scored his last podium, points and race finish.

<text>The 1970 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Monaco on 10 May 1970. It was race 3 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Jochen Rindt scored the last victory for the famous Lotus 49.

This was Bruce McLaren&#x27;s final Formula One race - as he was killed 5 days before the next race at Belgium - and Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s first.

==Report==
There were no significant changes in the drivers&#x27; lineup for Monaco, and the only new driver was Ronnie Peterson, entering in a non-works March. The Lotus team decided to bring the old 49C chassis instead of the new 72, despite testing the new car in a non-championship race at Silverstone a couple of weeks earlier. In qualifying March swept the front row, with Jackie Stewart on pole (for the Tyrrell team) and Chris Amon alongside him. Third was Denny Hulme&#x27;s McLaren, and fourth the Brabham of Jack Brabham; behind them was the Ferrari of Jacky Ickx. The first Lotus driver was Jochen Rindt, qualifying in eighth place.

Despite heavy rain during the practice laps, the drivers raced in clear conditions and on a dry track. Stewart led the field with Amon, Brabham, Ickx and Jean-Pierre Beltoise behind him; Hulme got a poor start and was way down the order after the first corner. On the second lap, Beltoise passed Ickx, who retired on lap 12 with a driveshaft failure. On lap 22 Beltoise, now in fourth, retired with transmission problems; on the same lap Brabham passed Amon to take second place. Stewart remained the race leader until his car began misfiring on lap 27. After a long pit stop, Stewart returned to the race only to eventually retire. This left Brabham in the lead, with Amon, Hulme and Rindt following. The engine failed on Jackie Oliver&#x27;s BRM, who retired due to quickly falling oil pressure. At around the same time, Hulme developed problems with the gearing of his McLaren and so dropped back behind Rindt and Henri Pescarolo.

On lap 62 Amon&#x27;s suspension failed; he was forced to retire, leaving Rindt in second place nine seconds behind Brabham. Rindt increased his pace, able to close the gap to Brabham. On the final corner of the last lap, however, Brabham defended the inside line to prevent Rindt from passing. There was less traction on the dusty surface off the racing line, and Brabham locked the wheels under braking and the car skidded across the track towards the barriers. Rindt passed behind him and won the race. Brabham quickly reversed and finished the race in second position. Third was Pescarolo in a Matra, while the remaining points positions were rounded out by Hulme, Graham Hill (who worked his way up from the last spot on the grid) and Pedro Rodríguez.

March driver Chris Amon set the new lap record at this race, at a speed of 152 miles an hour. Race winner Pedro Rodríguez had set a 160 miles an hour lap in a sports car race the week before the Grand Prix. It was also Rodriguez&#x27;s last victory in Formula One, and BRM&#x27;s first victory since Jackie Stewart won the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix. This was the second Formula One win ever for a Mexican driver, and the last until the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix. The race also saw the debut of Ignazio Giunti, who finished fourth in a Ferrari.

This was the last Formula One race to be held on the original Spa circuit. It was also the last Formula One victory for Dunlop.

<text>The 1970 Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Zandvoort on June 21, 1970. It was race 5 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. This race was held the same day as the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final in Mexico City, Mexico, but that event took place later in the day from this Grand Prix.

The race was won by Lotus-Ford driver Jochen Rindt in his new monocoque-chassis Type 72, a radical wedge shape first used on the 1968 Indianapolis Lotus, with inboard braking and torsion bar suspension, it represented a major technical advance, giving the driver superior ride and vision in a better ventilated seat. Rindt had only raced the car twice before (but in a different spec) and had preferred his old Lotus 49 in the preceding Monaco and Belgian rounds of the World Championship. Three years earlier the 72&#x27;s predecessor; DFV-debutant Type 49 won in 1967 won first time out at exactly the same track with Jim Clark driving. Rindt racing the 72 without the complex anti-squat and anti-dive features, which the Austrian had never believed in, effortlessly dominated the practice and race putting little pressure on the car and not even having to use the maximum road width or line. The race also saw the debut of Clay Regazzoni with Ferrari, who finished fourth.

==Report==

Jacky Ickx led Jochen Rindt off the line. On lap 2, Rindt running on full tanks, with 50–55 gallons of petrol on board, put in his fastest lap of the race and outbraked Ickx into the Tarzan hairpin, on the inside in a classic passing manoeuvre, at the start of lap 3. Colin Chapman had persisted with anti-squat and dive on John Miles&#x27; Lotus 72 which was fifth on the first lap and proved difficult to pass. This assisted Team Lotus as it was much easier for Rindt to thread past the four car duel for fifth on lap 29–32 than for Ickx or Jackie Stewart who spent 7 laps getting past Jack Brabham, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, John Surtees and Miles Miles in the second 72 was finally being passed by Beltoise on lap 49, when a large wave over the coast dunes saw Miles lose adhesion and Surtees did finally claim the 6th place and the final point by passing John Miles&#x27; Lotus, which was brakeless by then, 4 laps from the flag. However the race was marred by the violent fatal accident of British driver Piers Courage driving the Frank Williams-entered De Tomaso-Ford on lap 22, at Tunnel Oost, when his car&#x27;s suspension was damaged after hitting a curb, and the car went straight up a grass embankment. It then somersaulted and exploded, and Courage had died instantly after being hit on the head by one of the car&#x27;s front wheels. The flames were so intense, that trees surrounding the accident site, were lit up as a result. A similar accident occurred at the 1973 race, which claimed the life of Roger Williamson.

The 80-lap race was won from pole position by Austrian driver Jochen Rindt, driving a Lotus 72. Rindt took his third consecutive victory after Australian Jack Brabham, driving a Brabham BT33, ran out of fuel at the last corner while leading comfortably, and after Rindt himself had originally been disqualified for having an illegal rear wing. Brabham held on to second place, scoring what would turn out to be his final points in Formula One, with New Zealander Denny Hulme finishing third for McLaren.

This was the first Formula One race for Brazilian future World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi, who qualified 21st and finished eighth in an older Lotus 49. It was also the final F1 race for American Dan Gurney.

It was race 8 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 50-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jochen Rindt after he started from second position. Jacky Ickx finished second for the Ferrari team and McLaren driver Denny Hulme came in third.

On short notice following the drivers&#x27; demand for improved safety at the Nürburgring, the race was moved to Hockenheim for the first time in the history of the German Grand Prix as this track already had been fitted with Armco. F1 returned to an updated Nürburgring in 1971.

This was Rindt&#x27;s final win in his career before his death at the Italian Grand Prix that year at Monza.

<text>The 1970 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Mont-Tremblant on September 20, 1970. It was race 11 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 90-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx after he started from second position. His teammate Clay Regazzoni finished second and March driver Chris Amon came in third. This race marked the debut of Tyrrell Racing as a constructor. Stewart took pole position for the race in the first outing for the team. Tim Schenken finishing the race only 11 laps behind is the best a De Tomaso built car ever achieved.

<text>The 1970 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 4, 1970 at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 12 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The 108-lap race was won by Emerson Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus-Ford, after he started from third position. Fittipaldi achieved his first Formula One victory, and the first for a Brazilian driver, in only his fourth Grand Prix start. Mexican driver Pedro Rodríguez finished second in a BRM, having led before a late pit stop for fuel, while Fittipaldi&#x27;s Swedish team-mate Reine Wisell, making his F1 debut, finished third, which would turn out to be his only podium finish.

Belgian driver Jacky Ickx finished fourth in his Ferrari, having started from pole position before pitting to repair a broken fuel line. This result meant that Jochen Rindt became the first and, to date, only posthumous Formula One World Champion.

This would be the final Grand Prix for the circuit in this original fast configuration. 1971 would see a new longer layout presenting more of a challenge.

==Report==
The Ferrari of Jacky Ickx was fastest in the initial practice session on Friday with a time of 1:03.07, but expectations were high for the Tyrrell 001 of Jackie Stewart, which had led the first 31 laps in its first outing in the previous race in Canada until axle failure ended its charge. The final session on Saturday was marred by a downpour that left only fifteen minutes of dry track time, and it was not enough for Stewart to knock Ickx off the pole. Emerson Fittipaldi, who spent the first half of the season in European Formula Two, was just five hundredths behind Stewart in third.

On Sunday, with a crowd exceeding 100,000 for the second straight year, black clouds and a shower 20 minutes prior to the race caused a lot of excitement among the crews on the grid, as many teams changed to rain tires and back again. By the start, however, all but Clay Regazzoni and Derek Bell had reverted to slicks. Stewart took the lead off the grid, ahead of Pedro Rodríguez, as Fittipaldi dropped to eighth behind Ickx, Regazzoni, Chris Amon, John Surtees and Jackie Oliver.

By lap 17, the Ferraris of Ickx and Regazzoni had passed Rodríguez, but by that time, Stewart&#x27;s lead was nearly twenty seconds. Graham Hill, in a privately entered Lotus 72, came into the pits on lap 30 with fuel leaking into the cockpit, as a fitting had come loose under the seat. The team took 10 minutes to fix the leak, threw some water on Hill, whose overalls were soaked in fuel, and sent him back out. Several laps later, Hill returned to request they find him some dry overalls, as the gasoline was burning his skin. When he stopped again to change clothes, the team said they had not been able to locate any new ones. Hill, however, saw John Surtees, who had retired on the seventh lap, sitting on the wall, and borrowed his overalls and undergarments. The two former World Champions were naked in the pits as Hill was doused with water before donning Surtees&#x27; clean clothes and returning to the track, only to retire on lap 72 with a broken clutch.

At half-distance, Stewart was nearly half a lap ahead of Ickx, with Rodríguez in third and Fittipaldi about to be lapped in fourth. Ickx suddenly pitted on lap 57 to repair a broken fuel line, and he rejoined in twelfth place. He fought his way back up to fourth, setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap three laps from the finish. Ickx had needed to win to have a chance of overtaking Jochen Rindt in the Championship; his fourth-place finish meant that Rindt became the first posthumous Formula One World Champion.

On lap 76, with a one-minute cushion, Stewart&#x27;s Tyrrell began trailing smoke from its left-hand exhaust pipe. The smoke slowly grew worse, and Rodríguez tore into Stewart&#x27;s lead, taking off five seconds a lap, while the Lotus teammates unlapped themselves. On lap 83, with its oil gone, the Cosworth engine in the Tyrrell seized, leaving Rodríguez with an 18.8 second lead over Fittipaldi, who led team-mate Reine Wisell by another 46 seconds.

At the end of the 100th lap, Rodríguez coasted into the pit lane having run out of fuel. BRM refueled the car, but Rodríguez had lost 38 seconds to Fittipaldi, who took the lead. Rodríguez rejoined ahead of the second Lotus of Wisell.

Fittipaldi recalled later, &quot;I took the lead and, going over the finish line, I saw for the first time Colin [Chapman] jumping and throwing his hat, something I&#x27;d seen him do for Jim Clark and Graham Hill and Jochen, and I kept saying to myself, &#x27;He&#x27;s doing that for me. I won the race. I won the US Grand Prix!&#x27; It was unbelievable.&quot;

His victory was the seventh American win for Lotus, and it clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the team&#x27;s dead leader, Jochen Rindt, and the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Lotus and Colin Chapman.

This was the final Grand Prix to be held on the layout of the track, in use since 1956. Watkins Glen underwent extensive renovation over the course of 1971, including the lengthening of the track to in time for that year&#x27;s Grand Prix, with an interim layout adopted for the Six Hours sports car race beforehand.

<text>The 1970 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Ciudad Deportiva Magdalena Mixhuca in Mexico City on October 25, 1970. It was race 13 of 13 in both the 1970 World Championship of Drivers and the 1970 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 65-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Jacky Ickx after he started from third position. His teammate Clay Regazzoni finished second and McLaren driver Denny Hulme came in third.

Ickx was not able to close the points gap to the late Jochen Rindt in the final races of the season, and as a result, Rindt became the only driver ever to win the championship posthumously.

== Qualifying ==
=== Qualifying classification ===
== Race ==
The race was originally scheduled to start at 2:30pm but the crowd of 200,000 was difficult to control and almost forced the cancellation of the race. They were crammed in front of the guard-rails, sat at the trackside and ran across the track itself. Despite appeals from Jackie Stewart and local hero Pedro Rodríguez they still remained troublesome. It cause the start to be delayed to 4:00pm.

From the start, Jacky Ickx led from Stewart and Clay Regazzoni, but dropped back with steering column trouble. Later, a collision with a dog which had escaped onto the track damaged Stewart&#x27;s suspension and forced his retirement, leaving the Ferraris dominant in first and second. Jack Brabham retired from third place in his final Grand Prix when the engine blew on lap 53. The Ferraris romped home with Ickx leading Regazzoni and Denny Hulme claiming the third podium spot.

The crowd control issues led to the Mexican Grand Prix being dropped from the 1971 calendar. It returned to the Formula One calendar fifteen years later in 1986.

=== Classification ===
== Notes ==

* This was the 10th podium finish for a Swiss driver.
* This was the 50th fastest lap set by a Ferrari (as a constructor and as an engine supplier); a record.
* This race marked the 126th Grand Prix start for Jack Brabham; a record that would be broken by Graham Hill at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix.

<text>The 1971 South African Grand Prix, formally the Fifth AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Vyfde AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami Circuit on 6 March 1971. It was race 1 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by Mario Andretti who was driving for the Ferrari team in what was his first Formula One victory, but would not win another Formula One race until .

==Report==
It was expected the 12-cylinder cars would be dominant over the V8 Ford-Cosworths as Ferrari had won four out of the last five Grands Prix in , and they had a strong line-up consisting of Mario Andretti, Clay Regazzoni and Jacky Ickx.

Jackie Stewart took pole in the Tyrrell to join Chris Amon and Regazzoni on the front row. Denny Hulme was suffering with a new suspension that he said was behaving very strangely.

At the start, Regazzoni led the field away at the start – both Stewart and Amon suffering slow starts. Emerson Fittipaldi managed to hold off Hulme until lap three when he dived through to chase the Ferraris. On lap 17, he squeezed through under braking and the orange McLaren once again led a race. Pedro Rodríguez was forced to retire from fourth place when his bodywork started to melt and the hot air began burning his feet. The heat also took its toll on Jo Siffert, whose engine overheated and Howden Ganley who was taken ill with heat exhaustion. On lap 37, John Surtees who had steadily been moving up the field, managed to pass Regazzoni. Surtees however, suffered a gearbox failure on lap 57. Andretti took his first career victory, driving a Ferrari; his teammate Regazzoni finished in third place behind Stewart.

<text>The 1971 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on May 23, 1971. It was race 3 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers and the 200th World Championship Grand Prix held since the championship began in . This was the last race on the original Monaco circuit, as a dedicated pit lane was created along the harbor before Tabac in 1972.

Events of the race are captured in the documentary film &quot;Weekend of a Champion&quot; in which Roman Polanski shadows Jackie Stewart.

== Race report ==
Qualifying was extremely wet and so it was Friday morning times that really counted for the grid - for Mario Andretti this was particularly unfortunate as his car was stranded out on the track at this time and so he was unable to qualify despite lying second in the World Championship. Jackie Stewart claimed a stunning pole position over a second ahead of his front row companion Jacky Ickx and shot into an immediate lead from the fast-starting Jo Siffert, Ickx, Pedro Rodríguez, Ronnie Peterson and Denny Hulme. Chris Amon stalled on the grid and Graham Hill - seeking a 6th Monaco win - made a rare mistake, hitting the wall at Tabac on the 2nd lap.

Stewart extended his lead from Siffert and Ickx, despite being painfully ill from fumes leaking into the cockpit. Peterson was astonishing the crowd with his valiant attempts to take 4th place from Rodríguez, who was baulking him as much as was legally possible. Hulme actually managed to join the battle and pass Peterson on one lap. Eventually the Mexican slipped up under pressure and locked up a wheel to let both Peterson and Hulme through.

The Who used parts of the Grand Prix and showed Jackie Stewart in the music video for the song &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;.

It was race 4 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. Due to heavy rain, the track was treacherously wet and slippery, giving a large advantage to &quot;wet-weather men&quot; Jacky Ickx and Pedro Rodriguez, who also happened to be equipped with highly suitable cars and tyres.

This was the last Formula One race on a circuit with no safety features on it. Because of this the Dutch Grand Prix was canceled the next year, but the circuit came back in 1973; and the layout had been modified.

<text>The 1971 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit Paul Ricard on 4 July 1971. It was race 5 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 55-lap race was won by Tyrrell driver Jackie Stewart after he started from pole position. His teammate François Cevert finished second and Lotus driver Emerson Fittipaldi came in third.

== Race report ==

This was the first French Grand Prix to be held at the new Circuit Paul Ricard near Marseille. The Tyrrell team had new front bodywork for Jackie Stewart&#x27;s car, and the Briton gained pole position with this revised car – also helped by extensive tyre testing in the weeks before – from Clay Regazzoni, Jacky Ickx and Graham Hill. Stewart led away from Regazzoni, Pedro Rodríguez and Jean-Pierre Beltoise, whilst Ickx was jostled through the first chicane and dropped back. Stewart streaked ahead, setting fastest lap on lap 2 and pulling out a 10-second lead by lap 7. His only real challenger, Regazzoni, hit a patch of oil and sailed into the guardrail, breaking a wheel on lap 20. On lap 28 Rodríguez dropped out with a faulty coil, leaving the Tyrrells in 1–2 formation, with François Cevert proving his worth on his home ground. Hill dropped out of fifth place with a broken oil pipe, having previously hit the guardrail whilst avoiding Regazzoni.

This left Jo Siffert in third place, holding off Emerson Fittipaldi, who was in pain and heavily bandaged after a road accident. Despite this, the Brazilian took 3rd on lap 39. Siffert retook this briefly, but Fittipaldi held on for the final podium place from the Swiss. Chris Amon took 5th in an unconvincing performance by home team Matra, duelling with Tim Schenken until Schenken ran out of oil 6 laps from the end.

It was a 1–2 success for the Tyrrells on a tricky circuit, the Cosworth DFV engine providing extra power down the very long Mistral straight.

This was to be Pedro Rodríguez&#x27;s last Formula One race. He was killed a week later while driving a privately entered Ferrari 512 at an Interserie sports car race at the Norisring in Germany.

<text>The 1971 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 17 July 1971. It was race 6 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 68-lap race was won by Tyrrell driver Jackie Stewart after he started from second position. Ronnie Peterson finished second for the March team and Lotus driver Emerson Fittipaldi came in third.

== Race report ==

On one of the fastest circuits on the calendar, horsepower counted for everything. Clay Regazzoni, driving for Ferrari, gained pole with a scorching lap of 1 min 18.1 secs, beating Jackie Stewart in a Tyrrell and Jo Siffert in a BRM by just a couple of hundredths of a second. BRM were mourning the loss of Pedro Rodríguez in a sports car race a few days earlier.

The start itself was a shambles, with a bungled flag drop causing a collision between Jackie Oliver and Graham Hill, for which Oliver was fined £50. Regazzoni led away from Jacky Ickx and Stewart, but after just one lap Stewart had passed Ickx, with Siffert following him. On lap 4, Stewart passed Regazzoni and disappeared into the distance. By lap 10 he was over 3 seconds ahead. In the points positions, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ronnie Peterson and Tim Schenken were having a memorable tussle. Regazzoni repassed Siffert who was suffering from vibration problems on lap 15, but the BRM driver managed to hang on to the back of the Ferrari for several more laps. Stewart increased his lead to 14 seconds and by lap 20 he was ahead by 18 seconds. Ickx dropped out of fourth place with rubber breaking off from his front left tyre, and Siffert dropped way down with a broken coil bracket. The battle between Peterson, Schenken and Fittipaldi moved up into 3rd, 4th and 5th places.

On lap 48, tyre problems struck Regazzoni and further problems ensued when he tried to leave the pits after his tyre change to find his engine had no oil pressure. Schenken too dropped down the field with gearbox problems and retired completely when it jammed for good 4 laps from home.

Henri Pescarolo and Rolf Stommelen thus moved up into the battle for 4th and 5th, duelling right to the line, with Pescarolo winning out by just 0.5 seconds. John Surtees gained 6th place.

Stewart took a commanding home win and extended his lead in the Championship to 23 points.

<text>The 1971 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nürburgring on 1 August 1971. It was race 7 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The race returned to the Nürburgring after a year at the Hockenheimring after the safety was improved on the track. The race distance was shortened to 12 laps. Notable driver changes included Vic Elford replacing Pedro Rodríguez, who had been killed in a sports car race at Norisring the previous month. Jackie Stewart took pole and dominated the race, while François Cevert finished second, making it a Tyrrell 1–2. Cevert battled with and was stuck behind Clay Regazzoni for more than a quarter of the race; the Swiss driver finished 3rd. Mario Andretti, Ronnie Peterson and Tim Schenken rounded out the points. Mike Beuttler was disqualified on the third lap after entering the pits via the &quot;short chute&quot;, after suffering a flat tire just after passing the pits, and not wanting to drive 14 miles on a flat tire. Jo Siffert was also disqualified on lap seven for taking the short chute into the pits, after his right-hand lower front wishbone started detaching from the chassis and his ignition coil started acting up. With a lap distance of 12 laps the race formerly held the record for the fewest number of laps (official) in a Grand Prix until the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix which was classified after 1 lap after being red flagged.

<text>The 1971 Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Österreichring on 15 August 1971. It was race 8 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 54-lap race was won by BRM driver Jo Siffert after he started from pole position. Emerson Fittipaldi finished second for the Lotus team and Brabham driver Tim Schenken came in third. This was the debut race of the future world champion Niki Lauda.

== Race report ==

Jo Siffert took a surprise pole position from Jackie Stewart and led away at the start from Clay Regazzoni and Jacky Ickx. The front two drew away from the pack, where Regazzoni was duelling with François Cevert and Ickx was dropping back with mechanical problems. On lap 21, Stewart with a poorly handling car allowed Cevert through so he could chase Siffert. Further down the field, there were two Brabham-Lotus battles, with Tim Schenken duelling with Emerson Fittipaldi and Reine Wisell trading places with Graham Hill. By lap 32, Ickx had retired with a spark plug problem, Regazzoni had an engine blow up and Fittipaldi had passed Schenken and set about catching Stewart.

On lap 36, Stewart&#x27;s race ended with a violent accident - his left rear driveshaft broke and the wheel was torn off. He emerged unhurt to be greeted as World Champion following Ickx&#x27;s retirement. Cevert was chasing down Siffert, but with 12 laps to go his gearbox exploded.

Fittipaldi was now carving chunks out the BRM&#x27;s lead, due to a left-rear puncture for the Swiss. However he managed to nurse the ailing car home for a popular victory by 4 seconds. Schenken was 3rd, with Wisell pipping Hill for 4th place - the Englishman was another to suffer a puncture in the dying stages and Henri Pescarolo finished 6th in his March. Stewart won the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 3 races left to go.

<text>The 1971 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 5 September 1971. It was race 9 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

This race featured the closest finish in Formula One history, as Peter Gethin beat Ronnie Peterson by 0.01 seconds. The top five were covered by just 0.61 seconds, with François Cevert finishing third, Mike Hailwood fourth and Howden Ganley fifth. With an average speed of , this race stood as the fastest-ever Formula One race for 32 years, until the 2003 Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Furthermore, it would turn out to be Gethin&#x27;s only Grand Prix victory before retiring from Formula One in 1974.

== Race report ==
The historical Monza National Autodrome, located just north of the northern Italian city of Milan, in 1971 became the fastest circuit used by Formula One after the Belgian Spa-Francorchamps circuit was removed from the calendar. However, this was the last year in which the circuit was used with this configuration: considering the enormous speed that the cars reached in this edition, two chicanes were introduced the following year in the two most dangerous curves of the track.

Emerson Fittipaldi drove a four-wheel drive Lotus 56B powered by a gas turbine, the only time he would race in a Formula One World Championship race in a car not powered by a Ford Cosworth DFV engine. Due to ongoing legal issues between Team Lotus and the Italian authorities following Jochen Rindt&#x27;s death the previous year, the car was entered under the name &quot;World Wide Racing&quot;.

With the championship settled, this was an opportunity for new drivers to prove themselves. Chris Amon in the Matra proved an embarrassment to Ferrari by seizing pole at their home track with the fastest lap of all time in a Formula One championship race, lapping at , with the BRMs on the second row, whilst champion Stewart was in 6th after suffering gearbox problems. Mike Hailwood was making his debut for Surtees—an inspired choice as he held both the Formula 5000 and motorbike lap records for Monza.
Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari thrilled the crowd by surging forward from the fourth row to lead from Jo Siffert and Stewart until lap 3, when Ronnie Peterson took the lead. On lap 7, Stewart took the lead. By lap 16, Stewart and Jacky Ickx retired with engine problems, followed two laps later by Clay Regazzoni. The race began to break into high-speed packs—the leading one containing Hailwood (leading on his debut), François Cevert, Peterson, Siffert, Howden Ganley, Chris Amon, Peter Gethin and Jackie Oliver. Gethin, Peterson, Cevert, Hailwood and Ganley (who fell back slightly) battled right down to the line and the top 4 finished within two-tenths of a second of each other, with Ganley a further four-tenths back in fifth. Polesitter Amon took the last point in sixth, nearly half a minute behind Ganley.
Siffert dropped back after problems with a gearbox that would only select fourth gear. Tyrrell-Ford won their first Constructors&#x27; Championship with two races remaining.

<text>The 1971 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park on September 19, 1971. It was race 10 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

During a Formula Ford preliminary race, one of the twenty drivers of the field spun at Turn 1 involving four other competitors and a group of marshals. Four of them suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital. One lap later, Wayne Kelly, a 37-year-old driver from Ottawa, was killed instantly when he crashed into a stationary ambulance parked on the outside of Turn 1 whose crew was helping the injured marshals and competitors.

The events of the Formula Ford race meant that the Grand Prix was delayed from its 2:30pm start to 4:30pm, and when it did start, it was raining and thick fog had arrived. Jackie Stewart took the win after the race was stopped after 64 laps of the scheduled 80 due to the weather. American Mark Donohue finished third on his F1 debut.

This was the first ever Formula One race to be red flagged.

<text>The 1971 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 3, 1971, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York. It was race 11 of 11 in both the 1971 World Championship of Drivers and the 1971 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 59-lap race was won by Tyrrell driver François Cevert after he started from fifth position. Jo Siffert finished second for the BRM team and March driver Ronnie Peterson came in third.

==Summary==
Jackie Stewart&#x27;s domination in 1971 clinched his second Driver&#x27;s Championship with three races remaining, but the final round belonged to his Tyrrell teammate, François Cevert. The Frenchman took the lead from Stewart on lap 14 and went on to claim his only career win, the first GP victory for a French driver since Maurice Trintignant in 1958.

As usual, the American race attracted a large field of entrants, despite it being the last race of the year and both Championships having long been wrapped up. It seemed nearly every spare works F1 car and quite a few independents, as well, were present to try for a share of the $267,000 in prize money, easily the richest purse in F1. Unfortunately, the two most popular American drivers, Mario Andretti and Mark Donohue, who was fresh from a stunning third-place finish in Canada in his Formula One debut in a Penske-White Racing entered McLaren were committed to drive on Sunday in a USAC race which had been rescheduled to the GP weekend after it had been called off on the previous weekend because of extremely heavy rain. The two drivers qualified, Andretti in a Ferrari and Donohue in a Penske-White Racing entered McLaren shared with David Hobbs, hoping for more rain in New Jersey and the chance to return for the race on Sunday.

Since the previous year&#x27;s race, the course had been resurfaced, widened and, most significantly, lengthened by a mile to 3.377 miles with an entirely new section at the southwest corner called the &quot;Boot&quot; or &quot;Anvil&quot;. The pits were also moved from the north end straight back before the right angle turn known as &quot;The 90,&quot; which now became Turn One.

Friday was sunny and hot (), and Stewart jumped immediately to the top of the charts with a time of 1:42.844, as the times were recorded to a thousandth of a second for the first time. On Saturday, with the temperature now 110° and both Goodyear&#x27;s and Firestone&#x27;s qualifying tires breaking down after a few laps, Emerson Fittipaldi pipped Stewart&#x27;s time from the day before, but the Scot returned to the track and grabbed the pole by .017 of a second. Denny Hulme joined them on the front row in his McLaren, followed by Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari, Cevert and the soon-to-be-absent Andretti. American Peter Revson qualified nineteenth in the third Tyrrell. It was his only race for Tyrrell and his first Grand Prix since 1964.

===Race===
Sunday was dry in both upstate New York and Trenton, New Jersey, and word came that the USAC race would go on meaning that both Andretti and Donohue would be unable to start the race with Hobbs substituting for Donohue in the Penske-White Racing entered McLaren dismaying both the crowd and the organizers, who were robbed of seeing two of the country&#x27;s best road racers. At the start, Denny Hulme jumped into the lead, ahead of Cevert and Stewart, but by the end of the first lap, Stewart led Hulme, Cevert, Regazzoni, Jo Siffert, Jacky Ickx, Chris Amon and Fittipaldi.

At first, Stewart was able to open a gap back to the following group, now headed by his teammate, but after ten laps, his tires began to go off and the gap closed. The Scot realized that Cevert&#x27;s Goodyears were holding up much better in the heat, and when Cevert closed up right behind him, he waved him by on lap 14. Hulme was now struggling with a terrible vibration in his tires and was passed, first by Ickx, then Regazzoni and Siffert. On lap 15, American Sam Posey, in his first Grand Prix, retired from a fine run with a blown piston in his Surtees. By the time Ickx could get around Stewart on lap 17, Cevert&#x27;s lead was 5.7 seconds.

At about half-distance, Cevert finally began to struggle with the same understeer that had plagued Stewart much earlier. Ickx was closing, and his Firestones were getting better as the race went on. On lap 43, the Belgian set the fastest lap of the race, and the gap was down to 2.2 seconds. Then, on lap 49, the Ferrari&#x27;s alternator fell off, punching a hole in the gearbox and spilling oil all over the track! Hulme hit the oil and spun into the barrier, bending his front suspension. He was standing beside the track when Cevert came by and also hit the barrier, but kept going, now 29 seconds in the lead!

Jo Siffert was now in second place and 33 seconds clear of Ronnie Peterson. With four laps to go, however, Siffert began to run low on fuel. The Swede took huge chunks off the gap as Siffert jerked the BRM from side to side, trying to use every remaining drop of fuel. Cevert coasted home, taking both hands off the wheel to wave as he crossed the line, and Siffert weaved his way around to hold second place by four seconds over Peterson&#x27;s March.

After taking the checkered flag, Cevert gave a nod to his teammate. &quot;I feel pretty good with a $50,000 win. I followed Stewart in the beginning and was flagged on ahead. Jackie Stewart is a very sensible driver and a very good teacher. He let me go through.&quot; While it was the first race on the expanded Watkins Glen track, it was the third year in a row that The Glen had rewarded a driver with his first career victory. This was Cevert&#x27;s only victory in Formula One.

<doc id="1122506" wikidata="Q926391" url="?curid=1122506" title="Green River (album)">
<text>Green River is the third studio album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released on August 7, 1969, by Fantasy Records. It was the second of three albums they released in that year, preceded by &quot;Bayou Country&quot; in January and followed by &quot;Willy and the Poor Boys&quot; in October.

==Background==
In January 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival released their second studio album &quot;Bayou Country&quot; featuring their breakout single &quot;Proud Mary&quot; (backed with &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;), which reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Producer and primary songwriter John Fogerty was the driving creative force behind CCR, which would record three albums in 1969 alone. The band saw themselves as more disciplined than other San Francisco-based bands, with drummer Doug Clifford recalling to Jeb Wright of &quot;Goldmine&quot; in 2013, &quot;We went to see the local bands and they were so stoned they weren’t even in tune and they were really terrible...We made a pact on the floor of the Fillmore, right then, where we would do no drugs or alcohol. We decided to get high on the music, or get out of the business.&quot; Going against the grain at the times, Creedence eschewed the acid-inspired free-form jams favored by many rock bands, for tightly structured roots music with an unmistakable rockabilly edge. &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the idea of those acid-rock, 45-minute guitar solos,&quot; Fogerty explained to &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s David Cavanagh in 2012. &quot;I thought music should get to the point a little more quickly than that.&quot;

==Composition==
CCR&#x27;s third studio album includes two of their biggest hits, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and &quot;Green River&quot;, both of which peaked on the U.S. chart at No. 2, as well as the highly regarded &quot;Lodi&quot; (No. 52) and &quot;Commotion&quot; (No. 30). &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; is notable for its jaunty, happy music juxtaposed with its dark, ominous lyrics. It was inspired by a scene in the 1941 film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; involving a hurricane, with John Fogerty stating that the words told of &quot;the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us. It wasn&#x27;t until the band was learning the song that I realized the dichotomy. Here you got this song with all these hurricanes and blowing and raging ruin and all that, but...It&#x27;s a happy-sounding tune, right? Regarding the title track, Fogerty recalled in 1993:Green River is really about this place where I used to go as a kid on Putah Creek, near Winters, California. I went there with my family every year until I was ten. Lot of happy memories there. I learned how to swim there. There was a rope hanging from the tree. Certainly dragonflies, bullfrogs. There was a little cabin we would stay in owned by a descendant of Buffalo Bill Cody. That&#x27;s the reference in the song to Cody Jr. The actual specific reference, &quot;Green River,&quot; I got from a soda pop-syrup label. You used to be able to go into a soda fountain, and they had these bottles of flavored syrup. My flavor was called Green River. It was green, lime flavored, and they would empty some out over some ice and pour some of that soda water on it, and you had yourself a Green River.In 2012, Fogerty stated:

The somber &quot;Lodi&quot; did not make the Top 40 but went on to become a rock radio staple and a fan favorite. It describes the plight of a down-and-out musician whose career has landed him playing a gig in the town of Lodi (pronounced &quot;low-die&quot;), a small agricultural city in California&#x27;s Central Valley about 70 miles from Fogerty&#x27;s hometown of Berkeley. After playing in local bars, the narrator finds himself stranded and unable to raise bus or train fare to leave. Fogerty later said he had never actually visited Lodi before writing the song, and simply picked it for the song because it had &quot;the coolest sounding name.&quot; However, the song unquestionably references the town&#x27;s reputation as an uninteresting farm settlement (the song&#x27;s chorus, &quot;Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again&quot;, has been the theme of several city events in Lodi).

&quot;Commotion&quot; has been cited as a metaphor for the social and political unrest that America was experiencing at the time. Fogerty asserted in 2012 to &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;I didn’t think &#x27;Commotion&#x27; was social commentary, ’cause all this stuff was just in the air. But I was writing about what was in the air, and that was what came out of me. I was just doing what came naturally.&quot;

Other significant tracks on the album include the lament &quot;Wrote a Song for Everyone&quot;, which, according to the VH1 &quot;Legends&quot; episode on the group, deals with Fogerty&#x27;s failing marriage, and the Ray Charles cover &quot;The Night Time Is the Right Time&quot;, continuing the Creedence tradition of including classic R&amp;B and early rock and roll songs on their studio albums, as they had with Dale Hawkins&#x27; &quot;Susie Q&quot; (1968&#x27;s &quot;Creedence Clearwater Revival&quot;) and Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; (1969&#x27;s &quot;Bayou Country&quot;). In 2012 &quot;Uncut&quot; called &quot;Cross Tie Walker&quot; &quot;a quintessential Johnny Cash two-step with a nifty bassline and a tale about a hobo hopping a train and starting a new life.&quot; The phrase &quot;cross tie walker&quot; appears earlier in the album, as part of the lyrics for &quot;Green River&quot;.

Although Fogerty was producing, arranging and writing all the songs at this point, as well as handling lead guitar and singing duties, bassist Stu Cook insisted to Bill Kopp of musoscribe.com, &quot;We didn&#x27;t always play the parts we were given. John showed us lots of stuff he wanted specifically in songs; songwriters often do that. They come up with a song, they have an arrangement they want to hear. Some things are important, and other things are less important. We had a sufficient amount of latitude in writing and arranging our parts.&quot; Although he has always maintained that the band&#x27;s artistic vision was solely his own, Fogerty himself conceded to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Michael Goldberg in 1993, &quot;Probably ninety-nine percent of the tracks we did as a quartet are played live with all four guys playing at the same room. I&#x27;ve heard the rumor over the years that &#x27;after they left the studio, John went in and re-recorded all the parts.&#x27; No. I think the charm of what you hear on those records is four guys really playing.&quot; However, Fogerty has always maintained that the ideas for Creedence were his; in 1998 he asserted to Harold Steinblatt of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;Many times — in fact, most of the time — they never heard the melodies until after the record came out...I showed the band how each part went — I showed them the music that fit the song I had written.&quot;

In March, prior to recording the album, Creedence conducted a test session at the recently built Wally Heider Studios, where they recorded three instrumental test tracks (two of which, &quot;Broken Spoke Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Glory Be&quot;, are included in the 2008 remastered CD). The recording sessions for &quot;Green River&quot; lasted until June.

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a great album&quot; with the reviewer further stating &quot;they are now creating the most &quot;vivid&quot; American rock since &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;&quot;.
AllMusic gave the album 5 stars (out of 5) with Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating: &quot;If anything, CCR&#x27;s third album &quot;Green River&quot; represents the full flower of their classic sound initially essayed on its predecessor, &quot;Bayou Country&quot;.&quot; John Fogerty has stated many times that &quot;Green River&quot; is his favorite Creedence album, telling Tom Pinnock of &quot;Uncut&quot; in 2013, &quot;“Green River” was my favourite song from the Creedence era, because it really had the whole Sun Records vibe to me – and the album, too.&quot;

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 16, 1970; twenty years later it was certified triple Platinum on December 13, 1990.

== Legacy ==
In 2003, &quot;Green River&quot; was ranked number 95 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It features two of the band&#x27;s best-known songs, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and the title track. The album was remastered and reissued on 180-gram vinyl by Analogue Productions in 2006.

<doc id="1122541" wikidata="Q1550420" url="?curid=1122541" title="Nauru Regional Processing Centre">
<text>The Nauru Regional Processing Centre is an offshore Australian immigration detention facility in use from 2001 to 2008, from 2012 to 2019, and from September 2021. It is located on the South Pacific island nation of Nauru and run by the Government of Nauru. The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia.

The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard government&#x27;s Pacific Solution. The centre was suspended in 2008 to fulfil an election promise by the Rudd government, but was reopened in August 2012 by the Gillard government after a large increase in the number of maritime arrivals by asylum seekers and pressure from the Abbott opposition. Current Coalition and Labor Party policy states that because all detainees attempted to reach Australia by boat, they will never be settled in Australia, even though many of the asylum seekers detained on the island have been assessed as genuine refugees.

The highest population at the centre was 1,233 detainees in August 2014. A number of detainees have since been returned to their countries of origin, including Iraq and Iran.

By November 2018, some refugees from Nauru (430 in total from both offshore facilities) had been resettled in the United States, but hopes of the United States taking more had faded. Although New Zealand had repeatedly offered to take 150 per year, the Australian Government refused. There were still 23 children on the island, as the government had bowed to public pressure and started removing families with children, after reports of suicidal behaviour and resignation syndrome had emerged.

In February 2019, the last four children on the island (of an original 200 in detention on Nauru in 2013) were resettled in the United States with their families. By 31 March 2019, there were no people held in the detention centre, which had been closed; however as of March 2020, there were 211 refugees and asylum seekers remaining on the island. As of 13 June 2020, a father and son were the last family left on Nauru; there was one single woman and the remaining people were single men.

In 2020, over 100 men from Manus and Nauru were being detained in a hotel in Brisbane, after being transferred to the mainland for medical treatment. They were confined to quarters under a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually released into the community in February 2021.

In September 2021 the Australian Government signed a new deal with Nauru to keep an ongoing form of asylum seeker processing centre on the island. There were around 107 asylum seekers remaining on Nauru as of July 2021.

The detainees at the centre have suffered serious human rights abuses and there are widespread reports of suicide and psychiatric illness.

==History==

===2001: Establishment===
The establishment of an offshore processing centre on Nauru was based on a Statement of Principles, signed on 10 September 2001 by the President of Nauru, René Harris, and Australia&#x27;s then-Minister for Defence, Peter Reith. The statement opened the way to establish a detention centre for up to 800 people and was accompanied by a pledge of 20 million for development activities. The initial detainees were to be people rescued by the &quot;MV Tampa&quot;, with the understanding that they would leave Nauru by May 2002. Subsequently, a memorandum of understanding was signed on 11 December, boosting accommodation to 1,200 and the promised development activity by an additional $10 million.

Initial plans were for asylum seekers to be housed in modern, air-conditioned housing which had been built for the games of the International Weightlifting Federation. This plan was changed after landowners&#x27; requests for extra compensation were rejected. Two camps were built. The first camp, called &quot;Topside&quot;, was at an old sports ground and oval in the Meneng District (). The second camp, called &quot;State House&quot;, was on the site of the old Presidential quarters also in the Meneng District (). A month-long hunger strike began on 10 December 2003. It included mostly Hazara from Afghanistan rescued during the Tampa affair, who were protesting for the review of their cases.

By July 2005, 32 people were detained in Nauru as asylum seekers: 16 Iraqis, 11 Afghans, 2 Iranians, 2 Bangladeshis, and 1 Pakistani. All but two Iraqis were released to Australia, the last group of 25 leaving on 1 November 2005. The remaining two Iraqis stayed in custody for over a year. The last one was finally accepted by an undisclosed Scandinavian country after five years in detention, in January 2007. The other was in an Australian hospital at the time, and was later given permission to remain in Australia while his asylum case was being decided. In September 2006, a group of eight Burmese Rohingya men were transferred there from Christmas Island. On 15 March 2007 the Australian Government announced that 83 Tamils from Sri Lanka would be transferred from Christmas Island to the Nauru detention centre. They arrived in Nauru by the end of the month.

===2007: Closing===
In December 2007, newly elected Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that his country would no longer make use of the Nauru detention centre, and would put an immediate end to the &quot;Pacific Solution&quot;. The last remaining Burmese and Sri Lankan detainees were granted residency rights in Australia. Nauru reacted with concern at the prospect of potentially losing much-needed aid from Australia.

===2012: Reopening===
In August 2012, the Labor government led by Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the resumption of the transfer of asylum seekers arriving by boat in Australia to Nauru (and Manus Island, PNG). Australia signed an initial Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nauru on 29 August 2012. The first group arrived the following month. The re-opening of the centres sparked criticism of Australia&#x27;s Labor government after the United Nations refused to assist the government on the mandatory measures. In November 2012, an Amnesty International team visited the camp and described it as &quot;a human rights catastrophe [...] a toxic mix of uncertainty, unlawful detention and inhumane conditions&quot;.

The MOU between Nauru and Australia was renegotiated on 3 August 2013. Clause 12 of the 2013 MOU allows for resettlement of refugees in Nauru:
&quot;The Republic of Nauru undertakes to enable Transferees who it determines are in need of international protection to settle in Nauru, subject to agreement between Participants on arrangements and numbers&quot;.

=== July 2013: Riot ===
On 19 July 2013 a riot occurred at the detention centre and caused $60 million dollars worth in damage. Police and guards had rocks and sticks thrown at them. Four people were hospitalised with minor injuries. Other people were treated for bruising and cuts. The riot began at 3 p.m. when the detainees staged a protest. Up to 200 detainees escaped and about 60 were held overnight at the island&#x27;s police station. Several vehicles and buildings including accommodation blocks for up to 600 people, offices, dining room, and the health centre were destroyed by fire. This is about 80 percent of the centre&#x27;s buildings. 129 of 545 male detainees were identified as being involved in the rioting and were detained in the police watch house.

In October 2015 Nauru declared that the asylum seekers housed in the detention centre now had freedom of movement around the island. Given reports that three women had been raped and numerous other assaults have taken place against asylum seekers it was reported that this might actually increase the amount of danger to them.

=== November 2016: United States resettlement deal ===

In November 2016 it was announced that a deal had been made with the United States to resettle people in detention on Nauru and Manus Islands. There is very little public information available about how many of these refugees will be resettled by the United States; initial reports however estimated up to 1,250 refugees would be resettled from Nauru and Manus Island. Then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull indicated that the priority is &quot;very much on the most vulnerable&quot;, particularly families on Nauru. On 27 February 2017, the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection told a Senate Estimates Committee that preliminary screening had started as part of the resettlement deal, but officials from the United States Department of Homeland Security had not yet been authorised to start formally vetting applicants.

===February 2019: The Last children off Nauru, &quot;Medevac&quot; bill passed===

On 3 February 2019, prime minister Scott Morrison announced that the last four families with children left on Nauru were about to leave for the US. They would be the last of the more than 200 children who had been held on the island when the Coalition won government in 2013.

On 13 February 2019, a bill which became known as the &quot;Medevac bill&quot; was narrowly passed by the Australian parliament allowing doctors to have more say in the process by which asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru may be medically evacuated and brought to the mainland for treatment. The approval of two doctors is required, but approval may still be overridden by the home affairs minister in one of three areas. Human rights advocates hailed the decision, with one calling it a “tipping point as a country”, with the weight of public opinion believing that sick people need treatment.

===August–September 2019: update on numbers===
The Australian government reported that as of 28 August 2019 there were 288 people left on Nauru; 330 had been resettled in the US; and another 85 people had been approved for resettlement in the US, but had not yet left.

It was reported that as of 30 September, total numbers of asylum seekers left in PNG and Nauru was 562 (23 percent of the peak, in June 2014), and another 1,117 people had been &quot;temporarily transferred to Australia for medical treatment or as accompanying family members&quot;. Numbers for each facility were not given separately.

===March–May 2020===
In March 2020, Home Affairs told the Senate estimates committee that &quot;211 refugees and asylum seekers remained on Nauru, 228 in Papua New Guinea, and about 1,220, including their dependents, were in Australia to receive medical treatment&quot;. Transfer and resettlement of approved refugees in the US was proceeding during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===June 2020: Brisbane===

As of June 2020, over 100 men from Manus and Nauru were being detained in an hotel in Kangaroo Point in Brisbane, after being transferred to the mainland for medical treatment. They were confined to quarters under a lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. The men held protests from their balconies, and protesters gathered outside on several occasions. The 25 men were released into the community in February 2021.

===September 2021: New Agreement===

In September 2021, the Minister for Home Affairs signed a new deal with Nauru to keep an ongoing form of asylum seeker processing centre on the island.

On 6 October 2021, the Australian Government passed responsibility for the remaining 124 men on PNG to the PNG Government. The remaining men were told that their options were either to transfer to Nauru or resettling in PNG. The official number of asylum seekers on Nauru was 107 on 31 July 2021. The operators of the facility, Canstruct, made a profit of at least per detainee in the financial year ending mid-2021. there were 115 held by Australia on Nauru, costing the government more than $4m per year per asylum seeker (nearly $12,000 per day).

===2023: Indefinite Detention Ruled Unlawful===
On 8 November 2023, the High Court of Australia ruled that it was unlawful for people to be indefinitely detained in immigration detention, twenty years after it had ruled it constitutionally valid.

On 7 September 2023, eleven people, the first in nine years, were transferred to the detention centre.

==Operators==
* 2012 – October 2017: Broadspectrum (formerly known as Transfield Services) subcontracted Wilson Security to perform the operations at Manus and Nauru. In September 2016 Wilson announced that it would be withdrawing at the end of its contract in October 2017, citing damage to its reputation, and Ferrovial, major owner of Broadspectrum, also announced that it would cease providing services to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection at the same date.
**In January 2017, the Australian National Audit Office published an audit of the government&#x27;s contract management of security and support services at the offshore processing centres. The report found &quot;The Department of Immigration and Border Protection’s management of the garrison support and welfare services contracts at the offshore processing centres... has fallen well short of effective contract management practice.&quot; It went on to highlight several weaknesses and gave three recommendations.
* October 2017 – present: The Brisbane firm Canstruct International contract signed a contract with the Australian Government, initially worth over $591 million. The company made more than $43m profit it its first financial year (ending 30 June 2018). It was intended that control should be handed over to a Nauruan Government commercial entity, the Nauru Regional Processing Centre Corporation on 31 October, but the date was pushed forward. At the time of the handover to Canstruct, the company had assets of $8. In the financial year ending mid-2021, Canstruct made a profit of , which works out to over $500,000 for each detainee (then fewer than 200).

==Conditions and human rights issues==
On 19 July 2013, there was a major riot in the detention centre. Several buildings were destroyed by fire, and damage was estimated at $60 million. Hunger strikes and self-harm, including detainees sewing their lips together, have been reported at the facility, as well as at least two people setting themselves on fire. Attempted suicides were also reported. Medical staff have been provided by International Organization for Migration.
An overwhelming sense of despair has been repeatedly expressed by detainees because of the uncertainty of their situation and their remoteness from loved ones. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as &quot;like a concentration camp&quot;.

In 2015, several staff members from the detention centre wrote an open letter claiming that multiple instances of sexual abuse against women and children had occurred. The letter claimed that the Australian government had been aware of these abuses for over 18 months.
This letter added weight to the Moss review which found it possible that &quot;guards had traded marijuana for sexual favours with asylum seeker children&quot;.

In 2018, reports of children engaging in self-harm and attempting suicide drew attention back to the conditions at the centre. Children as young as eight were documented as exhibiting suicidal behaviours, and an estimated 30 children were described as suffering from &quot;resignation syndrome&quot;, a supposedly progressive, deteriorating psychiatric condition. Extreme trauma experienced both in their country of origin and in their daily lives at the camp, coupled with a sense of hopelessness and abandonment, are thought to have contributed to the onset of this condition.

===Media access===
Media access to the island of Nauru, and the Regional Processing Centre in particular, is tightly controlled by the Nauruan government. In January 2014, the Nauru government announced it was raising the cost of a media visa to the island from AUD$200 to $8,000, non-refundable if the visa was not granted. Since then journalists from Al Jazeera, the ABC, SBS and &quot;The Guardian&quot; have stated that they have applied for media visas with no success. The last journalist to visit the island before the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders was Nick Bryant of the BBC.

In 2014 the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) made it a crime, punishable with up to a 10-year prison sentence, to disclose any special intelligence operation, including relating to asylum seekers. This provided little protection to journalists seeking to report on information from whistle-blowers. It caused professional journalists as well as teachers and health professionals employed in these detention centres, to be silenced. Journalists were prevented from entering or reporting and staff members were gagged under employment contracts that prevented them from speaking about anything happening in Australia&#x27;s offshore detention centre, under threat of a prison sentence. The Secrecy and Disclosure Provisions of the 1 July 2015 Australian Border Force Act ruled that workers who spoke of any incidents from within one of the centres would receive a 2-year prison sentence. This was later watered down in amendments put forward by Peter Dutton in August 2017, after doctors and other health professionals had mounted a high court challenge. The amendments would apply retrospectively and stipulated that the secrecy provision would only apply to information that could compromise Australia&#x27;s security, defence or international relations, interfere with criminal investigations offences, or affect sensitive personal or commercial matters.

In October 2015, Chris Kenny, a political commentator for &quot;The Australian&quot;, became the first Australian journalist to visit Nauru in over 18 months. While on the island, Kenny interviewed a Somali refugee known as &quot;Abyan&quot;, who alleged she had been raped on Nauru and requested an abortion of the resulting pregnancy. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre accused Kenny of forcing his way into Abyan&#x27;s quarters to speak to her—a claim Kenny strongly denied. In June 2016, the Press Council of Australia dismissed a complaint regarding the wording of his article and its headline.

In June 2016, a television crew from &quot;A Current Affair&quot; was granted access to the island and the centre. Reporter Caroline Marcus presented asylum seekers housed in fully equipped demountable units, and provided with their own television, microwave, airconditioning units and refrigerator. In a column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and an interview with &quot;ACA&quot; host Tracy Grimshaw, Marcus denied that there were any conditions on the crew&#x27;s visit, and stated that the Australian government had been unaware of the crew being granted visas until after they had arrived on the island.

<text>The Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV, English: Confederation of Workers of Venezuela) is a federation of labor unions in Venezuela.

== History ==
The union federation has been a consistent and key opponent of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In the year 2001, two years after his first election to President, Chávez&#x27;s government ordered the union federation to undertake its first-ever direct leadership elections. Although the Supreme Court refused to certify the results, the winner Carlos Ortega assumed the presidency. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) condemned Chávez&#x27;s interference in the affairs of free trade unions.

In 2002 and 2003, the CTV received funding from the United States&#x27; National Endowment for Democracy via the American Center for International Labor Solidarity.

In 2003, a new union federation, the &quot;Unión Nacional de Trabajadores de Venezuela&quot; (UNT, National Union of Workers) was started by people in the labor movement who supported Chávez. Some unions disaffiliated with the CTV and affiliated with the UNT.

<doc id="1122545" wikidata="Q171813" url="?curid=1122545" title="1972 South African Grand Prix">
<text>The 1972 South African Grand Prix, formally the Sixth AA Grand Prix of South Africa (Afrikaans: &quot;Sesde AA Suid-Afrikaanse Grand Prix&quot;), was a Formula One motor race held at Kyalami on 4 March 1972. It was race 2 of 12 in both the 1972 World Championship of Drivers and the 1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 79-lap race was won by McLaren driver Denny Hulme after he started from fifth position. Emerson Fittipaldi finished second for the Lotus team and McLaren driver Peter Revson came in third.

==Report==

===Entry===

A total of 27 cars were entered for this race. Although there was more than a month between the Argentine Grand Prix and South Africa, most cars were transported direct to Kyalami from Buenos Aires. There were few changes in the entry.

Having missed the trip to Argentina due to a clashing Formula 5000 race, Mike Hailwood returned to Team Surtees. Jean-Pierre Beltoise also missed Buenos Aires, due to legal problems following an accident that had claimed the life of Ignazio Giunti in January 1971. Team Williams ran a second March-Cosworth for rising star Carlos Pace alongside their regular driver, Henri Pescarolo. A new team arrived in South Africa, the Team Eifelland Caravans outfit making its first appearance with Rolf Stommelen down to drive. As usual for Kyalami, the field was bolstered by local entries: Dave Charlton in a Lucky Strike-sponsored Lotus 72D, and pair of cars from Team Gunston for John Love (Surtees TS9) and Willie Ferguson (Brabham BT33).

===Qualifying===

The reigning World Champion, and winner of the opening round, Jackie Stewart secured pole position, for Elf Team Tyrrell, averaging a speed of 119.221 mph. Stewart beat Clay Regazzoni (Ferrari) and Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus) by a few tenth of a second. Mike Hailwood was next up on the second row, joined by Denny Hulme in his McLaren M19A. A pair of Ferrari 312B2 were on row three, with Mario Andretti ahead of Jacky Ickx. They were joined by François Cevert in the second Tyrrell.

===Race===

The race was held over 79 laps of the Kyalami circuit. At the start, Denny Hulme briefly held the lead before Jackie Stewart moved ahead, meanwhile Clay Regazzoni had a bad get away and was back in the midfield. The Tyrrell 003 of Stewart quickly built a lead while the battle for second between Hulme, Emerson Fittipaldi and Mike Hailwood detached itself from the rest of the field. The Yardley Team McLaren of Hulme began to overheat and this saw him dropped behind his rivals. Hailwood, a few laps later, was able to pass Fittipaldi to move up to second and began to challenge Stewart for the lead. On lap 28, the rear suspension of Hailwood&#x27;s Surtees TS9B failed and he retired from the race. Although this left Fittipaldi to attack Stewart, the Tyrrell driver stayed ahead, only to suffer a gearbox failure on lap 45. Fittipaldi inherited the lead, with Hulme right on his tail. The Brazilian now ran into handling problems and this enable Hulme to regain the lead on lap 57, from which he would go to win. Fittipaldi was still in a strong second place as the gap between him and the third place, Chris Amon was large. The gap became even bigger where Amon&#x27;s Matra MS120C developed a serious vibration. This saw him drop down the order and finish 3 laps adrift in 15th. Third place thus went to the second McLaren, of Peter Revson.

Hulme won in a time of 1hr 45.49.1mins., averaging a speed of 114.898 mph, and was over 14 seconds ahead of Fititpaldi. Revson was a further 12.7 seconds behind. Only other drivers to complete the full race distance were Mario Andretti (Ferrari) and Ronnie Peterson (March). This victory gave Hulme a six-point the lead in the World Championship.

<text>The 1972 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Jarama on May 1, 1972. It was race 3 of 12 in both the 1972 World Championship of Drivers and the 1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race marked the first time two brothers raced together in F1 simultaneously, Emerson and Wilson Fittipaldi. The elder Fittipaldi was a last-minute substitute for Brabham&#x27;s Carlos Reutemann, who had injured his ankle in a Formula 2 race the previous weekend at Thruxton, England. The 90-lap race was won by Lotus driver Emerson Fittipaldi after he started from third position. Jacky Ickx finished second for the Ferrari team and his teammate Clay Regazzoni came in third. After the race the World Drivers&#x27; Championship was tied at 15 points between Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme.

== Qualifying classification ==
== Classification ==
== Notes ==

* This was the Formula One World Championship debut for Brazilian driver Wilson Fittipaldi, jr.

It was race 4 of 12 in both the 1972 World Championship of Drivers and the 1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The track was substantially modified from 1971, in the interest of safety. The pits were moved to the harbor front, between the chicane and Tabac, and a new chicane was placed near Tabac. Jean-Pierre Beltoise&#x27;s victory was the only one of his Formula One World Championship career as well as the last win for the BRM team and the first win for a Marlboro-sponsored F1 car.

<text>The 1972 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Nivelles on 4 June 1972. It was race 5 of 12 in both the 1972 World Championship of Drivers and the 1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 85-lap race was won by Lotus driver Emerson Fittipaldi after he started from pole position. François Cevert finished second for the Tyrrell team and McLaren driver Denny Hulme came in third.

Reigning World Champion Jackie Stewart was a notable absence – his gruelling schedule of racing in Formula 1, Can-Am and European touring cars, plus promotional events for Tyrrell sponsors Elf and Ford, as well as a sideline of sports commentating on television in the US led to what was originally diagnosed as an ulcer, but was later confirmed as gastritis. Under doctor&#x27;s orders, he took about three weeks off from everything, canceled his involvement with the Can-Am series and US TV for the remainder of 1972, and was restricting his schedule of everything else.

<text>Christopher Gale Langton (born 1948/49) is an American computer scientist and one of the founders of the field of artificial life. He coined the term in the late 1980s when he organized the first &quot;Workshop on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems&quot; (otherwise known as Artificial Life I) at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1987. Following his time at Los Alamos, Langton joined the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), to continue his research on artificial life. He left SFI in the late 1990s, and abandoned his work on artificial life, publishing no research since that time.

He was profiled extensively in chapters 6 and 8 of the book Complexity (1993), by M. Mitchell Waldrop.

==Artificial life==

Langton made numerous contributions to the field of artificial life, both in terms of simulation and computational models of given problems and to philosophical issues. Early on, he identified the problems of information, computation and reproduction as intrinsically connected with complexity and its basic laws. Inspired by ideas coming from physics, particularly phase transitions, he developed several key concepts and quantitative measures for cellular automata and suggested that critical points separating order from disorder could play a very important role in shaping complex systems, particularly in biology. These ideas were also explored simultaneously, albeit with different approximations, by James P. Crutchfield and Per Bak among others.

While a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Langton created the Langton ant and Langton loop, both simple artificial life simulations, in addition to his lambda parameter, a dimensionless measure of complexity and computation potential in cellular automata, given by a chosen state divided by all the possible states. For a 2-state, 1-r neighborhood, 1D cellular automata the value is close to 0.5. For a 2-state, Moore neighborhood, 2D cellular automata, like Conway&#x27;s Life, the value is 0.273.

==Personal life==
Langton is the first-born son of Jane Langton, author of books including the &quot;Homer Kelly Mysteries&quot;. He has two adult sons: Gabe and Colin. He is an atheist.

<text>The 1972 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Charade in Clermont-Ferrand, Auvergne, France on 2 July 1972. It was race 6 of 12 in both the 1972 World Championship of Drivers and the 1972 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

The Circuit de Charade&#x27;s natural setting around the base of an extinct volcano created safety concerns due to the dark, volcanic rocks which fell from the mountain onto both sides of the track. Drivers who skirted the track edge would often send rocks flying into the middle of the road and into the way of pursuing competitors. The hazard was highlighted when driver Helmut Marko suffered a career-ending injury during the race, when a stone thrown from Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s March penetrated his helmet visor and blinded him in the left eye. The rocks also meant that tyre punctures were a perennial hazard on the circuit, as was shown when ten competitors suffered punctures during the race. The French Grand Prix was moved to the new Circuit Paul Ricard for 1973.

Chris Amon achieved the fifth and final pole position of his career and was leading the race in his Matra until a puncture forced him to pit, leaving Jackie Stewart to win in his Tyrrell-Ford. Emerson Fittipaldi finished second, just ahead of a charging Amon, who shattered the circuit&#x27;s lap record.

Before the race, the Monza circuit was modified with the addition of two chicanes, one before the Curva Grande and one at the site of the old Curva Vialone, in order to reduce speeds in the interests of safety. Team Lotus was forced to run only one car because Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s Lotus 72D was seriously damaged in an accident while being transported to Monza. Fittipaldi raced another 72D, but with specifications very close to the 1970 model.

The 55-lap race was won by Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, driving a Lotus-Ford, after he started from sixth position. With the win, Fittipaldi sealed the Drivers&#x27; Championship, becoming the youngest ever champion at 25 years and 273 days until superseded by Fernando Alonso at 24 years and 59 days in 2005; Lotus also secured the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup. Englishman Mike Hailwood finished second in a Surtees-Ford, with New Zealander Denny Hulme third in a McLaren-Ford.

The race marked the last win for American tyre manufacturer Firestone in Formula One. It was also the last race in which 1964 World Champion John Surtees competed.

<text>The Chicago Daily News was an afternoon daily newspaper in the midwestern United States, published between 1875 and 1978 in Chicago, Illinois.

==History==

The &quot;Daily News&quot; was founded by Melville E. Stone, Percy Meggy, and William Dougherty in 1875 and began publishing on December 23. Byron Andrews, fresh out of Hobart College, was one of the first reporters. The paper aimed for a mass readership in contrast to its primary competitor, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which appealed to the city&#x27;s elites. The &quot;Daily News&quot; was Chicago&#x27;s first penny paper, and the city&#x27;s most widely read newspaper in the late nineteenth century. Victor Lawson bought the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1876 and became its business manager. Stone remained involved as an editor and later bought back an ownership stake, but Lawson took over full ownership again in 1888.

===Independent newspaper===
During his long tenure at the &quot;Daily News&quot;, Victor Lawson pioneered many areas of reporting, opening one of the first foreign bureaus among U.S. newspapers in 1898. In 1912, the &quot;Daily News&quot; became one of a cooperative of four newspapers, including the &quot;New York Globe&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;, to form the Associated Newspapers syndicate. In 1922, Lawson started one of the first columns devoted to radio. He also introduced many innovations to business operations including advances in newspaper promotion, classified advertising, and syndication of news stories, serials, and comics. 
Victor Lawson died in August 1925, leaving no instructions in his will regarding the disposition of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Walter A. Strong, who was Lawson&#x27;s business manager, spent the rest of the year raising the capital he needed to buy the &quot;Daily News&quot;. The Chicago Daily News Corporation, of which Strong was the major stockholder, bought the newspaper for $ (equivalent to $ in )the highest price paid for a newspaper up to that time. Strong was the president and publisher of the Chicago Daily News Corporation from December 1925 until his death in May 1931.

As Lawson&#x27;s business manager, Strong partnered with the Fair Department Store to create a new radio station. Strong asked Judith C. Waller to run the new station. When Waller protested that she didn&#x27;t know anything about running a station. Strong replied &quot;neither do I, but come down and we&#x27;ll find out.&quot; Waller was hired in February 1922 and went on to have a long and distinguished career in broadcasting. What would become WMAQ had its inaugural broadcast April 12, 1922.

That same year, the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; began to experiment with radio news at Westinghouse-owned KYW. In 1924 the &quot;Tribune&quot; briefly took over station WJAZ, changing its call letters to WGN, then purchased station WDAP outright and permanently transferred the WGN call letters to this second station.

The &quot;Daily News&quot; would eventually take full ownership of the station and absorb shared band rival WQJ, which was jointly owned by the Calumet Baking Powder Company and the Rainbo Gardens ballroom. WMAQ would pioneer many firsts in radio—one of them the first complete Chicago Cubs season broadcast on radio in 1925, hosted by sportswriter-turned-sportscaster Hal Totten. In April 1930, WMAQ was organized as a subsidiary corporation with Walter Strong as its chairman of the board, and Judith Waller as vice president and station manager.

On August 2, 1929, it was announced that the &quot;Chicago Daily Journal&quot; was consolidating with the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and the &quot;Journal&quot; published its final issue on August 21.

By the late 1920s, it was apparent to Walter Strong that his newspaper and broadcast operations needed more space. He acquired the air rights over the railroad tracks that ran along the west side of the Chicago River. He commissioned architects Holabird &amp; Root to design a modern building over the tracks that would have newspaper production facilities and radio studios. The 26-floor Chicago Daily News Building opened in 1929. It featured a large plaza with a fountain dedicated to Strong&#x27;s mentor, Victor Lawson, and a mural by John W. Norton depicting the newspaper production process. The Art Deco structure became a Chicago landmark, and stands today under the name Riverside Plaza.

In 1930, the radio station obtained a license for an experimental television station, W9XAP, but had already begun transmitting from it just prior to its being granted. Working with Sears Roebuck stores by providing them with the receivers, those present at the stores were able to see Bill Hay, (the announcer for &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;), present a variety show from the Daily News Building, on August 27, 1930. Ulises Armand Sanabria was the television pioneer behind this and other early Chicago television experiments. In 1931 &quot;The Daily News&quot; sold WMAQ to NBC.

In its heyday as an independent newspaper from the 1930s to 1950s the &quot;Daily News&quot; was widely syndicated and boasted a first-class foreign news service. It became known for its distinctive, aggressive writing style which 1920s editor Henry Justin Smith likened to a daily novel. This style became the hallmark of the newspaper: &quot;For generations&quot;, as Wayne Klatt puts it in &quot;Chicago Journalism: A History&quot;, &quot;newspeople had been encouraged to write on the order of Charles Dickens, but the Daily News was instructing its staff to present facts in cogent short paragraphs, which forced rivals to do the same.&quot; In the 1950s, city editor Clement Quirk Lane (whose son John would become Walter Cronkite&#x27;s executive producer) issued a memo to the staff that has become something of a memorial of the paper&#x27;s house style, a copy of which can be found on Lane&#x27;s entry.

===Knight Newspapers and Field Enterprises===

After a long period of ownership by Knight Newspapers (later Knight Ridder), the paper was acquired in 1959 by Field Enterprises, owned by heirs of the former owner of the Marshall Field and Company department store chain. Field already owned the morning &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and the &quot;Daily News&quot; moved into the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;″ building on North Wabash Avenue. A few years later Mike Royko became the paper&#x27;s lead columnist, and quickly rose to local and national prominence. However, the Field years were mostly a period of decline for the newspaper, partly due to management decisions but also due to demographic changes; the circulation of afternoon dailies generally declined with the rise of television, and downtown newspapers suffered as readers moved to the suburbs.

In 1977 the &quot;Daily News&quot; was redesigned and added features intended to increase its appeal to younger readers, but the changes did not reverse the paper&#x27;s continuing decline in circulation. The &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; published its last edition on Saturday, March 4, 1978.

As reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, later in 1978, Lloyd H Weston, president, editor and publisher of Addison Leader Newspapers, Inc., a group of weekly tabloids in the west and northwest suburbs—obtained rights to the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; trademark. Under a new corporation, CDN Publishing Co., Inc., based in DuPage County, Weston published a number of special editions of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, including one celebrating the Chicago Auto Show.

The following year, a Rosemont-based group headed by former Illinois governor Richard B. Ogilvie contracted to purchase CDN Publishing, with the expressed intention of publishing the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; as a weekend edition beginning that August. Weston hosted a party celebrating the signing of the contract with Ogilvie at the iconic Pump Room in the Ambassador Chicago Hotel. The gala was attended by hundreds of the city&#x27;s well-known names in politics, publishing, broadcasting and advertising.

The next day, Ogilvie reneged on the deal. The check he signed as payment to Weston bounced and his corporation filed for federal bankruptcy protection.

Weston&#x27;s last edition of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; featured extensive photo coverage of the October 4, 1979, visit to Chicago of Pope John Paul II.

In 1984, Weston sold his rights to the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; trademark to Rupert Murdoch, who, at the time, was owner and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

The headquarters of the &quot;Daily News&quot; and &quot;Sun-Times&quot; was located at 401 North Wabash before the building was demolished. It is now the site of Trump International Hotel and Tower.
