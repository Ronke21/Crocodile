<text>The Waynflete Professorships are four professorial fellowships at the University of Oxford endowed by Magdalen College and named in honour of the college founder William of Waynflete, who had a great interest in science. These professorships are statutory professorships of the University, that is, they are professorships established in the university&#x27;s regulations, and which are by those regulations attached to Magdalen College in particular. The oldest professorship is the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy. The three science professorships were created following the recommendation of the University Commission in 1857, in recognition of William of Waynflete&#x27;s lifetime support of science. The professorships are the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry, the Waynflete Professor of Physiology, and the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics.

==Waynflete Professors of Metaphysical Philosophy==
This Waynflete Professorship is one of five statutory professorships in philosophy at the University of Oxford, the other four being the Wykeham Professorship in Logic, the White’s Professorship of Moral Philosophy, the Wilde Professor of Mental Philosophy, as well as the untitled professorship in Ancient Philosophy.

<doc id="1149896" wikidata="Q2836728" url="?curid=1149896" title="Square Deal">
<text>The Square Deal was Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic program, which reflected his three major goals: conservation of natural resources, corporate law, and consumer protection.

These three demands are often referred to as the &quot;three C&#x27;s&quot; of Roosevelt&#x27;s Square Deal. Thus, it aimed at helping middle-class citizens and involved attacking plutocracy and bad trusts while at the same time protecting business from the most extreme demands of organized labor. He explained in 1901–1909:
When I say that I am for the square deal, I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game, but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.

A Progressive Era Republican, Roosevelt believed in government action to mitigate social evils, and as president he in 1908 denounced &quot;the representatives of predatory wealth&quot; as guilty of &quot;all forms of iniquity from the oppression of wage workers to unfair and unwholesome methods of crushing competition, and to defrauding the public by stock-jobbing and the manipulation of securities.&quot;

During his second term, Roosevelt tried to extend his Square Deal further, but was blocked by conservative Republicans in Congress.

== History ==

=== Coining of the term ===
The press was using the term &quot;Square Deal&quot; as early as 1871 in a &quot;New York Times&quot; local news article that reads &quot;Many of the inscriptions on the front of trucks, drays, and other vehicles are quite amusing. On one there is a picture of a hand containing four aces, and over it is inscribed square deal.&quot; In 1888, in &quot;letters from the people&quot; (letters to the editor), one writer signed off as &quot;Square Deal&quot;. In 1890, the phrase started to appear in headlines, e.g., &quot;Give China a Square Deal&quot; and &quot;Not a Square Deal&quot;.

An early usage of &quot;square deal&quot; by Theodore Roosevelt in the press occurred in 1899, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted his saying, &quot;I did not appoint a man because he came from Dr. Wall&#x27;s or any other church; I gave each man a square deal on his own account. That is what I mean by .&quot;

In 1901, he declared &quot;a square deal for every man, big or small, rich or poor&quot; during a speech in Lynn, Massachusetts, recorded by stereograph (photo) image.

In a 1903 speech in Springfield, Illinois, he stated, &quot;It seems to me eminently fitting that the guard around the tomb of Lincoln should be composed of colored soldiers. It was my own good fortune at Santiago to serve beside colored troops. A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.&quot;

In October 1904, while Roosevelt was readying publication of his book &quot;A Square Deal for Every Man&quot; (Chicago, R. J. Thompson, 1905), &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:

The 94-page pamphlet&#x27;s 75 topics include: America, A Good American, Alaska, Anarchy, Army and Navy, Capital, Character, Charity, Citizenship, Farmer, Peace, Publicity, Trusts, Weaklings, and World Power. Some imitate the form of proverbs. During 1905, Roosevelt capitalized on his slogan in the newspapers, who added &quot;square deal&quot; to headlines:

* &quot;A &#x27;Square Deal&#x27; for the Negro&quot; (January 17) about &quot;negro suffrage&quot;
* &quot;A Square Deal for the South&quot; (January 27)
* &quot;Talks of Square Deal: President&#x27;s Address at Press Club Banquet&quot; (February 14)
* &quot;Upholds the President: Mormons Know He Will Give Them a Square Deal&quot; (April 10)
* &quot;The &#x27;Square Deal&#x27; Defined: President Offers Some Explanations of the Meaning of the Term&quot; (April 15)
* &quot;The Square Deal&quot; (May 18)

The press praised Roosevelt&#x27;s Square Deal:

The press also criticized him for it:

Other politicians tried to capitalize on the phrase, too, e.g., U.S. Representative Henry Sherman Boutell of Illinois.

=== Initial legislation ===

In 1903, with Roosevelt&#x27;s support, Congress passed the Elkins Act. This stated that railroads were not allowed to give rebates to favored companies any longer. These rebates had treated small Midwestern farmers unfairly by not allowing them equal access to the services of the railroad. The Interstate Commerce Commission controlled the prices that railroads could charge.

Legislation was passed which specified that meat had to be processed safely with proper sanitation. Foodstuffs and drugs could no longer be mislabeled, nor could consumers be deliberately misled.

Roosevelt gave high priority to environmental conservation, and safeguarded millions of acres of wilderness from commercial exploitation. Roosevelt&#x27;s conservation efforts were driven by practicality as well as by a love for nature. Influenced by early wise-use advocates like Gifford Pinchot, Roosevelt believed that nature existed to benefit humanity. In a conserved wilderness, water could be taken to irrigate farmland, sport could be had, and timber could be harvested.

Acting on these beliefs, Roosevelt set up the federal Reclamation Service in 1902. The agency, through the use of dams and irrigation, created arable land in areas that had been too dry to farm, and the Reclamation Service eventually brought millions of acres of farmland into service. During Roosevelt&#x27;s time in office, 24 reclamation projects were set up, and 150 national forests were created.

=== Second term ===

Roosevelt, moving to the left of his Republican Party base, called for a series of reforms that were mostly not passed. He sought a national incorporation law. All corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state. He called for a federal income tax, but the Supreme Court had ruled in 1895 that any income tax would require a constitutional amendment. Roosevelt sought an inheritance tax so the great family fortunes could not be inherited without the tax for generations.

In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes. Injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries, pre-empting state laws. He called for an eight-hour law for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a postal savings system to provide competition to local banks, and, finally, campaign finance reform.

He secured passage of the Hepburn Act in 1906, which increased the regulating power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Eventually, many of the proposals he championed were enacted under Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When Roosevelt ran for president on an independent Progressive Party ticket in 1912, in addition to these policies he proposed stringent new controls on the court system, especially state courts, to make them more democratic. His court policies in particular caused his anointed successor, William Howard Taft, to lead a counter-crusade which defeated Roosevelt in the Republican presidential primaries in 1912.

== Impact ==

=== Labor ===

Labor unions in the age of Samuel Gompers were generally on the Democratic side, but Roosevelt felt that favorable policies toward them would gain votes or at least neutralize their opposition. He had opposed unions in 1896, when they supported William Jennings Bryan, then came to appreciate their value after 1900. He played a central role in negotiating a compromise to end the Coal strike of 1902, which was threatening the nation&#x27;s energy supply. He decided they also needed a square deal, and a stronger voice and collective bargaining with corporations.

<text>Winnipeg—Birds Hill was a federal electoral district in Manitoba, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1979 to 1988.

This riding was created in 1976 from parts of Selkirk and St. Boniface ridings. It was contested at federal elections in 1979, 1980, and 1984. For its entire history, its Member of Parliament was New Democrat Bill Blaikie.

Boundary redistribution in 1987 abolished Winnipeg—Birds Hill. Its territory outside the city of Winnipeg plus the North Kildonan area was reassigned to Selkirk (later Selkirk—Red River), while the rest of its urban territory went to Winnipeg Transcona. Blaikie continued to serve as MP for Winnipeg Transcona under that name, and later the name of Elmwood—Transcona, from the 1988 federal election until he retired from Parliament in 2008.

<doc id="1149900" wikidata="Q126412" url="?curid=1149900" title="Massachusetts General Hospital">
<text>Massachusetts General Hospital (Mass General or MGH) is a teaching hospital located in the West End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is the original and largest clinical education and research facility of Harvard Medical School/Harvard University, and houses the world&#x27;s largest hospital-based research program with an annual research budget of more than $1.2 billion in 2021. It is the third-oldest general hospital in the United States with a patient capacity of 999 beds. Along with Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, Mass General is a founding member of Mass General Brigham, formerly known as Partners HealthCare, the largest healthcare provider in Massachusetts.

==History==
Founded in 1811, the original hospital was designed by the famous American architect Charles Bulfinch. It is the third-oldest general hospital in the United States; only Pennsylvania Hospital (1751) and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital&#x27;s predecessor New York Hospital (1771) are older. John Warren, Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at Harvard Medical School, spearheaded the move of the medical school to Boston. Warren&#x27;s son, John Collins Warren, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School, along with James Jackson, led the efforts to start the Massachusetts General Hospital, which was initially proposed in 1810 by Rev. John Bartlett, the Chaplain of the Almshouse in Boston. Because all those who had sufficient money were cared for at home, Massachusetts General Hospital, like most hospitals that were founded in the 19th century, was intended to care for the poor. A 30-year-old sailor was the first patient admitted to the hospital on September 3, 1821. During the mid-to-late 19th century, Harvard Medical School was located adjacent to Massachusetts General Hospital.

Walter J. Dodd established the radiology department at the hospital. From just after the discovery of x-rays in 1895, until his early death in 1916 from metastatic cancer caused by multiple radiation cancers he oversaw the radiology department. He also underwent over 50 surgical procedures at the hospital to treat his radiation injuries, from skin grafts to amputations.

The first American hospital social workers were based in the hospital.

The hospital&#x27;s work with developing specialized computer software systems for medical use in the 1960s led to the development of the MUMPS programming language, which stands for &quot;Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System&quot;, an important programming language and database system heavily used in medical applications such as patient records and billing. A major patient database system called File Manager, which was developed by the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs), was created using this language.

===Early use of anesthesia===

It was in the Ether Dome of MGH in , that a local dentist, William Thomas Green Morton, was invited to perform a public demonstration of the administration of inhaled ether to produce insensibility to pain during surgery. Several years prior, Dr. Crawford Long of Danielsville, Georgia had given ether for surgery, but his work was unknown outside Georgia until he published his experience in 1849. On 16 October 1846, after administration of ether by Morton, MGH Chief of Surgery, John Collins Warren, painlessly removed a tumor from the neck of a local printer, Edward Gilbert Abbott. Upon completion of the procedure, which was without screaming or restraint, the usually skeptical Warren reportedly quipped, &quot;Gentlemen, this is no humbug.&quot; News of this &quot;anesthesia&quot; invention rapidly traveled within months around the world.

A reenactment of the Ether Dome event was painted in 2000 by artists Warren and Lucia Prosperi. They used the then-MGH staff to pose as their counterparts from 1846. The Ether Dome still exists and is open to the public.

An anesthesia department was established at the MGH in 1936 under the leadership of Henry Knowles Beecher.

=== First successful replantation of a severed limb ===
On 23 May 1962, under the direction of Ronald A. Malt, a team of surgeons successfully accomplished the first replantation of completely severed limb.

While attempting to hitch a ride on the back of a freight train, Everett Knowles 1950-2016 age 12 hit an abutment when the train lurched, severing his arm completely at the shoulder. He and his arm were rushed to MGH, where a 30 year old Malt conducted the team of surgeons. Some doctors prepared Everett for surgery, while others worked on the separated arm. First, they rejoined the &quot;chaotically mangled blood vessels, then the bone and finally the skin&quot;. In the time since the accident, the arm had grown a &quot;deathly gray&quot;, but grew steadily pink as the surgery progressed and blood vessels were reattached. The nerves would be reconnected in a later surgery.

&quot;All we did,&quot; said the modest Dr. Malt, &quot;was apply techniques we&#x27;ve known about for a long time and simply never had occasion to correlate before...The astonishing thing was not the newness of the operation but the teamwork—the way 12 doctors with expert skills, distinguished a collection of authorities as you could find anywhere, were willing to stand by and feed the incomparable extent of their knowledge to me, for no gain other than to know they had contributed.&quot;

In , MGH received a $200 million gift from Cambridge entrepreneur Phillip &quot;Terry&quot; Ragon to endow a permanent vaccine research center. This gift is the largest in the hospital&#x27;s history and is addition to the $100 million gift he previously gave the hospital. The center is currently testing an HIV vaccine in South Africa.

==Facilities and current operations==
The main MGH campus is located at 55 Fruit Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It has expanded into an area formerly known as the West End, adjacent to the Charles River and Beacon Hill. The hospital handles around 1.5 million outpatient visits each year at its main campus, as well as its seven satellite facilities in Boston at Back Bay, Charlestown, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Waltham and Danvers. With more than 25,000 employees, the hospital is the largest non-governmental employer in Boston.

The hospital has 1,011 beds and admits around 50,000 patients each year. The surgical staff performs over 34,000 operations yearly. The obstetrics service handles over 3,800 births each year. The Massachusetts General Hospital Trauma Center is the oldest and largest American College of Surgeons-verified Level One Trauma Center in New England, evaluating and treating over 2,600 trauma patients per year. Architect Hisham N. Ashkouri, working in conjunction with Hoskins Scott Taylor and Partners, provided the space designs and schematics for the pediatrics, neonatal intensive care, and in-patient related floors, as well as the third-floor surgical suites and support facilities. In the fall of 2004, the Yawkey Center for Outpatient Care (named for Jean R. Yawkey) opened. This ten-floor facility is the largest and most comprehensive outpatient building in New England. In 2011, the Lunder Building, a , 14-floor building opened. The building houses three floors of operating rooms, an expanded emergency room, radiation oncology suites, inpatient neurology and neurosurgery floors, and inpatient oncology floors; all of which increase the inpatient capacity by 150 beds.

In 2022, the state approved a more than $2 billion expansion proposal from MGB, which included a $1.9 billion expansion of MGH with a new clinical building on Cambridge Street. This building will house 482 inpatient beds. After utilizing many of these beds to convert other parts of the hospital from 2-bed to 1-bed rooms, the hospital will net 94 new inpatient beds. The project is expected to be fully completed in 2030.

===Transportation===
The closest MBTA stop to the main campus is Charles/MGH on the Red Line. On March 27, 2007, the new Charles/MGH station was opened with new renovations, including handicap accessible elevators. There are five main food service areas for the general public on the MGH campus. They include the &quot;Eat Street Cafe&quot; in the lower level of the Ellison Building, the &quot;Blossom Street Cafe&quot; in the Cox lobby, &quot;Coffee Central&quot; in the White lobby, &quot;Tea Leaves and Coffee Beans&quot; in the Wang Ambulatory Care Center, and &quot;Coffee South&quot; in the Yawkey outpatient center.

== Massachusetts General Hospital for Children ==
Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (MGHfC) is a pediatric acute care children&#x27;s teaching hospital located in Boston, Massachusetts. The hospital has an estimated 100 pediatric beds and is affiliated the Harvard Medical School. The hospital is a member of Mass General Brigham and is the only children&#x27;s hospital in the network. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to patients aged 0–21 throughout Boston and the wider Massachusetts. Massachusetts General Hospital for Children also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. The hospital is directly attached to Massachusetts General Hospital and a Ronald McDonald House of New England family room is on site.

The hospital has an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level III neonatal intensive care unit that has a capacity of 18 bassinets. The hospital also has a 14-bed pediatric intensive care unit for critical pediatric patients age 0–21.

In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital converted their PICU into an adult ICU to help with the surge capacity for COVID-19. Patients that were in the PICU previously were transferred out to the Floating Hospital for Children and Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital for treatment.

=== Awards ===
As of 2021, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children has placed nationally in 5 ranked pediatric specialties on &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Mass General Cancer Center==
The Mass General Cancer Center is a center for cancer treatment within the broader Mass-General Hospital system, located at 55 Fruit Street in Boston, Massachusetts. It was formally established in 1989 as an independent aspect of the Mass-General Hospital system, and remains active today. 
The center was one of only 53 locations to receive the designation as a National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center.

As part of the Mass General Hospital System, the Cancer Center extends throughout New England and has several different community locations to receive treatment. It continues to expand, and in September 2023 recently received donations from philanthropists Jason and Keely Krantz to establish the Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research. This expansion is the largest individual donation in the 34-year history of the Center.

===Second opinions===
The hospital offers a global second opinion service in cooperation with Grand Rounds.

==Affiliated institutions==
Massachusetts General Hospital is affiliated with Harvard Medical School and is its original and largest teaching hospital. Together they form an academic health science center. In , the Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute of immunology was founded to bolster research into creating vaccines and other therapies for acquired immune system conditions, chiefly AIDS. It was made possible by a $100 million gift over ten years, and represents the largest single donation made to MGH.

The Recovery Research Institute was created in 2013 by John F. Kelly, the first endowed professor of Addiction Medicine at Harvard Medical School. The institute is a part of the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry and published the National Recovery Study, the first-ever nationally representative study on the number of Americans in recovery from alcohol or other drug use. The institute also created the Addictionary, the first-ever glossary of addiction-related terms and a system for stigmatized terminology alerts.

MGH is affiliated with the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute through Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care and the Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. They are also affiliated with Project Pinball Charity.

In 2012, MGH was named the number one hospital in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In 2011, MGH was named the second-best hospital in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. MGH consistently ranks as one of the country&#x27;s top hospitals in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2011, MGH was also ranked as one of the top three hospitals in the country for Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology; Ear, Nose &amp; Throat; Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery; Ophthalmology; Orthopedics; and Psychiatry.

In , &quot;Becker&#x27;s Hospital Review&quot; listed MGH as number 12 on the 100 &#x27;Top Grossing Hospitals&#x27; in America with $5.64 billion in gross revenue.

In 2003, MGH was named the state&#x27;s first Magnet hospital by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association. Magnet recognition represents the highest honor awarded for nursing excellence.

==Controversies==

In MGH received criticism from activists and legislators for their role in conducting a study of the use of amygdalotomy to reduce violence in individuals who received the procedure. This study came after significant pressure on medical practitioners to stop using invasive procedures to try to alter behavior of patients and was denounced as &quot;a new form of lobotomy&quot;. Although the study was ended before any surgery was conducted on incarcerated people, MGH was simultaneously criticized for conducting genetic and fingerprint studies of people incarcerated at MCI–Cedar Junction (known as MCI–Walpole at the time), Bridgewater State Hospital, and MCI–Framingham in an attempt to discover markers for &quot;criminal&quot; behavior. This discredited science is often associated with attempts at the time to pathologize and incarcerate black people as a response to the Black Liberation Movement.

In , a former MGH physician filed a lawsuit under seal alleging that at least five orthopedic surgeons endangered patient safety by keeping them under anesthesia longer than necessary while the surgeons performed simultaneous surgeries. That year, MGH fired Dr. Dennis Burke after he spoke to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; about the dual-booking practice. In 2019, MGH paid $13 million and agreed to improve safety practices, to settle Burke&#x27;s wrongful termination suit. Also in 2019, MGH paid $5.1 million to settle a medical malpractice lawsuit involving a concurrent surgery performed on former Boston Red Sox baseball team pitcher Bobby Jenks.

Dr. Lisa Wollman refiled her lawsuit in under the federal False Claims Act, citing concerns that the hospital was driven by economic benefit and keeping patients unaware of the practice of concurrent surgeries. Wollman&#x27;s attorney claimed that Medicare and Medicaid were being defrauded because they require that the surgeons must be present for all &quot;critical portions&quot; of the surgery in order to be compensated. MGH settled the lawsuit in 2022 for $14.9 million, including reimbursement for the disputed government payments, and agreed to get specific consent for the practice from patients.

In , approximately 10,000 patients participating in research studies at MGH, had their names, dates of birth, diagnoses, tests, medical record numbers, and medical histories exposed in a data breach by &quot;an unauthorized third party&quot;. The incident did not become public until .

<text>Geoarchaeology is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses the techniques and subject matter of geography, geology, geophysics and other Earth sciences to examine topics which inform archaeological and chronological knowledge and thought. Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect archaeological sites such as geomorphology, the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and artifacts post-deposition. 

Geoarchaeologists&#x27; work frequently involves studying soil and sediments as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, geographic information systems (GIS) and digital elevation models (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences. Geoarchaeology is important to society because it informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediment, and rocks on the buried sites and artifacts they are researching. By doing this, scientists are able to locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how &quot;prehistoric&quot; they really are. Geoarchaeology is considered a sub-field of environmental archaeology because soil can be altered by human behavior, which archaeologists are then able to study and reconstruct past landscapes and conditions.

==Techniques used==

===Column sampling===
Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a section for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions.

===Loss on ignition testing===
Loss on ignition testing for soil organic content – a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil&#x27;s horizons may not be visible in section and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an area&#x27;s potential for prehistoric surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.

=== Near-surface geophysical prospection ===
Geophysical archaeological prospection methods are used to non-destructively explore and investigate possible structures of archaeological interest buried in the subsurface. Commonly used methods are:

* magnetometry
* ground-penetrating radar
* earth resistance measurements
* electromagnetic induction measurements (including metal detection and magnetic susceptibility surveys)
* sonar (sidescan, single-beam or multibeam sonar, sediment sonar) in underwater archaeology

Less commonly used geophysical archaeological prospection methods are:

* reflection or refraction seismic measurements
* gravity measurements
* thermography

===Magnetic susceptibility analysis===
The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghemite; just because THE soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:
* Site prospection, which identifies areas of archaeological potential before excavation.
* Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits.
* Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging).

The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:
* Identify buried soils in depositional sequences.
* Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments, etc.

===Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry===
Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish, and bones. One hundred people excrete about 62 kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650 g of (500 g–80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and &#x27;fixed&#x27;, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site, this corresponds to about 150 kg ha-1yr-1, about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences in the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different &#x27;pools&#x27; in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.

Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the process of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the &#x27;molybdate blue&#x27; reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks compared to a colour chart.

Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas and are also used to prospect for sites on the broader landscape.

===Particle size analysis===
The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated using dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, gravel and sands, sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodium pyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, clays). A rotating clock glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp helps separate particles.

The results are plotted on curves that can be analyzed using statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.

The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils, and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is the first step in handling these samples.

===Trace element geochemistry===
Trace element geochemistry studies the abundance of elements in geological materials that do not occur in large quantities in these materials. Because these trace elements&#x27; concentrations are determined by many situations under which a specific geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations containing the same type of rock or other geological material.

Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts to &quot;fingerprint&quot; them. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.

===Clay mineralogy analysis===
Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots and, through this, to know which production centers likely made them. They can also use mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.

===Ostracod analysis===
Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns shows the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities. This record can be correlated with age-dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.

==Archaeological geology==

Archaeological geology is a term coined by Werner Kasig in 1980. It is a sub-field of geology which emphasises the value of earth constituents for human life.

<text>Donald Eugene Liddle (May 25, 1925 – June 5, 2000) was an American left-handed pitcher in professional baseball who played four seasons in the Major Leagues for the Milwaukee Braves, New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals from 1953 through 1956. Born in Mount Carmel, Illinois, he batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .

Liddle is most remembered as the man who, in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, threw the pitch to Vic Wertz that resulted in The Catch — Giant center fielder Willie Mays&#x27; historic back-to-home-plate, over-the-shoulder grab of Wertz&#x27; long drive with two men on base in the deepest part of center field at the Giants&#x27; home field, the Polo Grounds. Had the ball fallen safely, the opposition Cleveland Indians would have taken the lead 4–2 late in the game. But Mays&#x27; catch preserved a 2–2 tie, the Giants won the game in extra innings, and swept the Series in four straight contests.

Wertz was the only batter Liddle faced that day. Reportedly, he commented after the game was over in the locker room, &quot;Well, I got my man&quot;, joking about his good fortune and Mays&#x27; athletic performance. Liddle later started and won the decisive Game 4 in Cleveland, pitching 6 innings and giving up only one earned run.

Earlier in 1954, Liddle was part of a pivotal, five-player trade, coming to the Giants with fellow left-handed pitcher Johnny Antonelli from the Braves in exchange for 1951 playoff hero Bobby Thomson. Antonelli won 21 games for the 1954 Giants, leading them to the National League pennant, and topped the Senior Circuit in earned run average.

Liddle appeared in 117 Major League games played, 54 as a starting pitcher. In 427 innings, he gave up 397 hits and 203 bases on balls, striking out 198. He retired from baseball after the 1957 season, which he spent in minor league baseball.

Liddle died, aged 75, in his hometown of Mount Carmel, Illinois.

<text>The Swedish Grand Prix () was a round of the Formula One World Championship from 1973 to 1978. It took place at the Scandinavian Raceway in Anderstorp (Gislaved Municipality), about from Jönköping, in Småland, Sweden. The first race to hold the title of Grand Prix in Sweden was the Swedish Winter Grand Prix, an ice race similar to races held in Estonia, Finland and Norway. The first Swedish Summer Grand Prix was held in 1933, but was not repeated until 1949.

The first races with the title Swedish Grand Prix were three sports car races held at Råbelövsbanan starting in 1955. A Formula Two race held in 1967 also carried the title.

==History==

===Origins===
While racing in Sweden had a long history it was not until 1931 that a race was first titled Grand Prix. The first Swedish Winter Grand Prix was held on a mammoth 46 kilometre circuit near Lake Rämen about 2 hours northwest of Stockholm in the snow and freezing cold with a lap time of approximately 35 minutes. In 1933 the first Swedish Summer Grand Prix was held on another huge 30 kilometre circuit made of public roads at Norra Vram, not far north from Malmö, a race which can be better compared to modern Grands Prix. The opening lap saw a multi-car pile-up which saw several drivers injured, two seriously, and a riding mechanic was killed. One of the crashed cars started a fire which saw a nearby house burned to the ground. The race continued while emergency services attended the scene and the race was eventually won by Antonio Brivio in an Alfa Romeo (for &quot;Scuderia&quot; Ferrari). Major racing came to a halt after that.

===Kristianstad===

The first postwar &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (a sports car event) was held in August 1955, only a few months after the Le Mans tragedy. 75,000 spectators surrounded the -long Råbelövsbanan circuit, located near Kristianstad. It was the debut of the Mercedes 300SLR (entered for Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss). Other entrants included Peter Collins and Roy Salvadori (the works Aston Martin DB3Ss), Eugenio Castellotti (the sole works Ferrari 735 LM), and the works Maserati 300S of Jean Behra.

Unusually, the race used a Le Mans start. It proved to be &quot;a dull procession&quot;, with Moss leading lap one, while Fangio took command on lap two and held the lead for the next 31 laps to the checkered flag. Only Fangio, Moss, Castellotti (who came third), and Behra finished.

After the track was resurfaced and widened, following it being named an event on the World Sportscar Championship calendar, in 1956, another event was held. It drew a larger field, including works Ferrari and Maserati teams and &quot;Ecurie Ecosse&quot;″s Le Mans-winning D-types, and ran 153 laps.

Collins took an early lead in the Ferrari 290 MM, pursued by Moss&#x27; 300S and Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s Ferrari 860 Monza. At the first pit stop, Moss came out first. Behra (sharing Moss&#x27; 300S) suffered brake trouble and Olivier Gendebien (in Collins&#x27; Ferrari) had an oil leak. The oil led to a wreck involving Gendebien&#x27;s teammates Collins (taking over for Wolfgang von Trips) and Phil Hill (in the car started by Maurice Trintignant). This put the Ferrari shared between Castellotti and Fangio well ahead. Moss took over the Maserati of Luigi Villoresi and Harry Schell, only for it to have trouble with its brakes, as well. The car Moss started caught fire in a pit stop debacle. Castellotti&#x27;s engine blew in the lead, giving the Trintignant/Hill 250MM the win, followed home by von Trips/Collins in the second 250MM, and Hawthorne/Alfonso de Portago/Duncan Hamilton in an 860 Monza.

The last sports car &quot;Grand Prix&quot; at Råbelövsbanan was in 1957, a six-hour World Sportscar Championship race, rather than . It was dominated by the Maserati 450S shared by Moss and Behra, which &quot;romped home&quot; in front of the Ferrari 335 S of Hill and Collins. In addition, Moss co-drove the 300S of Jo Bonnier/Giorgio Scarlatti/Harry Schell, which came third. Hawthorne and Luigi Musso placed fourth in a 335 S.

===Karlskoga===
In 1967, the name Swedish Grand Prix was, as a one-off name, given to that year&#x27;s Kanonloppet in Karlskoga. It was run to Formula Two rules and was won by Jackie Stewart.

===Anderstorp===
Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s success with Team Lotus was the catalyst for a Swedish Grand Prix and the race was held for the first time in 1973 at the grandly-named Scandinavian Raceway, about two hours east of Gothenburg in the middle of southern Sweden- this circuit, much like Watkins Glen in the eastern United States, was very isolated and people often either camped out or stayed in local people&#x27;s homes, which were few and far between in the nearmost town of Anderstorp, a town with a population of less than 5,000; the larger town of Gislaved not providing much more accommodation. Peterson did not disappoint his fans in qualifying, taking pole in his Lotus. For 70 laps it looked like this was going to be a one-two for Team Lotus with Peterson first and world champion Emerson Fittipaldi second. However disaster struck when Fittipaldi retired with gearbox failure. Meanwhile, Denny Hulme was quickly closing the gap on the lead, Peterson having major trouble with tire wear and fighting to stay on the track. On the 79th, penultimate, lap Hulme was able to pass the local hero to snatch victory, the New Zealander&#x27;s decision to run harder tires on his McLaren-Cosworth having paid off. Peterson was second. That was as close as any Swede came to winning on home soil. During the 1973 season, the Cosworth DFV powered the winner in every single race in the 15-race season, a performance never repeated.

In 1974, the Swedish Grand Prix was totally dominated by the two Tyrrell 007-Cosworths of Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler. It was the Frenchman who took pole, however Scheckter beat him by 0.380 sec in the race. This was the South African&#x27;s first Grand Prix win.

In 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda&#x27;s second year with Ferrari, the team provided him with the 312T – a car that was technically far superior to any of the competition. He won his first world title that year with 5 wins and a huge margin over second place in the championship. At Anderstorp he took his third consecutive win of the season after the Monaco and Belgian Grands Prix. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Vittorio Brambilla in his March, Lauda qualified fifth fastest and his teammate Clay Regazzoni 11th. In the race Brambilla took the lead, but by lap 16 he was overtaken by Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Brabham. Meanwhile, Lauda was steadily progressing through the field and on lap 42 he was second. He put a series of fastest laps, closed on Reutemann and overtook him to win the Grand Prix by 6 seconds. Reutemann finished second with Regazzoni in the second Ferrari 312T third. The 1976 Swedish GP saw the first (and only) win of a 6-wheel car – the Tyrrell P34. The theory was that its four tiny front wheels would increase mechanical front-end grip – with more rubber on the road – and thus eliminate understeer while at the same time improve cornering and braking. When it was revealed it was the instant sensation of the 1976 season. The car was a photo opportunity on wheels – six of them, which was precisely why – and must have given Elf more free publicity in the 1976 pre-season and beyond than it garnered during the whole of 1974 and 1975. Tyrrell&#x27;s Jody Scheckter took pole, with Patrick Depailler in fourth. In the race the Tyrrells strode imperiously to a crushing one-two. The South African, who when later probed confided that he thought the six-wheeled concept ridiculous, was beaming on the podium. However the Swedish walkover proved to be a fluke, and the P34 never won a race again. At Anderstorp, Jacques Laffite in his Gitanes sponsored Ligier-Matra put in a commanding display, romping to victory in the 1977 Swedish GP. France had been put back on the map: that was the first time that a French car with a French engine, backed by a French company, and driven by a French driver had won a Grand Prix.

====1978 race and the Brabham &quot;fan car&quot;====
The 1978 Swedish GP saw the only appearance in Formula One of the Brabham BT46B. Designed by Brabham&#x27;s Gordon Murray, who was trying to eclipse Colin Chapman&#x27;s ground effect invention on the Lotus 79, the car featured a large fan pulling air from under the bottom of the car to create additional downforce. Its legality was soon protested, but it was allowed to race, Niki Lauda and John Watson qualifying 2nd and 3rd behind the Lotus 79 of Mario Andretti. Andretti eventually dropped out due to a broken valve, allowing Lauda into the lead. Once a back-marker dropped oil onto the track, the Brabham was in a race of its own, seemingly unaffected by the slippery surface. Lauda went on to win by 34.6 seconds. The &quot;fan car&quot; was later voluntarily withdrawn by Brabham, and never raced again. The car had, however, been deemed legal, allowing the win to stand, which also cost Arrows their chance of victory in their debut season.

There has been no Swedish Grand Prix since 1978. The deaths of both Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson that year contributed to the demise of this round of the world championship, as interest for Formula One in Sweden fell as a result. The race was scheduled for the 1979 season, but was cancelled before being run, due to lack of local sponsorships.

<text>Andrew Timothy Peterson (born June 6, 1947) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2007 representing the Greater Toronto Area riding of Mississauga South.

==Background==
Peterson has a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from the University of Western Ontario. He is a director of Northern Crown Capital, Inc. (a merchant banking firm) and has sat on the board of directors of Process Capital, Nordex Explosives and Oxygen and Prescott Paper Products, as well as the Mississauga Hospital Foundation.

Peterson is the brother of two prominent Liberal politicians: former Premier of Ontario David Peterson and former federal cabinet minister Jim Peterson. He was the last of the three brothers to enter political life.

==Politics==
Peterson was elected in the 2003 provincial election as a Liberal in the riding of Mississauga South. He beat incumbent Progressive Conservative Margaret Marland by 234 votes. The Liberals under Dalton McGuinty formed a majority government and Peterson was named parliamentary assistant to Jim Bradley, the Ontario Minister of Tourism and Recreation. In 2006 he was appointed as parliamentary assistant to George Smitherman, the Ontario Health and Long-Term Care.

On March 29, 2007, Peterson resigned from the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent. He felt the McGuinty was not paying enough attention to issues in his Mississauga riding. He stated that he would run as the PC candidate in the October 2007 election. Liberal party insiders claimed that Peterson was dissatisfied with not being given a cabinet position. Minister of Finance Greg Sorbara said, &quot;It&#x27;s just common knowledge around our caucus that Tim has been disappointed for quite some time about the role he had been assigned within our government.&quot; On June 6, 2007, he officially joined the PC caucus.

In June 2007, Peterson was acclaimed as the Ontario PC candidate for Mississauga South. However, his candidacy was not without controversy. The local riding association objected to the former Ontario Liberal member&#x27;s nomination. They unsuccessfully tried to stop it. Former Mississauga South PC MPP Margaret Marland called the process &quot;despicable&quot;.

In the 2007 provincial election for the riding of Mississauga South, Peterson ran as the Ontario PC candidate, but lost to Ontario Liberal challenger Charles Sousa.

==Later life==
In April 2010, Peterson became a member of an advisory board for Oakville-based Sarissa Resources Inc. The mineral resource firm ceased operations after 2015.

<text>Weight gain is an increase in body weight. This can involve an increase in muscle mass, fat deposits, excess fluids such as water or other factors. Weight gain can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

== Description ==
Weight gain occurs when more energy (as calories from food and beverage consumption) is gained than the energy expended by life activities, including normal physiological processes and physical exercise.

If enough weight is gained due to increased body fat deposits, one may become overweight or obese, generally defined as having more body fat (adipose tissue) than is considered good for health. The Body Mass Index (BMI) measures body weight in proportion to height and defines optimal, insufficient, and excessive weight based on the ratio.

Having excess adipose tissue (fat) is a common condition, especially where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary. Being overweight or having obesity may increase the risk of several diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers, and may lead to short- and long-term health problems during pregnancy. Rates of obesity worldwide tripled from 1975 to 2016 to involve some 1.8 billion people and 39% of the world adult population.

A commonly asserted &quot;rule&quot; (the Wishnofsky Rule, aka Wishnofsky&#x27;s Rule) for weight gain or loss, is based on the research of Max Wishnofsky (December 17, 1899 – August 2, 1965), a Russian-born physician who had a medical practice in Brooklyn, New York. The Wishnofsky Rule states that one pound of human fat tissue contains about 3,500 kilocalories (often simply called &quot;calories&quot; in the field of nutrition). Wishnofsky conducted a review of previous observations and experiments on weight loss and weight gain, and stated his conclusions in a paper he published in 1958. Thus, according to the Wishnofsky Rule, eating 500 fewer calories than one needs per day should result in a loss of about a pound per week. Similarly, for every 3500 calories consumed above the amount one needs, a pound will be gained.

Wishnofsky noted that previous research suggested that a pound of human adipose tissue is 87% fat, which equals 395 grams of fat. He further assumed that animal fat contains 9.5 calories per gram. Thus one pound of human fat tissue should contain 3750 calories. He then critically analyzed the relevant literature and applied a number of additional assumptions, including that the diet contains sufficient protein and that the person is in glycogen and nitrogen (protein) equilibrium, leading to most weight loss stemming from the catabolism of fat. He concluded that a 3500 calorie excess or deficit for a person meeting his assumptions, would lead to the gain or loss, respectively, of one pound of body weight. He noted that if the assumptions he made are not met, a deficit of 3500 calories would not necessarily equate to a pound of weight loss.

Wishnofsky did not take into account numerous aspects of human physiology and biochemistry which were unknown at the time. The claim has achieved the status of a rule of thumb and is repeated in numerous sources, used for diet planning by dietitians and misapplied at the population level as well.

== Causes ==
In regard to adipose tissue increases, a person generally gains weight by increasing food consumption, becoming physically inactive, or both. When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (when the body is in positive energy balance), the body can store the excess energy as fat. However, the physiology of weight gain and loss is complex involving numerous hormones, body systems and environmental factors. Other factors besides energy balance that may contribute to gaining weight include:

=== Social factors ===
A study, involving more than 12,000 people tracked over 32 years, found that social networks play a surprisingly powerful role in determining an individual&#x27;s chances of gaining weight, transmitting an increased risk of becoming obese from wives to husbands, from brothers to brothers and from friends to friends.
The human microbiota facilitates fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs, contributing to weight gain. A change in the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may determine host&#x27;s risk of obesity.

===Sleep and stress===
Lack of sufficient sleep has been suggested as a cause for weight gain or the difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight. Two hormones responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism are leptin, which inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, and ghrelin, which increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Studies have shown that chronic sleep deprivation is associated with reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin, which together result in increased appetite, especially for high fat and high carbohydrate foods. As a result, sleep deprivation over time may contribute to increased caloric intake and decreased self-control over food cravings, leading to weight gain.

===Hormone and neurotransmitter imbalances===
Weight gain is a common side-effect of certain psychiatric medications.

===Pathologies===
Pathological causes of weight gain include Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, hypothyroidism, insulinoma, and craniopharyngioma. Genetic reasons can relate to Prader–Willi syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Alström syndrome, Cohen syndrome, and Carpenter syndrome.

== Effects ==
Excess adipose tissue can lead to medical problems; however, a round or large figure does not necessarily imply a medical problem, and is sometimes not primarily caused by adipose tissue. If too much weight is gained, serious health side-effects may follow. A large number of medical conditions have been associated with obesity. Health consequences are categorised as being the result of either increased fat mass (osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, social stigma) or increased number of fat cells (diabetes, some forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
 There are alterations in the body&#x27;s response to insulin (insulin resistance), a proinflammatory state and an increased tendency to thrombosis (prothrombotic state).

<text>Mariel Leigh Zagunis (born March 3, 1985) is an American sabre fencer. She is a two-time Olympic champion in the individual sabre (2004 and 2008) and the first American woman to win a gold medal in fencing at the Olympics (which happened in 2004). She was Team USA flag bearer in the 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. She has two Olympic bronze team medals (in 2008 and 2016) and is a five-time Olympian (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020).

==Biography==
Zagunis&#x27; parents, Robert and Cathy (née Menges) Zagunis, were collegiate rowers at Oregon State University and Connecticut College, respectively. They both competed with the U.S. rowing team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Her older brother Marten and younger brother Merrick also fence sabre. She grew up in Oregon and attended Valley Catholic from kindergarten to 12th grade, and the University of Notre Dame where she majored in anthropology.

Zagunis is of Lithuanian descent on her paternal side and was raised in the Catholic faith.

==Early career==

Zagunis was the first American fencer to hold the Jr. World Cup Champion title (2002), and she did so three years in a row (2002, 2003, 2004). She is the youngest fencer ever to win the Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Escrime (FIE) World Championship gold, and the youngest fencer to win three FIE medals in one season. Zagunis won the FIE over-all medal three years in a row. She was the first fencer in the history of the sport to hold more than two World Champion titles in one season (2001: Cadet, Jr. and Jr. Team titles). She entered the University of Notre Dame in 2004 on an athletic scholarship.

In October 2005, Zagunis won her seventh World Champion title at the Leipzig, Germany World Championships, in the women&#x27;s team event. A year later at the 2006 World Fencing Championships she won the silver, after losing the final to Rebecca Ward. She is the second U.S. fencer in history to have won the World Cup total-points Title from the FIE.

In 2009 Zagunis captured the last individual World title to have eluded her when she won the World Championships in Antalya, Turkey, defeating Ukrainian Olga Kharlan 15–6 in the final. She repeated as World Champion one year later, again winning the individual sabre title, defeating the Ukraine&#x27;s Olga Khomrova 15–11 in the final.

==2004 Athens Olympics==

The Women&#x27;s Sabre event was being contested for the first time at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Zagunis did not directly qualify to fence in the tournament. However, Nigeria decided not to send their qualifying fencer to the tournament, and as the next highest seeded fencer in the world, Zagunis was selected to represent the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

She received one of eight byes offered in the first round, entering the tournament in the Round of 16, where she defeated Japanese fencer Madoka Hisagae, 15–13. In the quarterfinals, she defeated Elena Jemayeva of Azerbaijan, 15–11. In the semifinals, Zagunis clinched at least a silver medal by defeating Romania&#x27;s Cătălina Gheorghițoaia, 15–10.

Zagunis faced Chinese fencer Xue Tan in the finals, defeating her 15–9 and becoming the first American to win an Olympic fencing gold medal in 100 years. Previously the only American Olympic fencing gold medalist was Albertson Van Zo Post. In the 1904 Summer Olympics he had been the gold medalist in the individual singlestick event and in the team foil event, where he had joined two Cuban fencers to make up a combined Cuba/U.S. team.

Because fellow American Sada Jacobson had become the first U.S. woman to be ranked #1 in the world in women&#x27;s sabre (in 2003), she was considered a favorite. Zagunis&#x27; win as the underdog surprised the elite in the fencing world. (Jacobson earned the bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics.)

==2008 Beijing Olympics==

===Individual event===

Zagunis entered the 2008 Summer Olympics seeded sixth. She received a bye in the first round, entering the tournament when there were 32 fencers remaining. She trailed at the break in her round of 32 match against Sandra Sassine 8–7, but scored eight of the last ten touches to win 15–10. She then defeated Bogna Jozwiak 15–13 in the Round of 16.

She beat Bao Yingying in the quarterfinals, 15–9. Zagunis then faced her training partner from the Oregon Fencing Alliance, Rebecca Ward, in the semifinals and defeated her 15–11.

In the gold medal match, Zagunis faced the other top seed in the tournament, Sada Jacobson, and won, 15–8. With Ward&#x27;s victory in the bronze medal match, American fencers had won all three medals in the individual event for the first time in history.

===Team event===

In the women&#x27;s sabre team event, the U.S. was heavily favored to win. Zagunis teamed up with Jacobson and Ward to defeat the South African team in the quarterfinals, 45–8.

In the semifinals, they fenced the team from Ukraine. The Ukrainian side, seeded fifth in the tournament, defeated the U.S. team 45–39, denying them a gold medal, and placing them in the bronze medal bout against France. The U.S. team rebounded from their semifinal loss by defeating the French team 45–38 for the bronze medal.

==2012 London Olympics==

On July 25, 2012, Zagunis was elected by Team USA to be the national flag bearer in the Summer Olympics Parade of Nations.

Zagunis failed to win a medal at these games. She lost to South Korea&#x27;s Kim Ji-yeon, 15–13; then lost to Ukraine&#x27;s Olga Kharlan in the bronze medal match, 15–10.

==2020 Tokyo Olympics (in 2021)==
She was one of three female saber fencers to represent the United States in fencing at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo in 2021. Zagunis entered the 2021 Summer Olympics seeded tenth. She jumped out to a 7 to 0 lead in her round of 32 match against Canadian Gabriella Page (seeded 23) and scored the last five touches to win 15–3. She then defeated Korea&#x27;s Ji-yeon Kim (seeded 7) 15–12 in the Round of 16. In her quarterfinal match, she fell to two-time champion Sofya Velikaya (seeded 1) of the Russian Olympic Committee, 15–8, as the Russian reeled off 7 straight points to advance to the semifinals.

==Outside the fencing arena==
On March 3, 2017, Zagunis was announced as one of 16 celebrities participating in a cooking competition on the Food Network TV series &quot;Chopped&quot;. She was featured in the &quot;Star Power: Culinary Muscle&quot; episode, alongside former NFL player LaMarr Woodley, former gold medalist figure skater Dorothy Hamill, and current female UFC fighter Paige VanZant. Zagunis was the second contestant eliminated from the competition in her heat.

<doc id="1149938" wikidata="Q529912" url="?curid=1149938" title="Ken Foree">
<text>Ken Foree (born February 29, 1948) is an American actor, best known as the protagonist Peter from the horror film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978) and as Roger Rockmore on the Nickelodeon television sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; (1996–2000).

==Early life and career==
Foree was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. The oldest of four boys, he began acting in the 1970s, appearing in films such as &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;, &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. He also had roles in the films &quot;Knightriders&quot;, &quot;From Beyond&quot;, and &quot;The Dentist&quot;. In 1995, he starred in an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; as well as the &quot;GROPOS&quot; episode of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Foree also played Roger Rockmore, Kenan and Kyra&#x27;s father on the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;. In 2005, he played Charlie Altamont in the film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, starring opposite Sid Haig and Bill Moseley as the adopted brother of Haig&#x27;s character. In 2007, he appeared in Rob Zombie&#x27;s remake of the 1978 film &quot;Halloween&quot;.

Ken Foree appeared as himself in the 2008 novel &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by Jonathan Maberry.

Other celebrities include Tom Savini, Jim O&#x27;Rear, Brinke Stevens, James Gunn, Stephen Susco, Debbie Rochon, Joe Bob Briggs, and Mem Shannon.

The horror-comedy film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; contains a reference to Foree, as the film&#x27;s main character is an employee of Foree Electronics.

<text>Edward Korfanty (born 1952) is a Polish-born American fencing master, U.S. National Women&#x27;s saber coach, Olympic saber coach, and a former Men&#x27;s Veterans Saber World Champion.

==Fencing==
Korfanty was a member of the Polish national fencing team from 1972 to 1984. During his eight years on the Polish national team, he won numerous national and international medals and was a finalist at numerous World Cup and international competitions. He took second place individual three times in the Polish national championships and was team captain of the winning team four times. He was an alternate for one of the Olympic Games, but did not fence.

He became head coach at the Polish Olympic Center in Katowice in 1984. Korfanty moved to the University of Notre Dame in the U.S. in 1990 as assistant fencing coach, and also coached at the Indiana Fencing Academy until 1993. During his tenure at Notre Dame, he coached Canadian fencer Leszek Nowosielski (who was attending Notre Dame) to represent Canada at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.

He was appointed the US National Women&#x27;s saber coach, and coached the first US Women&#x27;s team (Mariel Zagunis, Christine Becker, Nicole Mustilli, and Sada Jacobson) to win the world championship in 2000. Under Korfanty&#x27;s direction in 2005, the US women&#x27;s saber team (Zagunis, Jacobson, Caitlin Thompson, and Rebecca Ward) won the gold medal at the world championships for the second time.

Ed Korfanty is also coach to Mariel Zagunis, who won the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens - the first American to win fencing gold in 100 years. In October 2003, as a member of the FIE ad hoc committee on saber fencing, Korfanty spearheaded the change with the International Fencing Federation (FIE) in the timing in which the lights for recording a touch fired. The change shortened the time in which the second light could fire (close out time) from 300 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds, 180 milliseconds faster than the previous rule. The change was implemented in October 2004, immediately following the Athens Olympics. Other notable students include Olympian Seth Kelsey, Christine Becker, Sara Borrmann (2008 NCAA Women&#x27;s Saber Champion), Valerie Providenza (2004 NCAA Women&#x27;s Saber Champion), Patrick Ghattas, Ian Farr, Caity Thompson, William Thanhouser, Lian Osier, and Diamond Wheeler.

In 2005 Korfanty&#x27;s students made up 75% of the U.S. Div. 1 National Women&#x27;s Saber Team (consisting of Zagunis, Ward, and Thompson - fourth team member Sada Jacobson is from another club). In 2006, student Rebecca Ward became the only fencer in history to win three World Cup titles in one season.

Korfanty continues to compete internationally as a member of the U.S. National Veterans team, and has been the 50-60 age group Men&#x27;s Saber World Champion three times (2002, 2003 and 2006). In 2004 and 2005 he won the silver medals at the Veterans World Championships.

Korfanty was named the U.S. Olympic Committee&#x27;s Coach of the Year in 2001, 2003, and 2004. In 2005, the U.S. Fencing Coaches Association presented Korfanty with the 2005 Outstanding Coach of the Year award for his outstanding results at the international level.

Korfanty formerly resided in Portland, Oregon, acting as the head coach of the Oregon Fencing Alliance and the U.S. Women&#x27;s National Saber Training Center. He currently resides in Laguna Hills, California, working as a coach at the Laguna Fencing Center.

==Education and training==
Ed Korfanty earned his fencing master diploma at the Academy of Physical Education in Katowice, Poland, under the tutelage of Zbigniew Czajkowski. He is also certified as a fencing master by the U.S. Fencing Coaches Association and the Academie d&#x27;Armes Internationale.

<doc id="1149943" wikidata="Q6244552" url="?curid=1149943" title="John Lennon's jukebox">
<text>John Lennon&#x27;s jukebox is a KB Discomatic jukebox made in the UK using a Swiss-made mechanism which Lennon bought in 1965. Lennon filled it with 40 singles to accompany him on tour. John Lennon&#x27;s Jukebox also refers to the compilation CD album closely based on the jukebox&#x27;s musical contents.

The jukebox surfaced in an auction of Beatles memorabilia at Christie&#x27;s and was sold for £2,500 ($4,907) to Bristol-based music promoter John Midwinter. Midwinter spent several years restoring the box and researching the discs, which had been catalogued in Lennon&#x27;s handwriting. As Midwinter&#x27;s health began to deteriorate, he became anxious that a story of the jukebox and its music should feature in a documentary. Eventually, &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; broadcast a documentary on the jukebox in 2004 in which many of the represented artists, along with Sting, were interviewed. The project (which was commissioned only a few days after Midwinter died) was developed by Steve Day for the British television production company Initial, headed by Malcolm Gerrie, and commissioned by Melvyn Bragg.

==Album==
The 2004 compilation album named &quot;John Lennon&#x27;s Jukebox&quot; contains 34 of the singles&#x27; A-sides and seven of their B-sides. The album contains several songs that are believed to be part of John Lennon&#x27;s original choice. The album is subtitled &quot;a collection inspired by music from his own collection&quot; and some of the songs on the album are different versions from the ones that could have been included in the jukebox. For instance, the version of &quot;Some Other Guy&quot; by The Big Three is not the one that was in the original jukebox; instead it is a mid-1970s recording by the same group in the style of the Richie Barrett original (including the use of an electric piano).

<text>Madison Starke Perry (1814 – March 1865) was the fourth Governor of Florida.

==Early life==
Madison Starke Perry was born in 1814, in Lancaster County, South Carolina, the youngest child of Benjamin Perry and his wife Mary Starke. He attended South Carolina College, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society.

He came to Florida in the 1830s and became a leader among the area&#x27;s plantation owners. He was elected in 1849 to represent the county in the Florida House of Representatives. The following year he was elected to the Florida Senate.

==Perry as governor==
Perry ran for and was elected governor in 1856, assuming office on October 5, 1857. As Florida&#x27;s fourth governor, Perry helped bring about the settlement of a long-standing boundary dispute with Georgia and encouraged the building of railways in the state. During the years before the Civil War, Governor Perry foresaw the possibility that Florida might secede from the Union, and in 1858 he urged the reestablishment of the state&#x27;s militia. Florida did secede three years later, on January 10, 1861. Perry then called for the evacuation of all federal troops from Florida, intending to replace them with the militia.

==Last years==
After his term as governor ended on October 7, 1861, Perry served as colonel of the 7th Florida Infantry Regiment until illness forced his resignation on April 30, 1863. He retired to his plantation in Rochelle, where he died in March 1865, aged 50 or 51, shortly before the end of the American Civil War. Survived by his wife and two children, he was buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Rochelle.

The city of Perry, Florida, is named in his honor. The city of Starke, Florida, may have been named in his honor.

<text>Elvis and Me: The True Story of the Love Between Priscilla Presley and the King of Rock N&#x27; Roll is a 1985 memoir written by Priscilla Presley, with Sandra Harmon. In the book, Priscilla talks about meeting Elvis Presley, their marriage, and the factors and issues that led to the couple&#x27;s divorce.

The book adaptation rights were purchased in 1987. In 1988, the book was adapted into the two-part ABC miniseries &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;, written by Joyce Eliason and directed by Larry Peerce; it stars Dale Midkiff as Elvis and Susan Walters as Priscilla. In 2023, a film adaptation, &quot;Priscilla&quot;, written and directed by Sofia Coppola, was released; Priscilla executive produced the film, and Cailee Spaeny stars in the title role, alongside Jacob Elordi as Elvis.

== Elements in the story ==

===Memphis: Elvis&#x27; family and Graceland===
Priscilla wrote that Elvis did not approve of his father’s relationship with divorcee Dee Stanley and did not attend their wedding. After the marriage, Elvis bought a home on Dolan Drive in Memphis, Tennessee, where his father, Vernon, and his new wife resided. On the rare occasions that Dee Stanley-Presley came to Graceland, Elvis did his best to be civil towards his stepmother.

Priscilla describes how her father reluctantly allowed her to live in Memphis, Tennessee to be near Elvis. The initial arrangement was that Priscilla would live with Vernon and Dee, while attending a Memphis Catholic school. Contrary to this arrangement, however, Priscilla gradually moved in with Elvis.

===The nights with Elvis===
Priscilla&#x27;s descriptions of the nights she spent with Elvis, before their marriage, suggest that the star was not overtly sexual towards her. The couple kissed and engaged in petting, but Elvis always stopped the make-out sessions, before it led to actual intercourse.

While describing a &quot;cleansing period&quot; in Elvis&#x27;s life, Priscilla claims that &quot;any sexual temptations were against everything he was striving for, and he did not wish to betray me, the girl waiting for him, at home, who was preparing to be his wife.&quot;

According to her account, Elvis told Priscilla that they had to wait until they were married, before having sex. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying we can&#x27;t do other things. It&#x27;s just the actual encounter. I want to save it.&quot; Priscilla adds, &quot;Fearful of not pleasing him—of destroying my image as his little girl—I resigned myself to the long wait. Instead of consummating our love in the usual way, he began teaching me other means of pleasing him. We had a strong connection, much of it sexual. The two of us created some exciting and wild times.&quot;

===Daily life with Elvis===
Priscilla notes that prescription drugs were present, from the first time she visited Elvis in America. He took placidyls, to get to sleep, in ever-increasing doses. Elvis would wake up at his normal time, which was around 4:00 in the afternoon, but for a few hours, he would be groggy and irritable, from the heavy dose of pills. He then began taking Dexedrine, in order to wake up.

Elvis liked old movie classics revolving around family or struggles to survive in the world. &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot;, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; and &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, the story of a self-sacrificing father, were among his favorites. 

Priscilla also describes several episodes involving Elvis&#x27; explosive temper and his jealous nature, including the time he went into a rage and threatened to fire a male employee (Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling), who, supposedly, acted too &quot;friendly&quot; with Priscilla.

===Affairs with other women===
Conversely, she writes about Presley&#x27;s double standard for his own behavior. His promiscuity with other women led to several confrontations. Priscilla says she was aware he had been dating Anita Wood, a girl from Memphis, Tennessee, when they first met in Germany and that he had continued the relationship for nearly two years, following his discharge from the Army. When he asked Priscilla to move to Memphis, Tennessee, he told her the relationship with Wood was over, but she describes, later, finding a packet of love letters from Wood in the attic at Graceland. However, according to Elvis&#x27;s own words, he did not make love to Anita Wood the whole four years he was with her. &quot;Just to a point,&quot; he said, &quot;then I stopped. It was difficult for her too, but that&#x27;s just how I feel.&quot;

Presley admitted he had a number of affairs with some of the women who co-starred in his films, but all the relationships were before he met Priscilla and &quot;meant nothing.&quot; Nevertheless, she understood these affairs were going on, while he was professing love to Anita Wood.

In a televised interview on January 14, 2005, with Larry King on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Anita Wood said that following media reports of a girlfriend in Germany, Elvis &quot;had me believing that she (Priscilla) was just a friend, that daddy was in the Army with him, and there was nothing to it, whatsoever.&quot;

Priscilla also writes of other times she became suspicious of Elvis&#x27; infidelity. One such time was when Elvis released &quot;(Marie&#x27;s the Name) His Latest Flame&quot;; Priscilla wondered, at that time, if Elvis was dating a girl named Marie.

===The Ann-Margret affair===
Of the many women involved with Elvis, the one whom Priscilla felt that her relationship with Elvis was most threatened by, was actress/singer Ann-Margret, who co-starred with Elvis in the film &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;. In her book, Priscilla devotes four pages to the subject (175 to 178). There was a lot of publicity about a romance between Elvis and Ann-Margret, during the 1963 filming and in the following weeks, when Elvis returned to record music and prepare for his next film. Despite his denials of an affair, Priscilla went to Los Angeles and stayed with him. Aware Priscilla was there, Ann-Margret took matters into her own hands and suddenly announced to the Los Angeles press that she was engaged to Elvis Presley. The news was picked up by every major newspaper in America, and Elvis informed Priscilla that he and Colonel Tom Parker thought it best for her to &quot;go back to Memphis, till it calms down.&quot; Outraged, Priscilla picked up a vase and hurled it across the room, screaming that Ann-Margret should &quot;keep her ass in Sweden, where she belongs.&quot; Desperate to please him, however, she went back to Graceland the next day. Elvis returned two weeks later, and admitted to the affair, but he promised it was over. Of all the movie stars Elvis Presley worked with, Ann-Margret was the only one to attend his funeral.

The very next line of Priscilla&#x27;s book says that after the Ann-Margret ordeal, she soon suspected there were other women. She began traveling with him, but says she would still &quot;get crazed with worry.&quot; She was afraid that the moment she was away from him, another woman could slip in. Priscilla relates how her insecurities would lead her to imitate the other woman&#x27;s appearance (changing her clothes, hairstyle, and makeup), to hopefully please him.

If she forcefully challenged Presley on her suspicions, he would threaten to send her home to her parents. One such confrontation (over Shelley Fabares, another Presley film co-star) led to a screaming match, where he told her to get out. With her bags packed and a chauffeur ready to take her to the airport, Elvis changed his mind, at the last minute, and she willingly stayed. (In the TV movie, the confrontation was portrayed over the Ann-Margret affair, not over Fabares, as written in the book).

Priscilla writes that it was years later before she realized his tactics were part of a need to control her. This pattern began, before they were married, but in her 2005 made-for-television documentary, titled &quot;Elvis by the Presleys&quot;, she admitted that during their marriage, he had affairs with other women. 

===The Beatles&#x27; shadow, mysticism, and drugs===
By 1965, the Beatles had overwhelmed the music industry, and Presley&#x27;s record sales declined noticeably. Uncertain about who he was and where his career was going, Elvis turned to spiritualism, dragging an uninterested Priscilla with him. He had not performed live for several years and labeled most of his movies a joke. By the time filming was to begin on &quot;Clambake&quot; (released 1967), Presley&#x27;s growing distress with the quality of his films led to a despondency, accompanied by overeating, and his normal 170 pound (77 kg) weight ballooned to 200 lb (91 kg). The movie studio ordered him to lose the weight quickly, marking the introduction of diet pills to the already excessive regimen of placidyls and Dexedrine, which would eventually kill him.

In his search for a &quot;higher state of consciousness,&quot; Presley became fascinated with the occult and metaphysical phenomena. During his spiritual quest, everyone around them saw Presley&#x27;s personality change, dramatically, from vibrant and playful to passive and introverted. Presley went through a period of celibacy, in keeping with the teachings of an Indian guru. &quot;He was going through a cleansing period, physically and spiritually. He loved me and deeply wanted to be faithful to me, but he never felt certain that he could resist temptation. It was a persistent battle, and it even got to the point where he felt he had to resist me.&quot; For the next few weeks, Elvis felt the need to withdraw himself from the temptations of sex. He said, &quot;We have to control our desires, so they don&#x27;t control us. If we can control sex, then we can master all other desires.&quot; When they were in bed, &quot;he took his usual dose of sleeping pills, handed me mine, and then, fighting off drowsiness, from the pills, poured over his metaphysical books.&quot; Priscilla was not interested, and she recalled Elvis saying, &quot;Things will never work out, between us, Cilla, because you don&#x27;t show any interest in me or my philosophies.&quot;

When this phase of his life passed, she and Elvis had a bonfire and burned the stacks of magazines and books he had accumulated on the subject. They tried marijuana, during this time, but they did not like it, as it made them ravenously hungry. Although Presley abhorred street drugs, Priscilla tells how they used LSD. While they both thought it had been an &quot;extraordinary experience,&quot; they were afraid of it and experimented, with that specific drug, only once. 

===Marriage, family, and the Nancy Sinatra factor===
Elvis and Priscilla were married on May 1, 1967, in Las Vegas, Nevada. She wrote that being called &quot;Mrs. Elvis Presley&quot; sounded better than &quot;live-in Lolita&quot;, &quot;teen heartthrob&quot; or the other labels given her in the past by some of the press. After the wedding ceremony, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s private jet flew them to their Palm Springs, California home. Being the romantic that he was, Elvis carried his new bride across the threshold singing &quot;The Hawaiian Wedding Song&quot;, then carried her straight to the bedroom.

After a second wedding reception at Graceland for friends and Memphis locals, Elvis and Priscilla went to his ranch near Horn Lake, Mississippi, where they locked themselves away for several days of much needed privacy. However, the press and the curious lined a fence on the property&#x27;s perimeter and stood on the tops of cars to take photos.
While they planned on having children, Elvis and Priscilla had hoped to wait awhile, and Priscilla was not prepared for her pregnancy. She considered an abortion, in part because Elvis had made derogatory comments in the past about &quot;women using pregnancy as an excuse to let themselves go.&quot; Feeling insecure, she dieted to the point that by the time she gave birth, she then weighed less than she had before becoming pregnant. During Priscilla&#x27;s pregnancy, she and Elvis made love passionately until she began hearing rumors about Elvis and Nancy Sinatra, his co-star in the film &quot;Speedway&quot;. When Priscilla confronted Elvis about the stories, he dismissed them out of hand, telling her she was being overly sensitive due to her &quot;condition&quot; (pregnancy). However, six months into her pregnancy, Nancy Sinatra telephoned Priscilla and said she wanted to give her a baby shower. Priscilla was apprehensive about such a request coming from a woman she hardly knew, but Elvis convinced her to accept the offer. Priscilla went along with it and she and Sinatra got along well together. Everything seemed fine until a week or so later, when Elvis informed Priscilla that he needed time to think and wanted a trial separation. Devastated, she told him: &quot;You&#x27;ve got it. Just tell me when to leave.&quot; She lived in agony for days, and Elvis silently changed his mind about the separation proposal. Two months later, their daughter Lisa Marie was born in Memphis on February 1, 1968.

===The &#x27;68 Comeback Special to the end===
Free to shape his own career, after the MGM motion picture contract expired in 1968, although still required to complete two more films, Presley accepted an offer from the NBC network to do a television special. NBC executives offered &quot;open development,” along with a young director named Steve Binder, who was receptive to presenting Presley in a way that he could be himself. &quot;Elvis Presley&#x27;s &#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot; was an enormous success, being the highest-rated television special of the year, and his closing song, titled, “If I Can Dream,” became his first million-selling record in several years.

The television special motivated Elvis, and he began recording at the American Sound Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, which was owned by Chips Moman. Filled with new energy, he recorded so many songs that RCA Records needed a year and a half to release them all. Included in these sessions were hits such as &quot;Suspicious Minds,” which went to number one on the Billboard Charts, along with &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Rain.&quot; He was signed on to perform, for a month, at the then-new and just-completed International Hotel in Las Vegas. Every show was sold out, with thousands being turned away at the door. This success led to a five-year contract for appearances, twice a year, with the largest fee ever paid to any singer in history. Unfortunately, his renewed popularity brought a large increase in the number of death threats, requiring a significant increase in personal security.

After years of personal unhappiness, due to the state of his career, for a time, his triumphant return to a live stage brought new vitality to their marriage. However, the renewed stardom, with regular touring around the United States and appearances in Las Vegas, meant he was away from his family more, and his pattern of infidelity returned. When Elvis suggested Priscilla cut back on her visits to see him, it only added to her anxieties. Things grew worse, when she returned to their Palm Springs home and found a number of letters from girls showing they had obviously been there.

Priscilla Presley admits she had two affairs of her own, and by 1972, the tumultuous marriage was irreparably broken down. The last straw, for Priscilla, came when Elvis, possibly having learned of the second affair with her karate instructor, Mike Stone, had rough sex with her in his Las Vegas hotel room, telling her, &quot;This is how a real man makes love to a woman.&quot; Also, during this time, Elvis considered hiring a hit man to kill Stone, but ultimately did not follow through with the idea. 

Separated on February 23, 1972, the Presleys divorced, amicably, on October 9, 1973, mutually agreeing to share custody of their daughter, Lisa Marie. Elvis had made another televised special, called &quot;,&quot; in January 1973, but after not seeing him for several months, prior to the actual court hearing, Priscilla was bewildered by his physical appearance. She remarked on how swollen his hands were, when she held them in hers. Less than four years later, Elvis died. After his death, his father, Vernon, agreed to have Elvis&#x27;s body reburied, to deter thieves.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Robert Hilburn wrote a critical review of the memoir, concluding: &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s intent here no doubt was to share her love for her late husband, but the book is little more than a carnival curio in what has become the sideshow called Elvis. The larger question raised by the book is the obligation survivors have to famous loved ones. One rule of thumb may be this paraphrase on the old saw: &#x27;If you can&#x27;t say anything significant, don&#x27;t say anything at all.

Broox Sledge of the &quot;Enterprise-Journal&quot; wrote that, &quot;If Elvis is your idol, perhaps you would be happier not reading &quot;Elvis and Me&quot; [...] Priscilla has taken her late husband and presented him to the world, warts and all. Some of the warts are attractive. Some are splotchy.&quot; In her review of the book for the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot;, Dannye Romine discussed the concept of Peter Pan syndrome, opining that, &quot;Peter Pan Presley was clearly an emotionally impetuous man-child who never grew up and Priscilla was oh-such-an adoring Wendy who never encouraged him to grow up.&quot;

==Influence==
The song &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; by Depeche Mode was inspired by &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;.
==Adaptations==
&quot;Elvis and Me&quot; was adapted into the 1988 two-part made-for-television miniseries of the same name. Written by Joyce Eliason and directed by Larry Peerce, the miniseries stars Dale Midkiff as Elvis and Susan Walters as Priscilla. The miniseries premiered on ABC in February 1988.

In 2022, it was announced that Sofia Coppola would direct a film adaptation of the memoir, starring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla and Jacob Elordi as Elvis. The film, titled &quot;Priscilla&quot;, premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2023. It received a limited theatrical release in the US by A24 on October 27, 2023, followed by a wide release on November 3. Priscilla served as executive producer on the film.

<doc id="1149977" wikidata="Q1195552" url="?curid=1149977" title="Morrison Formation">
<text>The Morrison Formation is a distinctive sequence of Upper Jurassic sedimentary rock found in the western United States which has been the most fertile source of dinosaur fossils in North America. It is composed of mudstone, sandstone, siltstone, and limestone and is light gray, greenish gray, or red. Most of the fossils occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones, relics of the rivers and floodplains of the Jurassic period.

It is centered in Wyoming and Colorado, with outcrops in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Equivalent rocks under different names are found in Canada. It covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers (600,000 square miles), although only a tiny fraction is exposed and accessible to geologists and paleontologists. Over 75% is still buried under the prairie to the east, and much of its western paleogeographic extent was eroded during exhumation of the Rocky Mountains.

It was named after Morrison, Colorado, where some of the first fossils in the formation were discovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877. That same year, it became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. In Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, the Morrison Formation was a major source of uranium ore.

== Geologic history ==
According to radiometric dating, the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3 ± 2 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 ± 1 million years old at the top, which places it in the earliest Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the late Jurassic. This is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. The age and much of the fauna is similar to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal. Throughout the western United States, it variously overlies the Middle Jurassic Summerville, Sundance, Bell Ranch, Wanakah, and Stump Formations.

At the time, the supercontinent of Laurasia had recently split into the continents of North America and Eurasia, although they were still connected by land bridges. North America moved north and was passing through the subtropical regions.

The Morrison Basin, which stretched from New Mexico in the south to Alberta and Saskatchewan in the north, was formed during the Nevadan orogeny, a precursor event to later orogenic episodes that created the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins, carried by streams and rivers from the Elko Highlands (along the borders of present-day Nevada and Utah) and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains, became the Morrison Formation.

In the north, the Sundance Sea, an extension of the Arctic Ocean, stretched through Canada down to the United States. Coal is found in the Morrison Formation of Montana, which means that the northern part of the formation, along the shores of the sea, was wet and swampy, with more vegetation. Aeolian, or wind-deposited sandstones, are found in the southwestern part, which indicates it was much more arid—a desert, with sand dunes.

== Stratigraphy ==


The Morrison Formation is subdivided into several members, the occurrence of which are varied across the geographic extent of the Morrison. Members are (in alphabetical order):
*Bluff Sandstone Member (AZ, CO, NM, UT): Well-sorted, light brown to white sandstone with large grains and components of chert. Interpreted as being deposited in an aeolian setting, at the edge of a dune field.
*Brushy Basin Member (AZ, CO, NM, UT): conglomerate interbedded with mudstone; up to fifty percent by volume is made up of altered vitric ash, which originated as felsic ash falls. Deposition likely occurred in a fluvial-lacustrine environment, with the lacustrine component tending towards playas.
*Fiftymile Member (UT): Mainly present in the Kaiparowits basin, consisting of interbedded sandstone and mudstone, with minimal conglomerate. Locally, it is the uppermost member and has contact with the Dakota Formation.
*Jackpile Sandstone Member (NM): primarily a whitish crossbedded subarkose sandstone with a clay matrix. It is interbedded with variegated, pale-green to red, bentonitic mudstone lenses. However, recent detrital zircon geochronology results have suggested that the Jackpile Sandstone Member is part of the Burro Canyon Formation.
*Ralston Creek Member (CO): formerly a considered separate formation and recently reclassified as the basal member of the Morrison in eastern Colorado. It appears analogous to the Tidwell and Salt Wash Members. This reclassification is supported by more detailed examination of the contacts and radiometric dating. The Ralston Creek contains conglomerate, sandstone, gypsum-mudstone, and gypsum-sandstone-mudstone facies; it is undetermined if the gypsum is of marine or lacustrine origin. 
*Recapture Member (AZ, CO, NM, UT): forms the bottom of the Morrison across most of its range, overlying the Entrada and Wanakah Formations. Consists of clayey sandstone and claystone, representing a fluvial setting, interbedded with purely aeolian sandstone facies; in places, it also contains a large (up to nineteen percent) of orthoclase feldspar inclusions.
*Salt Wash Member (CO, UT): composed of fluvial sandstone, with occasional conglomeratic tendencies.

*Tidwell Member (AZ, CO, NM, UT): in the northern part of the Colorado Plateau, it is the basal member of the Morrison. Mainly composed of siltstone, shale, and sandstone, and occasionally incorporates limestone clasts, along with thin beds of limestone. Depositional environments range from mudflats to fluvial, to evaporate and lacustrine. The Morrison as a whole resembles the Tidwell.
*Unkpapa Sandstone Member (SD): occurs primarily in western South Dakota as a well-sorted, fine-grained sandstone, consisting primarily of quartz, with some feldspar inclusions. Locally overlain by the Lakota Formation or the main body of the Morrison, and overlies the Redwater Shale Member of the Sundance Formation. Occasionally referred to as a separate formation, chiefly within the Black Hills region.
*Westwater Canyon Member (AZ, CO, NM, UT): consists of sandstone interbedded with mudstone lenses and the occasional conglomerate component. Deposited in a braided-stream environment, high in organic matter. The term &quot;Poison Canyon Sandstone&quot; is informally applied to the upper sandstone sections of the member. The Westwater Canyon Member is the main source of uranium ore in the Morrison, especially in the San Juan Basin.
*Windy Hill Member (CO, SD, UT, WY): Formerly included as the upper member of the Sundance Formation, as, like the rest of the Sundance, it was deposited in marine settings; however, it is separated by an unconformity and interfingers with the Morrison, meriting the nomenclature shift. Composed of limey, fossiliferous sandstone, generally interpreted to be deposited in a marine setting.
Other informal or disused designations of the Morrison include the Stockett Bed in Montana, an unofficial sub-unit which contains bituminous coal; the outdated terms Casamero, Chavez, and Prewitt Sandstone for the Brushy Basin, Recapture, and Westwater Canyon, respectively; and the Bullington Member, which has been discarded entirely.

== Fossil content ==
Though many of the Morrison Formation fossils are fragmentary, they are sufficient to provide a good picture of the flora and fauna in the Morrison Basin during the Kimmeridgian. Overall, the climate was dry, similar to a savanna but, since there were no angiosperms (grasses, flowers, and some trees), the flora was quite different. Conifers, the dominant plants of the time, were to be found with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetail rushes. Much of the fossilized vegetation was riparian, living along the river flood plains. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and mammaliforms.

The dinosaurs were most likely riparian, as well. Hundreds of dinosaur fossils have been discovered, such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, several stegosaurs comprising at least two species of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; and the slightly older &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot;, and the early ankylosaurs, &quot;Mymoorapelta&quot; and &quot;Gargoyleosaurus&quot;, most notably a very broad range of sauropods (the giants of the Mesozoic era). Since at least some of these species are known to have nested in the area (&quot;Camptosaurus&quot; embryoes have been discovered), there are indications that it was a good environment for dinosaurs and not just home to migratory, seasonal populations. However, the large body mass of the sauropods has been interpreted as an adaptation to migration in times of drought.

Sauropods that have been discovered include &quot;Diplodocus&quot; (most famously, the first nearly complete specimen of &quot;D. carnegii&quot;, which is now exhibited at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; (the most commonly found sauropod), &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, the uncommon &quot;Haplocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. The very diversity of the sauropods has raised some questions about how they could all co-exist. While their body shapes are very similar (long neck, long tail, huge elephant-like body), they are assumed to have had very different feeding strategies, in order for all to have existed in the same time frame and similar environment.

=== Sites and quarries ===

Locations where significant Morrison Formation fossil discoveries have been made include:

==== Colorado ====

* Garden Park, Colorado: One of the three major sites excavated by the paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope during the Bone Wars in 1877, though most of the specimens were too incomplete to classify (&quot;nomina dubia&quot;) during the 1877-78 field seasons. The first nearly complete skeletons of &quot;Stegosaurus, Ceratosaurus,&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; were discovered at the site, including the type specimens of the former two and the proposed neotype of &quot;Allosaurus fragilis,&quot; in the 1883-1886 Yale field seasons. In 1992, a specimen of &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot; was discovered with its armor still in place, which confirmed that the dinosaur had two rows of plates on its back.
* Dry Mesa Quarry, Colorado: A wide variety of fauna, as well as the most diverse set of dinosaurs from any Morrison Formation quarry. The first dig was in 1972, by researchers from Brigham Young University. Unique specimens include the longest dinosaur known, &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, the &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, and the largest carnivore on the continent, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;.
* Fruita Paleontological Resource Area: Badlands sites located south of Fruita, were actively worked by George Callison from California State University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Numerous specimens of mammals, lizards, and crocodiles were found. Most recently, &quot;Fruitafossor windscheffelia&quot; and the new dinosaur &quot;Fruitadens&quot; were described from the area.
* Purgatoire River track site, Otero County.

==== Utah ====
* Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Utah: First excavated by geologists from the University of Utah in the late 1920s. William Lee Stokes led an expedition from Princeton in 1939. During the Jurassic, the quarry was likely an ephemeral pond, where dinosaurs gathered and died due to severe drought. Their bodies were reworked by seasonal flooding events, which also added other partial carcasses from elsewhere. &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; is by far the most common dinosaur at this site, making it a model organism for studies of paleobiology in basal theropods. The rare theropods &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot; and &quot;Marshosaurus&quot; specimens were also first discovered here.
* Dinosaur National Monument, Utah: First excavated by Earl Douglas working for the Carnegie Museum in 1909 with the purpose of finding sauropods from the Morrison Formation for public display. Monument also has fossilized dinosaurs from the Cedar Mountain Formation. 
* Hanksville-Burpee Quarry, Hanksville

==== Wyoming ====
* Bone Cabin Quarry, Wyoming
* Como Bluff, Wyoming: One of the most renowned fossil sites in North America. It was first worked by Cope and particularly Marsh in 1877 and has been the source of many different sauropods and non-dinosaur species. The Cloverly Formation from the Cretaceous and some Triassic strata are also exposed at this location.
* The Wyoming Dinosaur Center, Thermopolis
* Ten Sleep, including Dana Quarry from where at least 12 sauropods and theropods are recovered.

==Economic geology==
The Morrison Formation contains uranium deposits, including the Jackpile uranium body discovered near Grants, New Mexico in 1951. The ore deposits in the rich Grants mineral belt are concentrated in sandstone beds of the Westwater Canyon Member and the Jackpile Member. Mines in this belt produced of U3O8 between 1948 and 2002. The uranium was precipitated by plant debris and humate that acted as reducing agents.

<text>Philip Fox La Follette (May 8, 1897August 18, 1965) was an American politician who served during the 1930s as Governor of Wisconsin. La Follette first served as a Republican from 1931 until 1933, where he lost renomination in 1932. He later served again as a member of the Wisconsin Progressive Party, from 1935 until 1939, where he was defeated for re-election in 1938. Following his defeat in 1932, he helped found the Wisconsin Progressive Party.

==Early life &amp; education==
La Follette was born on May 8, 1897 in Madison, Wisconsin, to former congressman Robert M. La Follette and women&#x27;s suffrage activist Belle Case La Follette. At the time of his birth he had been the third of four children.

La Follette served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Infantry in 1918, during World War I. In 1919 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Wisconsin and in 1922 a Bachelor of Laws degree.

== Early political career ==

=== 1924 U.S. Presidential election ===
La Follette served on his father&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1924.

=== Dane County district attorney ===
He was the district attorney for Dane County, Wisconsin, from 1925 to 1927.

=== Political campaigns ===

== First governorship ==
La Follette entered the gubernatorial election in 1930 against incumbent governor Walter J. Kohler Sr.. During the campaign La Follette and his allies criticized the governor for conservative policies and tied him to the unpopular administration of Herbert Hoover. During his first term, La Follette began implementing policies to alleviate the Great Depression. Many of the policies enacted under him would later serve as models for the federal government under Franklin D. Roosevelt.

During his first term La Follette enacted state ownership of public utilities, conservation and employment programs to help the unemployed. Additionally, La Follette helped set up a program for unemployment insurance, the first of its kind in the country, and a single state-wide labor code.

=== Defeat ===
La Follette was defeated in the Republican primary because of the worsening conditions of the Great Depression, as well as broader dissatisfaction with his service as governor. He was defeated for re-election by former governor Kohler.

== Out of government ==

=== Travels to Europe ===

=== Wisconsin Progressive Party ===
By 1934, the Great Depression had caused a sharp decline of conditions in Wisconsin, and this decline, alongside a resurgence of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, forced progressive Republicans to seek new ways into office.

While La Follette eventually supported a split from the Republicans, he worked alongside William T. Evjue, the editor of the Madison-based &quot;Capital Times&quot; to curb the more radical influences of Amlie and his radical allies.

Separately from La Follette and his allies, more radical elements of the third party movement established the Farmer-Labor-Progressive League (FLPL), which would develop a platform and endorse candidates in elections, this new organization had the potential to upset the aims La Follette had been working for with the new party. Fortunately, after La Follette spoke at the F.L.P.L. convention, the League decided to support his party.

== Second governorship ==
Following his re-election, La Follette took a far different tone for his second term than he had for his first. In his second inaugural address he stressed the need for reform in more concrete terms, advocating for an increase in executive power and calling for increased spending towards schools and wages despite a projected $9 million dollar shortfall in the budget.

=== Wisconsin Works Bill ===
One of La Follette&#x27;s most radical pieces of legislation up to that point was the Wisconsin Works Bill, which would have established a state controlled public works and relief program. The program had the backing of Roosevelt, who was supportive of state efforts at experimentation.

In planning out the Bill, La Follette asked the Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee to expand its inventory of public works projects. Additionally, La Follette employed his secretary, Thomas Duncan and state adjudant general Ralph Immell to develop a plan to finance and assemble administrative details for the program respectively. Alongside the other two, Ralph Hoyt, a Milwaukee lawyer, was charged with developing methods to circumvent financial limitations in the state constitution. The plan additionally was ironed out over a week in early May with several of Roosevelt&#x27;s directors and advisors, such as Harry Hopkins, Frank Walker, Harold Ickes, and Rexford Tugwell.

When the legislation was finally submitted to the legislature, Democrats turned against the governor, accusing La Follette of using the bill as a means of gaining more control over work relief in the state. To try and push the legislature to support his bill, La Follette began a campaign, using the bully pulpit to appeal to the constituents of opposed senators.

Within the legislation, it provided for the creation of a Wisconsin Finance Authority, which was intended to bypass financial restrictions within the state constitution. The directors of the Authority would be appointed by the governor directly. Additionally, the Authority would be able to issue up to $100 million dollars worth of its own notes, which would be exchangeable with U.S. dollars and act as valid means to pay state and local taxes. Additionally, the bill contained provisions for old age pensions, public school subsidies, and an amendment to balance the state budget. La Follette would contend that the plan would eventually pay for itself.

The plan immediately faced backlash from conservatives, socialists, municipal governments, and bankers. Critiques argued the plan was too vague in its financing provisions, its constitutionality, and that it concentrated too much power in the hands of the governor. Despite this, the Roosevelt administration expressed support for the passage of the legislation. In the end, the bill was defeated in the state senate by a vote of 9 for, and 14 against. Even after several amendments, the bill was again defeated in the state senate, this time by a vote of 16 for and 17 against.

During the 1936 election, La Follette made the failure of the Works Bill a central part of his campaign and, thanks in part to the national Democratic wave that year, won enough seats that he could then pass a &quot;Little New Deal&quot; in the 1937 session.

Following the defeat of the Works Bill, La Follette recommended Immell be appointed as Wisconsin director of the Works Progress Administration. Throughout the course of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, he would continue criticizing his relief efforts as insufficient compared to the failed Works Bill.

=== Wisconsin Reorganization Orders ===
Following his re-election in 1936, La Follette began creating plans to radically alter the structure of government in the state. To this end he drafted the Wisconsin Reorganization Orders, which would &quot;transfer certain divisions, agencies, functions, powers, and duties to the Executive,&quot; and allow the governor to propose bills that the legislature could either ratify or reject such bills.

Following a drawn out three-week legislative session, La Follette began attempting alternative means to get the legislature to act on his proposals, despite opposition from Democrats and Republicans, both houses of the legislature passed changes to the governing rules to speed up the passage of legislation. In coordination with Assembly Speaker Paul Alfonsi, and progressive members of the state Senate, they began quickly forcing legislation through the chamber using the new rules, passing a farm bill, a commerce bill, and a bill for mortgage moratoriums all in quick succession.

During the session, bills were introduced and passed with restrictions on parliamentary debate and without hearings from the public. Additionally, the presiding officers of both chambers would repeatedly rule standard parliamentary procedure as out of order. With the final hours of the session spent confirming 24 of La Follette&#x27;s administrative appointments. The session immediately drew controversy as members of both major parties left the chamber shouting &quot;heil&quot; in a mock Nazi salute. while comparisons were made in the media to the dictatorial actions of the deceased Governor of Louisiana Huey Long

The special session caused a rift within the Wisconsin Progressive Party as members like Evjue sharply criticized La Follette and his conduct in the special session.

=== National Progressives of America ===

To announce the formation of his national third party, La Follette planned a rally in Madison. At this rally he had the area decorated in red, white, and blue, with a military band playing marching music and other patriotic songs and football players for the University of Wisconsin-Madison acting as ushers and bouncers for the event. In all, upwards of 3,500 people attended the rally. After building up enthusiasm among the attendees, La Follette unveiled a new program for his National Progressives of America (N.P.A.). The announcement of the party had drawn mixed responses from the public and other progressives. Various national liberal figures, allies of Roosevelt, organized labor, and even allies of La Follette declined to support the new party. The media offered criticism of the party platform, with many media outlets calling it vague and lacking in definite proposals, while the party itself was described as having fascist overtones. Even harsher criticism was instead leveled at the symbol for the party, which was compared to a swastika.

After its formation, La Follette traveled the country in an attempt to recruit allies to his cause and build up the party. In response, various progressive and liberal figures declined to affiliate and expressed disinterest in the party.

While La Follette was absent from Wisconsin, the state progressive party began to collapse, as factionalism and intraparty bickering began to take hold. Additionally, many of his old allies, such as Alfonsi, felt sidelined by La Follette, as many of them did not agree with the formation of the N.P.A.. Due to his prolonged absences, La Follette appointed Immell as the National Progressive&#x27;s National Director.

=== 1938 election ===
By the end of his third term, La Follette felt reluctant to seek a fourth term. Instead he felt it was more important to devote his time and energy to promoting the N.P.A., but upon being dissatisfied with the performance of Ekern, and no one else volunteering to run, he ultimately decided to run for a fourth term. By the 1938 elections, the divisions in the state Progressive Party had grown even more wide, and while La Follette and his brother remained neutral, they privately supported their ally Ekern over the more radical Amlie in the Senate primary that year, and their lack of endorsement exacerbated tensions between both sides, with supporters of Amlie threatening to leave the party over it. Even during his campaign, La Follette continued to express a hesitancy to serve a fourth term, at one point considering stating an intention to take the office if Progressives elected a majority in the state legislature.

The results in the primary election became a sign of what was to come in November, as Progressives in the primary ran tens of thousands of votes behind the Republicans and Democrats. Additionally, Republicans and Democrats began serious efforts at collaboration, whereby the party nominee with the least votes from each contest would withdraw. The initial Democratic nominee, Robert Kirkland Henry, withdrew in favor of Republican nominee Julius P. Heil.

While the results of the primary only caused the progressives to unify around themselves, they were unable to escape defeat in November. In an election with lower turnout, La Follette was defeated by Heil by a margin of 190,294 votes, with Republicans reclaiming the other state executive offices, the state legislature, the Class III U.S. Senate seat, and all but two congressional seats.

Part of their defeat was attributed to a lack of improvement of the conditions from the Great Depression, as well as the gradual decline in the ability for the state alone to handle the problems of the Depression. After his defeat, La Follette effectively retired from electoral politics.

== Later life and career ==
Following his defeat, La Follette attempted to keep the N.P.A. going, at the expense of the Wisconsin Progressive Party. He also decided to leave the United States and travel across Europe to see the situation there at the time. During his travels, he became increasingly troubled by the effects fascism and Nazism had on Italy and Germany respectively, with him calling fascism the &quot;greatest menace facing the United States.&quot; Eventually, La Follette came to criticize the Franco-British policy of Appeasement towards Germany. Around this time La Follette returned to his legal career, also writing articles for &quot;The Progressive&quot;. He also actively campaigned for his brother and other progressive candidates in Wisconsin in 1940, but they allbar Robert Jr.went down in defeat.

By 1946, the Wisconsin Progressive Party had all but collapsed, barely qualifying for major party status after the 1944 elections. While La Follette had desired for the party to continue on, after being advised to stay out of the 1946 convention, the Party voted to dissolve itself, voting 284 to 131 to rejoin the Republican Party. La Follette himself decided to support progressive candidates in the Republican Primaries that year, such as Ralph Immell. Similar to 1940, the progressive candidates all faced defeat in their bids, including Robert Jr.

After the war, La Follette made an effort to rebuild his legal office, pursue other ventures, and become more involved in the lives of his children.

=== World War II ===
Once the war broke out, La Follette became an isolationist, criticizing the British and French governments for not doing enough to stop the rise of Adolf Hitler. La Follette began criticizing the Roosevelt administration as well, especially their efforts to repeal the arms embargo, which he believed would lead to war between the United States and Germany and lead to a loss of liberty in the United States.

Eventually, La Follette found himself involved with the America First Committee, working alongside figures such as Charles Lindbergh, which led some to assume he had shifted towards more conservative politics.

Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, La Follette abandoned his isolationism and enlisted in the army, serving at Fort Myer, Virginia, for a time before transferring to the Pacific Theater. During La Follette&#x27;s time in the Pacific, he served under General Douglas MacArthur as his public relations officer. It was in the Pacific Theater that La Follette developed an admiration for MacArthur, comparing him to Julius Caesar, George Washington, and Ulysses S. Grant. La Follette felt such a strong attachment to the general as he felt MacArthur reminded him of his father. La Follette would ultimately serve under MacArthur from October 1942 until June 1945.

Following the end of the war, La Follette was offered a position as military governor of Bavaria, which had been within the American occupation zone of Germany. Despite his own personal desire to take up the role, he eventually turned down the offer, citing both monetary concerns and his belief that he did not have the support of president Harry S. Truman.

=== Later campaigns ===
Following the war, La Follette re-entered the Wisconsin political scene, this time in support of MacArthur&#x27;s brief 1948 presidential campaign. To this end he would spearhead a slate of delegates to the 1948 Republican National Convention supporting MacArthur&#x27;s nomination for the presidency. Such a slate included many people La Follette had opposed during the Great Depression, but worked with out of a common interest to support MacArthur, a fact which perplexed many of his contemporaries. In the general election he endorsed Thomas E. Dewey over incumbent president Truman. He also supported the presidential campaigns of Earl Warren and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.

=== Business ventures ===
In March 1940 La Follette was elected to the board of directors of Fairbanks-Morse.

In 1946, La Follette began working for the Hazeltine Corporation as associate general-counsel for the company. Working for the company often forced him to travel between Wisconsin and New York, and La Follette eventually moved to New York City with his family in 1955, when he was elected president of Hazeltine&#x27;s Electronics Division.

=== Death ===

After his time at Hazeltine, La Follette returned to Madison, where he retired to practice law part-time and continue writing his autobiography. It was also during this time that he was active as part of the Wisconsin Historical Society.

He died in Madison, Wisconsin on August 18, 1965 and was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery.

== Personal life and family ==
La Follette married Isabel Bacon in 1923, and had three children with her; Robert III, Judith, and Sherry, born 1926, 1929, and 1936 respectively; none of them went on to pursue careers in politics.

Phil was part of the La Follette family, which included his brother, Robert M. La Follette Jr., his nephew Bronson La Follette, his sister Fola La Follette, and by way of her marriage, also playwrite George Middleton.

<doc id="1149993" wikidata="Q5191526" url="?curid=1149993" title="Csaba Elthes">
<text>&quot;Maestro&quot; Csaba Elthes (March 10, 1912 – November 8, 1995) was a Hungarian fencing master who emigrated to the U.S. in 1956. Elthes trained many Olympic competitors in the 1960s through 1980s, including the only U.S. Olympic fencing medalist of the period, Peter Westbrook (bronze medal in 1984).

==Early life==
Born in Budapest, Hungary, Elthes earned a degree in law from University of Budapest in 1936. In 1956, political turmoil in Hungary caused him to leave his wife and two daughters and flee to the west via the Brücke von Andau. He arrived in the United States and was detained for 60 days.

==In the USA==
Determining that he would not be able to find work as a lawyer in the United States, he decided that fencing might be a good way to make a living. Investigating the competitions of the time, he realized that while American foil fencing was already at a fairly high level (he cited Olympians Albie Axelrod and Daniel Bukantz in particular), there were opportunities in sabre and epee, and he quickly found employment at the salle of maestro Giorgio Santelli in New York City.

Elthes and Santelli were largely (but not solely) responsible for making the New York City area the center of US sabre fencing for most of their careers; Elthes was a US Olympic fencing coach in 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984. As late as 1992, the entire US Olympic sabre team was based at NYC salles and clubs. Elthes generally gave lessons both at the Fencers Club and at the New York Athletic Club. For at least three years (1968-71) he was the fencing coach at Pace University.

==Teaching style==
In his teaching, Elthes stressed balance and footwork, and treated fencing as an intellectual pursuit as well as an athletic one. When teaching, he often gave very few verbal instructions, indicating that the student should attempt to strike by exposing a potential target, or illustrating the weakness of a student&#x27;s attack with a well-placed stop-cut.

The Hungarian school of instruction practiced by Elthes was famed for discipline, sarcasm, and competitiveness, but always making it clear that there was respect between teacher and student (as exemplified by Elthes frequently calling students &quot;Mr. Sir&quot; (pronounced &quot;Meester Sore&quot; due to his heavy Hungarian accent), which tended to create fierce loyalty.

Students got more instructor time the better their performance. Former student and longtime friend of Elthes, Olympian Robert Blum noted &quot;Occasional verbal insults were received as gratuities!&quot;

Personal courage and disregard for discomfort were also part of the formula; for very advanced students, Elthes sometimes gave lessons without a mask, and nearly all serious students were disciplined by being hit with a sabre, sometimes hard enough to draw blood; Danny Bukantz&#x27; son Jeff, a student from the 1970s, notes &quot;I think I may have been the only student that Csaba didn&#x27;t hit. I always thought it might have been because my father was his dentist&quot;.

Peter Westbrook quit working with Elthes after three months in 1972, unwilling to tolerate the maestro&#x27;s teaching style. He initially found Elthes to be intimidating, saying: &quot;Csaba&#x27;s theory is discipline with pain. Never a compliment, usually belittlement. I was stunned.&quot; It went beyond unkind words: &quot;I thought he was crazy. Then he started hitting me in the legs with his sabre every time I made a mistake, and I was wearing short pants, too. He said, &#x27;I want you to associate mistakes with pain.` And then, whack, whack, whack. Right across the thighs. Then I knew he was crazy.&quot;

The following year, Westbrook began working with Elthes again, and Elthes no longer struck him, coaching him to his first of 13 US National Sabre titles in 1974.

Of him, Westbrook wrote; Csaba believed in me and worked me like a dog, goading me, inspiring me, always pushing me beyond what I thought I could or would do. I was lucky to have had 8 years with Csaba in his prime before his stroke in 1980. The stroke paralyzed his right hand so he taught w/his left until he recovered some use in his right. Csaba came to love New York and his life here in the U.S., he went back to Hungary every year on vacation to visit his daughters from his first wife and family, but New York was his home. He never lost that formality between us, just the one time (May 1977) when he punctured my throat by accident, the only time I have ever seen him cry or drop his formality with me.

==Hall of Fame and beyond==
Elthes was inducted into the USFA Hall of Fame in 1978.

In 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow. Elthes and the US Fencing team instead went on a State Department sponsored trip to China, spending three weeks traveling through four different provinces competing against China&#x27;s top teams. Later that year, Elthes suffered a stroke, paralyzing his right hand, but he learned to teach with his left until he had recovered some use of the right, and switched hands as needed for the rest of his career.

In 1981, his student Michael Lofton becomes US Junior Olympic sabre champion, beginning a career as one of the United States&#x27; top fencers.

His passion for fencing and competition never wavered; in 1994, he convinced Peter Westbrook to train for and participate in the 1995 Pan American Games, where Westbrook won a gold medal at the age of 42.

Elthes died of a stroke in 1995 when visiting his home city of Budapest. He was survived by his second wife, Baba, who resides in New York.

Among Elthes&#x27; students are US Olympic competitors Westbrook, George Worth, Robert Blum, Allan Kwartler, Marty Lang, Paul Apostol, Mika&#x27;il Sankofa (formerly Michael Lofton), and Steve Mormando, as well as Olympic fencing referee and Maccabiah Games medalist Russell Wilson.

<doc id="1149996" wikidata="Q1983701" url="?curid=1149996" title="Instant-on">
<text>In computing, instant-on is the ability to boot nearly instantly, allowing to go online or to use a specific application without waiting for a PC&#x27;s traditional operating system to launch. Instant-on technology is today mostly used on laptops, netbooks, and nettops because the user can boot up one program, instead of waiting for the PC&#x27;s operating system to boot. This allows a user to launch a single program, such as a movie-playing program or a web browser, without the need of the whole operating system. There still remain a few true instant-on machines such as the Atari ST, as described in the Booting article. These machines had complete Operating Systems resident in ROM similar to the way in which the BIOS function is conventionally provided on current computer architectures. The &quot;instant-on&quot; concept as used here results from loading an OS, such as a legacy system DOS, with a small hard drive footprint. Latency inherent to mechanical drive performance can also be eliminated by using Live USB or Live SD flash memory to load systems at electronic speeds which are orders of magnitude faster.

==Pros and cons==
An instant-on operating system is like those used by 1980s home computers such as the Commodore 64. This offers many advantages over a standard modern operating system:
* faster booting;
* less vulnerable to malware as the system is mostly read-only;
* allows for diskless computers;
* lighter;
* lower power consumption.

However, this comes at the price of having limited local functionality, while focusing on web / cloud services. 

==Consumer electronics==
In the past, consumer electronics manufacturers would emblazon radios and television sets with &quot;Instant On&quot; or &quot;Instant Play&quot; decals. In series filament sets, instant-on was accomplished by adding only a silicon diode across the power switch to keep tube filaments lit at 50% power; the diode was placed such that the typical half wave rectifier of the day was reverse-biased. Instant-on advantages included near-instant operation of the television or radio and potentially longer vacuum tube life; disadvantages included energy consumption and risk of fire. Most solid state consumer electronics are inherently instant-on, so the moniker survived into the early solid state era to differentiate a product from its vacuum-tube based brethren (with CRTs being a notable exception).

<doc id="1149999" wikidata="Q1192782" url="?curid=1149999" title="L (complexity)">
<text>In computational complexity theory, L (also known as LSPACE, LOGSPACE or DLOGSPACE) is the complexity class containing decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of writable memory space. Formally, the Turing machine has two tapes, one of which encodes the input and can only be read, whereas the other tape has logarithmic size but can be written as well as read. Logarithmic space is sufficient to hold a constant number of pointers into the input and a logarithmic number of Boolean flags, and many basic logspace algorithms use the memory in this way.

==Complete problems and logical characterization==
Every non-trivial problem in L is complete under log-space reductions, so weaker reductions are required to identify meaningful notions of L-completeness, the most common being first-order reductions.

A 2004 result by Omer Reingold shows that USTCON, the problem of whether there exists a path between two vertices in a given undirected graph, is in L, showing that L = SL, since USTCON is SL-complete.

One consequence of this is a simple logical characterization of L: it contains precisely those languages expressible in first-order logic with an added commutative transitive closure operator (in graph theoretical terms, this turns every connected component into a clique). This result has application to database query languages: &quot;data complexity&quot; of a query is defined as the complexity of answering a fixed query considering the data size as the variable input. For this measure, queries against relational databases with complete information (having no notion of nulls) as expressed for instance in relational algebra are in L.

==Related complexity classes==

L is a subclass of NL, which is the class of languages decidable in logarithmic space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. A problem in NL may be transformed into a problem of reachability in a directed graph representing states and state transitions of the nondeterministic machine, and the logarithmic space bound implies that this graph has a polynomial number of vertices and edges, from which it follows that NL is contained in the complexity class P of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time. Thus L ⊆ NL ⊆ P. The inclusion of L into P can also be proved more directly: a decider using &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) space cannot use more than 2&quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;&quot;O&quot;(1) time, because this is the total number of possible configurations.

L further relates to the class NC in the following way:
NC1 ⊆ L ⊆ NL ⊆ NC2.
In words, given a parallel computer &quot;C&quot; with a polynomial number &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;) of processors for some constant &quot;k&quot;, any problem that can be solved on &quot;C&quot; in &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) time is in L, and any problem in L can be solved in &quot;O&quot;(log2 &quot;n&quot;) time on &quot;C&quot;.

Important open problems include whether L = P, and whether L = NL. It is not even known whether L = NP.

The related class of function problems is FL. FL is often used to define logspace reductions.

==Additional properties==
L is low for itself, because it can simulate log-space oracle queries (roughly speaking, &quot;function calls which use log space&quot;) in log space, reusing the same space for each query.

==Other uses==
The main idea of logspace is that one can store a polynomial-magnitude number in logspace and use it to remember pointers to a position of the input.

The logspace class is therefore useful to model computation where the input is too big to fit in the RAM of a computer. Long DNA sequences and databases are good examples of problems where only a constant part of the input will be in RAM at a given time and where we have pointers to compute the next part of the input to inspect, thus using only logarithmic memory.

<doc id="1150002" wikidata="Q1429154" url="?curid=1150002" title="Hyperreflexia">
<text>Hyperreflexia is overactive or overresponsive bodily reflexes. Examples of this include twitching and spastic tendencies, which indicate disease of the upper motor neurons and the lessening or loss of control ordinarily exerted by higher brain centers of lower neural pathways.

Spinal cord injury is the most common cause of hyperreflexia. Standard stimuli, such as the filling of the bladder, can cause excessive responses from the nervous system. The causes of hyperreflexia are not known.

Hyperreflexia also has many other causes, including the side effects of drugs (e.g., stimulants), hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, serotonin syndrome, severe brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, Reye syndrome, and pre-eclampsia.

Recovery from hyperreflexia can occur several hours to several months after a spinal cord injury; the phase of recovery is likely to occur in stages rather than on a continuum. The late stage is between two weeks and several months. Patients with a severe spinal cord injury mainly present with a later stage of recovery because during the early stages they present with spinal shock. Reflex and motor recovery can sometimes occur simultaneously.

<text>The Sheffield Steelers are a professional ice hockey team located in Sheffield, England. They were formed in 1991 and play their home games at the Utilita Arena. They are currently a member of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The club&#x27;s main (title) sponsor is Sheffield Window Centre.

==History==
Ice Hockey existed in amateur form in Sheffield, but the sport began its return to an era of arenas and stadium size crowds with the opening of the Sheffield Arena in 1991 and the creation of the Sheffield Steelers — the ice hockey team that was to occupy the new arena. The Sheffield Arena was built as part of the city&#x27;s facilities for the staging of the World Student Games, and is a sizeable stadium originally seating 8,500 and located close to the city centre. Ronnie Wood and David Gardener-Brown were at the helm as the Marketing Director at the club and set about promoting ice hockey to a city raised on the footballing success of Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday. Wood had a specific target, seeking to attract children and families to the city&#x27;s new sporting Arena. They also began taking players to local football matches and together with mascots in an attempt to pull in football fans too. The Steelers&#x27; announcer David Simms gave certain players nicknames in the 1991–92 season to help the crowd associate with the players such as &#x27;Rocket Ron Shudra, &#x27;Stormin&#x27; Steve Nemeth and &#x27;Magic&#x27; Mark Mackie.

The Steelers were named in honour of Sheffield&#x27;s industrial past, much like the American football team of the same name based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the sharing of nicknames is merely a coincidence. The American football team actually predates Sheffield&#x27;s team by 58 years and was already popular worldwide due to their dominance in the National Football League in the 1970s. Sheffield and Pittsburgh are considered sister cities.

The Steelers have continued to fill the capacity of the Arena nearly every season since, including over 9,000 vs Nottingham on Boxing Day 2021. Sheffield began breaking several British ice hockey attendance records, and in March 1996 added an extra 1,200 seats to the Arena to meet the growing demand. The Manchester v Sheffield game in 1997 saw a UK record 17,245, such was the passion for the game at that time.

On Sunday 3 December 2006, the Steelers played in their 1000th ever game. The game was against the Basingstoke Bison at the Hallam FM Arena, for which special orange jerseys had been made for the match. The Steelers lost the game 3–2 and the jerseys were all auctioned off at the game.

===2000–present===
In the 2000–01 campaign the Steelers completed a Grand Slam, becoming only the second club to win the Autumn Cup, League, Challenge Cup and Playoff Titles in the same season. They retained the Play-off title the following season, the first team to achieve this in the Superleague era, beating Manchester Storm on penalties in the Play-Off final, held at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham in front of a full house.

David Matsos was appointed as coach for the 2006–07 season. He led the Steelers to a fourth-place finish in the league and a place in the Challenge Cup Finals.

In 2007 team Owner Bob Phillips and his wife sold their other Elite League club the Cardiff Devils in order to concentrate on building the Steelers. The club won that season&#x27;s Elite League Playoff Championship after beating the Coventry Blaze 2–0 in the final with goals from Johnathan Phillips and Dan Tessier. The Steelers were knocked out of the following season&#x27;s Knockout Cup and Challenge Cup early, but finished first in a league campaign that saw them lose just three times in regulation. They made this a double by beating Nottingham Panthers 2–0 in the Play-Off final. The Steelers season ended in the Quarter Finals of the Play-offs after being knocked out by the Cardiff Devils.

The 2010–11 season was preceded by a &quot;walk-out&quot; of Steelers management and office staff, after a vote of no confidence in Owner Bob Phillips. Phillips put the club up for sale, and in December 2010 Paul Ragan, the CEO and owner of the Cardiff Devils, finalised acquiring the rights to the Sheffield Steelers. The Steelers were at the top of the league for the majority of the season, battling it out with the Cardiff Devils, and won the league after back-to-back victories against the Braehead Clan. The Steelers were tied on points with Cardiff but won the league having more regulation time wins. After several rounds of negotiations, Simon decided not to renew his contract, and Ryan Finnerty was installed as player/coach after. During that season Sheffield Steelers became the first EIHL team to win a medal in Europe after their appearance in the Continental Cup superfinal.

Tony Smith took over as sole owner in August 2011 after buying out Paul Ragan. The Steelers won the 2013–14 Play-Off final 3–2 against Belfast Giants.

From 2014 onwards any time that the Sheffield Steelers win a home game the player dubbed Man of the Match does a fast lap around the ice with a pre-planned celebration at the end of their fast lap. This tradition was then called &quot;the Eddy&quot; named after the player who originated this tradition Cullen Eddy. Some sources say that this was originally a prank devised by players at the time Mark Thomas and Jason Hewitt who skated over to Eddy and told him that it was a 20 year tradition at the club to do a fast lap around the perimeter of the ice. The prank paid off and after that the Steelers incorporated this in their match night celebrations

At the end of season 2014–15 they beat the Cardiff Devils to clinch the Elite League title with 74 points. On 20 April 2015, they parted company with coach Gerad Adams. They soon brought in Paul Thompson, former GB coach, as head coach and general manager. At the end of season 2015–16 they became only the second club in the history of ice hockey to become back to back champions when they defeated the Fife Flyers on the final day of the season to take the title.

Paul Thompson left the Sheffield Steelers on 1 October 2018, citing personal reasons. He was replaced as head coach by Tom Barrasso. On 16 April 2019 the club announced that Aaron Fox had been appointed as head coach and general manager of the club.
On 8 March 2020, the Steelers won the 2019–20 Challenge Cup beating Cardiff Devils 4–3 – their first Challenge Cup title for 17 years.

On 28 October 2023, during a game against the Sheffield Steelers at Utilita Arena, Adam Johnson of the Nottingham Panthers sustained a fatal injury. The injury occurred when Johnson&#x27;s neck came into contact with the skate of Steelers player Matt Petgrave. The game was halted immediately, and medical personnel from both teams, as well as medically trained spectators, rushed to assist. Players from both teams gathered around Johnson during the emergency response efforts. South Yorkshire Police are conducting an investigation into the incident and have urged the public to avoid speculation while inquiries continue.

On 13 March 2024, the Sheffield Steelers brought an end to their four year trophy drought by winning the Challenge Cup at home against the Guildford Flames 3–1, their second Challenge Cup title in the Elite League era. On 24 March 2024, the Sheffield Steelers would clinch the Elite League title for the first time since the 2015–16 EIHL season qualifying them for the 2024–25 Champions Hockey League season.

<text>Italo Santelli (15 August 1866 – 8 February 1945) was an Italian fencer who is considered to be the &quot;father of modern sabre fencing&quot;.

==Biography==
Italo Santelli was born in Carrodano (La Spezia), Italy in 1866. He studied at famous Italian schools, including the Scuola Magistrale of Rome (Scuola Magistrale Militare di Roma), where he graduated in 1889. In 1896 Santelli was considered an established fencing master, and Santelli moved to Budapest together with brother Otello, also a fencer, and his wife. Santelli had his son, Giorgio, in Hungary in 1897, who always kept his Italian citizenship, before leaving for the USA.

It was in Hungary that Italo Santelli began to create a new style of sabre fencing. The style involved a much more quick defense than classical training called for, and became known as the &quot;modern style&quot; of Santelli.

Santelli displayed this modern style at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris on the Italian team. He came in 6th at the foil competition, but took home a silver medal in sabre, his teammate Antonio Conte taking the gold. He later coached George Worth, born György Woittitz, the Hungarian-born American Olympic medalist fencer, in Budapest.
==Post-Olympics==
At the 1924 Summer Olympics, Kovács, a Hungarian judge, made a controversial call in a fencing match, siding with France over Italy. An Italian fencer, Aldo Boni, verbally attacked the judge for the ruling and refused to apologize when asked. Santelli was called in as a witness to Boni&#x27;s outbreak, and the Italian team was forced to resign from the competition.

Once in Italy, Adolfo Cotronei, a writer and journalist from Naples, who worked for Italian papers such as Paese, Pungolo, Don Marzio, Mattino, Corriere della Sera and Gazzetta dello Sport accused Italo Santelli of speaking out against Boni to remove him from the competition, supposedly fearing they would eliminate his adopted nation of Hungary, who would go on to take the bronze at the 1924 Games. In one of his writings, the journalist made remarks wholly detrimental to Santelli. So, he was challenged to a duel by Italo Santelli&#x27;s son, Giorgio. Under the rules of the &quot;code duello&quot;, Giorgio Santelli defended his father&#x27;s honor and won the duel by delivering a blow to Cotronei&#x27;s cheek, severing a nerve under his left eye (Cotronei&#x27;s eye was irreparably damaged during that Summer). The challenge took place on 28 August 1924, when Giorgio Santelli was a skilled 27-year-old fencer, while his opponent was just a circa 46-year-old man of letters. Santelli and Cotronei met again and made their peace eight years later, at the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. 
Italo Santelli went on to coach numerous notable fencing students over the course of his career.

Italo Santelli died on 8 February 1945, at the age of 78, in Livorno, Italy.

<doc id="1150011" wikidata="Q7479" url="?curid=1150011" title="Emperor Yingzong of Song">
<text>Emperor Yingzong of Song (16 February 1032 – 25 January 1067), personal name Zhao Shu, was the fifth emperor of the Song dynasty of China. His original personal name was Zhao Zongshi but it was changed to &quot;Zhao Shu&quot; in 1062 by imperial decree. He reigned from 1063 to his death in 1067. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Emperor Shenzong.

==Family background==

Emperor Yingzong was the 13th son of Zhao Yunrang (趙允讓; 969–1059), who was a first cousin of Emperor Renzong and was posthumously known as &quot;Prince Anyi of Pu&quot; (). Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s grandfather, Zhao Yuanfen (趙元份; 966–1005), was a younger brother of Emperor Renzong&#x27;s father, Emperor Zhenzong, and was posthumously known as &quot;Prince Gongjing of Shang&quot; (). Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s mother, whose maiden family name was Ren (), was the concubine of Zhao Yunrang. She held the title &quot;&quot;Xianjun&quot; of Xianyou&quot; ().

== Early life ==
In 1055, Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s predecessor, Emperor Renzong, became critically ill and started to worry about having no successor because his sons all died prematurely. Acting on the advice of his ministers, Emperor Renzong agreed to bring two of his younger male relatives into his palace. One of them was the future Emperor Yingzong, who was eventually chosen and designated as the Crown Prince. Yingzong had his name changed to &quot;Zhao Shu&quot; in 1062 when he was officially designated as the Crown Prince. This name became his official name when he ascended the throne in the following year after his adoptive father Emperor Renzong died in 1063.

==Reign==

Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s empress consort was Empress Gao, a niece of Empress Dowager Cao who was the widow of Emperor Renzong. As Emperor Yingzong was severely sickly shortly after his coronation, Empress Dowager Cao served as his regent. However, Empress Dowager Cao held onto power even when Yingzong recovered until the Prime Minister Han Qi removed the screen from the audience hall making it impossible for Empress Dowager Cao to attend. She was forced to give power back to Yingzong.

Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s reign is known for controversy over the correct rituals to be performed by the emperor for his father. Emperor Yingzong had been adopted by Emperor Renzong, so Emperor Renzong was nominally Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s father. However, biologically, Zhao Yunrang was Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s father. Some officials suggested that Emperor Yingzong honour his biological father with the title &quot;Imperial Uncle&quot;, but the emperor agreed with Ouyang Xiu and others and decided to honour his biological father as his parent. This was not only an early sign of more conflict during Emperor Xiaozong&#x27;s reign but also the Great Rites Controversy of the Ming dynasty.

On April 7, 1063, Yingzong sent gifts including calligraphy made by Emperor Renzong to the Vietnamese King Ly Thanh Tong. Later, Than Thieu Thai raided Guangnan West Circuit prompting local officials to seek help from Yingzong but he ignored them leaving defences up to them although he branded Than Thieu Thai as &quot;reckless and mad.”

In 1065 AD, Emperor Yingzong ordered the great historian Sima Guang (1019–1086 AD) to lead with other scholars such as his chief assistants Liu Shu, Liu Ban and Fan Zuyu, the compilation of a universal history of China.

He died in 1067, caused by an illness that Yingzong contracted in 1066. He was succeeded by his son Zhao Xu who took the throne name Emperor Shenzong.

Emperor Yingzong had always been mentally ill, often distracted, physically weak, and depressed causing him to have health problems which contributed to his death at a young age.

<doc id="1150012" wikidata="Q787439" url="?curid=1150012" title="Automator (macOS)">
<text>Automator is an application developed by Apple Inc. for macOS, which can be used to automate repetitive tasks through point-and-click or drag and drop.

Automator enables the repetition of tasks across a wide variety of programs, including Finder, Safari, Calendar, Contacts and others. It can also work with third-party applications such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop or Pixelmator. The icon features a robot holding a pipe, a reference to pipelines, a computer science term for connected data workflows. Automator was first released with Mac OS X Tiger (10.4).

== Features ==
Automator documents are called &quot;workflows&quot;, and are made up of &quot;actions&quot;. Workflows are run sequentially, with each action being given the previous action&#x27;s output, which it can then process or act upon. Variables can be specified, which can be modified or processed by subsequent actions. Workflows can also incorporate loops and variables. Automator comes with a library of actions (file renaming, finding linked images, creating a new mail message, etc.). Actions can also run custom scripts, including AppleScript, JavaScript, or shell scripts. Workflow documents can be run directly in Automator or saved as applications that run the workflow when launched. Workflows can also be added to the contextual menu, to process any selected text or file.

, Microsoft has bundled Automator actions with Microsoft Office, which can be used to automate Outlook, Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Automator&#x27;s features:

* General
** Simulate the pressing of any key on the keyboard at specified intervals
** Run AppleScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby scripts, or shell scripts
** Create Folder Actions, a Finder feature that applies certain workflows to all files in a folder
** Create Services, which can be started in the Services menu
** Automator can integrate with iCal, to launch workflows at an iCal event&#x27;s specified time and date (and the event can be set to repeat automatically)
** Automator can also launch workflows with programmable voice commands (called Dictation Commands, added in OS X Yosemite)
* Internet
** Download webpages as PDF
** Extract an RSS feed from a given URL, and extract article text contents from that feed
** Compose new emails, with specified subject line and attachments (which can be an output from a previous Action)
** Upload files to FTP servers
* Multimedia
** Control USB-connected cameras to take pictures at regular intervals
** Perform Finder actions on images, including rotation, applying Quartz filters (like black &amp; white), and converting audio and video files to different formats
** Batch resize photos
** Import audio files to iTunes, and add them to playlists
** Play an iTunes playlist
* Text and documents
** Turn text files to audio files, using the Mac&#x27;s built-in text-to-speech feature
** Extract text from PDF files
** Combine PDF documents
** Extract annotations from PDFs
** Move files across folders, into folders, or out of subfolders
** Process strings text, including adding quotations around text or outputting word count
** Print files; and when combined with the &quot;Get Folder Contents&quot; action, it can print all files in a &quot;drop box&quot; folder

== Interface ==
Automator provides a graphical user interface for automating tasks without knowledge of programming or scripting languages. Tasks can be recorded as they are performed by the user or can be selected from a list. The output of the previous action can become the input to the next action.

The icon for Automator features a robot, known as Otto the Automator.

== History ==
Starting in macOS Monterey, Automator exists alongside Shortcuts.

<doc id="1150017" wikidata="Q4744393" url="?curid=1150017" title="American Management Systems">
<text>American Management Systems, Inc., was a high-technology and management consulting firm, founded in 1970 by a group of five former Defense Department officials who had worked under Robert McNamara in the Kennedy and Johnson administration. The company grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s, implementing key systems such as the accounting system for New York City and The Standard Procurement System for the United States Department of Defense. The company was acquired by Canada&#x27;s CGI Group in 2004, with AMS&#x27;s federal defense business being acquired by CACI.

==History==
AMS was founded in 1970 by five former Defense Department &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;: Charles Rossotti, Ivan Selin, Frank Nicolai, Patrick W. Gross, and Jan Lodal. The company&#x27;s initial headquarters were in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Arlington, Virginia. The founders drew upon research in attribute-value systems and early relational databases developed by Pentagon colleague Hugh Everett III, who served as a non-administrative vice president and minority partner in the firm for a time. From its inception, much of AMS&#x27;s revenue was derived from contracts with federal agencies. The company grew quickly during the 1970s. During its first decade of operation, AMS focused its business on consulting and selling customized software to large government and corporate organizations.

The company grew to over nine thousand employees, with many offices in both the United States and other countries. At one point in the 1990s, one quarter of the company&#x27;s revenue, albeit none of the profit, came from Europe. Much of its business centered on creating large computer systems for various government entities. It created a large accounting system for New York City during the city&#x27;s recovery from its fiscal crisis in the late 1970s, and won an award for the Defense Department&#x27;s Standard Procurement System in 1997.

In April 1993, AMS established an applied research lab called the AMS Center for Advanced Technologies (AMSCAT) at their headquarters facility in Fairfax, Virginia. Dr. Jerrold M. Grochow was appointed as the director of AMSCAT.

=== Telecom Practice ===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, American Management Systems was among the main telecom consulting companies in the United States. The company grew aggressively because of professional talent in the emerging Competitive Local Exchange Companies. As a result, AMS was a market leader to offer its telecom client Kenan&#x27;s Arbor-B/P, the award-winning convergence Billing Solution.

=== AMS in Europe ===

At the beginning of the 1990s, AMS provided the PRISM billing solution for the American cellular network operator PacTel Cellular, who later became AirTouch. Following the expansion of the GSM standard in Europe, AirTouch International invested in a number of foreign GSM providers. This led to the expansion of the AMS billing solution, re-branded as Spectrum 2000, into Europe. In 1992 AMS was in a unique position as provider of the billing system to the emerging mobile telco market in Europe, making AMS a major player in the European Market. AMS expanded into Portugal, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, and Poland. Despite this success, the company did not develop sufficient service delivery and business development units. Instead, it decided to commit to a huge (over 100M$) investment in the development of the sophisticated Customer Care and Billing System Tapestry for German fixed-wire telecom Arcor. Lack of commitment to marketing of this system contributed to the problems that led to significant layoffs in Europe in 2002. Furthermore AMS lost prestige when D2 chose Amdocs for its billing solution.

By 2002, AMS had approximately 6300 employees, 986 million in revenue and 21 million in income and 51 offices worldwide.

=== Lawsuits, divestiture, and sale ===
In 1999, the state government of Mississippi terminated an $11.2 million contract with AMS to modernize the state&#x27;s tax system and sued the company for $985 million in damages. A jury awarded the state $474.5 million in actual and punitive damages in August 2000, causing a drop in stock price from 44 3/8 to 14. The company subsequently settled the suit for $185 million.

Another customer, the Federal Thrift Investment Board, cancelled a contract in 2000 for a system to make Thrift Savings Plan data available online. The subsequent lawsuit was settled for $5 million in June 2003. A subsequent United States Senate investigation authored by senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman identified various reasons for four years of delays and cost overruns, including lack of formal agreement on a detailed design and problems with the structure of the contract.

In December 2002, AMS sold its Global Energy Group to Bangalore, India-based Wipro Technologies.

New CEO Alfred T. Mockett was hired by AMS in 2001 to grow the company&#x27;s sales from $1.1 billion to $3 billion a year, with a goal of becoming a top tier system integrator through growth and acquisitions, with an eventual goal of a &quot;big bang merger of equals.&quot; When this strategy proved unsuccessful, Mockett negotiated a sale of the firm. CGI, a Canadian company, was the primary purchaser, paying $858 million for the commercial business and all government business not related to national defense. The defense portion of AMS could not be sold to a foreign-based company so CACI purchased the defense and intelligence practice for $415 million. The sale to CGI and CACI was announced in March 2004. The AMS brand was retained by CGI for a time and the AMS website directed users to the CGI site. CGI&#x27;s United States headquarters are in Fairfax, Virginia.

==Location==
For the first 20 or more years of its existence, the company was based in Arlington, Virginia on the banks of the Potomac River with a commanding view of Washington DC. In the early 1990s, AMS moved its corporate headquarters to Fairfax, Virginia.

<text>Indian Larry (born Lawrence DeSmedt; April 28, 1949 – August 30, 2004) was an American motorcycle builder and artist, stunt rider, and biker. He first became known as Indian Larry in the 1980s when he was riding the streets of New York City on a chopped Indian motorcycle. Respected as an old school chopper builder, Larry sought greater acceptance of choppers being looked upon as an art form. He became interested in hot rods and motorcycles at an early age and was a fan of Von Dutch and Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth, whom he would later meet in California.

Wide acknowledgment of Indian Larry&#x27;s talent only came in the last few years of his life. He died in 2004 from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident while performing at a bike show. His bike, &quot;Grease Monkey&quot;, was featured in &quot;Easyriders&quot; magazine in September 1998. In 2001 Indian Larry participated in the Discovery Channel program &quot;Motorcycle Mania II&quot;, followed by three different &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; programs. During this period he and his team built the motorcycles, &quot;Daddy-O&quot; (known to most people as the &quot;Rat Fink&quot; bike), &quot;Wild Child&quot;, and &quot;Chain of Mystery&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Indian Larry was born Lawrence DeSmedt in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York on April 28, 1949. He grew up in the Newburgh, New York area including the town of New Windsor. The oldest of three children, with two younger sisters, Diane and Tina, Larry was described by his mother, Dorothy, as &quot;a good boy, but mischievous.&quot; Larry&#x27;s strict father, Augustine, was a carpenter at United States Military Academy and had built the family&#x27;s home. He wanted his son to follow in his footsteps in the carpentry trade. As a boy Larry liked Lincoln logs and Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth Revell plastic model kits. Roth, a legendary California artist and hot rod builder, was a big influence on Larry and his style would later bubble up to influence Indian Larry&#x27;s motorcycle designs.

Larry attended a Catholic elementary school where he suffered abuse. The nuns would hit his knuckles until they bled and lock him in dark closets. He kept what was occurring to himself, and didn&#x27;t tell his family what was going on. When his mother asked about his knuckles, Larry would always just say that he had gotten into a fight. It wasn&#x27;t until years later that his family learned what had actually happened. As a child Larry was described as being sensitive and artistic, and &quot;feeling more than most.&quot;

A well-known anecdote about Indian Larry is that as a kid he attempted to build a bomb in his parents&#x27; basement in order to blow up the Catholic school. The contraption exploded taking off the little finger of Larry&#x27;s left hand. Another version of the story states that the injury occurred while he was trying to build a skyrocket for the 4th of July. When asked about the experience of being maimed as a kid during a 2003 &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; program, Larry seemed to have come to peace with it:

As a youth Larry participated in the Boy Scouts. His scoutmaster, Gerald Doering, had raced Indian motorcycles which had an influence on Larry.

Larry&#x27;s first build was when he took his little sister Tina&#x27;s tricycle and equipped it with Schwinn bicycle handlebars and a lawn mower engine. According to a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that was mentioned in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Larry&#x27;s first motorcycle was a 1939 Harley Knucklehead that he bought when he was a teenager for a couple hundred dollars. &quot;Within hours, he had taken it apart, and it took him nine months to put it back together.&quot;

As a young man Larry learned how to weld from Conrad Stenglein in the Newburgh, New York area. The shop was simple. As Stenglein described it: &quot;All we had in the shop was a welding machine, torches, grinder, body putty, stuff like that.&quot; Quality of work was important to Larry early on. Stenglein said that &quot;Whatever part we made for a bike, it had to be strong and had to be good, that was our thing. It had to be perfect. If Larry put something on a bike that he didn&#x27;t like, he&#x27;d cut it off. That&#x27;s how he was.&quot;

A month before he was to graduate from high school, Larry told his mother that he was heading to California to join his younger sister Diane who was deeply immersed in the 1960s counterculture (Diane had run away from home when she was 16). In California Larry also took part in the scene and delved into drugs. Larry saw his sister Diane as a kindred spirit who understood what it was like to feel like an outsider in society. On June 21, 1971, Diane was murdered. Larry accompanied her body back to their hometown for her funeral. The experience was emotionally devastating to him.

Coupled with his grief, Larry was spiraling into drug addiction. To pay for the drugs he was robbing stores. The cops had an idea that it was Larry but had not been able to catch him so they set up a sting operation. In 1972 as Larry was exiting a bank he had just robbed, he was fired upon by two police officers. He narrowly escaped being killed when one of the bullets grazed his eyebrow. At the age of 23, Larry was sent to Sing Sing prison for three years. During his incarceration Larry earned his GED, and started taking courses in welding and mechanics. Prison was &quot;the place where he honed all his best mechanic skills.&quot; He also asked his mother to send him a dictionary and books on philosophy and other topics. He was released in September 1976.

==Move to New York City==
After completing parole, Larry relocated to New York City where he became involved with the underground scene. The first magazine article about Indian Larry was in &quot;Iron Horse Magazine&quot; in 1987. It featured his 1950 Indian Chief chopper with red-orange flames. It was during this period that people began to call him Indian Larry. In the 1980s he hung out with Robert Mapplethorpe and Andy Warhol. Mapplethorpe in particular was &quot;attracted to Indian Larry&#x27;s &#x27;crash and burn&#x27;&quot; lifestyle. One of the photographs that he took of Indian Larry ended up on the cover of &quot;Artforum&quot; magazine.

Indian Larry began working in different motorcycle shops in New York City and New Jersey during the 1980s and early 1990s. Often he would be rebuilding motors out of his apartment. For many years Larry struggled with alcohol abuse and heroin. In November 1991, during a period when he was living around the Bowery, Larry was going through severe withdrawals one night, wandering the streets cutting himself with a broken beer bottle. Larry would later say, &quot;I was homeless, shirtless, penniless, showerless...I had nothing. I had nothing left&quot;. According to Larry&#x27;s sister Tina, when a cop arrived on the scene shining a spotlight in Larry&#x27;s face, Larry told him, &quot;Just shoot me.&quot; They committed him to Bellevue Hospital. It was through Bellevue that Larry got connected up with a drug and alcohol program.

Larry had &quot;1991&quot; and &quot;1994&quot; tattooed on his arm, as he explained that he had to go back after his initial treatment. Larry struggled with a familiar cycle for years. As friend and bike building partner Paul Cox explained: &quot;...he would go through periods of time when he didn&#x27;t think he deserved fame or whatever, and would sabotage himself by doing drugs. Larry would attack himself internally and head down a self-destructive spiral.&quot; It was not until the late 1990s that Larry was finally able to free himself and stop using. Mentioning the long journey that it took, Larry expressed that he didn&#x27;t think that he could do it all over again. &quot;It was too hard,&quot; he said. Larry&#x27;s friend photographer Timothy White expressed, &quot;drugs didn&#x27;t belong with Larry and I think Larry knew that and it wasn&#x27;t until he got to a point that he really realized that – only at that point could he let it all go. And once he did, his life changed completely. It changed completely, like nobody I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

===Chopper builder===
Indian Larry, along with Paul Cox, Fritz &quot;Spritz by Fritz&quot; Schenck, Steg Von Heintz, and Frank, formed the crew at Psycho Cycles on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side beginning in the early 1990s. During this period they created a distinct New York City chopper style. In 2000, Larry and friends opened Gasoline Alley in Brooklyn.

Larry is credited with helping to re-popularize the stripped down, tall handlebar, foot clutched, jockey shifted, no front brake or fender, small gas tank, open piped, kick start only, stock rake choppers that prevailed in the 1960s, before long front ends became popular (Larry explained during his first &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot;, that he preferred nimbleness in a bike so he could ride at high speeds along the mountain switchbacks).

When building a chopper, Larry could draw upon what he had mastered over the years in the fields of mechanics, welding, and metal fabrication. Among custom bike builders, Indian Larry was known and respected for having mastered the old-school style of building and remaining loyal to it. Larry considered himself to be a &quot;gearhead&quot; originally, and was rooted in the hot rod culture of the 1950s and 1960s. During the &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; period in 2003–2004, Larry&#x27;s appreciation for modern horsepower and twin carburetors for increased fuel/air intake was expressed in his builds.

Larry explained, &quot;I&#x27;m a chopper builder. Old-time, old-school chopper builder. But I like the modern technology that&#x27;s involved. So the bikes run better, perform better. And we have more fun with them.&quot;

In the art of building a bike, Larry preferred old school methods and didn&#x27;t use CNC machines. He favored Paughco rigid frames and panhead motors. Larry liked being able to see all of the nuts and bolts and mechanics of a bike, rather than concealing those elements in a bike&#x27;s construction. The way that Larry approached building a bike was evident early on. The man who taught Larry the craft of using a welding torch said that he remembered Larry not wanting to grind down welds if they were good because Larry &quot;felt it showed your craftmanship.&quot;

Larry&#x27;s childhood friend, Ted Doering, who knew Larry when he was first learning to build and would chrome parts for him, said that Larry had even envisioned the idea for a &quot;&#x27;clear,&#x27; see-through transmission case&quot; in order to &quot;view the gears working&quot;. Doering added that Larry &quot;would fabricate or customize every piece because on a motorcycle, you can see everything.&quot;

Larry&#x27;s shop partner, Paul Cox, (who first met Larry at Sixth Street Specials in the East Village, and started working with him at Psycho Cycles around 1992) explained how Larry conceived the idea for a new chopper build: &quot;Working alongside him you realized how much he ran on instinct. Built-in instinct. He would rarely make a sketch or jot down notes...he just envisioned what he wanted in one wide-eyed flash and would turn to you with a look like he saw God. At that point it was &#x27;all over but the cryin,&#x27; he would say.&quot;

Indian Larry appeared in &quot;Easyriders&quot; magazine in 1998 in an article entitled, &quot;Hardcore NYC Troubadors&quot;. Later that same year the magazine profiled Larry with his motorcycle, &quot;Grease Monkey&quot;, which won the 1998 Editor&#x27;s Choice Award at the &quot;Easyriders&quot; Invitational Bike Show in Columbus, Ohio, which was an important recognition by the biker world of Larry&#x27;s talent.

The beginning of Indian Larry becoming known to the general public was his appearance in the Discovery Channel program, &quot;Motorcycle Mania II&quot; in 2001. The program&#x27;s primary focus was on customizer Jesse James, but it also featured different scenes profiling Indian Larry as he and the group (which included Jesse James, Chopper Dave, and Giuseppe Ronsin) set out to ride 1400 miles from Long Beach, California to the Sturgis 2001 Black Hills Classic in Sturgis, South Dakota. When one of the choppers breaks down in Southern Utah, Larry is shown performing his mechanical skills on the bike in a supermarket parking lot (when his own bike has magneto problems, Larry explains to the camera, &quot;If the bike is not running; if it&#x27;s leaking oil; and if it&#x27;s dirty. That&#x27;s about the only three things that will really get to me.&quot;) The program also shows Larry displaying his famous neck tattoo, sharing snippets of his personal philosophy, and doing riding stunts – this included him reclining back on his bike, &quot;Grease Monkey&quot;, with his legs outstretched over the handlebars, and standing up on the saddle with his arms outstretched to the side as he speeds down the highway. The group also visits Denver&#x27;s Choppers in Las Vegas, Nevada (now in Reno) where Larry is shown meeting chopper builder, Mondo Porras for the first time.

==&quot;Biker Build-Off&quot;==
Larry wanted to &quot;elevate the art of the motorcycle&quot; in the general perception and the art world. He stated, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is one of the highest art forms, because it combines all media: sculpture, painting, as well as the mechanics, and it&#x27;s just a lot more than any one single medium&quot; (In addition to metalwork and painting, Larry included engraving and leather work to the list in another interview). He explained that being a chopper builder requires being able to create from the abstract, and having a sense for aesthetics, while also possessing mechanical skills to deal with &quot;extremely critical tolerances...like 2/10,000 of an inch in the motors&quot;.

The &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; programs provided a public forum to do this. Indian Larry participated in three different &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; programs on the Discovery channel:
 The premise of each 45 minutes program was to profile two different custom motorcycle builders, each from a different part of the United States, and film them and their crews at work in their respective shops building a unique bike from start to finish within a set number of days. (They were given 30 days to build for Larry&#x27;s first two &quot;Biker Build-Offs&quot;, and 10 days for his third and final build for the program). The format seemed perfectly suited to Larry, as television viewers witnessed segments showing the culmination of years of bike building experience interspersed with Larry&#x27;s philosophical insights. Also shown helping Larry in the construction of each bike were Paul Cox and Keino Sasaki (pronounced &quot;cane-o&quot;) from his shop.

The bike builders would then meet at a neutral location and be filmed riding across several states to a particular bike show. The road trip was meant as a testing ground. Upon arrival at the bike shows, the general public in attendance could view the bikes and vote their preference between the two. Usually on the final day of a bike show, the votes would be tallied, a winner announced, and a trophy awarded. Indian Larry was voted the winner in all three &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; competitions that he competed in. His second trophy was cut up and shared with his opponent, Billy Lane and the audience, after Larry unexpectedly declared an exact draw after it was announced that he had won in the voting.

Indian Larry&#x27;s fatal motorcycle accident occurred during the filming of his third &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; in 2004, on the same day, and at the same bike show, where the votes were being tallied to determine the winner.

===Last build: &quot;Chain of Mystery&quot;===
Indian Larry and crew built the &quot;Chain of Mystery&quot; bike for the final challenge. Larry said that the original idea for the bike&#x27;s frame came to him in a flash of inspiration. He explained that his most creative ideas for a new build would flash across his mind in the form of an image, and then it would be his job to relentlessly chase that vision during a build until the image materialized in the finished product. &quot;Chain of Mystery&quot; utilized a frame concept that had never been done before. Using a jig as a guide, the heavy links of a chain, normally used for towing heavy vehicles, were welded together until the frame took shape (the shop&#x27;s Eddie Mcgarry was the project welder). Since the frame is essentially the spine of the bike, any weaknesses in the welds could prove fatal, especially considering that Larry really pushed his bikes to perform when riding them. As it turned out, the bike held up, and Larry rode the chopper to what would be his final bike show.

==Personal life==
Indian Larry considered himself a &quot;lone wolf&quot;, and was not a member of a motorcycle club, nor of what are termed outlaw motorcycle clubs. Larry loved being on the road on his bike and living the biker lifestyle.

When Indian Larry first met the woman that would become his wife, Andrea &quot;Bambi&quot; Cambridge, in 1996, her first impression of him is that she thought he looked like &quot;a total mass-murderer&quot;. People would go out of their way to avoid him on the subway, but the moment Larry would start talking he&#x27;d instantly put them at ease with his sense of humor.

Bambi relates in the biography, &quot;Indian Larry: Chopper Shaman&quot;, stories about how she first knew about Larry and the experiences that occurred before they came to be in a relationship. Before they officially started to date in 1997, they hung out together at a bar and Larry kept putting quarters in the jukebox, playing romantic songs by Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. This was when he was still drinking, and Bambi wrote that at one point he started crying, and said to her, &quot;No one else is ever really going to know my soul&quot;. And Bambi thought to herself, &quot;I will. I could do that.&quot;

Larry proposed to Bambi in the Bahamas. He surprised her by getting her name tattooed in circus letters on his chest. When he showed it to her he said, &quot;You know, you only have one girl&#x27;s name tattooed over your heart in a lifetime.&quot; They had a circus themed wedding at Coney Island (Coney Island was where they were both involved with the sideshow. She performed as &quot;Bambi the Mermaid&quot;, and Larry&#x27;s act involved lying on a bed of nails while large blocks of ice would be broken over his chest by a girl with a sledgehammer; or she would stand on his stomach. The experience performing in front of audiences helped prepare Larry for his later appearances on camera and performing at bike shows). Larry&#x27;s marriage to Bambi gave him a lot of strength, and gave him something to believe in.

===Philosophy===
Timothy White explained, &quot;Larry lived his art. There&#x27;s no doubt about it. His life was his art&quot;. Having experienced and overcome many extreme tests in life, Indian Larry adopted the question mark as his life logo. Larry &quot;had a lot going on in his head&quot;, and was by nature analytical, and a deep thinker. But ultimately he thought that one should just &quot;roll with the mystery&quot;, and &quot;live in the moment&quot;. Larry often expressed to those around him that he didn&#x27;t pretend to know what was going on. Basically applying the adage that wisdom is understanding what one doesn&#x27;t know. Larry explained:

One of Larry&#x27;s attributes that was well known to the public was his many tattoos, although he didn&#x27;t have most of his tattoos until later in life (he got his neck tattoo when he was in his mid 40s in the mid-1990s). The tattoo on his neck, which went across the front of his throat, was often commented on. The tattoo read:
The lettering of the middle two lines was in reverse so that it could be read in the mirror. Larry said that it was his way to remind himself not to judge others and that revenge was not his job. When asked about its meaning during the &quot;Motorcycle Mania II&quot; program in 2001, Larry explained with a big grin on his face, &quot;...it&#x27;s my philosophy. Go through life see what&#x27;s up. Try not to kill nobody!&quot; Larry often expressed his belief that life is &quot;a really precious, short gift.&quot;

==Film and television==
Indian Larry was involved with acting, and performed stunt work for films. He appears in the documentary, &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Red Glare!&quot;, and performed stunts for the films, &quot;Quiz Show, Muscle Machine, My Mother&#x27;s Dream, and 200 Cigarettes&quot;. He appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, among other appearances in film and television.

==Death==
In 2004, Indian Larry was living in the East Village with Bambi, working at his shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and was appearing at bike shows and rallies around the United States. He was regularly being recognized and approached by fans. When interviewed for the Discovery Channel in July 2004, Larry said, &quot;I just feel like that I&#x27;m maybe slightly starting to fit in somewhere and slightly starting to be accepted.&quot; His friend Timothy White said: &quot;It was finally making sense to him – all his turmoil, all his craziness...everything was just all coming together into this one moment of recognition that he was coming to...&quot;

In August 2004, Indian Larry and crew participated in the third &quot;Biker Build Off&quot; competition building the chain frame bike, &quot;Chain of Mystery&quot;. This time competing against Mondo Porras, whom he first met while filming &quot;Motorcycle Mania II&quot; in 2001 (Mondo, who began building choppers in 1967 with the late Denver Mullins in California, is known for his long down tube, stretch frame choppers. He and Larry had hung out together in Hawaii while appearing at a bike show there two months earlier). Both bike builders met in Pittsburgh, and then spent three days riding through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina to arrive at the Liquid Steel Classic and Custom Bike Series bike show in Concord, North Carolina, north of Charlotte. Larry was scheduled to perform stunts at the event the afternoon of August 28, 2004, such as riding through a tunnel-of-flames.

Larry was always careful to build his bikes with aligned geometry so that they did not veer to the side while riding down the road. One of the benefits derived from this level of bike stability is that it allowed Larry to perform his stunts on his own bikes, such as standing fully upright on the seat while speeding down the road. This is a stunt Larry had done countless times over the years. After standing up while balancing himself, Larry would then outstretch his arms in a &quot;T&quot; configuration, called a &quot;crucifix&quot; pose. Larry rode through the tunnel-of-flames that afternoon in front of a crowd of several thousand people. A short time later, Larry attempted to perform the standing stunt again, this time on his bike, &quot;Grease Monkey&quot;.

Larry had expressed apprehension that day about performing the stunt. Larry shared with Mondo that he did not have a good feeling about doing it, but he felt pressure to do it. Bambi said that normally Larry did this stunt after the bigger stunts as &quot;his way of blowing off steam...winding down.&quot; As Larry was performing the maneuver, something went wrong and the front end of his bike started to wobble. Rather than being able to jump down in the seat and regain control, Larry fell off the bike, hitting his head. Larry sustained serious head injuries and he was airlifted to the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. Indian Larry died from his injuries on Monday, August 30, 2004, at 3:30am. He was 55 years old. The last words that Larry uttered were to his wife Bambi (who was at the event) saying, &quot;Sweetie, sweetie.&quot;

==Legacy==
Fellow bike builder, Mondo said after Larry&#x27;s death, &quot;I think he humbled a lot of people because he was so real and genuine.&quot;

A tribute bike was built by Billy Lane, Keino Sasaki, Paul Cox, and Kendall Johnson in the Indian Larry shop which was filmed by Discovery Channel for a one-hour biography special on the life of Indian Larry. The name, &quot;Love Zombie&quot;, was chosen since this was a name that Larry had previously thought up for a future chopper he had wanted to build. Billy Lane hand-fabricated the gas tank, among the other contributions made by the team to build the bike (a vintage Pontiac car hood ornament of an Indian chief&#x27;s bust was incorporated into the design of the gas tank). Robert Pradke of Eastford, Connecticut applied purple paint with green flames.

Two books were published about Indian Larry in 2006: 
*&quot;Indian Larry: Chopper Shaman&quot; by Dave Nichols with Andrea &quot;Bambi&quot; Cambridge; photographs by Michael Lichter
*&quot;Indian Larry&quot; by photographer Timothy White

<text>The Nikon F-801 (sold as the N8008 in the US market) is a 35mm SLR released worldwide in June 1988 and manufactured until 1991, when it was replaced by the improved Nikon F-801s (N8008s in the US), which in turn was discontinued in early 1995. Although its autofocus mechanism is slow in comparison to modern standards, it was an improvement on Nikon&#x27;s first attempt at an autofocus SLR - the F-501 (N2020 in North America), and proved to be reliable and durable, typical of Nikon&#x27;s cameras.

==Features==
Despite being designated in the number range usually reserved for amateur cameras (indicated by the non-single digit after the F, eg. not F3), the F-801 was built to a high standard and incorporated a number of professional features:

* A Depth of Field preview button allows temporary stopping down to the shooting aperture to check DOF.
* A Multiple Exposure facility allows up to nine shots within one frame.
* A unique &#x27;two shot&#x27; self-timer. This allowed a second shot to be taken by the self-timer a couple of seconds after the first, giving a more &#x27;relaxed&#x27; and unposed picture.
* Fully programmed automatic exposure, Aperture priority, Shutter priority and fully manual exposure control.
* 30-second to 1/8000-second shutter speed range with bulb mode.
* Film-speed setting from DX code or by manual override (ISO 6 to 6400).
* 1/250-sec. flash synchronisation.
* Evaluative 2D Matrix and 75% Centre-Weighted Average metering modes.
* Compatibility with the Nikon Multi-Control Back MF-21, allowing freeze-focus, data imprinting, and automatic exposure bracketing.

==Compatibility==

Like the Nikon F4, the F-801 is broadly compatible with most Nikon AI and AF F-mount lenses, though some features are unavailable depending on the lens type. All features are available when used with AF-type lenses. Non-CPU (AI and AI-S) lenses are supported, but only Manual and Aperture-Priority exposure programs are available, using centre-weighted metering. Autofocus is not supported with AF-I and AF-S lenses, and Vibration Reduction (VR) is not available regardless of the lens. Newer G-type lenses are usable with the Program and Shutter-Priority exposure programs (though it is possible to use them in Manual or Aperture-Priority programs, but only at minimum aperture).

The F-801 continued the trend established by earlier Nikon cameras such as the F-301/N2000 and F-501/N2020 in not being provided with an ISO-standard cable release socket. Instead, all remote interaction with the camera is carried out via the two-pin remote terminal on the front of the body. One can use an ISO cable release with the body by purchasing a Terminal Release MR-3 and fitting it to the remote terminal.

Despite the camera&#x27;s complexity (900 parts, two microcomputers, and eight ICs), both the F-801 (N8008) and its successor the F-801s (N8008s) enjoy an enviable reputation for extremely reliable performance and durability, a weak point of many mid-level AF SLR cameras.

==Related models==
The F-801 provided a semi-professional autofocus successor to the manual-focus Nikon FE2 SLR, which had been manufactured until 1987. The success of the F-801 led to an updated version of this camera in 1991, which was designated the F-801S/N8008S. It had improved autofocus performance and incorporated spot metering, but retained the original model&#x27;s reputation for reliability.

During the early 1990s, the F-801s sat at the top of the company&#x27;s consumer range of autofocus cameras, which also included the F-401 and F-601. More advanced and expensive professional autofocus SLRs included the Nikon F4.

<text>Christopher Arthur Bruce Peacocke (born 22 May 1950) is a British philosopher known for his work in philosophy of mind and epistemology. His recent publications, in the field of epistemology, have defended a version of rationalism.

== Biography ==

Son of the British theologian and biochemist Arthur Peacocke, he was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read philosophy, politics and economics as an undergraduate, winning both the Webb Medley Prize in Economics and the Henry Wilde Prize in Philosophy in 1971, and graduated with a first class degree. Later that year, he was awarded a Kennedy Memorial Trust scholarship to study at Harvard University. He then continued at Oxford, gaining a BPhil (1974) and DPhil (1979) in philosophy, the latter under the supervision of Michael Dummett. He was visiting lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, 1975-6, and in 1975, elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He was the Susan Stebbing Professor of Philosophy at King&#x27;s College London from 1985 to 1989 and Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Oxford University from 1989 to 2000, at which time he moved to New York University (NYU). He joined the philosophy department at Columbia University in 2004, where he is now Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy. In 2007, he was named to the Richard Wollheim chair in philosophy at University College, London, where he taught in the third (summer) term each year until 2015. He lives with his wife and he has two adult children. He is also visiting professor of philosophy at New College of the Humanities.

== Philosophical work ==

Of his earlier work, he is perhaps best known for the first chapter of his 1983 book, &quot;Sense and Content&quot;, entitled &quot;Sensation and the Content of Experience.&quot; In this chapter, Peacocke defends the claim that perceptual experience, over and above its intentional content, has certain &quot;sensational properties&quot;. He gives three different examples of visual scenarios where intentional content alone cannot capture every aspect of the experience. Those aspects which elude intentional content are thought to be the sensational properties of the experience. Some of those who defend qualia have used these examples as evidence of their existence. Several philosophers have criticized these examples (Michael Tye, Fred Dretske), claiming that the supposed extra quality can indeed be captured in terms of intentional content.

In &quot;Sense and Content&quot;, Peacocke assumed that the intentional content of mental states is exclusively conceptual content, i.e. the content is such that the subject of the state needs to possess all the concepts that specify the intentional content in question. From about 1986 and onwards, Peacocke abandoned this assumption, arguing that some mental states, in particular perceptual experiences and representational states implicated in subpersonal information processing (for example, in the subconscious parsing of heard speech), have non-conceptual intentional content. Peacocke is now often seen as a leading proponent of this notion of non-conceptual intentional content.

In his 1992 book &quot;A Study of Concepts&quot;, Peacocke gives a detailed exposition of a philosophical theory of concept possession, according to which the nature and identity conditions for concepts may be given, in a non-circular way, by the conditions a thinker has to satisfy in order to possess the relevant concepts. The theory is a version of a so-called &quot;conceptual&quot; or &quot;inferential role&quot; theory of concepts.

<text>Abraham Kurkindolle Allison (December 10, 1814 – July 8, 1893) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the Florida Territorial Legislature and the Florida State House of Representatives as well as the sixth Governor of Florida at the end of the American Civil War.

== Early life ==
Allison was born on December 10, 1814, in Jones County, Georgia, to Captain James and Sarah Fannin Allison. After he graduated from school, he worked as a merchant in Columbus, Georgia, and in Henry County, Alabama. He then moved to Apalachicola, Florida, where he served as the city&#x27;s first mayor. He also served as the first county judge of Franklin County and as Clerk of the United States Court. He was a member of the Territorial Legislature. In the Seminole War, he was captain of the Franklin Rifles. He moved to Quincy, Gadsden County in 1839 and there commenced the practice of law.

In 1843, he built a Georgian colonial home in Quincy. In 1989 it became the Allison House Inn, a bed and breakfast.

== Early political career ==
He was again elected to the Territorial Legislature, and represented Gadsden County in the State Legislature in 1845, 1847 and 1852. As Speaker of the House, he assumed the duties of acting Governor on September 16, 1853, because both Governor Thomas Brown and Senate President R. J. Floyd were out of the state. He gave up the office on the inauguration of James E. Broome on October 3. Allison did not exercise executive powers and merely held himself in readiness should a need arise.

He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1861. He served during the Confederacy in the Florida State Senate from 1862 through 1864.

== Governorship and later life ==
After Governor John Milton died on April 1, 1865, either from an accident or suicide, Allison, as the state senate president, assumed the office of Governor. He resigned his office on May 19, 1865, and went into hiding the day before Federal troops formally occupied Tallahassee. He was captured by Union forces on June 19, 1865, and held for several months at Fort Pulaski.

After his release, he returned to Quincy to practice law. During the election of 1870, Allison led a band of armed men to block black voters from the polls until they closed. This nearly eliminated the Republican majority in Gadsden County. In 1872, he was convicted of &quot;intimidating Negroes&quot; for this incident and jailed for six months and fined.

He died in Quincy, Florida, on July 8, 1893, aged 78.

<text>The Regency Acts are Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed at various times, to provide a regent in the event of the reigning monarch being incapacitated or a minor (under the age of 18). Prior to 1937, Regency Acts were passed only when necessary to deal with a specific situation. In 1937, the Regency Act 1937 made general provision for a regent, and established the office of Counsellor of State, a number of whom would act on the monarch&#x27;s behalf when the monarch was temporarily absent from the realm or experiencing an illness that did not amount to legal incapacity. This act, as modified by the Regency Acts of 1943 and 1953, forms the main law relating to regency in the United Kingdom today.

An example of a pre-1937 Regency Act was the Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811 which allowed Prince George (later King George IV) to act as regent while his father, King George III, was incapacitated.

==History==
Prior to 1937, there was no permanent, general provision in British law for a regent to be appointed if the British monarch were incapacitated, a minor or absent from the country. Before the Glorious Revolution, it was up to the sovereign to decide who would be regent in any event although the decision was often implemented by legislation. For example, section XI of the Treason Act 1554 made King Philip, the husband and co-ruler of Queen Mary I, regent if Mary died and her heir was male and under 18 or an unmarried female under 15.

By the Act of Settlement 1701, Parliament passed the line of succession to Electress Sophia of Hanover. That decision was confirmed and extended to all of Great Britain by the Acts of Union 1707. With the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy firmly established in British law, it became possible for the British Parliament to pass legislation to determine who would act as regent during the absence, incapacity or minority of the ruling monarch. Since then, several Regency Acts have been passed.

===Regency Act 1705 and Succession to the Crown Act 1707===
With the passage of the Act of Settlement 1701 establishing the Protestant Succession and making Sophia of Hanover the heir presumptive to the throne, it became likely that upon Queen Anne&#x27;s death the country would be without a monarch in residence. The Regency Act 1705 was passed &quot;to put it [the succession] in such a method as was not to be resisted but by open force of arms and a public declaration for the Pretender&quot;.

The Act required privy counsellors and other officers in the event of Anne&#x27;s death, to proclaim as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and it was made high treason to fail to do so. If the next Protestant successor was abroad at the death of Anne, seven great Officers of State named in the Act and others whom the heir apparent thought fit to appoint, called &quot;Lords Justices&quot;, would form a regency. The heir would name these others through a secret instrument that would be sent to England in three copies and delivered to the Hanoverian Resident, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chancellor. The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662.

Two years later, after the union of Scotland and England, the new Parliament of Great Britain passed the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 to reaffirm the above procedure and modify it slightly. Under the Act, if the monarch died while the heir to the throne was overseas, the government would be run until the new monarch returned by between seven and fourteen &quot;Lords Justices&quot;. Seven of the Lords Justices were named in the Act, and the next monarch could appoint seven others, who would be named in writing, with three copies to be sent to the Privy Council in England.

The Act made it treason for any unauthorized person to open them or to neglect to deliver them to the Privy Council. The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.

Upon Anne&#x27;s death in 1714, the new king, George I, was in his home realm of Hanover. In accordance with the Succession to the Crown Act, Thomas Parker, Lord Chief Justice, became head of the regency. He served for a little over a month.

===Regency Act 1728===
The second act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain to deal exclusively with a regency was in 1728, the Regency During the King&#x27;s Absence Act 1728 (2 Geo. 2. c. 27). It specified that Queen Caroline would act as regent in the absence of her husband, King George II rather than their son Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom he despised. The act was necessary because George II was also the elector of Hanover and was returning to his homeland for a visit.

===Minority of Successor to Crown Act 1750===

In 1751, Prince Frederick died. That left Frederick&#x27;s eldest son, Prince George, as the new heir apparent. However, George was then only 12. If the King were to die before Prince George turned 18, the throne would pass to a minor.

That made Parliament provide for a regent by passing the Minority of Successor to Crown Act 1750 (24 Geo. 2. c. 24). The act provided that George&#x27;s mother, Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, would act as regent and specified that a Council of Regency be put in place to rule alongside Princess Augusta. The Council of Regency was to act as a brake on the regent&#x27;s power; some acts of the royal prerogative, such as declarations of war or the signing of peace treaties, would require a majority vote of the council. The provisions of the act actually never came into force since Prince George had already come of age by the time that his grandfather died.

===Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765===
In 1760, King George III ascended the throne, with his brother Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, as heir presumptive. However, the new King soon married and had several children. By 1765, the King had three infant children in the order of succession. Parliament again passed a Regency Act to provide for a regent in the event of the King&#x27;s death.

The Minority of Heir to the Crown Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. 27) provided that either the King&#x27;s wife, Queen Charlotte, or his mother, Princess Augusta, would act as regent. The Act also required the formation of a Council of Regency. As with the previous act, the provision of the new act actually never came into force since when George III died, his eldest son was already aged 57.

===Regency Bill 1789===
The Regency Bill 1789 was a proposed Act of Parliament to provide that George III&#x27;s eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, would act as regent because of the King&#x27;s incapacity caused by mental illness. With no legislation already in place, there was no legal basis for providing a regent, and the King was in no fit state to give royal assent to the Act. Parliament decided to have the Lord Chancellor, Lord Thurlow, approve the bill by fixing the Great Seal of the Realm to give royal assent. However, the King recovered in time before the bill could be passed. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, and others thought the Act to be illegal, but after his recovery, the King declared that the government had acted correctly.

The King&#x27;s continuing mental problems throughout the rest of his life confirmed the need for a suitable Regency Act to be in place. However, the King was hostile to the passing of such an Act while he was of sound mind.

===Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811===

In late 1810, King George III was once again overcome by mental illness after the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1789. Without the King&#x27;s consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners. Such letters patent were irregular because they did not bear the Royal Sign Manual, and only letters patent signed by the King himself could provide for the appointment of Lords Commissioners or for the granting of royal assent. However, because the King was already incapacitated &quot;de facto&quot;, resolutions by both Houses of Parliament approved the action and directed the Lord Chancellor to prepare the letters patent and to affix the Great Seal to them even without the signature of the monarch. The Lords Commissioners who were appointed in the name of the King signified the granting of the royal assent to a bill that became the Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811 (51 Geo. 3. c. 1). Under the Act, the King was suspended from the personal discharge of the royal functions, and George, Prince of Wales discharged those functions in the name and on behalf of the King from 1811 to 1820, when the King died and the Prince of Wales succeeded to the throne.

Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent, as the Prince of Wales became known. These constraints were in regards to appointments to certain offices, though they expired one year after the passage of the Act. The period from 1811 to 1820 is known as the Regency era.

The importance of this Regency Act was that it did not require a Council of Regency, as required by previous legislation. One reason was that the Prince Regent was heir apparent to the throne in any case and so would assume full powers upon his father&#x27;s death.

===Regency Act 1830===

In 1830, the throne passed to George IV&#x27;s younger brother (George III&#x27;s third son), King William IV. However, William IV had no surviving legitimate children. The heir presumptive to the throne was his niece, Princess Victoria of Kent, the 11-year-old daughter of William&#x27;s dead brother Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn.

As Parliament mistrusted the surviving younger sons of George III, the Regency Act 1830 (1 Will. 4. c. 2) placed any potential regency caused by the King&#x27;s death before Victoria had reached 18, in her mother, Victoria, Dowager Duchess of Kent. However, if Queen Adelaide gave birth to a child, that child would become king or queen instead of Victoria, and Adelaide would become regent.

If such a birth occurred after the King&#x27;s death, his child was to immediately succeed Victoria in Victoria&#x27;s lifetime as king or queen. The Act prohibited either monarch from marrying during the regency without the Regent&#x27;s consent and made it high treason to marry the monarch without such consent, or to assist in or be concerned in the marriage. The Act also prohibited the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne or to repeal or alter the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.

However, since Victoria became queen at 18, and Queen Adelaide had no more children, a regency was unnecessary and so the Act never came into force.

===Lords Justices Act 1837===

In 1837, Victoria succeeded her uncle at 18 while she was still unmarried and without children. The next in the line of succession was her uncle, the 66-year-old Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who succeeded King William IV in the Kingdom of Hanover. Ernest Augustus left the United Kingdom to take up his role in Hanover. That meant that until the Queen married and had legitimate children, the heir presumptive to the throne and his children would reside abroad. Although they would almost certainly return to the United Kingdom in the event of Victoria dying without having been survived by a legitimate child, that would take some weeks by using 19th-century transport.

To provide for the continuation of government in such an instance, Parliament passed the Lords Justices Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 72, long title: &quot;An Act to provide for the Appointment of Lords Justices in the Case of the next Successor to the Crown being out of the Realm at the Time of the Demise of Her Majesty&quot;). The act did not provide for a specific regent to be appointed, as it was expected that the new monarch would arrive in the country within a reasonable time. Thus the Act provided only for Lords Justices, including such people as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, to take up some of the monarch&#x27;s duties. Unlike the powers granted to prospective regents in previous legislation, the powers of the Lords Justice were more limited; for example, they could not dissolve Parliament or create peerages.

===Regency Act 1840===

By 1840, Queen Victoria had married her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and soon gave birth to Princess Victoria. It was expected that the Queen would have many other children; however, they would be in minority for at least the next 18 years, and Parliament again would have to provide for a regent in the event of Victoria&#x27;s death. The previous Lords Justices Act 1837 would not apply to the Queen&#x27;s children, as they resided in the UK. Parliament therefore passed the Regency Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 52), which provided for Prince Albert to rule as regent until the eldest son (or daughter, if no sons) reached the age of 18. The Act did not require a Regency Council to operate alongside Prince Albert, which potentially gave him more power than earlier proposed regents. The Act was fairly controversial at the time, as the British people were suspicious of Prince Albert, and he was generally unpopular in Parliament. However Victoria lived until 1901 (thus her surviving children were adults by then), and in any case, Albert predeceased her and so he did not become the regent.

The Act would have prohibited the monarch from marrying during the regency without written consent from the Regent and both houses of Parliament and made it high treason to marry the monarch without such consent, or to assist in or be concerned in the marriage. The Act also prohibited the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne or a bill to repeal or alter the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.

===Regency Act 1910===
In 1910 King Edward VII&#x27;s son, King George V, succeeded to the throne. However, his children were all under the age of 18. Therefore, Parliament passed the Regency Act 1910 (10 Edw. 7. &amp; 1 Geo. 5. c. 26) in 1910, that named the king&#x27;s consort, Queen Mary, as regent. No regency council was provided for, following the Regency Act 1840. Once again, the provisions of this act never came into operation, as the Prince of Wales was well over 18 by the time George V died.

==Acts currently in force governing the establishment of a regency==

The Acts currently in force governing the cases in which a Regency shall come into existence and when a regency shall cease, the determination of who shall be regent and the powers of such regent are the Regency Act 1937, the Regency Act 1943, and the Regency Act 1953, jointly referred to as the &quot;Regency Acts 1937 to 1953&quot;.

===Regency Act 1937===

In 1936, George VI (George V&#x27;s second son) became king, with his elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, as heir presumptive. However, Elizabeth was under the age of 18, leading to the need for a new regency act.

Rather than pass a specific regency act relating to the death or incapacity of George VI only, Parliament passed the Regency Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. 16), which provided for the incapacity or minority of all future monarchs. It also repealed the Lords Justices Act 1837, and established in statute the office of counsellor of state, to be appointed during the monarch&#x27;s absence abroad, or temporary illness not amounting to complete incapacity.

The Act ordered that a regent should perform the royal functions if &quot;the Sovereign is by reason of infirmity of mind or body incapable for the time being of performing the royal functions or that they are satisfied by evidence that the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions&quot;. Such a determination must be made by at least three of:

* the wife or husband of the Sovereign
* the Lord Chancellor
* the Speaker of the House of Commons
* the Lord Chief Justice of England
* the Master of the Rolls

The Act required that the regent should be the next person in the line of succession who was:

* over the age of 21
* a British subject domiciled in the United Kingdom
* capable of succeeding to the Crown under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701

The counsellors of state were to consist of:

* the monarch&#x27;s consort
* the next four people in the line of succession over the age of 21, excluding any person who is disqualified from being regent

Thus, at the time of the passing of the Act, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester would have become regent in the event that King George VI died while Princess Elizabeth was still a minor. The current prospective regent under the Act, who would assume the functions of regent should Charles III become incapacitated, would be his elder son William, Prince of Wales.

Section 4 of the Act prohibits the regent from giving royal assent to a bill to change the line of succession to the British throne or to repeal or alter the Scottish Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.

===Regency Act 1943===
The Regency Act 1943 (6 &amp; 7 Geo. 6. c. 42) modified the Regency Act 1937 so that counsellors of state who were absent during the Sovereign&#x27;s absence would not be listed among the appointments. It also declared that the heir-apparent or presumptive to the throne (first in the line of succession) only had to be 18 to be a counsellor.

===Regency Act 1953===

In 1952 King George VI died and was succeeded by his elder daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. With her eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Charles, under the age of 21, the Regency Act 1937 would provide for the next person over the age of 21 in the line of succession, the Queen&#x27;s sister Princess Margaret, to act as regent. However, although a regency was already provided for, Parliament made a new law creating a provision specific to the scenario of the succession to the throne of a son or daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, while still under the age of 18 years. That provision, which ceased to have any relevance in law once all children of Elizabeth and Philip reached adulthood, was to the effect that Prince Philip, if living, would act as regent in case of an underage succession to the Crown by one of the children born of his marriage to Queen Elizabeth II. Furthermore, if a regency was necessary during Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign, the Duke of Edinburgh would act as regent if the Queen had no eligible children or grandchildren.

At the bill&#x27;s second reading, David Maxwell-Fyfe, the Home Secretary, explained:

The Act also allowed the Queen&#x27;s mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to become a Counsellor of State again, a position she had lost on the death of her husband King George VI.

Most of the provisions of the Regency Act 1953 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 1) ceased to be applicable as the Queen&#x27;s children came of age. The sole provision of the 1953 Act that is still relevant is section 2, which reduced to 18 the age at which the heir-apparent or heir-presumptive to the throne could become Regent. This was done to remove the perceived anomaly that a person aged 18 could become a counsellor of state and could, upon accession to the throne, personally discharge the royal functions, but could not act as a regent until 21. In fact, this had been intended in 1937. In 1937, when the bill was still in committee, the attorney-general Donald Somervell had said:

There might well arise a case where the heir to the Throne was under 18 years of age and where it would be necessary to have a Regent, but that such Regent would only be a few months older. It would then be rather absurd to appoint as Regent someone only six months older than the King. Consequently ... there should be a minimum difference of three years.

===Counsellors of State Act 2022===
The Counsellors of State Act 2022 (c. 47) appointed Anne, Princess Royal and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (now Duke of Edinburgh) as additional Counsellors of State for their lifetimes, a position each had previously held but subsequently lost when Prince William and Prince Harry respectively reached the age of 21.

==Situations in which the royal functions are transferred to a regent==
According to the Regency Acts 1937 to 1953, presently in force, there is provision for the establishment of a regency either on account of the minority of the monarch or of the absolute incapacity of the monarch to discharge the royal functions.

===Regency in the case of the minority of the sovereign===
According to the Regency Acts in force, if the monarch is under the age of 18 years when he or she succeeds to the throne, a regency is automatically established, and, until the monarch attains the age of 18 years, the royal functions are discharged by the regent in the name and on behalf of the monarch.

In that case, any oaths or declarations required by statute to be taken by the sovereign on or after succeeding to the Crown are postponed until the sovereign&#x27;s personal assumption of the royal functions, and for the purpose of all such enactments regarding oaths and declarations that the new monarch must make upon accession &quot;the date on which the Sovereign attains the age of eighteen years shall be deemed to be the date of His Accession&quot;.

===Regency in the case of infirmity or unavailability===
Unlike any of the preceding Regency Acts, the Regency Act 1937 (which is still in force) established in law a procedure for determining the incapacity of the sovereign due to infirmity of mind or body or due to the monarch&#x27;s unavailability for another definite cause.

When a declaration of incapacity is made in accordance with the procedure set out in the Regency Act 1937 a regency is established and the royal functions are transferred from the sovereign to a regent, who discharges them in the name and on behalf of the monarch until a declaration is made in accordance with the said Act to the effect that the monarch&#x27;s incapacity has ceased.

====Declarations of incapacity and capacity====
According to section 2 of the Regency Act 1937, the people who can make a declaration of incapacity (or a declaration that the incapacity has ended) are the sovereign&#x27;s consort, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and the Master of the Rolls. these positions are held by, respectively, Queen Camilla, Shabana Mahmood, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Baroness Carr of Walton-on-the-Hill, and Sir Geoffrey Vos.

Any declaration of incapacity or of cessation of incapacity needs to be signed by three or more of them. Declarations based on the monarch&#x27;s unavailability for a definite cause need to be supported by evidence, and declarations attesting the sovereign&#x27;s incapacity by reason of infirmity of mind or body need to be supported by evidence including evidence provided by physicians.

A declaration of incapacity or of cessation of incapacity needs to be made to the Privy Council and communicated to the governments of the dominions.

==Incapacity of the Regent==

Under the Regency Act 1937, a declaration of incapacity can also be made with respect to the regent. Thus, if the person serving as regent becomes incapable of discharging the royal functions, either on account of an infirmity of mind or body, or because the regent has become, for a definite cause, unavailable to perform the said functions, then the spouse of the regent, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chief Justice of England and the Master of the Rolls) are empowered to make a declaration of incapacity regarding the regent.

The requirements for that declaration of incapacity are the same ones that are valid with regard to a declaration affecting the sovereign: the incapacity of the regent must be attested by evidence; in the case of infirmity that evidence shall include evidence provided by physicians; the declaration needs to be signed by at least three of the people empowered by law; and it needs to be lodged with the Privy Council.

Under section 3, subsection 5, of the Regency Act 1937, when the regent is the object of a declaration of incapacity, he or she ceases to be the regent, as if he or she were dead, and the person next in line capable of discharging the regency becomes regent in his or her place.

When a regent is removed from office by a declaration of incapacity and subsequently the incapacity ceases to exist, the regent can be restored to office by means of a declaration of cessation of incapacity. In that case upon the declaration of cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with the person who has a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the declaration of incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for declaration of cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a declaration of cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign.

==Assumption of office by the Regent: oaths to be taken before the Privy Council==
Whenever a regency is established, either on account of incapacity of the sovereign (duly declared in accordance with the procedure prescribed in statute), or on account of the minority of the Sovereign, and also when there is a change of regent, the new &quot;Regent shall, before he acts in or enters upon his office,&quot; take the oaths required by the Regency Act 1937; accordingly, a new regent only enters into the execution of his office by taking the oaths, and therefore cannot discharge any of the royal functions before taking them.

The oaths required to be taken by a new Regent upon his assumption of office are as follows:

The said oaths need to be taken and subscribed by the new Regent before the Privy Council, and the Regency Act, 1937 specifies that &quot;the Privy Council are empowered and required to administer those oaths and to enter them in the Council Books&quot;.

==Guardianship of the sovereign during a regency==
Unlike the situations of minor infirmity or of travel abroad that allow for the possible delegation of the royal functions by the monarch to counsellors of state (as authorised by section 6 of the Regency Act 1937), the establishment of a regency carries with it the notion that the sovereign is not fit and able to administer the affairs of his own person, so that he needs a legal guardian. The guardianship of the monarch, however, is not governed by the same ordinary body of laws that regulate the appointment of legal guardians to people in general. Instead of the legal guardian of the sovereign being appointed by a court based on the recommendations of the social services, the guardianship of the monarch is provided for directly by Regency Act 1937, presently in force.

Because the sovereign in his or her private capacity is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, the institution of a regency remains the sole method of placing the person of the sovereign under legal guardianship. And, according to the provisions of the Regency Acts in force, the creation of a regency to discharge the royal functions and the legal guardianship of the monarch go hand in hand: the monarch is only subject to legal guardianship when there is a regency, and always when there is a regency the monarch is placed under legal guardianship.

The legal guardianship of the person of the monarch (with the corresponding power to administer the private property of the sovereign) does not necessarily rest with the regent. However, if the none of the prospective guardians provided for in the statute exist, then, also according to the statute, the regent becomes the guardian of the sovereign. Accordingly, during a regency, the regent is the person invested with the royal authority, that discharges the royal functions on behalf of the monarch. The guardian, on the other hand, has the legal custody of the sovereign (who is either a minor or an incapacitated person) and the duty to care for the monarch&#x27;s personal well-being. The two roles may or may not be combined.

According to section 5 of the Regency Act 1937, if the monarch is under the age of eighteen years and unmarried, then his or her mother, if living, shall have the guardianship of the monarch&#x27;s person. On the other hand, if the sovereign is married, but is still under the age of eighteen years, or if the sovereign is a married adult, but has been declared incapable for the time being of performing the royal functions, then the wife or husband of the sovereign, if of full age, shall have the guardianship of the person of the monarch. In all other cases except the two situations described above (that is, if the sovereign is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, but his mother is no longer living; or if the sovereign is married, but the wife or husband is not of full age; or if the sovereign has been declared incapable of performing the royal functions, but does not have a wife or husband), then the regent shall be the legal guardian of the monarch and shall have custody of his or her person, and the property of the sovereign, except any private property which in accordance with the terms of any trust affecting it is to be administered by some other person, shall be administered by the regent.

==Current position==

===Regency===
, under the provisions of the Regency Acts in force, William, Prince of Wales, would become regent in the event of the incapacity of his father, King Charles III.

, the first person under the age of 18 in the line of succession to the throne is William&#x27;s eldest child Prince George of Wales, who is second in line to the throne after his father. If the prince were to succeed to the throne before his 18th birthday on 22 July 2031, his uncle, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (the King&#x27;s younger son), would serve as regent (if domiciled in the United Kingdom, as required by the 1937 Act), as George&#x27;s younger siblings Charlotte and Louis (currently third and fourth in line, respectively) would also be minors. In the event that Prince Harry would be unable to serve as regent (a possibility since his 2019 decision to take up residence in the United States), the next in line would be the King&#x27;s brother (Prince George&#x27;s grand-uncle) Prince Andrew, Duke of York, followed by the Duke of York&#x27;s elder daughter Princess Beatrice.

===Legal guardianship===
If the King were to be declared incapable of discharging the royal functions, the legal guardianship of the incapacitated monarch would be vested in his consort, Queen Camilla. If she were to be unable to carry out the duties of legal guardian, they would then revert to the sitting regent.

Prince George of Wales, should he ascend to the throne prior to his 18th birthday on 22 July 2031, would be the first person in the present line of succession who would require a regency and legal guardianship until he turned 18. According to the Regency Acts as currently in force, should this occur, his legal guardianship would be vested in his mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales. If she were to be unable to carry out the duties of legal guardian, they would then revert to the sitting regent.

<text>Echeveria is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, native to semi-desert areas of Central America, Mexico and northwestern South America.

==Description==
Echeveria plants are evergreen. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves. Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes. Often, numerous offsets are produced, and are commonly known as &quot;hen and chicks&quot;, which can also refer to other genera, such as &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, that are significantly different from &quot;Echeveria&quot;. 

Many species of &quot;Echeveria&quot; serve important environmental roles, such as those of host plants for butterflies. For example, the butterfly &quot;Callophrys xami&quot; uses several species of &quot;Echeveria&quot;, such as &quot;Echeveria gibbiflora&quot;, as suitable host plants. Even more, these plants are integral to the oviposition process of &quot;C. xami&quot; and some other butterfly species as well.

==Etymology==
&quot;Echeveria&quot; is named for Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy, a botanical illustrator who contributed to &quot;Flora Mexicana&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by A. P. de Candolle in 1828, and is named after the 18th century Mexican botanical artist Atanasio Echeverría y Godoy. , the genus consists of about 150 species, including genera such as &quot;Oliveranthus&quot; and &quot;Urbinia&quot; that have formerly been split off from &quot;Echeveria&quot;. 

Molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown the genus not to be monophyletic: species of &quot;Echeveria&quot; cluster with species of &quot;Cremnophila&quot;, &quot;Graptopetalum&quot;, &quot;Pachyphytum&quot;, and &quot;Thompsonella&quot; as well as species of &quot;Sedum&quot; sect. &quot;Pachysedum&quot;. The former &quot;Urbinia&quot; species do appear to form a monophyletic group within this grouping. Although it is clear that &quot;Echeveria&quot; is not monophyletic, its limits are not clear, and further analyses are needed to determine whether and how the genus should be split, or if it should be included in an expanded concept of &quot;Sedum&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Many &quot;Echeveria&quot; species are popular as ornamental garden plants. They are drought-resistant, although they do better with regular deep watering and fertilizing. Most will tolerate shade and some frost, although hybrids tend to be less tolerant. Most lose their lower leaves in winter; as a result, after a few years, the plants lose their compact appearance and need to be re-rooted or propagated. In addition, if not removed, the shed leaves may decay, harboring fungus that can then infect the plant.


===Propagation===
They can be propagated easily by separating offsets, but also by leaf cuttings, and by seed if they are not hybrids.

==Cultivars and Hybrids==
&quot;Echeveria&quot; has been extensively bred and hybridized. The following is a selection of available plants.

<text>June Rose Callwood, (June 2, 1924 – April 14, 2007) was a Canadian journalist, author and social activist. She garnered fame for her articles and columns written for national newspapers and magazines, including Maclean&#x27;s and Chatelaine. She solidified her name by founding charities focused on certain communities in Canada, including Nellie&#x27;s, one of Canada&#x27;s first shelters for women in crisis, Jessie&#x27;s Centre for Teenagers, now the June Callwood Centre for Women and Families, and Casey House, Canada&#x27;s first HIV/AIDS hospice.

== Childhood ==
Callwood was born in Chatham, Ontario, and grew up in nearby Belle River, with her younger sister Jane. Her mother was the daughter of a Métis bootlegger and her father was the son of a magistrate. Her parents&#x27; marriage was deeply troubled, and despite the affection shown to her by her grandparents, Callwood&#x27;s childhood was marked by adversity. They were desperately poor, moving at night from one house to another. Finally her childhood came to an abrupt end when her father left the family and she was forced to drop out of high school to earn an income.

==Career==
Callwood began her journalism career at her high school, Brantford Collegiate Institute, where she was editor of the school paper. She later worked for the &quot;Brantford Expositor&quot; as a cub reporter and received 50¢ per week for assorted writing and proofreading assignments. During this time, in the midst of World War II, June was earning $7.50 a week, half of which she gave to her mother for rent. In 1942, she was offered a job with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and moved to Toronto. She married journalist Trent Frayne two years later, but continued to use her own surname because &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; at that time did not employ married women.

Callwood left &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; to raise a family but later resumed her career by becoming a freelance journalist, writing books and magazine pieces, many for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. In the spring of 1957, she interviewed Elvis Presley in Toronto, during the singer&#x27;s first tour of Canada. Soon after, she ghost-wrote autobiographies for such prominent Americans as broadcaster Barbara Walters, film director Otto Preminger and Dr. Charles William Mayo. Frayne and Callwood also hosted the CBC Television talk show &quot;&quot; in the 1954-55 television season.

Callwood later entered television journalism, hosting the series &quot;In Touch&quot; on CBC Television from 1975 to 1978. She also hosted two series, &quot;National Treasure&quot; and &quot;Caregiving with June Callwood&quot;, for Vision TV.

Callwood&#x27;s career was marked by a strong concern for social justice, especially on issues affecting children and women. She became one of Canada&#x27;s most famous social justice activists, founding or co-founding over 50 Canadian social action organizations including youth and women&#x27;s hostels. She founded Casey House (a Toronto hospice for people with AIDS), Jessie&#x27;s (now called Jessie&#x27;s: The June Callwood Centre for Young Women), PEN Canada, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and Feminists Against Censorship.

In 2004, Callwood went public about her battle with cancer. She refused treatment and continued to be active until she succumbed to the disease in the morning of April 14, 2007. Callwood was last seen on TV on April 2, 2007, in the CBC show &quot;The Hour&quot;, interviewed by George Stroumboulopoulos.

A biography, written by Anne Dublin and entitled &quot;June Callwood: A Life of Action&quot;, was published in March 2007.

== Activism ==
Charities and organizations group which Callwood founded or helped to found include:

* Digger House (established in the 1960s), a shelter for homeless youth
* Nellie&#x27;s (1974), one of Canada&#x27;s first shelters for women in crisis
* Jessie&#x27;s Centre (1982), a centre for pregnant teens and young mothers
*Casey House (1988) a residence for patients with HIV/AIDS. At the beginning of its establishment, Casey House was the first hospice in the world to provide support and palliative care for people with HIV/AIDS.
* Founder member, PEN Canada and Maggie&#x27;s Toronto Prostitutes&#x27; Community Service Project 
* Co-founder, Canadian Civil Liberties Association and Feminists Against Censorship

==Honours==
In 1978, Callwood was made a member of the Order of Canada. She was promoted to Officer in 1985, and promoted again to Companion in 2000. In 1988, she was awarded the Order of Ontario. She was inducted into the Etobicoke Hall of Fame in 1992.

In 2004, the City of Toronto noted its intention to name a street in Callwood&#x27;s honour. Callwood requested that an existing street not be renamed for her, and specified that it be a new or currently unnamed street near a school or a playground. June Callwood Way is in the neighbourhood of Queen Street East and Broadview Avenue.

June Callwood was named Toronto Humanist of the Year 2004 by The Humanist Association of Toronto. This yearly honour is presented by H.A.T. to men and women who, in their actions, and creative endeavours, exemplify the principles of Humanism: a commitment to reason, compassion, ethics and human dignity.

In July 2005, a Toronto park was named after Callwood. A professorship in social justice was also established at Victoria College, University of Toronto in her honour. In 2008, Premier Dalton McGuinty declared June 2 of every year to be June Callwood Day.

In 2011, June Rose Callwood Public School, located at 84 Edward Street in St. Thomas, Ontario, was named in her honour.

==Personal life==
Callwood and Frayne had four children together: two daughters and two sons. The daughters are noted authors Jesse and Jill Frayne, and the elder son is Brant Frayne. The second son and youngest child, Casey Frayne, was killed on April 19, 1982, when he was 20 years old, by a drunk driver on Highway 401 as he returned home from Queen&#x27;s University. This tragedy incited her neighbour John Bates to start a campaign against drunk driving, which resulted in the founding of Citizens Against Impaired Driving (CAID) which is now MADD Canada, the Canadian branch of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Callwood&#x27;s own death came only days before the 25th anniversary of her son&#x27;s death.

Despite Callwood&#x27;s accomplished activism career, she faced obstacles that attacked her public image. In 1968 she was arrested and briefly spent time in the Don Jail after siding with homeless Yorkville children in a battle with police. But her most painful passage was in 1991, while on the board at Nellie&#x27;s, when a number of women she considered friends failed to stand up for her in the face of allegations of racism. &quot;Nobody asked what happened,&quot; says Callwood, &quot;you didn&#x27;t have to do anything in those days. You just had to be in the way of legitimate rage. It woke people up...but a few of us got our heads kicked in.&quot; 

Callwood eventually returned to work despite the damage done to her reputation, focusing most particularly on being spokesperson for the Campaign Against Child Poverty. During this low period of forced withdrawal from the public, at age 70 Callwood obtained her pilot&#x27;s licence and maintained the licence throughout her life. &quot;I wanted something to get above the muck and I guess I did it more literally than most people&quot;, she said. Callwood was known to laugh at the irony of all the accolades awarded her, a high-school dropout &quot;with a criminal record&quot;, as she would quickly add.

Callwood generally shied away from organized religion. &quot;I am missing a formal religion, but I am not without a theology, and my theology is that kindness is a divinity in motion,&quot; she said in a 2005 speech delivered as the first lecture in the June Callwood Professorship in Social Justice at Victoria College at the University of Toronto.

<doc id="1150067" wikidata="Q1291023" url="?curid=1150067" title="Eduardo Hurtado">
<text>Eduardo Estíguar Hurtado Roa (born 2 December 1969) is an Ecuadorian former footballer who played as a striker. He is the 3rd all-time top goalscorer for the Ecuador national football team with 26 goals in 74 caps. He has played for teams in his home nation as well as Mexico, the United States, Scotland, Switzerland, Chile and Argentina. In America&#x27;s Major League Soccer (MLS), he was the second highest goal scorer in the league&#x27;s opening season, helping the Los Angeles Galaxy make a run for the playoffs. He was active for nearly 20 years, retiring at 40 years old in 2010.

==Career==
Hurtado, nicknamed &quot;El Tanque&quot; (&quot;The Tank&quot;) for his towering frame and his aggressive playing style (trying to roll over everything in his path), has played for many teams in different countries. His first teams were now defunct Valdez Sporting Club from Milagro and Emelec from Guayaquil, in his native Ecuador. He also had stops in Switzerland, Chile, Mexico, the United States, Argentina, and Scotland. He later returned to Ecuador.

===Major League Soccer===
Hurtado was one of the early stars of Major League Soccer (MLS). In 1996, the league&#x27;s first year, he finished second in goals, scoring 21 for the Los Angeles Galaxy. He scored three goals in the playoffs as the Galaxy fell short in the MLS Cup final and he was named to the MLS Best XI at the end of the season. After only scoring eight goals in 1997, Hurtado was traded to the MetroStars after two games into the 1998 season and finished the year with 11 goals and 15 assists (10 and 14 of those for the Metros), plus a goal in the playoffs.

After scoring two goals in the Metro season opener in 1999, Hurtado scored just five goals throughout the rest of the season. Playing for one of the worst teams in league history, he was criticized for missing easy goalscoring chances game after game. El Tanque became known as &quot;El Tanque&quot;, and the Metros let him go on waivers after the season. The New England Revolution picked him up, but he only lasted three goalless games there before getting released.

===Post-MLS Career===
Since his departure from MLS, Hurtado played for Liga Deportiva Universitaria, Argentinos Juniors, and then Hibernian, where he joined international teammate Ulises De La Cruz. Hurtado&#x27;s spell with Hibernian was an unhappy one, as he was signed by Alex McLeish, who soon left the club to join Rangers. Hurtado was ineffective and was given a free transfer by Bobby Williamson.

He then played for Barcelona S.C., El Nacional, the team of Universidad de Concepción, and Audaz Octubrino from Machala. In 2004, he came back to the United States to play indoor soccer, signing with the Cleveland Force of the MISL in December. However, he couldn&#x27;t adjust to the indoor game and was released in less than a month, returning to Ecuador to play for Olmedo. In 2006, he played for the 2nd Division club C.S. Norte América.

He surprisingly announced that he would transfer to Colombian football to sign for the 1st Division Club Deportivo Pereira. The Recordman said: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m 20 years old, I want to score in Colombia&quot; in an interview with a local TV.

In 2008, he played in San Camilo of the Ecuadorian Second Division.

Finally, he decided to play his final season at 40 years old with the oldest team in Ecuador, Club Sport Patria, in the Second Division.

==Honors==

===Nation===
** Canada Cup: 1999
** Korea Cup: 1995

===Individual===

<doc id="1150068" wikidata="Q272382" url="?curid=1150068" title="Kimya Dawson">
<text>Kimya Dawson (born November 17, 1972) is an American folk singer-songwriter, one half of the anti-folk duo the Moldy Peaches. Dawson&#x27;s work with the Moldy Peaches earned them a cult following and critical acclaim, with their 2001 song &quot;Anyone Else but You&quot; landing a spot in multiple acclaimed indie film soundtracks. &quot;Anyone Else but You&quot; as performed by Michael Cera and Elliot Page charted on the Billboard Hot 100 after its prominent inclusion in the 2007 film &quot;Juno&quot;, the soundtrack of which includes several songs by Dawson and her associated musical acts. The song remains Dawson&#x27;s highest charting single to date. In addition to their work with the Moldy Peaches, Dawson has released seven solo studio albums and collaborated with various other artists from a diverse range of genres, including Aesop Rock, They Might Be Giants, The Mountain Goats, and Third Eye Blind.

==Career==
Dawson became well known as co-founder of the Moldy Peaches alongside Adam Green. Since the Moldy Peaches went on hiatus in 2004 Dawson has released a string of lo-fi homemade albums and toured widely in North America and Europe. Dawson&#x27;s children&#x27;s album, &quot;Alphabutt&quot;, was released on September 10, 2008. Song titles include &quot;The Alphabutt Song,&quot; &quot;Seven Hungry Tigers,&quot; &quot;Little Monster Babies,&quot; &quot;Wiggle My Tooth&quot; and &quot;Pee Pee in the Potty,&quot; and collaborators include former Third Eye Blind guitarist Kevin Cadogan and a number of Dawson&#x27;s other musical friends and their children. She has also been invited to participate in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television program.

In September 2012, they appeared in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s book.

==Soundtrack work==
Dawson&#x27;s songs are featured in the films &quot;The Guatemalan Handshake&quot; and &quot;Glue&quot;, both of which were shown at the Olympia Film Festival in November 2007.

In 2008, Dawson contributed the song &quot;Anthrax&quot;—about 9/11—to the soundtrack of the &quot;Body of War&quot; documentary.

&quot;Anyone Else But You&quot;, a song they recorded with the Moldy Peaches, was used in the documentary &quot;Murderball&quot;, about a team of wheelchair rugby players. This song was also used in the film &quot;Juno&quot;. The melody of this song, with new lyrics, was used in a commercial for Atlantis.com.

Critics warmly received the music in &quot;Juno&quot;, where Dawson&#x27;s &quot;sweetly melancholic acoustic-strummed tunes&quot; helped define the character of a pregnant young teenager who decides to have her baby. Dawson helped choose many of the songs for the &quot;Juno&quot; film, helping to set the film&#x27;s mood. The soundtrack was voted by &quot;NPR&quot; listeners as the 14th best of the year in a listener poll for 2008. Dawson sings about diverse topics:

Dawson&#x27;s authentic persona has a demeanor which is &quot;sheepish and guileless and awkward in a way that you really can&#x27;t fake&quot; and who sometimes looks &quot;legitimately terrified&quot; during performances, according to &quot;Village Voice&quot; music critic Rob Harvilla.

Five of Dawson&#x27;s solo songs, two from Antsy Pants, as well as one from the Moldy Peaches, are included on the &quot;Juno&quot; soundtrack, released in December 2007. Composer Mateo Messina also based the film&#x27;s score on Dawson&#x27;s music.

The soundtrack album, after two weeks topping Billboard&#x27;s Digital Albums chart, reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, in its first week of release. In its first full week of physical release the album sold 68,000 copies, reaching No. 3 on the Soundscan album chart. It missed out on the No. 1 spot by only 2,600 copies. The following week it jumped to #2, while selling 15% fewer copies (58,000), just 2,000 copies behind first place. In the album&#x27;s third week of physical release it finally made the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 and Soundscan charts, selling 65,000 copies. The soundtrack for Juno won a Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack in 2009, beating out American Gangster, August Rush, Mamma Mia and Sweeney Todd.

Two songs were also included in the soundtrack to &quot;Unmade Beds&quot;.

==Other collaborations==

Dawson performs on recordings by Ben Kweller, They Might Be Giants, the Mountain Goats, John Wayne Shot Me, Your Heart Breaks, and the Terrordactyls.

The Third Eye Blind track &quot;Self-Righteous&quot; on their album &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; features a duet with Dawson and Third Eye Blind&#x27;s lead singer Stephan Jenkins. Dawson also appears on the Third Eye Blind album, Ursa Major, on the track &quot;Why Can&#x27;t You Be&quot;. This song was available as a bonus track on the iTunes Store download.

Regina Spektor collaborated with Dawson on the song &quot;Fire&quot; on the &quot;Hidden Vagenda&quot; album. Dawson also collaborated with fellow antifolk Jeffrey Lewis. They made a band called &#x27;The Bundles,&#x27; with Jack Lewis and drummer, Anders Griffen, though released the songs under the name &quot;Kimya Dawson and Jeffrey Lewis&quot;, on a split with Jeffrey Lewis and Diane Cluck.

Under the name Geniusis, Dawson released the free album &quot;Holiday Rampage&quot; alongside Aesop Rock, Johnny Druelinger, Jason Carmer and Quinn Tuffinuff.

In February 2011, Dawson recorded a Daytrotter session with Aesop Rock, in which they performed three songs together. This session was later released in May 2011.

Dawson released the solo album &quot;Thunder Thighs&quot; in October 2011. The album features guest performances by Aesop Rock, John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats, Nikolai Fraiture of the Strokes, Forever Young Senior Citizen Rock &amp; Roll Choir, Olympia Free Choir, Quinn Tuffinuff, Daniel Bryan, Dawson&#x27;s child Panda and more.

They have performed numerous times with Paul Baribeau, whom they references several times in their songs.

Dawson played &quot;An Evening of Awesome at Carnegie Hall&quot; with John Green and Hank Green on January 15, 2013.

On February 11, 2013, Dawson and Aesop Rock released their first music video as The Uncluded on YouTube, a single titled &quot;Earthquake.&quot; Their debut album &quot;Hokey Fright&quot; was released on May 7, 2013. The video for their third single &quot;Delicate Cycle&quot; has a cameo of Lil Bub.

==Personal life==
On Christmas Day in Port Townsend, Washington in 1998, Dawson accidentally overdosed on whiskey and prescription pills. Dawson suffered a grand mal seizure and vomited blood, which they then inhaled. To the surprise of their doctors, Dawson woke up from a coma in a hospital the next day.

Dawson moved to Bedford Hills, New York, in December 2005. In 2006, Dawson married musician Angelo Spencer. In July 2006, Dawson gave birth to a child, Panda, and in November 2006 moved the new family to Olympia, Washington.

Dawson is good friends with AEW wrestler Bryan Danielson (aka Daniel Bryan), who appears as a guest artist on the &quot;Thunder Thighs&quot; track &quot;Captain Lou&quot;, written in homage to wrestling manager Lou Albano.

Prior to 2007, Dawson once joked that they are a cousin of The Strokes&#x27; drummer Fabrizio Moretti. From the joke started a myth that they are actually cousins.

In late 2019, Dawson disclosed on social media that they had been impacted by gender dysphoria and stated their pronouns as &quot;she/they/grandpa&quot;. They had previously referred to themself as &quot;Grandpa Kimya&quot; on Twitter as early as 2012. The following January, in a tweet addressing &quot;bullies&quot; on posts in the #IAmNonbinary hashtag, Dawson wrote that &quot;things might have been very different&quot; for them growing up if they &quot;had known words like &#x27;gender fluid&#x27; and &#x27;nonbinary&#x27; and that language had been normalized by my peers and role models.&quot;

<text>Doberlug-Kirchhain ( ; Polish: &quot;Dobryług&quot;) is a German town in the district of Elbe-Elster, Lower Lusatia, Brandenburg. 

==History==
937. The town of Kirchhain was built by Margrave Gero. A document written in 1005 mentions the town Doberlug (&quot;Dobraluh&quot;) for the first time. In 1165 the Cistercian Dobrilugk Abbey was founded by Margrave Dietrich of Landsberg.

1235. Kirchhain received market-rights. In 1431 the Hussites destroyed the town of Doberlug and the abbey was devastated. In 1637 and 1643 the Swedes destroyed Kirchhain.

From 1815 to 1947, Doberlug and Kirchhain were part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg.

1848. The jurisdictions of Doberlug and Kirchhain were unified, but the actual merger of the two towns did not take place until over one hundred years later, in 1950.

During World War II, Kirchhain was taken by the Red Army on 23 April 1945.

From 1952 to 1990, Doberlug-Kirchhain was part of the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany.

On August 28, 1992, the &quot;Amt Doberlug-Kirchhain&quot; was created to streamline the administration of the town together with the surrounding 8 small municipalities. Nexdorf and Frankena later joined as well. The municipalities incorporated into the town were Frankena (2000), Dübrichen, Hennersdorf, Nexdorf, Prießen and Werenzhain (2001), and Buchhain (2002). The remaining three municipalities Arenzhain, Trebbus and Lugau were incorporated on October 26, 2003, thus ending the history of the &quot;Amt&quot;.

== Demography ==


==Climate==

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the town shows the town hall with three towers topped with yellow flags. Below is a green ring. On top are two clouds and rays of the sun. The shield is blue, and shaped like a leather sheet, symbolizing the history of the city as a tannery center. The coat of arms was created in 1950 by combining the symbols of the coats of arms of Doberlug and Kirchhain: the green ring and the sun are taken from the arms of Doberlug, while the town hall is from those of Kirchhain.

==Twin towns==
Doberlug-Kirchhain is twinned with Hemer in North Rhine-Westphalia and Kirchhain in Hesse.

<doc id="1150075" wikidata="Q2046325" url="?curid=1150075" title="Round barrow">
<text>A round barrow is a type of tumulus and is one of the most common types of archaeological monuments. Although concentrated in Europe, they are found in many parts of the world, probably because of their simple construction and universal purpose.

In Britain, most of them were built between 2200BC and 1100BC. This was the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age. Later Iron Age barrows were mostly different, and sometimes square.

== Description ==
At its simplest, a round barrow is a hemispherical mound of earth and/or stone raised over a burial placed in the middle. Beyond this there are numerous variations which may employ surrounding ditches, stone kerbs or flat berms between ditch and mound. Construction methods range from a single creation process of heaped material to a complex depositional sequence involving alternating layers of stone, soil and turf with timbers or used to help hold the structure together.

The center may be placed a stone chamber or cist or in a cut grave. Both intact inhumations and cremations placed in vessels can be found.

Many round barrows attract surrounding satellite burials or later ones inserted into the mound itself. In some cases these occur hundreds or even thousands of years after the original barrow was built and were placed by entirely different cultures.

Numerous subtypes include the bell barrow, bowl barrow, saucer barrow and disc barrow.

== Examples ==

=== Scandinavia ===

==== Denmark ====
Denmark has many tumuli, including round barrows. The round barrows here were built over a very broad span of time and culture, from the Neolithic Stone Age to the Viking Age. They show a large variation of construction design while sharing a common exterior look. Tumuli were protected by law in 1937.

=== Britain ===
In Britain round barrows generally date to the Early Bronze Age although Neolithic examples are also known. Later round barrows were also sometimes used by Roman, Viking and Saxon societies. Examples include Rillaton barrow and Round Loaf. Where several contemporary round barrows are grouped together, the area is referred to as a &quot;barrow cemetery&quot;.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in Peru. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. 

==Introduction==
Liberalism began with the Progressive Club in 1850, which was the first political party to be organised in Peru. The Progressive Club, led by Domingo Elías, published its own weekly magazine &quot;The Progress&quot;.

*1955: Pedro Roselló changed the name of the party to Liberal Coalition.
*1962: Pedro Beltrán changed the name of the party to Liberal Movement.

<text>Latheronwheel () is a small village in Caithness, in the Highland area of Scotland. It is southwest of Lybster on the A9 road to Helmsdale, near the junction with the A99 road to Wick, which lies in the equally small village of Latheron.

The village is at the mouth of a wide valley, through which flows a small river called the Burn of Latheronwheel.

It was built on the land of one Captain Dunbar (who had actually wished for it to be called Janetston, after his wife). It was a planned settlement, begun in 1835 with the building of a hotel (then known as &#x27;Dunbar&#x27;s Hotel&#x27; but today as &#x27;The Blends&#x27; - due to its proprietor in the 1890s penchant for blending whisky from stills of dubious legality). In the beginning, tenants of the settlement were allocated and the right to fish from the harbour.

The harbour was constructed around 1840, with a small lighthouse (soon disused) built on the southern headland. At one time was the home of 50 boats although few now remain. Initially salmon was caught, but this gave way to herring. As the herring trade became more concentrated in larger ports in the years before the First World War, the catch and the number of vessels in use in Latheronwheel declined.

The village is home to the four star Craiglea holiday complex which includes a swimming pool, something unique to this area of Scotland.

<doc id="1150093" wikidata="Q191415" url="?curid=1150093" title="Asnières-sur-Seine">
<text>Asnières-sur-Seine () is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department and Île-de-France region of north-central France. It lies on the left bank of the river Seine, some eight kilometres from the centre of Paris in the north-western suburbs of the French capital. The area should be reached by line 15 of the Paris metro by 2030. The inhabitants are called the &quot;Asniérois&quot; and the &quot;Asniéroises&quot; in French.

==Name==

Asnières-sur-Seine was originally known simply as Asnières. The name was recorded for the first time in a papal bull of 1158 – as &quot;Asnerias&quot;, from Medieval Latin &quot;asinaria&quot;, meaning &quot;donkey farm&quot;. The poor soil of Asnières, where heather grew in medieval times, was probably deemed suitable only for the breeding of donkeys. By the early 20th century it had become a favourite boating centre for Parisians, and its industries included boat building.

On 15 February 1968 the commune was officially renamed Asnières-sur-Seine to distinguish it from other French communes also called Asnières.
==Demographics==

===Immigration===
==Departmental representation==
The commune is divided between two cantons (departmental constituencies):
*Asnières-sur-Seine: composed of part of the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Currently represented by Josiane Fischer (UDI) and André Mancipoz (LR).
*Courbevoie-1: composed of part of the commune of Courbevoie and of the remainder of the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Currently represented by Daniel Courtès (LR) and Marie-Pierre Limoge (UDI).

==Economy==
Lesieur – a major producer of cooking and table oils and part of the Avril Group – has its headquarters in Asnières.

==Education==
===Public schools===
(fully financed by the commune, department, or region):
* 20 kindergarten / nursery schools (&quot;écoles maternelles&quot;);
* 16 elementary / primary schools (&quot;écoles élémentaires&quot;);
* 4 junior high schools: the Collège André Malraux, the Collège Auguste Renoir, the Collège François Truffaut, and the Collège Voltaire;
* 3 senior high schools: the Lycée d&#x27;enseignement adapté Martin Luther King, the Lycée professionnel de Prony, and the Lycée général et technologique Auguste Renoir;
* additionally, the Institut départemental médico-éducatif Gustave Baguer specializes in the education of hearing-impaired children and young people.

===Private schools===
(partly financed by the commune, department, or region) include:
* The École catholique Sainte-Agnès (preschool and elementary school)
* The Institution Saint-Joseph (preschool through junior high school)
* The Institution Sainte-Geneviève (preschool through senior high school)

==Communications==
===Public transport===
Asnières-sur-Seine is served by three stations on Paris Métro Line 13: Gabriel Péri, Les Agnettes, and Les Courtilles, the last named being the terminus of the line.

Line 1 of the Île-de-France tramway also serves the metro station at Les Courtilles, connecting it to Noisy-le-Sec.

Trains on Lines J (Gisors) and L (Cergy) of the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail network call at Asnières-sur-Seine station, while those on Line L (Cergy) also serve Bois-Colombes station which lies just outside the western limit of the commune.

A number of bus routes – lines 140, 165, 175, 177, and 276 – run through Asnières and connect it to its neighbouring communes.

===Roads===
Car traffic in Asnières is difficult. Most of the traffic is on the banks of the Seine around the city. The crossing of the Asnières bridge is extremely crowded and slow during peak hours. The Grand rue Charles-de-Gaulle then the Avenue d&#x27;Argenteuil are also difficult to pass because serving Bois-Colombes and northern towns. Moreover, the city has very few parking spaces, and garages and private parking spaces are scarce and expensive.

Between 2010 and 2013, there was a development plan to change the streets of the city being one-way and become practicable in both directions for bicycles.

==Sport==
In addition to the Courtilles ice rink, the town has ten gyms, six stadiums, a shooting range, two tennis clubs (Azur Tennis Club and the Tennis Club du Ménil), a skate park, a Parisian boules court and a swimming pool.

The Asnières Volley 92 participates in Ligue B (2nd national level) and plays at the Courtilles gymnasium. The city also has a handball club in agreement with neighboring cities. For the 2017–2018 season, the first team evolves in Pool 2 in National 2. Finally, the city counts, with the Molosses, an American football club, created in 1992, evolving in Casque d&#x27;Or (D2), 2-time vice-champion of France of D1 (1999, and 2014).

A full-contact club, known as ABC (Asnieres Boxing Club) is also managed by a coaching team composed with ex-France and European champions. Around 100 members take part in trainings three times a Week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The judo and jujitsu club Arts Martiaux d&#x27;Asnières uses several of the town&#x27;s gyms.

==Asnières in art==
===Georges Seurat===
&quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot; by Georges Seurat depicts a scene of 19th century leisure and developing industry in this suburb of Paris.

Between 1884 and 1886 Seurat painted &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte&quot;, using a new technique – which came to be known as pointillism – of forming an image from patterns of tiny coloured dots.

===Vincent van Gogh===
Vincent van Gogh made a series of paintings of Asnières. Influenced by impressionism and pointillism, he modified his traditional style and used vivid colour, shorter brushstrokes, and perspective to engage the viewer. His views of the banks of the Seine represent an important progression towards his later landscape paintings. In Asnières, within walking distance of his brother Theo&#x27;s flat in Montmartre, van Gogh painted parks, cafés, restaurants, and the river.

==Local landmarks==

*The Château d&#x27;Asnières is a stately home dating from the mid 18th century.
*The Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques in Asnières, dating from 1899, is believed to be Europe&#x27;s oldest public pet cemetery (or &quot;zoological necropolis&quot;).
*The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1899.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Asnières-sur-Seine is twinned with:
* Spandau (Berlin), Germany
* Stockton-on-Tees, England, United Kingdom

==Notable people==
*Manuel Aeschlimann (born 1964), National Assembly deputy and Mayor of Asnières
*Henri Barbusse (1873–1935), politician and writer, a street in the town was named after him
*Maurice Hewitt (1884–1971), violinist
*William Gallas (born 1977), footballer
*Frédéric Gorny (born 1973), actor
*Ginette Keller (born 1925), composer

*Barbara Pravi (born 1993), singer
*Gaston Rivierre (1862–1942), cyclist
*Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890), painter

The old château was the death place of Anne Marie Victoire de Bourbon (1675–1700), daughter of Henri Jules de Bourbon and thus grand daughter of &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;, cousin to Louis XIV.

The Franco-Irish composer and pianist George O&#x27;Kelly died here in 1914.

Louis Vuitton opened his first workshop and resided here until his death. The workshop still stands today and some emblematic pieces are still made there (rigid trunks, leather models).

The Hutu Rwandan businessman and suspected war criminal Félicien Kabuga was arrested here on 16 May 2020 after 26 years as a fugitive for crimes against humanity committed during the Rwandan genocide. Specifically, he is accused of funding the genocide as well as buying thousands of machetes and importing them into Rwanda for use as weapons to kill Tutsis during the genocide.

<text>Rillaton Barrow () is a Bronze Age round barrow in Cornwall, UK. The site is on the eastern flank of Bodmin Moor in the parish of Linkinhorne about four miles (6 km) north of Liskeard.

Rillaton Barrow was excavated in 1837 and found to contain a centrally-placed inhumation beneath the 25m wide barrow. The burial had been placed in a stone cist measuring 2m by almost 1m. Human remains were found along with grave goods including the Rillaton Gold Cup, a bronze dagger, beads, pottery, glass and other items.

==Rillaton Gold Cup==

Most notably, the burial contained the Rillaton Gold Cup, a biconical gold vessel, about 90 mm high, with a handle attached with rivets. The cup resembles a late Neolithic (approx 2300 BC) ceramic beaker with corded decoration and until 2007 was thought to date to a much later period of c. 1650-1400 BC. In 2001 the similar Ringlemere Cup was found which has a similar corded style termed grooved ware, though it was (and remains) crushed nearly flat. Subsequent theories that it might have been deposited as a votive offering have now been abandoned in favour of it being part of the original grave goods in the Ringlemere barrow.

The cup shows an Aegean style and resembles similar finds from the Greek site of Mycenae, suggesting cultural and trading links with the Eastern Mediterranean. The Rillaton Cup and the Pelynt Dagger are two artefacts that have been found in Cornwall that have been claimed to show contact with the Mycenaean world. However a 2006 study by Stuart Needham and others sees no reason to look so far afield for parallels, and locates them in a group with other &quot;unstable&quot; cups (round-bottomed and unable to stand up) in precious materials found in north-western Europe. They propose a date around 1700 BC for the Rillaton Cup, though it may have been buried a long time after it was made. In contrast, the Pelynt Dagger might actually be Mycenaean.

After their discovery in 1837 the finds were sent as Duchy Treasure trove to King William IV, and remained in the royal household. After the death of King George V in 1936 the importance of the cup and associated dagger came to be appreciated, leading to their loan to the British Museum, where the cup remains on show next to the similar Ringlemere Cup, though still belonging to the Royal Collection. The other objects found with the cup have now disappeared, and &quot;no useful descriptions or depictions are known&quot;; they might well have helped assess the date. A replica of the cup is in the Royal Cornwall Museum at Truro.

A legend associated with the cup is that Rillaton is haunted by the spirit of a druid priest, who offers travellers a drink from an undrainable cup. One night a traveller threw the cup&#x27;s contents at the ghost, and was later found dead in a ravine.

<text>The Alexander Palace (, &quot;Alexandrovskiy dvorets&quot;, ) is a former imperial residence near the town of Tsarskoye Selo in Russia, on a plateau about south of Saint Petersburg. The Palace was commissioned by Catherine the Great in 1792.

Due to the privacy it offered when officially resident in St Petersburg, the Alexander Palace was the preferred residence of the last Russian Emperor, Nicholas II and his family; its safety and seclusion compared favourably to the Winter Palace during the years immediately prior to the Russian Revolution. It was the birthplace of Nicholas II&#x27;s eldest child Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, while the rest of his children were born in the Peterhof Palace. In 1917, the palace became the family&#x27;s initial place of imprisonment after the first of two Russian Revolutions in February which overthrew the House of Romanov during World War I. The Alexander Palace is situated in Alexander Park, not far from Catherine Park and the larger, more elaborate Catherine Palace. After undergoing years of renovation, the Alexander Palace opened in Summer 2021 as a state museum housing relics of the former imperial dynasty.

==Construction during the reign of Catherine the Great (Catherine II)==

The Alexander Palace was constructed in the Imperial retreat, near the town of Tsarskoe Selo, 30 miles south of the imperial capital city of St. Petersburg. The palace was commissioned by Empress/Tsarina Catherine II (Catherine the Great) (1729–1796, reigned 1762–1796), built near the earlier Catherine Palace for her favourite grandson, Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, the future emperor (tsar) Alexander I of Russia (1777–1825, reigned 1801–1825), on the occasion of his 1793 marriage to Grand Duchess Elizaveta Alexeievna, born Princess Luise Marie Augusta of Baden.

The Neoclassical edifice was planned by Giacomo Quarenghi and built between 1792 and 1796. It was agreed that the architect had excelled himself in creating a masterpiece. In 1821, a quarter of a century later, the architect&#x27;s son wrote: 

==Home of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Alexeievna==
Alexander used the palace as a summer residence through the remainder of his grandmother&#x27;s and his father, Paul&#x27;s, reign. When he became emperor, however, he chose to reside in the much larger Catherine Palace nearby.

==Under Nicholas I==

Alexander I gave the palace to his brother, the future Nicholas I, for summer usage. From that time on, it was the summer residence of the heir to the throne. From 1830 to 1850, extensive redecoration was carried out according to designs by D.Cerfolio, A.Thon, D.Yefimov, A.Stakenschneider and others in keeping with rapidly changing tastes. The appearance of the formal and private rooms of the palace during Nicholas&#x27; reign can be seen in exquisite watercolours by E. Hau, L. Premazzi and from 1840 to 1860. The famous Mountain Hall which had a large slide built-in for the children of Nicholas I was built during this time. Nicholas I and his family lived in the palace from the early spring till the end of May and after a short period at Krasnoye Selo during manoeuvres returned to the palace to spend their time there until the late autumn. In 1842, the Imperial couple celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with a series of galas including a medieval jousting tournament. Two years later, the family mourned the death of Nicholas&#x27;s daughter Grand Duchess Alexandra (1825–1844), who was born at the palace and lived the last few months of her life there. On 19 October 1860, the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna also died at the palace.

==Under Alexander III and Maria Feodorovna==
Alexander III and his Danish-born wife Maria Feodorovna had their apartments in the right-hand or western wing of the palace near the gardens. Before their accession to the imperial throne, Maria gave birth to their eldest child, the future Nicholas II, at Alexander Palace. In his diary, the then Tsarevich Alexander recorded the momentous event of the birth of his first child,

The entire imperial family was present at the birth of Alexander and Maria&#x27;s first child. In a letter to her mother, Queen Louise, the Tsarevna wrote,

After Alexander III&#x27;s death, Maria Feodorovna would stay at the palace in their rooms while visiting her son (Tsar Nicholas II) and daughter-in-law (Alexandra Feodorovna). As the estrangement with Alexandra Feodorovna became more apparent, the visits of the Dowager Empress became fewer.

==Under Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna==
The palace is most famous though for the role it played in the reign of the last tsar, Nicholas II. He and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna always loved the palace and decided to make it their permanent residence after the events of Bloody Sunday, which made the Winter Palace dangerous for them. They remodeled the former two-story ballroom into the Maple Room and the New Study and added rooms for their children on the floor above. To the horror of the court, Alexandra, and her architect Meltzer, chose a then-modern style of decoration, Jugendstil or Art Nouveau, considered by the aristocracy to be &quot;middle class&quot; and less than &quot;Imperial&quot;. One of these most famous rooms is Alexandra&#x27;s Mauve Room.
During the reign of Nicholas II, the palace was wired for electricity and equipped with a telephone system. In 1899, a hydraulic lift was installed connecting the Empress&#x27; suite with the children&#x27;s rooms on the second floor. Furthermore, with the advent of motion pictures, a screening booth was built in the Semicircular Hall to show films.

During the stormy years of war and revolution, the monumental walls of the Alexander Palace sheltered the Imperial Family from the outside world. Pierre Gilliard, tutor to Nicholas II&#x27;s son, had free access to this inner sanctum. In his memoirs, the tutor later described that the family life at Tsarskoe Selo was less formal than at other residences. Apart from a few exceptions, the court did not reside at the palace. The Imperial Family would gather informally around the table at mealtimes without attendants, unless relatives were visiting.

==Romanovs under house arrest==
Nicholas II abdicated the throne of Russia on 2 March 1917. Thirteen days later, he returned to Alexander Palace not as Emperor of Russia, but as Colonel Romanov. The Imperial Family were now held under house arrest and confined to a few rooms of the palace and watched over by a guard with fixed bayonets. The regime of their captivity, worked out by Alexander Kerensky himself, envisaged strict limitations in the life of the Imperial Family: isolation from the outer world, a guard during their promenades in the park, prohibition of any contacts and correspondence apart from approved letters. Gillard noted,

Due to an increasingly precarious situation in St. Petersburg, the leader of the provisional government, Alexander Kerensky, made the decision to move the Romanov family out of the palace into internal exile in Tobolsk in faraway Siberia. There had been calls for the prisoners to be housed in the prison at the notorious Fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul in St. Petersburg. To avoid this on the morning of 1 August 1917, a train took the family away. They were never to return.

==After the Romanovs==
Not long after the departure of the Romanovs for Siberia, a museum was established within the Alexander Palace. It operated until the beginning of the Second World War. At the beginning of the war, the most valuable furnishings were evacuated to the interior of the country. The remaining parts of the collection were hidden in the basement.

==German occupation during the Second World War==
During the Nazi German occupation, the palace was used as headquarters for the German military command. The area in front of the palace was turned into a cemetery for SS soldiers. Artistically and historically unique collections were partially destroyed. As the German forces were leaving the Soviet Union, many of the former imperial palaces were set ablaze. The Alexander Palace was spared.

==After the war==
After the expulsion of the German forces, the palace was used as a depot for artworks coming back into the area. The neighbouring Catherine Palace had been looted and mostly destroyed. For a time it was planned to restore the interiors of the Alexander Palace, but this decision was reversed. As interest in Nicholas II and his family was discouraged by the Soviet regime, so too was interest in the palace that had been their residence. The new plan was to create a museum to Pushkin. With the exception of the heavily damaged Reception and New Study, the private rooms of the imperial family were altered to plain exhibition halls. The museum plan was then shelved, and the palace was handed over to the Soviet Navy. Many of the palace&#x27;s former collections still existed, but were relocated to other museums such as the Pavlovsk Palace. Alexander Palace was seen as little more than an enhancement to the beautiful Alexander Park.

== Recent history ==
When it appeared that the Soviet Navy intended to vacate the complex, the Alexander Palace was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund (WMF). With funding from American Express in the same year, WMF helped with emergency renovations to the roof over the Nicholas II left wing of the palace, comprising approximately one-third of the building&#x27;s total roof structure. 

In the summer of 1997, a permanent exhibition was opened dedicated to the imperial family. Certain elements of the Reception Room, Nicholas II&#x27;s New Study and Alexandra Feodorovna&#x27;s Drawing Room were recreated to provide a backdrop for exhibitions of historical costumes, weapons and objects of applied art. A portrait of Alexandra Feodorovna by Friedrich von Kaulbach was returned to its original position. Clothing worn by the last imperial family and uniforms related to the court of Tsar Nicholas II were also placed on display. Much of this clothing only survived because it had been used as packing case wadding for more precious objects when the palace was evacuated in World War II.

In 2010 the three largest public rooms in the middle wing were reopened, following partial restoration: the Semi-Circular Hall, the Portrait Hall and the Marble Drawing Room. However, despite the best efforts of curators, limited restoration funds, dispersed collections, and the absence of the palms and flowers – from now-vanished imperial hothouses – that had once lushly decorated several of the rooms, meant that the presentations were somewhat sparse and of varying quality.

In 2014 the Russian government finally allocated significant funds to enable a more complete and authentic restoration of the quarters of the imperial family. This will include the Art Nouveau Maple Room and the celebrated Mauve Room of Alexandra. In September 2015 the palace closed to the public for this major multi-year project.

In August 2021, the east wing of the palace was reopened to visitors following the completion of restorations to the private apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna. The rooms recreated are: the New Study, the Moorish Bathroom, the Working Study, Nicholas&#x27; Reception Room, the Valet&#x27;s Room, the Maple Drawing Room, the Pallisander Drawing Room, the Mauve Boudoir, Alexandra&#x27;s Reception Room, the Imperial Bedroom, the Small and Large Libraries, and the Mountain Hall. The first floor of this wing, once containing the rooms of Nicholas II&#x27;s children, is now home to an exhibition of items belonging to the children of various emperors.

Plans are currently underway for the renovation of the west wing; largely guest apartments at the time of Nicholas II. These are expected to be finished no earlier than 2024.

<text>State Road 434 (SR 434) is a major roadway in the Central Florida area. Starting at SR 424 (Edgewater Drive) just north of Orlando city limits, the road runs north as Forest City Road through Forest City before dropping the name at the Seminole County line. SR 434 continues north and east through Altamonte Springs and Longwood before turning south and east through Winter Springs and Oviedo. SR 434 is called Central Avenue when it first turns south towards downtown Oviedo. After going through downtown Oviedo, SR 434 is called Alafaya Trail from its intersection with Mitchell Hammock Road south to the Orange County line to its end at SR 50 (Colonial Drive). The road continues south as Alafaya Trail only without the state road designation. Alafaya meets with State Road 50 in Union Park, FL.

West of Oviedo SR 434 is signed east–west, south of Oviedo it is signed north–south.

==Route description==
In Seminole County, official maps show SR 434 as being named Sanlando Springs Road through Longwood and Sanford-Oviedo Road through Winter Springs. The road is referred to locally as simply State Road 434, Highway 434, Route 434 or just as 434.

SR 434 is called Alafaya Trail from Mitchell Hammock Road in Oviedo, continuing south into Orange County, to its end at SR 50 (Colonial Drive). Alafaya Trail continues south of Colonial Drive without the SR 434 designation.

In the 1883 plat of Forest City Orange Park, a section of what is now SR 434 south of its intersection with SR 436 was named &quot;Bay Street&quot;.

==History==
SR 434 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as &quot;from a point on SR 436 South for approximately one mile then Northeast to Forest City, thence North and Northeasterly to Longwood, thence South to intersection with SR 436 East of Altamonte Springs; thence Southeasterly to intersection with SR 426 South of Gabriella.&quot;

SR 431 was defined as &quot;from a point on the old Orlando-Apopka Road near the N.E. corner of Section 4, T. 22 S - R. 29 E. Northerly to intersection with SR 436 at Forest City&quot;

The original route of SR 434 had it begin at SR 436 and Bear Lake Road, run south on Bear Lake Road, northeast on Bunnell Road, along the current SR 434 to Longwood, south on CR 427 and Anchor Road, southeast on current SR 436, south on Lake Howell Road, and east on Howell Branch Road to end at SR 426.

At some point, Alafaya Trail from Oviedo south to SR 50 was added as an extension of SR 520. Also around the same time, SR 434 west of Forest City and east of Longwood was removed, and SR 434&#x27;s east end was extended to SR 419.

Eventually, around 1985, SR 434 was extended in both directions, south from the west end along SR 431 and east and south from the east end along SR 419 and SR 520 (which had, in the meantime, become County Road 520 on Alafaya Trail).

In 2013, a short extension of SR 434 opened, connecting the road directly to SR 423 (John Young Parkway) via a flyover bridge across U.S. Route 441 (US 441 or Orange Blossom Trail). A major goal of this extension was to alleviate I-4 traffic.

On June 2, 2018, a section of SR 434 in Oviedo was closed after an old drainage structure below the road collapsed and caused a wide hole to open up. The road reopened to traffic on June 8, 2018 after repairs were made.

<text>Ronald Martland, (February 10, 1907 – November 20, 1997) was a Canadian lawyer and Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He was the second Albertan appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, taking the place of Justice Nolan, who died after only a short time on the Court.

==Family life and education==
Ronald Martland was born in Liverpool, England, in 1907. His family immigrated to Canada in 1911, when he was four years old. He graduated from high school at the age of 14, but was too young to attend university, so he worked as a page in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for two years.

Martland attended the University of Alberta and obtained a B.A. in 1926 and an LL.B in 1928. At law school, he led his class each year, and won the Chief Justice Harvey Gold Medal in his final year. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Hertford College, Oxford University. He received an additional BA in 1930 and a BCL in 1931. He was the first Canadian recipient of the Vinerian Prize. While at Oxford, he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club.

In 1935, he married Iris Euphemia Bury. They had three children.

==Career as a lawyer==
Martland was called to the bar of Alberta in 1932 and practised law at the firm of Milner, Carr, Dafoe &amp; Poirier for over 25 years. He became a leading counsel in the courts of the province, as well as appearing before the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court for the British Commonwealth. He was a bencher of the Law Society of Alberta between 1948 and 1958.

==Supreme Court Justice==
Martland was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada on January 15, 1958, on the nomination of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. He served on the Court as Puisne Justice for 24 years, participating in over 1,700 cases. Of these, he wrote the decision for the majority in some 230 cases and concurring judgments in more than 70 cases. He wrote dissenting judgments in some 40 cases. One of his most significant dissents, co-authored with Justice Ritchie, was in the Patriation Reference, where they argued that as a matter of constitutional law, the federal Parliament did not have the authority to unilaterally request that the British Parliament enact the proposed patriation constitutional amendments. Although in dissent on the legal issue, Martland and Ritchie were in the majority on the second issue in the Reference, the existence of a constitutional convention which required a significant degree of provincial support for major constitutional amendments.

In late 1973, Chief Justice Fauteux announced his retirement from the Court. Justice Martland was the senior puisne justice, and the long-standing tradition was that the most senior judge on the bench would be appointed chief justice. (At that time, the only exceptions to this custom were in 1906 and 1924, when the senior puisne justice had been passed over.) However, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau chose instead to appoint Bora Laskin as Chief Justice. Laskin was the second-most junior judge of the Court, and the appointment created considerable comment. It was said that Justice Martland had been given very little notice that he would be passed over, and was upset by it. The Finance Minister, John Turner, was rumoured to be furious at the departure from the traditions of the Court.

One of the most notable cases that Martland presided over was that of Irene Murdoch, a rancher who had been severely abused by her husband for years. Murdoch wanted a divorce, and, because she had helped to build the ranch over 25 years, argued that she should be given a share of the property. The Supreme Court under Martland refused to give her any part of the property, in a decision that &quot;shocked the consciousness of Canadians&quot; and led to widespread calls for reform.

==Retirement and death==
Martland retired from the Court on February 10, 1982, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. He died on November 20, 1997, at the age of 90.

==Membership in Anglican Church==
Martland was an active member of the Anglican Church of Canada. While in Edmonton, he served as Chancellor (legal advisor) of the Anglican Diocese of Athabasca. While sitting on the Supreme Court, he also served as the Chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa.

==Honours==
Justice Martland received a number of honours:

* 1982 - Companion of the Order of Canada
* 1984 - Alberta Order of Excellence
* Honorary Professor of law at the Universities of Alberta and Calgary
* Honorary fellow of Hertford College, Oxford

==Honorary Degrees==
Justice Martland also received Honorary Degrees from several Universities including

* University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta
* University of King&#x27;s College in Halifax, Nova Scotia

<text>A germicidal lamp (also known as disinfection lamp or sterilizer lamp) is an electric light that produces ultraviolet C (UVC) light. This short-wave ultraviolet light disrupts DNA base pairing, causing formation of pyrimidine dimers, and leads to the inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and protozoans. It can also be used to produce ozone for water disinfection. They are used in ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).

There are four common types available:
* Low-pressure mercury lamps
* High-pressure mercury lamps
* Excimer lamps
* LEDs

==Low-pressure mercury lamps==
Low-pressure mercury lamps are very similar to a fluorescent lamp, with a wavelength of 253.7 nm (1182.5 THz).

The most common form of germicidal lamp looks similar to an ordinary fluorescent lamp but the tube contains no fluorescent phosphor. In addition, rather than being made of ordinary borosilicate glass, the tube is made of fused quartz or vycor 7913 glass. These two changes combine to allow the 253.7 nm ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc to pass out of the lamp unmodified (whereas, in common fluorescent lamps, it causes the phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light). Germicidal lamps still produce a small amount of visible light due to other mercury radiation bands.

An older design looks like an incandescent lamp but with the envelope containing a few droplets of mercury. In this design, the incandescent filament heats the mercury, producing a vapor which eventually allows an arc to be struck, short circuiting the incandescent filament.

As with all gas-discharge lamps, low- and high-pressure mercury lamps exhibit negative resistance and require the use of an external ballast to regulate the current flow. The older lamps that resembled an incandescent lamp were often operated in series with an ordinary 40 W incandescent &quot;appliance&quot; lamp; the incandescent lamp acted as the ballast for the germicidal lamp.

==High-pressure mercury lamps==
High-pressure lamps are much more similar to HID lamps than fluorescent lamps.

These lamps radiate a broad-band UVC radiation, rather than a single line. They are widely used in industrial water treatment, because they are very intense radiation sources. High-pressure lamps produce very bright bluish white light.

==Excimer lamps==
Excimer lamps emit narrow-band UVC and vacuum-ultraviolet radiation at a variety of wavelengths depending on the medium. They are mercury-free and reach full output quicker than a mercury lamp, and generate less heat. Excimer emission at 207 and 222 nm appears to be safer than traditional 254 nm germicidal radiation, due to greatly reduced penetration of these wavelengths in human skin.

== Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) ==

Recent developments in light-emitting diode (LED) technology have led to the commercial availability of UVC LED sources.

UVC LEDs use semiconductor materials to produce light in a solid-state device. The wavelength of emission is tuneable by adjusting the chemistry of the semiconductor material, giving a selectivity to the emission profile of the LED across, and beyond, the germicidal wavelength band. Advances in understanding and synthesis of the AlGaN materials system led to significant increases in the output power, device lifetime, and efficiency of UVC LEDs in the early 2010s.

The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices. Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.

By 2019, LEDs made up 41.4% of UV light sales, up from 19.2% in 2014 The UV-C LED global market is expected to rise from $223m in 2017 to US$991m in 2023.

==Uses==

Germicidal lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. If the quartz envelope transmits shorter wavelengths, such as the 185 nm mercury emission line, they can also be used wherever ozone is desired, for example, in the sanitizing systems of hot tubs and aquariums. They are also used by geologists to provoke fluorescence in mineral samples, aiding in their identification. In this application, the light produced by the lamp is usually filtered to remove as much visible light as possible, leaving just the UV light. Germicidal lamps are also used in waste water treatment in order to kill microorganisms.
The light produced by germicidal lamps is also used to erase EPROMs; the ultraviolet photons are sufficiently energetic to allow the electrons trapped on the transistors&#x27; floating gates to tunnel through the gate insulation, eventually removing the stored charge that represents binary ones and zeroes.

==Ozone production==
For most purposes, ozone production would be a detrimental side effect of lamp operation. To prevent this, most germicidal lamps are treated to absorb the 185 nm mercury emission line (which is the longest wavelength of mercury light which will ionize oxygen).

In some cases (such as water sanitization), ozone production is precisely the point. This requires specialized lamps which do not have the surface treatment.

==Safety concerns==

Short-wave UV light is harmful to humans. In addition to causing sunburn and (over time) skin cancer, this light can produce extremely painful inflammation of the cornea of the eye, which may lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment. For this reason, the light produced by a germicidal lamp must be carefully shielded against direct viewing, with consideration of reflections and dispersed light. A February 2017 risk analysis of UVC lights concluded that ultraviolet light from these lamps can cause skin and eye problems.

<text>Farley Green is a small hamlet of Albury in the Greensand Ridge where it forms the south of the Surrey Hills AONB, to the south east of Guildford.

==History==
On the outskirts of Farley Green, lies Farley Heath where one of Surrey&#x27;s few Roman remains, a temple, can be found. The open heathland was the site of the largest Romano-British settlement in Surrey.

The site was excavated in 1848 by Martin Tupper, an antiquarian and poet, who lived in nearby Albury. Some of his finds are now housed in the British Museum. A Romano-Celtic Temple was in use some time before the end of the 1st century AD and was believed to be destroyed by fire around 450 AD. A number of pottery kilns, dating to the third or fourth centuries were also found. A subsequent excavation took place in 1926 led by S.E. Winbolt. The most recent archaeological excavation was undertaken by Surrey County Archaeological Unit, funded by English Heritage, in 1995. The full report was published in Surrey Archaeological Collections in 2007. The outline of the temple can still be seen and is marked out by stones set in concrete. The pond located on the green was used as a latrine pit by those living in the temple.

==Topography==
The village houses spread mostly along Shophouse Lane which then becomes steep and narrow towards Winterfold Forest which ascends to more than 200 metres Above Ordnance Datum. The forest which climbs right to the summit of the Greensand Ridge is part of the Hurtwood and is where some of the Great Train Robbery proceeds were discovered, buried. The whole undulating area covering the south of Albury parish had been the haunt of smugglers in the distant past.

The hamlet has its own Anglican chapel, dedicated to St Michael, originally a barn built in the 19th century. The barn was given to the parish by Clara Courtenay-Wells, to be converted to a chapel of ease as a memorial to her late husband, who had died in 1929.

<text>Wire fu is an element or style of Hong Kong action cinema used in fight scenes. It is a combination of two terms: &quot;wire work&quot; and &quot;kung fu&quot;.

Wire fu is used to describe a subgenre of kung fu films where the stuntmen&#x27;s or actor&#x27;s skill is augmented with the use of wires and pulleys, as well as other stage techniques, usually to perform fight-scene stunts and give the illusion of super-human ability (or qinggong). It is exemplified by the works of Tsui Hark, Yuen Woo-ping, and Jet Li. Hollywood has subsequently adopted the style for the American film industry. Almost all modern wuxia films fall in this category. Not all martial arts films use wire work.

==In practice==
The basic concept is not very complex and originates in the mechanical effects of stagecraft. Planning and persistence are important, as it often requires many takes to perfect the stunt.

Typically, a harness is hidden under the actor&#x27;s costume, and a cable and pulley system is attached to the harness. When live sets are used, wire removal is done in post-production. Another later-developed technique of creating wire fu is using a green screen and post-production special effects. Green screening the wire work is done for more complex stunts and camera angles. The actors are suspended in the air by green wires, which are then erased digitally during the post-production process. The process by which this was done in older (pre-digital) movies was to use film coloration techniques in a method similar to animation; artists (usually animators), would painstakingly go frame by frame over the raw footage and color in the wires to match the background.

Wire work is often used in kung fu films to simply allow actors to perform stunts beyond their physical abilities. In movies such as &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, it is used to create a more dramatic effect and adds magical realism to the world in which the film takes place. &quot;Wire fu is used to describe a sub genre of kung fu films where the stuntmen&#x27;s or actor&#x27;s skill is augmented with the use of wires and pulleys&quot;

<doc id="1150129" wikidata="Q262415" url="?curid=1150129" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau">
<text>The Diocese of Passau () is a Latin diocese of the Catholic Church in Germany that is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. The Prince-Bishopric of Passau was an ecclesiastical principality that existed for centuries until it was secularized in 1803. The diocese covers an area of 5,442 km².

==History==
===Lorch===
The Diocese of Passau may be considered the successor of the ancient Diocese of Lorch (Laureacum). At Lorch, a Roman station and an important stronghold at the confluence of the rivers Enns and Danube, Christianity found a foothold in the third century, during a period of Roman domination, and a Bishop of Lorch certainly existed in the fourth. The letter of Pope Symmachus (498–514) to Archbishop Theodore of Lorch is a forgery of Bishop Pilgrim. During the great migrations, Christianity on the Danube was completely rooted out, and the Celtic and Roman population was annihilated or enslaved.

===Foundation of the diocese of Passau===
In the region between the rivers Lech and Enns, the wandering Baiuvarii were converted to Christianity in the seventh century, while the Avari, to the east, remained pagan. The ecclesiastical organization of Bavaria was brought about in 739 by the papal legate St. Boniface, who, with the support of Duke Odilo or at least enacting an earlier design of the duke, erected the four sees of Freising, Ratisbon, Passau, and Salzburg. He confirmed as incumbent of Passau, Bishop Vivilo, or Vivolus, who had been ordained in Rome by Pope Gregory III (731-741). From that time, Vivilo resided permanently at Passau, on the site of the old Roman colony of Batavis. Here there existed a church established by a founder now unknown, which was dedicated to St. Stephen. Bishop Vivilo&#x27;s diocese received by annexation the ancient Lorch, which meanwhile had become a small place of little importance. Thanks to the duke, a cathedral was soon erected near the Passau church of St. Stephen, and there the bishop lived in common with his clergy.

The ecclesiastical province of Bavaria was created on 20 April 798, at the request of Charlemagne. Pope Leo III named Salzburg its metropolitan archdiocese, assigning as its suffragan dioceses Passau, Ratisbon, Freising, Säben-Brixen, and Neuburg and sending Bishop Arno of Salzburg the &quot;pallium&quot;. The diocese of Passau was subject to Salzburg until 1728; from 1728 until 1817 it was directly subject to the Holy See (Papacy); from 1826, it became subject to the archdiocese of Munich-Freising.

====Diocesan boundaries====
The boundaries of the Passau diocese extended westwards to the river Isar, and eastwards to the Enns. In ecclesiastical affairs Passau was probably, from the beginning, suffragan to Salzburg. Through the favour of Dukes Odilo and Tassilo, the diocese received many grants and endowments, and several monasteries were established, including Niederaltaich Abbey, Niedernburg Abbey, Mattsee Abbey, Kremsmünster Abbey, these being richly endowed over time. In the late 8th century came the conquest of the Avari, who had assisted the rebellious Duke Tassilo. Subsequently, under Bishop Waltreich (774–804), the district between the Enns and the Raab was added to the diocese, which thus included the whole eastern part (Ostmark) of Southern Bavaria and part of what is now Hungary.

===Troubles with Moravia===
Pope Eugenius II (824–827) was said to have sent a letter to four bishops in Moravia and Hungary (Pannonia), informing them that he had created Bishop Urolfus of Passau an archbishop, and made him metropolitan of an ecclesiastical province, which included the dioceses of Favianensis, Speculiiuliensis (also known as Ouguturensis), Nitravensis, and Vetuarensis. Only two of the diocesan names are known. The document, however, is a forgery. It was invented by Bishop Pilgrim, to advance his claim that the diocese of Passau was the successor of the (arch)diocese of Lorch, and was entitled to the &quot;pallium&quot;. Neither the German kings nor the popes ever acknowledged validity of the claim.

On 24 September 860, at the request of Bishop Hartwig of Passau, King Louis II granted a number of &quot;mansiones&quot; to Hartwig&#x27;s chorepiscopus Alberic. But in May 864, Pope Nicholas I, writing to King Louis, noted that Bishop Hartwig of Passau had been paralysed for the previous four years (&quot;abhinc quattuor annos&quot;), but that he could not simply be deposed or set aside; he could, however, resign the diocese, if he were able to execute the proper documents.

The first missionaries to the pagan Hungarians went out from Passau, and in 866 the Church sent missionaries to Bulgaria.

Before the spring 873, a three year long struggle on the part of several German bishops attempted to unseat Bishop Methodius, the &quot;Apostle to the Slavs.&quot; Pope John VIII (872–882) wrote to his legate in Germany and Pannonia, Bishop Paul of Ancona, ordering him to advise King Louis that Pannonia was directly subject to the Holy See (Papacy), and that he should inform Archbishop Alvinus of Salzburg and Bishop Ermericus of Passau that if they should deprive Bishop Methodius of his sacred ministry, the pope would do the same to them. Ermericus captured Methodius, kept him in prison during the bitter winter, held a meeting of bishops, and would have had Methodius beaten in public, were it not for the intervention of others. Pope John suspended Emericus, and summoned him, along with Bishop Paul and Bishop Methodius, to Rome for trial. He died on 2 January 874.

The Magyars made their first incursions into northern Italy in 899; in 900, they made their first raids into Bavaria. In July 900, Archbishop Dietmar of Salzburg, Bishops Waldo of Frising, Erchanbald of Eichstatt, Zacharias of Säben-Brixen, Tuto of Ratisbon, and Richarius of Passau, sent a letter of complaint to Pope John IX. They wrote that three bishops had come into the diocese of Passau from Moravia, Archbishop John and Bishops Benedict and Daniel, and had consecrated an archbishop and three bishops without the knowledge of the archbishop of Salzburg or the consent of the bishop of Passau. They reminded the pope of the good deeds of the kings of the Franks toward his predecessors; they refuted the charges of the Slavs; and they advised the pope not to believe the lies that they were telling about the Bavarian bishops.

Passau, the outermost eastern bulwark of the Germans, suffered most from the incursions of the Hungarians. At that time many churches and monasteries were destroyed. The canons of Passau suffered especially great losses. On 12 August 903, therefore, at the request of Counts Arbo and Engilmar, vassals of the Church of Passau, and with the consent of Bishop Burchard, King Louis IV agreed to the transfer of &quot;loca&quot; in Innveiertel, along with their &quot;decima&quot; and other appurtenances, which had previously been given as benefices by the bishop, to the power of the canons. This is the earliest clear mention of the canons of Passau as a single body. Additional invasions by Hungarians, usually damaging Passau, occurred in the incursion into Alemannia in 915 and 917, when Basel was destroyed and Alsace devastated; 921, centered on Thuringia and Saxony; 924, in which Franconia suffered; 925 in which Bavaria and Alemannia were attacked; and 926, when incursions reached Gallia.

When, after the victory the Battle of Lechfeld, the Germans pressed forward and regained the old Ostmark, Bishop Adalbert (946-971) hoped to extend his spiritual jurisdiction over Hungary. He was present at the Council of Ingelheim in 948, and his title is given as &quot;bishop&quot;, not &quot;archbishop.&quot;

===Bishop Pilgrim===
His successor, Bishop Piligrim (971-991), who worked successfully for the Christianization of Pannonia, aspired to free Passau from the metropolitan authority of Salzburg, but was completely frustrated in this, as well as in his attempt to assert the metropolitan claims which Passau was supposed to have inherited from Lorch, and to include all Hungary in his diocese. By founding many monasteries in his diocese he prepared the way for the princely power of later bishops. He also built many new churches and restored others from ruins.

===Princes of the Empire===

His successor, Christian (991-1002) received in 999 from Emperor Otto III the market privilege and the rights of coinage, taxation, and higher and lower jurisdiction. Bishop Christian attended the diet of Frankfurt in 1007, at which the decision was taken to establish the diocese of Bamberg, and in 1012 he participated in the consecration of its new cathedral. The Emperor Henry II granted him a large part of the North Forest. Henceforward, indeed, the bishops ruled as princes of the empire, although the title was used for the first time only in a document in 1193. Under Berengar (1013–1045) the whole district east of the Viennese forest as far as Letha and March was placed under the jurisdiction of Passau. During his time the cathedral chapter made its appearance, but there is little information concerning its beginning as a distinct corporation with the right of electing a bishop. This right was much hampered by the exercise of imperial influence.

At the beginning of the Investiture Controversy, Bishop Altmann occupied the see (1065–1091) and was one of the few German bishops who adhered to Pope Gregory VII. He served as papal legate of Pope Gregory. In 1175, he held a council in Passau, in which he had Pope Gregory&#x27;s synodical letters of 1074 and 1075 read to the assembly; they mandated clerical celibacy. There was difficulty in enforcing the mandate, and Altmann wrote to the pope, who replied that if one of the clergy complied, he could be restored to his position, but if one refused, he was to be cut off completely. In 1080, Pope Gregory deposed Bishop Otto of Konstanz in the Roman synod of Lent, and ordered Bishop Altmann to travel to Konstanz and supervise the election of a proper bishop. In 1081, he commissioned Altmann to win back the archbishop of Salzburg and the other bishops who had gone over to King Henry IV, and that he should receive fraternally those who returned to papal obedience, in particular Bishop Benno of Osnabrück. In Easter Week 1085, Altmann attended a synod of bishops at Quindlenburg, presided over by the cardinal bishop of Ostia, in which Wezilo of Mainz; two weeks later, Wezilo and nineteen other schismatic bishops held a meeting at Mainz, and excommunicated fifteen bishops who were loyal to Gregory VII, including Altmann of Passau. Bishop Altmann was driven out of his diocese by his own clergy, who preferred King Henry and his Antipope Clement III. He was replaced by the schismatic Hermann, brother of Duke Liutold of Eppenstein of Carinthia.

Bishop Ulrich (1092–1121) was present at the synod held by Pope Urban II at Piacenza from 1–7 March 1095. He was for a time driven from his see by Emperor Henry IV, promoted monastic reforms and supported the Crusades. Reginmar (1121–1138), Reginbert, Count of Hegenau (1136–1147) who took part in the crusade of Conrad III, and Conrad of Austria (1149–1164), a brother of Bishop Otto of Freising, were all interested in the foundation of new monasteries and the reform for those already existing. Bishop Conrad attended the diet of Ratisbon on 17 September 1156, and witnessed the &quot;privilegium&quot; of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, in which he elevated the Ostmark of Austria into a duchy.

Bishop Diepold of Berg went on the Third Crusade with Frederick Barbarossa in 1189, accompanied by the dean of the cathedral, Tageno, whose diary contributed to later authors. Diepold died in Antioch on 3 November 1190, probably of some plague.

Bishop Ulrich (1215–1221), was formally recognized as a prince of the empire at the Reichstag of Nuremberg in January 1217. The reforms which were begun by bishops Gebhard von Plaien (1221–1232) and Rüdiger von Rodeck (1233–1250) found a zealous promoter in Otto von Lonsdorf (1254–1265), one of the greatest bishops of Passau. He took stringent measures against the relaxed monasteries, introduced the Franciscans and Dominicans into his diocese, promoted the arts and sciences, and collected the old documents which had survived the storms of the preceding period, so that to him we owe almost all our knowledge of the early history of Passau. Bishop Peter, formerly Canon of Breslau, contributed to the House of Habsburg by bestowing episcopal fiefs on the sons of King Rudolph.

Cardinal Guido di Borgogna (Guy de Bourgogne), as papal legate, held a council in Vienna on 10 May 1267, attended, among many others, by Bishop Peter of Passau.

It was during this period that the Fürstenzell Abbey was founded, in 1274.

Bishop Godefrid presided over a diocesan synod, held at St. Pölten on 19 March 1284. Bishop Bernhard of Prambach held a diocesan synod in Passau in June 1293.

===Passau without a bishop===
Under Bernhard of Brambach (1285–1313), Passau started striving to become a free imperial city. After an uprising in May 1298, the bishop granted the burghers, in the municipal ordinance of 1299, privileges in conformity with what was called the Bernhardine Charter. The cathedral having been burned down in 1281, he built a new cathedral which lasted until 1662. Bishop Bernhard died on 27 July 1313.

The cathedral Chapter met as usual to select a successor, but the result was disorder. Two factions selected two different candidates, the larger part chose Canon Gebehard Walse, the minority Canon Albertus, the son of the King of the Romans. Gebehard went to Avignon, to lodge an appeal with Pope Clement V, who died on 20 April 1314 before the matter was resolved; Gebehard too died before a new pope was elected. Pope John XXII rejected Albert, who was under age and not in holy orders. He then, on 3 June 1317, appointed Henri of Vienne, the brother of Jean, the Dauphin of Viennois, who was also under age and not in holy orders. In fact, in April 1313, Pope Clement had granted Henri a license for seven years to study civil law, with the provision that he reside in one of his benefices. Then, on 6 September 1316, Pope John had written to the bishop of Grenoble that Henri wanted to resign all his benefices, and that the bishop should accept his resignations. Documents indicate that there was no bishop seated in Passau in 1317–1320, and that episcopal functions were being carried out by the bishop of Frising. Finally, Pope John XXII appointed Albert of Saxony to the diocese of Passau, on 14 June 1320, though he was only in minor orders, and rector of the parish of Vienna. On 22 June 1320 he was given the privilege of having all his ordinations carried out on the same day, by a bishop of his own choosing. He was ordained a subdeacon in Vienna, and ordained and consecrated in Salzburg by the archbishop in September 1321.

Bishop Albert von Winkel (1363–1380) was particularly active in the struggle with the burghers and in resisting the robber-knights. The Black Death visited the bishopric under Gottfried II von Weitzenbeck (1342–1362).

Bishop George von Hohenlohe (1388–1421) participated in the coronation of King Sigismund of Germany on 8 November 1414 at Aachen; from which he proceeded immediately to the Council of Konstanz, which he attended throughout its sitting, as a close advisor of King Sigismund. He recognized Pope John XXIII, and promoted an expedition against King Ladislaus of Naples. Pope John XXIII granted Bishop George a bull on 1 February 1415, in which he released Passau from all metropolitan subjection to the archbishop of Salzburg, as well as from their control as papal legates, and granted the bishops of Passau the right to use the &quot;pallium&quot;. After 1418, he was imperial chancellor, energetically opposed the Hussites.

At the request of the archbishop of Salzburg, Pope Martin V issued a papal bull on 6 August 1418, &quot;intenta Semper&quot;, in which he cancelled the arrangements made by John XXIII with respect to Passau. Passau&#x27;s archiepiscopal status was removed, and the bishops no longer received the pallium.

===Frederick III, Sixtus IV, and Passau===
During the time of Bishop Ulrich von Nussdorf (1451–1479) the diocese suffered its first great curtailment. At the request of the Emperor Frederick III, the Diocese of Vienna was established by Pope Paul II on 18 January 1469, out of territory taken from the Diocese of Passau. This diocese was afterwards further enlarged at the expense of Passau by Pope Sixtus IV. Towards the close of the fifteenth century the conflict between an Austrian candidate for the see and a Bavarian brought about a state of war in the diocese.

On 1 July 1478, at the request of the Emperor Frederick, Pope Sixtus IV issued the bull &quot;Super Universas&quot;, in which he granted the emperor the right to name the next bishop of Passau on the death of Bishop Ulrich. The emperor conveyed the contents of the bull to the Provost, Dean, and Chapter of Passau, in a letter of 25 October 1478, with the warning that they faced excommunication and loss of imperially granted privileges if they transgressed the terms of the papal bull or the imperial rights.

Bishop Ulrich died on 2 September 1479, and in October, claiming that they had received no notice of the Emperor&#x27;s candidate, they proceeded to their usual and customary election. The name of Canon Frederick Maurkircher was put forward by George, Duke of Bavaria, the son of Duke Louis IX. Maurenkircher was a Doctor of Law and Chancellor of the duchy. In a contentious electoral process, he was supported by Bishop Albertus of Salona, the auxiliary bishop of Passau; and by the Dean of the Chapter, and by six other canons; they were joined by the dean of the collegiate church of Mautern, the abbot of Aspach, the provost of the collegiate church of S. Nicholas, and by two vicars of the cathedral. The emperor&#x27;s nominee was George Hasler, who had studied at the University of Vienna and been a follower of the Franciscan inquisitor, John of Capistrano. Hasler had gone to Rome following his studies, where he became a protonotary apostolic, and then a priest in the papal entourage. He returned to Germany, where he served as the emperor&#x27;s secretary and councillor for more than ten years. In 1477, he was named a cardinal by Sixtus IV, over the objections of the College of Cardinals. The electors at Passau, in a letter to the pope, claimed that the emperor had not nominated his candidate within a reasonable time, but, in a decree of 28 January 1479, Pope Sixtus rejected their claim on grounds of canon law, which provided for as much as a six-month interval between death of an incumbent and nomination of a successor. Furthermore, their claim was beside the point, since they had violated the papal prohibition of an election. Sixtus therefore voided the election of Canon Frederick Maurenkircher, and threatened him with excommunication if he should persist in his claims and pretensions. On the same day, 28 January 1479, the pope provided (appointed) Cardinal George Hasler bishop of Passau.

Bishop Hasler was not welcomed in Passau. On 13 December 1480, Pope Sixtus issued an excommunication against Michael Loehmer, Commissary of the diocese of Passau, because he and his associates refused to turn over the property of the diocese to Cardinal Hasler, and tore down and defiled papal bulls and letters from the doors of the church in Vienna. On 8 January 1481, Pope Sixtus admonished Dukes Albert and George of Bavaria not to give aid and comfort to the enemies of Cardinal George Hasler who had already been excommuinicated by the pope. On 15 January 1481, Pope Sixtus provided faculties and orders to his nuncio in Germany, Bishop Orso Orsini of Theano, to cite the auxiliary bishop Albertus, Canon Frederick, and the other canons of Passau, to appear at the papal court and purge themselves of suspicion of heresy.

Cardinal Hasler died on 21 September 1482; his body was taken to Vienna, where he was buried in the church of S. Maria Stiegen. On 30 October 1482, Pope Sixtus IV appointed Bishop-elect Friedrich Maurenkircher to the bishopric of Passau.

===Reformation===
The Protestant Reformation was kept out of all the Bavarian part of the diocese, except the Countship of Ortenburg, by the efforts of Ernest of Bavaria who, though never consecrated, ruled the diocese from 1517 to 1541. Lutheranism found many adherents, however, in the Austrian portion. Bishops Wolfgang von Salm (1540–1555) and Urban von Trennbach (1561–1598) led the counter-Reformation. Under Bishop Wolfgang the Peace of Passau was concluded, in the summer of 1552. The last Bavarian prince-bishop was Urban, who in his struggles during the Reformation received substantial aid for the Austrian part of the diocese from Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, and, after 1576, from Emperor Rudolf II. All the successors of Urban were Austrians. Bishop-elect Leopold Ferdinand of Austria (1598–1625) (who also held the diocese of Strasburg after 1607) was one of the first to enter the Catholic League of 1609. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War he was loyal to his brother, Emperor Ferdinand II. Leopold II Wilhelm (1625–1662), son of Ferdinand II, a pious prince and a great benefactor of the City of Passau, especially after the great conflagration of 1662, finally united five bishoprics.

Bishop Wenzelaus von Thun (1664–1673) began the new cathedral which was completed thirty years later by his successor Cardinal John Philip von Lamberg. Bishop John Philip was named a cardinal by Pope Innocent XII on 21 June 1700. His nephew and successor, Bishop Joseph Dominicus von Lamberg (1723–1762), was appointed a cardinal by Pope Clement XII on 20 December 1737. They were brother and son to Franz Joseph I, Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, and both cardinals served as diplomats for the Austrian court.

===Archdiocese===

In November 1719, the Emperor Charles VI wrote to Pope Clement XI, requesting that he elevate the bishopric of Vienna to the rank of metropolitan see. The pope referred the proposal to the Consistorial Congregation, which reported favorably on 6 March 1721. Before the bulls could be prepared for signature, however, the pope died, on 19 March. The new pope, Innocent XIII, issued the bulls on 1 June 1722, and named Sigismund von Kollonitz to the archbishopric. When Vienna was raised to an archdiocese in 1722, Bishop Raymond von Rabatta relinquished the parishes beyond the Viennese Forest, but in compensation the diocese of Passau was exempted from the metropolitan authority of Salzburg, and became a metropolitan diocese itself, directly dependent upon the Holy See (Papacy); the bishop obtained the pallium for himself and his successors. Archbishop Leopold Ernst von Firmian (1763–1783), created cardinal by Pope Clement XIV on 14 December 1772, established an institute of theology at Passau, and, after the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, founded a lyceum.

Under Archbishop Joseph von Auersperg (1783–1795), the Emperor Joseph II took away two-thirds of the diocese to form the dioceses of Linz and St. Pölten and to enlarge for the last time the archdiocese of Vienna. Pope Pius VI issued the bull &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot; on 28 January 1784, establishing the diocese of Linz. On the same day, the pope issued another bull, &quot;Inter plurimas,&quot; in which he established the diocese of St. Pölten, also partially on territory which had been part of the diocese of Passau.

The last prince-bishop, Leopold von Thun (1796–1826), saw the secularization of the old bishopric in 1803; the City of Passau and the temporalities on the left bank of the Inn and the right bank of the Ilz went to Bavaria, while the territory on the left banks of the Danube and of the Ilz went to Ferdinand III of Habsburg-Lorraine, the former Grand Duke of Tuscany, becoming part of the Electorate of Salzburg and afterwards to Austria. On 22 February 1803, when the Bavarians marched into Passau, the prince-bishop withdrew to his estates in Bohemia, and never revisited his former residence.

===Reconstruction===
After the abdication of Napoleon (1815), Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria was confirmed as king of Bavaria by the Congress of Vienna, and as a member of the Federative Constitution of Germany, on 8 June 1815. There were adjustments in boundaries, the most significant being the transfer of Salzburg from Bavaria to Austria. New boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses, therefore, had to be negotiated. A concordat between Bavaria and the Papacy was negotiated by Cardinal Ercole Consalvi and Baron Johann Casimir Häffelin, and signed on 5 June 1817. The diocese of Freising was suppressed and its territory incorporated into the diocese of Munich. Article IX granted the kings of Bavaria in perpetuity the right to nominate candidates to all the vacant archbishoprics and bishoprics in the kingdom, subject to papal approval.

On 1 April 1818, Pope Pius VII issued the bull &quot;Dei ac Domini&quot;, in which he put into effect canonically the changes agreed to in the Concordat with Bavaria. He began by abolishing the ecclesiastical province of Ratisbon, with all the dioceses within it, including Passau, and the Provostship of Berchtesgaden. When the diocese was reconstituted, it contained, in addition to the city of Passau, 136 parishes, which are listed in the papal bull. The Chapter of the cathedral of S. Stephen in Passau was to consist of two dignities, the Provost and the Dean, and eight canons, four major and four minor. This was a reduction from the 23 canonries which had existed in the 18th century.

Passau was made directly subject to the Holy See until the death of the last prince-archbishop, Leopold von Thun, which took place on 22 October 1826. Thereafter, the diocese became a suffragan of Munich-Freising.

Pope Benedict XVI was born and baptized on Holy Saturday, 16 April 1927, at Marktl am Inn, which is located within the Diocese of Passau.

<text>Sandgate is a village in the Folkestone and Hythe Urban Area in the Folkestone and Hythe district of Kent, England. It had a population of 4,225 at the 2001 census. It is the site of Sandgate Castle, a Device Fort. H. G. Wells lived at Spade House, and it is also the birthplace of comedian Hattie Jacques. Sandgate is the location of the Shorncliffe Redoubt, a Napoleonic-era earthwork fort associated with Sir John Moore and the 95th Regiment of Foot, known as the 95th Rifles. St Paul&#x27;s Church lies next to the Saga building, which is built on the site of Embrook House.

Sandgate was an urban district from 1894 to 1934 (having previously been part of Cheriton parish). It was added to Folkestone in 1934. In 2004, the village re-acquired civil parish status. The parish shares the boundaries of Folkestone Sandgate ward, at .

The Sandgate branch railway line was opened in 1874 and closed to passengers in 1951. Little of the infrastructure now remains, but it is still possible to see the remains of a tall overbridge at the bottom of Hospital Hill.

The Morcheeba song &quot;The Sea&quot; is written about the beachside bar &#x27;Bar Vasa&#x27;. Sandgate Hotel appeared on the Channel 4 programme &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot; on 27 February 2006. Other pubs include The Ship Inn, The Providence Inne, The Clarendon Inn and The Royal Norfolk Hotel. The Brisbane suburb with the same name is named after the town. There is also a Brisbane suburb called Shorncliffe, which is adjacent to Sandgate.

<text>Rabieh () is a suburban area on the northern edge of Greater Beirut, Lebanon, about 13 kilometers driving distance from Beirut. It is located in the foothills of Mount Lebanon, on the road to Bikfaya. Rabieh saw its population increase sharply in the late 1980s, following the Lebanese civil war. Rabieh is famous for its biodiversity and ecological richness.

Rabieh has a geo-strategic location, it is only 15 to 20 minutes away from the vibrant capital Beirut, and is a minute&#x27;s drive from the Bikfaya highway.

Despite its proximity to the capital, Rabieh&#x27;s population density is relatively low. It is situated at 200–300 m above sea level.

<text>David Shelby Walker (May 2, 1815 – July 20, 1891) was the eighth Governor of Florida, serving from 1865 to 1868. He served in the Florida House of Representatives and as Mayor of Tallahassee. He also served as a judge. He was a Whig before shifting parties.

==Early life and career==
Walker was born near Russellville in Logan County, Kentucky. He attended private schools in Kentucky and Tennessee and studied law. He moved to Florida in 1837, settling in Leon County. His father was David Walker, a prominent early Kentucky politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives. David S. Walker was a cousin and close business and political confidante of Florida territorial governor Richard K. Call. He was also related to Florida Senator Wilkinson Call, who was Walker&#x27;s law partner for several years in the 1850s and 1860s in Tallahassee.

Walker entered politics as a Whig and was elected to the first session of the Florida State Legislature in 1845, serving Wakulla and Leon Counties as a senator. In 1848, he was elected by Leon County to the Florida House of Representatives. In 1849, he was appointed Register of Public Lands and was &quot;ex officio&quot; State Superintendent of Public Instruction, positions he held until 1854. He advocated and promoted interest in public schools. His efforts resulted in creating public schools in Tallahassee. He served as Mayor of Tallahassee. He was the Know Nothing gubernatorial candidate in 1856 but lost to Democrat Madison S. Perry by 2.6 points. In 1859, he became a Florida Supreme Court Justice. Walker is also known for establishing Tallahassee&#x27;s first library in the mid-1800s through his private funds in a time where money was not allocated to libraries outside of urban areas, especially in a &quot;rural&quot; state.

==Governorship==
Before the American Civil War, Walker was a Constitutional Unionist and so had opposed secession. However, when Florida declared secession from the United States in 1861, he supported his state. Following the war, on November 29, 1865, Walker was elected governor unopposed in an election in which newly freed slaves were not allowed to participate. He was inaugurated on December 20 and took office January 18, 1866.

During his governorship, Florida transitioned from the federal oversight and military occupation of Reconstruction to readmission into the Union. Walker was a conservative who attempted to minimize changes to the antebellum social, political, and economic system. He protested the election of the 1868 Constitutional Convention, which was convened to adopt a new government that the Republican U.S. Congress would approve. He ultimately supported the 1868 Constitution when it turned out to be less protective of blacks than initially anticipated.

He did not run for reelection in the 1868 election, the first in which African American men could vote.

He returned to practicing law after leaving the governor&#x27;s office on July 4, 1868. In 1878, he was appointed circuit court judge, a position he held until his death on July 20, 1891.

==Legacy==
Tallahassee&#x27;s first public library is the David S. Walker Library.

<doc id="1150145" wikidata="Q837299" url="?curid=1150145" title="Vendémiaire">
<text>Vendémiaire () was the first month in the French Republican calendar. The month was named after the Occitan word &quot;vendemiaire&quot; &#x27;grape harvester&#x27;.

Vendémiaire was the first month of the autumn quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;automne&quot;). It started on the day of the autumnal equinox, which fell between 22 September and 24 September, inclusive. It thus ended between 21 October and 23 October, and was the season of the vintage in the wine districts of northern France. It follows the Sansculottides of the past year and precedes Brumaire.


== Day name table ==

Like all FRC months Vendémiaire lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks, called &quot;décades&quot; (decades). In accordance with the suggestion of Fabre d&#x27;Églantine, each of the days of the republican year was consecrated to some useful object. Thus every day in Vendémiaire had the name of an agricultural or ornamental plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal (Quintidi) or an agricultural tool (Decadi).

<doc id="1150156" wikidata="Q2412633" url="?curid=1150156" title="The Lurking Horror">
<text>The Lurking Horror is an interactive fiction game released by Infocom in 1987. The game was written by Dave Lebling and inspired by the horror fiction writings of H. P. Lovecraft (including his Cthulhu Mythos). The original release was for MS-DOS, Apple II, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit computers, and Commodore 64. It was Infocom&#x27;s 26th game and the only in the horror genre. Infocom rated it as &quot;Standard&quot; in terms of difficulty. Later, it was ported to the Amiga with the addition of sound effects, making it the first Infocom adventure with that feature.

==Plot==
The game starts with the player trying to finish a term paper at G.U.E. Tech, a large MIT-like American university. The player has braved a snowstorm to travel to the school&#x27;s computer lab to work on the report. The document is now mangled beyond repair, however; with the help of a hacker, the player finds that the file has been partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy&#x27;s files. Although the game begins as a quest to try to salvage the term paper, alarming events soon unfold, revealing a powerful evil within the school&#x27;s depths.

What began as a mere snowstorm has strengthened into a full-force blizzard. The player must traverse the University grounds in an attempt to recover the term paper&#x27;s data. Much of the campus is deserted and covered in snowdrifts, rendering walkways impassable. The only accessible avenues are steam tunnels and a small complex of buildings. In the course of unraveling the mystery, the player encounters demons, zombies, and sinister references to a recent campus suicide. Failing to set things right in the hidden passages beneath the school will result in a literal fate worse than death.

==Development and release==
The name of the university, G.U.E. Tech, is an obvious nod to Infocom&#x27;s Zork games, which are set in the Great Underground Empire. In &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot;, G.U.E. Tech is an abbreviation for &quot;George Underwood Edwards Institute of Technology&quot;. Many features of G.U.E. Tech, including the steam tunnels, are modeled after MIT, which many of Infocom&#x27;s developers attended. In particular, the Infinite Corridor is a central feature of the MIT campus, and a door marked &quot;Department of Alchemy&quot; actually exists in Building 2 thanks to a late-20th-century hack.

All of Infocom&#x27;s game packages since &quot;Deadline&quot; included extra content in their game packages called &quot;feelies&quot;. The feelies for &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot; included: a student ID card; &quot;G.U.E. at a Glance&quot;, a guide for freshmen of the school, including maps of the campus and buildings and background information on the school; a rubber centipede-like creature reminiscent of one of the monsters in the game (this was not mentioned on the package, and made for a creepy moment even before the user played the game). In addition to maps and other information necessary to complete the game, the &quot;G.U.E. at a Glance&quot; booklet contains many jabs at technology-oriented schools like MIT and Caltech. These straight-faced jokes include &quot;In spite of what your roommate will tell you, G.U.E. Tech does not have the highest suicide rate in the country&quot; and &quot;Women: There&#x27;s no need to go anywhere. With a male/female ratio of 6:1, someone WILL say hello to you.&quot; G.U.E. Tech&#x27;s motto, seen on the student ID card in the feelies, is &quot;Omne ignotum pro magnifico&quot;, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;Everything unknown is taken for magnificent.&quot;, taken from Tacitus (Agricola), Book 1, 30.

==Reception==

The game was very well received. Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote of &quot;Lurking&quot;, &quot;Stephen King couldn&#x27;t have done it better&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 24th top game of all time, calling it &quot;the best adventure game of all time,&quot; as well as &quot;one of only two in the horror genre that has ever seemed genuinely scary (&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is the other).&quot; They elaborated that &quot;Not only are the puzzles spot on genius, the writing is fantastic - a brilliant combination of the realism of Stephen King ... and the nameless, strangling horrors of H.P. Lovecraft.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot; as number 35 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Literate gamers not afraid of their keyboards will find an amazing world inside this text-only adventure game.&quot; In 2004, &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot; ranked number 10 on GameSpy&#x27;s list of the scariest games of all time.

<text>Steve Jolley (born October 15, 1975) is a retired American soccer defender, who spent ten seasons in Major League Soccer and one in the Premier Development League. Today, Jolley provides color commentary for the New York Red Bull&#x27;s games on Red Bulls Radio. Additionally, he works for a wealth management firm, Walsh &amp; Nicholson Financial Group.

==Career==
Jolley led Kempsville High School to back-to-back Virginia state championships. After playing college soccer at College of William and Mary, Jolley was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy with the ninth overall pick of the 1997 MLS College Draft. He spent the next three years in Los Angeles, switching from the midfield into defense as time went on. The lowlight of his Galaxy career came in the 1999 MLS Cup, when Jolley had to come into the game just nine minutes from the start for the injured Robin Fraser. Jolley scored four goals during his time with the Galaxy.

He was traded to the MetroStars for a second-round draft pick after playing just four minutes for the Galaxy in 2000. He combined with Mike Petke and Daniel Hernández on an excellent three-man backline that helped the Metros rise in the MLS standings. Jolley would play every possible Metro minute of the 2000 and 2001 seasons. He finished his Metro career in 2003 with 104 league games and 129 in all competitions (both numbers third in team history), seven goals (eight in all competitions) and six assists. He also became prominent in the community and earned MLS Humanitarian of the Year honors in 2002 in part for his effort for 9/11 related charities.

Jolley was traded to the then-Dallas Burn before the 2004 season for Tenywa Bonseu. He became a regular for Dallas, scoring one goal and starting almost every game, but also had a dubious distinction of scoring two own goals in one game (for Jolley, only one of those was attributed to him). After losing his starting job with the club in 2005, he was traded back to the MetroStars before the 2006 season. At the end of the year, he was waived by the team, which had become known as New York Red Bulls.

After a brief retirement from soccer, he returned in 2007 to play for the Long Island Rough Riders in the Premier Development League.

Jolley now works as an analyst on Red Bulls radio broadcasts.

<doc id="1150161" wikidata="Q1060893" url="?curid=1150161" title="Medicine wheel">
<text>Historically, most medicine wheels follow a similar pattern of a central circle or cluster of stones, surrounded by an outer ring of stones, along with &quot;spokes&quot; (lines of rocks) radiating from the center out to the surrounding ring. Often, but not always, the spokes may be aligned to the cardinal directions (East, South, West, and North). In other cases, some stones may be aligned with astronomical phenomena. These stone structures may be called &quot;medicine wheels&quot; by the Indigenous nation which built them, or by more specific names in that nation&#x27;s language.

Physical medicine wheels made of stone have been constructed by a number of different Indigenous cultures in North America, notably many of the Plains nations. The structures are associated with Native American and Indigenous Canadian religious ceremonies.

== Nomenclature ==

The Royal Alberta Museum (2005) holds that the term &quot;medicine wheel&quot; was first applied to the Big Horn Medicine Wheel in Wyoming, the southernmost archeological wheel still extant. The term &quot;medicine&quot; was not applied not necessarily because of any healing that was associated with that medicine wheel, but denotes that the sacred site and rock formations were of central importance and attributed with religious, hallowed, and spiritual significance.

== Stone structures as sacred architecture ==
Intentionally erecting massive stone structures as sacred architecture is a well-documented activity of ancient monolithic and megalithic peoples. 

The Royal Alberta Museum posits the possible point of origin, or parallel tradition, to other round structures such as the tipi lodge, stones used as &quot;foundation stones&quot; or &quot;tent-pegs&quot;:
Scattered across the plains of Alberta are tens of thousands of stone structures. Most of these are simple circles of cobble stones which once held down the edges of the famous tipi of the Plains Indians; these are known as &quot;tipi rings.&quot; Others, however, were of a more esoteric nature. Extremely large stone circlessome greater than 12 meters acrossmay be the remains of special ceremonial dance structures. A few cobble arrangements form the outlines of human figures, most of them obviously male. Perhaps the most intriguing cobble constructions, however, are the ones known as medicine wheels.

== Locality, siting and proxemics ==

Stone medicine wheels are sited throughout the northern United States and southern Canada, specifically South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Alberta and Saskatchewan. The majority of the approximately 70 documented stone structures still extant are in Alberta, Canada.

One of the prototypical medicine wheels is in the Bighorn National Forest in Big Horn County, Wyoming. This wheel has 28 spokes, and is part of a vast set of old Native American sites that document 7,000 years of their history in that area.

Medicine wheels are also found in Ojibwa territory, the common theory is that they were built by the prehistoric ancestors of the Assiniboine people.

Larger astronomical and ceremonial petroforms, and Hopewell mound building sites are also found in North America.

== Structure, fabrication and patterning ==

In defining the commonalities among different stone medicine wheels, the Royal Alberta Museum cites the definition given by John Brumley, an archaeologist from Medicine Hat, that a medicine wheel &quot;consists of at least two of the following three traits: (1) a central stone cairn, (2) one or more concentric stone circles, and/or (3) two or more stone lines radiating outward from a central point.&quot;

From the air, a medicine wheel often looks like a wagon wheel lying on its side. The wheels can be large, reaching diameters of 75 feet.

The most common variation between different wheels are the spokes. There is no set number of spokes for a medicine wheel to have although there are usually 28, the same number of days in a lunar cycle. The spokes within each wheel are rarely evenly spaced, or even all the same length. Some medicine wheels will have one particular spoke that is significantly longer than the rest. The spokes may start from the center cairn and go out only to the outer ring, others go past the outer ring, and some spokes start at the outer ring and go out from there.

Sometimes there is a passageway, or a doorway, in the circles. The outer ring of stones will be broken, and there will be a stone path leading in to the center of the wheel. Some have additional circles around the outside of the wheel, sometimes attached to spokes or the outer ring, and sometimes floating free of the main structure.

While alignment with the cardinal directions is common, some medicine wheels are also aligned with astronomical phenomena involving the Sun, Moon, some stars, and some planets in relation to the Earth&#x27;s horizon at that location. The wheels are generally considered to be sacred sites, connected in various ways to the builders&#x27; particular culture, lore and ceremonial ways.

Other North American Indigenous peoples have made somewhat-similar petroforms, turtle-shaped stone piles with the legs, head, and tail pointing out the directions and aligned with astronomical events.

== Cultural value, attribution and meaning ==
Stone medicine wheels have been built and used for ceremonies for millennia, and each one has enough unique characteristics and qualities that archaeologists have encountered significant challenges in determining with precision what each one was for.

One of the older wheels, the Majorville medicine wheel located south of Bassano, Alberta, has been dated at 3200 BCE (5200 years ago) by careful stratification of known artifact types. Like Stonehenge, it had been built up by successive generations who would add new features to the circle. Due to that and its long period of use (with a gap in its use between 3000 and 2000 years ago, archaeologists believe that the function of the medicine wheel changed over time.

Astronomer John Eddy put forth the suggestions that some of the wheels had astronomical significance, where spokes on a wheel could be pointing to certain stars, as well as sunrise or sunset, at a certain time of the year, suggesting that the wheels were a way to mark certain days of the year. In a paper for the &quot; Journal for the History of Astronomy&quot; Professor Bradley Schaefer stated that the claimed alignments for three wheels studied, the Bighorn medicine wheel, one at Moose Mountain in southeastern Saskatchewan, and one at Fort Smith, Montana, there was no statistical evidence for stellar alignments.

== Medicine Wheel Park ==
Joe Stickler of Valley City State University, North Dakota, with the assistance of his students, began the construction of Medicine Wheel Park in 1992. The Park showcases two solar calendars: &quot;a horizon calendar (the medicine wheel) and a meridian or noontime calendar.&quot; According to the Medicine Wheel website, the &quot;large circle measures 213 feet (approximately 65 meters) around. The 28 spokes radiating from its center represent the number of days in the lunar cycle. Six spokes extending well beyond the Wheel are aligned to the horizon positions of sunrises and sunsets on the first days of the four seasons.&quot;

==Medicine wheel symbol==
The medicine wheel has been adapted into a visual symbol, with associated correspondences and meanings, by pretendian Hyemeyohsts Storm, who first published his invention in 1972. It has been adopted as a visual icon and teaching tool by a number of pan-Indian groups, as well as Native groups whose ancestors did not traditionally use medicine wheels as a structure. It has also been misappropriated by non-Indigenous people, usually those associated with New Age communities, who have often added additional elements from non-Native cultures.

<doc id="1150162" wikidata="Q471946" url="?curid=1150162" title="New Place">
<text>New Place was William Shakespeare&#x27;s final place of residence in Stratford-upon-Avon. He died there in 1616. The whole building was demolished in 1702 by Sir John Clopton, who replaced it with a modern-style house, also called New Place. This in turn was demolished by Francis Gastrell, vicar of Frodsham, Cheshire, in 1759. It was never rebuilt after the second demolition and only the foundations remain.

Though the house no longer exists, the site is owned by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which maintains it as a specially-designed garden for tourists.

==Early history==
The three storied house stood on the corner of Chapel Street and Chapel Lane, and was apparently the second largest dwelling in the town. The current site of New Place was initially within the plot of an Iron Age farmstead sometime around 700 BC – 43 AD, as indicated by pottery that also dates to the same time period. New Place was built atop the site of a former 13th-century timber building in 1483 by Sir Hugh Clopton, a wealthy London mercer and Lord Mayor. Built of timber and brick (then an innovation in Stratford) it had ten fireplaces, five handsome gables, and grounds large enough to incorporate two barns and an orchard.

In 1496 Sir Hugh Clopton left New Place in his will to his great-nephew William Clopton I (&#x27;my cousin William Clopton&#x27;) and the male heirs of the lordship of Clopton. In his will William Clopton I (d. 29 May 1521) granted his wife, Rose (d. 17 August 1525) a life interest in the property, with the reversion after her death to his son, William Clopton II. When John Leyland visited in 1540, he described New Place as a &quot;&quot;praty house of Bricke and tymbre wherm he (ie Hugh Clopton) lived in his latter dayes and dyed&quot;.&quot; In November 1543, William Clopton II leased it for forty years to a surgeon, Thomas Bentley (d.1549), who left his wife, Anne, a life interest in the lease during her widowhood. Anne remarried, however, and after she became the wife of Richard Charnock, William Clopton II retook possession of New Place. By his wife Elizabeth Grey, the daughter of Sir Edward Grey of Enville, Staffordshire, William Clopton II had a son, William Clopton III (1537–1592), to whom he left New Place by will in 1560. On 20 December 1563, hard-pressed for money to pay his sisters&#x27; marriage portions and continue travelling in Italy, William Clopton III sold New Place to William Bott, who had already resided in it for several years. In 1567 Bott sold New Place to William Underhill I (c. 1523 – 31 March 1570), an Inner Temple lawyer and clerk of assizes at Warwick, and a substantial property holder in Warwickshire&quot;.&quot;

==Sale to Shakespeare==

At his death in 1570, Underhill left New Place to his son, William Underhill II (d.1597), who in 1597 sold it to William Shakespeare for £60. He (William Underhill II) died two months later, and it emerged that he had been poisoned by his eldest son and heir, Fulke Underhill. According to some sources, Fulke Underhill died in May 1598 while still a minor and before the fact that he had murdered his father was discovered. According to other sources, however, Fulke Underhill was hanged in 1599 for his father&#x27;s murder and attainted for felony, whereby his property, including New Place, was forfeit to the crown. In 1602 the Court of Exchequer appointed a commission to &quot;obtain an account of the possessions of Fulke Underhill of Fillongley, county Warwick, felon, who had taken the life of his father, William Underhill, by poison&quot;. When Fulke&#x27;s younger brother, Hercules Underhill, came of age in 1602, his father&#x27;s former properties were regranted to him, and he and Shakespeare negotiated a confirmation of the sale.

==After Shakespeare&#x27;s death==
In 1616 the house passed to his daughter Susanna Hall, and then his granddaughter, Elizabeth Hall, who had recently remarried after the death of her first husband, Thomas Nash, who had owned the house next door. After Elizabeth died, the house was returned to the Clopton family.

In 1702 Sir John Clopton demolished the original New Place, building in its place a replacement, also called New Place, in a very different contemporary style. In 1756 then-owner Reverend Francis Gastrell (vicar of Frodsham, Cheshire) having become tired of visitors, attacked and destroyed a mulberry tree in the garden said to have been planted by Shakespeare. In retaliation, the townsfolk destroyed New Place&#x27;s windows. Gastrell applied for local permission to extend the garden. His application was rejected and his tax was increased, so Gastrell retaliated by demolishing the house in 1759. This greatly outraged the inhabitants and Gastrell was eventually forced to leave town.

The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust acquired New Place and Nash&#x27;s House in 1876. Today the site of New Place is accessible through a museum that resides in Nash&#x27;s House, the house next door. The site received 109,452 visitors during 2018.

==Archaeological excavations==
Excavations in the grounds of Nash&#x27;s House were initially carried out in 1862 and January 1864 by James Halliwell-Phillipps but after the excavations were finished, the ruins were eventually covered up by a garden and further excavations carried out during 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Birmingham Archaeology, removing the garden from the site all together. Archaeologists from &quot;Time Team&quot; visited the dig during 2011 and a special programme on the subject, &quot;Searching for Shakespeare&#x27;s House&quot;, was transmitted on 11 March 2012. BBC One National Treasures broadcast a live programme from the site in August 2011. Findings from the excavation indicated the presence of a Tudor structure but were inconclusive as to the ground plan of Shakespeare&#x27;s original house.

===Clay pipe fragments at Stratford-upon-Avon===
Clay pipe fragments unearthed in recent years in Shakespeare&#x27;s Stratford-upon-Avon garden were found to possibly contain traces of cannabis, along with tobacco and camphor, based on the results of a study published in the &quot;South African Journal of Science&quot;. This has fuelled speculation by some that Shakespeare may have possibly smoked cannabis, which is known to have been used to treat certain medical conditions at the time by Elizabethans, as well as in the manufacture of materials such as sails, rope, and clothing, and may have also been used for purposes of pleasure. The pipe fragments, however, could have belonged to any number of other persons besides the famous playwright, and cannot be definitively dated to the periods of his residency there as they could have been from the 18th century, around 200 years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death.

<text>Dorothy Margaret Doig Edgington FBA (née Milne, born 29 April 1941) is a British philosopher active in metaphysics and philosophical logic. She is particularly known for her work on the logic of conditionals and vagueness.

==Life and education==
Dorothy Edgington was born on 29 April 1941 to Edward Milne and his wife Rhoda née Blair. She attended St Leonards School before going to St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford to read PPE. She obtained her BA in 1964, followed in 1967 by a BPhil at Nuffield College, Oxford.

==Career==
Most of Edgington&#x27;s career was spent at Birkbeck College. Her first academic post in 1968, was as Lecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck and she remained there until 1996. From 1996 until 2001 she was appointed Fellow of University College, Oxford. This was followed by a professorship at Birkbeck from 2001 to 2003. She was then Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at the University of Oxford from 2003 until 2006. She is now Emeritus Professor, and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford and teaches at Birkbeck again part-time. 

Birkbeck College hosts a lecture series named after Edgington; in 2012, the lectures were given by John McDowell, in 2014 they were given by Rae Langton, and in 2016 the Edgington Lectures were given by Kit Fine.

From 2004 to 2005 she was President of the Mind Association 2004–5 and she was President of the Aristotelian Society for 2007–8. She is a Fellow of the British Academy.

In 2023 she was elected a member of the Academia Europaea.

<text>Choreoathetosis is the occurrence of involuntary movements in a combination of chorea (irregular migrating contractions) and athetosis (twisting and writhing).

It is caused by many different diseases and agents. It is a symptom of several diseases, including GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, phenylketonuria, and Huntington disease and can be a feature of kernicterus (rapidly increasing unconjugated bilirubin that cross the blood-brain-barrier in infants).

Choreoathetosis is also a common presentation of dyskinesia as a side effect of levodopa-carbidopa in the treatment of Parkinson disease.

The use of crack cocaine or amphetamines can result in conditions nicknamed &quot;crack dancing&quot;, or &quot;tweaking&quot; respectively, described as choreoathetoid.

<doc id="1150168" wikidata="Q692667" url="?curid=1150168" title="Globi">
<text>Globi is a Swiss cartoon character occasionally referred to as Switzerland&#x27;s Mickey Mouse. He is pictured as an anthropomorphic blue parrot with a yellow beak wearing a black beret and a pair of red and black checkered trousers. He was created by the Swiss cartoonist Robert Lips, as an advertising character for the Swiss department store Globus in 1932 for the company&#x27;s 25th anniversary. His name was originally planned as &quot;Kimbukku&quot;, but he was later renamed Globi after the local Basel German &quot;(Baseldytsch)&quot; dialect word for the department store that created him.

==History==
He initially appeared in a cartoon strip called &quot;Der Globi&quot;, and later appeared in a cartoon picture-book form called &quot;Globi&#x27;s World Voyage&quot; in 1935. By 1944, the character gained so much popularity that Globus created a separate company for their mascot, and in 1948 Globi had sold over one million picture books. He was introduced in other markets such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil, but did not do as well. In the 1970s, he was accused of being sexist, racist, and promoting violence, which was based on the attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s, but the books in question were then withdrawn and revised.

==Present==
He is one of the most popular characters in the German-Speaking part of Switzerland, with sales of over 9 million books. However, he stays mostly unknown in the French and Italian speaking parts of the country.

In October 2003, a full-length film, &quot;Globi and the Stolen Shadows&quot; was made which was based on him. It was directed by Robi Engler in Anime-style. Beside the books, there is a lot of Globi merchandise, including cuddly toys, crockery, cutlery, clocks, school equipment, card games, food. Since December 2008, the Swiss town of Engelberg has hosted a Globi theme park in its Brunni area.

<doc id="1150170" wikidata="Q837284" url="?curid=1150170" title="Fructidor">
<text>Fructidor () is the twelfth month in the French Republican Calendar. The month was named after the Latin word &quot;fructus&quot; &#x27;fruit&#x27;.

Fructidor is the third month of the summer quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;été&quot;). By the Gregorian calendar, Fructidor starts on either August 18 or August 19 and ends exactly thirty days later, on September 16 or September 17. Fructidor follows the month of Thermidor and precedes the Sansculottides. 

The month is often used as a shorthand term for the Coup of 18 Fructidor.

== Day name table ==

Like all French Republican months, Fructidor lasted thirty days and was divided into three weeks called decades (&quot;décades&quot;) which each lasted ten days. Within every decade, each day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the fifth - the &quot;Quintidi&quot; - which had the name of an animal, and the tenth - the &quot;Decadi&quot; - which had the name of an agricultural tool.

<doc id="1150182" wikidata="Q5633082" url="?curid=1150182" title="HMS Leander (1780)">
<text>HMS &quot;Leander&quot; was a &quot;Portland&quot;-class 50-gun fourth rate of the Royal Navy, launched at Chatham on 1 July 1780. She served on the West Coast of Africa, West Indies, and the Halifax station. During the French Revolutionary Wars she participated in the Battle of the Nile before a French ship captured her. The Russians and Turks recaptured her and returned her to the Royal Navy in 1799. On 23 February 1805, while on the Halifax station, &quot;Leander&quot; captured the French frigate &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; and recaptured her prize, . On 25 April 1805, cannon fire from &quot;Leander&quot; killed an American seaman while &quot;Leander&quot; was trying to search an American vessel off the US coast for contraband. The resulting &quot;&quot;Leander&quot; affair&quot; contributed to the worsening of relations between the United States and Great Britain. In 1813, the Admiralty converted &quot;Leander&quot; to a hospital ship under the name &quot;Hygeia&quot;. &quot;Hygeia&quot; was sold in 1817.

==Early service==
She was commissioned in June 1780 under Captain Thomas Shirley. &quot;Leander&quot; cruised for some time in the North Sea.

At the end of 1781, &quot;Leander&quot; and the sloop-of-war sailed for the Dutch Gold Coast with a convoy, consisting of a few merchant-vessels and transports. Britain was at war with the Dutch Republic and Shirley launched an unsuccessful attack on 17 February on the Dutch outpost at Elmina, being repulsed four days later. &quot;Leander &quot; and Shirley then went on to capture the small Dutch forts at Moree (Fort Nassau – 20 guns), Kormantine (Courmantyne or Fort Amsterdam – 32 guns; 6 March), Apam (Fort Lijdzaamheid or Fort Patience – 22 guns; 16 March), Senya Beraku (Berricoe, Berku, Fort Barracco or Fort Goede Hoop – 18 guns; 23 March), and Accra (Fort Crèvecœur or Ussher Fort – 32 guns; 30 March). &quot;Leander&quot; also destroyed the French store-ship , off Senegal, supposed to be worth £30,000. Shirley garrisoned those facilities with personnel from Cape Coast.

Shirley sent two sets of dispatches back to Britain. One set went in the transport sloop &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which was under the command of Captain Frodsham. The French frigate &quot;Fée&quot; captured &quot;Ulysses&quot; and took her into Brest, but not before her captain had weighted the dispatches and thrown them overboard. Shirley&#x27;s first lieutenant, Mr. Van court, took the second set in the cartel transport &quot;Mackerel&quot;, which also carried the Dutch governors of the forts to Europe.

Shirley then sailed to the West Indies where towards the end of 1782 as senior captain he became commanding officer prior to the arrival of Admiral Hugh Pigot. Pigot promoted him to captain of the 90-gun .

Pigot appointed Captain John Willet Payne to replace Shirley. On 18 January 1783, &quot;Leander&quot; was escorting a cartel when the two vessels encountered a large French warship at midnight. After an inconclusive engagement of two hours, &quot;Leander&quot; and her opponent separated. Pigot reported that the French vessel was probably a 74-gun ship of the line. Furthermore, rumour had it that she was the &quot;Couronne&quot; and that she had gone on to Puerto Rico. On 4 March, &quot;Leander&quot; captured the brig &quot;Bella Juditta&quot;. &quot;Leander&quot; was one of the five warships and the armed storeship &quot;Sally&quot; that shared in the proceeds of the capture on 23 March of the ship &quot;Arend op Zee&quot;. Captain J. Reynolds took command briefly in 1784 before &quot;Leander&quot; was paid-off in Portsmouth in April.

She was recommissioned in August 1786, after repairs in 1785. Captain Sir James Barclay commissioned &quot;Leander&quot; in August 1786 and then sailed her for Nova Scotia on 9 April 1787. She served as flagship for Sir Herbert Sawyer in 1788 until paid off in September. Captain Joseph Peyton, Jr. immediately recommissioned her as the flagship for his father Rear-Admiral Joseph Peyton, Sr. She sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 December.

==French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars==
&quot;Leander&quot; was recommissioned in May 1795 under Captain Maurice Delgano. On 12 May 1796, she was part of Admiral Duncan&#x27;s squadron, when , of the squadron, captured the Dutch frigate &quot;Argo&quot; and the brig &quot;Mercury&quot;. The Royal Navy took both &quot;Argo&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot; into service: &quot;Argo&quot; became and &quot;Mercury&quot; became . &quot;Leander&quot; shared by agreement in the proceeds of the capture of the &quot;Vrow Hendrica&quot;, captured on 22 October.

In November 1796, &quot;Leander&quot; came under the command of Captain Thomas Boulden Thompson. She then escorted a convoy to Gibraltar on 7 January 1797.

&quot;Leander&quot; joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent, and was assigned to the squadron under Horatio Nelson. Thompson took part in Nelson&#x27;s attack on Santa Cruz in July 1797. Thompson was among the leaders of the landing parties, under the overall direction of Nelson and Thomas Troubridge. Wind hampered the initial attempts to force a landing; the Spanish defenders immediately subjected the successful landing in the evening of 22 July to heavy fire. Still, Thompson&#x27;s party were able to advance and spike several of the enemy&#x27;s cannon. However, the British forces had become dispersed throughout the town, and were forced to negotiate a truce to allow them to withdraw. Thompson himself was wounded in the battle. &quot;Leander&quot; lost seven men killed, 6 wounded (including Thompson), and one missing.

===Nile===
Under Captain Thomas Thompson &quot;Leander&quot; took part in the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. She was able to exploit a gap in the French line and anchor between &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; and , from which position she raked both enemy ships while protected from their broadsides. In the battle she suffered only 14 men wounded.

===Capture===
Carrying Nelson&#x27;s dispatches from the Nile and accompanied by Sir Edward Berry, &quot;Leander&quot; encountered the 74-gun French third rate off Crete on 18 August 1798. In the subsequent action, &quot;Leander&quot; lost 35 men killed and 57 wounded, including Thompson. The French suffered 100 killed and 180 wounded, but captured &quot;Leander&quot;. The French took her into service under her existing name.

The French treated the prisoners badly and plundered almost everything but the clothes the British had on their backs. When Thompson remonstrated with Captain Lejoille of &quot;Généreux&quot;, Lejoille answered nonchalantly, &quot;J&#x27;en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage.&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m sorry about that, but the fact is, the French are good at pillaging.&quot;) They refused treatment for Thompson, who had been badly wounded. &quot;Leander&quot;″s surgeon, Mr. Mulberry, was able to remove a musket ball from Thompson&#x27;s arm only after the vessels reached Corfu on 1 September and he was smuggled aboard the vessel where the French were holding Thompson. Most of the officers returned to Britain on parole but the French detained a number of seamen, and in particular Thomas Jarrat, the carpenter, after he refused to reveal to them the dimensions of &quot;Leander″&quot;s masts and spars. Captain Lejoille tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to get some of the British crew that he had detained to assist him when a Turko-Russian fleet appeared off Corfu. The British refused.

The subsequent court-martial aboard at Sheerness most honourably acquitted Thompson, his officers, and his crew. The court also thanked Berry for the assistance he gave during the battle. As Thompson was rowed back to shore, the crews of all the ships at Sheerness saluted him with three cheers. He was subsequently knighted and awarded a pension of £200 per annum.

&quot;Leander&quot; was at Corfu when a joint Russian and Ottoman force besieged the island. On 28 February 1799, the Russians and Ottomans attacked Vido, a small island (less than a kilometer across) at the mouth of the port of Corfu. A four-hour bombardment by several ships suppressed all five shore batteries on the island. &quot;Leander&quot; and the corvette &quot;Brune&quot; tried to intervene but were damaged and forced to retreat to the protection of the batteries of Corfu.

The Russians and Turks recaptured &quot;Leander&quot; and &quot;Brune&quot; when Corfu capitulated to them on 3 March 1799. The Russians restored &quot;Leander&quot; to the Royal Navy. They also gave &quot;Brune&quot; to the Ottomans.

===Return to British service===
&quot;Leander&quot; was recommissioned in the Mediterranean under Commander Adam Drummond in June 1799. In September Captain Michael Halliday took command.

From July 1801 to June 1802, she refitted at Deptford. She recommissioned in May under Captain James Oughton as flagship for Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell.

In July, she sailed for Halifax. Captain Francis Fane took command a year later, in August 1803, with Captain Alexander Skene replacing him in November. On 16 August 1804, &quot;Leander&quot; was in company with when they recaptured &quot;Hibberts&quot;.

She then had three more captains within the year: George Ralph Collier, Oughton again, and from November, John Talbot.

On 23 February 1805, while on the Halifax station, &quot;Leander&quot; discovered the French frigate &quot;Ville de Milan&quot;, under Captain Pierre Guillet, and the British , which &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; had captured the day before. The engagement between &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; had left both ships greatly damaged. Consequently, when they encountered &quot;Leander&quot; they struck to &quot;Leander&quot; without a fight. &quot;Leander&quot; came upon &quot;Cleopatra&quot; first, and as soon as she struck, the British prisoners on board her, i.e., her original crew, took possession of her. She then followed &quot;Leander&quot; towards &quot;Ville de Milan&quot;, which too struck. The Navy took &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; into service as .

On 3 June, &quot;Leander&quot; captured &quot;Nancy&quot;. Three days later she captured &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. The next day &quot;Leander&quot; captured &quot;Volunteer&quot;. On 12 October, &quot;Leander&quot; captured &quot;Vengeance&quot;. At some point &quot;Leander&quot; pressed a seaman from the crew of , which was returning to England from Suriname where she had delivered a cargo of slaves.

Thereafter, in recognition of the capture of &quot;Ville de Milan&quot; and the recapture of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the Admiralty promoted Talbot to command of ship of the line .

==The &quot;Leander&quot; affair==

HMS &quot;Leander&quot; then came under the command of Captains William Lyall and Henry Whitby. &quot;Leander&quot;, under Slingsby Simpson, and , under John Nairne, were repeatedly stationed off Sandy Hook, ostensibly to keep watch on two French frigates that had taken refuge in the harbour. However, in the summer of 1804, the warships began stopping and boarding all American ships going into New York just outside the United States&#x27;s three-mile territorial limit, and searching them for any French goods. If anything suspicious was found, the ship was detained and taken to Halifax.

On 25 April 1806, &quot;Leander&quot; fired a warning shot over the bow of a merchantman, signalling it to stop. The cannonball passed into the harbour, decapitating John Pierce, the helmsman of the &quot;Richard&quot;, a small coasting sloop inside the harbour. The sloop&#x27;s captain, who was Pierce&#x27;s brother, made his way to New York City, where he gathered a mob that paraded Pierce&#x27;s body and head through the streets. The next day, an angry mob intercepted a party from &quot;Leander&quot; returning to their ship with a load of provisions; the mob seized the provisions and placed them on twenty carts, the lead one bearing a pole flying an American flag and a British one below it. The carts were wheeled around the city as members of the mob beat drums. When the crowd reached Alms House, the provisions were given to the poor, and the British flag was burned. Protest meetings were held over the incident. John Pierce was given a large public funeral. Four of &quot;Leander&quot;″s officers caught ashore were imprisoned for their own protection, and were later secretly released. On 14 June, President Thomas Jefferson issued a proclamation against Captain Whitby. He ordered &quot;Leander&quot;, &quot;Driver&quot; and &quot;Cambrian&quot; immediately to quit US waters and forbade them ever to return. He extended the same prohibition to all vessels that Captains Whitby, John Nairne and Simpson might command. Whitby was court martialed in England on the charge of murdering John Pierce, but was acquitted.

On 26 April, &quot;Leander&quot;, &quot;Cambrian&quot; and &quot;Driver&quot; captured the American ship &quot;Aurora&quot;.

In May, Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys took command of &quot;Leander&quot; at Halifax as she became the flagship for Admiral George Berkeley. Captain Richard Raggett then sailed her back to Britain in 1807.

==Fate==
By 1807, &quot;Leander&quot; was out of commission at Portsmouth. In 1808, she was in Plymouth. In October 1810, &quot;Leander&quot; was fitted as a medical depot ship at Portsmouth. In 1813, the Admiralty commissioned a new so the old &quot;Leander&quot; was given the name &quot;Hygeia&quot;. &quot;Hygeia&quot; was sold on 14 April 1817 to a Mr. Thomas for £2,100.

New names for the calendar were suggested by Fabre d&#x27;Églantine on 24 October 1793 and on 24 November the National Convention accepted the names with minor changes.

<text>Christoph Straus (1575–1631) was an Austrian composer, cantor and organist. His church music includes polyphonic pieces and polychoral Masses, including a notable Requiem for high and low choirs. Although his textures were, by current standards, old-fashioned at the time, his word painting proves his acquaintance with the newest Italian music. He was employed as Court composer by Emperor Ferdinand II from 1616 to 1620 and rose to the post of Kapellmeister in St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral. He wrote 36 motets (published in 1613) and 16 surviving masses (1631). His later compositions require a wide variety of orchestral colours.

<text>Pluviôse (; also &quot;Pluviose&quot;) was the fifth month in the French Republican Calendar. The month was named after the Latin word &quot;pluviosus&quot; &#x27;rainy&#x27;.

Pluviôse was the second month of the winter quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;hiver&quot;), starting between the 20th and 22 January, and ending between the 18th and 20 February. It follows Nivôse and precedes Ventôse.

On October 24, 1793 Fabre d&#x27;Églantine suggested new names for the French Republican Calendar, and on the 24th November the National Convention accepted the names with minor changes. It was decided to omit the circumflex (&quot;accent circonflexe&quot;) in the names of the winter months, so the month was named &quot;Pluviose&quot; instead of &quot;Pluviôse&quot;. However, in historiography the spelling
&quot;Pluviôse&quot; is still preferred.

== Day name table ==

Like all FRC months Pluviôse lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks called &quot;décades&quot; (decades). Each day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal (Quintidi) or an agricultural tool (Decadi).

Different from the other months the rest of the days were not named after an agricultural plant, but after a mineral or animal substance. Fabre d&#x27;Églantine says about this topic:

<text>Frimaire () was the third month in the French Republican calendar. The month was named after the French word &quot;frimas&quot; &#x27;frost&#x27;.

Frimaire was the third month of the autumn quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;automne&quot;). It started between 21 November and 23 November, ending between 20 December and 22 December. It follows Brumaire and precedes Nivôse.

== Day name table ==

Like all FRC months, Frimaire lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks called &quot;décades&quot; (decades). Every day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal (Quintidi) or an agricultural tool (Decadi).

Other exceptions are the 8th day (Honey) and the 11th day (Wax). The original proposal of Fabre d&#x27;Églantine was Epicéa (Spruce) for the 8th and Thuya (White Cedar) for the 11th, but the National Convention shifted Honey and Wax from Nivôse to Frimaire thus foiling the original intention.

<doc id="1150215" wikidata="Q5455413" url="?curid=1150215" title="Fitch's paradox of knowability">
<text>Fitch&#x27;s paradox of knowability is a puzzle of epistemic logic. It provides a challenge to the &quot;knowability thesis&quot;, which states that every truth is, in principle, knowable. The paradox states that this assumption implies the &quot;omniscience principle&quot;, which asserts that every truth is known. Essentially, Fitch&#x27;s paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown truth is unknowable. So if all truths were knowable, it would follow that all truths are in fact known.

The paradox is of concern for verificationist or anti-realist accounts of truth, for which the &quot;knowability thesis&quot; is very plausible, but the omniscience principle is very implausible.

The paradox appeared as a minor theorem in a 1963 paper by Frederic Fitch, &quot;A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts&quot;. Other than the knowability thesis, his proof makes only modest assumptions on the modal nature of knowledge and of possibility. He also generalised the proof to different modalities. It resurfaced in 1979 when W. D. Hart wrote that Fitch&#x27;s proof was an &quot;unjustly neglected logical gem&quot;.

== Proof ==
Suppose &quot;p&quot; is a sentence that is an &quot;unknown truth&quot;; that is, the sentence &quot;p&quot; is true, but it is not &quot;known&quot; that &quot;p&quot; is true. In such a case, the sentence &quot;the sentence &quot;p&quot; is an unknown truth&quot; is true; and, if all truths are knowable, it should be possible to know that &quot;&quot;p&quot; is an unknown truth&quot;. But this isn&#x27;t possible, because as soon as we know &quot;&quot;p&quot; is an unknown truth&quot;, we know that &quot;p&quot; is true, rendering &quot;p&quot; no longer an &quot;unknown&quot; truth, so the statement &quot;&quot;p&quot; is an unknown truth&quot; becomes a falsity. Hence, the statement &quot;&quot;p&quot; is an unknown truth&quot; cannot be both known and true at the same time. Therefore, if all truths are knowable, the set of &quot;all truths&quot; must not include any of the form &quot;&quot;something&quot; is an unknown truth&quot;; thus there must be no unknown truths, and thus all truths must be known.

This can be formalised with modal logic. K and L will stand for &quot;known&quot; and &quot;possible&quot;, respectively. Thus LK means &quot;possibly known&quot;, in other words, &quot;knowable&quot;. The modality rules used are:

The proof proceeds:

The last line states that if &quot;p&quot; is true then it is known. Since nothing else about &quot;p&quot; was assumed, it means that every truth is known.

Since the above proof uses minimal assumptions about the nature of L, replacing L with F (see Prior&#x27;s tense logic (TL)) provides the proof for &quot;If all truth can be known in the future, then they are already known right now&quot;.

=== Generalisations ===
The proof uses minimal assumptions about the nature of K and L, so other modalities can be substituted for &quot;known&quot;. Joe Salerno gives the example of &quot;caused by God&quot;: rule (C) becomes that every true fact &quot;could have been&quot; caused by God, and the conclusion is that every true fact &quot;was&quot; caused by God. Rule (A) can also be weakened to include modalities that don&#x27;t imply truth. For instance instead of &quot;known&quot; we could have the doxastic modality &quot;believed by a rational person&quot; (represented by B). Rule (A) is replaced with:

This time the proof proceeds:

The last line matches line 6 in the previous proof, and the remainder goes as before. So if any true sentence could possibly be believed by a rational person, then that sentence is believed by one or more rational persons.

Some anti-realists advocate the use of intuitionistic logic; however, except for the last line, which moves from &quot;there are no unknown truths&quot; to &quot;all truths are known&quot;, the proof is, in fact, intuitionistically valid.

== The knowability thesis ==
Rule (C) is generally held to be at fault rather than any of the other logical principles employed. It may be contended that this rule does not faithfully translate the idea that all truths are knowable, and that rule (C) should not apply unrestrictedly. Kvanvig contends that this represents an illicit substitution into a modal context.

Gödel&#x27;s Theorem proves that in any recursively axiomatized system sufficient to derive mathematics (e.g. Peano Arithmetic), there are statements which are undecidable. In that context, it is difficult to state that &quot;all truths are knowable&quot; since some potential truths are uncertain.

However, jettisoning the knowability thesis does not necessarily solve the paradox, since one can substitute a weaker version of the knowability thesis called (C&#x27;).

The same argument shows that (C&#x27;) results in contradiction, indicating that any knowable truth is either known, or it is unknowable that it is an unknown yet knowable truth; conversely, it states that if a truth is unknown, then it is unknowable, or it is unknowable that it is knowable yet unknown.

<text>Chris Leitch (born April 1, 1979, in Pickerington, Ohio) is an American former soccer player who is currently the general manager and a former head coach for the San Jose Earthquakes.

==Career==

===College===
Leitch played college soccer at the University of North Carolina, leading them to the NCAA Championship in 2001, setting a school record for games played (88) and starts (87).

===Professional===
Leitch was drafted by Columbus Crew in the fourth round of the 2002 MLS SuperDraft, but only played 13 games for his hometown team in his first professional season.

Leitch was traded to the MetroStars with Jeff Matteo for Ross Paule prior to the 2003 season. He became a regular in the Metro lineup late in the year, playing in 15 games. He then became an automatic starter in 2004, playing every minute of all but a single game. Originally a right back, Leitch acquitted himself well on the left flank when the Metros needed help at that position. He switched back to the right flank in 2005. Despite being named the team&#x27;s Defender of the Year, he was waived by the club in the offseason and then came back to Columbus. He appeared in 24 matches in the 2006 season for his hometown club.
In the 2007 pre-season, Leitch was waived again, this time by the Crew as they sought to clear roster spots. He would return to the New York franchise, now New York Red Bulls, in July. The versatile defender appeared in 12 league matches for the club, starting 11. In 2008 Leitch appeared in 17 regular season matches. He helped the club reach the 2008 Western Conference Final, starting in both matches of the Red Bulls historic upset over defending champion Houston Dynamo (4–1 on aggregate). The following week he helped shut out Real Salt Lake 1–0 to help the Red Bulls reach the MLS Cup Final for the first time in club history.

Just prior to the start of the 2009 season on March 2, San Jose Earthquakes acquired Leitch in a trade with New York for an undisclosed sum of allocation money and one of the Earthquakes&#x27; eight international roster spots. Leitch had a career year with San Jose in 2009 appearing in 29 matches during the MLS regular season and contributing with 7 assists from his full back position.

Leitch remained with San Jose through the 2011 season. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Leitch was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in stage two of the draft on December 12, 2011. However, Leitch decided to retire rather than return for the 2012 season.

===Coaching===
On January 31, 2012, Leitch was named Technical Director for the San Jose Earthquakes Youth Development Academy.

On August 10, 2015, he was promoted to Technical Director for the San Jose Earthquakes proper, including the first team as well as the academy.

On June 25, 2017, he was named the head coach of the Earthquakes, replacing Dominic Kinnear. His coaching debut was San Jose&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Seattle Sounders FC in the knockout round of the U.S. Open Cup on June 28, advancing the Earthquakes to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2012 while also achieving the team&#x27;s first-ever victory over another MLS team during the Open Cup. Leitch&#x27;s first MLS match as head coach saw San Jose beat the LA Galaxy 2–1 at Stanford Stadium on July 1 off of a stoppage time winner from Shea Salinas.

He was replaced as San Jose&#x27;s head coach by Mikael Stahre on November 24, 2017, and thereafter returned to his former role as technical director.

On November 8, 2021, he was promoted from technical director to general manager of the San Jose Earthquakes.

<doc id="1150223" wikidata="Q5633083" url="?curid=1150223" title="HMS Leander (1813)">
<text>HMS &quot;Leander&quot; was a 50-gun spar-decked frigate (rated in the fourth rate) of the Royal Navy which saw service in the Napoleonic Wars, the War of 1812, and the Second Barbary War.

&quot;Leander&quot; and her near sister were a new type of ship in the Royal Navy, being exceptionally large and powerful frigates. They were ordered in response to the threat posed by the heavy American spar-decked frigates, during the War of 1812. &quot;Leander&quot; proved a successful ship, which operated in squadrons which chased the American frigates, but ultimately failed to catch them before the war ended. Refitted to serve as flagships for admirals on foreign stations, &quot;Leander&quot; saw action with Admiral Edward Pellew&#x27;s fleet at the bombardment of Algiers in 1816, firing over 3,000 round shot and sustaining severe casualties. She spent some time as the flagship on the North American Station, followed by in the East Indies, before returning to Britain in 1822 and being laid up the following year as a receiving ship. She spent the rest of her career in this role, until being broken up in 1830.

==Construction and commissioning==
HMS &quot;Leander&quot; was ordered from the Blackwall-based firm of Wigram, Wells &amp; Green on 6 May 1813. She was laid down in June 1813 and built of pitch pine to a design by William Rule. Built of softwood to get her into service as quickly as possible, &quot;Leander&quot; was launched on 10 November 1813, less than five months after laying down. She was moved to Woolwich Dockyard and completed there by 18 February 1814. The construction of fourth rates, a type that had fallen out of favour prior to the French Revolutionary Wars, was a response to the American spar-decked frigates, like . A spar-decked frigate was one with a continuous row of cannon on the uppermost deck, conventional frigates had an open waist amidships where no guns were mounted. Ordered alongside &quot;Leander&quot; was the similar 50-gun .

&quot;Leander&quot; was a spar-deck frigate, designed to carry thirty 24-pounder guns on her main deck, and twenty-six 42-pounder carronades on her spar deck, with four 24-pounders on her forecastle. This nominal armament was slightly altered during her 1813–18 commission, when two extra 24-pounders replaced two of the carronades on the spar deck. Unusually, the ship was designed with her upper gun ports directly above the lower, instead of offset. She was reported to be fast, exceeding 13 knots, but had a reputation for heavy and violent movements, probably due to poor stowage; this was fixed in her 1820 commission. In 1815, after the War of 1812 and Napoleonic Wars, &quot;Newcastle&quot; and &quot;Leander&quot; were fitted with accommodation for a flag officer with a poop deck built over the quarterdeck, and were mostly used as flagships on foreign stations, replacing older 50-gun ships that had previously filled this role. Both ships were re-rated as 60-gun fourth rates in February 1817.

&quot;Leander&quot; was commissioned under her first commander, Captain George Collier, in December 1813. Collier had commissioned &quot;Newcastle&quot; the previous month, but then moved to &quot;Leander&quot;.

==Service off America==
&quot;Leander&quot; went out to North America under Collier&#x27;s command, and formed part of a powerful squadron assigned to deal with the American super-frigates. Collier had previously served with distinction off the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, and the highly sought-after posting reflected the Admiralty&#x27;s approval of these efforts. He captured the on 22 June 1814. Collier sought battle with the , but the American ship escaped from Boston and evaded him. He gathered a squadron consisting of the &quot;Leander&quot;, &quot;Newcastle&quot; and the 40-gun , and set off in pursuit. He almost caught up with the &quot;Constitution&quot; off St Jago, but was unable to close on her due to the weather. The &quot;Constitution&quot; was at the time sailing with two captured British prizes, the former and . Collier&#x27;s three ships gave chase and were overhauling the &quot;Constitution&quot;, when, having allowed the &quot;Cyane&quot; to escape, the &quot;Levant&quot; broke away and Collier followed her. In doing so he retook the &quot;Levant&quot;, but allowed &quot;Constitution&quot; to escape. Collier continued to cruise in the area, but before he had another opportunity to pursue the &quot;Constitution&quot;, news reached him that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed and that the war was over.

&quot;Leander&quot; recaptured the British merchant vessel &quot;John&quot; on 4 January 1815, just before the end of the war.

==Later service==

&quot;Leander&quot;″s next commander, from August 1815, was Captain William Skipsey. She underwent a repair and refit at Woolwich between August 1815 and February 1816, after which she went out to the Mediterranean under Captain Edward Chetham. She was active in the Second Barbary War, as part of the British fleet under Admiral Edward Pellew. She took part in the bombardment of Algiers on 27 August 1816, firing 3,680 round shot and sustaining casualties of 17 men killed and 118 wounded.

&quot;Leander&quot; then became the flagship of the commander of the North American Station, Rear-Admiral Sir David Milne in 1817, and was based at Halifax. She was repaired at Portsmouth between July and November 1819, and recommissioned that year under Captain Charles Richardson. Richardson took her out to the East Indies as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood. &quot;Leander&quot; came briefly under the temporary command of Captain Price Blackwood between February and May 1822, and returned to England later that year. HMS &quot;Leander&quot; spent her final years as a receiving ship at Portsmouth between 1823 and 1830, and was broken up there in March 1830.

<text>USS &quot;Entemedor&quot; (SS-340), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the entemedor, a fish of the electric ray family found in shallow waters from Baja California to Panama.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;SS-340&quot;, originally named Chickwick, was renamed Entemedor on 24 September 1942 and launched on 17 December 1944 by the Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut, sponsored by Mrs. E. V. Izac; and commissioned on 6 April 1945.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

====World War II====
&quot;Entemedor&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 29 June 1945 from New London, en route to Midway Atoll for advanced training and to prepare for war patrols. She put to sea on her first war patrol on 24 July, and served as lifeguard for air strikes on Marcus Island before sailing on to patrol off Japan. When hostilities ceased, she was ordered to Saipan, where she arrived 17 August.

====Post-war====
The submarine returned to Seattle on 22 September 1945, and began a program of training operations along the west coast from San Diego. In 1946–1947, she made extended cruises in the Far East, basing at Subic Bay. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 10 December 1948.

Recommissioned on 24 October 1950, &quot;Entemedor&quot; trained off the coast of California, and on 2 January 1951 sailed for New London and through the remainder of the year operated in the Atlantic. On 31 January 1952, she entered the Electric Boat Co.&#x27;s yard for an extensive GUPPY IIA modernization, was placed in commission in reserve on 28 February 1952, and returned to active status 17 October 1952.

Every second year beginning in 1953, &quot;Entemedor&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean to serve with the 6th Fleet, and from her home port at New London also sailed for a midshipman cruise to northern European ports in the summer of 1958, and the Isle of Portland, England, in February 1960. Her stateside operations included participation in large-scale exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean, and serving as target for Task Force &quot;Alfa&quot;, in development of antisubmarine warfare techniques. Through 1962 she continued to operate from New London.

&quot;Entemedor&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1972.

===Turkish Navy===

&quot;Entemedor&quot; was transferred to Turkey under the terms of the Security Assistance Act on 24 August 1972 and renamed TCG &quot;Preveze&quot; (S 345), the second Turkish Navy submarine of that name. She was sold to Turkey on 1 August 1973. She was decommissioned and struck from the rolls of the Turkish Navy in 1987.

==Awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal
* World War II Victory Medal
* Navy Occupation Service Medal with &quot;ASIA&quot; and &quot;EUROPE&quot; clasps
* National Defense Service Medal with star

==Miscellaneous==
A bronze plaque from the ship was purchased by contestants in an episode of the British TV show Bargain Hunt for £20, then sold at auction for £35.

<text>Judgement Records is a record label, started by Joe Nicolo after Ruffhouse Records was dissolved.

Kris Kross followed Nicolo to his new label. Artists also included Ced, The Co-Defendants, and GOAT. Joe became “Joe the Butcher” around 1982 when editing tape for the late producer Ray Monahan, who said: “You need a nickname. The way you chop up tape, let’s call you ‘Joe the Butcher.’”

Joe said, “Perfect, because my father literally was ‘Joe the butcher.’” In fact, since Studio 4 moved to suburban Conshohocken in 1994, it has been located across the street from what was Joe Sr.’s butcher shop for 35 years.

Joe and Schoolly D-manager Chris Schwartz started Ruffhouse Records in 1986 to capitalize on the wealth of rap talent from the Philly area. In the late &#x27;80s Joe produced, engineered or mixed (for other labels) &quot;Schoolly&quot;, &quot;the 7A3&quot;, &quot;Steady B&quot;, &quot;Blackmale&quot;, &quot;Roxanne Shante&quot; and many others, establishing his rap rep.

After foundering under an onerous distribution deal with Enigma Records in 1987 and 1988, Ruffhouse came to fruition when distribution was switched to Columbia. The label&#x27;s first release was Cheba&#x27;s &quot;The Piper&quot; in 1990, and their first hit was Tim Dog&#x27;s &quot;Fuck Compton&quot; (with Joe mixing) which topped the rap charts in 1991 and fueled the East/West rap wars.

The label came into its own with the release of the first &quot;Cypress Hill&quot; album, a double-platinum slice of THC-soaked L.A. Latino rap, exec-produced and mixed by Joe. One of Ruffhouse&#x27;s biggest hits came in 1992 with Kris Kross, a pair of Atlanta 12-year-olds under the wing of Jermaine Dupri (with Joe and Phil engineering and mixing, and Joe exec-producing), released the quadruple-platinum &quot;Totally Krossed Out&quot; (No. 1).

The label&#x27;s other commercial and critical cow has been the Fugees, whose The Score went 7 X&#x27;s-platinum in 1996; solo releases from Fugees Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill (6 Million), and Pras have all succeeded as well. Ruffhouse Records went on to sell over 100 million records worldwide. Joe has 9 Grammy wins and in April 2003 was given the Hero&#x27;s Award from the Grammy organization.

Joe has since gone on to moviemaking and has made several films including &quot;Shade&quot; starring Sly Stallone and Jamie Foxx, and &quot;One Part Sugar&quot; starring Danny DeVito.

<text>Westbourne Grove is a retail road running across Notting Hill, an area of west London. Its western end is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and its eastern end is in the City of Westminster; it runs from Kensington Park Road in the west to Queensway in the east, crossing over Portobello Road. It contains a mixture of independent and chain retailers, and has been termed both &quot;fashionable&quot; and &quot;up-and-coming&quot;.

The Notting Hill Carnival passes along the central part of Westbourne Grove.

==Shopping==

There are a number of popular shopping destinations located on Westbourne Grove and adjoining streets, pre-eminently: Portobello Market, Queensway and Ledbury Road.

On 9 August 1997, authoritative weekly newsagent-magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; featured West London, selecting Westbourne Grove as the half-city&#x27;s representative: &quot;&quot;Seeking a key shopping road symbolic of western aspirations, we decided that preposterously fashionable Westbourne Grove, or &#x27;Westbourne Village&#x27;, has it all. It was here that Madonna headed during breaks in filming &quot;Evita&quot; - to the funky boutiques, the avant-garde florists, the designer jewellery and futuristic furniture (at millennial prices).&quot;&quot;

In February 2004, the London Plan was first issued and, paired with Queensway, designated Westbourne Grove as one of Greater London&#x27;s major centres.

Around 2007, the road&#x27;s eastern Bayswater-end, underwent a rapid period of transformation, east of Chepstow Road. Upon lease expiry, rents increased significantly and pricing-out many incumbent family businesses, which were replaced by fashionable / prestige restaurants and shops.

==History==

The development of Westbourne Grove began in the 1840s and proceeded from the east (which lay in Bayswater) to the west, where it became the principal east–west artery into the Ladbroke Estate. The far western end of the street only became known as Westbourne Grove relatively recently in 1938, having previously been called Archer Street. In 1926, the novelist A.J. Cronin opened his own medical practice at 152 Westbourne Grove.

Westbourne Grove takes its name from Westbourne Green – a settlement that developed to the west of the bourne that later took the name River Westbourne. This river currently runs underground at Ossington Street. The area is first recorded in 1222 as Westeburn. Westbourne Green is first recorded as Westborne Grene in 1548. Westbourne Green formed part of the parish of Paddington.

There was a small settlement to the north of what is now Westbourne Grove at Westbourne Green. It had five main houses. The largest of these was Westbourne Place or Westbourne House, which was rebuilt in 1745 by the architect Isaac Ware as an elegant Georgian mansion of three storeys with a frontage of nine windows divided into three parts. The central third was topped by a large pediment and contained the main door, which also had a pediment over it. The lower two storeys were formed into bays at each end, which contained three windows each. Amongst the well-known residents of this house were Sir William Yorke, baronet; the Venetian ambassador; the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (a great great nephew of the diarist Samuel Pepys); and the General Commander in Chief of the Army, Viscount Hill, who left in 1836 (and who gave his name to the modern road bridge north of Westbourne Grove called Lord Hill&#x27;s Bridge). The house was demolished in 1836 to make way for the houses and gardens of what is now Westbourne Park Villas. Thomas Hardy lived in this area, mainly at no 16 Westbourne Park Villas, which was his home 1863–67.

Also north of what is now Westbourne Grove was Westbourne Farm which was the home, between 1815 and 1817, of the actress Sarah Siddons, who lived there with her daughter. The Farm was at the point where the Harrow Road, the Westway and the canal converge. Mrs Siddons was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, the main church of Paddington, on Paddington Green, where her grave can still be seen.

Though now popular and expensive for home-buyers, much of the area had become run-down in the 1950s, when it was the centre of the activities of notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman, after whom the phrase &quot;Rachmanism&quot; was coined. He was known for his violent evictions of tenants with legally fixed rents. He replaced them—in what had become overcrowded multi-occupied housing—mainly with recent migrants from the West Indies who, because of discrimination and council tenant restrictions, could not find accommodation. He operated from an office in Westbourne Grove. Part of the area, including streets between Ledbury Rd &amp; Shrewsbury Road to the south of Westbourne Park Road, became derelict and was consequently compulsorily purchased and demolished.

Notting Hill Post Office, in Westbourne Grove, finally closed in a storm of controversy during early 2005. However, the Royal Mail retained its sorting office on the site.

John Lanchester, in &quot;The Guardian&quot; (6 January 2012), observed Westbourne Grove to be &quot;an area that in the last couple of decades has gone from slightly rough to full-on trustafarian to total bankerisation.&quot;

<doc id="1150242" wikidata="Q1756015" url="?curid=1150242" title="Opisthotonus">
<text>Opisthotonus or opisthotonos (from and ) is a state of severe hyperextension and spasticity in which an individual&#x27;s head, neck and spinal column enter into a complete &quot;bridging&quot; or &quot;arching&quot; position.

This extreme arched pose is an extrapyramidal effect and is caused by spasm of the axial muscles along the spinal column. It has been shown to occur naturally in birds, snakes suffering from advanced boid inclusion body disease, and placental mammals, among existing animals; it is observed in some articulated dinosaur fossils.

==Causes==
Opisthotonus is a symptom of some cases of severe cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury or as a result of the severe muscular spasms associated with tetanus. It can be a feature of severe acute hydrocephalus, poisoning, and drowning.

===Infants===
Opisthotonus is more pronounced in infants. Opisthotonus in the neonate may be a symptom of meningitis, tetanus, severe kernicterus, or the rare maple syrup urine disease. This marked extensor tone can cause infants to &quot;rear backwards&quot; and stiffen out as the mother or nurse attempts to hold or feed them. Individuals with opisthotonus are quite challenging to position, especially in wheelchairs and car seats.

Opisthotonus can be triggered by any attempt at movement, such as smiling, feeding, speech, or by involuntary movement, such as seizures. A similar tonic posturing may be seen in Sandifer syndrome.

===Poisoning===
Opisthotonus can sometimes be seen in lithium intoxication. It is a rare extrapyramidal side effect of phenothiazines, haloperidol, and metoclopramide.

Opisthotonus with the presence of the risus sardonicus is also a symptom of strychnine poisoning and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) poisoning.

===Drowning and the &quot;dinosaur death pose&quot;===
Opisthotonus is seen with drowning victims – called the &quot;opisthotonic death pose&quot;. This pose is also common in complete dinosaur skeletal fossils and it has been suggested that this is due to the animal drowning or being immersed in water soon after death.

===Vivisection===
Opisthotonus can be produced experimentally in animals by transection of the midbrain (between the superior colliculus and the inferior colliculus), which results in severing all the corticoreticular fibers.

Severe &quot;arching&quot; (hyperextension) occurs due to stimulus by the anterior reticulospinal tract caused by the loss of the balancing inhibitory counter-stimulus of corticoreticular fibers, which normally act upon the pons reticular formation.

===Other causes===
Opisthotonus is also described as a potential CNS symptom of heat stroke along with bizarre behavior, hallucinations, decerebrate rigidity, oculogyric crisis, and cerebellar dysfunction.

Opisthotonus is a symptom of &quot;lavender foal syndrome&quot;, a lethal genetic disorder in horses.

Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, introduced thiamine-deprived pigeons as a model for understanding how thiamine deficiency can lead to the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Feeding them polished rice caused opisthotonos, and if not treated they died after a few days. Administration of thiamine at the stage of opisthotonos led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were observed in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical lesion.

<text>Joy Page (born Joy Cerrette Paige; November 9, 1924 – April 18, 2008) was an American actress. She is best known for her role as the Bulgarian refugee Annina Brandel in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). She was sometimes credited as Joanne Page.

==Early life==
Page was the daughter of Mexican-American silent film star Don Alvarado (born José Ray Paige, in New Mexico) and Ann Boyar, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. Her parents divorced when she was eight. 

In 1936, her mother married Jack L. Warner, then head of Warner Bros. studios. Warner, however, did not encourage his stepdaughter&#x27;s interest in acting. 

==Career==
Page, who initially thought the script to &quot;Casablanca&quot; was &quot;old fashioned&quot; and &quot;clichéd&quot;, landed the role of Annina Brandel on her own and Warner reluctantly approved. She was only seventeen and fresh out of high school. Page, along with Dooley Wilson and Humphrey Bogart, were the only American-born feature actors in the film.

Warner, however, refused to sign Page to a contract, and she never appeared in another Warner Bros. film. She went on to act in a number of films for other studios, including a featured role in her next film, &quot;Kismet&quot; in 1944. She was usually billed as Joanne Page, and also made some television appearances. In 1945, Page married actor William T. Orr. He became a Warner Bros. executive, leading to accusations of nepotism. She retired from acting after appearing in the first season of Disney&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot; in 1959. The year before, in her final film role, she played Prairie Flower, a Sioux Indian and mother of White Bull, played by Sal Mineo, in &quot;Tonka&quot;.. She also appeared in episode 22 of &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as the wife of Bill Tawnee (&quot;The Bill Tawnee Story&quot;).

==Personal life==
Page married actor William T. Orr in 1945. She died on April 18, 2008, of complications arising from a stroke and pneumonia.

<doc id="1150263" wikidata="Q312969" url="?curid=1150263" title="Oleg Antonov (aircraft designer)">
<text>Oleg Konstantinovich Antonov (, ; 7 February 1906 – 4 April 1984) was a Soviet aeroplane designer, and the founder of the Research and Design Bureau No. 153 (OKB-153) in Novosibirsk, Russia, latter moved to Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, and named in his honour after his death. Antonov designed a number of Soviet aeroplanes (such as the Antonov An-2, Antonov An-12) and numerous gliders for both civilian and military use.

==Early life==
Antonov was born on 7 February 1906 in Troitsy, Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire (now Podolsky District of the Moscow Oblast), Russian Empire to a family of Russian ethnicity. In 1912, the Antonovs moved to Saratov, where he attended the non-classical secondary school (now gymnasium №1) and secondary school (now school №23). From an early age, Antonov was fascinated with aviation and spent much of his spare time at the local airfield.

==Early engineering career==
At the age of 17, Antonov founded the &quot;Amateur Aviation Club&quot; and later joined the &quot;Organization of Friends of the Air Force&quot;. Later he designed the OKA-1 &quot;Pigeon&quot;, a glider that was entered in a competition in Moscow where he won the first prize, a flight on a Junkers 12 aircraft.

In 1930, Antonov graduated from the Kalinin Polytechnical Institute in Leningrad. He continued to design gliders and in 1931 Antonov became the chief designer at the Moscow Glider Factory. During the next eight years, he designed 30 different gliders including the Standard-1, Standard-2, OKA-6 and the large &quot;City of Lenin&quot; glider. Due to a requirement that all pilots in the Soviet Union had to begin their flight training in gliders, Antonov was able to produce up to 8,000 gliders per year.

In 1938, after an incident when an instructor defected to the West using a glider, the Soviet government reversed its decision regarding glider training, banned the sport of gliding and shut down the Moscow Glider Factory.

==Professional designer career and World War II==
Following the closure of the glider factory in 1938, he unsuccessfully applied to enter Zhukovsky Air Academy the same year. He then in 1940 joined Yakovlev&#x27;s Sportsplane Factory and there, after receiving two aircraft from Germany in June 1940, he was assigned to prepare the German Fi 156 Storch for production in Kaunas. He was also tasked with designing an ambulance version of the aircraft.

Antonov was appointed chief designer for the Yakovlev Design Bureau. In 1940 a new aircraft design bureau under his own management was established in Leningrad. The German invasion resulted in the closure of the plant and he was reassigned to work on the A-7 glider. The factory was later reorganised to produce A-7s.

During World War II, the A-7 was used for airbridge supply of the Soviet partisans behind the front lines. Antonov also worked on the Antonov A-40 biplane glider that was designed to airlift tanks, but this project proved unsuccessful. In total during the war around 450 A-7s were produced. In 1943, Antonov returned to the Yakovlev design bureau to fill a vacancy as Yakovlev&#x27;s first deputy designer. He was put in charge of Yak-3 and also of production at Novosibirsk. Much of his time and energy was devoted to the improvement of the Yak series, one of the most mass-produced fighter aircraft types of World War II.

==Postwar career and establishment of the Antonov Design Bureau==
After the war, Antonov requested that Yakovlev let him work independently, heading Yakovlev&#x27;s subsidiary design office at the aircraft manufacturing factory at Novosibirsk. On 31 May 1946, Antonov was appointed head of the newly redesignated facility (subsequently known as the Antonov Research and Design Bureau), which was later moved to Kiev, Ukrainian SSR. In September 1946, Antonov, in addition to his management of the design bureau, became the director of the Siberian R&amp;D Institute for Aeronautics.

The first of the Antonov Bureau&#x27;s designs was the SKh-1 (Sel′sko Khozyaystvennyi- pervoy - agricultural-first one) agricultural aircraft, later redesignated An-2, designed to meet a 1947 Soviet requirement for a replacement for the Polikarpov Po-2 which was used in large numbers as both an agricultural aircraft and a utility aircraft. Antonov designed a large single-bay biplane of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit and a cabin accommodating 12 passengers.

A series of significant transports followed under Oleg Antonov&#x27;s direction. Antonov aircraft (design office prefix An-) range from a rugged An-2 (which itself is comparatively large for a biplane) through the An-28 reconnaissance aircraft to the massive An-124 Ruslan strategic airlifter. The quad-turboprop An-12 and its derivatives became the primary Soviet military transport from 1959 onward. While less well known, the An-24, An-26, An-30 and An-32 family of twin-turboprop, high winged, passenger/cargo/troops aircraft predominate in domestic/short-haul air services in the former Soviet Union and parts of the world formerly under Soviet influence. Antonov also oversaw development of the mid-range An-72/An-74 jet airplanes family. The world&#x27;s largest production aircraft, the An-124 Ruslan, flew for the first time in 1982, and its specialised shuttle-carrying/extra-heavy cargo derivative, the An-225 Mriya entered development, still under Antonov&#x27;s guidance, but did not make its maiden flight until 1989 after his death. In November 2004, FAI placed the An-225 in the Guinness Book of Records for its 240 records. Some of Antonov&#x27;s designs are also built abroad, such as the Shaanxi Y-8.

In 1965 Antonov signed a petition in defense of Soviet dissident Ivan Dziuba.

==Family==
Antonov was married three times (to Elena Kochetkova, Yelyzaveta Shahatuni, and Elvira Antonova) and was the father of four children (Rolan, Anna, Elena, and Andrei).

==Death==
Oleg Antonov died 4 April 1984 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, and was buried in Baikove Cemetery.

==Honorary titles, awards and legacy==
During his lifetime, Antonov was recognized as a Doctor of Science, Academician of the Academy of Science of the Ukrainian SSR (1968), Hero of Socialist Labor (1966), and elected member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the 5th, 6th and 7th convocations.

Among numerous awards, Antonov received the State Award of the USSR in 1952 and Lenin Award in 1962.

Antonov was decorated with three Orders of Lenin, the Order of the October Revolution, the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Medal &quot;Partisan of the Patriotic War&quot; 1st class.
A street in Kyiv&#x27;s Solomyanka neighborhood is named after Oleg Antonov.

In 1999, Antonov was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

A coin was minted of copper nickel alloy in 2006 by the National Bank of Ukraine honoring Antonov. In addition, a silver proof coin was issued by the Bank of Russia to commemorate 100 years since Antonov&#x27;s birth.

<doc id="1150269" wikidata="Q733585" url="?curid=1150269" title="Tony Snow">
<text>Robert Anthony Snow (June 1, 1955 – July 12, 2008) was an American journalist, political commentator, anchor, columnist, musician, and the 25th White House Press Secretary under President George W. Bush, from May 2006 until his resignation in September 2007. Snow also worked for the President George H. W. Bush as chief speechwriter and Deputy Assistant of Media Affairs, from 1991 to 1993.

Between his two White House stints, Snow was a broadcaster and newspaper columnist. After years of regular guest-hosting for &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; and providing news commentary for National Public Radio, he launched his own talk radio program, &quot;The Tony Snow Show&quot;, which went on to become nationally syndicated. He was also a regular personality on Fox News Channel beginning in 1996, hosting &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; and &quot;Weekend Live&quot;, and often substituting as host of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. In April 2008, Snow briefly joined CNN as a commentator. 

He also made several notable speeches, including keynote addresses at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2007 and 2008. In his journalistic and governmental capacities, Snow generally supported conservative causes.

==Early life and education ==
Snow was born in Berea, Kentucky, and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, Jim, was a social studies teacher, guidance counselor, and an assistant principal at Princeton High School. His mother was an inner-city nurse who died of colon cancer in 1973, when Snow was 17. Snow developed an early interest in journalism, public policy, and politics, and was editor of his high school newspaper.

After graduating from Princeton High School in 1973, Snow obtained in 1977 a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Davidson College in North Carolina. He then taught physics in high school. He attended graduate programs in philosophy and economics at the University of Chicago.

In Ohio, Snow originally registered to vote as a Democrat. He was a convert to Roman Catholicism.

==Career==

=== Journalism and broadcasting ===

Snow began his journalism career in 1979 as an editorial writer for &quot;The Greensboro Record&quot; in Greensboro, North Carolina, next working as an editorial writer at &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; in Norfolk, Virginia (1981–82), editorial page editor of &quot;The Daily Press&quot; in Newport News (1982–84), deputy editorial page editor of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; (1984–87), and editorial page editor of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; (1987–91). 

In 1991, Snow took a sabbatical from journalism to work in the White House for President George H. W. Bush, first as chief speechwriter (Deputy Assistant to the President for Communications and Director of Speechwriting) and later as Deputy Assistant to the President for Media Affairs (1992–1993).

From 1993 to 2000, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; published his commentaries, and from 1994 to 2000 he was a Counterpoint Columnist for &quot;USA Today&quot;. Snow also wrote a syndicated column for Creators Syndicate between 1993 and 2000; his commentaries appeared in more than 200 newspapers nationwide. Snow won numerous awards during his print career, including those from the Virginia Press Association, the Detroit Press Club, the Society of Professional Journalists, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, The Associated Press, and Gannett.

Snow appeared on radio and television programs worldwide including &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, &quot;The MacNeil–Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Until 1994, Snow was the writer, correspondent and host of the PBS news special &quot;The New Militant Center&quot;.

From 1996 to 2003, Snow was the first host of &quot;FOX News Sunday&quot;, a Sunday morning interview and roundtable program produced by Fox News, airing on affiliates of the Fox Broadcasting Company and later in the day on Fox News Channel.

Snow was the primary guest host of Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s program beginning in the mid-1990s. He was also a frequent commentator on National Public Radio. Snow&#x27;s own &quot;Tony Snow Show&quot; on Fox News Radio premiered in late 2003. It ended when he became White House Press Secretary in April 2006.

=== White House Press Secretary ===
In April 2006, Snow was named White House Press Secretary in the George W. Bush administration, replacing Scott McClellan. His appointment to the position was formally announced on April 26, 2006. His selection was initially criticized because of some of his past comments about Bush. Bush acknowledged Snow&#x27;s criticisms during the announcement of Snow&#x27;s appointment, saying that Snow was &quot;not afraid to express his own opinions&quot;.

Snow began his new press secretary duties on May 8, 2006. He decided to leave the position of press secretary after new White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten asked all staff members to either commit to staying through the end of Bush&#x27;s second term, in January 2009, or to leave by Labor Day of 2007. On September 13, 2007, Snow gave his final press briefing, saying that he would miss the duties of his position, and that &quot;I love these briefings&quot;.

==Personal life==
Snow was an avid musician. He played the trombone, flute, piccolo, saxophone, and guitar, and belonged to a cover band, Beats Workin&#x27;, which featured fellow Washington, D.C.-area professionals. Beats Workin&#x27; played publicly with a number of rock bands, including Snow&#x27;s friends Skunk Baxter (The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan) and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. Snow was featured on an episode of VH1 Classic&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp&quot;.

=== Illness and death ===
In February 2005, while still at Fox News, Snow was diagnosed with colon cancer. He returned to broadcasting in April 2005 after undergoing surgery. On March 23, 2007, after almost a year as press secretary, Snow once again took a leave of absence to seek treatment for recurrent cancer. Treatment for the spreading cancer in his final few months forced periodic absences from Snow&#x27;s duties as press secretary, his subsequent position as a CNN commentator, and his public speaking engagements.

On July 12, 2008, Snow died at Georgetown University Hospital as a result of colon cancer that had spread to his liver. He was 53 years old. Reacting to Snow&#x27;s death, President George W. Bush praised Snow&#x27;s ability to bring &quot;a certain civility to this very contentious job&quot;.

<doc id="1150283" wikidata="Q885639" url="?curid=1150283" title="Harrison Reed (politician)">
<text>Harrison Jackson Reed (August 26, 1813May 25, 1899) was an American editor and politician who had most of his political career in Florida. He was elected in 1868 as the ninth Governor of Florida, serving until 1873 during the Reconstruction era. Born in Littleton, Massachusetts, he moved as a youth with his family to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he had a grocery store and started farming. He also owned and edited the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; for several years.

Reed became active in the Republican Party and in 1861 he began his political career, moving to Washington, DC for a patronage job in the Treasury Department. In 1863 he was appointed as the Tax Commissioner of Florida, to oversee confiscation and sales of Confederate properties in Union-occupied areas. In 1865 he was appointed as Postal Agent for the state. In 1868 he was elected as Governor under the new constitution, which enfranchised freedmen. He served one term, with challenges by factions of the Republican Party resulting in two attempts in the state senate at impeachment. He strongly supported public education, where the growth in new schools served one-quarter of the children by 1872.

==Early life and education==
Harrison was one of eight Reed children, born on August 26, 1813, in Littleton, Massachusetts, to parents Seth Reed (1781–1848) and Rhoda (Finney) Reed (1781–1874). The Reed family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1836, where his siblings contributed to the newly developing areas and two brothers became politicians. His brothers were Herbert Reed, who became a grocer in Milwaukee and married Phebe Adeline Brisbane; Orson Reed of Summit, Wisconsin, who married Agnes Fairservice; Curtis Reed, who served as a state legislator; and George B. Reed, who became a judge and politician in Wisconsin. His sisters married substantial men: Mary Augusta Reed (1811–1866) married Judge Abram Daniel Smith (1811-1865); Martha (1817–1902) married Alexander Mitchell (1817–1887), who became a banker and railroad tycoon; and Julia Ann married Dr. Thomas J. Noyes, who became the first president of the Milwaukee Academy of Medicine.

At age 16, Harrison had been apprenticed to a printer, but health problems caused him to quit. When his family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he became a merchant there, opening the first general store. He also started the first Sunday school. After his business failed in the Panic of 1837, he took a turn at farming.

He also became an early owner and editor of the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; in the city, publishing it from December 1837 until May 1842. He co-published the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; in Madison with David Atwood from 1859 to 1861.

On August 12, 1841, he married Amanda Anna Louisa Turner in Milwaukee. Together, they helped settle the towns of Neenah and Menasha. They had four children, one of whom died before the age of two.

==Politics and moves==
After joining the Republican Party in 1861, Reed moved to Washington, D.C., for a job that he had obtained at the Treasury Department. While they were living in Washington, his wife Amanda died on October 13, 1862.

In 1863, Reed was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to be the Tax Commissioner in Florida to deal with sales and disposition of confiscated Confederate property. While working as Tax Commissioner, Reed traveled to Fernandina Beach on Amelia Island, which was occupied by Union forces, to oversee use of Confederate properties. There he met Chloe Merrick, who was teaching freedmen children, and was working to set up an orphanage. The widower was very impressed with Merrick, a young teacher from Syracuse, New York.

In 1869, Reed encountered Chloe Merrick again, who had moved to North Carolina for her health and was again teaching freed children. He proposed marriage to her. They were married at the home of Merrick&#x27;s sister and brother-in-law in Syracuse, New York, on August 10, 1869. They had a son Harrison, Jr. together.

In 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Reed as the Postal Agent for Florida. He continued to be involved with postwar development in the state.

During the Reconstruction era, in 1868 Florida enacted a new constitution, which extended the franchise to freedmen. Most joined the Republican Party, which had emancipated them. Reed was elected governor under the new constitution. In the election, Reed received 14,421 votes and his Democratic Party opponent (George Washington Scott) received 7,731 votes. Reed assumed office on June 8, 1868. The results were disputed by the Democrats. It was not until July 4, 1868, that the federal commander of military forces in Florida for Reconstruction recognized the constitution and the election as valid. Florida was readmitted to the Union at that time. Although the military forces in Florida were to leave on July 4, 1868 (following the restoration to the Union), Reed requested the continuation of Union forces.

Reed appointed Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs as Florida&#x27;s first African-American Secretary of State, and also commissioned Gibbs as a lieutenant colonel in the Florida State Militia. He had a tumultuous tenure, with opposition from factions of the Republican Party. They made two attempts to pass impeachment resolutions in the state Senate against him.

In the first effort, the state Senate voted for his impeachment in November 1868, and William Henry Gleason, his lieutenant governor from 1868 to 1870, proclaimed himself as Governor. The state adjutant general and the sheriff of Leon County, Alvin B. Munger, a former US Army officer, supported Reed and organized an effort to deny Gleason access to the Capitol. On November 24, 1868, the Florida Supreme Court held that the Senate had lacked a quorum at their vote and could not have impeached Reed. Gleason was forced out.

During the Senate&#x27;s second attempt to impeach Reed, Lieutenant Governor Samuel T. Day claimed to be Acting Governor from February 10 to May 4, 1872, while the senate was conducting hearings and voting. While his impeachment was pending, Reed had felt he was disqualified from holding office, and left the capital. The Legislature adjourned without bringing him to trial, which he construed as equivalent to acquittal. While Day was in Jacksonville for a party caucus, Reed returned to Tallahassee, declared himself Governor, and appointed a new Attorney General. Reed&#x27;s proclamation was approved by the Secretary of State and upheld by the State Supreme Court.

Reed served as governor until January 7, 1873. He is believed to have been influenced by his wife&#x27;s interest in education and alleviating poverty. After their marriage, he supported founding a state university, and gave strong support to public education. It was established for the first time in the state by the Reconstruction legislature. From 1870 to 1872, the number of public schools in the state increased from 270 to 444, and the number of children served grew from 7500 to 16,258, roughly one-quarter of the population of student age.

After holding office, Reed acquired a farm south of Jacksonville, along the St. Johns River. He returned to journalism, editing a local magazine, &quot;The Semi-Tropical.&quot; Although he struggled financially, he and Chloe Merrick Reed were active in civic affairs. In 1889 Reed was appointed as US Postmaster of Tallahassee by President Benjamin Harrison, serving for the remainder of his administration. Reed&#x27;s final public service was to represent Duval County in Florida&#x27;s House of Representatives until his death in Jacksonville on May 25, 1899. He was buried there in the Oaklawn Cemetery.

==Honors==
Reed Street in Jacksonville, Florida is named for him.

<text>HMNZS &quot;Leander was a [[light cruiser]] which served with the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was the [[lead ship]] of the . The ship initially served asHMS &quot;Leander in the Royal Navy before her transfer to New Zealand in 1937. In 1945, the ship was returned to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Leander&quot; and was involved in the Corfu Channel incident. The ship was scrapped in 1950.

== History ==
&quot;Leander&quot; was launched at Devonport on 24 September 1931. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Leander&quot; on 24 March 1933. Along with she served in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. In August 1937 &quot;Leander&quot;, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and on each island a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: &quot;This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI.&quot;

In World War II, &quot;Leander&quot; served initially in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Commander Stephen Roskill, in later years the Royal Navy&#x27;s Official Historian, was posted as the ship&#x27;s executive officer in 1941. In the action on 27 February 1941, she sank the Italian armed merchantman near the Maldives, rescuing 113 of her crew and taking slight damage. On 23 March 1941, &quot;Leander&quot; intercepted and captured the Vichy French merchant &quot;Charles L.D.&quot; in the Indian Ocean between Mauritius and Madagascar. On 14 April, &quot;Leander&quot; deployed for support of military operations in Persian Gulf and, on 18 April, joined the aircraft carrier and the light cruiser . On 22 April, &quot;Leander&quot; was released from support duties in the Persian Gulf and took part in search for German raider south of the Maldives. 

In June 1941, &quot;Leander&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and was active against the Vichy French during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. After serving in the Mediterranean, &quot;Leander&quot; returned to the Pacific Ocean in September 1941. In 1941 the New Zealand Division became the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and she was commissioned as HMNZS &quot;Leander&quot; in September 1941. 

On 13 July 1943, &quot;Leander&quot; was with Rear Admiral Walden Lee Ainsworth&#x27;s Task Group 36.1 of three light cruisers: &quot;Leander&quot; and the US ships and . The task group also included ten destroyers. At 01:00 the Allied ships established radar contact with the , which was accompanied by five destroyers near Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands. In the ensuing Battle of Kolombangara, &quot;Jintsu&quot; was sunk and all three Allied cruisers were hit by torpedoes and disabled. &quot;Leander&quot; was hit by a single torpedo just abaft &#x27;A&#x27; boiler room. 26 crew from the boiler room and the No.1 4-inch gun mount immediately above were killed or posted missing. The ship was so badly damaged that she took no further part in the war. She was first repaired in Auckland, then proceeded to a full refit in Boston.

She returned to the Royal Navy on 27 August 1945. In 1946 she was involved in the Corfu Channel Incident. She was scrapped in 1950.

The superyacht , owned by Sir Donald Gosling, is named after HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, the first naval vessel on which he served.

In 2020, Fiji commissioned , a patrol vessel named after Savenaca Naulumatua, a sailor from Fiji who died while serving aboard &quot;Leander&quot; during the Battle of Kolombangara.

<text>The Illinois Eastern Community Colleges is a community college district headquartered in Olney, IL, with college campuses located in Olney, Fairfield, Robinson, and Mount Carmel.

==Description==
Illinois Eastern Community Colleges District #529 (IECC) is located in a area of southeastern Illinois near the Illinois-Indiana border. The multi-college District includes Frontier Community College at Fairfield, Lincoln Trail College at Robinson, Olney Central College at Olney, and Wabash Valley College at Mt. Carmel.

Bordered on the east by the Wabash River, the District is located in a scenic section of the state, with wooded areas, golf courses, and recreational lakes scattered throughout the region. The District includes all or parts of 12 counties and has a total population of 111,000.

Because the college District is one of 39 tax-supported community college districts in the State of Illinois, the cost is very affordable. In addition, the District has purposely held the line on costs to assure that all students have equal access to higher education. (IECC&#x27;s tuition rate is one of the lowest in the tri-state area.)

A diversified base of agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, processing, and distributing provides employment for citizens throughout southeast Illinois in such industries as Automotive Technology Systems, Marathon Petroleum Refining, Champion Laboratories, Hella Electronics, North American Lighting, Wal-Mart Distribution Center, and various healthcare centers.

Each of the colleges is located in a small-town setting, with convenient access to larger cities in Illinois and Indiana. The colleges serve as centers for educational and cultural excellence, attracting not only recent high school graduates but also many adult students who are upgrading their skills, earning the first two years of a four-year degree, or participating in plays, concerts, and seminars.

The college District also includes a highly successful Workforce Education program which provides short-term training for some 10,000 employees each year at plant sites throughout the State of Illinois and in other states and countries as well.

<doc id="1150293" wikidata="Q898068" url="?curid=1150293" title="Project Pigeon">
<text>During World War II, Project Pigeon (later Project Orcon, for &quot;organic control&quot;) was American behaviorist B. F. Skinner&#x27;s attempt to develop a pigeon-controlled guided bomb.

==Overview==
The testbed was the same National Bureau of Standards-developed, unpowered airframe that was later used for the US Navy&#x27;s radar-guided &quot;Bat&quot; glide bomb, which was basically a small glider, with wings and tail surfaces, an explosive warhead section in the center, and a &quot;guidance section&quot; in the nose cone. The intent was to train pigeons to act as &quot;pilots&quot; for the device, using their cognitive abilities to recognize the target. The guidance system consisted of three lenses mounted in the nose of the vehicle, which projected an image of the target on a screen mounted in a small compartment inside the nose cone. This screen was mounted on pivots and fitted with sensors that measured any angular movement.
One to three pigeons, trained by operant conditioning to recognize the target, were stationed in front of the screen; when they saw the target, they would peck at the screen with their beaks. They were trained by being shown an image of the target and gradually more and more rapid pecks were required for a grain of food. One bird pecked more than 10,000 times in 45 minutes (Note 2/20/89 BFSkinner Foundation and author&#x27;s collection.) As long as the target remained in the center of the screen, the screen would not move, but if the bomb began to go off track, the image would move towards the edge of the screen. The pigeons would follow the image, pecking at it, which would move the screen on its pivots. In the case where two possible targets were on the screen, Skinner noted that at least two of the birds would be in agreement and the third would be &quot;punished for his minority opinion&quot; to encourage it to steer towards the target preferred by the majority of the pigeons.

The sensors would detect the movement and send signals to the control surfaces, which would steer the bomb in the direction the screen had moved. As the bomb swung back towards the target, the pigeons would again follow the image, bringing the screen back to the centered position again. In that way, the pigeons would correct any deviations in the course and keep the bomb on its glide path.

Early electronic guidance systems use similar methods, only with electronic signals and processors replacing the birds in detecting the target and preventing deviation from the glide path.

The National Defense Research Committee saw the idea to use pigeons in glide bombs as very eccentric and impractical, but still contributed $25,000 to the research. Skinner, who had some success with the training, complained: &quot;our problem was no one would take us seriously&quot;. The program was canceled on 8 October 1944, because the military believed that &quot;further prosecution of this project would seriously delay others which in the minds of the Division have more immediate promise of combat application&quot;. Project Pigeon was briefly revived by the Navy in 1948 as &quot;Project Orcon,&quot; but it was again cancelled in 1953 when the reliability of electronic guidance systems was proven.

Skinner was awarded the 2024 Ig Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the project; his daughter Julie Vargas, who received the award in his stead, is quoted as saying, &quot;I want to thank you for finally acknowledging his most important contribution. People know him only for discovering operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement, and for books like &quot;Walden Two&quot;, &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;, &quot;Beyond Freedom D&quot;, and more. Even the B.F. Skinner Foundation fails to put a missile on its hat, so thank you for finally putting the record straight.&quot;

<doc id="1150313" wikidata="Q3421539" url="?curid=1150313" title="Reaction Records">
<text>Reaction Records was an independent British record label, run by music executive Robert Stigwood in 1966 and 1967. Although Reaction released only three albums, one EP and eighteen singles in its brief existence, its roster included two of the most popular British bands of the time, The Who and Cream.

The label&#x27;s first single, The Who&#x27;s &quot;Substitute&quot;, was released several times with different B-sides due to the band&#x27;s legal dispute with their former record producer, Shel Talmy. This experience could be seen as one of the deciding factor in the Who&#x27;s manager&#x27;s Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp deciding to form their own Track Records label which was also distributed by Polydor Records.

Polydor&#x27;s involvement with these two labels (as well as Giorgio Gomelsky&#x27;s Marmalade label) can be seen as a learning process by Polydor who were interested in expanding their base and had little or no experience in the 1960s pop/rock market; at the time, most of their business was done in the easy listening genre, as exemplified by Bert Kaempfert.

Stigwood operated the RSO Records label in the 1970s and 1980s. As with Reaction, RSO was distributed through Polydor Records.

<text>The Beat Hotel was a small, run-down hotel of 42 rooms at 9 Rue Gît-le-Cœur in the Latin Quarter of Paris, notable chiefly as a residence for members of the Beat poetry movement of the mid-20th century.

==Overview==
It was a &quot;class 13&quot; hotel, meaning bottom line, a place that was required by law to meet only minimum health and safety standards. It never had any proper name – &quot;the Beat Hotel&quot; was a nickname given it by Gregory Corso, which stuck. The rooms had windows facing the interior stairwell and not much light. Hot water was available Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The hotel offered the opportunity for a bath – in the only bathtub, situated on the ground floor – provided the guest reserved time beforehand and paid the surcharge for hot water. Curtains and bedspreads were changed and washed every spring. The linen was (in principle) changed every month.

The Beat Hotel was managed by a married couple, Monsieur and Madame Rachou, from 1933. After the death of Monsieur Rachou in a traffic accident in 1957, Madame was the sole manager until the early months of 1963, when the hotel was closed. Besides letting rooms, the establishment had a small bistro on the ground floor. Due to early experiences with working at an inn frequented by Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, Madame Rachou would encourage artists and writers to stay at the hotel and even at times permit them to pay the rent with paintings or manuscripts. One unusual thing that appealed to a clientele of bohemian artists was the permission to paint and decorate the rooms rented in whichever way they wanted.

==Fame with the Beat Generation==
The hotel gained fame through the extended &quot;family&quot; of beat writers and artists who stayed there from the late 1950s to the early 1960s in a ferment of creativity.

Gregory Corso was introduced to the hotel by painter and resident Guy Harloff in 1957. In September of that year, Corso would be joined by Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. William S. Burroughs, Derek Raymond, and Harold Norse, as well as Sinclair Beiles would follow. It was here that Burroughs completed the text of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and began his lifelong collaboration with Brion Gysin. It was also where Ian Sommerville became Burroughs&#x27; &quot;systems advisor&quot; and lover. Gysin introduced Burroughs to the cut-up technique and with Sommerville they experimented with a &quot;dream machine&quot; and audio tape cut-ups. Here Norse wrote a novel &quot;Beat Hotel&quot; using cut-up techniques. Ginsberg wrote a part of his moving and mature poem &quot;Kaddish&quot; at the hotel, and Corso wrote the mushroom cloud-shaped poem &quot;Bomb&quot;.

There is now a small hotel, the four-star Relais du Vieux Paris, at that address. It displays photographs of several Beat personalities and describes itself as &quot;The Beat Hotel&quot;.

In July 2009, as part of a major William Burroughs symposium NakedLunch@50, a special tribute was held outside 9 Rue Gît-le-Coeur, with Jean-Jacques Lebel unveiling a &quot;plaque commemorative&quot;, now permanently hammered to the outside wall next to the main entrance, honoring the Beat Hotel&#x27;s seven most famous occupants: B. Gysin, H. Norse, G. Corso, A. Ginsberg, P. Orlovsky, I. Sommerville, W. Burroughs.

<text>Pearce Reginald Hartley Calvert (1928 – 21 June 1966) was an English artist manager, born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England.

He was the manager of The Fortunes, Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours, Screaming Lord Sutch, and other pop groups. In 1964, after hearing Radio Caroline, he decided to start his own pirate radio station, and made use of an old World War II fort in the Thames Estuary. Originally, the station was called Radio Sutch, and it started broadcasting on 27 May 1964, on 1542kHz. They had a summer of fun, but when Sutch decided to return to performing, Reg Calvert carried on, renamed it Radio City, and put it onto a more professional footing.

Calvert was shot and killed by Oliver Smedley, the former owner of a rival offshore station, Radio Atlanta, who was later acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence.

==Life and career==
Calvert was born into a family of musicians in Huddersfield, and was conscripted into the army in 1946, after being demobbed he moved to Southampton where he attempted various means of making a living, including making popcorn, compering ballroom dances and playing piano in a club.

===Music manager===
In 1956 Calvert heard Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, he then determined that his ambition was to bring rock and roll music to Britain. Calvert then embarked on a career as a music manager, and set about assembling a stable of young musicians, who would tour the country and play the hits of the day, while imitating the looks and style of the popular stars of the time.

In 1961, Calvert bought Clifton Hall, a former stately home near Rugby, Warwickshire as a base for his operations, where he assembled, created and managed an array of bands. These included Danny Storm, Buddy Britten, The Fortunes, Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours, and Robbie Hood And His Merrie Men. Of these, The Fortunes and Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours went on to have mainstream commercial success. In 1962, Clifton Hall was featured in a short film made by British Pathé.

Calvert also managed the musical career of Screaming Lord Sutch; it was Calvert who suggested that Sutch stand as a candidate at the 1963 Stratford-upon-Avon by-election as a publicity stunt, therefore launching Sutch&#x27;s career as a political candidate.

===Pirate radio ===
Calvert established the pirate station Radio City, which broadcast from a Second World War marine fort off the Kent coast, seven miles from Margate. Radio Atlanta, the second pirate radio station, ran out of money and merged with Radio Caroline, which had also run out of money. It was decided that Calvert would be asked to amalgamate with them and they would pay the bills, giving Calvert 50% of the profit. After a couple of months, Radio Atlanta was again in financial difficulty and not paying bills or wages, so Calvert resumed control. Later in 1965, Major Oliver Smedley and Allan Crawford approached him again to go into partnership, on the proviso that they would provide a new transmitter. In December 1965, the transmitter arrived from Texas. It was old and very large, and the wrong sort of transmitter. The power pack fell in the sea as they tried to hoist it onto the station, and although it was dried out, the transmitter used too much power and was unsuitable. Neither Radio City nor Atlanta engineers could get it to work properly. Shortly afterwards, Atlanta sent Radio City a bill of £600 for the transport from Texas. Calvert returned it to Atlanta, on the grounds that the transmitter was its responsibility and could be collected at any time.

Smedley approached Calvert again, saying he had someone interested in buying the station, and came to the office with a Mr Fablon to go through the accounts. By May 1965, Radio City was one of the few very profitable stations. Nothing further was heard from Fablon, but unknown to Calvert, Smedley had put together a company and, as chairman, was trying to sell shares in Radio City without Calvert&#x27;s knowledge.

In June 1966, Calvert agreed to go into partnership with another pirate station, Radio London. When Smedley telephoned Calvert to tell him he again had some buyers interested, Calvert explained he was entering into a partnership with Radio London instead. Smedley shouted abuse down the telephone and decided to take over Radio City with a boarding party in the middle of the night. Allan Crawford from Radio Atlanta refused to join in the boarding party. He tried to persuade Smedley not to go ahead with his plan, and told him not to use the name of Atlanta.

Smedley&#x27;s response was to hire a group of riggers, who boarded Radio City on 20 June and put the station&#x27;s transmitter out of action. First Smedley contacted Phillip Birch from Radio London and demanded £5,000 and half the profits to take his men off. Birch accused him of blackmail and refused to pay. Next, Smedley demanded the same of Calvert, who also refused. News from Radio City was that the boarders were armed and would destroy all the equipment if Calvert or anyone else tried to evict them. Calvert went to the police to ask for their support, but they refused as it was outside their legal jurisdiction. They suggested he should sort it out with Smedley. Calvert tried repeatedly to do so but Smedley was never available – he was trying to sell the station to Radio 390.

==Homicide==
On 21 June, Calvert visited Smedley&#x27;s home at Wendens Ambo, Essex, to request the removal of the raiders and the return of vital transmitter parts. Calvert was shot dead by Smedley in what has been described as a &quot;violent row&quot;. Smedley said he did it to protect his housekeeper and at the subsequent trial, it was alleged that there was a violent struggle. Smedley claimed that he feared Calvert was there to kill him and he was acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence.

Calvert was buried on 1 July 1966 at St Peter&#x27;s, Dunchurch. Screaming Lord Sutch and members of the group Pinkerton&#x27;s Assorted Colours were among the mourners at the funeral.

==Critical response==
Partly in response to the sensational death of Calvert, and lurid tales of piracy, the British government passed the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967, which made offshore broadcasting a criminal offence as of 15 August 1967. Radio City stopped broadcasting after Calvert&#x27;s wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1946, appeared in court charged under the older Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, because the station was sited within the limit. Radio City closed down shortly after Dorothy Calvert lost the case.

==Personal life==
His wife Dorothy Rowe Calvert died on 21 February 2010. Her funeral and interment, also at St Peter&#x27;s, Dunchurch, took place on 5 March 2010.

<doc id="1150323" wikidata="Q1038922" url="?curid=1150323" title="The Wake of Magellan">
<text>The Wake of Magellan is the tenth studio album released by the American heavy metal band Savatage. The album was released in September 1997 in Europe and Japan, and in April 1998 in the US.

This is the first Savatage album to have the same lineup as the previous album since &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; in 1987 and also the last to feature vocals from lead singer Zachary Stevens. The progressive metal band Dream Theater are thanked in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Dream Theater keyboard player Derek Sherinian and Al Pitrelli went to college together, were both in the band Ethyl Mertz and toured with Alice Cooper for the &quot;Trashes the World&quot; tour. Pitrelli and John Petrucci also played together on a Japanese release called &quot;Guitar Battle&quot;.

==Story==

&quot;The Wake of Magellan&quot; is a concept album based on two real life events. The first, the Maersk Dubai incident, occurred just over a year before the album was released, when the captain and officers of the ship threw three Romanian stowaways overboard in the middle of the Atlantic. A fourth stowaway was saved by the courageous actions of the ship&#x27;s boatswain, Rodolfo Miguel, who risked his own life to protect the youth after witnessing the other three murders. The second event regarded the Irish reporter Veronica Guerin, who died fighting the growth of the drug trade in her country. Her death may accomplish what she could not in life. These events are combined into the story of an old Portuguese sailor, Fernão de Magalhães (Ferdinand Magellan in English), who has decided to end his life by sailing his small boat out into the Atlantic until it sinks. In his mind he has romanticized this decision as a glorious, Vikingesque way to die. When the ocean winds push him into a great storm, and he believes that his wish is about to be granted in a great dramatic fashion, he suddenly sees a man drowning in the ocean. In an instant he finds himself taking back every wish for death&#x27;s embrace, and fights to save this soul. After many twists and turns, he is able to save the stowaway that had been thrown overboard. Returning to land, he now realizes that not only every life is precious but also every hour of that life.

==Reception==

Matthias Breusch of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; praised the album for being &quot;a super-melodic, varied, one hundred percent song-oriented concentrate opus, precisely made without visible weld seam&quot;, which conquered his heart after repeated listenings. He lauded Savatage for &quot;consistently carry through their unmistakable style and yet constantly change&quot;. Metal Rules reviewer was happy to find Jon Oliva still active as lead vocalist in two songs, but considered Zak Stevens&#x27; performance that of &quot;a vocal genius&quot;. AllMusic Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s review lingered on the ambitious narrative by Paul O&#x27;Neill and remarked how &quot;Savatage&#x27;s surprisingly graceful music not only does fit the story line, but it has sweeping melodies, intricate arrangements and stunning solos that are compelling on their own terms&quot;, showing how &quot;the group continued to improve in the &#x27;90s&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff found &quot;The Wake of Magellan&quot; &quot;quite thick plot-wise&quot;, but appreciated how the album got &quot;right to the metal, a decidedly raw and basic metal oddly enough&quot;, despite the band remaining &quot;king of piano-to-riff dynamic&quot;, more in the way of Kansas than of Queen, which Savatage had been compared to.

<doc id="1150325" wikidata="Q7063571" url="?curid=1150325" title="Notting Hill Gate">
<text>Notting Hill Gate is one of the main thoroughfares in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Historically the street was a location for toll gates, from which it derives its modern name.

== Location ==

At Ossington Street/Kensington Palace Gardens, the Bayswater Road becomes Notting Hill Gate, continuing westward until it becomes Holland Park Avenue, just before it reaches Ladbroke Grove.

Notting Hill Gate is distinct from Notting Hill, although the two are often confused, with &quot;Notting Hill&quot; being used as an abbreviation of &quot;Notting Hill Gate&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill Gate&quot; suggesting to outsiders that it is the full description of Notting Hill. In fact, however, the street named Notting Hill Gate is well to the south of the hill (with its summit at the junction of Ladbroke Grove and Kensington Park Gardens) which gives its name to the area known (long before the establishment of the Notting Hill toll gate) as Notting Hill.

== Character ==

Notting Hill Gate is home to a variety of stores, restaurants, cafés and estate agents as well as more specialist stores which include rare records and antiques, as well as two historic cinemas, the Coronet (originally opened as a theatre in 1898) and the Gate, as well as also several bars and clubs.

== 1950s redevelopment ==

Much of the street was redeveloped in the 1950s with two large tower blocks being erected on the north and south sides of the street. At this time Notting Hill Gate tube station was also redeveloped linking two stations on the Circle and District and Central lines which had previously been accessed on either side of the street with an entirely underground station enabling interchange between the deep level Central Line and the sub-surface Circle and District Lines. The new tube station also acts as a pedestrian subway under the widened Notting Hill Gate, the subway leading to the ticket office, a toilet (now closed) and a newsagent (now closed).

Not all of Notting Hill Gate&#x27;s original features were lost when it was redeveloped however, one good example of this being the Notting Hill Coronet. Previously a theatre, it was converted into a cinema in 1923, and was saved from demolition by local activists in 1972 and 1989. In 2004, its long-term future was secured by the Kensington Temple who acquired the site with the intention of continuing to provide independent cinema. The Coronet is one of two famous cinemas on Notting Hill Gate, the other being the Gate which opened in 1911 and still retains its Edwardian plasterwork, including a heavily coffered ceiling.

== Transport links ==

===London Underground===
Notting Hill Gate is the site of Notting Hill Gate tube station served by the Central, Circle &amp; District lines.

===London Buses===
It is also on the route of the 27, 28, 31, 52, 70, 94, 148, 328, 390, 452, N28, N31, N52 and N207 buses. There are several bus stops along both sides of Notting Hill Gate. 
===Oxford Tube coach service===
It is also on the route of the 24-hour Oxford Tube (coach) service.
== Environs ==

To the south of Notting Hill Gate lies Kensington Church Street, with its restaurants and antique shops, Hillgate Village (a name given to the area immediately south of Notting Hill Gate with its multi-coloured houses) and Campden Hill Road. North from the tube station lies Pembridge Road, which leads to Westbourne Grove. This area is often packed with tourists heading to the nearby Portobello Road market, or to spot locations from the film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;.

The Notting Hill Gate Improvement Group aims to improve the environment of Notting Hill Gate and neighbouring streets, working in partnership with the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Land Securities and Delancey plc, which own many of the 1950s buildings. However, the London Evening Standard reported on 17 May 2010 that Land Securities and Delancey have put their Notting Hill Gate estate up for sale, with an asking price of £130 million. The freehold estate includes about two-thirds of Notting Hill Gate and part of Kensington Church Street. Land Securities, which has owned it since the &#x27;50s, in partnership with Delancey Estates since 2004, decided to sell after plans to brighten up the area foundered in 2005 in the face of local and council opposition.

<doc id="1150329" wikidata="Q682772" url="?curid=1150329" title="Pigpen cipher">
<text>The pigpen cipher (alternatively referred to as the masonic cipher, Freemason&#x27;s cipher, Rosicrucian cipher, Napoleon cipher, and tic-tac-toe cipher) is a geometric simple substitution cipher, which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid. The example key shows one way the letters can be assigned to the grid.

==Insecurity==
The Pigpen cipher offers little cryptographic security. It differentiates itself from other simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers solely by its use of symbols rather than letters, the use of which fails to assist in curbing cryptanalysis. Additionally, the prominence and recognizability of the Pigpen leads to it being arguably worthless from a security standpoint. Knowledge of Pigpen is so ubiquitous that an interceptor might not need to actually &quot;break&quot; this cipher at all, but merely &quot;decipher&quot; it, in the same way that the intended recipient would.

Due to Pigpen&#x27;s simplicity, it is very often included in children&#x27;s books on ciphers and secret writing.

==History==
The cipher is believed to be an ancient cipher and is said to have originated with the Hebrew rabbis. Thompson writes that, “there is evidence that suggests that the Knights Templar utilized a pig-pen cipher” during the Christian Crusades.

Parrangan &amp; Parrangan write that it was used by an individual, who may have been a Mason, “in the 16th century to save his personal notes.”

In 1531 Cornelius Agrippa described an early form of the Rosicrucian cipher, which he attributes to an existing Jewish Kabbalistic tradition. This system, called &quot;The Kabbalah of the Nine Chambers&quot; by later authors, used the Hebrew alphabet rather than the Latin alphabet, and was used for religious symbolism rather than for any apparent cryptological purpose.

On the 7th July 1730, a French Pirate named Olivier Levasseur threw out a scrap of paper written in the pigpen cipher, allegedly containing the whereabouts of his treasure which was never found but is speculated to be located in Seychelles. The exact configuration of the cipher has also not been determined, an example of using different letters in different sections to further complicate the cipher from its standard configuration.

Variations of this cipher were used by both the Rosicrucian brotherhood and the Freemasons, though the latter used the pigpen cipher so often that the system is frequently called the Freemason&#x27;s cipher. Hysin claims it was invented by Freemasons. They began using it in the early 18th century to keep their records of history and rites private, and for correspondence between lodge leaders. Tombstones of Freemasons can also be found which use the system as part of the engravings. One of the earliest stones in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City, which opened in 1697, contains a cipher of this type which deciphers to &quot;Remember death&quot; (cf. &quot;memento mori&quot;).

George Washington&#x27;s army had documentation about the system, with a much more randomized form of the alphabet. During the American Civil War, the system was used by Union prisoners in Confederate prisons.

==Example==
Using the Pigpen cipher key shown in the example below, the message &quot;codice_1&quot; is rendered in ciphertext as
==Variants==
The core elements of this system are the grid and dots. Some systems use the X&#x27;s, but even these can be rearranged. One commonly used method orders the symbols as shown in the above image: grid, grid, X, X. Another commonly used system orders the symbols as grid, X, grid, X. Another is grid, grid, grid, with each cell having a letter of the alphabet, and the last one having an &quot;&amp;&quot; character. Letters from the first grid have no dot, letters from the second each have one dot, and letters from the third each have two dots. Another variation of this last one is called the Newark Cipher, which instead of dots uses one to three short lines which may be projecting in any length or orientation. This gives the illusion of a larger number of different characters than actually exist.

Another system, used by the Rosicrucians in the 17th century, used a single grid of nine cells, and 1 to 3 dots in each cell or &quot;pen&quot;. So ABC would be in the top left pen, followed by DEF and GHI on the first line, then groups of JKL MNO PQR on the second, and STU VWX YZ on the third. When enciphered, the location of the dot in each symbol (left, center, or right), would indicate which letter in that pen was represented. More difficult systems use a non-standard form of the alphabet, such as writing it backwards in the grid, up and down in the columns, or a completely randomized set of letters.

The Templar cipher is a method claimed to have been used by the Knights Templar and uses a variant of a Maltese Cross. This is likely a cipher used by the Neo-Templars (Freemasons) of the 18th century, and not that of the religious order of the Knights Templar from the 12th-14th centuries during the Crusades. Some websites showing the Knights Templar cipher deviate from the original order of letters. Based on the Freemasons Document, the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th crosses assign the letters in clock-wise order starting at the top, the 2nd cross assigns the letters in a left, right, top, bottom order while the final cross assigns the letters in a bottom, top, right left order.

=== Club Penguin Code ===
The Club Penguin Code, also known as the Tic-Tac-Toe code, the PSA cipher, and the EPF cipher, is a cipher created by online composer and artist Chris Hendricks (known online as Screenhog) for the online game Club Penguin. Designed for use by the in-universe group Elite Penguin Force, (EPF, formerly known as Penguin Secret Agency, or PSA) the cipher leans more heavily into the style of Tic-Tac-Toe. It is represented with three grids, which each represent nine letters of the alphabet arranged left to right, top to bottom; one blank, for letters A-I, one with the letter X in each space, for letters J-R, and one with the letter O in each space, for letters S-Z, plus an additional character. This last character is used as a signature for the in-universe leader of the EPF, known as the Director.

The need for a unique code came from Hendricks wishing to distance Club Penguin related materials from anything regarding Freemason or New World Order conspiracy theories. He said in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel:I just didn&#x27;t want Club Penguin being associated in videos like &quot;So, Club Penguin, right? &#x27;Fun and safe virtual world for kids?&#x27; I guess they forgot to put mind control in their advertisements! I have hard-hitting exclusive proof that Club Penguin is using the exact same code that the Illuminati use!&quot; [...] Now, I grant you, the odds of a video like that actually gaining any traction is pretty slim, but would you take that chance? I didn&#x27;t. I instead looked at the code and said &quot;This looks a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe! What if we just copied it three times, kept the first one blank, the second one with X&#x27;s, and the third one with O&#x27;s? That&#x27;s twenty-seven spaces. It&#x27;ll cover the whole alphabet and give us something unique that&#x27;s not conspiracy theory friendly.&quot; So that&#x27;s what we did, and that was that.

<text>Aodogán Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly (21 May 1940 – 20 April 2020) was an Irish businessman best known for the creation of the offshore radio station, Radio Caroline. He also became manager of George Lazenby, who played James Bond in one film.

==Biography==
===Background===
O&#x27;Rahilly was born in Dublin, the third of five children. His parents owned the private port at Greenore, County Louth, on Carlingford Lough. His grandfather Michael O&#x27;Rahilly (The O&#x27;Rahilly) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of Ireland, a leader in the Easter Rising, who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916.

O&#x27;Rahilly described himself as a rebel who had been expelled from school seven times. He started living in London at the age of 17.

===London club scene===
Before he founded Radio Caroline, O&#x27;Rahilly started training in method acting in London, frequented nightclubs and became acquainted with such entertainment industry figures as Giorgio Gomelsky and Simon Dee. He then ran a night club, the Scene, off Great Windmill Street in Soho, London, where in 1963 the Rolling Stones played, amongst others including Zoot Money and Chris Farlowe. He became the manager of musicians, such as Alexis Korner and Georgie Fame, and helped to persuade the Animals to move to London. Alan Price said of O&#x27;Rahilly: &quot;Ronan knew how things were done; he was very hip, he really fancied himself, but he had a lot of &#x27;get up and go&#x27; and verve. He helped to launch the Animals&quot;.

He tried to persuade radio stations to play a promotional acetate record by Georgie Fame, a practice that was almost unheard of at the time. He took the record to the BBC to try to get it played, and discovered that the record industry was dominated by EMI and Decca. He then tried to get it played on Radio Luxembourg and again found that the shows were &quot;owned&quot; by major labels EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips. They were essentially &quot;payola&quot; shows, featuring only music from labels willing and able to pay for them to be played.

===Radio Caroline===

He then set about creating the pirate radio station Radio Caroline, which began broadcasting in 1964 from a ship, the MV &quot;Caroline,&quot; anchored in international waters off the coast of Essex, eastern England. The idea for the station was based partly on a plan by Australian music publisher Allan Crawford (who had spent almost two years planning the launch of Radio Atlanta) and also on Radio Veronica, which had been broadcasting off the Netherlands since 1960. Radio Caroline was largely funded by financier John Sheffield (great uncle of Samantha Cameron) and Carl Ross (creator of the Ross fishery frozen food business and grandfather of David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse) and publisher Jocelyn Stevens. In 1965, the Caroline and Atlanta companies merged under the Radio Caroline name, their two ships giving greater coverage of the United Kingdom.

Broadcasts ceased in 1968, the ships&#x27; operations having been hampered by UK legislation in the previous year, which also saw new competition from the BBC&#x27;s Radio 1. O&#x27;Rahilly was involved in the reappearance of Radio Caroline in several forms during the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Other initiatives ===
In 1966, O&#x27;Rahilly gave businessman Phil Solomon a share in Radio Caroline, and with him set up Major Minor Records, whose acts including The Dubliners and David McWilliams were then promoted by the station. O&#x27;Rahilly also attempted, but failed, to set up a Caroline TV station.

In 1968, he became involved in the production of a number of films, including as executive producer on the Marianne Faithfull film &quot;The Girl on a Motorcycle&quot; and on &quot;Two Virgins&quot; featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

O&#x27;Rahilly became manager of the Australian model-turned-actor George Lazenby, who played James Bond in one film. During production of the 1969 James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, O&#x27;Rahilly talked Lazenby into refusing a seven-film Bond contract on grounds that the James Bond character was out of touch with the times, and would not successfully continue into the 1970s. Of this advice, Roger Moore wrote in his autobiography, &quot;My Word Is My Bond&quot;, &quot;George took some bad advice [...], and that he himself would never last beyond one more film in the role. He decided to get out while his fame was riding high and refused to sign the seven-picture contract Cubby and Harry waved under his nose. I knew George then and have met him many times since. He admits he made a mistake&quot;. O&#x27;Rahilly also appeared in Lazenby&#x27;s film &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; where both men were credited as executive producers.

O&#x27;Rahilly briefly managed the American rock band The MC5 in the early 1970s. Later in the decade, claiming that people &quot;found it easier to talk about hate than love&quot;, and influenced by spiritual leader Ram Dass, he developed the philosophy of &quot;Loving Awareness&quot;, which was then heavily promoted on Caroline. In 1976 an album of songs based on the concept was recorded by the Loving Awareness Band, a group assembled by O&#x27;Rahilly for the purpose. Several members of the band went on to form the Blockheads.

===Later life===

In December 2007, O&#x27;Rahilly was inducted as a Fellow of the Radio Academy. O&#x27;Rahilly was inducted into the Hall Of Fame at the PPI Radio Awards, held at the Lyrath Hotel, Kilkenny, Ireland, on 12 October 2012.

In 2012, O&#x27;Rahilly was diagnosed with vascular dementia and returned to live in County Louth, Ireland, in sight of the port of Greenore where Radio Caroline was &quot;born&quot; in the 1960s. He lived in a nursing home at Carlingford. He died on 20 April 2020, at the age of 79.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Rahilly married Catherine Hamilton-Davies in 1993. After his dementia diagnosis, he lived in County Louth with Inês Rocha Trindade.

<doc id="1150333" wikidata="Q7269283" url="?curid=1150333" title="Quarterback sneak">
<text>A quarterback sneak is a play in gridiron football in which the quarterback, upon taking the center snap, runs forward or dives ahead while the offensive line is also surging forward. Despite the &quot;sneak&quot; moniker, this version of a quarterback draw play is often expected in situations where a very short gain is needed.

The play is often desired in short-yardage situations in the National Football League (NFL), since there are no further ball exchanges beyond the center snap. The quarterback receives the ball near the line of scrimmage and immediately moves forward, giving the defense little time to react and making it less likely that significant yardage will be lost on the play. Although the play rarely gains more than one or two yards, it can often result in a significant gain. One notable exception was Greg Landry gaining 76 yards in 1970 on a quarterback sneak against Green Bay, which set an NFL record at the time for the longest rush by a quarterback. The origins of the sneak play date back to 1912, where standout Yale quarterback Graham Winkelbaum first used it in a game against rival Harvard.

Quarterback sneaks are statistically the most likely plays to convert short yardage situations, though each situation varies. Many football statistics sites advocate for increased usage of the play.

QB sneaks have drawbacks in that they tend to expose the quarterback to hits from opposing defenders. Often quarterbacks do not wish to expose themselves to the increased risk of injury associated with the play. This is especially prevalent with traditional pocket passing quarterbacks, such as Drew Brees or Tom Brady, although Brady was very effective at running the play. One of the most famous sneaks in football history was executed by Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr against the Dallas Cowboys in the famous &quot;Ice Bowl&quot; NFL championship game played on December 31, 1967.

== Brotherly Shove==
Since 2022, the Philadelphia Eagles have run a highly-successful version of the quarterback sneak involving two players that push quarterback Jalen Hurts forward across the line of scrimmage. The pushing from behind has often been compared to several different rugby forms of gameplay, such as the scrum, driving maul, and pick-and-go. During the 2022 season, the Eagles successfully converted 29 of 32 attempts for a first down – a success rate of over 90%. The controversial play became widely known as the &quot;Tush Push&quot;, as well as the &quot;Brotherly Shove&quot;, which is a play on the &quot;City of Brotherly Love&quot; nickname for Philadelphia.

Between 2022 to 2024, the Eagles and the Buffalo Bills executed the play 163 times. Both teams either scored a touchdown or achieved a first down 87% of the time, while the rest of the NFL has only been successful on 71% of attempts. Hurts and the Eagles scored the first touchdown of Super Bowl LIX using the play. Other NFL teams, as well as college football teams, have also adapted some form of the Tush Push.

Some NFL teams have lobbied to ban the tush push outright, citing safety concerns and the &quot;assisting the runner&quot; penalty. The tactic takes advantage of an NFL rule that was modified in 2005 to allow players to assist the ball carrier in the form of pushing, which was previously banned, although &quot;pulling&quot; and &quot;carrying&quot; are still prohibited. In 2022, NFL&#x27;s officiating department issued a clarification regarding whether the play should be penalized: &quot;This is not a foul, because what he is doing is pushing the runner. Players are allowed to push, but they are not allowed to encircle and pull to assist the runner.&quot; In 2023, NFL investigated the potential injury risk of the play and concluded &quot;nothing notable&quot; was found, although NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated there were other aspects about the play to consider. In February 2025, the Green Bay Packers submitted a proposal to the NFL’s competition committee to ban &quot;Tush Push&quot; and the play will be a topic of discussion at the Annual League Meeting in March. 

Despite his team&#x27;s usage of the legal tactic, Bills&#x27; head coach Sean McDermott stated in February 2025 that it is &quot;potentially contrary to the health and safety of the players&quot;. Jason Kelce, an Eagles center who retired after the 2023 season, acknowledged it is a &quot;grueling play&quot; but added that football is &quot;a sport that comes down to physicality&quot;. Other teams have opposed banning, as some have begun experimenting with the play themselves.

<text>William Oliver Smedley (19 February 1911 – 16 November 1989) was an English businessman involved in classical liberal politics and pirate radio. In 1966, he killed Reginald Calvert, in what was judged to be an act of self-defence.

== Early life and World War II ==
Smedley was born in Godstone, Surrey, on 19 February 1911, the son of William Herbert and Olivia Kate Smedley. His father was a director of the Gramophone Company. He attended Monkton Combe School near Bath, Somerset. Smedley enlisted on 17 April 1939 in the Royal Artillery and was commissioned in April 1940. He served in Iraq, North Africa, Sicily, and Italy before D-Day. He also became a paratrooper and participated in Operation Market Garden. Smedley won the Military Cross in December 1944 for his actions on 11 July 1944 at Audrieu in the battle for Normandy.
== Political career ==
Smedley described himself as an &quot;uncompromising free-trader and libertarian&quot;. In opposition to Clement Attlee&#x27;s Agriculture Act 1947, Smedley helped to found, and become secretary of, the Farmers&#x27; and Smallholders&#x27; Association in 1947. Its first president was the Conservative Party MP Waldron Smithers. In 1952, Smedley resigned from his job as a chartered accountant and campaigned for economic liberalism from his office in EC2. S. W. Alexander, editor of the &quot;City Press&quot;, used the newspaper to publicise Smedley&#x27;s campaigns. Smedley later described himself and Alexander as &quot;the only active free-traders left in England in the 1950s&quot;.

Smedley&#x27;s main campaigning organisation was the Cheap Food League, which was against all types of protection and subsidy in agriculture, especially marketing boards. During a potato shortage in 1955, he said: &quot;The NFU statement confirms my view that the union leaders care not whether the people starve, provided the potato growers are permanently protected from the cold wind of overseas competition. Such callous irresponsibility has been unknown in the land since the days of the Corn Laws.&quot;

In a protest against high taxation, Smedley founded the Council for the Reduction of Taxation in 1954. In 1955, whilst a member of the Society of Individualists, Smedley met Antony Fisher and together, following Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s advice, they founded a new research institute to propagate neoliberal ideas. On Smedley&#x27;s suggestion, it was named the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Fisher and Ralph Harris (director of the IEA) were concerned with Smedley&#x27;s links with the Liberal Party, and Harris moved the IEA&#x27;s office from Smedley&#x27;s EC2 office to Hobart Place in 1959.

Smedley took over the Free Trade League and the Cobden Club in 1958. As a Liberal Party politician, he stook against Rab Butler in Saffron Walden in the general elections of 1950 and 1951. In all, he contested eighteen parliamentary elections. According to Richard Cockett, Smedley and Alfred Suenson-Taylor &quot;sought to keep the flames of Gladstonian Liberalism burning within the [Liberal] Party&quot; and to oppose the influence of William Beveridge and John Maynard Keynes. Smedley was a critic of what he considered to be the Liberal Party&#x27;s abandonment of free trade and self-improvement.

Smedley left the Liberal Party in 1962 due to his opposition to their favourable attitude to British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). He founded the Keep Britain Out campaign to oppose British membership of the EEC. &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that Smedley &quot;believed that the EEC undermined the sovereignty of Britain and he was relentless in his efforts to save Britain from the high food prices of the protectionist common agricultural policies&quot;. In 1982, he founded the Free Trade Liberal Party with Alexander.

== Pirate radio ==
In 1964, with Alan Crawford, Smedley helped to form the British company Project Atlanta Limited that successfully launched Radio Atlanta, Britain&#x27;s second full-time offshore commercial pirate radio station. The station used a ship that had once been the home of Radio Nord. Radio Atlanta eventually merged with the Caroline Organization led by Irishman Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, and changed its name to Radio Caroline South. When Reginald Calvert, manager of The Fortunes pop group, founded a rival pirate station Radio City, Smedley tried to persuade Calvert to amalgamate with Radio Caroline in exchange for a new transmitter. The transmitter turned out to be antiquated and did not work properly (one of its sections had been accidentally dropped into the sea prior to being installed, although it is uncertain as to whether this was responsible for its malfunctioning) and Calvert refused to pay for it. Smedley in response hired a group of riggers to board Radio City and retrieve the transmitter.

The next day (21 June 1966), Smedley received threatening phone calls from Calvert and that night Calvert went to Smedley&#x27;s house at Wendens Ambo, Essex. Smedley killed Calvert with a shotgun in what has been described as a &quot;violent row&quot;. At his trial, Smedley said he feared Calvert was there to kill him. On 18 October 1966, the jury found Smedley not guilty of manslaughter in under a minute on the grounds of self-defence, and awarded him 250 guineas in costs.

<text>Vivo Software was a pioneer internet streaming media company which was acquired by RealNetworks in March 1998. Vivo Software designed the &quot;Vivo Video/Audio platform&quot;, including its encoding tools and end-user &quot;VivoActive Player&quot;.

The Vivo format, obsolete today, was one of the first to be designed and used for internet streaming. The Vivo platform was a well-known player when streaming media was in its infancy and was deployed mainly on erotic sites during the mid-1990s. Since then RealPlayer, QuickTime and Windows Media have evolved as the dominant platforms. The development of Vivo ceased in 1997 to be replaced by RealPlayer from RealNetworks.

==VivoActive==

VivoActive is an audio/video format created by Vivo Software, acquired by RealNetworks in 1997. The Vivo format is based upon H.263 video and G.723 ADPCM audio (not the G.723.1 speech codec). It uses inter-frame coding, but does not insert any key frames, except at the beginning of the clip, which effectively disables the possibility of seeking to specific locations in the stream. One of the last released versions of VivoActive Player added a workaround for this handicap by quickly decoding all frames from the first one to the requested position.

MPlayer is able to play and convert Vivo video clips.

==Playback==
The official client (The VivoActive Player) was limited. Current available clients are:

*Mplayer – http://www.mplayerhq.hu
*RealPlayer – http://www.real.com
*VivoActive Browser Plug-in –

<text>Gee Records was a New York–based American record label formed as a subsidiary to Gloria Gee George Goldner&#x27;s Tico Records and Rama Records labels in 1953 to honor the million selling hit song &quot;Gee&quot; (1953). Sometime in 1955 Goldner (an inveterate gambler) sold 50% of Gee to Joe Kolsky who was a business partner of Morris Levy. Kolsky and Goldner then opened another label Roulette Records in 1957 with Levy as president. A few months later, Goldner sold his shares of Roulette, Rama, Gee, and Tico to the Morris Levy Combine. Goldner then proceeded that year to open two new companies Gone Records and End Records. Gee Records eventually became deactivated. When Gee Records was reactivated as a division of Roulette Records by president Morris Levy in early April 1961, The Cleftones&#x27; hit &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (1961) became Gee Records first release.
