<text>Robert Rutherford &quot;Colonel&quot; McCormick (July 30, 1880 – April 1, 1955) was an American publisher, lawyer, and businessman.

A member of the McCormick family of Chicago, McCormick became a lawyer, Republican Chicago alderman, distinguished U.S. Army officer in World War I, and eventually owner and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper. A leading Republican, McCormick opposed the New Deal and later opposed American entry into World War II. His legacy includes what is now the McCormick Foundation philanthropic organization.

==Early life and international education==

McCormick was born July 30, 1880, in Chicago to Robert Sanderson McCormick (1849–1919) and his wife, Katherine Van Etta Medill McCormick (1853–1932). Family members quickly nicknamed him &quot;Bertie&quot; because so many relatives shared the name, including his late paternal great-grandfather Robert McCormick. His maternal grandfather was &quot;Tribune&quot; editor and former Chicago mayor Joseph Medill, on whose estate McCormick would live for much of his adult life. 

On his father&#x27;s side, his great-uncle was inventor and businessman Cyrus McCormick. His elder brother Joseph Medill McCormick (known as &quot;Medill McCormick&quot;) was slated to take over the family newspaper business, but was more interested in running for political office, and became a member of the United States House of Representatives (1917–1919) and then the U.S. Senate before losing his bid for a second term and ending his life by suicide in Washington, D.C. in 1925. Meanwhile, from 1889 through 1893, Bertie lived a lonely childhood with his parents in London. His father Robert Sanderson McCormick was Second Secretary of the American Legation in London, serving from 1889 to 1892 under Robert Todd Lincoln. Later, his father served as his nation&#x27;s ambassador to Austria-Hungary (1901–1902) and Imperial Russia (1902–1905), and replaced Horace Porter as ambassador to France in 1905.

While in London, Bertie attended Ludgrove School. Sent back to the United States, Bertie attended Groton School, as had his brother. In 1899, the year of his maternal grandfather Joseph Medill&#x27;s death, McCormick matriculated at Yale College, where he was elected to the prestigious secret society Scroll and Key and graduated in 1903 (three years after his brother). Robert McCormick then attended the Northwestern University School of Law and after graduation became a clerk in a Chicago law firm.

==Career==
Robert McCormick was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1907. The following year, he co-founded the law firm that became Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which represented the Tribune Company. However, his elder brother, Medill McCormick, had become depressed after taking over and expanding the family newspaper business, so, in 1908, on the advice of psychoanalyst Carl Jung, Medill gave up that job, and Robert became increasingly involved in the family publishing business. Despite that business involvement, a scandal that ultimately led to his marriage (see below), and his military service (which led to him becoming known as &quot;the Colonel&quot;), McCormick continued as a law firm partner until 1920.

In 1910, Robert McCormick took control of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and, in 1914, became editor and publisher with his cousin, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson, who was the son of a &quot;Tribune&quot; editor who had wed Joseph Medill&#x27;s daughter. In 1919, Patterson, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois, moved to New York City and founded the tabloid &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. However he and McCormick, while often disagreeing, jointly held both positions at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; until 1926, when McCormick assumed both roles at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and Patterson concentrated on the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

In 1904, a Republican ward leader persuaded McCormick to run for alderman. Elected, he served two years on the Chicago City Council. In 1905, at the age of 25, he was elected to a five-year term as president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Sanitary District, which operated the city&#x27;s vast drainage and sewage disposal system. In 1907 McCormick was appointed to the Chicago Permanent Charter Commission and the Chicago Plan Commission. However, his political career ended abruptly when he took control of the &quot;Tribune.&quot;

McCormick went to Europe as a war correspondent for the &quot;Tribune&quot; in February 1915, early in World War I. He interviewed Tsar Nicholas, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill. McCormick also visited (and was under fire on) both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Using connections his father had made while ambassador to Russia, McCormick attended formal dinners with Grand Duke Nicholas and Grand Duke Peter. During this trip, McCormick collected fragments of the cathedral at Ypres and the city hall of Arras. Reputedly, these pieces were the first of the collection of stones that were later embedded in the facade of the Tribune Tower. However, they are not actually on display.

===Military service===
Returning to the United States in early 1915, McCormick joined the Illinois National Guard on June 21, 1916. His family background, education and expert horsemanship led to his being commissioned as a major in its 1st Cavalry Regiment. Two days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had called the Illinois National Guard into federal service, along with those of several other states, to patrol the Mexican border during General John Joseph Pershing&#x27;s Punitive Expedition. McCormick accompanied his regiment to the Mexican border. Soon after, the United States entered the war, the entire Illinois National Guard was mobilized for federal service in Europe. McCormick thus became part of the U.S. Army on June 13, 1917, and was sent to France as an intelligence officer on the staff of General Pershing. Seeking more active service, he was assigned to an artillery school.

By June 17, 1918, McCormick became a lieutenant colonel, and by September 5, 1918, was promoted to a full colonel in the field artillery. He took part in the capture of Cantigny (hence his later naming his farm estate near Wheaton, Illinois), and in the battles of Soissons, Saint-Mihiel, and the second phase of the Argonne. McCormick served in the 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, with the 1st Infantry Division. His service ended on December 31, 1918, though he remained a part of the Officers Reserve Corps from October 8, 1919, to September 30, 1929. Cited for prompt action in battle, he received the Distinguished Service Medal, and was later always referred to as &quot;Colonel McCormick&quot;. 

===Crusading publisher===
McCormick returned from the war and took control of the &quot;Tribune&quot; in the 1920s. Given the lack of schools of journalism in the midwestern United States at the time, McCormick and Patterson sponsored a school named for their grandfather, the Joseph Medill School of Journalism. It was announced by Walter Dill Scott in November 1920, and began classes in 1921.

As publisher of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, McCormick was involved in a number of legal disputes regarding freedom of the press that were handled by McCormick&#x27;s longtime lawyer Weymouth Kirkland. The most famous of these cases is &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot;, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), a case championed by McCormick in his role as chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association&#x27;s Committee on Free Speech.
A conservative Republican, McCormick was an opponent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and compared the New Deal to Communism. For a period in 1935, he protested Rhode Island&#x27;s Democratic judiciary by displaying a 47-star flag outside the Tribune building, with the 13th star (representing Rhode Island) removed; he relented after he was advised that alteration of the American flag was unlawful.

He was also an America First non-interventionist who strongly opposed entering World War II &quot;to rescue the British Empire&quot;. He famously published the &quot;Victory Program,&quot; a military plan that FDR had ordered in the summer of 1941 to prepare the United States for possible entry into World War II. It had been leaked to him by US Senator Burton K. Wheeler. The publication was on December 4, 1941, only three days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The controversy it stirred died off quickly after the December 7 attack. In June 1942, the &quot;Tribune&quot; published an article that indicated that the Americans had broken Japanese codes, the 1942 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; incident.

As a publisher he was very innovative. McCormick was a 25 percent owner of the Tribune&#x27;s 50,000 watt radio station, which was purchased in 1924; he named it WGN, the initials of the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s motto, the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper&quot;. He also established the town of Baie-Comeau, Quebec in 1936 and constructed a paper mill and a hydroelectric power plant there named McCormick Dam to generate electricity for the mill.

McCormick carried on crusades against various local, state, and national politicians, gangsters and racketeers, labor unions, prohibition and prohibitionists, Wall Street, the East and Easterners, Democrats, the New Deal and the Fair Deal, liberal Republicans, the League of Nations, the World Court, the United Nations, British imperialism, socialism, and communism. Besides Roosevelt, his chief targets included Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson and Illinois Governor Len Small. 

Some of McCormick&#x27;s personal crusades were seen as quixotic (such as his attempts to reform spelling of the English language) and were parodied in political cartoons in rival Frank Knox&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. Knox&#x27;s political cartoonists, including Cecil Jensen, derided McCormick as &quot;Colonel McCosmic&quot;, a &quot;pompous, paunchy, didactic individual with a bristling mustache and superlative ego.&quot;

In 1943, he told an audience he helped plan a defence against an invasion from Canada at the end of World War I.
In June 1947, he gave a 100-year birthday party for the &quot;Tribune&quot; that included a fireworks show called &quot;the most colossal show since the Chicago fire.&quot;
Other publications noted that everything about the celebration was called &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest&quot;. Time magazine editorialized that &quot;the &quot;Tribune&quot; has been made into a worldwide symbol of reaction, isolation, and prejudice by a man capable of real hate.&quot;

McCormick had purchased the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; newspaper following the 1948 death of Eleanor Medill &quot;Cissy&quot; Patterson, his first cousin. The paper was an &quot;isolationist and archconservative&quot; publication known for sensationalism. 

McCormick appointed his niece, then known as Ruth &quot;Bazy&quot; McCormick Miller as the publisher of the paper in 1949. He wanted Bazy to use the paper to create &quot;an outpost of American principles&quot;. When the two came to a parting of the ways over her relationship with one of the paper&#x27;s editors, Garvin Tankersley, as well as editorial control over the paper, he ordered her to choose between Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;. Bazy later said, &quot;I understood when I went to the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; I was to have full control. That control was not given me ... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [McCormick] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people.

McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper&#x27;s board members insisted that Bazy be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot; consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper.

===Family life and scandal===
McCormick married twice, but had no children from either marriage. His first wife was Amy Irwin, the former wife of his father&#x27;s first cousin, Edward Shields Adams. Starting in the summer of 1904, McCormick had spent much time at the homes of Adams in downtown Chicago and Lake Forest, Illinois. Amanda McCormick (1822–1891), youngest daughter of family patriarch Robert McCormick, had married fellow Virginian Hugh Adams (1820–1880) before moving to Chicago to start the McCormick &amp; Adams grain trading business. Their son, Edward Shields Adams, born in 1859, had married the much younger Amie de Houle &quot;Amy&quot; Irwin on April 15, 1895. She was born in 1872, the daughter of decorated soldier Bernard J. D. Irwin.

Starting in November 1913, a bitter family dispute developed. Amy Irwin Adams filed for divorce, claiming Adams was alcoholic, and the suit was granted on March 6, 1914, without her husband appearing in court. In September 1914, Adams filed another lawsuit. He sued McCormick for trespass and asked for the divorce case to be heard again. The opposition press made the most out of the scandals. Adams presented McCormick with a bill for eight years of lodging, and claimed McCormick had &quot;wickedly and maliciously debauched and carnally knew the said Amy Irwin Adams&quot; while his guest. Other allegations included that McCormick had a former chauffeur arrested and interrogated by a private detective. McCormick then counterclaimed that he had made loans to Adams which had to be repaid. The case was heard by Federal Court Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November. It was hinted that McCormick had promised to forgive the loans if Adams dropped his suit to reopen the divorce. Landis ruled in favor of McCormick in February 1915.

Following the settlement, on March 10, 1915, McCormick married Amy Irwin Adams, after waiting the year after the original divorce decree as was required by law at the time. The wedding occurred in London, in the registry office of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, with only two witnesses present. The &quot;Tribune&quot; did not mention the wedding, nor any of the previous lawsuits.

After Amy died in 1939, McCormick became a near social recluse. On December 21, 1944, he married Mrs. Maryland Mathison Hooper in the apartment of his cousin Chauncey McCormick. She was 47 and he was 64 at the time. She lived until July 21, 1985. In his later years and until his death, McCormick lived at the estate named Cantigny, in Wheaton, Illinois.

The childless McCormick for a time mentored his niece, Ruth (later Tankersley) to be the heir to his publishing empire. He was said to have &quot;doted&quot; on Bazy. When McCormick appointed her as the publisher of the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; in 1949, she was 28 years old and was given the title of vice-president. When Bazy divorced her husband in 1951, ultimately to elope with an editor at the paper, Garvin &quot;Tank&quot; Tankersley, the two came to a parting of the ways. McCormick considered Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because &quot;Tank&quot; was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. McCormick also disapproved of her divorce in general, which Bazy viewed as hypocritical, given McCormick&#x27;s own complicated personal life. When McCormick delivered the ultimatum that she choose between Garvin Tankersley and the paper, she resigned from the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.

==Personality==
McCormick was regarded as a &quot;remote, coldly aloof, ruthless aristocrat, living in lonely magnificence, disdaining the common people ... an exceptional man, a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to, but at the same time had to be feared; an eccentric, misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing, cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him.&quot; McCormick was described by one opponent as &quot;the greatest mind of the fourteenth century&quot; and by the American labor historian Art Preis as a &quot;fascist-minded multi-millionaire&quot;. In his memoirs, publisher Henry Regnery described his meeting with McCormick and William Henry Chamberlin:
The Colonel received us in his rather feudal office, high above Michigan Avenue at the top of his Gothic tower. He was a tall, erect, distinguished-looking man, who, with his white hair, blue eyes, ruddy complexion, white mustache, and in his manner and dress, conveyed the impression that he might have come from the English landed aristocracy. He was perfectly cordial, but gave us clearly to understand that our rather similar views on such matters as foreign policy and the administration in Washington were no basis for familiarity.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:
He did consider himself an aristocrat, and his imposing stature— tall, with a muscular body weighing over , his erect soldierly bearing, his reserved manner and his distinguished appearance—made it easy for him to play that role. But if he was one, he was an aristocrat, according to his friends, in the best sense of the word, despising the idle rich and having no use for parasites, dilettantes or mere pleasure-seekers, whose company, clubs and amusements he avoided. With an extraordinary capacity for hard work, he often put in seven long days a week at his job even when elderly, keeping fit through polo and later horseback riding. In his seventies, he could still get into the war uniform of his thirties.

==Death and legacy==
In failing health since an attack of pneumonia, following a trip to Europe in April 1953; McCormick nonetheless remained active in his work until the month before he died, on April 1, 1955. He was buried on his farm, in his war uniform. His second wife survived him by three decades. Upon his death, the childless McCormick left an estate estimated at $55 million, including stock in the Chicago Tribune Company. His will established a trust devoted to charitable purposes, including maintenance of his former home, which became Cantigny and includes a house and war museum as well as formal gardens.

The Northwestern University School of Law building that opened in 1962 was named McCormick Hall following a donation from the foundation.
After a donation to renovate the Technological Institute building at Northwestern University in 1989, the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science was also named for him.
Within days of McCormick&#x27;s death, Richard J. Daley was elected mayor and a new family would dominate Chicago, this time aligned with the Democratic Party for over half a century.
Since McCormick had long advocated building a convention center, after it was built from 1957 to 1960 McCormick Place was named for him.

The trust eventually divested its ownership of the Tribune Company, so in 2008 changed its name from the McCormick Tribune Foundation to the Robert R. McCormick Foundation. It contributed more than a billion US dollars for journalism, early childhood education, civic health, social and economic services, arts and culture and citizenship. 

McCormick endowed five scholarships at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina and deeded his Aiken, South Carolina estate to friend and former commander Charles Pelot Summerall with the stipulation that the General live there the remainder of his life. After Summerall&#x27;s death in 1954, the estate was sold and the proceeds used to purchase a beach house in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, now known as the Robert R. McCormick Citadel Beach Club. The structure was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and subsequently rebuilt and hosts many functions including weddings and corporate events.

McCormick&#x27;s legacy also extended to Canada, his grandfather Joseph Medill&#x27;s birthplace. Six towns were created for the purpose of forestry and journal paper production: Heron Bay (Ont.), Gore Bay (Ont), Thorold (Ont.), Baie-Comeau (Que), Franquelin (Que) and Shelter Bay (Que), known as Port-Cartier today. Many monuments have been made in honor of the Colonel, in Baie-Comeau lay the biggest of them all, a bronze statue of the Colonel canoeing as he did in 1915 when he discovered the land that would welcome the town in 1937. The monument was made by Wheeler Williams an American sculptor. In 1955 the Quebec &amp; Ontario Transportation Company renamed the cargo vessel the &quot;Manicouagan&quot; the &quot;Col. Robert R. McCormick&quot;.

<doc id="1125064" wikidata="Q1090298" url="?curid=1125064" title="Château-Chalon AOC">
<text>Château-Chalon () is an Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée for wines made in the Jura wine region of France, around the village of Château-Chalon. Only white wines from the Savagnin grape made in the &quot;vin jaune&quot; (&quot;yellow wine&quot;) style can be made using this appellation. However, the Château-Chalon wines are not explicitly labeled as &quot;vin jaune&quot;. It is bottled in the traditional bottle called that is of a peculiar shape and with a capacity of 62 cl, which is, according to local legend, the amount left of a litre of wine after aging in cask for six years and three months - the legal minimum for Chateau Chalon. Once bottled, the wine is of great longevity, and can age for several decades.

==Climate and geography==

Château-Chalon is located in hilly terrain in the eastern French wine region of Jura. The area has a continental climate, which includes very cold winters. The climate during harvest time is normally dry enough to be able to pick the grapes at a late harvest stage, normally in late October. The vineyard soils are composed of limestone marl.

==Wine production==

The Château-Chalon AOC is dedicated exclusively to the production of &quot;vin jaune&quot; wine. There are other appellations within Jura that are permitted to produce AOC &quot;vin jaune&quot;, most notably the Côtes du Jura AOC, but Château-Chalon has specific regulations that are unique to this AOC. To begin with, the grapes must be harvested at brix levels that allow for a potential alcohol content of at least 12% in the finished wine; other regions will allow a minimum of 11.5%. While the grapes are harvested late, they are never botrytized, unlike other well known late harvest French wines such as Sauternes. After fermentation the wine must be stored for at least six years and three months prior to bottling. The majority of time is spent in wood casks that are only partially filled, allowing for a film of yeast, known as the &quot;voile&quot; or &quot;veil&quot;, to develop across the surface. This &quot;voile&quot; yeast is similar to the benevolent &quot;flor&quot; yeast that is used in sherry production, and &quot;vin jaune&quot; shares some similarities in styles to sherry, though &quot;vin jaune&quot; is not fortified.

The producers of Château-Chalon are very particular about quality and will sacrifice an entire year&#x27;s production, not making any wine, if the weather of a particular vintage was not favorable. In good years, production will average around 2000 hectoliters (52,835 gallons).

==Wine style==
The &quot;vin jaune&quot; wine of Château-Chalon is known for its nutty flavors and aromas, and can develop additional curry notes as the wines ages due to presence of sotolon. The wine&#x27;s yellow color ranges from pale to deep gold. The wines are often paired with the local AOC designated chicken from the nearby town of Bresse.

<text>Thingwall is a village on the Wirral Peninsula, in Merseyside, England. The village is situated approximately to the south west of Birkenhead and north east of Heswall. Historically part of Cheshire, the area is within the Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West.

At the 2001 census, Thingwall had 3,140 inhabitants. 
The 2011 census registered the total ward population at 13,007.

==History==
From the Old Norse , meaning &#x27;assembly field&#x27;, the name indicates that it was once the site of a Germanic &quot;thing&quot; (or &quot;þing&quot;). Similar place names in the British Isles include Tynwald, Dingwall, and Tingwall; see also Thingvellir in Iceland and Tingvoll in Norway. A place called &quot;Tingvalla&quot; can also be found in the swedish town Karlstad where it can be dated back to the viking age as a councel- and marketplace.

The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Tuigvelle&quot;, and has been variously known as &quot;Fingwalle&quot; (1180); &quot;Thingale&quot; (circa 1250); &quot;Thynghwall&quot; (1426).
Thingwall was formerly a township in the parish of Woodchurch, in Wirral Hundred, in 1866 Thingwall became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Birkenhead St Mary and became part of Birkenhead county borough. The population was 52 in 1801, 96 in 1851, 156 in 1901 and 652 in 1931.

Traditional buildings/walls in the area are constructed of locally-quarried yellow sandstone. Several small sandstone quarries once existed in the area including one at the top of the appropriately named Quarry Lane. Little evidence of these quarries now exists as the land has been redeveloped for housing or for the construction of a second above-ground fresh water reservoir.

Thingwall Mill was constructed in the eighteenth century on the site of a much older medieval mill. Damaged in a storm in 1897 and subsequently disused, the mill was demolished in 1900. However, remnants of the building, including the original millstone, can still be found on Mill Road.

Thingwall Hall was built in 1849 for a Liverpool merchant and demolished in 1960. It was part of the Royal Liverpool Children&#x27;s Hospital from 1917, providing care for long-term patients.

On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including Thingwall, being transferred from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside.

==Geography==
Thingwall lies on the western side of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Hoylake, from the Dee Estuary and about from the River Mersey at Rock Ferry. Thingwall sits at the western side of the wide and shallow glacial U-shaped valley, formed during the Quaternary Ice Age, between Thurstaston Hill and Storeton Ridge. The underlying bedrock is Triassic sandstone of the Helsby Sandstone Formation and the Wilmslow Sandstone Formation, and Triassic siltstone of the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. This is overlain with boulder clay from the Quaternary Ice Age, similar to the nearby Dee Cliffs, and clay soil. The bedrock is not usually visible, as it is at the summit of Thurstaston Hill.

==Governance==
Thingwall is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. The village is part of the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current Member of Parliament is Margaret Greenwood, a Labour Party (UK) representative.

At local government level, the village is part of the Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Thingwall is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021.

<doc id="1125077" wikidata="Q5130586" url="?curid=1125077" title="Cleanse Fold and Manipulate">
<text>Cleanse Fold and Manipulate is the third studio album by Canadian electro-industrial group Skinny Puppy. The album was released in 1987 and was supported by a single, &quot;Addiction&quot;. The album was further supported by the &quot;Head Trauma&quot; tour, which spanned across North America and Europe. &quot;Ain&#x27;t it Dead Yet?&quot;, a recording of the group performing in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was released on video in 1989 and CD in 1991.

==Music==
&quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot; explores a number of different topics concerning medicine, society, and politics. The song &quot;First Aid&quot; addresses what was the growing AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, while &quot;Second Tooth&quot; concerns with the struggles faced by Vietnam War veterans, namely post-traumatic stress. The song &quot;Deep Down Trauma Hounds&quot; was written following a string of teenage suicides in the United States. Nivek Ogre, the group&#x27;s vocalist and songwriter, said of the suicides:

Other songs on the album pay homage to horror films. The song &quot;The Mourn&quot; is based on the Japanese extreme horror movie &quot;Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot; from the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; film series. According to the group, the film was the closest they had ever come to seeing what they felt was a real snuff movie. Footage from the film has since been used in their live shows.

==Release==
&quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot; was released on June 25, 1987. Eyeball paperweights were distributed by Capitol Records to help promote the album. The record sold 80,000 copies by October 1988, with 90 percent of sales being outside Canada.

=== Critical reception ===

Tim DiGravina of AllMusic said the album was &quot;hard to recommend&quot;. He went on to say while it did contain one of the band&#x27;s best songs, &quot;Deep Down Trauma Hounds&quot;, much of the album was ambient and fragmentary. Still, he added, &quot;fans of industrial music will appreciate the album&#x27;s formidable beats and coarse sound samples that seem to be generated from warping the sounds of heavy machinery. Perhaps more than other any place in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s discography, Ogre&#x27;s vocals work like spoken-word stream-of-conscious dementia, with more emphasis on evil tones than on any relation to their music&quot;. He concluded by saying the album was primarily recommendable to die hard fans. Evelyn Erskine from the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; gave the album a favorable review, saying the album was &quot;dark and frightening&quot;, and described the flow of its songs as &quot;cinematic&quot;. Erskine remarked that the album was weakened by the band&#x27;s overreliance on gothic horror elements. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine recommended the album, calling it &quot;the right combination of gloom-and-doom lyrics and throbbing, metallic music&quot;.

&quot;People&quot; magazine said listening to the album was &quot;like stepping into a nightmare being experienced by the Phantom of the Opera&quot; and concluded that the band was &quot;too garish for extended exposure but, in small doses, they are extremely powerful&quot;. Mike Saunders of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; thought the album was an intriguing accomplishment, but that the initial &quot;voyeuristic thrill&quot; received from listening wears off before the album ends. Frances Litman from the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; thought the album was tamer than the band&#x27;s previous work and only recommended it to club-goers.

== Track listing ==
==Additional notes ==
*To promote the album, Capitol Records (who were responsible for the release of Skinny Puppy music outside of Canada) distributed eyeball paperweights.
*&quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot; is a cyclical album: the end of track 10, &quot;Epilogue&quot;, segues into the beginning of track 1, &quot;First Aid.&quot;
*In response to the cover&#x27;s source image by Gilmore: &quot;It is an image from the original 1960s movie of &quot;Village Of The Damned&quot;. There is a little tongue-in-cheek history behind using that image as the manager for Images In Vogue, a band that C. Key used to be in before Skinny Puppy, was a former child model from England and had a role in the movie. But the face on the cover was another child actor from the movie.&quot;
*&quot;Draining Faces&quot; was featured on &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; soundtrack.

<doc id="1125082" wikidata="Q265614" url="?curid=1125082" title="List of Pennsylvania state parks">
<text>, there are 124 state parks in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks, a division of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), is the governing body for all these parks, and directly operates 116 of them. The remaining parks are operated in cooperation with other public and private organizations.

The first Pennsylvania state park, at Valley Forge, opened in 1893 and was given to the National Park Service (NPS) for the United States Bicentennial in 1976. There are a total of seventeen former Pennsylvania state parks: four former parks have been transferred to the NPS, four to the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission, two to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one to both the Corps and the Pennsylvania Game Commission, five to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, and one has ceased to exist. Nine current and two former state parks have had major name changes or have been known under alternate names.

The list gives an overview of Pennsylvania state parks and a brief history of their development since the first park opened in 1893. State parks range in size from to and comprise one percent of Pennsylvania&#x27;s total land area. According to Dan Cupper (1993), &quot;Pennsylvania is the thirty-third largest state, but only Alaska and California have more park land&quot;.

==Overview==
There are state parks in 62 of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 67 counties, which nearly reaches Pennsylvania&#x27;s goal of having a state park within 25 miles (40 km) of every resident in the Commonwealth. Eleven parks do not have &quot;State Park&quot; in their name. Three are &quot;Conservation Areas&quot;: Boyd Big Tree Preserve, Joseph E. Ibberson, and Varden; four are &quot;Environmental Education Centers&quot;: Jacobsburg, Jennings, Kings Gap (also a &quot;Training Center&quot;) and Nolde Forest; White Clay Creek is a &quot;Preserve&quot;; Norristown is a &quot;Farm Park&quot;; and Big Spring is a &quot;State Forest Picnic Area&quot;.

Seven parks are undeveloped with no facilities: Allegheny Islands, Benjamin Rush, Bucktail, Erie Bluffs, Prompton, Swatara, and Varden; the last four of these are in the process of being developed. Five state parks are small picnic areas: Laurel Summit, Patterson, Prouty Place, Sand Bridge, and Upper Pine Bottom. Five state parks have major U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams and/or lakes: Bald Eagle, Beltzville, Elk, Kettle Creek, and Sinnemahoning. Three former parks now belong, at least partly, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Seven parks preserve the industrial past: Canoe Creek is the site of a former lime kiln, and Caledonia, French Creek, Greenwood Furnace, Kings Gap, Mont Alto, and Pine Grove Furnace (plus one former park) are all former iron furnace sites. Eight current parks and one former park contain at least part of eight different National Natural Landmarks.

According to the DCNR, the state parks in Pennsylvania are on more than with some 606 full-time and more than 1,600 part-time employees serving approximately 36 million visitors each year. Admission to all Pennsylvania state parks is free, although there are fees charged for use of cabins, marinas, etc. Pennsylvania&#x27;s state parks offer &quot;over 7,000 family campsites, 286 cabins, nearly 30,000 picnic tables, 56 major recreational lakes, 10 marinas, 61 beaches for swimming, 17 swimming pools&quot; and over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of trails.

==History==
Pennsylvania&#x27;s first state park was Valley Forge State Park, purchased by the Commonwealth on May 30, 1893, to preserve Valley Forge. It was transferred to the National Park Service (NPS) on the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Many state parks still preserve history: as of 2012, forty-two Pennsylvania state park sites are on the National Register of Historic Places, including two National Historic Landmarks (Delaware Canal and Point), twenty-eight Civilian Conservation Corps sites in nineteen parks, and twelve other parks&#x27; historic sites and districts. Eight of the former state parks were also chiefly historic.

In addition to preserving historic sites, Pennsylvania also sought to preserve natural beauty and offer opportunities for recreation in its state parks. In 1902 Mont Alto State Forest Park was the second park established, a year after the state &quot;Bureau of Forestry&quot; was set up to purchase, preserve, and restore Pennsylvania&#x27;s forests, which had been ravaged by lumbering, charcoal production, and wild fires. Parks were added sporadically until the 1930s, some mere camping and picnic areas in state forests, while others preserved unique sites. The 1930s saw a great expansion of parks and their facilities under Governor Gifford Pinchot, who cooperated with President Franklin Roosevelt, despite their being of different political parties. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) established 113 CCC camps in Pennsylvania (second only to California). Using CCC and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor, the NPS built five Recreation Demonstration Areas, which became Pennsylvania state parks in 1945 and 1946: Blue Knob, French Creek, Hickory Run, Laurel Hill, and Raccoon Creek. The CCC also &quot;fought forest fires, planted trees, built roads, buildings, picnic areas, swimming areas, campgrounds and created many state parks&quot;.

In 1956, there were forty-four state parks in Pennsylvania, mostly in rural areas. Forty-five parks had been added by 1979, mostly near urban areas, and the system had increased by . This was thanks largely to the efforts of Maurice K. Goddard, who served as director of the precursors to the DCNR for twenty-four years under six administrations. The number of visitors to parks more than tripled in this time and two voter approved bond issues (Projects 70 and 500) raised millions of dollars for park expansions and improvements. All this expansion was not without costs and by 1988 there was an estimated $90 million in deferred maintenance. In 1993, as the park system celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary, new tax and bond revenues were earmarked for the parks. Since 2000, parks are being improved through the state&#x27;s Growing Greener and Growing Greener II and bond programs.

==Current parks==
==Other names of current parks==
The following are significantly different former or alternate names for nine current Pennsylvania state parks. Note that many parks were originally &quot;State Forest Parks&quot; or were state public camping or picnic areas in Pennsylvania state forests. In modern times, some &quot;State Parks&quot; have become &quot;Environmental Education Centers&quot;, while other parks have dropped one word from their name (&quot;Cherry Springs Drive&quot; is now Cherry Springs, &quot;Codorus Creek&quot; is now Codorus, &quot;Kooser Lake&quot; is now Kooser, &quot;Laurel Hill Summit&quot; is now Laurel Summit, and &quot;Promised Land Lake&quot; is now Promised Land). Such minor name changes are not included in this table.

==Former parks==
The following eighteen were once Pennsylvania state parks, but have been transferred to federal (National Park Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) or state (Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry) agencies, or ceased to exist.


==Other names of former parks==
The following are significantly different former or alternate names for two former Pennsylvania state parks. One former park dropped one word from its name (&quot;Colerain Forge&quot; became &quot;Colerain&quot; sometime between 1924 and 1937). Such minor name changes are not included in this table.

==Notes==

:a. As of 2012, three Pennsylvania state parks are also the site of ski areas run by private contractors: Big Pocono (Ski Camelback), Blue Knob (Ski Blue Knob), and Denton Hill (Ski Denton). (Two other state parks had commercial ski operations in the past Laurel Mountain (from 1939 to 2005) and Black Moshannon (from 1965 to 1982).) Two parks are operated by other governmental bodies: Hillman (managed for hunting by the Pennsylvania Game Commission) and Norristown Farm (operated by the Montgomery County Department of Parks). Three parks are operated by other organizations: Susquehanna (operated by the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce), Prompton (operated by non-profit &quot;Friends of Prompton&quot;), and Salt Springs (operated by non-profit &quot;Friends of Salt Springs&quot;).
:b. The Pennsylvania counties without state parks as of 2023 are: Armstrong, Juniata, Lehigh, Montour, and Snyder counties. Two of these counties are sites of former state parks: Crooked Creek in Armstrong County, and Snyder-Middleswarth in Snyder County.
:c. The goal of having a state park within 25 miles (40 km) of every resident was set by Maurice K. Goddard (Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, and then of the Department of Environmental Resources from 1955 to 1979).
:d. The seven National Natural Landmarks at least partly within current state parks (with the park name in parentheses, if different) are: Cook Forest, Ferncliff Peninsula (Ohiopyle), the Glens Natural Area (Ricketts Glen), Hickory Run Boulder Field (Hickory Run), McConnells Mill, the Pine Creek Gorge (includes Colton Point and Leonard Harrison), and Presque Isle. One National Natural Landmark, Snyder Middleswarth Natural Area, is a former state park.
:e. The date of establishment for many Pennsylvania state parks is not always clear, especially for parks developed from state forest property. As an example, consider Upper Pine Bottom, which, as of 2012, is a picnic area surrounded by Tiadaghton State Forest. These state forest lands were acquired by the state by the early 1900s, the site was &quot;Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Campground&quot; by 1924, the CCC built a pavilion there in 1936 (which is no longer extant), but it was not officially transferred from the Bureau of Forests to State Parks until 1962.
:f. This park was one of twenty-five chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its &quot;25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot; list.
:g. This park has one or more historic sites or districts on the National Register of Historic Places.
:h. There have been a considerable number of changes in Pennsylvania&#x27;s categorization of its state parks and other protected areas over the years, so that what can be called a former state park is not always clear. This can be seen by comparing the following three lists from 1923, 1924, and 1937. In 1923, the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters listed seven &quot;State Forest Parks&quot;: Caledonia, Childs (now part of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area), Hairy John&#x27;s (now a picnic area in Bald Eagle State Forest), James Buchanan, Leonard Harrison, Mont Alto, and Valhalla (now Ole Bull). Note this does not include Snyder-Middleswarth State Forest Park, established in 1921. One year later the state listed twenty-six public campgrounds in state forests, which included three of the previous year&#x27;s state forest parks, plus twelve sites that later became state parks. The ten Class A Public Campgrounds (with space for cars and tents, on main highways) were: Adams Falls (now Linn Run), Big Spring, Caledonia, Childs, Colerain Forge, Darling Run, Laurel Run Park, Ole Bull, Promised Land, and Tea Springs. The sixteen Class B Public Campgrounds (lean-to shelter, on secondary roads) were: Baldwin, Bear Valley, Cherry Springs Drive, Clear Creek, Donnelly, Joyce Kilmer, Kansas, Kooser, Laurel Hill Summit (now Laurel Summit), Laurel Lake Park, Locusts, McCall&#x27;s Dam, Ravensburg, Sizerville, Sulphur Springs, and Upper Pine Bottom. In 1937, the state published a brochure listing the following forty-nine protected areas: six State Parks (Caledonia, Childs, Cook Forest, Presque Isle, Pymatuning, and Ralph Stover); eight State Monuments (Bushy Run, Conrad Weiser, Drake Well, Fort Necessity, Fort Washington, James Buchanan, Valley Forge, and Washington Crossing); ten Forest Recreational Reserves (Clear Creek, Colton Point, Cowans Gap, Kooser Lake, Parker Dam, Pecks Pond, Promised Land Lake, Snow Hill, Whipple Dam, Whirl&#x27;s End); sixteen Wayside Areas (Big Spring, Black Moshannon, Cherry Spring, Colerain, Greenwood Furnace, Halfway (now R.B. Winter), Joyce Kilmer, Kettle Creek, Mont Alto, Pine Grove Furnace, Reeds Gap, S.B. Elliott, Sideling Hill, Sizerville, and Tea Spring); seven Forest Monuments (Alan Seeger, Bear Meadows, Ole Bull, Detweiler Run, McConnell Narrows, Mount Logan, and Snyder-Middleswarth); and three State Forest Lookouts (Leonard Harrison, Martins Hill, and Mount Riansares). Only twelve of the twenty-six public campgrounds from 1924 are on the 1937 list. Of the forty-nine areas on the 1937 list, twenty-eight are state parks as of 2012, while nine are former state parks, and twelve are in state forests (eight of these still retain their names as state forest picnic, natural or wild areas).

<text>Hans Jenny (7 February 1899 – 9 January 1992) was a Swiss-born soil scientist and expert on pedology (the study of soil in its natural environment), particularly the processes of soil formation. He served as 1949 President of the Soil Science Society of America.

== Overview ==

Hans Jenny was born in Basel, Switzerland. He earned a diploma in agriculture from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in 1922, and a D. Sc. degree in 1927 for a thesis on ion exchange reactions.

Following an appointment at the University of Missouri, he joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley in 1936. International recognition came to Jenny after the 1941 publication of &quot;Factors of Soil Formation: A System of Quantitative Pedology&quot;. His synthesis of field studies with the abstract formalism of physical chemistry set down the generic mathematical relationship that connects the observed properties of soil with the independent factors that determine the process of soil formation:

s = f(cl, o, r, p, t, ...)

where s - soil properties; cl - regional climate; o - potential biota, r - relief; p - parent material; t - time.

Jenny left the ellipsis open to indicate that there might be other variables in the function.

In &quot;The Soil Resource, Origin and Behaviour&quot; (1980), Jenny redefined the soil forming factors as state variables and extended the effects to ecosystem properties. Parent material and relief define the initial state for soil development, regional climate, and potential biota, determine the rate at which chemical and biological transformations proceed, and time determines the reach of these processes and their expression in ecosystem, soil, vegetation, and animal component properties.

One notable project was his study of the Mendocino pygmy forest, a remarkable community of ericaceous and coniferous plant species whose stunted growth and grotesquely twisted morphology reveal a long and tortured struggle for survival on a 500,000-year-old marine . The University of California&#x27;s Jenny Pygmy Forest Reserve is named in his honor and is found adjacent to Van Damme State Park. Jenny did much of his pygmy forest research within the boundaries of Jug Handle State Natural Reserve, which, due to Hans and his wife Jean&#x27;s lobbying, was designated the Pygmy Forest National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1974.

Jenny applied fundamental soil science to the problems of the day when he wrote about &quot;the rosy outlook that is sweeping the nation about converting biomass to alcohol and gasohol...We are promised construction of ingenious machines that will pick up all crop residues in the fields and leaf litter and humus in the forests. The carbon and nitrogen cycles of ecosystems will be curtailed and soil stability endangered. Because of a possible climatic warm-up, we do not wish to accelerate humus oxidation and the concomitant flux of carbon dioxide from soil into the atmosphere. I am arguing against indiscriminate conversion of biomass and organic wastes to fuels. The humus capital, which is substantial, deserves being maintained because good soils are a national asset.&quot;

<text>Irby () is a village on the Wirral Peninsula, in Merseyside, England. The village covers an area of 20 square kilometres. To the north of Irby lies the associated hamlet of Irby Hill. It is part of the Greasby, Frankby and Irby Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and is within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West.

According to the 2001 census, Irby had a population of 6,110, By the time of the 2011 census a separate statistic for Irby was no longer maintained. However, the total population of Greasby, Frankby and Irby Ward was 13,991.

==History==

The name Irby &quot;(Iri býr)&quot; is of Viking origin, meaning &quot;farmstead or settlement of the Irish&quot;. It is derived from the Old Norse words &quot;Íri&quot; (Irishman) and &quot;bȳ&quot; (a farmstead or settlement). Historically, the name has been spelt as &quot;Irreby&quot; (1096) and &quot;Ireby&quot; (1232). 
Other nearby towns and villages with the Viking &quot;by&quot; suffix in their name include Frankby, Greasby and Pensby.

Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, the land of the present day village was recorded as being granted to the Abbey of St Werburgh by Hugh Lupus in 1093.

===Irby Mill===
A reference to the existence of a mill at Irby was made in a rental agreement of 1431, whereby tenants were expected to &quot;...grind at Irby Mill to the 16th measure.&quot; This referred to the miller receiving this amount in flour as a toll. This original wooden structure was replaced by a post mill in the early 18th century. After being disused since about 1878 and in a very dilapidated condition, the mill was demolished in 1898. Along with a similar structure in Burton, it was one of the last post mills of its kind on the Wirral. The demolition work was carried out by unskilled labour hired by the miller. They removed the brick base first, resulting in the whole structure becoming dangerously unsafe and crashing to the ground, narrowly avoiding injury or loss of life. 
The Irby Mill public house, which opened for business in 1980, stands adjacent to the site in a building formerly known as Irby Mill Cottage.

===Irby Hall===
Irby Hall was constructed in the early 17th century, with an entrance facade added in 1888. The hall was built on the site of an 11th-century moated manor and courthouse of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey. The moat is now dry, but has a prominent outer bank. Irby Hall was made a Grade II listed building in 1962.

==Geography, geology and environment==
Irby lies on the western side of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Hoylake, from the Dee Estuary and about from the River Mersey at Tranmere. Irby sits on the eastern side of Thurstaston Hill, at the western side of a wide and shallow glacial U-shaped valley, formed during the Quaternary Ice Age. The underlying bedrock is Triassic bunter sandstone of the Helsby Sandstone Formation, and Triassic siltstone of the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. This is overlain with boulder clay from the Quaternary Ice Age, similar to the nearby Dee Cliffs, and clay soil. The bedrock is not usually visible, as it is at the summit of Thurstaston Hill.

The highest point in Irby is above sea level, on Irby Road, near to Irby Hall, in the centre of the village. The higher prominence of Thurstaston Hill is at above sea level, to the west. All of the populated area is more than above sea level, and the ground is on a gentle hillside.

Irby is bounded by Greasby Brook, to the west, which also travels through and alongside Thurstaston Common. The brook has its source in the fields to the south-west of Irby. Meanwhile, Irby is bounded to the north, east and south by part of the field drainage which forms Arrowe Brook.

===Climate===
Irby has a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), similar to much of the rest of the United Kingdom. Being close to the sea and sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly wind by Snowdonia, the area has relatively warm summers. The winters are generally mild and wet, mornings with light frost are common, and there are few days of snow. The nearest official weather station, as the crow flies, is at Hall Road in Crosby, which is about to the north.

==Demographics==
The population was 96 in 1801, 180 in 1851 and 146 in 1901. Whilst not being diverse in terms of ethnicity, Irby is an economically diverse neighbourhood, possessing a mixture of large 1930s built private houses together with an estate of 1970s built homes in a range of sizes and an element of 1950s built council housing all in close proximity. In this respect it is regarded locally as a very desirable place to live. Irby is within the catchment area for two local grammar schools: Calday Grange Grammar School for Boys and West Kirby Grammar School for Girls. Despite the typically suburban character of most of its neighbourhoods, Irby is surrounded on all sides by a large amount of green belt and woodland.

==Governance==
Historically within the county of Cheshire, Irby was formerly a township in the Thurstaston and Woodchurch parishes of the Wirral Hundred. In 1866 Irby became a separate civil parish. Irby was part of Wirral Rural Sanitary District from 1866, then Wirral Rural District from 1894 and Wirral Urban District from 1933. In 1951 the parish had a population of 4032. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. Further changes occurred on 1 April 1974, when local government reorganisation resulted in most of Wirral, including Irby, transfer from Cheshire to the newly formed metropolitan county of Merseyside.

As of , Irby is incorporated into the Greasby, Frankby and Irby Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. It is represented on Wirral Borough Council by three Labour councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 4 May 2023.

The village is part of the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. It is currently represented by Labour MP Matthew Patrick. 

Earlier MPs have included Selwyn Lloyd, a former Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons, as well as William Lever, the founder of Lever Brothers.

==Economy==
===Shops===

Irby&#x27;s small shopping area has a Morrisons local convenience store, which includes a branch of the Post Office. The shopping area also includes hairdressers, a florist, fast food outlets, restaurants and an off licence.

===Services===
Arrowe Park Hospital is about a mile from the centre of the village, and includes an Accident and Emergency department. Irby is served by a pharmacy and a dentist.

Irby has an MOT test centre on Mill Hill Road. The Irby telephone exchange serves 6,653 residential premises and 155 non-residential premises. The exchange is operated by BT and provides ADSL services, among others.

==Community==
===Schools===
Pensby High School is the nearest state secondary school. Irby Primary School is the local state primary school, with Dawpool CofE primary school also being nearby, towards Thurstaston. However children from the area attend many other schools on Wirral; Calday Grange Grammar School, West Kirby Grammar School, Birkenhead School, Birkenhead Preparatory School, Birkenhead High School to name five.

===Churches===

Irby has three churches. Two of these are the Irby Methodist Church and the Irby Evangelical Church. Meanwhile, St. Chad&#x27;s Church is a branch of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in Thurstaston. Frank Lester was a previous organist of the Methodist chapel.

===Leisure===
Irby has a village hall, situated on Thingwall Road, which hosted a performance by The Beatles on 7 September 1962. The village is home to the 1st Thurstaston scout group, which was started in 1933, shortly after the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, held about a mile away, in Arrowe Park, in 1929. The Irby Club was formed in the early 1930s, and is in the centre of the village, in a building which was once the farm house for the former Rookery Farm. Irby Library is on Thurstaston Road and was built in the late 1960s on the site of the 18th century Manor Farm. The library has its own group of local volunteers or &#x27;friends&#x27;.

====Public houses====

The Anchor Inn is one of the oldest buildings in Irby, and, according to an entry in the BBC Domesday Project, was built as a cottage in the 17th century. The Shippons is on Thingwall Road and is a sandstone village pub, converted from old farm buildings. The Irby Mill is away from the centre of the village, at Irby Hill, towards Greasby. This is a converted miller&#x27;s cottage constructed in the early 19th century, which had its original windmill demolished in 1898.

====Parks and commons====
Arrowe Park is approximately east of the village, and Thurstaston Common is a few hundred metres to the west.

===Sport===
Irby has a cricket club situated on Mill Hill Road, which was established in 1948 and promoted to the Cheshire County League in 2001. The club operates four teams every Saturday. In the 2008 season, the 1st team, 2nd team and 3rd team were all promoted. For many years the 3rd and 4th XI&#x27;s played their home games at the Seaview Lane cricket field until an adjacent field was obtained at the Mill Hill ground.

Irby&#x27;s local football club has teams ranging from under 8&#x27;s to men&#x27;s. Inaugurated in 1992, the senior team won the local league in the 2008/09 season. The team motto reads &quot;Semper Paratus&quot; meaning &#x27;Always Ready&#x27;. In earlier years Irby North End, playing at Seaview, enjoyed some success in the national John White League from 1972 to 1977.

Irby also has its own Taekwon-Do School based at Irby Village Hall with separate adult and children&#x27;s classes

==Transport==
The Merseytravel Saveaway ticket may be used on public transport in Merseyside. Prices are determined by Adult and Child status and the ticket is valid for one day. This ticket may also be used to cross the River Mersey on the Mersey Ferry, on direct services only. However these tickets may not be usd between 06.31 and 09.29 Monday-Friday.

The nearest railway station is Heswall (formerly Heswall Hills) on the Borderlands line. Trains depart from here for Wrexham and Bidston. From Irby, accessing the station is difficult via other public transport, and it is approximately a 45-minute walk away and offers only hourly services. Alternatively, buses may be used exclusively or to travel to West Kirby station, which is on the Wirral line of the high-frequency Merseyrail network.

<text>Hans Jenny (16 August 1904 in Basel – 23 June 1972 in Dornach) was a Swiss physician and natural scientist who coined the term &quot;cymatics&quot; to describe acoustic effects of sound wave phenomena.

==Life and career==
Jenny was born in Basel, Switzerland. After completing a doctorate he taught science at the Rudolph Steiner School in Zürich for four years before beginning medical practice.

In 1967, Jenny published the first volume of &quot;Cymatics: The Study of Wave Phenomena.&quot; The second volume came out in 1972, the year he died. This book was a written and photographic documentation of the effects of sound vibrations on fluids, powders and liquid paste. He concluded, &quot;This is not an unregulated chaos; it is a dynamic but ordered pattern.&quot;

Jenny made use of crystal oscillators and his so-called tonoscope to set plates and membranes vibrating. He spread quartz sand onto a black drum membrane 60 cm in diameter. The membrane was caused to vibrate by singing loudly through a cardboard pipe, and the sand produced symmetrical Chladni patterns, named after Ernst Chladni, who had discovered this phenomenon in 1787. Low tones resulted in rather simple and clear pictures, while higher tones formed more complex structures.

==Legacy==
Chladni&#x27;s and Jenny&#x27;s work influenced Alvin Lucier and helped lead to his composition &quot;Queen of the South&quot;. Cymatics was also followed up by Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) founder György Kepes at MIT. His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made visible by this setup. A special edition of the Hafler Trio&#x27;s work &quot;Exactly As I Say&quot; includes a DVD containing material said to be &quot;based on and extended from techniques suggested by Prof. Hans Jenny&quot;.
Photographer Alexander Lauterwasser has also captured imagery of water surfaces set into motion by sound sources ranging from sine waves to music by Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen and overtone singing.

<text>Dmytro Hennadiiovych Kovalenko (born August 28, 1977) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

He spent the majority of his playing career in the United States after moving there in 1992, most notably for Chicago Fire and D.C. United. His DC team won the MLS Cup in 2004. He retired from the game in February 2011 after being released by Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the 2010 season.

== Career ==

=== Early life and amateur ===
Born in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (now Kyiv, Ukraine), Kovalenko emigrated to the United States in 1992. He started to play football in the Dynamo Kyiv academy and toured the United States with the Dynamo&#x27;s junior squad in 1990 when he was spotted by one of college coaches and invited to the United States. He graduated from Greece Arcadia High School in Rochester, New York in 1996, and played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1996 to 1998, where he helped the Hoosiers win a national championship in 1998, and was named an NCAA first team All-American in the same year. Was long known in college for his powerful headers, which often left opponents stunned and unable to react to deflections from the goalkeeper or posts. Kovalenko often attributed this to his well developed neck muscles that he said were created from doing hundreds of sets of Ukrainian neck-snaps daily prior to his soccer training.

=== Professional ===
Upon joining the league, Kovalenko was originally allocated to the Dallas Burn, but the league complied with his demands to play for the Chicago Fire, engineering a trade to the team in exchange for draft picks. Kovalenko appeared infrequently in his rookie year, playing only 291 minutes in 11 games, but managed to score three goals for the team. Kovalenko made an impact another way, breaking the leg, and effectively ending the career, of Dallas Burn defender Brandon Pollard with a dangerous tackle.

Kovalenko would come into his own as a player in the 2000 season, scoring ten goals and five assists in 31 games for the Fire, as he helped the team to a U.S. Open Cup victory. The next year, he was moved from a forward position to attacking midfield, but continued to catalyze the Fire offense, scoring eight goals and seven assists in 25 games. In 2001, Kovalenko had trouble scoring, registering only one goal with his eight assists, but was still a dangerous offensive player for the team.

After the 2001 MLS season, Kovalenko played on loan for FC St. Pauli of the German Bundesliga. Following the 2002 season he was traded, largely because of salary cap problems, to D.C. United in exchange for youngster Justin Mapp. Kovalenko immediately established himself with United, scoring six goals in 24 games in his first season with the team. Also, in what seemed like something of a recurring trend, Kovalenko was again involved in a Dallas Burn injury, when another late tackle broke Burn midfielder Ronnie O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s leg, causing him to miss most of the regular season. Kovalenko was fined $1,000 and suspended one game for his actions. Kovalenko continued to be a valuable player in central midfield for D.C. United in 2004, registering two goals and ten assists for the team in 25 games. He was ejected from the championship game for a handball, but DC United held on to win. In 2005, despite losing the early part of the season to a broken foot, he tallied four goals and four assists. He left DC United in January 2006, after being unable to agree on salary terms, and returned to Ukraine. He signed a one-year contract with FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhia.

In August 2006, Kovalenko returned to MLS, after his rights were acquired by New York Red Bulls from DC. The fiery Ukrainian&#x27;s play in the beginning of the 2007 season had New York challenging in the Eastern Conference, however he was sidelined with injury and the team began to struggle. Kovalenko was able to return during the latter part of the season, helping the club clinch a playoff berth. He concluded the season appearing in 19 league matches, registering two goals and one assist. He was traded to Real Salt Lake in February 2008.

On 14 January 2009, Salt Lake traded Kovalenko to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a draft pick and an undisclosed sum of allocation money.

On 3 December 2010, LA Galaxy announced Kovalenko&#x27;s contract would not be renewed for the 2011 MLS season. Kovalenko elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a Major League Soccer free agent when he was not selected by any club.

Having been unable to secure a spot on a professional roster for the upcoming season, Kovalenko confirmed his retirement in an interview on 14 February 2011.

<doc id="1125149" wikidata="Q3428914" url="?curid=1125149" title="Reynolds Group Holdings">
<text>Reynolds Group Holdings was a New Zealand–based packaging company with roots in the former Reynolds Metals Company, which was the second-largest aluminum company in the United States, and the third-largest in the world. Reynolds Metals was acquired by Alcoa in Reynolds Group Holdings became Pactiv Evergreen through an IPO in 2020.
Reynolds Metals became known for the consumer product Reynolds Wrap foil, as well as for developing and promoting new uses for aluminum. Its RV &quot;Aluminaut&quot; submarine was operated by Reynolds Submarine Services Corporation.

It was headquartered for most of its existence in Richmond, Virginia; the Modernist style Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters was built there in 1958.

==History==
The Reynolds Metals Company was founded in 1919 as the U.S. Foil Company in Louisville, Kentucky, by Richard S. Reynolds Sr., nephew of tobacco king R. J. Reynolds. Initially, the new company supplied lead and tin foil wrappers to cigarette and candy companies. In 1924, U.S. Foil purchased the manufacturer of Eskimo Pies, which were wrapped in foil. In 1928, Reynolds purchased Robertshaw Thermostat, Fulton Sylphon, and part of Beechnut Foil, adding them to U.S. Foil to create Reynolds Metals. In 1931, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and in 1938 the headquarters moved again to Richmond, Virginia.

The company began producing aluminum foil for packaging in 1926. Reynolds Metals created the first high-speed, gravure-printed foil, aluminum bottle labels, heat-sealed foil bags for foods and foil-laminated building insulation paper. In 1940, Reynolds Metals began mining bauxite (aluminum ore) in Bauxite, Arkansas, and opened its first aluminum plant near Sheffield, Alabama, the following year. In 1947, the company released Reynolds Wrap Aluminum Foil. Reynolds Metals pioneered the development of aluminum siding in 1945, and Richard S. Reynolds began predicting a growing demand for additional aluminum during peacetime. He believed new aluminum-producing facilities would need to be built to meet demand. Reynolds Metals Company leased, and later bought, six government defense plants that were up for disposal. Reynolds later expanded into non aluminum products such as plastics and precious metals, introducing Reynolds Plastic Wrap in 1982.

After the Second World War, the sense of aluminum&#x27;s utility expanded to include its ornamental characteristics. By repurposing military by-products into consumer goods, aluminum was now being marketed for its decorative appeal as well, creating a product of both functional and eye-catching qualities. Reynolds advertised aluminum for its multi-faceted property, now reaching areas of fashion, home improvement, and architecture. Reynolds marketed aluminum foil as gift wrap, aluminum yarn for Vogue dress patterns, and even extended their advertising strategy to include wrapping their office headquarters in aluminum.

Four sons of founder Richard S. Reynolds, William G. Reynolds, Richard S. Reynolds Jr., David P. Reynolds, and J. Louis Reynolds, were all part of the running of the business. Richard S. Reynolds Jr. succeeded his father as president in 1948 and under his leadership, the company underwent a major expansion with operations extended to countries around the world such as Venezuela and the Philippines. In 1976 David P. Reynolds, also known for his involvement in Thoroughbred horse racing, took over as president. He was the last member of his family to head the company and would retire as chairman.

Reynolds Metals developed other, less well-known products; not all became commercially viable, such as an aluminum bus developed with Rohr Industries, a 12-foot aluminum utility boat, and other aluminum motor vehicles., The aluminum vehicles were surpassed in weight and cost by steel, plastics and fiberglass. However, when Reynolds Metals developed the world&#x27;s first aluminum submarine, the &quot;Aluminaut&quot;, the experimental product participated in a key rescue. In 1969, &quot;Aluminaut&quot; rescued &quot;Alvin (DSV-2)&quot;. Aluminaut&#x27;s assistance enabled Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to continue operating its submersible. Alvin&#x27;s work continues 45 years later.

By 1991, Reynolds Metals employed 30,800 workers at more than 100 operations in 20 countries, including 64 plants in the United States, and had a total production capacity of more than 1 million tons of aluminum and aluminum products. The company was acquired by Alcoa on May 3, 2000, to become the largest aluminum company in the United States.

On January 21, 2008, Alcoa sold its consumer unit to Rank Group Ltd. Rank&#x27;s owner, New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart, renamed Alcoa&#x27;s former unit the Reynolds Packaging Group. Hart merged his other packaging companies into Reynolds to create Reynolds Group Holdings.

In an initiative led by Paul D. Thomas, Reynolds Packaging Group chief executive officer and a former Alcoa executive, on September 21, 2008, Reynolds announced that one of the foil plants that produced Reynolds Wrap, in downtown Richmond, Virginia, would be closed and foil operations moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where Reynolds Wrap first was produced. A small portion of the spooling operation from the Richmond Foil plant was moved to the Reynolds plant in Grove City, Pennsylvania, in early 2010. Hart later closed five other plants within Reynolds. As a reflection of the recessionary times, salaries were frozen and salaried employees were not given pay raises. Union employees with fixed compensation contracts did receive incentive compensation. In early 2010 all pay was unfrozen. Salaried employees have since received pay adjustments.

==Headquarters==
The former Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters building is in Henrico County, Virginia, near Richmond. Built , it is a Modernist building designed by the architect Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. During its use by Reynolds, the Executive Office Building was known as Reynolds EXO. In 2000, it was named to the National Register of Historic Places, becoming one of the rare mid−20th century buildings on the list. Making extensive use of aluminum, down to threads in the carpeting, it is now owned by the University of Richmond and serves as the worldwide headquarters of Altria Group.

==Consumer products==
Reynolds Wrap was first made by a Reynolds Metals Company division, Reynolds Packaging, a business created to supply aluminum foil for packaging tobacco. When Alcoa purchased Reynolds Metals, it shed some non-metals packaging and printing businesses but preserved the Reynolds consumer brand, as well as the Reynolds Kitchens, which are still across the street from the former Reynolds headquarters building. Alcoa&#x27;s Reynolds division was a leader in household baking and cooking products, which included Cut-Rite Wax Paper.

Reynolds published cookbooks such as &quot;Outdoor Cooking with Reynolds Wrap&quot; (1950) and &quot;Casual Cooking&quot; (1954) in an attempt to promote the sales of Reynolds Wrap.

In 1958, the company launched the &quot;Designs for Giving&quot; campaign, in which professional artists and designers were hired to create special patterns for aluminum gift wrapping. Designs included &quot;Birds and Bees&quot; for baby showers, &quot;Born Lucky, Born Rich&quot; for birthdays, and &quot;Flight of Fancy&quot; for weddings or Christmas.

Reynolds Consumer Products went public with an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol REYN on Friday, January 31, 2020.

<text>John Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Cunningham III (born March 27, 1931) is an American former politician who served as a Republican U.S. Representative from Washington&#x27;s seventh district for one term from 1977 to 1979.

== Biography ==
Prior to his service in the U.S. House, Cunningham served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975, and after that in the Washington State Senate from 1975 to 1977. He served in the United States Air Force Reserve in 1953 and 1954. Cunningham lived in Des Moines, Washington.

=== Congress ===
Cunningham was elected as a Republican to the seventh district vacancy in a special election when U.S. Representative Brock Adams resigned to become Secretary of Transportation. However his victory in this liberal district was more the result of confusion with Adams&#x27;s resignation. Cunningham lost reelection in 1978, and served from May 17, 1977 – January 3, 1979.

<text>Jo-Anne Bench is a British musician from Leamington Spa, who is best known as the bassist for Bolt Thrower. She has performed on all of the band&#x27;s albums, but not on any of their demos. Noted for being one of few women in the extreme metal genre, Bench has been influential to a number of other female musicians in the genre.

Bench joined the band in 1987, shortly after Gavin Ward switched from bass guitar to guitar. At the time, she was Ward&#x27;s long-time girlfriend and notable as one of a few female members in a commercially successful metal band. Bolt Thrower were active until 2016, when they decided to disband following the death of drummer Martin Kearns the previous year.

She contributed guest vocals (spoken word) on the track &quot;Resurrected For Massive Torture&quot; by The Project Hate MCMXCIX on the 2005 album &quot;Armageddon March Eternal – Symphonies of Slit Wrists&quot;.

<doc id="1125164" wikidata="Q3573973" url="?curid=1125164" title="Bluebottle (character)">
<text>Bluebottle is a comedy character from &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, a 1950s British comedy radio show. The character was created and performed by Peter Sellers.

Bluebottle is an adenoidal squeaky-voiced Boy Scout from East Finchley (the same neighborhood of London where Peter Sellers grew up). He was noted for reading his own stage directions out loud, and was often greeted with a deliberate round of applause from the audience (&quot;Enter Bluebottle wearing string and cardboard pyjamas. Waits for audience applause. Not a sausage&quot;). As was common with &quot;Goon Show&quot; characters, Sellers&#x27; Bluebottle was paired with a Spike Milligan character, usually Eccles (the third Goon, Harry Secombe, usually stayed in his alter-ego of Neddie Seagoon throughout the show).

Bluebottle is also prone to humorous misnaming of characters, including himself. For example, he has referred to himself as &quot;Blunebottle&quot; and &quot;Blatbottle&quot; on occasion. Other characters are often misnamed as well, including &quot;Count Morinanty&quot; for Count Jim Moriarty, &quot;Robinge Hoonjie&quot; for Robin Hood and &quot;Miss Balustrade&quot; for Minnie Bannister. Neddie is always &quot;My Capitan&quot;. In &quot;The Yehti&quot; he reads his own name as &quot;Blunbintle&quot;.

According to the 1976 book &quot;The Goon Show Companion&quot;, Bluebottle was originally known as Ernie Splutmuscle. In the third series episode &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, he was cast in a small role. Seagoon strides across the ceiling of his club, hurling members to the floor. He bumps into Splutmuscle:
Four shows later, in the episode &quot;The Greatest Mountain in the World&quot;, the script refers to &quot;Peter (Bluebottle)&quot;.

Early in season 5, Bluebottle would enter with a direct appeal to the audience: &quot;Enter Bluebottle, waits for audience applause. Not a sausage&quot;. As the character became more popular, he would actually earn the applause that he sought, which he would acknowledge with a grateful, &quot;Oh! Sausinges!&quot; In later seasons, no request or response was needed: Bluebottle&#x27;s entry into the show would generate a loud, sustained applause by itself.

Bluebottle was often killed, or &quot;deaded&quot;, during the course of an episode. This would be punctuated by a lamentation such as, &quot;You rotten swine, you! You have deaded me!&quot; After a while, the character began to anticipate this fate, noting at the appearance of a dangerous prop that &quot;the dreaded deading&quot; is approaching. Bluebottle&#x27;s &quot;deading&quot; became so regular that at the close of the season 6 episode &quot;The Fear of Wages&quot;, he asks Wallace Greenslade to make a special announcement &quot;that I have not been deaded this week&quot;.

==Origin==
Bluebottle was based on Ruxton Hayward, a Scoutmaster Sellers once met. In an interview with Michael Parkinson, Sellers described trying to keep a straight face while talking with a large red-bearded Scout leader who nevertheless spoke in a falsetto voice and had an ingratiating manner. The identity of the individual was later revealed in &quot;The Goons&quot;, one of several books featuring memoirs and scripts from &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

==Cultural references==
* The character &quot;Pierre&quot; in the British animated series &quot;Count Duckula&quot; (and later a similar character on &quot;Victor and Hugo&quot;) was voiced by David Jason with a voice almost identical to Bluebottle&#x27;s.
* Geoffrey Rush (playing Peter Sellers) thanks a crowd who attended the premiere of one of the Pink Panther movies in character as Bluebottle in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;.
* Douglas Adams, in his book &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; wrote a line of dialogue for the character &quot;Marvin, the Paranoid Android&quot; that said: &quot;Nothing. Not an electronic sausage.&quot; Adams often acknowledged having been influenced by the Goons.
*John Lennon delivers a verse of the Beatles song &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)&quot; in a voice similar to that of Bluebottle.

<text>Martin Kearns (7 March 1977 – 14 September 2015) was an English drummer, specializing in death metal, known for his association with Bolt Thrower since 1994. He joined the band at age 17 after playing in several local bands in Coventry, playing anything from metal to reggae, having been playing pub gigs since the age of 14.

==Bolt Thrower==

Kearns subsequently left for personal reasons in 1998, he returned to Bolt Thrower in 2000. Martin was the longest standing drummer for Bolt Thrower. He recorded drums on both the &quot;Honour-Valour-Pride&quot; album, and on &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot;, the latter of which has been met with widespread critical acclaim from magazines such as &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, &quot;Rock Hard&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;.

==Death==
Kearns died unexpectedly at the age of 38, on 14 September 2015. The band posted on Sputnikmusic that Kearns reported breathing troubles and lightheadedness during a practice session, and, after trying to relax with a shower and nap, was found to have died peacefully in his sleep. The following year, the remaining members of Bolt Thrower eventually decided to dissolve the band rather than replace Kearns, with frontman Karl Willetts stating, &quot;I can confirm that Bolt Thrower are definitely over for good. There will be no reunion tours etc... no compromise.&quot;

<text>Gavin Ward is one of the two founding members of the now disbanded Bolt Thrower. He started out as the bass player early on in the band in 1986, and so can be heard on the first demo. For the second demo, he switched to playing guitar. He plays lead and rhythm guitar on all albums, save &quot;Mercenary&quot; and &quot;Honour - Valour - Pride&quot;; there he plays solely rhythm guitar. Ward was also one of the lyricists of the band. Bolt Thrower disbanded in 2016, a year after the death of their drummer Martin Kearns.

Before Ward started with Bolt Thrower he helped out the punk band The Varukers on one of their tours - the band later joined them on a European tour.

He is from Leamington Spa, England.

<doc id="1125175" wikidata="Q807022" url="?curid=1125175" title="Banyuls AOC">
<text>Banyuls () is a French &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) for a fortified apéritif or dessert wine made from old vines cultivated in terraces on the slopes of the Catalan Pyrenees in the Roussillon county of France, bordering, to the south, the Empordà wine region in Catalonia in Spain.

The AOC production area is limited to four communes of the Côte Vermeille: Banyuls (from which the AOC takes its name), Cerbère, Collioure and Port-Vendres. The boundaries of the AOC are identical to those of the Collioure AOC.

Banyuls Grand Cru is an AOC for superior wines that would otherwise be classified as simply Banyuls. They must be matured for 30 months. The grapes permitted are the same.

==Winemaking==

The production process, known in France as &quot;mutage&quot;, is similar to that used to make Port. Alcohol is added to the must to halt fermentation while sugar levels are still high, preserving the natural sweetness of the grape. The wines are then matured in oak barrels, or outside in glass bottles exposed to the sun, allowing the wine to maderise. The maturation period is a minimum of ten months for Banyuls AOC. The resulting wine bears a similarity to port but tends to be lower in alcohol (≈16% vs. ≈20%).

==Grapes and wines==
Most wines are red, although some white and rosé wines are produced. Permitted grape varieties are Grenache noir (at least 50%, 75% for the Grand Cru), Grenache gris, Grenache blanc and Carignan, and also (but rarely used) Macabeu, Muscat and Malvoisie.

==Producers==
Producers of note in Banyuls making traditional Banyuls wines include Domaine de la Rectorie, Domaine Vial-Magneres, Domaine du Traginer, Domaine Madeloc, and Domaine du Mas Blanc.

<text>Karl Willetts (born 21 September 1966) is an English death metal vocalist, best known as the lead singer of Bolt Thrower and Memoriam. 

==Biography==
Willetts joined the British death metal band Bolt Thrower in 1988. Before that, he drove the backline of the band. He stayed with Bolt Thrower until 1994, after the recording of &quot;...For Victory&quot;. He left the band mainly because he wanted to go back to university and finish his degree.

Willetts rejoined as a session vocalist for the recording of &quot;Mercenary&quot; and left shortly thereafter because of financial reasons and lack of commitment. In the meantime, he got a job as a salesman of insurances besides other jobs. He resides in Solihull. Rumours persisted he had returned in 2001, but he did not. However, in November 2004, he actually did re-join Bolt Thrower after the departure of Dave Ingram. Willetts now has a degree in Cultural Studies from the Birmingham University. Willetts stayed in Bolt Thrower until the band broke up in 2016, following the death of drummer Martin Kearns the year before.

Willetts also did some guest vocals with UK punk band Doom on their Peel Sessions album and UK death metal band Benediction on two accounts; one on &quot;Jumping at Shadows&quot; which appears on &quot;The Grand Leveller&quot; and &quot;Dark is the Season&quot;; the other on &quot;At the Wrong Side of the Grave&quot;, which is a cover of The Accüsed and appears on the &quot;Transcend the Rubicon&quot; album.

Willetts was a vegetarian for a long while, but started eating meat prior to 2006.

<text>Sheila Kaye-Smith (4 February 1887 – 14 January 1956) was an English writer, known for her many novels set in the borderlands of Sussex and Kent in the English regional tradition. Her 1923 book &quot;The End of the House of Alard&quot; became a best-seller, and gave her prominence; it was followed by other successes, and her books enjoyed worldwide sales.

Interest in her novel &quot;Joanna Godden&quot; (1921) was revived after it was adapted as a film titled &quot;The Loves of Joanna Godden&quot; (1947), which had a different conclusion. In the 1980s, this novel and &quot;Susan Spray&quot; were reissued by Virago press.

==Life==

The daughter of a physician and his wife, Sheila Kaye-Smith was born in St Leonards-on-Sea, near Hastings, in Sussex. She lived most of her life in that county, apart from a period in London in her youth. She was a distant relative of writer M. M. Kaye (&quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;).

In 1924 Kaye-Smith married Theodore Penrose Fry, an Anglican clergyman. The following year she published a book on Anglo-Catholicism. By 1929 she and her husband had converted to the Roman Catholic Church. Penrose Fry had to give up his Anglican curacy, and they moved to Northiam in Sussex, where they lived in a large converted oast house.

Soon afterwards, having noted their own and some of their neighbours&#x27; need for a nearby church, they bought land on which they established a Catholic chapel dedicated to St Theresa of Lisieux, at Northiam. It still has a large congregation. Kaye-Smith is buried in the churchyard there.

Their house, Little Doucegrove, was later owned by novelist Rumer Godden, another writer who had converted to Catholicism.

A new biography of Kaye-Smith by Shaun Cooper, &quot;The Shining Cord&quot;, was published by Country Books in June 2017.

==Writing==
Kaye-Smith&#x27;s fiction was noted for being rooted in rural concerns: the nineteenth-century agricultural depression, farming, legacies, land rents, strikes, the changing position of women, and the effects of industrialisation on the countryside and provincial life. Admirers of her work included her close friend G. B. Stern. They collaborated on two books about authors Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, and Noël Coward.

Kaye-Smith&#x27;s novels encompassed more than one genre of fiction. Her earliest novels partly fit into the &#x27;earthy&#x27; rural category, together with those of Mary E Mann, Mary Webb, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Hardy. This genre inspired Stella Gibbons&#x27;s parody &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1932).

Kaye-Smith&#x27;s response to the latter was amusement: she placed a good-natured riposte in her novel &quot;A Valiant Woman&quot; (1939), set in a rapidly modernising village undergoing some gentrification. (Pearce, 2008). A subplot has an upper middle-class teenager, Lucia, turn from writing twee rural poems to undertake the great Urban Proletarian Novel: &quot;… all about people who aren&#x27;t married going to bed in a Manchester slum and talking about the Means Test.&quot; Her philistine grandmother is dismayed, as she prefers cosy rural novels and knows Lucia is ignorant of proletarian life: 

That silly child! Did she really think she could write a novel? Well, of course, modern novels might encourage her to think so. There was nothing written nowadays worth reading. The book on her knee was called Cold Comfort Farm and had been written by a young woman who was said to be very clever and had won an important literary prize. But she couldn&#x27;t get on with it at all. It was about life on a farm, but the girl obviously knew nothing about country life. To anyone who, like herself, had always lived in the country, the whole thing was too ridiculous and impossible for words.
Kaye-Smith&#x27;s descriptions of the Sussex countryside, coast and marsh are still regarded as some of the finest. Several of her heroines are single parents and most face various gender-related trials, reflecting her early feminism as well as influences such as George Moore and Thomas Hardy (Pearce, 2004). Kaye-Smith also produced many short stories, and her journalism was published in national journals, magazines and newspapers.

&quot;Joanna Godden&quot; (1921), arguably Kaye-Smith&#x27;s most famous novel, was set in Romney Marsh. More than two decades later, a film adaptation was made, released in 1947 as &quot;The Loves of Joanna Godden.&quot; Starring Googie Withers, it had a score by noted composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. The screenplay by H. E. Bates includes however a very different conclusion to the story.

Kaye-Smith&#x27;s later books increasingly reflected her personal religious preoccupations, featuring characters tussling with spiritual crises and conversions within subtle discussions of the differences among Anglicanism, Anglo-Catholicism, and Catholicism. Her plots (e.g. in &quot;The Lardners and the Laurelwoods&quot;, &quot;A Valiant Woman&quot;, and &quot;Mrs Gailey&quot;) continued to reflect pre- and post-WW2 preoccupations of women&#x27;s &quot;middle-brow&quot; fiction of the time. She explored national anxieties about social class, divorce, and women&#x27;s &quot;role&quot;, within a mainly rural but rapidly modernising milieu (Pearce, 2004, 2005). Her books share similarities with contemporary writers such as Barbara Pym, Marghanita Laski and H. E. Bates. Her descriptions of farming practices and economics, and village vernacular, are noted as particularly detailed and accurate for this genre (Cavalliero, 1977).

&quot;Joanna Godden&quot; and &quot;Susan Spray&quot; were reissued in the 1980s by feminist publishing house Virago. Since then her books are out of print, but are readily available on the used book market.

==Literary society==
The Sheila Kaye-Smith literary society is based in St Leonards-on-Sea, meets regularly, and has published a chronology of her life and works, as well producing an annual journal, &quot;The Gleam&quot;. There are extensive archives relating to Sheila Kaye-Smith in West Sussex County Library in Chichester.

<text>VIVIsectVI (pronounced &quot;vivisect six&quot;) is the fourth studio album by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy. It was released on September 12, 1988, through Nettwerk. Despite tackling controversial topics like animal rights, chemical warfare, and environmental waste, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; was well-received. It spawned two singles, &quot;Censor&quot;, which was released on the album as &quot;Dogshit&quot;, and &quot;Testure&quot;, which was Skinny Puppy&#x27;s only song to chart on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance Club Songs. &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; was followed by a theatrically involved tour with Nine Inch Nails as the opening act.

The album saw a refinement of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s characteristically harsh, mechanical, and sample-heavy sound, with several critics labeling it as the band&#x27;s best effort. Since its release, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; has garnered critical acclaim and recognition as a landmark release in industrial and electronic music.

==Background==
After Skinny Puppy&#x27;s first two releases on a label, &quot;Remission&quot; (1984) and &quot;Bites&quot; (1985), the band began to hone its messages and focus on social wrongs. 1986&#x27;s &quot;&quot; saw Dwayne Goettel&#x27;s introduction into the group and marked a shift in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s sound from dark synth-pop to a more elaborate form of abrasive industrial music. This evolution was furthered on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot; when Skinny Puppy started to experiment with ambience and atmosphere. Dave Ogilvie, who had produced some of the group&#x27;s previous albums, joined as a full-time member, and work on &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; began at Mushroom Studios, Vancouver in mid-1988. The lyrical and thematic elements of the music were refined and made more of a focus on the album; whereas before the music&#x27;s message was oblique, on &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; it became more direct.

Growing up, Skinny Puppy&#x27;s vocalist, Nivek Ogre, believed that animal experimentation was necessary. After researching the topic, he became more and more disgusted, eventually reaching the point where he was against all forms of animal testing. To compound this disillusionment, in 1983, Ogre&#x27;s father died and a record distribution company that was set to support one of his early projects dissolved. In the resultant lurch, he wrote a song called &quot;K-9&quot; about the world seen through a dog&#x27;s eyes. &quot;K-9&quot; became the first Skinny Puppy song and appeared on the group&#x27;s debut release, &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; (1984). As the band further developed, the idea of life from an animal&#x27;s perspective continued to come to mind, and &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; especially showcased the concept. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, is a pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism via the roman numerals for 666 coupled with the word &quot;sect&quot;. It is pronounced &quot;vivisect six&quot;.

==Composition and content==
Musically, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; is an electronic industrial album that is characterized by chaos, repetitive loops, and layers. The music, described as &quot;manic&quot; and &quot;dense&quot;, presents a sonic wall that is difficult to penetrate upon initial listening. The band emphasizes programmed drum machine loops and rhythms which are augmented by the production to sound overpoweringly mechanical. On the liner notes, a message reads, &quot;Play this music loud or not at all&quot;. Ogre&#x27;s vocals range from low, indiscernible moans to screams and shrieks. AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano noted that Ogre was one of the few vocalists in the industrial genre whose voice &quot;sounded poetic amongst the noise and beats&quot;. &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; is characterized by its profusion of sounds and noises, often perceived as conflicting or cacophonous, but, as Torreano writes, it never becomes overbearing. Along with all the intensely overwhelming washes of noise, the album incorporates grooves and dance music moments.

&quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; begins with &quot;Dogshit&quot;, a song that would go on to become one of the album&#x27;s two 12-inch singles under the title &quot;Censor&quot;. Alongside Ogre&#x27;s shouted, enigmatic vocals and the loud industrial sounds, a fretless bass leads the song&#x27;s groove and eventually gives way to one of the band&#x27;s rare early instances of electric guitar. Following that is &quot;VX Gas Attack&quot;, which starts with a protracted newscast punctuated by stilted drum machine beats and occasional samples. The rest of the song continues to criticize the employment of chemical weapons and is built around a repeating percussion loop broken up with further news sound bites and occasional bass. The album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Harsh Stone White&quot;, is slow and &quot;brooding&quot;. It focuses on drug addiction, which would be the cause of Goettel&#x27;s death in 1995. Despite the song&#x27;s gloomy atmosphere and topic, the synthesized electronics are bright and comparatively optimistic. This contrast between traditionally upbeat, occasionally beautiful sounds and an oppressively industrial tone is an ongoing motif in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s music, further heightened by the variety in Ogre&#x27;s vocals, which go from agonized to manic often in the same song.

The album&#x27;s fourth track, &quot;Human Disease (S.K.U.M.M.)&quot;, is another song built around and dominated by artificial percussion. Halfway through, the song undergoes a drastic shift from breakneck drum loops to a greater emphasis on electronics and samples. Extremely distorted guitars are employed in the latter section. The track that follows, &quot;Who&#x27;s Laughing Now&quot;, was described by AllMusic as &quot;one of the true classic industrial songs of any era&quot; and was included on the soundtrack of the 1990 film &quot;Bad Influence&quot;. &quot;Testure&quot;, &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; sixth song, was the album&#x27;s second and more successful single. Labeled a dance music track, it features extensive use of smooth electronics and bass. Even though &quot;Testure&quot; is a bleak track about the violation of animal rights, it acts as a sonic rest from the album&#x27;s preceding and succeeding assault. The closing lyrics of &quot;Testure&quot; include the album&#x27;s title, pronounced as &quot;vivisect six&quot;. The seventh and eighth tracks, &quot;State Aid&quot; and &quot;Hospital Waste&quot;, return to &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; harsh nature, with the former ending in the album&#x27;s heaviest barrage of beats and the latter being built around a propulsive rhythm punctuated with bass and suffused with wailing, superimposed synth patches. &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; conclusion, &quot;Fritter (Stella&#x27;s Home)&quot;, begins as dark ambient and ends with an intense rush of machine-like drumming.

The CD version of &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; contains an otherwise unreleased track, &quot;Funguss&quot;, and three additional songs that are featured on the album&#x27;s singles as b-sides. Cofounding member cEvin Key considered these appended songs as a cross between Skinny Puppy&#x27;s style and that of some of his side projects, like Doubting Thomas. A version of &quot;Punk in Park Zoo&#x27;s&quot; is featured on &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; CD release, ending with a cartoonish pitch-shifting effect that is not featured on the version found on the &quot;Censor&quot; single. &quot;Yes He Ran&quot;, the album&#x27;s longest song, and &quot;The Second Opinion&quot; further develop the industrial and sampling experimentation. The latter began as a live jam titled &quot;Snub&quot; and was later refined in studio. &quot;Funguss&quot; closes the expanded album, ending with a distorted and downtuned guitar riff reminiscent of those found commonly in heavy metal music. Skinny Puppy&#x27;s next album, &quot;Rabies&quot; (1989), would go further with that metal sound. This direction proved troubling for Key; in a 1991 interview, he said, &quot;we felt that we could come back in and really concentrate on doing a follow-up album to the last real Skinny Puppy album, which was &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, and that to us is &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;. &quot;Rabies&quot; was more of a departure.&quot;

===Samples===
Like most Skinny Puppy releases, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; employs a large number of samples, many of which come from horror films. &quot;Testure&quot; features several audio clips from Martin Rosen&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;. &quot;Fritter (Stella&#x27;s Home)&quot; hinges on dialogue from &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976) by Roman Polanski, and the song&#x27;s name makes reference to a character from the film, Stella, played by French actress Isabelle Adjani. The track concludes with a clip of Jack Nicholson&#x27;s voice from &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) by Stanley Kubrick. &quot;Who&#x27;s Laughing Now&quot; both contains and is titled after dialogue from Sam Raimi&#x27;s 1987 movie &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. &quot;The Second Opinion&quot; includes the line &quot;that machine has got to be destroyed&quot; from Stuart Gordon&#x27;s 1986 adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;From Beyond&quot;, and also features the &quot;man of the shroud&quot; sample first used in the closing track &quot;Epilogue&quot; from Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;Cleanse Fold and Manipulate&quot;. Politically notable, &quot;State Aid&quot; contains many samples from speeches by American president Ronald Reagan talking about AIDS.

===Themes and lyrics===
Thematically, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; focuses on animal rights, animal experimentation, the AIDS epidemic, and damage to the environment. It was the first of Skinny Puppy&#x27;s albums to be outspokenly political, which would become the norm for the band. &quot;VX Gas Attack&quot; denounces chemical weapons by framing the song in the Iran–Iraq War. &quot;Testure&quot;, a lyrically blatant song, brings vivisection into the forefront. About the album&#x27;s themes, Ogre said that the point of &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; &quot;was to give an animal human qualities and show people how a human would react if they were in the same position.&quot; He continued, saying, &quot;Hopefully it will keep going from there. If we can get that in there, have people taking the info and responding to it, without thinking about it, that&#x27;s the whole point.&quot; Simon Reynolds of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; thought Skinny Puppy&#x27;s approach to difficult topics (that is, facing trauma by mimicking that trauma) was the band&#x27;s most intriguing quality. He praised &quot;the tension between glamourisation and vilification, sadism and empathy&quot; found in &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; sound and live performances.

These topic are conveyed through Ogre&#x27;s guttural and cryptic vocals. Though his contributions are abrasive and occasionally screamed, Ogre&#x27;s work on &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; saw him challenging himself to layer more complexity and harmonies into the music. The vocals are fast-paced, distorted, and difficult to actively absorb, often coming in the form of fragmented streams of consciousness. Despite the lyrical obscurity and harsh delivery, the album&#x27;s messages remain at the core of Ogre&#x27;s efforts.

==Artwork==
Steven R. Gilmore, longtime Skinny Puppy collaborator, created the artwork for &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;. The cover, which depicts a mangled blue hand against a black background, comprises a collage of X-ray photography. Gilmore&#x27;s friend who worked at the University of British Columbia provided him with a stack of X-ray images bound for disposal, and, with a makeshift light table, he made &quot;VIVIsectVI&#x27;s&quot; artwork. In 1988 when the artwork was created, it was common practice to use large format Hasselblad cameras to take black and white Polaroid test shots of the piece to verify exposure. In 2012, Gilmore said that it was his favorite cover that he had done for the band. According to Gilmore, the sleeve was designed for the gatefold format, but less than a thousand of those were printed. The distorted photograph of the band that appears on the liner notes was taken by Kevin Westenberg.

==Live performances==


&quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; was followed by a tour of North America that featured Nine Inch Nails, a band inspired by Skinny Puppy, as the opening act. Despite being a full member of the band, Ogilvie was not a part of the live performances. Instead, Skinny Puppy toured as a trio, with Ogre on vocals, Goettel on percussion, and Key performing synthesizers. During live shows, Ogre portrayed a vivisectionist who in turn became the test subject. The concerts were noted for being shocking and violent, with horrifying visuals playing in the background and Ogre acting as a madman on stage.

On October 22, 1988, at Saint Andrew&#x27;s Hall, Detroit, one of the band&#x27;s props, Chud (a custom-made stuffed dog fixed with an armature), was stolen by a female fan who went backstage after the concert. Using information provided by another attendee, Key and Ogre managed to locate the woman&#x27;s address and drive to her home. After retrieving Chud from the back of a parked car, Key and Ogre explained the situation to the fan&#x27;s parents, who thanked them for not calling the police. Additional drama with Chud occurred a day later on October 23, 1988 during a performance in Cincinnati when two members of the crowd believed that the stuffed dog that Ogre was vivisecting was real and called the police. A pair of plainclothes detectives went backstage and accosted the band without providing any identification. Even after it became evident that no animal was harmed during the concert, the band, charged with disorderly conduct, was arrested and jailed. After a night spent incarcerated, the band was released and fined $200. According to Ogre, it was ironic to be detained for mimicking vivisection when, across the street from the concert hall (Bogart&#x27;s), was a genuine animal testing laboratory. He later gave an official statement on the encounter: &quot;I find it paradoxical that the police can justify arresting us on the assumption that we mutilate and experiment on live animals for a theatrical performance when the inhuman reality is that it occurs in over 300 laboratories every day.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; was released worldwide in September 1988. The first several hundred copies released in Canada were in full-color gatefold sleeves; later Canadian pressings as well as all pressings released in the United States were distributed either as non-gatefold vinyl or as CDs in jewel cases. This was the first Skinny Puppy release to contain a picture of the band and was the only to list Ogilvie as an official member.

The album was supported by two singles, &quot;Censor&quot; (titled &quot;Dogshit&quot; on the album) and &quot;Testure&quot;. &quot;Dogshit&#x27;s&quot; name change was suggested by Nettwerk but was ultimately the band&#x27;s choice, coming from a decision that the single would not sell well if it had kept the original name. &quot;Testure&quot;, released as a single in 1989, was accompanied by a music video that depicted a man (who presumably had been abusing his pet dog) being experimented on by a group of surgeons. According to Ogre and Key, the video was pulled from airplay following an internal poll by Citytv, an associate of Canada&#x27;s MuchMusic. The poll came out nearly split, but, regardless, the video was ultimately banned by &quot;the powers that be&quot;. Irrespective of the video&#x27;s ban, &quot;Testure&quot; reached number 19 on &quot;Billboards&#x27;s&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

===Critical reception===

Upon release in 1988, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; was well-received but generally overshadowed by Skinny Puppy&#x27;s onstage antics. In his 1988 review, Mark Jenkins of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote that the album contained the band&#x27;s &quot;most morose music yet&quot; and commented that the song &quot;Testure&quot; was &quot;characteristically impressionistic but lucidly visceral&quot;. In 1989, Jim Aikin of &quot;Keyboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Somehow, in the midst of the painful audio chaos, the fun comes across.&quot; Since then, critical acclaim has grown, with several publications recognizing the album as important to the industrial and electronic genres. Bradley Torreano of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s variety and called it &quot;one of their true masterpieces&quot;. Another AllMusic writer, Jim Harper, believed that &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; led to Skinny Puppy being the &quot;originator of a new musical style.&quot; &quot;See Magazine&quot; said that the album &quot;marks a pinnacle in the band&#x27;s career, at which they weren&#x27;t merely peaking as musicians but also as friends,&quot; and that it was their &quot;most focused recording&quot;. Writing for &quot;LA Weekly&quot; in 2017, Brett Callwood agreed with Harper by calling the album &quot;genre-defining&quot; and said, &quot;The early Puppy albums are fantastic and important, but by the fourth, 1988’s &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;, the group had really hit their stride.&quot; Callwood continued, praising the album&#x27;s percussion effects as genuinely and frighteningly mechanical. In 2012, Chris Morgan of &quot;Treble&quot; labeled &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; as one of the essential industrial albums, saying that the album &quot;is not just mean and abrasive, but vile and scabrous, giving new meaning to the term &#x27;infectious,&#x27; when it comes to electronic music.&quot; In 2021, Polish writer Jacek Szafranowicz described Skinny Puppy as at its best on &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;.

<text>David Richard Bjerregaard Ingram (born 25 January 1969) is a death metal vocalist from Birmingham, England. He began his career replacing Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway in UK death metal band Benediction when Greenway decided to focus solely on Napalm Death. Ingram stayed with Benediction until March 1998, when he joined Bolt Thrower, officially replacing Martin van Drunen after having handled vocals temporarily for the band during a show on 4 July 1997 in Zwickau Germany.

In 2004, Ingram left Bolt Thrower due to health problems, just prior to the recording of &quot;Those Once Loyal&quot;. He later performed vocals on an album by Warlord UK and sang in his own band Downlord until the band disbanded in 2008. Later that same year, he began Metal Breakfast Radio, an online metal show that reviews new music from underground bands in a unique and somewhat humorous manner. Ingram&#x27;s own website can be found at www.darksentinel.dk

In a departure from his metal roots, Ingram launched a big band jazz and swing themed online streaming radio program called &quot;Lambert&#x27;s Basement&quot;. The title of the show is a tribute to his father Lawrence Albert Lambert Ingram.

The post-Downlord period saw Ingram involved in a number of other bands and projects. His collaboration with Rogga Johansson lead to the bands Down Among The Dead Men and Echelon.

In late 2015, Ingram was announced as the new vocalist for Dutch death metal band Hail of Bullets in anticipation of their appearance at Maryland Deathfest in May 2016. At the conclusion of the band&#x27;s set, Hail of Bullets guitarist Stephan Gebédi announced Ingram had joined the band on a permanent basis. (In an odd coincidence, Ingram was again replacing van Drunen). The band announced their disbandment in March 2017.

In July 2019, Benediction announced Ingram had rejoined the band, following Dave Hunt&#x27;s departure. The first album with Ingram, &quot;Scriptures&quot;, was released 16 October 2020.

<text>Kapóng is a Cariban language spoken mainly in Guyana, most commonly in the region of the Upper Mazaruni. Though many speakers do not live in villages, there are a number of population centers, notably Kamarang, Jawalla, Waramadong, and Kako. There are two dialects, Akawaio and Patamona.

The Macushi name of the language is &quot;Ingarikó&quot;.

== History ==
The Carib tribes practice an indigenous system of beliefs, one that dates back to the 16th century. It was not until the 19th century that attempts were made to understand the beliefs and practices of this tribe. Much of the Kapóng language refers back to sun worship and sun spirits, which is reflective of the beliefs system of these Carib-speaking tribes. Literature has also found belief in a higher being in the sky among the Carib tribes in Guyana.

==Geographic distribution==
The Kapóng language is found to be spoken in lowland tropical South America, particularly in the countries of Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela. 

In Guyana, Kapóng is spoken in forests by the Mazaruni River Basin. In 2013, a survey by the Inter-American Development Bank identified 20% fluency among Akawaio, which was the highest fluency rate among all sampled indigenous groups in Guyana. However, no indigenous language was in use by the Guyanese Patamona people in the survey.

The number of speakers in Brazil is about 10,000, and the transmission of language in Brazil is deemed to be of good standing. Speakers in Brazil are found in the Roraima Indigenous Terra Raposa. 

In Venezuela, Kapóng is spoken in the states of Bolivar and Monagas. 

==Dialects/Varieties==
Kapóng has three dialects, which are:
* Akawaio (Akawayo)
* Ingarikó (Ingaricó)
* Patamona

==Morphology==
&quot;yamok&quot; (aemvk) is an ending used to make words plural. (i.e.) Adding &quot;yamok&quot; to &quot;Kapong&quot; makes &quot;Kapong&quot; plural; &quot;Kapong yamok&quot;.

-&quot;da&quot; is a marker used to mark possession. (i.e.) &quot;kaata&quot; = book; &quot;da kaata&quot; = my book.

The preferred word order of Kapóng is subject-object-verb, for example:

However, the word order is flexible and there are cases where the object precedes the subject in sentences. Such as:

There are no gender distinctions found in Kapóng, as there are no differences in personal pronoun systems and affixes to indicate genders of nouns.

Similes are often used in writing, as many words in this language allow this to occur. Through the use of suffixes, many words can be converted into similes. Examples are as follows:
* &quot;-kasa&quot; = &#x27;like&#x27;
* &quot;-walai&quot; = &#x27;similar to&#x27;

== Vocabulary ==
Much of the Kapóng language has emphasis on a higher spirit/god up in the sky, and this is reflected in the vocabulary in this language.

* &quot;Kapóng&quot; = Sky People
* &quot;akwalo&quot; = the spirit
* &quot;akwa&quot; = God&#x27;s place
* &quot;Waica&quot; = warrior
* &quot;Taemogoli&quot; = grandfather
* &quot;Kapo&quot; = in the sky
* &quot;Iopotari akuru&quot; = chief spirit

<doc id="1125203" wikidata="Q6918258" url="?curid=1125203" title="Motorcycle boot">
<text>Motorcycle boots are associated with motorcycle riders and range from above ankle to below knee boots. They have an outside of a typical boot but a low heel to control the motorcycle.
To improve motorcycle safety, motorcycle boots are generally made from a thick, heavy leather and may include energy absorbing and load spreading padding, metal, plastic and/or composite materials to protect the motorcycle rider&#x27;s feet, ankles and legs in an accident. For use in wet weather, some boots have a waterproof membrane lining such as Gore-Tex or SympaTex.

Depending upon how form-fitting the boot is, to allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft may be designed to open lengthwise. If so, Velcro or another hook and loop fastener is typically used on the inner sides of the opening to allow the rider to close the boot over the foot, ankle, and leg. This allows for some flexibility for the rider to control the boot&#x27;s tightness. Some manufacturers also include an internal quick-lacing system between a soft inner leg and the harder outer shell of the boot shaft to further ensure a tight, but comfortable fit. The heel of a racing boot is typically very low: not more than 1/2-inch (13 mm), and sole of the heel and foot is typically rather smooth. A curved plastic or composite plate may be included to cover the shin of the boot to protect the rider&#x27;s shin.

==Protection from injury==
Lateef (2002) found: &quot;Lower limb injuries represent the commonest form of injury among motorcyclists involved in [road traffic accidents].&quot; Subsequently, Kortor &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) also established that: &quot;Lower limb injuries represent the commonest form of injuries among the motorcycle accident victims. Fractures were the commonest type of injury seen and the most common location was shaft of tibia.&quot; And an earlier study at UCLA found: “Lower extremity injuries are among the most common injuries sustained by motorcycle riders in crashes and often lead to extended and costly medical treatment and permanent disability.”

Regarding injury risk reduction, University of Lyon research found: &quot;knee-high or ankle boots [...] reduced foot and ankle fracture risk.&quot;

==Racing boots==
Similar to touring boots, racing boots are designed for riding a motorcycle on hard pavement (either the street or a race track) and are usually between 10 and 14 inches in height and made from a combination of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a form-fitting, but comfortable boot. The amount of armored protection provided by racing boots is usually greater than touring boots due to the increased potential for injury at the high speeds needed for racing. Typical protection areas are reinforced to protect the shin, instep, ankle (medial and lateral) heel and toes. Often a high-wear pad of metal or composite is attached to the lateral side (outside) of the toe, as this area can contact the ground during extreme cornering. The optimum racing boot has the necessary protection for impact and abrasion while maintaining excellent single-axis flexibility at the ankle between the boot lower and the shaft; for shifting and braking. 

Styles vary between &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; boots. Some types are meant to be worn over the trouser leg. Others, such as Dainese boots for MotoGP, are designed to be worn inside the trouser leg.

==Touring / street boots==

Similar to racing boots, touring boots are designed specifically for riding a motorcycle on hard pavement, but with less armored protection than racing boots since they are intended for riders that typically ride on city streets and highways, not race tracks. They are usually between 10 and 14 inches in height and made from a combination of leather, metal, hard rubber, plastic and/or man-made fabrics to create a form-fitting, but comfortable boot.

==Motocross boots==
Motocross boots are designed specifically for off-road, motocross (MX) or all-terrain vehicle riding. To help prevent a rider&#x27;s feet and legs from being injured, motocross boots are typically much stiffer than regular motorcycle boots or racing boots, but are more flexible than ski boots by comparison.

Modern motocross boots are usually nearly knee-high (about 16 inches in height) and made from a combination of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a very form-fitting, comfortable and tight boot. To allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft of a motocross boot is designed to open lengthwise. Multiple adjustable straps (usually 3 to 4) are deployed along the foot, ankle and shaft of the boot to allow the rider to tighten the boot to their preferences and comfort. A curved plastic or composite plate covers the shin of the boot to protect the rider from debris that may be thrown from the front wheel of the motorcycle.

==Police boots==
Motorcycle police boots are designed specifically to be worn by motorcycle police officers. Very similar to riding boots, motorcycle police boots are typically knee-high (between 18 and 21 inches in height), the foot and shaft are made from black, smooth-grained, high-gloss leather and the low-heeled sole is made from hard rubber. The boots are typically form-fitting and intended to be worn over breeches or jodhpurs as part of the officer&#x27;s uniform. The most notable manufacturers for boots to the UK police force are Goldtop (pre 1980s), and Alt-berg (post 1980s).

==Engineer boots==

Engineer boots are a long-established style of boots used by people in a number of occupations in addition to motorcyclists.

==Harness boots==
Harness boots are very similar to engineer boots. The boots are most often made of heavy weight leather and range in height from short (10 inches) to extra high (38 inches). The most typical height is between 10 and 18 inches. The most common color is black, but brown harness boots are also made.

Harness boots are designed to protect the motorcycle rider from the heat of the exhaust pipes and the engine block and from injury to the foot and leg in the case of an accident while riding and may include a built-in steel toe cap and metal shank in the heel. Whereas engineer boots have a rounded toe, harness boots typically have a square toe. Unlike engineer boots that have an adjustable leather strap across the ankle, harness boots have a non-adjustable system of four leather straps and two metal rings: one strap goes across the top of the foot at the ankle, one strap wraps around the rear of the foot at the ankle and two more straps rise from sole on either side ankle. The four straps are held in place by the two metal rings that are located on either side of the ankle. Typically, these boots possess a pair of pull-straps on either side of the tops of the shafts. Some manufacturers replace these straps with an adjustable leather strap located on the outside top of the shafts, similar to engineer boots. Soles and heels are usually made of hard rubber and may either be relatively flat or may have lugs for increased traction.

Harness boots were originally modeled on the square toed boots prevalent in the 19th century, including those worn by American Civil War soldiers. Leather straps and rings were added to this style in the 1960s, creating the modern version of the harness boot, which quickly became a classic.

==CE certification of motorcycle footwear==

===Minimum tests===
There is a European standard available for motorcycle boots, and it is a legal requirement in Europe and the UK for these boots to be CE certified. This EN13634 standard is titled &quot;Protective footwear for motorcycle riders – Requirements and test methods&quot;. It is a European harmonized standard published throughout Europe and in the UK by BSI. It tests them for resistance to abrasion, penetration by sharp objects and lateral crushing. The label consists of a motorcycle icon, the designation of the test they&#x27;ve passed and then a series of four numbers. The more &#x27;2&#x27;s on the CE label, the more protective the boot. 

These numbers will be either a &#x27;1&#x27; for a Level 1 pass (lower protection) or a &#x27;2&#x27; for a Level 2 pass (higher protection). From the left, the numbers correspond to: the boots&#x27; Height, its Abrasion Resistance, its Impact Cut resistance, and its Traverse Rigidity. For Height, 1 is short, and 2 is tall. For other categories, 1 denotes rudimentary protection, while 2 indicates better protection.

====Abrasion resistance====
The abrasion resistance test is designed to check how well boots will prevent injury from abrasion. For testing, the boot is divided into two areas – Area A covers the sole, front and back of the boot, where you&#x27;re most likely to find stretch panels, and everything else is Area B. Three samples of material are cut from the boot, and each is held against a moving abrasive belt until a hole appears. The shortest time it took for a hole to develop in one of the samples dictates the boot&#x27;s abrasion rating. For basic Level 1 approval, samples cut from area A must last 1.5 seconds, and samples from area B need to last five seconds. To reach the higher Level 2, area A samples need to last 2.5 seconds or longer, while area B must survive at least 12 seconds without wearing through.

====Impact cut====
Next, the boots are tested to see how they’d hold up if they came up against a sharp object. For this, a blade attached to a mounting block is dropped onto a sample of the boot; apparatus measures how far the blade goes through the boot. The tests use the same areas as the abrasion test (see above) and the blade is dropped at different speeds to test each area. When testing area A, the knife will be dropped at two metres per second (m/s). For a Level 1 and a Level 2 rating, the knife can&#x27;t protrude through the material by more than 25mm. Area B is tested by dropping the blade at 2.8m/s. For Level 1 approval, the blade can&#x27;t go through the sample by more than 25mm. To pass Level 2, the maximum it can go through is 15mm.

====Transverse rigidity====
The transverse rigidity test determines how strongly the boot can resist your foot being crushed if a bike&#x27;s weight fell on it. The boot is laid down with the widest part of the foot positioned between two plates. These plates squash together at a rate of 30mm per min. Apparatus records the force required to compress the sole at that rate. The machine is turned off when the plates stop squeezing the sole, when the force is clearly remaining constant or when the sole has been crushed by 20mm. This test is repeated three times. If it took less than 1kN of force to compress the sole to 20mm, the boot fails. If it took 1kN-1.4kN the boot takes a Level 1 pass and if it needed 1.5kN or more to compress the sole it achieves a Level 2 pass.

===Optional additional tests===
Manufacturers can submit their boots for six optional extra tests. Motorcycle News noted that &quot;Manufacturers can also request that their boots are subjected to additional tests in order to receive further accreditation.&quot; These tests include &#x27;IPA&#x27; for ankle or shin protection, &#x27;WR&#x27; for water resistance or &#x27;WAD&#x27; for the displacement of water from inside. Passes in these tests will be represented on the label with letters underneath the mandatory test ratings.

IPA/IPS – Impact protection to the ankle and/or shin:
These show boots with approved impact protection. For this test, the boot is cut along the sole and opened up; a striker is used to drop 10 joules of force onto the protector. To pass this test, the protector can&#x27;t allow more than 5kN to be transmitted through it. If the ankle protection passes, the letters IPA will be on the label, and shin armour will be displayed as IPS.

WR – Resistance to water penetration:
Boots that claim to be water resistant should be tested in one of two ways. They can be clamped to a machine with the toes flexing to replicate 4600 steps while the foot is submerged in water, or a person can wear the boot and walk 1km (100 x 10-metre lengths) in shallow water. To pass in either method, areas of dampness inside the boot can be no bigger than 3cm².

FO – Resistance to fuel and oil on sole:
Two samples of a boot are weighed twice – once normally and once in distilled water. The sample is then left soaking in fuel at 23 degrees for 22 hours, taken out and weighed in the same ways again. To pass, the weight of the samples shouldn&#x27;t increase by more than 12%.

SRA/SRB/SRC – Slip-resistance of sole:
Three tests make up the one rating for slip resistance. Each test is done with a mechanical heel set at a seven-degree angle, which moves to imitate different kinds of slips and falls on different surfaces. If the label shows ‘SRA’, the sole will have passed on a ceramic tile surface treated with diluted soap. ‘SRB’ means it passed on a steel floor treated with glycerol. ‘SRC’ means the boot passed both tests.

B – Breathability of uppers:
If a CE label has the letter B on it, it means the boot has gone through an optional test to check that moisture vapour can escape.

WR – Water absorption/desorption of inner:
The boots are tested to see how much water the insides hold and how much they release. If the boots pass this test, ‘WAD’ will be displayed on the label.

<doc id="1125204" wikidata="Q6965390" url="?curid=1125204" title="Narara, New South Wales">
<text>Narara () is a suburb just north of Gosford on the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. It is part of the local government area.

The suburb is mostly residential but also holds Narara railway station on the Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line. It also contains a number of parks, sporting grounds, and a concrete public skatepark. It is the home of Narara Valley High School, a NSW government public high school, and St Philips Christian College Gosford, a private school educating children from kindergarten to year twelve.

It is also home to the Narara Ecovillage, which aims to research, design and build a stylish, intergenerational, friendly demonstration Ecovillage, blending the principles of ecological and social sustainability, good health, business, caring and other options that can evolve from our well-being. Narara also hosts the annual Ecoburbia festival, awarded Best Community Event by Gosford City Council in 2015.

The name &#x27;Narara&#x27; can be traced back to the local Aboriginal term for &#x27;black snake&#x27;, which appears on the official emblem of Narara Valley High School and the scarf of 1st Narara Scout Group.

The Narara Music Festival was held nearby in Somersby in 1983 and 1984. The Angels, an Australian rock band, produced a live album recorded at the festival, &quot;Live at Narara&quot;.

Narara largely consisted of orchards and small mixed farms. Water from the small dams that used to be accessible from Narara Creek Road was piped in wooden piping across Narara Creek to the Railway station to supply steam trains. The dams were also a popular swimming spot especially when the ladder and walkway still existed on the lower dam wall.

Narara is home to the Central Coast Miniature Railway.

==History==
Narara sits in the traditional lands of the Darkinjung people, whose name of the area means &quot;black snake&quot;.

In the early 19th century, the arrival of British settlers dramatically changed the landscape and lifestyle of the Darkinjung people as they engaged in agriculture. In the mid-1800s, the Central Coast region experienced a slow development, as farms and industries were established. Narara, in its proximity to the Pacific coast, was initially valued for its agricultural drive, and the area took shape as part of the wide Central Coast development.

Narara grew into a residential suburb in the 20th century, following the arrival of the railway in the region. The Main North line reached through Narara in 1887, facilitating easier access to Sydney and the surrounding regions, bringing more people to the area and spurring residential development.

In the mid-20th century, Narara transformed from a rural farming community to a more suburban area as urbanization spread across the Central Coast. Housing estates and infrastructure projects were established, and Narara&#x27;s population grew. As it was more connected to the rest of the Central Coast and to Sydney, Narara became an increasingly popular area for families and retirees seeking a quieter, more suburban lifestyle.

<text>Hip boots, or hip [[waders (footwear)|waders]] as they are sometimes called, are a type of tall boot initially designed to be worn by river fishermen. Hip boots are typically made of rubber, they may also be made of PVC, nylon and/or polyester. Other materials, such as wool, cotton and foam, are used to add warmth and comfort. The boots completely cover the legs, up to the tops of the thighs or all the way up to the waist. Hip boots are designed to protect the wearer from water, and allow wading out into deeper waters. They also help to keep the feet and legs warm. 

Hip boots are also worn by many ecologists, environmental scientists, and aquatic biologists who do tests in swamps or lakes to determine the quality of water.

Hip boots are necessary footwear during flooding.

<text>Collioure () is an Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for French wines situated around the town of Collioure in the Roussillon wine region of France. Red, rosé and a few white wines are produced-the reds from Grenache noir, Mourvèdre, Syrah, Carignan and Cinsaut grapes; the white are made from a blend of Grenache blanc and Grenache gris. The boundaries of the AOC are identical with the Banyuls AOC as many of the grapes grown in Collioure are destined for use in the fortified &quot;Vins doux naturels&quot; of the region. The grapes that do not get used for Banyuls are then produced as non-fortified still wines under the Collioure AOC.

==History==

Viticulture was likely introduced to the area soon after the ancient Greeks introduced winemaking to the Languedoc area in the 6th century BC. Under the Romans, viticulture spread throughout the area with the nearby cities of Narbonne, Carcassonne and Perpignan being major centers for the trade of Roussillon wine from areas like Collioure. For a large part of its history, the region has been under Spanish rule and was even a part of the Catalonia region until the mid-17th century. Like other Roussillon wine regions, this Spanish influence can be seen in the types of wines produced here. Even today, wine experts such as Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson describe the wines of Collioure as being more like Spanish wines in profile than French.

The history of the Collioure region has been closely linked to the wines of Banyuls. For centuries, grapes produced in this region were used to produce the fortified wine that gained an international reputation. It wasn&#x27;t until 1971 that the region gained its own identity with an AOC established for the production of non-fortified red wines.

==Climate and geography==

The Collioure wine region is located along the Mediterranean coast in the Roussillon district, extending from the coast up to the foothills of the Pyrenees which separates the area from the Spanish wine region of Catalonia across the border. Both the mountains and the sea have strong influences on the region&#x27;s distinctly Mediterranean climate. During the summer growing season, temperatures are very warm and dry with the potential for drought. In the evening, cool winds from the mountains descend over the vineyards and this can help moderate temperatures for the vines.

Vineyard soils in the area range from alluvial soils near the sea and rivers to more gravel, limestone and schist based soils closer to the foothills of the Pyrenees. The soil types will affect the resulting style of wine with the more schist-based soils on the higher slopes of the foothills producing more intense, full bodied wines while the more alluvial soils closer to the sea will produce lighter styles of wine.

==Viticulture and winemaking==

Many producers in Collioure also produce wines under the Banyuls label, which tends to have more prestige and fetch a higher price on the international wine market. The nature of the vintage will usually determine what percentage of Collioure grapes are used for Banyuls and what percentage will remain Collioure. When grapes are destined to become Collioure they are usually harvested a couple of weeks earlier than the grapes that are destined to be fortified. This is because the warm climate of the region causes grape sugars to rise as acids in the grapes drastically fall. While fortified wines value the high percentage of residual sugar from very ripe grapes, non-fortified wines need more of the balance from the remaining acids. Often, though, winemakers will still need to add additional acids such as tartaric acid in a process known as acidification. In a typical vintage about one-third of the grapes harvested in the region will be used for Collioure AOC labeled wines. 

Grapevines in Collioure are trained as &quot;bush vines&quot; which, along with their age, contributes to the very low yields of Collioure. In fact, the yields from this area are often among the lowest in France - often lower than the AOC maximum of 2.3 tones per acre (40 hectoliters per hectare). Wines produced in Collioure also must not rise above a maximum alcohol level of 15% (min 12% for red, 11.5% for &quot;rose&quot; and whites)and residual sugar level of 5 grams per liter. This low sugar levels means that all wines from Collioure are technically dry wines but wine drinkers they may perceive &quot;sweetness&quot; due to the very high levels of ripeness the grapes attain in the warm climate of the region.

==Grapes and the Wine made in Collioure==

The primary grapes of the Collioure AOC are Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre with Carignan and Cinsaut playing minor roles. The Mourvedre planted in Collioure is used almost exclusively for still wine production and is very rarely used in the production of Banyuls. The &quot;rose&quot; is produced mainly from the red wine grapes that have received very brief skin contact and maceration time or it maybe produced from a &quot;saignée&quot; method where some wine is &quot;bleed off&quot; from the fermenting vats of red wines before much of the color inducing phenolic compounds have taken hold. This method produces a more intensely flavored and darker colored red wine while at the same time producing a high quality &quot;rose&quot;. The whites are usually made from Grenache blanc. The red wines of the region are characterized by their rich, full bodied flavors with spice aroma notes.

As of 2008, there were an estimated 815 acres (330 hectares) of vineyards planted in the boundaries of the Collioure AOC. In 2002, the &quot;encépagement&quot; (or permitted grape components of the AOC wine) was changed which included permitting an AOC white wine for the first time. Today wines labeled Collioure AOC must contain at least a 60% blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre with no individual grape variety permitted to exceed 90% of the total blend. Cinsault and Carignan are allowed to up to a maximum of 30%. Prior to the 2002 AOC change, white wines produced from grapes grown in the Collioure region had to be sold as a &quot;vin de Pays&quot;. Today the AOC white blend must contain a minimum of 70% blend of Grenache blanc and Grenache gris with Macabeo, Malvoisie, Marsanne, Roussanne and Vermentino permitted to round out the remaining portion of the blend - though each of those grape varieties can not individually exceed 15%.

Over the years, the quality of wines produced in the Collioure AOC has steadily increased. Wine experts, such as Andre Domine point to the 1982 &quot;encépagement&quot; change that permitted the use of Syrah and Mourvedre as a turning point. Modern winemaking techniques have also introduced temperature-controlled fermentation and increased the usage of oak barrels for the aging of wine. The most well made reds of Collioure are described as having polished (or &quot;soft&quot;) tannins, a full bodied and deep dark color with spicy aroma and flavor notes. The &quot;roses&quot; of the region can be very aromatic and usually have a raspberry color. They are traditionally paired with the local seafood. The whites can have a golden color and be very full bodied. They are usually consumed within 3 years of harvest.

<text>James Gareth Endicott (December 24, 1898 – November 27, 1993) was a Canadian Christian minister, missionary, and socialist.

== Family and early life ==

Endicott was born in Sichuan Province, China, the third of five children to a Methodist missionary family and became fluent in Chinese. His family returned to Canada in 1910. His father, James Endicott, was elected the second Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 1926 to 1928.

Endicott enlisted in World War I as a Private. After the war he was educated at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Victoria College where he was president of the student council and a founder of the university&#x27;s Student Christian Movement.

Endicott earned a master&#x27;s degree and was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Canada. In 1925, Endicott returned to China as a missionary remaining there for most of the following two decades.

==Missionary in China==
While Endicott was a missionary in China, he taught English in China and became professor of English and Ethics at West China Union University. He became social advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and political advisor to his New Life Movement and served as an advisor to US military intelligence from 1944 to 1945 as a liaison between the American military and the Chinese Communist forces fighting against the Japanese in World War II.

Initially a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, he once compared Chiang to Abraham Lincoln and described Madame Chiang as a combination of Helen of Troy, Florence Nightingale and Joan of Arc. He became disillusioned after seeing Chiang&#x27;s officers starve their troops and by the Kuomintang&#x27;s corruption.

Endicott was impressed by the Communists and became friends with Zhou Enlai as the Chinese Civil War resumed, and he became a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party. During the war he provided an underground network where pro-communist forces could meet and exchange ideas.

After the war, he spoke at student demonstrations, urging opposition to the Nationalist government and provoking criticism from the church in Canada. This led to his resignation from the ministry and the mission on May 5, 1946 after the United Church of Canada gave him an ultimatum to either modify his public statements or quit. In August 1946 Endicott was invited to help write a constitution for the new League for the Protection of Human Rights in China. Paul Yen, Talitha Gerlach, Y. T. Wu and other liberals were also asked to participate. At Zhou En-lai&#x27;s urging, he moved to Shanghai to publish the underground anti-Kuomintang &quot;Shanghai Newsletter&quot;. The newsletter was aimed at westerners in the Kuomintang stronghold as well as at trying to convince western governments that Chiang&#x27;s regime was corrupt and dictatorial.

==Return to Canada==
In 1947, he returned to Canada. At a time when western countries were backing Chiang and were optimistic about his government, Endicott advised the Canadian government that the Kuomintang regime&#x27;s fall was imminent and then went public with his predictions and his denunciation of the Kuomintang as corrupt. His comments were denounced as traitorous by the media and he was labelled the most reviled Canadian of the year for his support of the Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party and was criticized by the United Church for his support of the revolution.

He continued his support for the Chinese Communist Party by giving lectures and publishing the &quot;Canadian Far Eastern Weekly&quot; which had 5,000 subscribers at its peak.

== Canadian Peace Congress ==

In 1949, he founded and became chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress and helped publish its &quot;Peace Letter&quot; bulletin. He also became a senior figure in the World Peace Council serving as president of the International Institute for Peace from 1957 until 1971.

In 1950, as a Canadian delegate to the World Peace Council in Stockholm, Endicott sat on the committee that drafted the Stockholm Peace Appeal which was the petition that began the international &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; movement.

==Korean War==
Endicott returned on a visit to China in 1952, during the Korean War and, on his return to Canada, charged the United States with using chemical and biological weapons during the war. His charges led him to be vilified in the Canadian press as &quot;public enemy number one&quot; and he was censured by the United Church for his support of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communists.

He was condemned by Canadian politicians, including Lester Pearson who had been a college friend. Pearson called him the &quot;bait on the end of a Red hook&quot; and a &quot;Red stooge&quot; while John Diefenbaker called his statements &quot;damnable,&quot; and Conservative leader George Drew referred to Endicott as a &quot;jackal of the Communists.&quot;

The government threatened to charge him with treason and sedition, but did not follow through, while others called for him to lose his passport and mailing privileges.

== Later work ==

Endicott was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1952 for his efforts working for &quot;peaceful coexistence between the Christians and the Communists&quot;. He continued his advocacy for the People&#x27;s Republic of China by publishing the &quot;Canadian Far East Newsletter&quot; and though he publicly backed the Soviet Union in the initial years of the Sino-Soviet split, he was sympathetic to China&#x27;s arguments and reported them in the newsletter. Endicott was offered the presidency of the World Peace Council in the early 1960s but declined due to his wife&#x27;s declining health and what he anticipated as a personally untenable position of leading the council during a period of growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China and their respective factions on the council.

In 1982, the United Church extended a formal apology to Endicott for having denounced him three decades earlier, acknowledging that it had caused him &quot;much personal hurt and anxiety&quot;.

In 1983, Endicott was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by York University.

==Tiananmen Square and later views on China==
In an interview shortly before his death, Endicott said that he thought the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; is &quot;still as true as ever,&quot; though he feels the &quot;old men&quot; who are Communist leaders like Deng Xiaoping are not progressive enough.

Though ambivalent about the policies of Deng and initially supportive of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Endicott was sympathetic to the Chinese government&#x27;s dilemma in dealing with what he came to see as a counterrevolutionary movement. He told an interviewer, 
What is more clear to me now is that there was a core of students who were concerned mainly with getting something done about corruption in the party and in the society. I said at the time they should be supported. But a lot of the leaders, who at the time appeared to be idealistic, turned out to be agents for a capitalist restoration. It appears now that the Communist government was relatively correct in saying that very few people were killed in Tiananmen – perhaps two or three hundred, at most. But in another western section of Beijing, a lot of people were killed. There was practically a shoot-out between the capitalist roaders and the socialists – if you can call the army socialists. 

Arguing that there was an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, Endicott stated, What took place was a minor civil war. The army&#x27;s action in upholding the constitution probably prevented the capitalist roaders from really making an attempt to take over by military force. What was the government to do? Not react?

==Relationship with Canadian Communists==
In 1971, William Kashtan, general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada asked him to resign from the Canadian Peace Congress and as Canada&#x27;s delegate to the World Council of Peace accusing the &quot;Canadian Far East Newsletter&quot; of being anti-Soviet and pro-Mao. Endicott agreed to leave the organization rather than stop publication of the newsletter or withdraw his support for China in its conflict with the Soviet Union. He founded the Canada-China Society shortly after leaving the Canadian Peace Congress and publicly broke with the Soviet Union.

Though friendly with Tim Buck, Stanley Ryerson, Leslie Morris and other Canadian Communists, Endicott never joined the Communist Party of Canada though three of his children joined its legal front, the Labor-Progressive Party. He had joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation while living in Toronto on sabbatical from 1941 to 1944, and campaigned for the party in the 1942 federal by-election in which Joseph Noseworthy won an upset victory, but his membership lapsed when he returned to China. When he applied to rejoin the CCF in 1948 his membership application was rejected; no reason was given but it is almost certain it was rejected due to Endicott&#x27;s perceived association with Communism.

<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation is a 1989 American Christmas slapstick comedy film and the third installment in &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Vacation&quot; film series. &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, written and co-produced by John Hughes, and starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, and Randy Quaid with supporting roles by Miriam Flynn, William Hickey, Mae Questel (in her final film role before her death in 1998), Diane Ladd, John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Juliette Lewis, and Johnny Galecki.

Based on Hughes&#x27;s short story, &quot;Christmas &#x27;59&quot;, published in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, the film tells the story of Clark Griswold&#x27;s efforts to have a good old-fashioned family Christmas as they take a hilarious turn for the worse. It is the final film in the series to involve Hughes and &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Filming took place in Summit County, Colorado, Silverthorne, Breckenridge, and Frisco as well as Burbank, California between March and June 1989. The film performed well at the box office, grossing $73.3 million against a $25 million budget. It initially received generally mixed reviews from critics, but the film’s critical reception improved over time, and it became seen as a Christmas classic.

==Plot==
Chicago-area resident Clark Griswold intends to have a great Christmas with his entire family. He drives his wife Ellen and children Audrey and Rusty out to the country to find a tree, ultimately choosing the largest one they can find. Realizing too late that they did not bring any tools to cut down the tree, they are forced to uproot it instead. Clark&#x27;s holiday plans inadvertently cause steadily escalating chaos for the family&#x27;s yuppie neighbors, Todd and Margo Chester.

When both Clark&#x27;s and Ellen&#x27;s parents arrive for Christmas, their bickering quickly begins to annoy the family. However, Clark maintains a positive attitude and remains undeterred in his plans. He covers the house&#x27;s entire exterior with thousands of lights, which temporarily cause a citywide power shortage once he gets them to work properly.

Ellen&#x27;s cousin Catherine and her redneck husband Eddie arrive unannounced with two of their younger children, Rocky and Ruby Sue, and their pet Rottweiler, Snots. Eddie later admits they are living in the RV in which they arrived, as he went broke and had to sell their home and land. Clark offers to buy gifts for Eddie&#x27;s kids so they can still enjoy Christmas. Soon afterward, Clark&#x27;s senile Aunt Bethany and cantankerous Uncle Lewis arrive.

Clark begins to wonder why his boss, Frank Shirley, has not given him his yearly bonus, which he desperately needs to pay for a new swimming pool. After a disastrous Christmas Eve dinner due to the turkey being overcooked, Aunt Bethany&#x27;s cat is electrocuted and Uncle Lewis accidentally burns down the Christmas tree while lighting his cigar. Soon after, a courier delivers an envelope. Instead of the bonus Clark expects, it is a membership in Jelly of the Month club. He snaps and during his tirade he angrily wishes for Frank to be delivered to the house so he can insult him to his face.

Taking Clark&#x27;s request literally, Eddie kidnaps Frank, who admits to canceling the Christmas bonuses but then reinstates them in the face of Clark&#x27;s chastisement. Frank&#x27;s wife Helen calls the police and a SWAT team storms the Griswold house and holds everyone at gunpoint. Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the SWAT leader, both of whom scold him for canceling the bonuses until he reveals his change of heart. The family goes outside when Rocky and Ruby Sue believe they see Santa Claus in the distance. Clark tells them it is actually the Christmas Star and that he finally realizes what the holiday means to him.

Uncle Lewis says that the light is coming from a sewage treatment plant, reminding Clark that Eddie had been dumping his RV sewage into the nearby storm drain. Before Clark can stop him, Uncle Lewis lights another cigar and tosses the match into the drain, causing a giant gas explosion which sets a Santa&#x27;s sleigh decoration afire and launches it into the sky. Aunt Bethany starts singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and everyone joins in as the flaming decoration flies into the distance. The entire family, along with the Shirleys and the SWAT team, go inside to celebrate while Clark and Ellen share a Christmas kiss. Clark is satisfied that he has provided a great Christmas for his family, while Snots stares at him and gets petted in return.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; originated from a short story by writer John Hughes called &quot;Christmas &#x27;59&quot;, which was published in the December 1980 issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. &quot;The studio came to me and begged for another one, and I only agreed because I had a good story to base it on,&quot; said Hughes. &quot;But those movies have become little more than Chevy Chase vehicles.&quot; Director Chris Columbus initially was to direct the film, but due to a personality clash between himself and Chase, Columbus left the film and was replaced by Chechik. Hughes eventually gave Columbus the script to &quot;Home Alone&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on March 27, 1989, in Summit County, Colorado, with footage shot in Silverthorne, Breckenridge, and Frisco. From there the production moved to Warner Bros. Ranch Facilities in Burbank, California, where the set of the Griswold family&#x27;s house and street is located. The animated title sequence was created by Kroyer Films. Filming wrapped on June 30, 1989.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; was composed by Angelo Badalamenti. It is the only installment of the &quot;Vacation&quot; film series not to include Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Holiday Road&quot;. In its place is a song entitled &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; with music by Barry Mann, lyrics by Cynthia Weil and performed by Mavis Staples of The Staple Singers fame. The song was covered in 2007 by &quot;High School Musical&quot; star Monique Coleman for the 2007 Christmas album &quot;Disney Channel Holiday&quot;. Popular Christmas songs featured in the film include Bing Crosby &amp; The Andrews Sisters Hawaiian-themed &quot;Mele Kalikimaka&quot;, and, during the climax of the film, Gene Autry&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot;. For the latter song, Autry&#x27;s re-recorded 1957 Challenge Records version is used.

Despite several popular songs being present in the film, no official soundtrack album was released. In 1999, a bootleg copy containing music featured in the film along with select cuts of dialogue dubbed as the &quot;10th Anniversary Limited Edition&quot; began to appear on Internet auction sites with the claim that Warner Bros. and RedDotNet had pressed 20,000 CDs for Six Flags Magic Mountain employees to sell to customers entering the park but that only 7,000 had been sold and now the remainder were being made available to the public. However forums at movie music sites such as SoundtrackCollector later declared the disc to be a bootleg due to its inaccuracies. For instance, the cut &quot;Christmas Vacation Medley&quot; (claiming to be the work of composer Angelo Badalamenti) is really a track called &quot;Christmas at Carnegie Hall&quot; from &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; by composer John Williams and does not actually contain any of Badalamenti&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; score.

==Home media==
The film has been released on home media several different times: VHS and Laserdisc in early 1990, a bare bones full-screen DVD in 1997, and a widescreen &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD in 2003. HD DVD as well as Blu-ray editions were released in 2006. In 2009, a second Blu-ray of the film was released as an &quot;Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. A steelbook Blu-ray was released in 2015 with remastered picture quality, and a second steelbook was released in 2019. On November 1, 2022, the film was released on 4K Ultra HD for the first time.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The movie debuted at No. 2 at the box-office while grossing $11,750,203 during the opening weekend, behind &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. The movie eventually topped the box-office charts in its third week of release and remained No. 1 the following weekend. It went on to gross a total of $71,319,546 in the United States while showing in movie theaters. It was the highest-grossing film in the series, until the release of &quot;Vacation&quot; in 2015.

===Critical response===
At the time of the film&#x27;s release, the film received mixed reviews. Over time, many have deemed it a Christmas classic. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that of film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;While &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; may not be the most disciplined comedy, it&#x27;s got enough laughs and good cheer to make for a solid seasonal treat.&quot; Another review aggregation website, Metacritic, assigned the film a rating of 49 out of 100 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot; responded positively to the film stating, &quot;Solid family fare with plenty of yucks, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; is Chevy Chase and brood doing what they do best. Despite the title, which links it to previous pics in the rambling Vacation series, this third entry is firmly rooted at the Griswold family homestead, where Clark Griswold (Chase) is engaged in a typical over-reaching attempt to give his family a perfect, old-fashioned Christmas.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a positive review explaining that &quot;it will prove pater-familiar to fans of the 1983 original and the &quot;European Vacation&quot; sequel. Only it&#x27;s a bit more whimsical.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, saying, &quot;The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

==Other media==
===Sequels===
The fourth film in the series, &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, would follow in 1997, without the involvement of either Hughes or National Lampoon.
In 2003, NBC aired a spin-off called &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation 2&quot; which featured Cousin Eddie&#x27;s family on a Christmas vacation in the South Pacific. Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, and Dana Barron reprise their roles from the previous &quot;Vacation&quot; films alongside series newcomers Jake Thomas, Edward Asner, Sung Hi Lee, and Fred Willard.

===In popular culture===
In 2012, Chevy Chase, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, and Juliette Lewis reunited for &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;-themed ads for Old Navy. The series of ads also featured the other actors who portrayed past versions of Russ and Audrey. In 2020, Chase and D&#x27;Angelo reprised their roles as Clark and Ellen in a Ford commercial for the Ford Mustang Mach-E spoofing the house lighting scene. The movie has inspired the theme for various Christmas lights and decoration displays over the years.

<text>Côtes du Roussillon () is an Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée for wines made in the Roussillon wine region of France. It is the least selective AOC in the Roussillon region. In 2002, 21,048,500 litres of Côtes du Roussillon were produced, 68% red, 28% rosé and 4% white. Grenache is the dominant variety in Red and Rosé. According to the AOC rules, however, red wines must be made with at least three varieties of grapes. The total of the two main variety grapes should not make more than 90% of the blend, and there must not be more than 60% of Carignan in it. 

==Grape varieties==
Côtes du Roussillon are made with the traditional variety grapes of the Roussillon, that is Grenache noir, Grenache blanc, Carignan, Lladoner Pelut, Cinsault, Macabeu and Malvoisie and with some new to the region variety grapes: Syrah, Mourvèdre, Roussanne, Marsanne (all from Côte du Rhone) and Vermentino (from Italy).

==Côtes du Roussillon Villages AOC==
Côtes du Roussillon-Villages is a sub-appellation in the northern half of the appellation in the valley of the river Agly, from the best slopes around the valley. The appellation is in the foothills of the Pyrenees and the better wines are normally produced from vines on the slopes, not in the valley floors. It is purely for red wines, with stricter appellation regulations than regular Côtes du Roussillon. 

The blend allowed is: Carignan (maximum 60%), Syrah, Mourvèdre (minimum 30% combined), Grenache noir, Lladoner. Note that a minimum of three varieties are allowed in the blend.

<doc id="1125245" wikidata="Q6205088" url="?curid=1125245" title="Livingston Taylor">
<text>Livingston Taylor (born November 21, 1950) is an American singer-songwriter and folk musician. Born in Boston and raised in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, he is the brother of singer-songwriter James Taylor, singer-songwriter Kate Taylor, singer Alex Taylor, and innkeeper and singer Hugh Taylor. Taylor is most notable for his &quot;Billboard&quot; hits &quot;I Will Be In Love With You&quot;, &quot;First Time Love&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Come Running&quot;.

He continues to perform nationally and internationally, and has collaborated with Linda Ronstadt, Jimmy Buffett, Jethro Tull, and his brother James Taylor. He has been a faculty member at Berklee College of Music since 1989.

==Early life==
Taylor was born to parents Isaac M. &quot;Ike&quot; Taylor and Gertrude &quot;Trudy&quot; Taylor in Boston, Massachusetts. He grew up in North Carolina when his father, a physician, accepted a position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His mother had been a student at the Music Conservatory in Boston. He was the fourth of five children, his siblings being Alex (1947–1993), James (born 1948), Kate (born 1949), and Hugh (born 1952).

At an early age, Taylor built a repertoire of folk songs. &quot;From his high chair in the kitchen, little Liv memorized the radio jingle for snuff, chanting &#x27;If your snuff&#x27;s too strong, it wrong. Get Tuberose.&#x27;&quot; His mother, Trudy, recounted that Taylor &quot;was always inventing things&quot;. &quot;He and James would make a stringed instrument out of a gourd, or a gut-bucket bass from a broom pole and a washtub, or a flute out of a garden hose, or drums out of cans.&quot; Family sing-a-longs took place as a way for Trudy to pass the time while her husband was away. During those early family musical performances, James played cello, Alex played violin, Kate dulcimer, and Livingston banjo. As recounted by James, &quot;We sang African songs, union songs, folk hymns and radio jingles. Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and The Weavers were the records we most listened to. It was their mother, Trudy, who was the catalyst for the children to create their own songs. One day while in the kitchen, she held up a can of vegetables saying: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you invent an ad jingle about this can of food?&quot; &quot;Alex, James, and Livingston took up their banjo, cello and harmonica and began to improvise some musical sloganeering as Kate and Trudy joined in.&quot; These impromptu performances were christened the &quot;kitchen concerts&quot; by Trudy. They would continue until the children were old enough to leave home for their secondary education at boarding schools.

When Livingston was eight, his mother took him and his siblings to Europe, crossing the Atlantic on the &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;. Their father, Ike, met them in Europe and they all returned home on the &quot;Ile De France&quot;.

Taylor credits his eldest brother, Alex, for inspiring him, at age 13, to be a musician after Alex returned home one evening having earned $20 performing at a fraternity party. Livingston picked up the guitar and became quite accomplished by age 17.

The Taylor family started vacationing on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in the early 1950s, and Livingston has spent every summer there. His parents bought a home there in 1963, and in 1977 Livingston purchased his own 300-square-foot home for $111,000. He refers to the small home as &quot;The Camp&quot;.

==Career==

=== 1960s ===
Taylor began playing music in public for pay in 1963. In Chapel Hill, he was part of a folk trio with guitarist Paul Collins and singer Kim Packer. They covered hits by The Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul and Mary. In junior high he was in a rock group for a short period of time. His first serious attempt at songwriting came in 1966 while he was completing his secondary school education at McLean&#x27;s Arlington School. He says that that first song, &quot;I&#x27;m Searching for a Miracle&quot;, was &quot;terrible&quot;, but his second attempt, a song titled &quot;Good Friends&quot;, became part of his folk setlist for the next four decades.

In 1968, Manny Greenhill, who had managed Joan Baez for a time, got him a booking at a YMCA in Worcester, which led to some shows at Boston University. It was during one of those shows at BU that he had the opportunity to open for Joni Mitchell.

Around this time, producer Jon Landau suggested to Taylor that he approach the Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records founded by Phil Walden and Jerry Wexler.

=== 1970s ===
Taylor was one of the first artists to sign with Capricorn Records in 1970. Landau gathered session players Pete Carr (guitar), Paul Hornsby (keyboards), Robert Popwell (bass) and Johnny Sandlin (drums). &quot;We made a lot of the album in Macon, and then we came up to Boston to finish off a few vocals...and then we mixed it in Detroit because Jon was recording an album with a group called MC5.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Livingston Taylor&quot;, was produced by Landau (who would later produce Bruce Springsteen) and included the song &quot;Carolina Day&quot;. &quot;Carolina Day&quot; peaked at No. 93 on the Billboard Top-100 chart. The debut album included ten originals written by Taylor and one cover: &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot; penned by Earl Greene and Carl Montgomery.

By 1970 Taylor&#x27;s parents, Ike and Trudy, were legally separated. Several of the Taylor children moved north from North Carolina. Livingston and his then-girlfriend Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Shea moved into a cottage in Weston, Massachusetts.

The following year, Taylor&#x27;s second album, &quot;Liv&quot;, also on Capricorn Records and produced by Landau, was released. It included the song &quot;Get Out of Bed&quot; which peaked at No. 97 on Billboard. Once again, Joe Viglione penned the AllMusic review, stating that &quot;Get Out of Bed&quot; &quot;is a brilliant and exciting slice of pop music&quot; and that &quot;with the understated production of Jon Landau, Livingston&#x27;s beautiful heartfelt vocals make this an extraordinary work of art.&quot;

Taylor&#x27;s third and final album on Capricorn, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was released in 1973 and features guest vocalists James Taylor and Carly Simon on his original &quot;Be My New Horizon&quot;. In her album review, Denise Sullivan wrote that the title track was &quot;an inspired vocal version&quot; of a song that has been interpreted by many others.

Taylor left Capricorn Records and released the first of two albums on Epic Records, &quot;Three Way Mirror&quot;, in 1978. The album featured &quot;I Will Be In Love With You,&quot; which peaked at No. 30 on Billboard, and &quot;Going Round One More Time,&quot; a song that was later recorded by his brother James Taylor for his 1985 album &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;. Livingston Taylor promoted &quot;Three Way Mirror&quot; when he toured with Linda Ronstadt as her opening act.

In 1979, Capricorn Records released &quot;Echoes&quot;, a collection of songs from Taylor&#x27;s first three albums that included &quot;I Will Be In Love With You.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau appraised the compilation and Taylor&#x27;s career up to that point: &quot;Vocally, Liv is almost James&#x27;s twin but not quite—he adds a touch of depth to the lissome drawl and subtracts all wow and flutter. Since what makes James unique is also what makes him repulsive, I find Liv more likable but less interesting—especially given his songwriting, which this best-of, drawn from his three early &#x27;70s LPs, makes the best of. I ask you, what good is a funny voice without a sense of humor?&quot;

During the 1970s, Taylor appeared on several nationally televised variety shows including &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Dinah!&quot; (hosted by Dinah Shore), &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980 Taylor released his second album on the Epic label, &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, which was produced by John Boylan and Jeff Baxter. The album contained the songs: &quot;First Time Love,&quot; and &quot;Pajamas&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Pajamas On&quot;), which was later adapted into a book for children written by Taylor and his wife, Maggie. In his album review, Joe Viglione wrote that &quot;&quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; boasts superb musicianship, high production values, good song selection, beautiful vocal performances from Livingston Taylor, and an impressive cast of guest stars who do not get in the way of the singer/songwriter&quot;. Guest vocalists included Carla Thomas and Don Henley.

In 1982, Taylor made an appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

In 1984, Taylor hosted a nationally syndicated television show, similar to &quot;American Bandstand&quot; called &quot;This Week&#x27;s Music&quot;. In some markets the show aired five days weekly. Musical guests included Paul McCartney and Jon Bon Jovi.

In 1986, Livingston and his siblings, James, Kate, Hugh, and Alex Taylor played live on the &quot;Today Show&quot; on Christmas morning.

In 1988, Taylor&#x27;s first of two children&#x27;s books, &quot;Pajamas&quot;, co-written with his wife, Maggie Taylor was published by Harcourt. In her review for &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, Patricia Dooley wrote &quot;If we knew the tune we could hum along: the lyrics of a children&#x27;s song make up the text of this bedtime book.&quot; She goes on to say that the illustrator &quot;has provided cuddly-looking acrylics, a smug little kid, and a passle of appealing stuffed animals.&quot;

Taylor&#x27;s one album on the Sony Records label, &quot;Life Is Good&quot;, was produced by Artie Traum and Scott Petito and released in 1988. &quot;The tribute to Louis Armstrong is an essential element of Taylor&#x27;s ability to put together albums that are extraordinary in their perfection.&quot; The following year the album was the winner of the 1989 Boston Music Award for Outstanding Folk Album.

In 1989, he began teaching the class &quot;stage performance&quot; at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. (See additional details in Berklee section below.)

On November 21, 1989, his 39th birthday, Taylor made a decision to give up alcohol and pursue a lifelong dream of flying. He bought an airplane and enrolled in aviation classes.

In the late 1980s, Taylor wrote and performed the theme songs for two local Boston-area TV programs: the children&#x27;s series &quot;A Likely Story&quot; (produced by WCVB-TV) and the weeknight infotainment program &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; (produced by WBZ-TV).

=== 1990s ===
Taylor worked with Traum and Petito again on the 1991 release &quot;Our Turn to Dance&quot;. In his album review, Jim Worbois wrote: &quot;A talented songwriter in his own right (and most of the album is written or co-written by him) he&#x27;s a good judge of other people&#x27;s songs. Two fine examples are &#x27;No Easy Way to Break Somebody&#x27;s Heart&#x27; by Barry Mann (Yup, the &quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)&quot; guy) and the Jerome Kern classic &#x27;The Way You Look Tonight.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Good Friends&quot;, on the Chesky label, was released in 1993.

The second of Taylor&#x27;s children&#x27;s books, &quot;Can I Be Good?&quot; was published by Harcourt in 1993. In her review for &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, Kate McClelland wrote that the book is &quot;a rhyming story about a fully grown, high-spirited golden retriever who has trouble behaving.&quot; She goes on to say that illustrator Ted Rand &quot;has caught this fractious dog&#x27;s every mood-playfulness, boredom, shame, and remorse&quot; and that the book is &quot;unlikely to be a shelf-sitter.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also reviewed &quot;Can I Be Good?&quot;. Diane Roback and Elizabeth Devereaux wrote: &quot;Children will see themselves in the gleeful activities of a golden retriever who finds that &quot;it&#x27;s awfully hard to be good.&quot;&quot; They go on to say that &quot;Taylor&#x27;s rhyming prose snaps along merrily, upbeat in tempo yet tinged with wry melancholy that reflects the naughty dog&#x27;s exasperation.&quot;

An album of live concert recordings, &quot;Unsolicited Material&quot;, again on the Chesky label, was released in 1994. The album &quot;captured the warm-hearted fun of Taylor&#x27;s concerts and ranged from humorous tunes including Andy Breckman&#x27;s &quot;Railroad Bill&quot; and &quot;The Dollar Bill Song,&quot; a medley of &quot;Songs That Should Never Be Played on the Banjo,&quot; and the originals &quot;Jacques Cousteau&quot; and &quot;I Hate Country Music&quot; to heartfelt renditions of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; and Earl Scruggs&#x27; &quot;Earl&#x27;s Breakdown.&quot;

For his 1996 Chesky label release &quot;Bicycle&quot;, Taylor &quot;assembled a diverse backing group (which features his brother James) and dug into a set of songs that were rootiser and more eclectic than much of his previous work&quot;. &quot;Boatman&quot; a song on the &quot;Bicycle&quot; album was later recorded by his brother James in 1997.

&quot;Ink&quot;, a collection of R&amp;B cover songs, was released on the Chesky label in 1997. &quot;Songs made famous by Ray Charles, The Jackson Five, and Stevie Wonder are re-imagined via the gentle, genial imagination of Livingston Taylor.&quot;

In 1998, an eighteen track retrospective of the first decade of Taylor&#x27;s career, &quot;Carolina Day: The Livingston Taylor Collection&quot; was released. In 1999 a second live album &quot;Snapshot: Live at the Iron Horse&quot; was released. It included &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, a tribute to his father.

=== 2000s ===
In the spring of 2001, as his new home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was completed, he separated from his wife Maggie after 25 years of marriage.

From 2000 through September 2006, Taylor was artist-in-residence at Lowell House.

A second retrospective was released in 2005 with &quot;20th Century Masters – The Millennium Collection: The Best of Livingston Taylor&quot;.

In 2006 Taylor released his first studio album in nine years, &quot;There You Are Again&quot;. In his review, Hal Horowitz wrote: &quot;The extended wait between albums has paid off in the immaculate production devoted to each song.&quot; Musicians include drummer Steve Gadd, keyboardist Matt Rollings, saxophonist David Sanborn, and bass player Leland Sklar. Taylor&#x27;s brother, James, and sister, Kate, provide backup vocals on &quot;There I&#x27;ll Be&quot;. Additional backup vocals are provided by Vince Gill and Pam Tillis while former sister-in-law Carly Simon sings a duet with Taylor on &quot;Best of Friends&quot;.
Spiritual overtones are evident on two tracks: Andraé Crouch conducts the New Day Jubilee Gospel Choir on &quot;Step by Step&quot; and the a cappela choir Take 6 helps out on &quot;Tell Jesus (To Come to My House).

=== 2010s ===

In 2010 Taylor released &quot;Last Alaska Moon&quot;, produced by Glenn Rosenstein. Musicians include bassist Leland Sklar; drummer Steve Gadd; guitarists Vince Gill, Chris Rodriguez, and J.T. Corenflos; keyboardist Shane Keister, and vocalist Andrea Zonn. The album consists of ten originals and two covers, &quot;Answer My Prayer&quot; with Carole Bayer Sager and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, a duet with nephew Ben Taylor.

Four years later, Taylor released &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, a collection of both original songs and covers of some pop classics.

The year 2017 marked Taylor&#x27;s 50th year in the music business. To commemorate this milestone, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker declared January 18, 2017 to be Livingston Taylor Day in Boston. Taylor was recognized for his 50-year music career, as well as being a long-time professor at Berklee College of Music. That evening a party held at the Verb Hotel in Boston was attended by friends and family including Taylor&#x27;s sister, Kate, niece Sally Taylor, along with Sally&#x27;s mother, long-time friend, Carly Simon, Don Law, and Norman Chesky.
Two days later, Taylor announced the forthcoming release of &quot;Safe Home&quot; which was officially released on March 3, 2017. The album was recorded in an abandoned church in Brooklyn, New York with musicians Shelly Berg on piano, David Finck on bass, Bashiri Johnson on percussion and Chelsea Berry providing vocals. Like Taylor&#x27;s previous album &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Safe Home&quot; includes original songs as well as show tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein and others. In his review of the album, Jason Warburg wrote: &quot;That&#x27;s what the aptly-named &quot;Safe Home&quot; feels like: an impromptu after-dinner living room concert with Livingston Taylor and friends. Taylor&#x27;s voice has that rich, unique timbre of New England-by-way-of-North-Carolina that he and his brother James have made famous, lending both his vocals and his superb acoustic guitar picking a sense of instant familiarity and comfort.&quot; Cover songs include Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Anything You Can Do&quot; and the Everly Brothers &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;. Warburg wrote that the opening song, &quot;I Must Be Doing Something Right&quot;, a Taylor original, &quot;has the timeless feel of a Cole Porter tune&quot;. In his review, Harris Fogel wrote:&quot;this is a lovely collection of tunes, smooth, gentle, and relaxing. This is quiet, confident yet not showy musicianship. The guitar solos, the bass lines, vocals and percussion all work together to create a quiet intimate experience. Highly recommended for the Gentle and Loving People in Your Life.&quot;

On April 4, 2017, Taylor announced a crowdfunding campaign to help finish a documentary about his life directed by Tracey Anarella to be released in the fall of 2017. Two months after its launch, an update announced that the crowdfunding campaign had been 109% funded. On October 27, 2017, supporters were sent a downloadable link to the finished film and on November 30, 2017, Fish announced a &quot;soft premier&quot; in the Boston area for Wednesday, February 21, 2018, saying additional details would be forthcoming. Persons interviewed for the documentary, who appear in the film&#x27;s trailer, include: Sally Taylor, Ian Anderson, Carly Simon, Roger H. Brown, and Ben Taylor. The film was scheduled to be screened at the 27th Annual Woods Hole Film Festival, Cape Cod&#x27;s oldest film festival, during the eight-day festival running from July 28 to August 4, 2018.

Taylor began 2018 with a tradition of shows at the Iron Horse Music Hall in Northhampton, Massachusetts on January 5 and 6.

On January 9, 2018, Peter Fish, producer of the &quot;Life is Good&quot; documentary announced that a limited number of tickets would be available at the door for the February 21 premiere of the documentary. The screening took place at NewTV in Newton, Massachusetts.

In early April 2018, it was announced that Taylor would be one of three musicians serving as hosts on a multi-day &quot;Roots on the Rails&quot; tour through Vermont in November. On the tour, one of six &quot;Roots on the Rails&quot; tours scheduled for 2018, Taylor will be joined by musicians Susan Werner and Peter Mulvey.

The First Annual Livingston Taylor Retreat was announced in early summer 2018. In addition to Taylor, instructors announced for the retreat include Melissa Ferrick and Vance Gilbert. The retreat was held August 17–19, 2018 at Boston University.

After eleven years teaching at the Berklee College of Music, Livingston wrote a textbook, &quot;Stage Performance,&quot; which was published by Pocket Books in 2000.&quot;Stage Performance&quot; was Taylor&#x27;s first book written for adults, having published two books for children earlier in his career. A revised edition of the book was published in 2011.

==Personal life==
Taylor married Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Shea on May 1, 1976. After 25 years of marriage, they separated in 2001 and the marriage ended in 2003. During their marriage, they co-authored the 1988 children&#x27;s book &quot;Pajamas&quot;. In 2015, Taylor married Gail Arnold. Wedding guests included Steven Spielberg (for whom Arnold has served as private chef), his brother James, as well as other family members and friends who celebrated the occasion in Belmont, Massachusetts. 
Taylor has been a pilot for over 20 years, often making a 40-minute commute from Boston to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in his 1964 Cessna 205. In his spare time, he enjoys working on lawn mowers, tractors and his motorcycles.

He has maintained a close friendship with his former sister-in-law Carly Simon and the two have collaborated several times. In her memoir, &quot;Boys in the Trees,&quot; Simon states that Livingston Taylor was the first member of the Taylor family whom she met when she drove to the Taylor family home in 1970. She and Livingston were scheduled to perform a duet at a film festival that Simon&#x27;s brother, Peter, was producing and needed to rehearse.

Taylor is the uncle of Ben Taylor, an actor and Indie folk musician.

<text>Maury () is an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) for fortified &quot;vin doux naturel&quot; wines made in the Roussillon wine region of France. Almost all wines are red, made from at least 75% Grenache noir (Garnacha). Other permitted grapes are Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Macabeu (Macabeo), Malvoisie du Roussillon (Tourbat), Syrah, Muscat and other local varieties. Although the grapes are different, they are used and marketed very much like port. It is made in the communes of Maury, Saint-Paul-de-Fenouillet, Lesquerde, Tautavel and Rasiguères. The AOC was granted in 1936.

Maury is a &quot;vin doux naturel&quot; style created by adding fortifying spirits, such as brandy, to the wine in mid-fermentation. This halts the activities of the wine yeast leaving the wine with &quot;natural&quot; residual sugars. Maury is vinified in a manner similar to port, but initial aging is often conducted in large 25 liter (6.6 US gallon/5.5 imperial gallon) glass jugs known as &quot;bonbonnes&quot;, &quot;les dames jeannes&quot; or demi-johns. The wines may also be aged in wood for up to 15 years. The resulting wines vary in depth and concentration.

In food and wine pairings, Maury is often served as an apéritif or as an accompaniment to foie gras, duck and strong blue cheeses. For dessert, aged Maury, much like Banyuls, is recognized as a suitable pairing for chocolate.

==History==

Viticulture was likely first introduced to the area by the Ancient Greeks who settled the coast of southern France in 600 BC. Wines from the area were well known by the time of the Romans.

Much of Maury&#x27;s history is influenced by its location as part of the Roussillon region which was part of the Kingdom of Majorca (and later Crown of Aragon) until 1642, when a revolt against the Spanish crown brought French forces into the region. The 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees officially brought the area under the French crown. However, to this day the mix of Spanish and French influence can be seen in the winemaking style of Maury, which utilizes Spanish grape varieties such a Garnacha/Grenache as well as French Syrah.

The style of winemaking that would become associated with Maury has its roots in the work of the Catalan alchemist and physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. He perfected the technique of stopping fermentation with distilled alcohol in the late 13th century and was given an exclusive patent on the process by King James II of Majorca. In 1872, Roussillo politician François Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; as wines which had residual sugar and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with grape spirits. In 1936, the &quot;Institut national de l&#x27;origine et de la qualité&quot; (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC.

==Climate and geography==

As part of the Roussillon region the climate of Maury is warm, dry and very Mediterranean influenced. The nearby town of Perpignan is one of the sunniest places in all of France with an average annal temperature of . However Maury&#x27;s location northwest of Perpignan, in the hilly hinterlands of the Agly valley, does temper some of the Mediterranean influence with westward winds from the Atlantic, bringing a slightly cooler influence to the valley. Similar to the Mistral influence in the Rhône, the dry northward wind Tramontane serves to cool the grapes but is much more gentle and less frequent than the powerful Mistral that can damage the vines.

In the shadow of the remains of the Cathar stronghold Château de Quéribus, the soils of Maury are a mix of schist and slate. Closer to the communes of Lesquerde the soil includes more granite, while near the town of Tautavel in the east the soil contains high portions of the &quot;argilo-calcaire&quot; vineyard soils of clay and limestone.

==Winemaking==

As a &quot;vin doux naturel&quot; (or VdN) Maury wines undergo a unique form of winemaking that shares elements with other notable fortified wines like Port, Sherry, Madeira and &quot;vin de liqueur&quot;. An English translation of the name would be &quot;wines naturally sweet&quot; and refers to the natural residual sugars of the grapes that are left unfermented in the wine. However these sugars are left because of the outside addition of grape spirits (or brandy) added early in the fermentation period that kills the yeast and halts the fermentation process. This process, called &quot;mutage&quot; leaves a partially fermented must (called the &quot;vin muté&quot;) with 6 to 12% alcohol from the fermentation and 5-10% alcohol by volume from the brandy. The amount of residual sugar left in the wine will vary from 50 to 125 g/L (5 to 12.5% RS).

Prior to fermentation, the grapes destined for Maury production (predominantly Grenache) are harvested very ripe usually with a potential alcohol level (based on the amount of grape sugar alone) at 14.5% (around 25 to 27°Bx or 13.8 to 15 Baumé). After crushing, the must usually undergoes a period of extended maceration that can last up to 30 days. During this time the cap of grapes skins is frequently punched down (&quot;pigeage&quot;) or the juice pulled out from under the tank and pumped over the cap to allow for a more thorough extraction of phenolics that influence tannin, colour and aroma.

Usually during this maceration, the fermentation process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar. Often the wine will have fermented to the point where the grape spirits are added before maceration has ended and the wine is pressed off the skins, a process known as &quot;mutage sur grains&quot;. The added alcohol during maceration allows for more ethanol-soluble phenolics and flavor compounds to be extracted. After pressing, the wine is left to settle in concrete vats over the winter before it is racked into barrels or other containers.
Since the fermentation process is halted rather quickly, the flavors of Maury do retain some of the natural primary grape aromas of Grenache along with some of the early fermentation esters that develop. But most of the distinctive character of Maury come from the aging process that can take place in a wide range of containers (from concrete and oak barrels to glass &quot;bonbonnes&quot;) kept in a variety of conditions (including out in the sun for deliberate oxidation) for a number of years depending the particular house style of the winemaker.

=== Rancio ===
One style of Maury known as &quot;rancio&quot; is produced when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or &quot;bonbonne&quot; and left out in the summer sun to oxidize and age. This causes many of the colour compounds and tannins in the wines to fall out, leaving a thick, dark coloured deposit in the &quot;bonbonne&quot;. This deposit is allowed to stay in the &quot;bonbonne&quot; to influence the colour and flavour of resulting vintages of wine that are aged in the container. Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large &quot;foudres&quot; oak cask or sold separately as &quot;Maury Rancio&quot;.

=== Comparison to Port ===

While the Portuguese wine Port is similarly made with a &quot;mutage&quot; halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.

===Vintage dating===
While vintage Maurys do exist, most wines are a blend of several vintages with some producers even utilizing a solera system of fractional blending similar to Sherry. These wines will often have an estimate age of &quot;bottle date&quot; listed on the wine label instead of a vintage.

Since 1975, more producers have experimented with &quot;vintage&quot; Maurys (called &quot;Rimage&quot; in neighboring Banyuls). These are wines that are bottled early, often without &quot;rancio&quot; or barrel aging. The wines have a very dark red color with strong cherry and ripe flavors with noticeable tannins.

When Maury was first granted its AOC, the minimum Grenache percentage required was only 50%, but that figure has risen steadily over the years and today Maury wines must be made from at least 75% Grenache noir with pre-2000 vintages grandfathered to require minimum of 70%. In reality, most Maury are 90-100% Grenache though other varieties are permitted to be used. These include Macabeo, which is limited to constituting no more than 10% of the blend (15% maximum for pre-2000 vintages), and Carignan, Cinsault, Listan Negra and Syrah which collectively can not make up more than 10% of the blend. Other white grape varieties beyond Macabeo are also permitted including Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Tourbat, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria.

Grapes destined for AOC wine production in Maury are limited to a harvest yield no greater than 30 hectoliters/hectares (approximately 1.6 tons/acre). When the fortified spirits is added is not specifically regulated but the finished wine must have a minimum alcohol level of at least 15%.

Non-fortified table wines produced in the southern reaches of Maury AOC along the Agly valley have been previously eligible for the Côtes du Roussillon-Villages AOC or to be sold as a &quot;vin de pays&quot; under the &quot;Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes&quot; designation. For the 2011 vintage, a new AOC designation of Maury Sec was introduced to allow for dry table wines produced from the same grape varieties permitted for the &quot;vin doux naturel&quot;.

==Production and industry==
In 1998, Maury had of planted vineyard producing 48,086 hectoliters (over 534,000 cases) of wine. By 2003, these numbers had not changed.

Like most of Roussillon, the wine industry of Maury is dominated by co-operatives with Les Vignerons du Maury making the bulk of the yearly production. In recent years, smaller estates experimenting with new winemaking and aging techniques have garnered the attentions of wine writers and critics. These include Mas Amiel and Domaine de la Préceptorie.

== Wine styles ==

According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the wines of Maury are often very tannic in their youth, requiring long barrel aging before they are bottled. Compared to neighboring Banyuls, the &quot;vin doux naturels&quot; of Maury are often noticeably darker in colour.

Wine writer Tom Stevenson notes that Maury wines can come in tawny and &quot;rosé&quot; styles as well as red and are often characterized by toasty, nutty flavours with raisin and tangy berry fruit.

Master of Wine Clive Coates describes the wines having rich flavours of chocolate, black cherries and mocha with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Younger examples will have a fresh raspberry flavour typical of Grenache. In regards to food and wine pairing, Coates notes that Maury are one of the rare wines that pair well with chocolate desserts.

Coates also states that similar to Banyuls, Maury wines are often ready to drink soon after they&#x27;re bottled and do not benefit much from any further aging in the cellar. When opened, the high alcohol content can protect the wine from the effects of oxidation but most of the fruit flavors will leave if the wine is not consumed within a week.

Wine expert Andre Dominé notes that the flavour of Maury will depend on how long it has been aged prior to bottling with the youngest &quot;first phase&quot; Maury wines having candied cherries, fresh figs and stewed fruit aromas while &quot;second phase&quot; wines will develop more dried fruits flavours of raisins, prunes and apricots. Longer aging, seven years or more, will give the wine caramel, cocoa, tobacco and coffee notes while &quot;rancio&quot; style will have green walnut husk and aromas similar to cognacs and &quot;vin jaune&quot; wines from the Jura.

<text>The North Shore Spirit was a minor-league baseball team based in Lynn, Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. The Spirit played in the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball (the &quot;Can-Am League,&quot; also known as the Northeast League), an independent league that is not affiliated with Major League Baseball or with the Minor League Baseball organization. The team was originally known as the Waterbury Spirit, based out of Waterbury, Connecticut.

The Spirit were owned by Nicholas Lopardo throughout their five-year history in Lynn.

==Team history==

===Waterbury Spirit===

The Waterbury Spirit began play in 1997 in the Northeast League. During the team&#x27;s four-year stint in Connecticut, they made the playoffs three times, losing in the first round all three times. The team folded following the 2000 season. Originally, the team was to be known as the &quot;Waterbury Wizards&quot; but a potential lawsuit with the Fort Wayne Wizards prompted the team to seek alternate names.

===Reborn in the North Shore===
Lopardo acquired the team in 2002 when he purchased the inactive franchise. After the formation of the team was announced in August 2002, Lopardo funded a massive, expensive renovation of Fraser Field. $2 million was put into improvements in seating, comfort, and technology of the field, including the installation of FieldTurf in the infield.

In their first season, 2003, 90,000 people attended Spirit games, a record for pro baseball at Fraser Field. In the 2003 season, the Spirit won the first-half North Division championship and defeated the Quebec Capitales in the first round of the playoffs, 3 games to 0, then were swept by the Brockton Rox, 3 games to 0, in the league championship series, giving Brockton the Northeast League title. Another highlight of the 2003 season was a game against the New Jersey Jackals in which the Spirit set over 15 Northeast League records by scoring 14 runs in one inning. On the field, the team featured two players who were signed by Major League Baseball organizations: outfielder Carlos Sepulveda, by the Florida Marlins and second baseman Marcos Agramonte, by the San Diego Padres. Also in that year the team held a ceremony honoring legendary North Shore baseball player Tony Conigliaro and retiring his number 25.

In 2004 the Spirit played host to 120,000 fans, breaking the record they had set the year before, and ranking third in league attendance behind the Brockton Rox and Quebec Capitales. They once again won the first-half North Division Championship, in record fashion, shattering the league record for first half winning percentage with 35 wins in the 46 game half. The Spirit also once again defeated the Quebec Capitales in the first round of the playoffs, 3 games to 2. However, just as in 2003, the Spirit fell in the league championship series, this time to the New Jersey Jackals. The Spirit won the first two games of the series at Yogi Berra Stadium, but dropped the three games at Fraser Field (two after blowing late inning leads and losing in extra innings).

In 2004 the Spirit honored another local baseball legend, Johnny Pesky, affectionately known as &quot;Mr. Red Sox.&quot; The team featured two more players who would be picked up by Major League Organizations, this time, two pitchers: John Kelly and Jeremy Sugarman, who were signed by the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, respectively.

2005 was the first year that the Spirit failed to make the playoffs, but nonetheless they had a good season, finishing with the 2nd best record in the league behind Quebec and drawing over 100,000 fans to Fraser Field for the second consecutive season. On September 3, 2005, the last home game of the season, owner Nick Lopardo responded to rumors of the franchise&#x27;s demise with an emphatic assurance that the Spirit would be back for their fourth season at Fraser Field.

Can-Am League and North Shore Spirit history was made in April 2006 as ex-Spirit player Ken Ray made his team debut for the Atlanta Braves, striking out Barry Bonds as part of a 1-2-3 inning against the San Francisco Giants. Ray became a mainstay in the Atlanta bullpen that season and even served as the team&#x27;s closer for a time.

On July 12, 2006, the Spirit won their third first-half championship in franchise history, qualifying for the 2006 Can-Am League Playoffs. They went on to have the most successful regular season in Can-Am League history.

In the 2006 playoffs, the Spirit were defeated in the first round by the Quebec Capitales, 3-2, splitting the first two games at Fraser Field and then losing two out of three in Quebec City.

Rumors were rampant in late 2006 that the Spirit would leave Lynn, but in November the team confirmed that it would return for a fifth season at Fraser Field, set to begin on May 25, 2007.

In September, 2007, after the 2007 Can-Am playoffs, Nick Lopardo announced that he would cease operations. Their final game was a 6-4 home loss against the Nashua Pride in the third game of the Can-Am League Championship Series. The Spirit were swept 3-0. The attendance in the final game was 803.

Spirit games were broadcast on WESX and WWZN 1510-AM by veteran play-by-play announcer John Leahy.

North Shore&#x27;s team colors were Red, White and Blue. Their mascot, Slugger, was a blue bald eagle.

(The Spirit were followed by the North Shore Navigators, a summer collegiate baseball team, from the Futures Collegiate Baseball League.)

<doc id="1125271" wikidata="Q474278" url="?curid=1125271" title="Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC">
<text>Muscat de Rivesaltes () is an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) for fortified wines (of the type &quot;vin doux naturel&quot;) made in the Roussillon wine region of France. They are similar to Rivesaltes AOC wines, except for the grape varieties used. The wines are white, and made from Muscat d&#x27;Alexandrie and Muscat à Petits Grains grapes, usually in equal quantities, although the appellation rules allow these varieties to be used in any proportion. The alcohol content must be at least 15 per cent by volume, the potential alcohol content at least 21.5 per cent, and the sugar content (fermentable sugars, glucose and fructose) of the finished wine at least 100 grams per liter.

The AOC was created in 1956.

The wine is usually served as an aperitif but in Rivesaltes ville and the surrounding area is commonly drunk by the glass in bars and cafes. A popular local starter is foie gras served with a glass of Muscat de Rivesaltes.

==Muscat de Noël==
Muscat de Noël is a designation for young Muscat de Rivesaltes marketed for the Christmas (&quot;Noël&quot;) season in its harvest year. Muscat de Rivesaltes with the additional designation Muscat de Noël can be marketed from November 1 in its harvest year, while regular Muscat de Rivesaltes can be marketed from February 1 in the year following the harvest.

<doc id="1125283" wikidata="Q455197" url="?curid=1125283" title="Rivesaltes AOC">
<text>Rivesaltes (; ) is an appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC) for naturally sweet, fortified wines (vin doux naturel or VDN). The name refers to both a production region within Languedoc-Roussillon in southern France, and the style of sweet wines produced there.

The Rivesaltes AOC designation of origin has been protected by INAO since 1972, combining several smaller protected designations created in 1936.

==Grapes and styles==
Rivesaltes AOC wines are similar to Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC wines, except the grape varieties are not restricted to Muscat. The wines are red or white. Rivesaltes blanc, using white grapes, appears amber in color, while Rivesaltes rouge appears darker.

The main grapes used for white Rivesaltes wines are Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Macabeu, and Malvoisie du Roussillon; Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria are accessory varietals, which have to be less than 20 percent of the final product. The only grapes allowed for red Rivesaltes wines are Grenache noir, Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Macabeu, and Malvoisie du Roussillon.

Styles can be labeled ambré (amber), grenat (garnet), tuilé (tiled), or rosé, provided they meet certain conditions. These wines can also be labeled (aged) or hors d&#x27;âge (beyond age) provided they meet further conditions.

Rivesaltes style requirements:
* Rivesaltes grenat: The must is macerated for all or part of fermentation. It must have 75 percent Grenache noir and storage in an oxidative environment for a 12-month minimum, including 3 months in bottles.
* Rivesaltes ambré: The must is separated from the pulp before fermentation. It must age in an oxidative environment for a 2-year minimum.
* Rivesaltes tuilé: Red wine with at least 50 percent Grenache noir, aged in an oxidative environment for a 2-year minimum.
* Rivesaltes hors d&#x27;âge: Rivesaltes ambré or tuilé aged for 5 years.
* Rivesaltes rancio: Wines which, depending on aging conditions, have acquired a &quot;&quot; taste.

==Consumption, flavor, and aromas==
Rivesaltes often has aromas and flavors of raisins and other dried fruit, nuts, smoke, resin, chocolate, and caramel, browned sugar or molasses. Rivesaltes made with white grapes can gain aromas of vanilla, baked cherries, and honey. Rivesaltes, especially Rivesaltes rancio, has an aged, umami, bitter quality found in aged cognac, armagnac, and whisky, called rancio. Due to the winemaking process, Rivesaltes is relatively shelf-stable when open, and can remain at room-temperature for several days without losing quality.

According to prominent négociant Philippe Gayral, Rivesaltes is optimal at 50 years of age, and needs a minimum of 20 years before its tannins soften enough.

Rivesaltes can have an affordable price, sometimes less than €10 (about $13 USD) a bottle. Some of these, especially the related Muscat de Rivesaltes, are not considered quality wines.

Rivesaltes is typically served slightly chilled.

==Geography==

Rivesaltes is made in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region, around the commune of Rivesaltes in southern France, historically and culturally part of Northern Catalonia.

The region has about . It is predominantly located over a large portion of the Pyrénées Orientales, extending over 85 communes in the Pyrénées Orientales and 9 communes in the Aude, to the north. The Rivesaltes region borders the foothills of the Canigó to the west, the Mediterranean to the east, and Spain to the south. The region has a wide variety of soil types: granite, gneiss, and brown and black schists around the Agly Massif in the northwest and at the foot of the Albera Massif. There are also red limestone soils by the Corbières Massif, sandy soil by Les Aspres, and stony terraces along the region&#x27;s rivers. Rivesaltes AOC is crossed by three rivers that traverse the area from west to east, draining into the Mediterranean. They are, listed north to south: the Agly, Têt, and Tech. Vineyards in the region are commonly on terraces and hills.

Rivesaltes AOC has a Mediterranean climate, with hot and dry summers. Rain averages annually, spread over few days in spring and fall. The region has about 300 days or 2,555 hours of sunshine each year, called the sunniest in France. It is affected every third day by the Tramontane breeze from the northwest, which dries the region&#x27;s grapevines, and the rest of the time by sea winds.

==Winemaking==

The production process, known in France as &quot;mutage&quot;, is similar to that used to make Port, and dates to the 13th century. A neutral grape spirit is added to the must to halt fermentation while sugar levels are still high, preserving the natural sweetness of the grape. The wines are then matured, sometimes in oak barrels, or typically outside in glass bottles (called demijohns or &quot;bonbonnes&quot;) for a year. While in the sealed bottles, the wine is exposed to sun, rain, temperature swings, and extreme weather; the heat allows the wine to maderise. The wine then matures in barrels for a minimum of four years. The resulting wine bears a similarity to tawny port but tends to be lower in alcohol (~16 percent vs. ~20 percent).

While the similar Banyuls and Maury are typically high-quality, Rivesaltes is made in a wide variety of styles, depending on &quot;terroir&quot; and winemaker skills and preference. Rivesaltes traditionally was made by larger professional wineries and cooperatives, while Banyuls and Maury tended to be made by amateur winemakers but in a more artisanal fashion.

==History==

Rivesaltes AOC was created in 1936. In 1972, a new Rivesaltes AOC was created, combining Rivesaltes, Côtes d&#x27;Agly, and Côtes de haut Roussillon.

By the 2020s, global climate change began to affect the climate of Rivesaltes AOC. Among earlier harvest dates in France, vineyard owners in Rivesaltes began harvesting August 5, instead of the more usual September. They also began machine-picking their grapes at nighttime or starting hand-picking at dawn, as daytime temperatures reached . Weather in 2020 included catastrophic springtime rain, mildew in the summer, and an absence of the Tramontane breeze, followed by drought-like conditions.

<doc id="1125290" wikidata="Q1761045" url="?curid=1125290" title="Remission (EP)">
<text>Remission is a 1984 EP by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy, their record label debut and first release with Nettwerk. The 12-inch EP originally featured six tracks, then, a year later in 1985, it was released on cassette with five additional songs that lengthened the release to a full album. This expansion became the default version of &quot;Remission&quot;.

&quot;Remission&quot; was certified gold by Music Canada on January 31, 2000.

==Release history==

In December 1984, &quot;Remission&quot; was distributed through Nettwerk as Skinny Puppy&#x27;s first major release. Despite being preceded by the embryonic &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot; EP that was limited to just 35 home-printed copies, &quot;Remission&quot; is seen as the band&#x27;s debut effort. To complicate the matter further, most issues of the EP following its release year, 1984, were expanded with five additional tracks, retroactively turning it into a full-blown studio album.

In 1993, Nettwerk released &quot;Remission&quot; on CD using the expanded track listing from the 1985 cassette release. However, this wasn&#x27;t the first time &quot;Remission&quot; appeared in the format; the EP&#x27;s first CD release was in 1987, when it (along with the appended track &quot;Glass Out&quot;) was combined with Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Bites&quot; to form the release &quot;Bites and Remission&quot; (a compilation distinct from the less popular &quot;Remission &amp; Bites&quot;, which was also released in 1987 and also on Nettwerk, but that preserved the original track sequence of &quot;Remission&quot; and the European sequence of &quot;Bites&quot;).

On May 17, 2018, cEvin Key released &quot;Coma&quot;, an instrumental track created during the &quot;Remission&quot; era, through his YouTube channel.

==Background and composition==
Both &quot;Remission&quot; and Skinny Puppy&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Bites&quot; were created before Dwayne Goettel joined in 1986 and helped crystallize the band&#x27;s hard, percussion-driven industrial sound. As such, &quot;Remission&quot; features more synthpop and electro elements than Skinny Puppy would come to be known for. It is the first known commercial release to use a TR-909 drum machine.

In 2013, Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 12th album (4th since being reunited without the presence of Goettel), &quot;Weapon&quot;, was released as a sort of spiritual successor to both &quot;Remission&quot; and &quot;Bites&quot;. Apart from containing a re-recorded version of &quot;Solvent&quot; from &quot;Remission&quot;, &quot;Weapon&quot; was deliberately created with antiquated instruments to achieve their early 1980s-style electronic sound.

==Critical reception==
Contemporary reception of &quot;Remission&quot; was mostly positive. The AllMusic review wrote that the EP &quot;remains the Puppy&#x27;s finest hour. The breadth of vision and amazing instrumental prowess of vocalist Nivek Ogre and sound-designer cEvin Key will likely never be transcended.&quot; Retrospectively, &quot;Remission&quot; gained more praise, being cited as an important influence to many bands. In an article about Skinny Puppy&#x27;s broad influence, Alec Chillingworth of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; wrote, &quot;Al Jourgensen’s Ministry was laughable in ’84, whereas Puppy gave us &quot;Remission&quot;: an EP bursting with potential, exuding a dance-ready racket heavier than anything their contemporaries offered.&quot; &quot;Fact&quot; placed &quot;Remission&quot; at number 19 on their list of 20 best industrial and EBM albums of all time, calling it &quot;excellent electro-pop&quot;.

<text>The People&#x27;s Guard (GL; ; ) was a communist partisan force of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) active in Occupied Poland during World War II from 1942 to 1944.

The &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; was established with sponsorship from the Soviet Union to support the Red Army and Polish communists against Nazi Germany. It became the largest partisan force in Poland which refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State loyal to the London-based Polish government-in-exile. The &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; was incorporated into the larger &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; in January 1944.

== Background ==
The &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; was created on 6 January 1942 with military aid from the Red Army, with the availability of firearms led to it swiftly reaching a strength of 3,000 fighters. It was connected to the NKVD, the intelligence services of the Soviet Union, to the point that some of its military actions were commanded by NKVD colonels. It was tasked with fighting against Nazi Germany by means of partisan warfare, sabotage, and reprisal actions. The full size partisan detachments were formed in May 1942 although foray groups were organized earlier. They operated near Piotrków and Radom. By the end of the year, the organisation was divided onto seven administrative districts including Warsaw, Lublin, Radom-Kielce, Kraków, Łódź, Silesia and Lwów.

==Partisan actions==
First major operations of GL consisted of disassembling train tracks. Until December 1942 some 50 railway lines were damaged resulting in 30 German supply trains being disabled. Some 30 insurgents were caught and hanged, but the number of units grew to over 30 in the same time. The most prominent sabotage action took place on 16 November 1942 along the railway line Radom – Łuków – Terespol, where five trains and a bridge were destroyed with the use of Soviet explosives. Another five trains were derailed around Oświęcim on 25 February 1943. Throughout the year, trains were damaged around Warsaw in Olszynka Grochowska, Elsnerów, Legionowo, Żyrardów and Żywczyn. In total, Gwardia Ludowa caused damage to 169 trains in 1943, as well as 113 train stations, resulting in 55 temporary line shut-downs.

GL retaliation actions included throwing grenades into buildings frequented by the Germans. The &quot;Apollo&quot; movie theatre in Radom was attacked on 22 November 1942; the &quot;Deutsches Haus&quot; in April 1943. In Kraków and Kielce the &quot;Nur für Deutsche&quot; coffee houses were bombed in December 1942 and February 1943 respectively. The German administration building in Rzeszów was bombed also in February. Most of GL operations resulted in great number of Polish and Jewish hostages being shot by the Germans in reprisal.

===Field organization===
GL was divided into partisan units and garrison units assembled for quick ambushes, after which the garrison members returned to their homes. By the end of 1942 GL had approximately 5,000 men, including, at least nominally, every member of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party. By late 1943 the number rose to about 10,000. Among them approximately 1,700 were partisans, and the rest were part-time combatants. For the most part, the GL carried out acts of sabotage, including the sabotage of German rail transport.

===Zamość Uprising===
GL took part in the Zamość uprising - a series of partisan actions against the forced Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany from the Zamość region.

===Warsaw Ghetto Uprising===
Since the formation of GL, its soldiers worked together with Jewish partisans. In Warsaw, Polish communists like Józef Lewartowski were ones of the first organizers of the Jewish resistance in Warsaw Ghetto. During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising People&#x27;s Guard attacked German units near the Ghetto walls and attempted to smuggle weapons, ammunition, supplies, and instructions into the Ghetto. After the uprising was over, GL helped Jews to escape Ghetto and some Jewish militants joined the units of GL.

===Attitudes to Jews===

The leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Yitzhak Zuckerman, wrote in his memoirs: &quot;During the Holocaust [...] those who won our loyalty and helped us with their slim forces were the Polish Communists [...] They hated the Poland of the fascistic &quot;Sanacja&quot; and sought someone to lean on. [...] They were first of all Polish patriots who wanted to see a new Poland; and they were the only force we could rely on because of their attitude toward us, toward our Jewish group&quot;. Polish-Israeli historians Israel Gutman and Shmuel Krakowski report that in many regions of Poland, the People&#x27;s Guard was the only allied force the Jewish partisans could rely on, and list ten Jewish partisan units that joined the People&#x27;s Guard, alongside thirteen ethnically mixed partisan units of the People&#x27;s Guard. According to Dariusz Libionka, &quot;the fundamental difference between the AK Armia Krajowa] and GL-AL [Gwardia Ludowa-Armia Ludowa] with regard to their attitude towards Jews was that Jews could function in GL while retaining their identity, while in the AK they could not&quot;.

According to Shmuel Krakowski, the People&#x27;s Guard&#x27;s attitude towards the Jewish families hiding in the forests was not uniform. In the northern part of the Lublin region, local People&#x27;s Guard units helped Jewish partisans to protect a large camp of Jewish families in the Parczew forests. In the southern part of this region, however, Jews hiding in the forests were killed by a People&#x27;s Guard unit.

===Transformation===
On 1 January 1944, by a decree of the Krajowa Rada Narodowa, the communist government installed by Stalin, the Gwardia Ludowa became a part of the newly formed Armia Ludowa.

==Commanders==
The prominent commanders and GL chiefs of staff were Marian Spychalski, Franciszek Jóźwiak, Franciszek Zubrzycki, and Mieczysław Moczar who played a prominent role in the history of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic after the war&#x27;s end and was known for his ultra-nationalist and antisemitic attitude.

<doc id="1125298" wikidata="Q859024" url="?curid=1125298" title="Catching Up with Depeche Mode">
<text>Catching Up with Depeche Mode is a compilation album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released solely in North America on 11 November 1985 by Sire Records.

October 1985 saw the international release of the album &quot;The Singles 81→85&quot;, which collected the band&#x27;s seven-inch singles to that date. Sire Records felt a new album in North America would have to differ from this international release, since some of the band&#x27;s singles had already appeared on the compilation &quot;People Are People&quot; the previous year. Therefore, &quot;Catching Up with Depeche Mode&quot; omitted any of the band&#x27;s singles that were already available on &quot;People Are People&quot;, those songs being &quot;Leave in Silence&quot;, &quot;Get the Balance Right!&quot;, &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, and &quot;People Are People&quot;. To compensate, &quot;Catching Up with Depeche Mode&quot; includes &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot; and &quot;Somebody&quot;, as well as two B-sides, &quot;Flexible&quot; (from &quot;Shake the Disease&quot;) and &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; (from &quot;It&#x27;s Called a Heart&quot;). This version of &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; predates the final version that would later appear on Black Celebration.

&quot;Catching Up with Depeche Mode&quot; peaked at number 113 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart. On 2 August 2000, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

<doc id="1125312" wikidata="Q7858750" url="?curid=1125312" title="Two-second rule">
<text>The two-second rule is a rule of thumb by which a driver may maintain a safe trailing distance at any speed. The rule is that a driver should ideally stay at least two seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front of his or her vehicle. It is intended for automobiles, although its general principle applies to other types of vehicles. Some areas recommend a three-second rule instead of a two-second rule to give an additional buffer.

The rule is not a guide to safe &quot;stopping&quot; distance, it is more a guide to reaction times. The two-second rule tells a defensive driver the &quot;minimum&quot; distance needed to reduce the risk of collision under ideal driving conditions. The allotted two-seconds is a safety buffer, to allow the following driver time to respond. The practice has been shown to considerably reduce the risk of collision and also the severity of any injuries if a collision occurs. It also helps to avoid tailgating and road rage for all drivers.

A large risk of tailgating is the collision avoidance time being much less than the driver reaction time. Driving instructors advocate that drivers always use the &quot;two-second rule&quot; regardless of speed or the type of road. During adverse weather, downhill slopes, or hazardous conditions such as black ice, it is important to maintain an even greater distance.

==Application==

The two-second rule is useful as it can be applied to any speed. Drivers can find it difficult to estimate the correct distance from the car in front, let alone remember the stopping distances that are required for a given speed, or to compute the equation on the fly. The two-second rule provides a simpler way of perceiving the distance.

To estimate the time, a driver can wait until the rear end of the vehicle in front passes any distinct and fixed point on the roadway—e.g. a road sign, mailbox, line/crack/patch in the road. After the car ahead passes a given fixed point, the front of one&#x27;s car should pass the same point no less than two seconds later. If the elapsed time is less than this, one should increase the distance, then repeat the method again until the time is at least two seconds.

One can count the duration of time simply by saying &quot;zero... one... two&quot;. Some instructors suggest that drivers say &quot;only a fool breaks the two-second rule&quot;. At a normal speaking rate, this sentence takes approximately two seconds to say and serves as a reminder to the driver of the importance of the rule itself.

The TailGuardian distance advisory decals recently adopted by Stagecoach Buses in the UK use the two-second rule in their calibration. Advisory Decals for 30, 50 and 70 mph are calibrated to be invisible outside those safe distance, only rendering themselves visible once the car following has entered the safety zone for the speed that they are travelling.

==Three-second rules==
Some authorities regard two seconds as inadequate, and recommend a three-second rule. German law requires a minimum 0.9 second distance but when tested under relaxed conditions researchers found that their test subjects spent 41% of the test time at following distances under 0.9 seconds.

The United States National Safety Council suggests that a three-second rule—with increases of one second per factor of driving difficulty—is more appropriate. Factors that make driving more difficult include poor lighting conditions (dawn and dusk are the most common); inclement weather (ice, rain, snow, fog, etc.), adverse traffic mix (heavy vehicles, slow vehicles, impaired drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.), and personal condition (fatigue, sleepiness, drug-related loss of response time, distracting thoughts, etc.). For example, a fatigued driver piloting a car in rainy weather at dusk would do well to observe a six-second following distance, rather than the basic three-second gap.

<text>Alsace Grand Cru () is an Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée for wines made in specific parcels of the Alsace wine region of France. The Grand Cru AOC was recognized in 1975 by the INAO with subsequent expansion in 1983, 1992 and 2007.

The wines come from selected sites in the Alsace AOC region, located at altitudes between 200 m and 300 m. To qualify for Grand Cru status, a wine must first meet the &quot;Alsace AOC&quot; rules and then other strict requirements. For example, the yield of the vineyards has to be 55 hectoliters per hectare or less, the wine has to come from a single named vineyard (called a &quot;lieu-dit&quot; in Alsace) of Grand Cru status, and the name of the vineyard must be on the label.

As of 2018, 51 &quot;lieux-dits&quot; are listed as Grand Cru, the latest addition being Kaefferkopf of Ammerschwihr in January 2007.

==History==

===Middle Age===
In Alsace, the concept of cru vineyards came very early.

In 613, the king-to-be Dagobert gave vines on the Steinklotz to the abbey of Haslach.

In Rouffach in 762, Heddo, Archbishop of Strasbourg, founded the abbey of Ettenheim and made his income from the vines of the Vorbourg.

In Bennwihr in 777, the missi dominici passing through Alsace reported favorably to Charlemagne on the quality of &quot;Beno Villare&quot; (&quot;Beno&#x27;s domain&quot;) wines from the Marckrain.

In Sigolsheim, a charter of 783 notified that the Sigoltesberg vineyard (the current Mambourg) was the common property of the nearby lords and monasteries.

In Kintzheim in the 9th century, the Benedictine abbots of Ebersmunster owned vines on the Praelatenberg (&quot;Prelates hill&quot;). This lieu-dit has been farmed since 823.

In Dahlenheim and Scharrachbergheim, a charter declared a high quality vineyard of the Engelberg in 884.

In Wintzenheim in the 9th century, a gift from the abbey of Murbach cited the Hengst vineyard for the first time. The lords of Hohlandsbourg and the bailiff of Kayserberg shared its feudal rights until the French Revolution.

Between 1000 and the Renaissance, other Alsatian &quot;lieux-dits&quot; have been owned by the nobility or the clergy. The wealth of the Alsatian charter-binders formed the historical basis for the delimitation of the &quot;Alsace Grands Crus lieux-dits&quot;.

===Contemporary===
The Alsace wine region is distinct from other French wine regions.

After the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and the return of Alsace into France, German law in this previous Reichsland was largely retained as local law. This situation held up the recognition of Alsace wines.

A 1945 local ordinance designating the origin of Alsatian wines was used as the basis for the 1962 decree establishing the Alsace AOC. Neither the ordinance nor the decree contained a word about geographical designations or an allusion to &quot;crus&quot;.

The situation began to evolve with a decree in 1975 which created the designation &quot;Alsace Grand Cru&quot;. Its first article makes clear that wines have first to meet the &quot;Alsace AOC&quot; rules. Then, a decree in 1983 designated an additional 25 &quot;lieux-dits&quot;.

In 1985, the INAO agreed to an increase in the &quot;Alsace Grands Crus&quot; list. The same year, a decree added 25 new names.

In 1984, the Vendange Tardive and Sélection de Grains Nobles designations were introduced. In 1993, Rouffach was admitted in the Vorbourg &quot;lieu-dit.&quot; In 2001, the maximal yield was reduced. In 2005, exceptions to vine planting were allowed. The most recent additions were in 2007, bringing the total to 51 grand cru vineyards.

==Geography==
&quot;Alsace grands crus&quot; are produced in north-eastern France, in the region Alsace, on the territory of 47 communes (14 in Bas-Rhin and 33 in Haut-Rhin), from Marlenheim at northern end, westward from Strasbourg, to Thann at southern end, westward from Mulhouse.

=== Geology and orography ===
The Alsace plain occupies the south part of the Upper Rhine Plain, which formed from a collapse during the Oligocene and is followed since the Miocene by the river Rhine. The vineyard stays on the lower slopes of the Vosges Mountains, on the fault zone of the graben, covered by alluvial fans of the many rivers and creeks flowing from the nearby heights. This explains the variety of the subsurface materials and their succession forming a true mosaic: limestone, granite, shale, gneiss or sandstone.

Mainly, the upper part of the slopes of the sub-Vosge hills consists of old rocks: pluton and metamorphic rocks like granite, gneiss or slate. Vine-planted parcels are rather steep and climb up to 478 m height (near Osenbach).
The lower part of the slopes consists of layers of limestone or marl covered by loess where the slope is rather smooth.

The plain consists of a thick layer of alluvium deposited by the Rhine (silt and gravel). This zone is more fertile than the others, with an important aquifer close to the surface (less than 5 m deep): the Upper Rhine aquifer.

Such differences allow each Grand Cru to benefit from a particular terroir, even more differentiated by the climate.

=== Climatology ===

On the western side, the Vosges Mountains shield the Alsatian vineyards from wind and rain. Predominately western winds lose their moisture on the eastern side of the Vosges and arrive as Foehn winds into the Alsace plain. The precipitation mean in Alsace is the least of all French wine regions. Colmar is one of the driest cities in France.

Consequently, the climate is more temperate than expected at this latitude: the annual mean temperature is about 1.5 °C higher. The climate is semi-continental and dry with hot springs, sunny and dry summers, long autumns and cold winters.

Each of the &quot;Grands Crus&quot; benefits from a microclimate, inevitably different from place to place.

==Allowed varieties==
As of 2011, Alsace Grand Cru wines can only be produced using one of four white grape varieties: Riesling, Muscat, Pinot gris and Gewürztraminer. In 2006, Zotzenberg became the only Grand Cru vineyard that could produce wine from Sylvaner. Except for certain vineyards where blends are allowed, the wines must be exclusively made using a single variety and may be labelled as such. Late harvest wines must be labelled by grape variety. For Muscat-labelled wines, only one of the allowed Muscat varieties can be used (see table below).

===Vineyards where blends are allowed===
In some Grand Cru vineyards, blends are allowed, which may also include some non-noble grapes. In Alsace, blends have usually been associated with wines of lesser quality. The producer primarily associated with high-quality blends is Marcel Deiss.

==List of Alsace &quot;Grands Crus&quot;==
&quot;Grand Cru&quot; vineyards (&quot;lieux-dits&quot;) with their &quot;commune(s)&quot;/village(s), &quot;département&quot;, size and the date it was granted Grand Cru status. Where the same name is used for several vineyards, its official name is &quot;vineyard&quot; de &quot;village&quot;, such as Altenberg de Bergbieten, Altenberg de Bergheim or Altenberg de Wolxheim.

<doc id="1125337" wikidata="Q834455" url="?curid=1125337" title="List of common Chinese surnames">
<text>These are lists of the most common Chinese surnames in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Hong Kong, Macau, and Mainland China), the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the Chinese diaspora overseas as provided by government or academic sources. Chinese names also form the basis for many common Cambodian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames, and to an extent, Filipino surnames in both translation and transliteration into those languages.

The conception of China as consisting of the &quot;old hundred families&quot; () is an ancient and traditional one, the most notable tally being the Song-era &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; (). Even today, the number of surnames in China is a little over 4,000, while the year 2000 United States census found there are more than 6.2 million surnames altogether and that the number of surnames held by 100 or more Americans (per name) was just over 150,000.

The Chinese expression &quot;Three Zhang Four Li&quot; () is used to mean &quot;anyone&quot; or &quot;everyone&quot;, but the most common surnames are currently Wang in mainland China and Chen in Taiwan. A commonly cited factoid from the 1990 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; estimated that Zhang was the most common surname in the world, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have not repeated the claim. However, Zhang Wei (张伟) is the most common &quot;full&quot; name in mainland China.

The top five surnames in China – Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu, Chen – are also the top five surnames in the world, each with over 70-100 million worldwide.

==Greater China==
===China===
This list of the 100 most common Chinese surnames derives from China&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security&#x27;s annual report on the top 100 surnames in China, with the latest report release in January 2020 for the year 2019. When the 1982 Chinese census was first published, it did not include a list of top surnames. However, in 2004, the State Post Bureau subsequently used the census data to release a series of commemorative stamps in honor of the then-most-common surnames in 2004.

The summary of the 2007 survey revealed China had approximately 92,881,000 Wangs (7.25% of the population), 92,074,000 Lees (7.19%), and 87,502,000 Zhangs (6.83%).

A 2018 survey showed that Liu and Chen were the next most common China with more than 70 million each.

These top five surnames – Wang, Lee(Li), Zhang, Liu, Chen – alone accounted for more people than Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world,

The next five – Yang, Huang, Zhao, Wu, and Zhou – were each shared by more than 20 million Chinese. Twelve moreXu, Sun, Ma, Zhu, Hu, Guo, He, Gao, Lin, Luo, Zheng, and Liangwere each shared by more than 10 million.

All together, the top hundred surnames accounted for 84.77% of China&#x27;s population.

===400 character list===
In 2013 the Fuxi Institution compiled a ranking of the 400 most common surnames in China.
===Taiwan===

According to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s Department of Population in 2016, Taiwan has only 1,503 surnames. The top ten surnames in Taiwan accounted for 52.77% of the general population, and the top 100 accounted for 96.56%.

;Other surveys

:* 1994–2011: The American researcher Chih-Hao Tsai has compiled unauthoritative annual surveys of the most common surnames on Taiwan based on published lists of all successful applicants taking Taiwan&#x27;s Joint College Entrance Exam. The test was mandatory for college entrance until 2002 and is still quite common, with more than a hundred thousand successful applicants a year and a pass rate for all test takers between 60 and 90%.

== Philippines ==
Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have single syllable Chinese surnames. On the other hand, most who have Chinese ancestors who came to the Philippines prior to 1898 usually have multiple-syllable Chinese surnames such as Gokongwei, Ongpin, Pempengco, Yuchengco, Teehankee, and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated in Spanish orthography and adopted as surnames.

Common Chinese Filipino surnames are: Tan/Chan (陳/陈), Dy/Dee/Lee/Li (李), Sy/See/Siy/Sze (施), Lim/Lam (林), Chua/Choa/Choi (蔡), Yap/Ip (葉/叶), Co/Ko/Kho (許/许), Ko/Gao/Caw (高), Ho/Haw/Hau/Caw (侯), Cua/Kua/Co/Kho/Ko (柯), Coo/Khoo/Kho/Cu/Kuh (邱), Go/Ngo/Wu (吳/吴), Ong/Wong (王), Ang/Hong/Hung (洪), Lao (劉/刘), Tiu/Cheung (張/张), Yu/Young (楊/杨), Auyong/Awyoung (歐陽/欧阳), Ng/Uy/Wee/Hong/Wong/Huang (黃), Tiu/Chiu/Chio/Chu (趙/赵), Chu/Chiu/Chow (周), King (龔), Chan (曾), Ty/Tee (鄭/郑), Ching/Cheng/Chong (莊/庄), Que/Cue/Kwok (郭), Leong/Liong/Leung (梁), etc.

There are also multiple-syllable Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandson, 大孫), Dizon (Second Grandson, 二孫), Samson/Sanson (Third Grandson, 三孫), Sison (Fourth Grandson, 四孫), Guzon/Gozum/Gozon/Goson (Fifth Grandson, 五孫), Lacson (Sixth Grandson, 六孫), Tecson/Ticzon/Tiongson/Teoxon (Seventh Grandson, 德孫/提克宗/頂客/东阳顺), Sioson (Eighth Grandson, 西奥森) and Hizon (Ninth Grandson, 希森) are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son (孫) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. The surname &quot;Son/Sun&quot; (孫) is listed in the classic Chinese text &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot;, perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.

==Canada==
Statistics Canada has not released a list of common surnames for any of its recent censuses, but much of the Canadian Chinese population is clustered in Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria in British Columbia and the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and the Ottawa-Gatineau Area in Ontario, as well as in some emerging major clusters, such as the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor in Alberta, Montreal, and the Communauté métropolitaine de Québec (Quebec Community Metropolitan Area) in Quebec.

===Ontario===
A 2010 study by Baiju Shah &amp; al data-mined the Registered Persons Database of Canadian health card recipients in the province of Ontario for a particularly Chinese-Canadian name list. Ignoring potentially non-Chinese spellings such as Lee (49,898 total), they found that the most common Chinese names in Ontario were:

==Indonesia==
Nearly as large is the Chinese Indonesian community. The 2010 Indonesian census reported more than 2.8 million self-identified Chinese, or about 1% of the general population. Just as in Thailand, though, previous legislation (in this case, 127/U/Kep/12/1966) had banned ethnic Chinese surnames throughout the country. This law was abolished after the removal of Suharto, but Chinese Indonesian names remain a mix of Indonesian, pinyin, peh-oe-ji, and Dutch-spelled Hokkien.

==Malaysia==
During the 2010 Malaysian Census, there were approximately 6,960,000 Malaysians of Chinese ethnicity. The Chinese are the second largest ethnicity in Malaysia, after the Malays.

==Singapore==

Ethnic Chinese make up almost three-fourths (2009) of Singapore&#x27;s resident population of nearly four million (2011).

=== 2000 ===
According to Statistics Singapore, as of the year 2000, the most common Chinese Singaporean names were:
* As most Singaporeans of Chinese descent have ancestors which originated from Southern China, mainly from Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan, the distribution of surnames in Singapore is quite different from that of Mainland China.
* As there are a variety of dialect groups in Singapore, the same surname in Chinese characters may be romanised in several different ways in Singapore. Some less common Chinese transcriptions of the 20 most common romanised surnames may not be listed in the table above.

=== Newer version ===
There is a newer list of most common surnames in Singapore from an unknown year. Some numbers are missing as the original list contains several non-Chinese surnames, which have been excluded from the table below.

==Thailand==
The largest Chinese diaspora community in the world are the Chinese Thais (or Sino-Thais), who make up 12–14% of the total Thai population. However, very few Chinese Thais have Chinese surnames, after the 1913 Surname Act that required the adoption of Thai surnames in order to enjoy Thai citizenship. Moreover, the same law requires that those possessing the same surname be related, meaning that immigrant Chinese may not adopt the surname of their clansmen unless they can show actual kinship.

==United States==
The 2010 US Census found 3,794,673 self-identified Chinese Americans and 230,382 self-identified Taiwanese Americans, up from 2,734,841 Chinese Americans and 144,795 Taiwanese Americans in 2000.

Although the Chinese make up the largest segment of the U.S. Asian and Pacific Islander population, the most common Chinese-derived surname during the 2000 census was not itself Chinese but the Vietnamese Nguyễn (Chinese: , &quot;Ruǎn&quot;).

During the 2000 census, the 10 most common Chinese American names were:

:* 2002: study by Matthew Falkenstein, data-mining the 2000 US Census for a particularly Asian &amp; Pacific Islander name list, omitting those like Lee that are common among other ethnicities
:* 2000: study by Diane Lauderdale, &quot;et al.&quot;, data-mining Social Security card applications by persons born abroad before 1941 for a particularly Chinese-American name list

<text>Area codes 561 and 728 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Palm Beach County in the U.S. state of Florida. 561 was created on May 13, 1996, in a split of area code 407. The numbering plan area (NPA) comprises nearly every major city in the county, the largest of which being West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Wellington, Boynton Beach, Jupiter, Delray Beach, and Belle Glade. On March 10, 2023, area code 728 was added to the same numbering plan area to form an all-services distributed overlay.

Within only five years of creation, NPA 561 was experiencing rapid exhaustion of central office codes from growth of service demands in the Palm Beaches/Treasure Coast region and the proliferation of cell phones. In mitigation, the northern part of 561, the Treasure Coast, was split off with area code 772 in 2002. This service configuration in the region was sufficient for twenty-one years until on January 4, 2022, the Florida Public Service Commission decided and approved an all-services overlay for the NPA, with an effective in-service date of March 10, 2023.

A permissive dialing period was not necessary for this overlay, because area code 561 already had a ten-digit dialing requirement, because prior to October 2021, it had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code transitioned to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

<text>A continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is a continuous stochastic process in which, for each state, the process will change state according to an exponential random variable and then move to a different state as specified by the probabilities of a stochastic matrix. An equivalent formulation describes the process as changing state according to the least value of a set of exponential random variables, one for each possible state it can move to, with the parameters determined by the current state.

An example of a CTMC with three states formula_1 is as follows: the process makes a transition after the amount of time specified by the holding time—an exponential random variable formula_2, where &quot;i&quot; is its current state. Each random variable is independent and such that formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5. When a transition is to be made, the process moves according to the jump chain, a discrete-time Markov chain with stochastic matrix:
:formula_6

Equivalently, by the property of competing exponentials, this CTMC changes state from state &quot;i&quot; according to the minimum of two random variables, which are independent and such that formula_7 for formula_8 where the parameters are given by the Q-matrix formula_9
:formula_10
Each non-diagonal entry formula_11 can be computed as the probability that the jump chain moves from state &quot;i&quot; to state &quot;j&quot;, divided by the expected holding time of state &quot;i&quot;. The diagonal entries are chosen so that each row sums to 0.

A CTMC satisfies the Markov property, that its behavior depends only on its current state and not on its past behavior, due to the memorylessness of the exponential distribution and of discrete-time Markov chains.

==Definition==
Let formula_12 be a probability space, let formula_13 be a countable nonempty set, and let formula_14 (formula_15 for &quot;time&quot;). Equip formula_13 with the discrete metric, so that we can make sense of right continuity of functions formula_17. A continuous-time Markov chain is defined by:
* A probability vector formula_18 on formula_13 (which below we will interpret as the &quot;initial distribution&quot; of the Markov chain), and
* A rate matrix formula_20 on formula_13, that is, a function formula_22 such that
# for all distinct formula_23,
# for all formula_24 formula_25 (Even if formula_26 is infinite, this sum is &quot;a priori&quot; well defined (possibly equalling formula_27) because each term appearing in the sum is nonnegative. &quot;A posteriori&quot;, we know the sum must also be finite (not equal to formula_27), since we&#x27;re assuming it&#x27;s equal to formula_29 and we&#x27;ve assumed formula_20 is real valued. Some authors instead use a definition that&#x27;s word-for-word the same except for a modified stipulation formula_31, and say formula_20 is &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;totally stable&quot; to mean formula_33, i.e., every entry is real valued.)
Note that the row sums of formula_20 are 0: formula_35 or more succinctly, formula_36. This situation contrasts with the situation for discrete-time Markov chains, where all row sums of the transition matrix equal unity.

Now, let formula_37 such that formula_38 is formula_39-measurable. There are three equivalent ways to define formula_40 being &quot;Markov with initial distribution formula_18 and rate matrix formula_20&quot;: via transition probabilities or via the jump chain and holding times.

As a prelude to a transition-probability definition, we first motivate the definition of a &quot;regular&quot; rate matrix. We will use the transition-rate matrix formula_20 to specify the dynamics of the Markov chain by means of generating a collection of &quot;transition matrices&quot; formula_44 on formula_13 (formula_46), via the following theorem.

We say formula_20 is &quot;regular&quot; to mean that we do have uniqueness for the above system, i.e., that there exists exactly one solution. We say formula_20 is &quot;irregular&quot; to mean formula_20 is not regular. If formula_13 is finite, then there is exactly one solution, namely formula_51 and hence formula_20 is regular. Otherwise, formula_13 is infinite, and there exist irregular transition-rate matrices on formula_13. If formula_20 is regular, then for the unique solution formula_56, for each formula_57, formula_44 will be a stochastic matrix. We will assume formula_20 is regular from the beginning of the following subsection up through the end of this section, even though it is conventional to not include this assumption. (Note for the expert: thus we are not defining continuous-time Markov chains in general but only &quot;non-explosive&quot; continuous-time Markov chains.)

=== Transition-probability definition ===
Let formula_56 be the (unique) solution of the system (). (Uniqueness guaranteed by our assumption that formula_20 is regular.) We say formula_40 is &quot;Markov with initial distribution formula_18 and rate matrix formula_20&quot; to mean: for any nonnegative integer formula_65, for all formula_66 such that formula_67 for all formula_68
=i_{n+1})=\lambda_{i_0}\prod_{k\in\mathbb Z:0\le k\le n}P(t_{k+1}-t_k)_{i_k,i_{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;.|}}
Using induction and the fact that formula_69 we can show the equivalence of the above statement containing () and the following statement: for all formula_70 and for any nonnegative integer formula_65, for all formula_66 such that formula_67 for all formula_74 such that formula_75 (it follows that formula_76),
=i_{n+1}\mid X_{t_n}=i_n,\dots,X_{t_0}=i_0)=P(t_{n+1}-t_n)_{i_n,i_{n+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

It follows from continuity of the functions formula_77 (formula_78) that the trajectory formula_79 is almost surely right continuous (with respect to the discrete metric on formula_13): there exists a formula_81-null set formula_82 such that formula_83.

=== Jump-chain/holding-time definition ===
==== Sequences associated to a right-continuous function ====
Let formula_84 be right continuous (when we equip formula_13 with the discrete metric). Define

:formula_86
let 
:formula_87 
be the &quot;holding-time sequence&quot; associated to formula_88, choose formula_89 and let
:formula_90
be &quot;the &quot;state sequence&quot;&quot; associated to formula_88.

==== Definition of the jump matrix Π ====
The jump matrix formula_92, alternatively written formula_93 if we wish to emphasize the dependence on formula_20, is the matrix
formula_95
where formula_96 is the &quot;zero set&quot; of the function formula_97

==== Jump-chain/holding-time property ====
We say formula_40 is &quot;Markov with initial distribution formula_18 and rate matrix formula_20&quot; to mean: the trajectories of formula_40 are almost surely right continuous, let formula_88 be a modification of formula_40 to have (everywhere) right-continuous trajectories, formula_104 almost surely (note to experts: this condition says formula_40 is non-explosive), the state sequence formula_106 is a discrete-time Markov chain with initial distribution formula_18 (jump-chain property) and transition matrix formula_108 and formula_109 (holding-time property).

=== Infinitesimal definition ===

We say formula_40 is &quot;Markov with initial distribution formula_18 and rate matrix formula_20&quot; to mean: for all formula_24 formula_114 and for all formula_115, for all formula_116 and for small strictly positive values of formula_117, the following holds for all formula_57 such that formula_119:
:formula_120,
where the term formula_121 is formula_122 if formula_123 and otherwise formula_124, and the little-o term formula_125 depends in a certain way on formula_126.

The above equation shows that formula_11 can be seen as measuring how quickly the transition from formula_128 to formula_129 happens for formula_8, and how quickly the transition away from formula_128 happens for formula_132.

==Properties==

===Communicating classes===
Communicating classes, transience, recurrence and positive and null recurrence are defined identically as for discrete-time Markov chains.

===Transient behaviour===
Write P(&quot;t&quot;) for the matrix with entries &quot;p&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = P(&quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; = &quot;j&quot; | &quot;X&quot;0 = &quot;i&quot;). Then the matrix P(&quot;t&quot;) satisfies the forward equation, a first-order differential equation
:formula_133,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to &quot;t&quot;. The solution to this equation is given by a matrix exponential
:formula_134.

In a simple case such as a CTMC on the state space {1,2}. The general &quot;Q&quot; matrix for such a process is the following 2 × 2 matrix with &quot;α&quot;,&quot;β&quot; &gt; 0
:formula_135

The above relation for forward matrix can be solved explicitly in this case to give
:formula_136.

Computing direct solutions is complicated in larger matrices. The fact that &quot;Q&quot; is the generator for a semigroup of matrices
:formula_137
is used.

===Stationary distribution===
The stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of &quot;t&quot;. Observe that for the two-state process considered earlier with P(&quot;t&quot;) given by
:formula_136,
as &quot;t&quot; → ∞ the distribution tends to
:formula_139.
Observe that each row has the same distribution as this does not depend on starting state. The row vector &quot;&quot; may be found by solving
:formula_140
with the constraint
:formula_141.

====Example 1====

The image to the right describes a continuous-time Markov chain with state-space {Bull market, Bear market, Stagnant market} and transition-rate matrix
:: formula_142
The stationary distribution of this chain can be found by solving formula_143, subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1 to obtain
:formula_144 

====Example 2====

The image to the right describes a discrete-time Markov chain modeling Pac-Man with state-space {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the ghosts move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions. Entries with probability zero are removed in the following transition-rate matrix:

formula_145

This Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the ghosts can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving formula_143, subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is formula_147
The central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.

===Time reversal===
For a CTMC &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot;, the time-reversed process is defined to be formula_148. By Kelly&#x27;s lemma this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.

A chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. Kolmogorov&#x27;s criterion states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.

=== Embedded Markov chain ===

One method of finding the stationary probability distribution, , of an ergodic continuous-time Markov chain, &quot;Q&quot;, is by first finding its embedded Markov chain (EMC). Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, &quot;S&quot;, is denoted by &quot;s&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, and represents the conditional probability of transitioning from state &quot;i&quot; into state &quot;j&quot;. These conditional probabilities may be found by

:formula_149

From this, &quot;S&quot; may be written as
:formula_150
where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix and diag(&quot;Q&quot;) is the diagonal matrix formed by selecting the main diagonal from the matrix &quot;Q&quot; and setting all other elements to zero.

To find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find formula_151 such that
:formula_152

with formula_151 being a row vector, such that all elements in formula_151 are greater than 0 and formula_155 = 1. From this, may be found as
:formula_156

(&quot;S&quot; may be periodic, even if &quot;Q&quot; is not. Once is found, it must be normalized to a unit vector.)

Another discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a δ-skeleton—the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing &quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at intervals of δ units of time. The random variables &quot;X&quot;(0), &quot;X&quot;(δ), &quot;X&quot;(2δ), ... give the sequence of states visited by the δ-skeleton.

<text>Martin James&quot;Boz&quot;Boorer (born 19 May 1962 in Edgware, Middlesex, England) is an English guitarist and producer. He founded the new wave rockabilly group the Polecats, and starting in 1991 had a 30-year collaboration with singer Morrissey as co-writer, guitarist and musical director. 

==Early life==
Boz Boorer fell in love with music at an early age. He decided to play an instrument when buying T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; at age nine: it &quot;basically made me want to be in a band, made me want to learn to play the guitar&quot;, which he did in 1974. The albums that impacted him the most in the 1970s during his formative years, were the Beatles&#x27;s &quot;White Album&quot;, Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, Faces&#x27;s &quot;Ooh La La&quot;, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, New York Dolls, the Sex Pistols, the Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; and Elvis Presley. Elvis&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; was influential in his love for rockabilly.

==The Polecats==
The band Cult Heroes was formed in 1977 by Tim Worman (known as Tim Polecat, vocalist), Boz Boorer (guitarist and vocalist), Phil Bloomberg (bassist), and Chris Hawkes (drummer). After finding much difficulty persuading promoters to book them on the rockabilly circuit with a name sounding &quot;too punk&quot;, they adopted Hawkes&#x27; suggested band name The Polecats. Hawkes later was replaced by Neil Rooney. Three years after forming, the band signed to the fledgling British rockabilly label Nervous Records, and released the single &quot;Rockabilly Guy&quot; in 1979.

By 1980, the Polecats had signed to Mercury Records. The same year, they released their most successful LP &quot;Polecats Are Go!&quot;. The band had UK chart success with a David Bowie cover &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot;, a reworking of &quot;Rockabilly Guy&quot;, and another cover version of the T.Rex song &quot;Jeepster&quot;. In 1983, they entered the charts in the United States with their song &quot;Make a Circuit with Me&quot;. Shortly after, John Buck replaced Neil Rooney on drums. Boorer left the group in the same year but in 1989 he led a Polecats reunion which produced a live album and a new studio set. Raucous Records released a compilation album of Boz Boorer&#x27;s work titled &quot;Between The Polecats&quot; in early 2001. The band tours when time permits, and the most recent gig was at The Hot Rod Hayride in Bisley, Surrey, UK, on 30 July 2016.

==Morrissey==
Boorer, along with guitarist Alain Whyte, joined Morrissey in 1991 when the singer assembled a new band tour in promotion of his album &quot;Kill Uncle&quot;. With Whyte, he is credited with successfully synthesizing jangle pop and American rockabilly to create a new sound for Morrissey that helped to revitalize his career. From 1991 through 2021, Boorer worked not only as one of Morrissey&#x27;s co-writers and guitarists but also as the band&#x27;s musical director.

In 1994, Boorer produced for the first time a record for Morrissey: it was for the single &quot;Interlude&quot;, a duet between Morrissey and Siouxsie Sioux, a one-off released under the banner of both artists. Boorer notably directed the strings section.

==Solo career and other work==

Boorer has released solo material between his recording and touring. In 2008, he released the album &quot;Miss Pearl&quot;. Besides having a solo career, writing and playing for Morrissey and touring occasionally with the Polecats, Boorer has worked with other artists, including Adam Ant, Kirsty MacColl, Joan Armatrading, Jools Holland, and Edwyn Collins. He was in Ant&#x27;s full time band in 1993-1994 for the &quot;Persuasion&quot; tour and the recording of the &quot;Wonderful&quot; album before being replaced by Kris Dollimore in 1995 due to Boorer&#x27;s commitments with Morrissey. He also worked with his wife&#x27;s band, the Shillelagh Sisters, between 1983 and 1998.

In 2009, Boorer produced the debut EP by Tiguana Bibles, &quot;Child of the Moon&quot;.

He and his wife own a studio in Portugal, Serra Vista Studio. In summer 2010, Boorer recorded, produced and mixed Portuguese garage/blues/rock band Murdering Tripping Blues&#x27; second album, &quot;Share the Fire&quot;.

In 2011, Happy Martyr was formed with rapper Alex Lusty. The plan was to record some acoustic, stripped-down hip-hop, which Boorer described as &quot;an MC fronting early Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;. The albums &quot;One Square Mile&quot; and &quot;Nothing Like Love&quot; were released in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

In August 2012, Boorer released his fourth solo album, &quot;Some of the Parts&quot;, and the single &quot;Slippery Forces&quot; on Fabrique Records. The song &quot;Saunders Ferry Lane&quot; features the vocals of James Maker. &quot;Sunday Morning Coming Down&quot; is a cover of the Kris Kristofferson song. John Moore of Black Box Recorder and the Jesus and Mary Chain appears as a special guest on diverse instruments.

In June 2014, Boorer teamed up with Art Brut singer Eddie Argos for a new solo single, &quot;Girl from Atlanta&quot;, which was included on his solo album &quot;Age of Boom&quot; in 2016 for Fabrique Records. The album included a track &quot;Le Stalker&quot; with vocals by Georgina Baillie.

==Personal life==
Boorer has been married to Lyn since 1981, and they have two daughters: Pearl-May and Billie-Rose.

<doc id="1125358" wikidata="Q679316" url="?curid=1125358" title="Leonard Calvert">
<text>Leonard Calvert ( – ) was the first proprietary governor of the Province of Maryland. He was the second son of The 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632), the first proprietor of Maryland. His elder brother Cecil (1605–1675), who inherited the colony and the title upon the death of their father George, April 15, 1632, appointed Leonard as governor of the Colony in his absence.

==Early life==
Leonard Calvert was born in England to George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore and his wife Anne Mynne, and was named in honor of his paternal grandfather, Leonard Calvert of Yorkshire.

==Colonisation of Newfoundland==
In 1625, when Calvert&#x27;s father was created Lord Baltimore and received letters patent for the creation of a Province of Avalon in the island of Newfoundland from James I of England, he relocated part of his newly converted Catholic family to Newfoundland.

Leonard Calvert accompanied his father to the new colony of Newfoundland in 1628. The colony ultimately failed due to disease, extreme cold, and attacks by the French, and the family returned to England. After a few years, Baltimore declared Avalon a failure and traveled to the Colony of Virginia, where he found the climate much more suitable and temperate, but was met with an unwelcome reception from the Virginians&#x27; government and ruling class.

==Establishment of Maryland==
In 1632, Baltimore returned to England, where he negotiated an additional patent for the colony of Maryland from King Charles I. However, before the papers could be executed, Baltimore died on April 15, 1632.

On June 20, 1632, Cecil, the second Lord Baltimore, received from the king the charter for the colony of Maryland that his father had negotiated. The charter consisted of 23 sections, but the most important conferred on Lord Baltimore and his heirs, besides the right of absolute ownership in the soil, certain powers, ecclesiastical as well as civil, resembling those possessed by the nobility of the Middle Ages. Leonard Calvert was appointed by his brother as the colony&#x27;s first governor.

===&quot;The Ark&quot; and &quot;The Dove&quot;===
Two vessels, &quot;The Ark&quot; and &quot;The Dove,&quot; carrying over 300 settlers, sailed from the harbour of Cowes, England, on November 22, 1633, arriving at just inside the huge harbor and bay (later to be named &quot;Hampton Roads&quot;) at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, between Cape Charles and Cape Henry and passed off &quot;Point Comfort&quot; at the mouths of the intersecting James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers, in the colony of Virginia on February 24, 1634 (also later the site of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach on the south side and Newport News and Hampton on the northern peninsula). After exploring the area, a few weeks later they sailed up the Potomac River, north of the Virginia shoreline and the southern border of their new colony and landed on the northern shore at Blakistone Island (later renamed St. Clement&#x27;s Island) on March 25, 1634, erected a large cross, gave thanks and celebrated a Mass with Fr Andrew White who had accompanied them (later to be celebrated as &quot;Maryland Day&quot;, an official state and local holiday). Two days later, on March 27, they returned further south down-river near the point where the Potomac meets the Bay at what is now St. Mary&#x27;s City, then the site of a Native American village of the Yaocomico branch of the Piscataway tribe, whom the paramount chief had moved away to accommodate the new English settlers, so as to take advantage of the trading opportunities of their more powerful technology: industries, weapons and implements, and they began the work of establishing a settlement there.

==Governor of Maryland==

Following his brother&#x27;s instructions, Leonard Calvert at first attempted to govern the country in an absolutist way, but in January 1635, he had to summon a colonial assembly, which became the foundation and first session of the modern General Assembly of Maryland, the third legislature to be established in the English colonies after the House of Burgesses in the Dominion of Virginia and the General Court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 1638, the Assembly forced him to govern according to the common law of England, and subsequently the right to initiate legislation passed to the new General Assembly, representing the common &quot;freeholders&quot; (owners of freehold property) as subjects of the Crown.

In 1638, Calvert seized a trading post at Kent Island established by the Virginian William Claiborne. In 1643, Governor Calvert went to England to discuss policies with his brother Lord Baltimore, the proprietor, leaving the affairs of the colony in charge of acting Governor Giles Brent, his brother-in-law (he had married Ann Brent, daughter of Richard Brent). Calvert returned to Maryland in 1644 with a new wife and children (William, born in 1643, and a daughter, Anne, born in 1644). That same year, Claiborne returned and led an uprising of Maryland Protestants against the Catholic Proprietor. Calvert was soon forced to flee southward to Virginia. He returned at the head of an armed force in 1646 and reasserted proprietarial rule.

Leonard Calvert died of an illness in the summer of 1647. Before he died, he wrote a will naming Margaret Brent (the sister of Giles and a future, historically famous planter, lawyer, and female advocate for women&#x27;s rights) as the executor of his estate. Calvert also named his friend and fellow passenger aboard &quot;The Ark&quot; and &quot;The Dove&quot;, Thomas Greene, as his successor to the governorship.

In 1890, the State of Maryland erected an obelisk monument to Calvert and his wife at Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City which had a historical district created to commemorate the colonial origins of the colony.

==Leonard Calvert&#x27;s lost grave==

The location of Leonard Calvert&#x27;s grave has been lost to history, but there is an effort underway to find it. Archeologists based in the Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City research complex believe that Leonard Calvert is buried somewhere in St. Inigoes, Maryland. The most likely spot has been narrowed down to somewhere on Webster Field, now a small U.S. Naval Aircraft facility located on the water on the Western side of St. Inigoes. Several archeological digs have been conducted but the supposed grave has not been discovered.

Members of the Calvert family in the settlement were known to be buried in lead coffins. It is not known if this is how Leonard Calvert was buried. His death, due to disease, happened suddenly and unexpectedly after a period of religious warfare had wracked the colony. Soon after his death, one of the first laws requiring religious tolerance was written and enacted in the colony, further codifying its original proprietarial mandate of religious tolerance and reestablishing peace.

<text>In Spanish-speaking cultures, a verbena is an agricultural show, modest amusement park, or dance party, especially one held at night. An old tradition, they usually take place after dark in summer. Nowadays, some major cities, such as Barcelona, host &quot;permanent&quot; &quot;verbenas&quot; (&quot;revetlla&quot; in Catalan); however, these have a less traditional character than those that appear for only a few days each year.

A large contemporary &quot;verbena&quot; features mechanical amusement rides, sideshow attractions, and usually some sort of gambling. Typical &quot;verbena&quot; food includes churros, ham, cheese, marzipan, candied egg yolks (&quot;yemas&quot;), candied quince (&quot;membrillo&quot;), and sugared fruits—though in recent years, modern junk foods have found their way into the mix. There are always alcoholic beverages—usually Spanish wine, sangría and lager beer.

There is usually music and dancing, either organized or spontaneously. In recent years, &quot;verbenas&quot; have incorporated recorded popular music, rock music, and even karaoke, but in Andalusia and even beyond, flamenco and other traditional music still dominate &quot;verbenas&quot;. When the musicians take a break, a runner carrying fireworks (&quot;toro de fuego&quot;) may dash into the crowd.

The word &quot;verbena&quot; comes without alteration from Latin. The term originally referred to the plant verbena, from which the term for a fair derives.

==Artistic representation ==
One of the most famous &quot;zarzuela&quot; (Spanish operetta) pieces in the &quot;género chico&quot; (&quot;smaller genre&quot;) is &quot;La Verbena de la Paloma&quot; (&quot;The Fair of the Dove&quot;), set at a &quot;verbena&quot; on the night of the Virgin of the Paloma, August 14; it was also made into a 1963 movie.

There is a 1939 film called &quot;Verbena Tragica&quot; (also known as &quot;Tragic Festival&quot;).

The song &quot;Verbena de San Cayetano&quot; celebrates a &quot;verbena&quot; in Madrid.

<text>Michael Kandel (born December 24, 1941, in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American translator and author of science fiction.

==Biography==

Kandel received a doctorate in Slavistics from Indiana University. His most recent position was editor at the Modern Language Association. Prior to that, at Harcourt, he edited (among others) Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s work.

Kandel is perhaps best known for his translations of the works of Stanisław Lem from Polish to English.

Recently he has also been translating works of other Polish science fiction authors, such as Jacek Dukaj, Tomasz Kołodziejczak, Marek Huberath and Andrzej Sapkowski. The quality of his translations is considered to be excellent; his skill is especially notable in the case of Lem&#x27;s writing, which makes heavy use of wordplay and other difficult-to-translate devices.

<text>Anthony Ernest Marsh (20 July 1931 – 7 May 2009) was a British racing driver from England. His Formula One career was short and unsuccessful, but he enjoyed great success in hillclimbing, winning the British Hill Climb Championship on a record six occasions.

Having begun his hillclimbing career in 1953 with a Cooper-JAP that had previously been driven by Peter Collins,
he won three successive championships in the car from 1955 to 1957. In the 1960s, he drove an ex-Formula One BRM for a time before constructing his own Marsh car. Inspired by Peter Westbury&#x27;s Ferguson P99, Marsh devised an unusual drivetrain which utilised four-wheel-drive while accelerating but rear-wheel-drive while cornering.

&quot;Once again Tony Marsh established himself in 1965 as &quot;King of the Hills&quot; by scoring Best Time of the Day at eight of the nine first championship climbs he entered, and setting new course records at Shelsley Walsh, Bouley Bay and Longleat.

After winning another hat-trick of championships between 1965 and 1967, Marsh sold his car and left motorsport to concentrate on his engineering and farming interests, but in 1986 he returned at the wheel of the March-based Rovercraft. In 1993, his co-driver Simon Law was killed in the car during the Brighton Speed Trials, a tragedy which affected Marsh considerably. He returned with the ex-David Render Toleman TG191 Cosworth DFL, taking the Gurston Top Six title that year, aged 62. He continued to compete in hillclimbs well into his seventies, driving on until 2008.

Marsh competed in circuit racing in his earlier years, driving in four Grands Prix, the last being the 1961 German Grand Prix in which he drove the Lotus 18 he also campaigned in hillclimbs.
He also drove in the 1960 Le Mans 24 Hours, sharing a Lotus Elite with John Wagstaff.

In 2007 Parley Books published his autobiography: &quot;Tony Marsh: The great all-rounder: In and out of motorsport&quot;.

Marsh was born in Stourbridge; he died aged 77 in May 2009 after having been admitted to hospital with breathing complications.

<doc id="1125378" wikidata="Q1662351" url="?curid=1125378" title="Lake Tikitapu">
<text>Lake Tikitapu, more commonly known as Blue Lake, is the smallest of four small lakes lying between Lake Rotorua and Lake Tarawera in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand. The other three are Lake Rotokakahi (Green Lake), Lake Ōkāreka, and Lake Ōkataina.

The lake is named in English for its stunning aqua blue colour, which can be attributed to the pumice and rhyolite that lies on the lake bed.

==Geography==
Lake Tikitapu is south-east of Rotorua over a saddle and surrounded by native forest covered hills. The lake has a mean autumn height of above sea level. The lake has a flat bed and, as a collapsed volcanic crater, it only has a maximum depth of . There are no permanent surface outflows and only a seep near the northern end may be a permanent inflow. The lake is in size, with a catchment size of 620 hectares, giving a modelled catchment precipitation inflow of .

===Geology===
Lake Tikitapu was formed as the result of a lava dam generated during the Rotoroa rhyolitic eruption sequence, at the south-western margins of the Ōkataina Caldera now dated at 15,635 ± 412 cal.yr BP, which separates it from Lake Rotokakahi to the south. The lake is closely related to the Ōkāreka Embayment on the western margins of the Ōkataina Caldera and it is possible that the Te Rere rhyolite eruption of 25,171 ± 964 years BP was also relevant to its formation.

== Activities and leisure ==
On the lake, swimming, boating, trout fishing and watersports are popular activities. Both rainbow trout and brook trout reside in the lake, making it very popular with experienced and recreational fishers.

Popular with both locals and visitors; walking and biking tracks surround the lake. The 5.5 km Blue Lake walking track circles the lake and weaves through native bush and exotic conifers of the Whakarewarewa Forest. The track comes to an end, reaching the beaches at the end of the lake. The track has been graded as easy, with the average walker taking an hour and thirty minutes to complete the track. The Tangaroamihi biking trail connects Lake Tikitapu to the Whakarewarewa Forest mountain bike trail network. It is a grade 2, 2.5 km trail.

The available facilities at Lake Tikitapu include BBQ&#x27;s and picnic tables, children&#x27;s playgrounds, ski lanes and boat ramps and public toilets, making it a popular choice for families.

Lake Tikitapu hosts numerous events throughout the year; these events range from rowing regattas, wakeboarding competitions, waka ama events and many more.
== History ==
Lake Tikitapu is immersed in Māori history. The name refers to a sacred greenstone, or pounamu, necklace that is believed to have been worn by a daughter of a high ranking chief. It is understood that the daughter lost the necklace as she bathed in the crystal waters.

New Zealand flatwater canoeist, Lisa Carrington, has competed in events numerous times at Blue Lake regattas. In 2018, she won all six of her events, and in 2020 Carrington won both the K1 (single kayak) 200m and K1 500m finals.

=== Legend of Kataore ===
Māori legend also surrounds the lake. Legend says that the Taniwha monster, named Kataore, lived in Lake Tikitapu. Kataore&#x27;s initial loveable nature had changed as he grew up, and he became a mischievous taniwha who preyed on lone travellers. He was known to devour unsuspecting travelers in one gulp.

Kataore&#x27;s actions were getting out of hand, and he soon felt the rage of the neighbouring tribes. Kataore later made a detrimental mistake; he swallowed the chief&#x27;s daughter, as she was on her way to be wed to a young chief, Reretoi. After hearing of this disaster, Reretoi assembled 140 bold warriors to seek revenge. Reretoi and his men managed to draw Kataore out of his cave and noose his neck, attack and slay him with tewhatewha and kotiate. Kataore&#x27;s body was stripped of his flesh, and his heart was eaten by the tohunga between the Blue and Green Lakes.

<doc id="1125389" wikidata="Q1933243" url="?curid=1125389" title="Mike Joyce (musician)">
<text>Michael Adrian Paul Joyce (born 1 June 1963) is an English drummer. He is best known for being the drummer for The Smiths from October 1982 to 1987.

==Career==
While the Smiths provided Joyce with his first taste of success, he had previously drummed for Manchester band The Hoax and Northern Irish punk rock group Victim. Immediately after the break-up of the band in 1987, Joyce and Smiths bassist Andy Rourke played with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. They, along with Craig Gannon, also provided the rhythm section for two singles by Smiths&#x27; singer Morrissey – &quot;Interesting Drug&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; and their B-sides. Work with Suede, Buzzcocks, Public Image Limited, Julian Cope, P. P. Arnold and Pete Wylie followed throughout the 1990s. Joyce, Rourke, and Gannon reunited to work on a project with fellow Manchester musician Aziz Ibrahim (formerly of the Stone Roses and Simply Red), ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead (as Moondog One), and Vinny Peculiar.

In July 2007, Joyce, along with Rourke released &quot;Inside The Smiths&quot;, a DVD which chronicled their experiences of being in the band. In October 2007, Joyce toured the UK playing drums for Vinny Peculiar with Bonehead (Oasis) on bass guitar, and in 2008 he presented the &quot;Alternative Therapy&quot; radio show on Revolution 96.2 FM at The Brickhouse until the station changed format, later reviving it on Manchester Radio Online and Tin Can Media. He hosts &quot;The Coalition Chart Show&quot; on East Village Radio, which streams from New York. In parallel to his music career, Joyce works as a DJ and broadcaster, including occasional appearances on BBC 6 Music. Joyce has hosted shows on East Village Radio, an internet station.

Since October 2017, Joyce has hosted a weekly radio show on Manchester radio station XS Manchester. In October 2018, the show was nominated in the &#x27;Best Specialist Music Show&#x27; category at the ARIAS 2018 radio awards. Joyce is a patron of the Manchester-based charity Back on Track; as part of this role, Joyce ran a special cooking session with some of the charity&#x27;s clients, during which they cooked vegetables from his allotment, and featured as a story on ITV Granada.

==Personal life==
Joyce was born in Manchester to Irish Catholic parents, and attended St Gregory&#x27;s Grammar School in the city. Joyce married Christina Riley in 1994. He is a vegetarian. Joyce is a Manchester City fan, and is sometimes interviewed at City Square before important home matches.

In 1996, Joyce sued former Smiths&#x27; colleagues Johnny Marr and Morrissey for an equal share of performance and recording royalties. Joyce won the case and was awarded damages of around £1 million from Morrissey and Marr. According to Morrissey, who unsuccessfully appealed Joyce&#x27;s claims, Joyce first sued Morrissey and Marr in 1989 for 25% of the Smiths&#x27; recording royalties. In 1996, Joyce won the case &quot;on the basis of the 1890 Partnership Act&quot;.

<doc id="1125402" wikidata="Q1496414" url="?curid=1125402" title="Höfner">
<text>Karl Höfner GmbH &amp; Co. KG is a German (originally Austro-Bohemian) manufacturer of musical instruments, with one division that manufactures guitars and basses, and another that manufactures other string instruments, such as violins, violas, cellos, double basses and bows for stringed instruments.

Much of Höfner&#x27;s popularity is attributed to Paul McCartney&#x27;s use of the Höfner 500/1 electric bass guitar throughout his career. This violin-shaped model is commonly referred to as the &quot;Beatle bass&quot;.

==Company history==

A German luthier, Karl Höfner (1864–1955), founded the Höfner company in the town of Schönbach in Austria-Hungary (now Luby in the Czech Republic) in 1887. He soon became the largest string instrument manufacturer in the country. His sons, Josef and Walter, joined the company around 1920, and began spreading the brand&#x27;s reputation worldwide. The company became involved in production for the German army in World War II producing wooden crates and soles for boots. After the war, Germans were expelled from the Sudetenland, forcing Höfner to move to West Germany. The company initially moved to an ex-work camp at Möhrendorf in 1948, but soon became involved in the development of a new township and factories in Bubenreuth. The new Höfner factory opened in 1950, and expanded three times between 1953 and 1960. Karl Höfner, the founder, lived to see the company&#x27;s revival, and died in Bubenreuth in 1955. In 1964, the company built a further factory at Hagenau, about 5 km from Bubenreuth, to machine wood parts for assembly at Bubenreuth. They expanded the Hagenau factory twice in the 1970s.

The daughter of Walter Höfner, Gerhilde, began working for the company in the mid-1950s taking an active part in all aspects of management. Her husband, Christian Benker, joined the company in 1963. They together became the driving force for the company as Josef and Walter entered retirement in the 1970s.

===Changes of ownership===
In 1994, Höfner became part of the Boosey &amp; Hawkes Group, and was able to expand and upgrade its facilities with the influx of cash. In 1997, the company moved from Bubenreuth to Hagenau.

After a near-bankruptcy in 2003 Boosey &amp; Hawkes sold its musical instrument division (including the Höfner and Buffet Crampon companies) to the Music Group, a company formed by rescue buyout specialists Rutland Fund Management, for £33.2 million.

Höfner remained a part of this conglomerate until December 2004, when the Music Group sold the company to Klaus Schöller who had been the general manager of Höfner for many years, with his wife Ulrike Schrimpff, the finance director at Höfner along with Rob Olsen and Graham Stockley who were USA and UK partners. Klaus Schöller and Ulrike Schrimpff remain as the owners of the business today.

=== Distribution ===

==== Europe ====
The Höfner company has nearly always been responsible for its own distribution within Europe. The exceptions to this have been:
* The Netherlands where the distributor in the 1950s and 1960s was the Van Wouw company (which closed in the 1970s)
* Spain where the distributor is Keller
* The United Kingdom, in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s Höfner instruments were distributed by Selmer of London (not to be confused with The Selmer Company). In the mid-1990s Höfner became part of the Boosey &amp; Hawkes Group and UK distribution was taken over by them until the sale of Höfner in 2004 when distribution switched to GNC, a company formed by Graham Stockley and Clive Guthrie. Today electric guitars are distributed by Barnes and Mullins while classical guitars and stringed instruments are still distributed by Clive Guthrie.

==== United States ====
EMMC based in NJ was the distributor for bass guitars for many years until Boosey &amp; Hawkes bought Höfner in 1994.

Boosey &amp; Hawkes took over distribution from 1995 to 2003. During these years the improvements of quality and brand exposure were significant. The overall bass and guitar lines were redesigned and new successful 6-string jazz guitar models were created and introduced in late 1999.

The Music Group, a Venture Capital Company took over Boosey &amp; Hawkes from 2003 until 2004 when the Höfner company was purchased via a management buyout.

In 2005, Höfner&#x27;s United States distribution was picked up by Classic Musical Instruments (CMI) in Kenosha, WI. CMI ceased trading in 2012 and distribution passed to Musical Distributors Group (MDG) in New Jersey. In late 2018 MDG merged with Adam Hall North America and is the current USA distributor.

Rob Olsen - 1998–current:
Rob Olsen worked at Boosey &amp; Hawkes as Höfner Product Manager in late 1998 and remains responsible for USA distribution for Adam Hall. He designed or co-designed, with Klaus Schoeller and Graham Stockley, many key Höfner models, managed overall quality, and increased visibility of the company (especially from 1998 to 2012). Rob Olsen era Höfner models include: HAS acoustic series, Jazzica Custom, Verythin Classic, The New President, The Vice President, Verythin Standard, The Chancellor, The Club Bass reissue, The 50th Anniversary Violin bass, Club 40 John Lennon limited edition, Violin finish guitars and basses, Colorama reissue, H5 jazz guitars and many others. Rob may be best known for creating the flagship Icon/Ignition series basses and guitars. He was responsible for negotiations and creation of the Ed Sullivan Series basses, Guitar Hero and Beatles Rockband connections.

Rob Olsen opened and managed the Höfner Custom Shop (still in operation), which produces special instruments and colors for shops and artists, including Wilco, Lenny Kravitz, Bruno Mars, Cheap Trick, Bon Jovi, Tesla, Sheryl Crow, and others. The most famous custom shop model may be the Paul McCartney Jubilee bass that Paul used for the Concert For The Queen in 2012, where Paul sported a painted in a transparent colored Union Jack flag custom shop bass.

Rob Olsen along with Graham Stockley in the U.K. (and later based in Germany at the Höfner workshop) were the key players in exposing and bringing the brand to desired status by creating quality features and models, artist- relations and signings of visible artists (officially with Paul McCartney), Cheap Trick, Bon Jovi, Tesla, Wilco and many others. They also achieved rapid dealer growth and the creation of the ad campaigns during the USA Höfner brand launch years.

==Notable Höfner users==

===Beatles===
Beatles guitarists George Harrison and John Lennon used Höfner electric guitars. Harrison used a President model and a Club 40 early on in his association with the group. Lennon&#x27;s first electric guitar was a Club 40 model that he purchased in 1959 from Hessy&#x27;s music store in Liverpool. He used this for about one year, then bought a Rickenbacker &quot;Capri&quot; model. The Club 40 was briefly loaned to Paul McCartney and then it was sold. The band&#x27;s original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe played a Höfner 500/5 Bass.

====Paul McCartney====

The company is most famous through its association with Beatles songwriter, singer, and instrumentalist Paul McCartney, who is a longtime user of the Höfner 500/1 model hollow-body electric bass, first manufactured in 1956.

McCartney played two left-handed 500/1 basses during most of the group&#x27;s career—a 1961 model with pickups mounted close together towards the neck, and a 1963 model, with the second pickup mounted closer to the bridge. McCartney used the 1961 bass until the recording of &quot;With The Beatles&quot; in late 1963, when he got his second 500/1. McCartney used his 1963 bass almost exclusively during The Beatles&#x27; touring career, using his 1961 bass (repaired and refinished in 1964) as a backup. By 1965 McCartney had begun using a Rickenbacker bass in the studio—but he did bring out his 1961 model for the &quot;Revolution&quot; promo film in 1968, and for the documentary &quot;Let It Be&quot; the following year. In 1972, the 1961 bass was stolen, and was only recovered in September 2023. McCartney used his newer Höfner for the remainder of the film, including the famous rooftop performance. Though he continued to primarily use his Rickenbacker throughout the 1970s and 1980s, McCartney began using the 1963 Höfner extensively again on the 1989 album &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; and continues to use it to the present day.

<doc id="1125404" wikidata="Q766744" url="?curid=1125404" title="Music Man (company)">
<text>Music Man is an American guitar and bass guitar manufacturer. Originally formed in 1971 by Forrest White and Tom Walker, along with Leo Fender as a silent partner, the company started manufacturing electric and bass guitars under the Music Man name in 1974. In 1984 it was acquired by Ernie Ball, and renamed Ernie Ball Music Man.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1971, Forrest White and Tom Walker formed Tri-Sonix, Inc. Walker had previously been a sales representative at Fender. Walker approached Leo Fender about financial help in the founding. Because of a ten-year non-compete clause in the 1965 contract that sold the Fender companies to the CBS Corporation, Leo Fender became a silent partner.

White had worked with Leo Fender since 1954, in the very early days of the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company as the plant manager. Eventually, he became vice president, and stayed on after the company was sold to CBS, but grew unhappy with their management and resigned in 1966. Fender did not like the corporate name, so it changed first to Musitek, Inc., and in January 1974 the final name, Music Man, appeared. In 1974, the company started producing its first product, an amplifier designed by Leo Fender and Tom Walker called the &quot;Sixty Five,&quot; a hybrid of tube and solid-state technology. The number of designs rapidly increased, and 15 of the 28 pages from the 1976 catalogue were dedicated to amplification. 

In 1975, Fender&#x27;s legal restriction expired and, after a vote of the board, he was named the president of Music Man. Fender also operated a consulting firm, CLF Research, in Fullerton, California. By 1976, it had built a manufacturing facility for musical instruments and was contracted to make Music Man products. In June 1976, production started on guitars and in August basses followed. These instruments were designed by Fender and White. The 1976 catalogue shows the first offerings: a two-pickup guitar, the StingRay 1, and the StingRay bass. Both instruments featured bolt-on neck designs. The basses featured a distinctive 3+1 tuner arrangement to help eliminate &quot;dead spots,&quot; while the guitars came with a traditional, Fender-style 6-on-a-side tuner array. The StingRay Bass featured a single large humbucking pickup (located somewhat toward but not adjacent to the bridge) with a two-band fixed-frequency EQ. A row of string mutes sat on the bridge. Basses were produced in fretted and fretless versions.

Tom Walker played a large part in the design of the bass preamp. They were the first production guitar and basses to use active electronics which could boost levels in selected frequency bands. The preamps were coated with epoxy to prevent reverse engineering. The StingRay Bass sold well, but the guitar met with little success. In December 1978, a two-pickup bass was introduced called the Sabre (discontinued in 1991). A redesigned guitar bearing the same name followed. Both sold poorly.

===Departure of Fender===
 CLF Research and Music Man were treated as separate companies. CLF was headed by Fender, while White and Walker headed Music Man. Fender made the guitars and basses, while White and Walker&#x27;s company made the amplifiers and sold accessories. The instruments were made at CLF and shipped to the Music Man warehouse, where each instrument was inspected and tested. Problems with fibers in the finish caused Music Man&#x27;s inspectors to reject a high percentage of the instruments, and return them to CLF for refinishing. Since Music Man did not pay CLF Research until the instrument finishes were deemed acceptable, a rift developed between CLF and Music Man over payment.

According to amp technician Kevin Nelson the rift culminated when it turned out that a whole batch of guitars was flawed, and when the neck was investigated, it was discovered that the whole batch had the truss rods mounted up side down. This eventually led to an office fist-fight between Tom Walker and Leo Fender over who was responsible for this error.

In November 1979, ties were cut with Leo Fender. Fender formed another company, partnering with former Fender company designer George Fullerton to form G&amp;L Musical Instruments. G&amp;L was incorporated in May 1980, although some early models with the moniker &quot;G&amp;L&quot; have body dates from March 1980. A contract was given to Grover Jackson to build bass bodies and assemble the instruments with CLF necks and the remaining CLF hardware. When CLF stopped making necks Jackson made those also. 

Given this climate, the StingRay guitar was quietly dropped from the line, while the Sabre guitar production continued until 1984. A graphite-neck StingRay Bass debuted in 1980. Fender had been opposed to the idea. The guitar was called the Cutlass (with a &#x27;Cutlass II&#x27; variant with two pickups) and had a neck made by Modulus and new translucent finishes. The new guitars were unable to turn the financial tide and by 1984 the company was near bankruptcy. Music Man was sold to Ernie Ball on March 7, 1984. Music Man&#x27;s remaining physical assets were sold on June 1, 1984. The production of amplifiers, which were manufactured at a separate factory, ceased.

=== Ernie Ball Music Man ===

Ernie Ball started producing a modern acoustic bass guitar in 1972 under the name Earthwood. Sterling Ball, Ernie&#x27;s son, was an acquaintance of Fender and helped beta-test early Music Man models. Sterling took control of the Ernie Ball company in 1974.

Under Sterling&#x27;s direction, Ernie Ball acquired Music Man. The deal included trademarks, inventory, and a warehouse, but no factory. A factory was built with the help of Dudley Gimpel, and instrument production began in 1985. The first Ernie Ball Music Man StingRay bass hit the market soon after.

Ernie Ball Music Man improved their visibility in the guitar market with a succession of new guitar models, which were largely player-endorsed. They also introduced a series of new electric bass models.

==Instruments==

Music Man introduced the Sterling bass as a smaller, lighter alternative to the StingRay in 1993. The Sterling also had a slimmer neck profile with 22 frets and a triple-coil pickup with a 3 way switch. The pickup could operate as a standard Humbucker in series and parallel mode and utilized a &quot;phantom-coil&quot; when in single coil mode.

2003 saw the introduction of the Music Man Bongo Bass, the result of a partnership with DesignworksUSA, a design firm better known for its work with BMW. This bass features a basswood body with &quot;moon&quot;-shaped inlays. It has a four-band active EQ powered by an 18V supply. The Bongo was made available with the choice of HS (humbucker/single-coil), HH (dual humbuckers), and H (single humbucker) pickup configurations. These pickup configurations were adopted on other Music Man models three years later, using a five-way pickup selector with coil-tap capabilities.
In 2009, Music Man introduced the Big Al bass, based on the Albert Lee signature guitar, with an 18V-powered 4-band EQ, active/passive switching, series/parallel pickup wiring and three single-coil pickups with neodymium magnets. In 2010, the &#x27;Big Al&#x27; bass came in a five-string version with the choice of H and SSS pickup configurations.

Introduced in 2018, the StingRay Special series includes revamped versions of the StingRay and StingRay 5 basses with new pickups and an 18-volt preamp.

=== Entry-level versions ===
In the late 1990s, demand for cheaper versions of Music Man instruments had increased, and other companies had begun to exploit this market gap by producing replica instruments in various East-Asian countries. Music Man responded by licensing its designs to HHI/Davitt &amp; Hanser, launching OLP (Officially Licensed Products) to give Music Man market coverage in this price point. This agreement continued until 2008.

As a replacement for the OLP instruments, the company developed an in-house line of guitars and basses. Initially branded as S.U.B. for &quot;Sport Utility Bass,&quot; this became the non-acronym &quot;SUB&quot; after two models of six-string guitar were launched. This mid-range line, with production cost one-third to one-half less than the &quot;standard&quot; Music Man instruments, was launched in 2003. Produced at the same facilities as the Music Man models, the major defining factors of the SUBs were a non-angled &quot;slab&quot; body finished with a textured (non-polished) paint, as well as necks with a matte painted back instead of the &quot;oil and wax&quot; finish applied to the higher-end models. Savings were realized largely from reduced production time, as opposed to cutting the quality of the wood, hardware, or electronics, allowing the SUB lines to achieve their price-point. The product was a success. The SUB models were eventually discontinued in September 2006. Sterling Ball commented that, due to the quickly growing $1,000+ segment of the guitar industry, there were fewer and fewer SUBs in production each year.
In 2009, as a replacement for the SUB line, Music Man licensed Praxis Musical Instruments to build a new import budget brand, Sterling by Music Man. In 2012, Praxis expanded this line with the &quot;Sterling By Music Man SUB Series&quot; to compete with other sub-$300 USD &quot;beginner&quot; instruments. They were produced in Indonesia and other Far East countries using &quot;non-standard&quot; woods (i.e. not typically thought of as &quot;tonewoods&quot;) to keep production costs low. 

=== Signature models ===
In March 2016, Ernie Ball announced that St. Vincent had designed a signature Music Man guitar. It was originally released as the St. Vincent HHH signature model with three mini-humbuckers in a signature Vincent Blue finish, a paint color which Clark herself had personally hand-mixed and selected, as well as in black. A St. Vincent HH signature model was released in 2018 featuring two humbuckers in place of the three mini-humbuckers on the original. In 2021, a new St. Vincent Goldie signature model was released, featuring three gold foil mini-humbucker pickups, a reverse matching finish headstock, redesigned pickguard shape in 3-ply parchment, a roasted maple neck, and stainless steel frets.

The Mariposa model was launched in 2019 with Omar Rodríguez-López. It has an okoume body in an angular shape with a laser-etched floral pickguard, and two custom humbuckers featuring two volume knobs with a tethered tone circuit, which creates variations in treble response when the pickups are set at different levels.

In 2022, the Kaizen model was launched in collaboration with Tosin Abasi, a multi-scale 6- or 7-string guitar with an “infinity radius” fingerboard and Heat Treated humbuckers.

In 2025, the Stingray II model was introduced in collaboration with Cory Wong, a variation of the classic Stingray bass design but in electric guitar form. It features an ergonomic redesigned body, and signature Cory Wong HT humbucker pickups.

<doc id="1125408" wikidata="Q1146039" url="?curid=1125408" title="Milwaukee metropolitan area">
<text>The Milwaukee metropolitan area (also known as Metro Milwaukee or Greater Milwaukee) is a major metropolitan area located in Southeastern Wisconsin, consisting of the city of Milwaukee and some of the surrounding area. There are several definitions of the area, including the Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis metropolitan area and the Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha combined statistical area. It is the largest metropolitan area in Wisconsin, and the 39th largest metropolitan area in the United States.

==Definitions==
===Metropolitan area===
The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Milwaukee Metropolitan area as containing four counties in southeastern Wisconsin: Milwaukee and the three WOW counties: Ozaukee, Washington, and Waukesha. The Metropolitan population of Milwaukee was 1,575,179 in the Census Bureau&#x27;s 2019 estimate, making it the 39th largest in the United States.

The city of Milwaukee is the hub of the metropolitan area. The eastern parts of Racine County, eastern parts of Waukesha County, southern part of Ozaukee County, southeastern part of Washington County, and remainder of Milwaukee County are the most urbanized parts of the outlying counties.

The character of the area varies widely. Mequon, Brookfield, and the North Shore (Fox Point, Whitefish Bay, River Hills, Shorewood, Glendale, and Bayside) are more white-collar, while West Milwaukee, West Allis, and St. Francis are more blue-collar.

Metro Milwaukee draws commuters from outlying areas such as Madison, Chicago and the Fox Cities.
It is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis containing an estimated 54 million people.

===Combined statistical area===
The Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Combined Statistical Area is made up of the Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis Metropolitan Statistical Area (Milwaukee, Waukesha, Washington and Ozaukee counties), the Racine Metropolitan Statistical Area (Racine County), the Beaver Dam Micropolitan Statistical Area (Dodge County), the Watertown-Fort Atkinson Micropolitan Area (Jefferson County), and the Whitewater-Elkorn Micropolitan Area (Walworth County) according to the U.S. Census. Updated definitions released in February 2013 added Dodge, Jefferson and Walworth Counties to the Milwaukee CSA. Kenosha, despite being just 32 miles from Milwaukee and 50 miles from Chicago, is included as part of the Chicago CSA, as Kenosha has more residents who commute to the Chicago area. As of the 2019 census estimates, the Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Combined Statistical Area population was 2,047,966, the largest in Wisconsin and the 33rd largest in the United States. The Milwaukee-Racine-Waukesha CSA shares an eastern border with the Madison MSA the Janesville-Beloit MSA which in turn are both a part of the Madison CSA.

== Counties ==
There are eight counties in the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s Milwaukee–Racine–Waukesha Combined statistical area. 
* Dodge
* Jefferson
* Milwaukee
* Ozaukee
* Racine

== Debate over metropolitan government ==

Although each county and its various municipalities are self-governing, there is some cooperation in the metropolitan area. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) is a state-chartered government agency which serves 28 municipalities in the five counties.

At the same time, some in the area see the need for more consolidation in government services. The Kettl Commission and former Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum have supported initiatives to do this. However, full consolidation has faced unsubstantiated criticism as a means of diluting minority voting power.

<doc id="1125409" wikidata="Q721684" url="?curid=1125409" title="Walter Afanasieff">
<text>Walter Afanasieff (born Vladimir Nikitich Afanasyev; February 10, 1958), formerly nicknamed Baby Love in the 1980s, is an American record producer and songwriter. He was a frequent collaborator of Mariah Carey on her first six studio albums. Afanasieff and Carey co-wrote many songs together, including the number-one singles &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, and &quot;My All&quot;. He won the 1999 Grammy Award in the Record of the Year category for producing &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; by Celine Dion, and the 2000 Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical.

== Personal life ==
Afanasieff was born in São Paulo, Brazil. His father was Russian, while his mother, who was from Harbin, China, was of Russian-Chinese descent. When Afanasieff was four or five, his family moved to the United States.

== Career ==
Starting out as a working jazz musician in 1980, Afanasieff initially played keyboards with the jazz/fusion violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. Later, he formed The Warriors with another former Ponty sideman, guitarist Joaquin Lievano, and with 1980s music producer/songwriter and drummer Narada Michael Walden, and these experiences gave him the background and confidence to take an active role as a producer.

Walden hired Afanasieff as a staff producer/arranger and began using him as a keyboardist on Whitney Houston&#x27;s self-titled debut album released in 1985, which went on to become the artist&#x27;s best-selling studio album to date. It was also during this time that Afanasieff and Walden began writing pop songs together. Together with his mentor Narada, Afanasieff&#x27;s first major production was the title track of the James Bond movie &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, sung by Gladys Knight and co-written by Afanasieff and Walden.

One of Afanasieff&#x27;s biggest hits as a producer was &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, the theme tune to the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;, sung by Celine Dion. The song became the world&#x27;s best-selling single of 1998. Afanasieff produced and arranged other motion picture soundtracks, including Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson title-track duet), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (&quot;A Whole New World&quot;) and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (&quot;Someday&quot;). Afanasieff was also the producer and arranger for &quot;Go the Distance&quot;, the Oscar-nominated Michael Bolton song from the animated film &quot;Hercules&quot;.

Afanasieff performs on most of his recordings (mainly keyboards, synthesizers and drum programming).

Afanasieff created music with Mariah Carey from 1990 to 2001. He had a role in some of Carey&#x27;s most successful songs, including &quot;Hero&quot;, which he co-produced, co-wrote, and on which he played all of the music tracks. &quot;Hero&quot; was released as the second single from Carey&#x27;s album &quot;Music Box&quot;, and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on December 25, 1993. It remained at the top of the chart for four weeks. &quot;Hero&quot; has become one of Carey&#x27;s signature songs, and Carey closes many of her concerts with it. Carey and Afanasieff also wrote &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, a duet between Carey and Boyz II Men, which held the record for the longest run at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (16 weeks) for 23 years; the record was matched in 2017 by &quot;Despacito&quot;, and broken by &quot;Old Town Road&quot; in 2019. The song was nominated for the 1996 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, and received the ASCAP Song of the Year Award for 1996. In 1994, Carey released the Christmas song &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, composed by Afanasieff and herself. As of December 2018, the song has earned cumulative worldwide sales of over 14 million copies.

In 2009, Afanasieff started working with Russian singer Yulia Nachalova. Their album &quot;Wild Butterfly&quot; was released in 2012 on iTunes. They later produced a video &quot;Zhdi menya&quot; (&quot;Wait for Me&quot;) in Russian, released on iTunes in 2015.

In 2014, Afanasieff became head of the composers/producers department at Isina, a worldwide talent search and development mentorship for those seeking to pursue a career in music.

In 2015, he became one of the mentors of the Russian TV project &quot;Glavnaya Stsena&quot; (&quot;Main Stage&quot;), the Russian version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

<text>A one-act play is a play that has only one act, as distinct from plays that occur over several acts. One-act plays may consist of one or more scenes. The 20-40 minute play has emerged as a popular subgenre of the one-act play, especially in writing competitions. One act plays make up the overwhelming majority of fringe theatre shows including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

The origin of the one-act play may be traced to the very beginning of recorded Western drama: in ancient Greece, &quot;Cyclops&quot;, a satyr play by Euripides, is an early example. The satyr play was a farcical short work that came after a trilogy of multi-act serious drama plays. A few notable examples of one act plays emerged before the 19th century including various versions of the Everyman play and works by Moliere and Calderon. One act plays became more common in the 19th century and are now a standard part of repertory theatre and fringe festivals.

One act plays were very popular in the 20th century and it is regarded by many to be a modern product.

<text>Bore Head was one of Queensland&#x27;s best staying Thoroughbred racehorses with wins in five cups, the Ipswich, Queensland, Caulfield, Australian and Doomben.

He was a bay colt foaled in 1959 by Double Bore (GB), his dam, Mauna Kea was by Brimstone (GB). Bore Head&#x27;s half-brother Hillside, by Todman, was another useful galloper. Brother and sister Robert Chaplain and Carmel Burke owned Hillside and Bore Head, trained by D. Judd and Ron Dillon. 
Bore Head won the 1963 Queensland Cup with Fred Clarke in the saddle, carrying just 7 stone 1 pound, defeating Booberanna, 1964 Ipswich Cup (dead-heat with Isaacson), 1965 Caulfield Cup, 1965 QTC Moreton Handicap, 1965 QTC Sir Winston Churchill Stakes and in 1967 the Australian Cup and the Doomben Cup. He was placed in several other top staying races including the Brisbane Cup and Moonee Valley Cup (twice). After winning the Doomben Cup Bore Head had a further 31 race starts without a victory.

After winning the 1965 Caulfield Cup, many thought he stood a good chance in the Melbourne Cup of that year (won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings). But he lost his chance when the horse in front of him fell, taking Bore Head and another horse down in a three-horse tumble. Jockey Fred Clarke was convinced that Bore Head was on his way to winning the cup that day. The following year he placed twelfth in the race behind another Cummings-trained horse, Galilee.

<doc id="1125423" wikidata="Q32333487" url="?curid=1125423" title="Hip replacement">
<text>Hip replacement is a surgical procedure in which the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant, that is, a hip prosthesis. Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi/semi(half) replacement. Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted to relieve arthritis pain or in some hip fractures. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction varies widely between different techniques and implants. Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years. The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries.

==Medical uses==
Total hip replacement is most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget&#x27;s disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.

==Risks==
Risks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all joint replacements. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death. Weight loss surgery before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes.

Edema appears around the hip in the hours or days following the surgery. This swelling is typically at its maximum 7 days after the operation, then decreases and disappears over the course of weeks. Only 5% of patients still have swelling 6 months after the operation.

===Dislocation===

Dislocation (the ball coming out of the socket) is one of the most common complications. Hip prosthesis dislocation mostly occurs in the first three months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the cut tissue is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used. Surgeons who perform more operations tend to have fewer dislocations. Important factors which are related to dislocation are: component positioning, preservation of the gluteal muscles and restoration of leg length and femoral offset. Keeping the leg out of certain positions during the first few months after surgery further reduces risk.

Dislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles. Risk factors of late dislocation (after five years) mainly include:
* Female sex
* Younger age
* Previous subluxation without complete dislocation
* Previous trauma
* Substantial weight loss
* Recent onset or progression of dementia or a neurological disorder
* Malposition of the cup
* Liner wear, particularly when it allows head movement of more than 2 mm within the cup compared to its original position
* Prosthesis loosening with migration

=== Infection ===
Infection is one of the most common causes for revision of a total hip replacement. The incidence of infection in primary hip replacement is 1% or less in the United States. Risk factors for infection include obesity, diabetes, smoking, immunosuppressive medications or diseases, history of infection and previous hip surgery.

In revision surgery, infected tissue surrounding the joint is removed, and the artificial joint replaced. This can be carried out in one- or two-stage surgery. In two-stage surgery the infected tissue and all joint replacement implants are removed in the first stage, and, after the infection is completely cleared, a new artificial joint is inserted in the second stage. In one-stage surgery infected tissue and implants are removed, and the new joint inserted, in a single procedure. Both kinds of surgery are equally effective but one-stage surgery results in faster recovery.

===Limb length inequality===
Most adults have a limb length inequality of 0–2 cm which causes no deficits. It is common for people to sense a larger limb length inequality after total hip replacement. Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by six months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery (&lt;1 cm) to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than six months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction.

The perceived difference in limb length for a patient after surgery is a common cause for lawsuits against the healthcare provider.

===Fracture===

Intraoperative fractures may occur. After surgery, bones with internal fixation devices in situ are at risk of periprosthetic fractures at the end of the implant, an area of relative mechanical stress. Post-operative femoral fractures are graded by the Vancouver classification.

===Vein thrombosis===
Venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with anticoagulants is for 7–10 days; however, treatment for 21+ days may be superior. Extended-duration anticoagulants (up to 35 days following surgery) may prevent VTE in people undergoing hip replacement surgery. Other research suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so-called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, might only be necessary while in the hospital. Emerging evidence supports the use of aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Large randomised control trials suggested that aspirin is not inferior to low-molecular weight heparins and rivaroxaban. However, aspirin may not be appropriate in all cases, especially for patients who have additional risk factors for venous thromboembolisms or may have an inadequate response to aspirin.

Some physicians and patients may consider having an ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis after hip replacement. However, this kind of screening should only be done when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care.

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are sometimes used for prevention of blood clots following total hip replacement.

===Osteolysis===
Many long-term problems with hip replacements are the result of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body&#x27;s reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that wear off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. Ceramic bearing surfaces may eliminate the generation of wear particles. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. Highly cross-linked polyethylene plastic liners experience significantly reduced plastic wear debris. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses may not have long-term performance records. Ceramic piece breakage can lead to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of implants. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty can release metal debris into the body. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.

===Loosening===

On radiography, it is normal to see thin radiolucent areas of less than 2 mm around hip prosthesis components, or between a cement mantle and bone. These may indicate loosening of the prosthesis if they are new or changing, while areas greater than 2 mm may be harmless if they are stable. The most important prognostic factors of cemented cups are absence of radiolucent lines in DeLee and Charnley zone I, as well as adequate cement mantle thickness.

===Metal sensitivity===
Concerns were raised in the early 2000s regarding metal sensitivity and the potential dangers of metal particulate debris from hip prostheses, including the development of &quot;pseudotumors&quot;, soft tissue masses containing necrotic tissue, around the hip joint. It appears these masses were more common in women, and these patients showed a higher level of iron in the blood. The cause was then unknown, and was probably multifactorial. There may have been a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a &quot;normal&quot; amount of metal debris.

Metal hypersensitivity is a well-established phenomenon and is not uncommon, affecting about 10–15% of the population. Skin contact with certain metals can cause immune reactions such as hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although little is known about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products &quot;in vivo&quot;, there have been many reports of immunologic-type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components. Individual case reports link immune hypersensitivity reactions with adverse performance of metallic cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants.

===Metal toxicity===

Most hip replacements consist of cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel is no longer used. Any metal implant releases its constituent ions into the blood. Typically, these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of cobalt and chromium can be absorbed into the person&#x27;s bloodstream. There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement, particularly metal-on-metal hip replacements, which are no longer in use.

Use of metal-on-metal hip replacements from the 1970s was discontinued in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly after the discovery of aseptic lymphocyte-dominant vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL). However, the FDA&#x27;s 510k approval process allowed companies to have new and &quot;improved&quot; metal-on-metal hips approved without much clinical testing. Some people with these prostheses experienced similar reactions to the metal debris as occurred in the 20th century; some devices were recalled.

===Nerve palsy===
Post operative sciatic nerve palsy is another possible complication. The frequency of this complication is low. Femoral nerve palsy is another, but much rarer, complication. Both of these may resolve over time, but the healing process is slow. Patients with pre-existing nerve injury are at greater risk of experiencing this complication and are also slower to recover.

===Chronic pain===
A few patients who have had a hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made in the front of the hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).

===Death===
The rate of perioperative mortality for elective hip replacements is significantly less than 1%.

===Metal-on-metal hip implant failure===

By 2010, reports in the orthopaedic literature increasingly cited the problem of early failure of metal-on-metal prostheses in a small percentage of patients. Failures may have related to the release of minute metallic particles or metal ions from wear on the implants, causing pain and disability severe enough to require revision surgery in 1–3% of patients. Design deficits of some prothesis models, especially with heat-treated alloys and a lack of specialized surgical experience, accounted for most of the failures. In 2010, surgeons at medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic reported curtailing their use of metal-on-metal implants by 80 percent over the previous year, in favor of those made from other materials, such as combinations of metal and plastic. The cause of these failures remains controversial, and may include both design factors, operative technique factors, and factors related to patient immune response. In the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency commenced an annual monitoring regime for metal-on-metal hip replacement patients from May 2010. Data which are shown in The Australian Orthopaedic Association&#x27;s 2008 National Joint replacement registry, a record of nearly every hip implanted in that country over the previous 10 years, tracked 6,773 BHR (Birmingham Hip Resurfacing) hips and found that less than 0.33% may have been revised due to the patient&#x27;s reaction to the metal component. Other, similar, metal-on-metal designs have not fared as well, with some reports showing that 76–100% of people with these metal-on-metal implants with aseptic implant failures and needing revision surgery also had histological evidence of inflammation, accompanied by extensive lymphocyte infiltrates characteristic of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. It is not clear to what extent this phenomenon negatively affects orthopedic implant patients. However, for patients presenting with signs of allergic reaction, testing for sensitivity should be conducted. Removal of the device should be considered, since removal may alleviate the symptoms. Patients who have allergic reactions to alloy jewelry are more likely to have reactions to orthopedic implants. There is increasing awareness of the phenomenon of metal sensitivity, and many surgeons now take this into account when planning which implant is optimal for each patient.

On March 12, 2012, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a study, based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales, finding that metal-on-metal hip implants failed at much higher rates than other types of hip implants, and calling for a ban on all metal-on-metal hip prostheses. The analysis of 402,051 hip replacements showed that 6.2% of metal-on-metal hip implants had failed within five years, compared to 1.7% of metal-on-plastic and 2.3% of ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. Each increase in head size of metal-on-metal hip implants was associated with a 2% increase in failure rate. Surgeons of the British Hip Society recommended that large head metal-on-metal implants should no longer be implanted.

On February 10, 2011, the U.S. FDA issued an advisory on metal-on-metal hip implants, stating it was continuing to gather and review all available information about metal-on-metal hip systems. On June 27–28, 2012, an advisory panel met to decide whether to impose new standards, taking into account findings of the study in &quot;The Lancet&quot;. No new standards, such as routine checking of blood levels of metal ions, were set, but guidance was updated. The U.S. FDA does not require hip implants to be tested in clinical trials before they can be sold in the U.S. Instead, companies making new hip implants only need to prove that they are &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to other hip implants already on the market. The exception is metal-on-metal implants, which were not tested in clinical trials, but, due to the high revision rate of metal-on-metal hips, the FDA has stated that, in the future, clinical trials will be required for approval, and that post-market studies will be required to keep metal-on-metal hip implants on the market.

==Modern process==


The modern artificial joint owes much to the 1962 work of Sir John Charnley at Wrightington Hospital in the United Kingdom. His work in the field of tribology resulted in a design that almost completely replaced the other designs by the 1970s. Charnley&#x27;s design consisted of three parts:

# stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head
# polyethylene (originally Teflon), acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using
# Poly(methyl methacrylate) (acrylic) bone cement

The replacement joint, which was known as the low friction arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head () was chosen for Charnley&#x27;s belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley&#x27;s early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley&#x27;s machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley&#x27;s other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants. An example can be seen at the Science Museum, London.

The Exeter hip stem was developed in the United Kingdom during the same time as the Charnley device. Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon Robin Ling and University of Exeter engineer Clive Lee and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970. The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions.

Early implant designs had the potential to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.

Initial hip designs were made of a one-piece femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials. To combat loosening caused by polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel materials for the acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene was introduced in the late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.

When available implants are used, cemented stems tend to have a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.

==Techniques==
Each technique is defined by its relation to the gluteus medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool), antero-lateral (Watson-Jones), anterior (Smith-Petersen) and greater trochanter osteotomy. The literature offers no compelling evidence for any particular approach.

===Posterior===
The &quot;posterior&quot; (Moore or Southern) approach accesses the joint and capsule through the back, taking piriformis muscle and the short external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip abductors and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It has the advantage of becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk. Limited evidence suggests that the posterior approach may cause less nerve damage.

===Lateral approach===
The &quot;lateral&quot; approach approach requires elevation of the hip abductors (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which can be difficult to treat.

=== Antero-lateral ===
The &quot;anterolateral&quot; approach develops the interval between the tensor fasciae latae and the gluteus medius. The gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after the replacement.

=== Anterior ===
The &quot;anterior&quot; approach uses an interval between the sartorius muscle and tensor fasciae latae. This approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, has been adapted for use in hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems that had a small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to posterior surgery. Modern implant designs offer similar dislocation rates across the anterior and posterior approaches. The anterior approach has been shown in studies to variably improve early functional recovery, with possible complications of femoral component loosening and early revision.

=== Minimally invasive approaches ===
The dual incision approach and other minimally invasive surgery seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing the size of the incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures can be significantly impaired as the incisions get smaller. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. The majority of orthopedic surgeons use a &quot;minimally invasive&quot; approach compared to traditional approaches which were quite large comparatively.

Computer-assisted surgery and robotic surgery techniques are available to guide the surgeon to provide enhanced component accuracy. Several commercial CAS and robotic systems are available. Improved patient outcomes and reduced complications have not been demonstrated by these systems.

=== Pain control ===
Controlling pain during the surgery and after surgery is important. During surgery, systematic analgesia is commonly used, however peripheral nerve blocks and neuraxial blocks have been suggested and may be effective at reducing pain and the choice depends on individual preferences/factors and surgeon preference.

==Implants==

The prosthetic implant used in hip replacement consists of three parts: the acetabular cup, the femoral component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence for a number of newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups.

===Acetabular cup===
The acetabular cup is the component which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone are removed from the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is held in place by a metal coating on the outside of the cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.

===Articular interface===
The articular interface is not part of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining tolerances at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are , and . While was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54 mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled to reduce the amount of wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP), and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.

Dual mobility hip replacements reduce the risk of dislocation.

==Configuration==
Post-operative projectional radiography is routinely performed to ensure proper configuration of hip prostheses.

The direction of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation. For this purpose, the &quot;acetabular inclination&quot; and the &quot;acetabular anteversion&quot; are measurements of cup angulation in the coronal plane and the sagittal plane, respectively.
==Alternatives and variations==
===Conservative management===
The first line approach as an alternative to hip replacement is conservative management which involves a multimodal approach of oral medication, injections, activity modification and physical therapy. Conservative management can prevent or delay the need for hip replacement.

=== Preoperative care ===
Preoperative education is an important part of patient care. Some evidence indicates that it may slightly reduce anxiety before hip or knee replacement, with low risk of negative effects.

===Hemiarthroplasty===

Hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part unchanged. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after an intracapsular fracture of the femur neck (hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore and Thompson prostheses. A composite of metal and high-density polyethylene that forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) can be used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to offer any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly/frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because over time the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum. Independently mobile older adults with hip fractures may benefit from a total hip replacement instead of hemiarthroplasty.

===Hip resurfacing===
Hip resurfacing is an alternative to hip replacement surgery. It has been used in Europe since 1998 and became a common procedure. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.

The minimally invasive hip resurfacing procedure is a further refinement to hip resurfacing.

===Viscosupplementation===
Viscosupplementation is the injection of artificial lubricants into the joint. Use of these medications in the hip is off label. The cost of treatment is typically not covered by health insurance.

Some authorities claim that the future of osteoarthritis treatment is bioengineering, targeting the growth and/or repair of the damaged, arthritic joint. Centeno et al. reported on the partial regeneration of an arthritic human hip joint using mesenchymal stem cells. It is yet to be shown that this result will apply to a large group of patients and result in significant benefits. The FDA stated that this procedure does not conform to regulations, but Centeno claims that it is exempt from FDA regulation. It has not been shown in controlled clinical trials to be effective.

==Prevalence and cost==
Total hip replacement incidence varies in developed countries between 30 (Romania) and 290 (Germany) procedures per 100,000 population per year. Approximately 0.8% of Americans have undergone the procedure.

According to the International Federation of Healthcare Plans, the average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, $11,889 in the United Kingdom, $10,987 in France, $9,574 in Switzerland, and $7,731 in Spain. In the United States, the average cost of a total hip replacement varies widely by geographic region, ranging from $11,327 (Birmingham, Alabama) to $73,927 (Boston, Massachusetts).

==History==

The earliest recorded attempts at hip replacement were carried out in Germany in 1891 by Themistocles Gluck (1853–1942), who used ivory to replace the femoral head (the ball on the femur), attaching it with nickel-plated screws. Subsequently, he used a cement made from plaster of Paris, powdered pumice and glue.

Molded-glass implants were introduced in the 1920s by Smith-Peterson in the USA. Although these showed good bio-compatibility, they were mechanically fragile so he started experiments with metallic prostheses in the 1930s. In 1938, Philip Wiles of Middlesex General Hospital, UK carried out a total hip replacement using a stainless-steel prosthesis attached by bolts. In 1940, Dr. Austin T. Moore (1899–1963) at Columbia Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina performed a hip replacement using a prototype prosthesis made of the cobalt-chrome alloy Vitallium; it was inserted into the medullary canal and &quot;fenestrated&quot; to promote bone regrowth. A commercial version known as the &quot;Austin Moore Prosthesis&quot; was introduced in 1952; it is still in use today, typically for femoral neck fractures in the elderly. Following the lead of Wiles, several UK general hospitals including Norwich, Wrightington, Stanmore, Redhill and Exeter developed metal-based prostheses during the 1950s and 1960s.

Robert Juditt was the first to perform hip replacements via the anterior approach in 1947 in Paris. He taught this method to . Joel Matta, who had studied with Letournel, brought this approach to the United States and went on to popularize it.

Metal/Acrylic prostheses were tried in the 1950s but were found to be susceptible to wear.  In the 1960s, John Charnley at Wrightington General Hospital combined a metal prosthesis with a PTFE acetabular cup before settling on a metal/polyethylene design. Ceramic bearings were developed in the late 1970s.

The means of attachment have also diversified.  Early prostheses were attached by screws (e.g. Gluck, Wiles) with later developments using dental or bone cements (e.g. Charnley, Thompson) or cementless systems which relied on bone regrowth (Austin-Moore, Ring). The choice of alloy, bearing material, attachment and detailed geometry has led to the wide variety of prosthesis designs available today.

The London Science Museum has a collection of hip prostheses which reflect developments in the US, UK and elsewhere. These show the use of different materials and different designs for different circumstances (e.g. cemented and uncemented arthroplasty.)  Some are on display in the museum&#x27;s &quot;Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries&quot;. 

The items include:
* Prosthesis from 1960: The &quot;Gosset-style&quot; prosthesis was first introduced in 1949, although the specific example was made by Lusterlite Ltd of Leeds in 1960.  It has a perspex &quot;ball&quot; and simple rod-like shaft made of nickel-plated stainless-steel.
* Examples of prostheses from 1970 to 1985: Examples provided by Ipswich Hospital, UK are made of Vitallium (Co/Cr alloy) with curved standard or slender femoral stems. One example has a studded cup.
* Examples of prostheses from the 1990s: Examples, some of which were developed at the Redhill Group of Hospitals and Dorking Hospital, include a ringed titanium hip prosthesis with a screw stem and porous cup, a modular hip prosthesis with a textured femoral stem to aid bone grafting (material unspecified), two Thompson-type prostheses made of Vitallium alloy and an Austin Moore type prosthesis (material unspecified), with a porous metal femoral stem.
* Example of acetabular cup prosthesis from 1998: Example of a prosthetic socket, from Sulzer Orthopedics Inc., is the Inter-Op Hemispherical Shell. This is made from materials not recognised by the human body, so the body&#x27;s immune system does not attack and reject the joint.
* Examples of prostheses from 2006: Examples made by Smith &amp; Nephew Orthopedics include an &quot;Anthology&quot; titanium prosthesis, which has a flat-tapered stem placed in the thigh bone, and an &quot;Echelon&quot; (cobalt-chrome prosthesis for both cementless and cemented arthroplasty. Both have porous coating to promote bone adhesion.

The Science Museum&#x27;s collection also includes specialised surgical tools for hip operations:
* Instrument sets made by Downs Ltd for the City Hospital, Nottingham University Hospitals UK. Tools include head punches, reamers, drills and rasps.
* Prototype oscillating bone saws made by Kenneth Dobbie in the 1960s.  Dobbie was electrical engineer at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK.  He worked closely with the hip surgeon Sir John Charnley to develop the saws eventually leading to a commercial product made by De Soutter Brothers Ltd.

<text>Carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; (CIS) is a group of abnormal cells. While they are a form of neoplasm, there is disagreement over whether CIS should be classified as cancer. This controversy also depends on the exact CIS in question (e.g., cervical, skin, breast). Some authors do not classify them as cancer, however, recognizing that they can potentially become cancer. Others classify certain types as a non-invasive form of cancer. The term &quot;pre-cancer&quot; has also been used.

These abnormal cells grow in their normal place, thus &quot;in situ&quot; (). For example, carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the skin, also called Bowen&#x27;s disease, is the accumulation of dysplastic epidermal cells within the epidermis only, that has failed to penetrate into the deeper dermis. For this reason, CIS will usually not form a tumor. Rather, the lesion is flat (in the skin, cervix, etc.) or follows the existing architecture of the organ (in the breast, lung, etc.). Exceptions include CIS of the colon (polyps), the bladder (preinvasive papillary cancer), or the breast (ductal carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; or lobular carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;).

Many forms of CIS have a high probability of progression into cancer, and therefore removal may be recommended; however, progression of CIS is known to be highly variable and not all CIS becomes invasive cancer.

In the TNM classification, carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; is reported as TisN0M0 (stage 0).

==Terminology==
These terms are related since they represent the steps of the progression toward cancer:
*Dysplasia is the earliest form of precancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Dysplasia can be low-grade or high-grade. High-grade dysplasia may also be referred to as carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;.
*Invasive carcinoma, usually simply called cancer, has the potential to invade and spread to surrounding tissues and structures, and may eventually be lethal.

==Examples==

* Cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), previously called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), is a form of dysplasia that can progress to cervical cancer. The term carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; may be used interchangeably with high-grade SIL.
* Ductal carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the breast is the most common precancer in women. 
* Bowen&#x27;s disease is a squamous carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the skin.
* Colon polyps often contain areas of CIS that will almost always transform into colon cancer if left untreated.
* High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is equivalent to CIS of the prostate.
* Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) of the lung is the only form of CIS that can kill directly because, in rare cases (the &quot;pneumonic form&quot;), it expands greatly and fills the lungs, preventing breathing and causing other dire effects on the host. Thus, the pneumonic form of BAC is a true malignant entity, but is not &quot;invasive&quot; in the classical sense. For this reason, it is considered a form of CIS by pathologists, but not by oncologists or surgeons, and inclusion of this form of cancer among the types of CIS is controversial.

==Treatment==

Carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; is, by definition, a localized phenomenon, with no potential for metastasis unless it progresses into cancer. Therefore, its removal eliminates the risk of subsequent progression into a life-threatening condition.

Some forms of CIS (e.g., colon polyps and polypoid tumours of the bladder) can be removed using an endoscope, without conventional surgical resection. Dysplasia of the uterine cervix is removed by excision (cutting it out) or by burning with a laser. Bowen&#x27;s disease of the skin is removed by excision. Other forms require major surgery, the best known being intraductal carcinoma of the breast (also treated with radiotherapy).

<text>Sebastien Vorbe (born 4 June 1976) is a Haitian professional footballer who played as a midfielder for Violette.

==Club career==
Vorbe started his career playing for the First Division in the Ligue Haïtienne for the Violette AC, where he would go on to win the national championship his first year during the 1994–95 season.

After the following year, Vorbe played college soccer at Florida International University in 1997 and 1998, where he registered nine goals and 13 assists in 37 games. Following two seasons at FIU, Vorbe returned to Haiti to play with Violette AC, only to win his second national championship.

===LA Galaxy (2000–01)===
At age 24, Vorbe signed a one-year contract as a discovery player on 25 April 2000 to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy, arguably one of the most successful clubs of Major League Soccer. He was noticed on the international stage for Haiti during the qualifying tournament in Los Angeles and the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament in Miami and had the opportunity to train with the club during preseason. Although players before him played in defunct American leagues, Vorbe became just the second Haitian player ever (to Patrick Tardieu), to play for the MLS since its 1993 creation. He scored his first major league goal against the defending MLS champion D.C. United leading Galaxy to a 2–1 victory. In 19 games and 915 minutes with the team, Vorbe scored four goals in ten starts, the most by four rookies on the team. A notable game was when Vorbe scored the winning goal at the 50th minute against a quality Club Atlético Talleres, that was just promoted to Argentine Primera División after an outstanding season.

In January 2001 Vorbe played in the 2000 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, where Galaxy would defeat Honduran club, Olimpia in the finals and win its first title in the competition.

Vorbe was waived on 5 March 2001.

===Violette (2001)===
After the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, Vorbe would again return to Violette AC, where he became a mainstay and continues to play.

==International career==
Vorbe represented the Haiti, from 1999 to 2000. He scored Haiti&#x27;s lone goal of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament.

==Personal life==
He is the nephew of notable Haitian player Philippe Vorbe.

<doc id="1125441" wikidata="Q8015128" url="?curid=1125441" title="William Marks (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>William Marks (November 15, 1792 – May 22, 1872) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and was a member of the First Presidency in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ). Marks is mentioned in the &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; in sections 117 and 124 of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) edition and in section 115 of the Community of Christ edition.

== Early life ==
Marks was born in Rutland, Vermont, on November 15, 1792 to Cornwall (or Cornell) Marks and Sarah Goodrich. He married Rosannah Robinson on May 2, 1813, and was the father of five children.

==Early church membership==
Marks was baptized a member of Church of Christ sometime in April 1835 in New York and ordained a priest shortly thereafter. He was ordained an elder on June 3, 1836. Partly due to the lack of records available on his baptism, Marks was rebaptized in proxy by the LDS Church on January 29, 1965.

In September 1837, Marks was appointed to the High Council at Kirtland, Ohio, and agent of the &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; when Joseph Smith and others fled Ohio under mob pressure. Marks was appointed by revelation (D&amp;C 117) to leave Ohio and move to Far West, Missouri, to preside over the body of Saints. However, before he arrived, the Mormons were expelled from the state under the &quot;Extermination Order&quot; signed into law by Lilburn W. Boggs.

Marks was also seen in vision by Joseph Smith, according to Smith’s own record on March 29, 1838. Smith wrote that he saw Marks:
&quot;... closely pursued by an innumerable concourse of enemies, who pressed upon him hard; and when they were about to devour him, and had seemingly obtained some degree of advantage over him, a chariot of fire came, and near the place, even the angel of the Lord, put forth his hand upon Bro. Marks and said unto him: &#x27;Thou art my son, come here.&#x27; And immediately he was caught up in the chariot and rode away triumphantly out of their midst. And again the Lord said, &#x27;I will raise thee up for a blessing unto many people.&#x27;&quot;

==Leadership in Nauvoo==
When the Saints arrived in Commerce, Illinois, in 1839, Marks was appointed as president of the church&#x27;s Commerce Stake. (He later was president of the Nauvoo Stake). He served in that position until 1844.

He was also elected as a Nauvoo municipal alderman and as one of the regents of the University of the City of Nauvoo in February 1841, and was a founder of the Nauvoo Agricultural and Manufacturing Association. He was appointed by revelation (D&amp;C 124) to contribute to and be on the Nauvoo House committee, and served as landlord of the Mansion House.

As stake president, he assisted in the laying of the cornerstones of the Nauvoo Temple in April 1841. He was initiated into Masonry in April 1842 and received his endowment on May 4, 1842, as a member of the Council of Fifty.

Although a close friend of Joseph Smith, Marks occasionally found himself at odds with the prophet. Smith presented evidence of why Sidney Rigdon should be rejected as first counselor in the First Presidency of the church during the October 1843 General Conference. He accused Rigdon, a long-time friend of Marks, as having lost his &quot;integrity and steadfastness&quot; and stated that he had no confidence in Rigdon&#x27;s abilities as a leader in the church or as his counselor. Regardless of these accusations, Marks motioned that Rigdon remain in his station as a counselor in the First Presidency. Rigdon was sustained to the position by the membership of the church. After the vote, Smith stood and stated, &quot;I have thrown him off my shoulders and you have again put him on me, you may carry him, but I will not.&quot; Because Rigdon was rejected by Smith, most of the core leadership of the church, including members of the Council of Fifty and Anointed Quorum, questioned Rigdon&#x27;s standing and authority and, later, his claim to succeed Smith as head of the church. Rigdon and Marks were also known opponents of plural marriage. Those who supported this controversial practice instituted by Smith saw such dissent as disloyal.

Smith also spoke at the funeral of Marks&#x27;s son. Among his remarks he said:

:&quot;I never felt more solemn. It calls to mind the death of my oldest brother [Alvin], who died in New York, and my youngest brother, [Don] Carloss Smith who died in Nauvoo…. It will be but a short time before we shall all in like manner be called. It may be the case with me as well as you. Some have supposed that Br[other] Joseph could not die, but this is a mistake. It is true there ha[ve] been times when I have had the promise of my life to accomplish such-and-such things, but, having accomplish[ed] those things, I have not at present any lease [on] my life. I am as liable to die as other men.&quot;

This funerary sermon is considered one of the most introspective and emotionally depressed discourses by Smith, and pointed to by Mormons as foreknowledge and a prophecy of his own death which occurred not long thereafter.

In the weeks before Joseph Smith&#x27;s death, Marks claimed that Joseph came to him and told him that plural marriage had proved a curse rather than a blessing to the church. Smith wanted to take decisive steps to end the practice, but, according to Marks, time ran out. Other purported pieces of evidence, such as Joseph&#x27;s burning of the polygamy revelation and destroying his temple garments, seem to support Marks&#x27;s story. Not all members of the church hierarchy believed Marks&#x27;s testimony, though Quinn believes that Brigham Young gave credence to it, as he later said that if Joseph &quot;had followed the Spirit of revelation in him he never would have gone to Carthage&quot;. In addition, Young would also state that Smith had wearied of polygamous marriage by the time of his death. Ironically, Joseph Smith III later would not believe Marks, either, since Marks implicated Joseph Smith III&#x27;s father in polygamy.

==Issues with apostolic succession==
At the time of the death of Joseph Smith, much of the leadership of the church had been campaigning for Smith’s candidacy for President of the United States. Marks, as landlord of the Nauvoo Mansion, oversaw some of the funerary preparations for the burial of Joseph and his brother, Hyrum.

According to William Clayton&#x27;s diary, Emma Smith supported Marks as the successor to her husband. According to Smith, Marks had a right to church succession as the High Council President, which she asserted was equal in authority to the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency. Furthermore, she felt that while apostles had authority in unorganized parts of the church, they did not have authority in the stake of Zion, Nauvoo. This reasoning was one of many interpretations put forward by various factions in the months after Smith&#x27;s death.

Historian D. Michael Quinn claims that, despite the foregoing, church succession in Nauvoo revolved around one central issue: plural marriage. Quinn maintains that Marks&#x27;s known opposition to plural marriage was a crucial issue. He also argues that, although a small group of church leaders almost approved Marks as the next church president, by July 10, 1844, Willard Richards—one the Church&#x27;s Twelve Apostles—delayed all action until Quorum President Brigham Young returned from the presidential campaign. Young and the majority of the Quorum of the Twelve, Quinn asserts, feared that Marks would end plural marriage and other ordinances that they saw as crucial to exaltation in the afterlife.

Quinn states that, despite Emma&#x27;s support, and despite receiving his endowments and anointings before any other successor claimants (including every member of the Quorum of Twelve), Marks did not advance his own claims to church leadership. Instead, Marks sympathized with Sidney Rigdon and supported his bid to become &quot;guardian&quot; of the church. Because of this and because he did not support the Twelve Apostles, Marks was removed from the High Council at the October General Conference in on October 7, 1844, and also rejected as president of the Nauvoo Stake of Zion. Patriarch John Smith, an uncle of Joseph&#x27;s, was chosen as Marks&#x27;s successor. Despite Brigham Young&#x27;s desire to see Marks excommunicated, the Nauvoo High Council refused his request. Marks never became excommunicated. After several opponents of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles were terrorized by Nauvoo policemen, William Marks left Nauvoo in February 1845. Brigham Young observed that &quot;Bro. Marks had gone without being whittled out&quot;—a reference to a tactic of surrounding an opponent with adult men who whistled and whittled without saying a word to the opponent. Young and Marks never reconciled after this.

==RLDS involvement==
After the exodus of Young&#x27;s followers to Utah, Marks became convinced that Sidney Rigdon’s claims of leadership were unfounded, and he joined the Strangite movement, later becoming a counselor to James Strang in the Strangite First Presidency. Marks left the Strangites between 1853 and 1855, loosely affiliating himself with other Latter Day Saint denominations. During this time he associated with Zenas H. Gurley, Jason W. Briggs, and William W. Blair. The four were convinced that succession in the presidency of the church must be lineal, descending from father to son, and promoted the idea of a Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Between 1853 and 1859 they approached Joseph Smith III dozens of times to convince him to take leadership of the RLDS movement, which he eventually did.

On June 11, 1859, Marks was formally received as a member of the RLDS movement without rebaptism. Alongside Zenas Gurley, he presided over the conference in April 1860, wherein Marks aided Gurley in ordaining Joseph Smith III as president of the high priesthood in the newly incorporated Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

According to Joseph Smith III in March 1863, &quot;a revelation was received directing the church to call and ordain William Marks to be a Counselor to the President of the church, in order that the Quorum [of the First Presidency] might be more perfectly prepared to discharge the duties devolving upon it.&quot; This revelation was presented to the April 1863 General Conference of the RLDS Church and canonized as Doctrine and Covenants Section 115. Marks&#x27; ordination took place at the same conference, joining Joseph Smith III and Jason W. Briggs in the RLDS First Presidency.

In 1866, Marks was appointed to the committee to receive manuscripts from Joseph Smith’s widow, Emma Smith Bidamon, and print the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.

Marks was first counselor in the First Presidency of the Reorganized Church until his death in Plano, Illinois, on May 22, 1872. A marked grave bearing his name is located in the Shabbona Grove Cemetery at Shabbona Grove, DeKalb, Illinois, adjacent to that of his wife Rosannah Robinson Marks, who died on October 18, 1862. Marks had married a second time in 1866 to Julia Ann Durfee, who survived him.

<text>Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven (born 5 December, 1951 in Antwerp) is a Belgian artist whose work involves painting, drawing, computer art and video art.

==Biography==
Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven (also known as &quot;AMVK&quot;) was born in Antwerp and lives in Antwerp and Berlin. In 1981 she founded the noise band Club Moral with Danny Devos. Since 1982 she has been represented by Zeno X Gallery in Antwerp, Belgium, and since 1999 by Galerie Barbara Thumm in Berlin. In 2003 she was awarded the Flanders&#x27; Prize for Visual Arts.

In 2005 the HeadNurse-files was published. By means of installation shots, film stills and artistic images, this book presents an overview of the projects&#x27; development from 1995 to 2004 and possibly beyond. In 2006 she was awarded a DAAD stipendium to spend one year in Berlin.
In 2022 she will receive an honorary doctor degree from the University of Antwerp.

==Life and work==
Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven has been fascinated for a long time with the representation in the mass media of images of women, of interiors, of the kinetic powers of any kind of language. She investigates supra-moral connections in contemporary society between sex and technology. Her work connects different knowledge systems, explores the areas of the unconscious, and looks at moral aberrations or the obscene from a female point of view.

Since 2005 she has been working on a conceptual and pictorial trialogue between the mystic Marguerite Porete, the hermetic Giordano Bruno and the philosopher Herbert Marcuse.

<doc id="1125451" wikidata="Q15516539" url="?curid=1125451" title="Frank Anstey">
<text>Francis George Anstey (18 August 186531 October 1940) was an Australian politician and writer. He served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1910 to 1934, representing the Labor Party. He was Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation in the Scullin government from 1929 to 1931.

==Early life==
Anstey was born in London, England, the son of an iron-miner who died five months before his son was born, and he had little formal education. He stowed away on a passenger ship when he was 11 and arrived in Melbourne in 1877. He then spent ten years working on ships to the South Pacific islands. After spending a period as an itinerant worker (a &quot;swaggie&quot; in Australian slang), he moved to Sale, where he met Katherine Mary Bell McColl. They married in 1887 and had two sons. He became a cleaner in Melbourne, where he soon became involved in politics. He worked on the Melbourne tramways and became President of the Tramways Employees Union. Self-educated, he wrote extensively for Labor newspapers such as &quot;The Tocsin&quot; and &quot;Labor Call&quot;.

In 1898, Anstey co-founded the Victorian Labour Federation (VLF) with George Elmslie and Tom Tunnecliffe. The VLF was intended to challenge the existing labour institutions in Victoria, which its founders believed had failed to advance the goals of the movement. The federation was modelled on the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party and sought to combine the functions of a syndicated union, a co-operative, a friendly society, and a political party. Anstey gained prominence as the lead speaker at meetings of the VLF, which collapsed in 1900 &quot;amid political bickering and personal recriminations&quot;. He subsequently focused his efforts on the mainstream United Labor Party.

==Political career==
In 1902 Anstey was elected as a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for East Bourke Boroughs, and from 1904 he was member for Brunswick, both electorates being in the working-class suburbs of Melbourne. He switched to federal politics at the 1910 election, winning the seat of Bourke in the House of Representatives.

Despite his English birth, Anstey was an Australian nationalist. He saw Australia as an economic colony of the finance houses of the City of London, which, like many in the labour movement at this time, he described as the &quot;money power&quot;. His views are typified by this passage from a 1907 editorial in the newspaper of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union:

In 1914 Australia, under the Labor government of Andrew Fisher, entered the First World War on the side of Britain. Anstey was one of the few Labor members who opposed the war from the start, and as a result he was highly unpopular for a time. By 1917, however, anti-war sentiment was growing and Anstey became one of the leaders of the movement against conscription for the war.
Anstey published a pamphlet called &quot;The Kingdom of Shylock&quot; in 1917. In this he described the &quot;money power&quot; which he said controlled and manipulated capitalism from behind the scenes. &quot;London is, so far, the web centre of international finance,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In London are assembled the actual chiefs or the representatives of the great financial houses of the world. The Money Power is something more than Capitalism. These men constitute the Financial Oligarchy. No nation can be really free where this financial oligarchy is permitted to hold dominion, and no &#x27;democracy&#x27; can be aught but a name that does not shake it from its throne.&quot;

Anstey described this system as the &quot;Black Masonic Plutocracy&quot;: &quot;These men constitute the Financial Oligarchy, this group of speculators properly designated and distinguished as the Money Power, controls the whole mechanism of exchange, and all undertakings in the field of industry are subject to its will and machinations. It wields an unseen sceptre over thrones and populations, and bloody slaughter is as profitable to its pockets as the most peaceful peculation.&quot;

&quot;In &quot;The Kingdom of Shylock&quot; Anstey identified the leaders of the &quot;money power&quot; in London as a group of private financiers associated with the circles of the Morgan family in the United States. &quot;After Medina came the Jew, Manasseh Lopes,&quot; Anstey wrote. &quot;Then came Samson Gideon and the Goldsmids – Abraham and Benjamin. They were succeeded by the Rothschilds.&quot;

The fact that some of Anstey&#x27;s prominent targets were Jewish has caused critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. The Australian labour historian Peter Love writes: &quot;The anti-Semitism in &quot;The Kingdom of Shylock&quot; was no aberration. It arose from the logic of his [Anstey&#x27;s] analysis combined with the cultural tradition of which he was a part. The vulgarities of Christian mythology had built up an accretion of hatred and suspicion towards Jews over many centuries. The resulting stereotype of the greedy and cunning Jewish financier was a commonplace convention in the writings of British radicals and American populists. It was also a persistent theme among Australian labour radicals.

In 1922 Anstey became Assistant Leader of the ALP in the House, a post he held until 1927.

===Scullin government===

Following Labor&#x27;s win at the 1929 election, Anstey became Minister for Health and Minister for Repatriation in the government of Prime Minister James Scullin. But Scullin&#x27;s government soon fell victim to the Great Depression. Anstey supported the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, who advocated repudiating Australia&#x27;s debts to British bondholders (see debt moratorium) and using the funds to create employment in order to increase production. This may be compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;New Deal.&quot; In March 1931 Anstey was dumped from the Ministry by the Labor Caucus for supporting the &quot;Lang Plan&quot;.

Despite this, Anstey did not follow Lang out of the Labor Party. Demoralised and cynical, he stayed on the backbench until his retirement at the 1934 election, when he and his wife moved to Sydney. After his wife&#x27;s death he moved back to Melbourne, where he died of cancer. Ironically, he had devoted his last years to financial speculation and had become a wealthy man.

==Legacy==
Anstey &quot;came to personify Labor&#x27;s left populist tradition&quot;. He is especially remembered as the mentor of John Curtin, on whom he had a great influence in Curtin&#x27;s early years. Like Curtin, he was a heavy drinker. He wrote extensive unpublished memoirs, but burned them shortly before his death. It is often rumoured that he did that in a drunken rage, but that is unsubstantiated. Frank Hardy wrote in his book, &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, that Frank Anstey received a visit from John Wren (immortalised as &quot;John West&quot; in Hardy&#x27;s other book &quot;Power Without Glory&quot;), who asked Anstey to eradicate any reference to him in Anstey&#x27;s memoirs, to prevent them from becoming an exposé of Wren&#x27;s gambling empire.

Anstey railway station in Melbourne was named in Anstey&#x27;s honour.

<text>Raman Lamba (; 2 January 1960 – 23 February 1998) was an Indian cricketer. Raman had played in four Tests and 32 One Day Internationals, mainly as a batsman. He was a popular player in Bangladesh&#x27;s Dhaka Premier League and also represented Ireland in unofficial One Day International matches. Lamba died after slipping into a coma, due to an internal haemorrhage, three days after being hit on the temporal bone by a cricket ball while fielding in Bangladesh&#x27;s league cricket.

== Profile ==
Raman Lamba was born on 2 January 1960 in Meerut. He was a right-handed batsman who was noted for his fitness. He commenced his Ranji Trophy career in 1980-81 and continued until his death in the 1997–98 season. He scored 6,362 runs at an average of 53.91 in 87 matches, scoring 22 centuries including 5 double centuries and his career highest of 312 versus Himachal Pradesh at Delhi in 1994–95, which is not only his personal highest score but also among the highest individual scores for Delhi. In 1994-95 he aggregated 1,034 runs in 10 matches at an average of 73.86 with 3 centuries and 4 half-centuries, which was a record number of runs in a Ranji Trophy season. He led Delhi in 8 matches in the season 1994–95, winning 3 and drawing 5. His 320 in the Duleep Trophy for North Zone against West Zone in the final at Bhilai in 1986-87 still remains among the highest individual scores. In first-class cricket, he scored a total of 8,776 runs at 53.84 and his 175 innings including 31 centuries and 27 fifties.

Lamba&#x27;s highest score 320* came in the Duleep Trophy Final in 1987-88 for North Zone v West Zone. The West might have felt very satisfied with their first innings score of 444, with their captain and Test opener Anshuman Gaekwad making 216. Their opponents, however, had other ideas and replied with 868 all out. Lamba left Gaekwad in the shade with 320 in 720 minutes which was scored off 471 balls including six 6s and thirty 4s. That season he totalled 1097 runs at 84.38. Seven years later he crossed the triple hundred mark again with 312 for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match versus Himachal Pradesh at Delhi. The hosts ran up 637-3 declared owing much to a first wicket Indian record stand of 464 between Lamba and Ravi Sehgal, who made 216. Lamba&#x27;s 312 came off 392 balls with two 6s and twenty five 4s and took 567 minutes. These innings and similar knocks, such as his 617-ball 250 for Delhi v Punjab in 1996/97 gained him a somewhat mixed reputation.

== International cricket ==

===One-day cricket===
Lamba appeared for India as a one-day player in the 1986 Australasia Cup final, when he also took a good catch under pressure to dismiss Abdul Qadir off Kapil Dev, where he played as substitute fielder. He had a great opening in One day cricket as he scored 64 in his first match and 102 in his sixth match as he won the man of the series against Australia for scoring 278 runs at an average of 55.60 per innings with a century and 2 fifties. His scoring pattern in 6 innings were 64, 1, 20*, 74, 17 and 102. Lamba and Krishnamachari Srikkanth were India&#x27;s openers for the Jawaharlal Nehru Centenary Cup in 1989. Twice they had 100 runs opening partnership, against Australia and Pakistan. Their approach was similar, as both were stroke players. Their aggressive batting approach as openers was later adopted by opening pair Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana in 1996 World Cup.

==Personal life==
In 1987 Raman Lamba met his future wife, Irishwoman Kim Michelle Crothers and they were engaged for 3 years before getting married on 7, September 1990. Lamba started playing as an overseas professional cricketer in Ireland with Ulster from 1990. Raman and Kim have two children Jasmyn and Kamran. Kim settled down with both children in Portugal after Raman&#x27;s demise.

== Death ==
Lamba died on 23 February 1998 in the Post Graduate Hospital in Dhaka in Bangladesh after he was hit on the temple by a cricket ball hit by Mehrab Hossain off left-arm spinner Saifullah Khan while fielding at forward short leg. It is said that Lamba was asked to wear a helmet, but he thought it was unnecessary because only three balls of the over were remaining when he was asked to move to that position. He was known by his teammates not to use a helmet while fielding close in. Lamba was playing for Dhaka&#x27;s leading club, Abahani Krira Chakra, in the final of the Premier Division cricket match versus Mohammedan Sporting Club at the Dhaka Bangabandhu Stadium on 20 February 1998. The shot was so ferocious that the ball deflected from his head and flew into wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud&#x27;s gloves. Mohammad Aminul Islam, the former Bangladesh captain, recalled &quot;I was the new man in and asked Raman if he was okay. He said, &#x27;Bulli (Islam&#x27;s nickname is Bulbul) main to mar gaya&#x27; (I am dead, Bulli)&quot;. Although the injury did not appear to be particularly serious, Lamba suffered an internal haemorrhage and slipped into a coma. Although a neurosurgeon was flown in from Delhi, all efforts were in vain. After three days, his ventilator was removed and Lamba was declared dead.

There were tributes from all over the world when Lamba died. His wife, Kim, paid him a moving tribute when she put the cap of his local team, Sonnet Club, on Lamba.

==Trivia==
* On his first tour abroad to England in 1986, he was involved in a rare incident when 12 fielders were on the field for one full over from Ravi Shastri in the second Test against England at Leeds, when as a substitute for K. Srikkanth, he remained on the field even though Srikkanth had already arrived on the field quietly, without requesting Raman Lamba to go back to the pavilion. The umpires were also unaware of Srikkanth&#x27;s return to the field throughout the 6-ball over in which nothing untoward took place on the field.
* Just as Lamba could not play a Test on the tour of England in 1986, he missed a test on his next tour of Pakistan in 1989–90 due to a finger injury in the morning of the first test day.
* Lamba was involved in one more controversial incident. He had a wordy clash with West Zone cricketer Rashid Patel on the field of play during a Duleep Trophy match at Jamshedpur in 1990–91. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on 25 February 1991 banned Lamba till 31 December 1991 and Patel till 31 March 1992 from playing in any first-class cricket match as a punishment.
* 2019 Telugu film&quot; Jersey&quot; and its 2022 Hindi remake film of the same name is loosely based on his life.

<doc id="1125464" wikidata="Q1754217" url="?curid=1125464" title="Western calligraphy">
<text>Western calligraphy is the art of writing and penmanship
as practiced in the Western world, especially using the Latin alphabet (but also including calligraphic use of the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, as opposed to &quot;Eastern&quot; traditions such as Turko-Perso-Arabic, Chinese or Indian calligraphy).

A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is &quot;the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner.&quot; The story of writing is one of aesthetic development framed within the technical skills, transmission speed(s) and material limitations of a person, time and place.

A style of writing is described as a &quot;script&quot;, &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;alphabet&quot;.

Calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not supersede the legibility of the letters. 
Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.

Calligraphic writing continued to play a role long after the introduction of the printing press in the West, official documents being drawn up in &quot;engrossed&quot; or handwritten form well into the 18th century. 
A revival of calligraphy in the later 19th century was associated with the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements, and it continues to be practiced, typically commissioned for private purposes such as wedding invitations, logo design, memorial documents, etc.

==History==
===Late Antiquity===
The rolls of papyrus used in classical antiquity (the or ) in Late Antiquity were gradually replaced by the .
Reed pens were replaced by quill pens.
Isidore of Seville explained the then-current relation between codex, (&#x27;book&#x27;), and (&#x27;scroll&#x27;) in his (VI.13): 
: &quot;A is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called by way of metaphor from the trunks of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock (), because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.&quot;

A tradition of biblical manuscripts in form goes back to the 2nd century (), and from about the 5th century, two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin , or &#x27;inch&#x27;) developed from various Roman bookhands.

===Early Middle Ages===
With the onset of the Middle Ages from about the 7th century, literacy in Latin Europe was increasingly limited to the monasteries.

The tradition of illumination has its origins in Late Antiquity, and reaches early medieval Europe in about the 8th century, notable early examples including the Book of Durrow, Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells.

Charlemagne&#x27;s devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of &quot;a crowd of scribes&quot;, according to Alcuin, the Abbot of York. Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or Carolingian minuscule. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783) — a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc. Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.

===Later Middle Ages===
Blackletter (also known as Gothic) and its variation Rotunda, gradually developed from the Carolingian hand during the 12th century. Over the next three centuries, the scribes in northern Europe used an ever more compressed and spiky form of Gothic. Those in Italy and Spain preferred the rounder but still heavy-looking Rotunda. During the 15th century, Italian scribes returned to the Roman and Carolingian models of writing and designed the Italic hand, also called Chancery cursive, and Roman bookhand. These three hands — Gothic, Italic, and Roman bookhand — became the models for printed letters. Johannes Gutenberg used Gothic to print his famous Bible, but the lighter-weight Italic and Roman bookhand have since become the standard.

During the Middle Ages, hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were produced: some illuminated with gold and fine painting, some illustrated with line drawings, and some just textbooks.

Towards the end of the Middle Ages, administration in the states of Western Europe became more centralised. Paper was again widely available in Europe, which allowed a bureaucracy with standardized bookkeeping. In late medieval England, this led to the development of the &quot;Chancery Standard&quot; of Late Middle English, along with new forms of standardised calligraphy used for the production of legal or official documents. By the mid-15th century, Chancery Standard was used for most official purposes except by the Church, which still used Latin, and for some legal purposes, for which Law French and some Latin were used. It was disseminated around England by bureaucrats on official business and slowly gained prestige. The production of finalized, calligraphic copies of documents in Chancery hand came to be known as &quot;engrossing&quot;, from Anglo-French (Old French &#x27;in large (letters)&#x27;).

In the late 1490s and early 1500s, the English bookprinting engineer Richard Pynson favored Chancery Standard in his published works, and consequently pushed the English spelling further towards standardization.

===Early Modern era===
In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher. The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the , the , (known as Round hand in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the &quot;bastarda&quot;.

While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published circa 1650.

With the destruction of the during the sack of Rome (1527), the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France. By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery Circumflessa, which in turn fathered the and later English Roundhand.

In England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.

===Modern revival===

After printing became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline. However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.

The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Edward Johnston is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy. 
After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, he was introduced to William Lethaby in 1898, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, who advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum.

This triggered Johnston&#x27;s interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in Southampton Row, London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. He was commissioned by Frank Pick to design a new typeface for London Underground, still used today (with minor modifications).

He has been credited for reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, &quot;Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering&quot; (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Stanley Morison, Eric Gill, Alfred Fairbank and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the Foundational hand, although Johnston never used the terms &quot;Foundational&quot; or &quot;Foundational Hand&quot;. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle. He first referred to this hand as &quot;Foundational Hand&quot; in his 1909 publication, &quot;Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen&quot;.

===20th century===
Graily Hewitt taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Hewitt helped to found the Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators (SSI) in 1921, probably the world&#x27;s foremost calligraphy society.

Hewitt is not without both critics and supporters in his rendering of Cennino Cennini&#x27;s medieval gesso recipes. Donald Jackson, a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation. Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to Prince Philip of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.

Johnston&#x27;s pupil, Anna Simons, was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of &quot;Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering&quot; in 1910. Austrian Rudolf Larisch, a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.

Rudolf Koch was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch&#x27;s books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably Karlgeorg Hoefer, and Hermann Zapf.

==Modern calligraphy==
Calligraphy today finds diverse applications. These include graphic design, logo design, type design, paintings, scholarship, maps, menus, greeting cards, invitations, legal documents, diplomas, cut stone inscriptions, memorial documents, props and moving images for film and television, business cards, and handmade presentations. Many calligraphers make their livelihood in the addressing of envelopes and invitations for public and private events including wedding stationery. Entry points exist for both children and adults via classes and instruction books.

The scope of the calligraphic art is more than pure antiquarian interest. Johnston&#x27;s legacy remains pivotal to the ambitions of perhaps most Western calligraphers:

It is possible even now to go back to the child&#x27;s - something like the early calligrapher&#x27;s - point of view, and this is the only healthy one for any fine beginning: to this nothing can be added; all Rules must give way to Truth and Freedom.

The multimillion-dollar Saint John&#x27;s Bible project for the 21st century, completed in 2011, had engaged Donald Jackson with an international scriptorium. It is designed as a 21st-century illuminated Bible, executed with both ancient and modern tools and techniques. The earlier 20th-century &quot;Bulley Bible&quot; was executed by a student of Edward Johnston&#x27;s, Edward Bulley.

The digital era has facilitated the creation and dissemination of thousands of new and historically styled fonts. Calligraphy gives unique expression to every individual letterform within a design layout which is not the strength of typeface technologies no matter their sophistication. The usefulness of the digital medium to the calligrapher is not limited to the computer layout of the new Saint John&#x27;s Bible prior to working by hand. Graphics tablets facilitate calligraphic design work more than large size art pieces. The internet supports a number of online communities of calligraphers and hand lettering artists.

<text>Frangelico () is a brand of hazelnut and herb–flavored liqueur coloured with caramel coloring, which is produced in Canale, Italy. It is 20% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 40 proof. Formerly, it was 24% ABV or 48 proof. When produced by the Barbaro family it was bottled at 28% ABV or 56 proof. The brand was created in 1978.

According to the manufacturer, the name of the liqueur is based on a legend of a hermit monk named Fra Angelico who lived in the Piedmont region of Italy and &quot;created unique recipes for liqueurs&quot;. The bottle itself most closely resembles the habit of a Franciscan friar.

The brand was purchased by Gruppo Campari in 2010, having previously been owned by William Grant and C&amp;C Group.

==Ingredients==
Frangelico contains sugar, alcohol, hazelnut distillate, natural and artificial flavours, and caramel.

A serving of Frangelico contains about of sugar, making Frangelico approximately 40% sugar by weight.

==Consumption==
Recommended usage includes &#x27;pour it over ice...pour it over ice with a squeeze of fresh lime.. . mix with soda, or chill it and enjoy as a shot. It is also an ingredient in cocktails.

==Appearances in media==
The artist Jeff Koons reproduced two Frangelico advertisements, &quot;Stay in Tonight&quot; and &quot;Find a Quiet Table&quot;, in his 1986 &quot;Luxury &amp; Degradation&quot; series of paintings and sculptures based on the role of alcohol in culture. According to Koons he used the Frangelico ads to &quot;defin[e] a $45,000 and up income&quot;, in contrast to other works in the series which correspond to lower income levels.

<text>The British Rail Class 482 electric multiple units were built by ABB in 1992, for use on the Waterloo &amp; City line. The units are almost identical to the 1992 tube stock built for the Central line.

Ten 2-car units were built, numbered 482501–510. Each unit consisted of a type &quot;E&quot; driving motor, numbered 65501–510, and a type &quot;F&quot; non-driving motor, numbered 67501–510. Trains were operated using two units semi-permanently coupled, with the driving motors outermost.

The units were built as direct replacements for the elderly Class 487 units, dating from 1940. They were delivered to Ruislip depot during March 1993, and were painted in Network SouthEast livery; however, as the Waterloo &amp; City line was completely separate from the rest of the National Rail network, and was entirely underground, they did not receive yellow front ends. Following commissioning (which included test runs as 8-car trains over most of the Central line), they were delivered by road to the Waterloo &amp; City line during May and June 1993, and following further test runs, entered service on 19 July 1993.

On 1 April 1994, operational control of the Waterloo &amp; City line transferred to London Underground. Shortly after the transfer of the line, unit numbers and NSE logos were removed, and LU roundels added together with Central line diagrams. The BR car numbers were retained, not having previously been used by London Underground; and some of the other BR markings were also retained on the inner ends of the &quot;F&quot; cars, but otherwise the trains remained in as-built condition until refurbishment in 2006.

<doc id="1125476" wikidata="Q900370" url="?curid=1125476" title="Cope reaction">
<text>The Cope reaction or Cope elimination, developed by Arthur C. Cope, is the elimination reaction of an N-oxide to an alkene and a hydroxylamine.Typically, the amine oxide is prepared from the corresponding amine with a peroxy acid or comparable oxidant. The actual elimination requires just heat. 
Illustrative is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane:
==Mechanism and related eliminations==
The reaction proceeds through the Ei pathway, with an intramolecular, cyclic 5-membered transition state. Consequently, the elimination product is always &quot;syn&quot; and rarely occurs with 6-membered rings. (Rings with 5 or 7 or more members undergo the reaction just fine.) 

This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. Sulfoxides can undergo an essentially identical reaction to produce sulfenic acids, which is important in the antioxidant chemistry of garlic and other &quot;allium&quot;s. Selenoxides likewise undergo selenoxide eliminations.

==Reverse reaction==
The reverse or retro-Cope elimination has been reported, in which an N,N-disubstituted hydroxylamine reacts with an alkene to form a tertiary N-oxide. The reaction is a form of hydroamination and can be extended to the use of unsubstituted hydroxylamine, in which case oximes are produced.

<doc id="1125483" wikidata="Q3988247" url="?curid=1125483" title="The Masque">
<text>The Masque was a small punk rock club in central Hollywood, California which existed from 1977 to 1978. It is remembered as a key part of the early LA punk scene.
==History==
The Masque was founded by Scottish-American rock promoter Brendan Mullen, opening on August 18, 1977. It quickly became the nexus of the Los Angeles punk subculture. It was located in the basement of the Shane Building, with a secondary access point in the building&#x27;s neighboring pornographic movie theater.

Many California punk bands frequently performed there, including the Dickies, X, Germs, Bags, the Screamers, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Alley Cats, the Go-Go&#x27;s, Suburban Lawns, the Mau-Mau&#x27;s, the Weirdos, the Zeros, the Avengers, the Dils, the Skulls and the Controllers.

Rhino 39, one of Long Beach, California&#x27;s earliest punk rock bands, also played there often.

Several bands rented practice space at the Masque, including the Motels, the Controllers, Secrets, the Skulls and the Go-Go&#x27;s.

At least two compilation records featuring live performances at the Masque were released.

First generation punk fanzines like &quot;Flipside&quot; and &quot;Slash&quot; covered the scene at the Masque.

The original Masque was closed by fire marshals on January 14, 1978.

==After closing==
Mullen went on to open and promote shows at the Other Masque (aka New Masque and Masque 2), also located in Hollywood, from December 1978 through spring 1979. Bands appearing at The Other Masque included the Dead Boys (with local musicians backing Stiv Bators including Nicky Beat of the Weirdos), the Cramps (after moving from New York City), Wall of Voodoo, the Flyboys, the Crowd, the Mutants, Dead Kennedys, The Red Army, X, Germs and others. The loss of the Other Masque resulted in punk bands having to move to the Sunset Strip clubs like the Whisky a Go Go or Gazzari&#x27;s. This change in performance venues contributed to the fading of the LA punk scene in the early 1980s.

After the second Masque closed, Mullen opened Club Lingerie, which lasted until 1991.

The music video for &quot;Perfect&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins, filmed in 1998, featured The Masque and its original graffiti.

The building was renovated in 2001. While most of the walls were removed, the remaining walls in the basement (which now houses the World of Wonder archive) continue to display much of the original graffiti.

Mullen died of a stroke on October 12, 2009. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea wrote a two-page article on Mullen&#x27;s passing along with his memories of the Masque in an October 2009 article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Mullen had been one of the first club promoters to give the Chili Peppers their start in 1983, at Club Lingerie. The band included a tribute to Mullen, &quot;Brendan&#x27;s Death Song&quot;, on their 2011 album &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;.

Footage of the remnants of the Masque, as it appeared in 2015, was featured in the documentary &quot;Who Is Billy Bones?&quot;, which also included archival interview footage of Mullen discussing the formation of The Skulls.

<text>The Salt Lake City Public Library system&#x27;s main branch building is an architecturally unique structure in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is located at 210 East, 400 South, across from the Salt Lake City and County Building and Washington Square.

==History==

The Salt Lake City Public Library was originally housed in the Salt Lake City and County Building in 1898. Thanks to a donation of land and money by a John Quackenbos Packard in 1900, a new library was built in downtown Salt Lake City; the building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This building remained in use until the library outgrew it by the early 1960s. The city library was then moved to a new home across from the City and County Building at the intersection of 500 South and 200 East. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 28, 1962, and the building was dedicated on October 30, 1964. In 1965, the old library was renovated into the Hansen Planetarium, funded by a donation of $400,000 from Beatrice M. Hansen.

===1994 hostage incident===

On March 7, 1994, a gunman took several hostages in a conference room on the second floor of the old main branch building. The library was evacuated and SWAT teams were called in during a six-hour siege, which ended in the death of the gunman and the freeing of the hostages.

===Move to the current location===
After celebrating the library&#x27;s 100th anniversary in early 1998, an $84 million library bond was approved to relocate the library in a new building, north half a block, to its current location. The firm Moshe Safdie and Associates partnered with a local architecture firm, VCBO Architecture, to design the building, which opened to the public on February 8, 2003. The former building in Library Square houses The Leonardo, a museum of science, technology and creativity.

On September 15, 2006, a small bomb exploded in the third floor of the main building. No one was hurt, and the damage sustained by the building was a broken window. Eastbound traffic on the streets of 400 South and 200 East was closed as 400 people were forced to evacuate.

===Suicides and attempted suicides === 
There have been several public suicides at the library since its relocation. In April 2008, a woman jumped from the third floor balcony inside the library and died.

In July 2005, a woman jumped from the roof of the building to her death. In March 2011, a woman jumped from the fourth floor inside the building and died. In April 2012, a man jumped from the balcony inside the library to his death.

On June 10, 2013, at approximately 4pm, a 21-year-old man jumped to his death from the roof, prompting the closure of the library for the remainder of the day.

On November 13, 2013, at approximately 4:15pm, a 21-year-old man was witnessed jumping from the roof of the building. The man survived the fall and was taken to LDS Hospital for his injuries. The event prompted the closure of the library for the remainder of the day.

==Building==
The Salt Lake City main library covers an area of in a five-story tall, wedge-shaped building. The structure includes of concrete, and of glass, including a five-story curved glass outer wall. The Vancouver Public Library, also designed by Safdie, shares a similar design—most clearly apparent in the main foyer and the sweeping outer facade.

The building is housed within Library Square, a landscaped and paved plaza that encompasses the city block. Much of what is now landscaped, open space had been planned to be covered by outbuildings, but Rocky Anderson, Salt Lake City&#x27;s mayor at the time of the library&#x27;s opening, asked for these to be left out in favor of creating a public park. A later initiative to create a new headquarters for the Salt Lake City Police Department was also struck down and the building was subsequently placed a block east, directly across from library square. The square is also occupied by shops, a community writing center run by Salt Lake Community College, studios of radio station KUUB and, most notably, The Leonardo Museum, which is housed in the library&#x27;s former building. The Square itself is paved with limestone from Israel.

The entrance to the building&#x27;s interior leads to the &quot;Urban Room&quot;, a foyer that contains more shops and extends upward for all five floors, ending with a skylight.

The building is topped by a garden on the roof planted with trees, grasses, flowering bulbs and various perennial plants, as well as tended beehives. In addition, there is a community garden outside of the library&#x27;s ground floor and a &quot;seed library&quot; from which any patrons can receive seeds for their own gardening.

In 2006, the library received Library Journal&#x27;s &quot;Library of the Year&quot; award, largely based on the significance of the building.

Other notable features of the building include:

*Fireplaces on four of the floors and were designed to resemble a column of fire when viewed from 200 East and 400 South.
* A &quot;lens&quot; on the south side of the building, which helps to warm the building during the winter, and saves on heating costs.
* A gallery displaying works of local artists.
* A coffee shop with a private staircase providing direct access to the &quot;Canteena,&quot; an area which contains the young adult section.
* A children&#x27;s library that is visible from all floors and has special areas for children to read and for baby care.
* A spiral staircase and three glass elevators.
* The main building is shaped like a triangle or arrowhead and points directly at the Salt Lake Mormon Temple.

== Collection ==
The library&#x27;s collection comprises over 500,000 books, subscriptions to over 60 newspapers and magazines, an expansive digital library with a variety of resources, 163 internet-capable computers.

A notable item in the collection is a 19th century edition of John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;, which was purchased by the library in 1903. The copy is not an original print, rather, it is from a later run commissioned by Audubon&#x27;s son John in the 1850s. Unlike the first run, the copy&#x27;s illustrations are not hand-colored, but they are an early example of the then-revolutionary process of chromolithography.

<text>Al-Baqarah (, ; &quot;The Heifer&quot; or &quot;The Cow&quot;), also spelled as Al-Baqara, is the second and longest chapter (&quot;surah&quot;) of the Quran. It consists of 286 verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;) which begin with the &quot;muqatta&#x27;at&quot; letters &quot;alif&quot; ()&quot;, lām&quot; ()&quot;,&quot; and &quot;mīm&quot; (). The Verse of Loan, the longest single verse in the Quran, is in this chapter.

The sūrah encompasses a variety of topics and contains several commands for Muslims such as enjoining fasting on the believer during the month of Ramadan; forbidding interest or usury (&quot;riba&quot;); and several famous verses such as The Throne Verse, Al-Baqara 256, and the final two or three verses. The sūrah addresses a wide variety of topics, including substantial amounts of law, and retells stories of Adam, Ibrahim (Abraham) and Mūsa (Moses). A major theme is guidance: urging the pagans (Al-Mushrikeen) and the Jews of Medina to embrace Islam, and warning them and the hypocrites (Munafiqun) of the fate God had visited in the past on those who failed to heed his call.

&quot;Al-Baqara&quot; is believed by Muslims to have been revealed in a span of 10 years starting from 622 in Medina after the Hijrah, with the exception of the riba verses which Muslims believe were revealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage, the last Hajj of Muhammad. In particular, verse 281 in this chapter is believed to be the last verse of the Quran to be revealed, on the 10th day of &quot;Dhu al-Hijja&quot; 10 A.H., when Muhammad was in the course of performing his last Hajj, 80 or 90 days before he died.

==Theme and subject matter==
===1-7 God-fearing rewarded, Unbelievers reproved===
Following the &quot;muqatta&#x27;at&quot;, Al-Baqara begins with the declaration that the Quran is free of doubt and contains guidance for those who possess &quot;taqwa&quot;. Taqwā is grammatically linked to the triliteral root w-q-y evoking wariness, a sense of care and protection. These people, known as God-fearing (&quot;muttaqin&quot;), are defined as those who believe in &quot;al-ghaib&quot; (Unseen, ghayb, lit. “absent”), offer &quot;salah&quot;, spend &quot;zakat&quot; from what is provided to them, believe in Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood and that of the other prophets, and the books revealed to them.

There follows a description of the &quot;kafirs&quot; and &quot;munafiqs&quot;. The first of these verses uses the word &quot;kafir&quot; to describe one who conceals the truth, and Muhammad is advised that they will not believe despite his efforts because God has sealed their hearts and hearing, and covered their eyes (so that they will not be able to see, hear, or comprehend guidance), and that they will be punished with a great torment. Next is a detailed description of &quot;munafiqs,&quot; defined here as those who say they believe in God and the Last Judgment, but do not actually believe in them. It is said that they try to deceive God and the &quot;mumins&quot; (believers) but they deceive themselves without perception, that in their hearts is a disease which God increases, and that they will be punished with a painful torment. The &quot;munafiqs&quot; are also said to spread &quot;fasad&quot; (disorder/mischief) in the land, while claiming to spread peace, and to call the believers fools. To the believers they say they believe, but when they go back to their devils, they tell confess their disbelief, but they do not know that God deceives them and increases their deviation. They are then called those who engage in a profitless trade, the purchase of error with guidance. The &quot;munafiqs&quot; are then likened to a person who starts a fire and feels safe in its immediate surrounding, but God extinguishes the fire and the person is covered in darkness. The Quran then calls them deaf, dumb, and blind. Another example given is that of a person wandering in rain, thunder and lightning in darkness, such that they would have to thrust their fingers into their ears out of the fear of death. The lightning is so bright that it almost takes away their sight, but they walk toward it whenever it strikes, and stay put when it is dark.

Mankind is then asked to worship God to acquire &quot;taqwa&quot;, and a description of God&#x27;s creations follows: the earth as a resting place, the sky as a canopy, and rain sent from the sky to bring forth fruit and provision. They are then advised to not set up others in worship beside God. Those who doubt that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad are then challenged to produce a &quot;surah&quot; similar to it. It is then said that they will never be able to fulfill this challenge and are asked to fear Hell, which is described as being fueled with men and stones and specifically prepared for the &quot;kafirs&quot;.

The stories in this chapter are told to help the reader understand the theological conception of truth in Islam.

===8-20 The hypocrites===
Q2:8-20 in Surah Al Baqarah refer to the hypocrites (Munafiqun). In the Meccan phase of Muhammad, there existed two groups, the Believers and the Mushrikeen (non-believers). However, after Hijrah (Emigration to Medina) Muhammad had to deal with the opposition of those who openly accepted Islam while secretly plotting against Muslims. Their leader was Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy who was about to be crowned king before the arrival of Muhammad in Medina. The hypocrites benefitted from the Muslims while not losing their association with the disbelievers. They were considered disloyal to both parties and inclined towards those who benefited them the most in the worldly sense

The surah also sheds light on the concept of Nifaq, which is opposite of sincerity. It is of two types:

1) Nifaq in belief: outwardly showing belief however in reality there is no belief

2) Nifaq in practice: where people believe however they act like hypocrites. The signs of a hypocrite are lying, breaking promises, not keeping an amaanah or trust and when they argue they curse or use bad language.

According to a prominent scholar, Kamaluddin Ahmed, Nifaq is something that is within the heart, hence no one knows of its existence except God. Therefore, no one can be called a hypocrite or Munaafiq through one&#x27;s own self-assessment. This would amount to making Takfeer i.e. calling someone a Kafir (non-believer) since Nifaq (hypocrisy) in belief is kufr.

26 Commences with ۞ (&quot;rubʿ al-ḥizb&quot;), an Islamic symbol.

87-105 is preserved in the Ṣan‘ā’1 lower text. 
:&quot;Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive messengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. Why is it that every time a messenger comes to you ˹Israelites˺ with something you do not like, you become arrogant, rejecting some and killing others?&quot;()

Condemnation of alcoholic beverages and gambling is also first found in the chapter, and it is one of only four chapters in the Quran to refer to Christians as Nazarenes instead of the more frequent terms People of the Book or &quot;Helpers of Christ.&quot;

Al-Baqarah contains several verses dealing with the subject of warfare. Q are quoted on the nature of battle in Islam.

The surah includes a few Islamic rules related to varying subjects, such as: prayers, fasting, striving on the path of God, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the change of the direction of prayer (Qiblah) from Jerusalem to Mecca, marriage and divorce, commerce, debt, and a great many of the ordinances concerning interest or usury.

=== 255 &quot;The Throne Verse&quot; ===
Quran 2 includes many verses which have virtues like the special Verse of the Throne (Aayatul Kursi). Muhammad is reported to have said,

&quot;Do not turn your houses into graves. Verily, Satan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.&quot; [Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmed]

Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash-Sha&#x27;bi said that &#x27;Abdullah bin Mas&#x27;ud said, &quot;Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Satan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (), the following two Ayat () and the last three Ayat.&quot;

Verse 255 is &quot;The Throne Verse&quot; ( &quot;&quot;). It is the most famous verse of the Quran and is widely memorized and displayed in the Islamic world due to its emphatic description of God&#x27;s omnipotence in Islam.

===256 No compulsion in religion===

Verse 256 is one of the most quoted verses in the Quran. It famously notes that &quot;There is no compulsion in religion&quot;.

=== 282 &quot;Verse of Loan and Women&#x27;s testimony&quot; ===

Verse covers two specific Islamic jurisprudence issues: (1) undertaking a loan and (2) the status of women&#x27;s testimony.

Amin Ahsan Islahi in his &quot;Tafsir of Surah al-Baqarah&quot; says when there is a loan transaction for a specific period of time, it must be formally written down. Both the lender and the debtor must trust the writer. There must be two witnesses: two men, or one man and two women. The security of the writer must be guaranteed. The length of the contract should be stated exactly.
al-Jalalayn says, &quot;summon to bear witness the debt two witnesses men mature Muslim free men; or if the two witnesses be not men then one man and two women&quot;.

== Structure ==
The structure represents a chiastic organization commonly found in the Quran. A chiastic structure, or ring composition, arranges themes or ideas in a mirrored sequence (e.g., A-B-C-D-C’-B’-A’) to emphasize central points and highlight relationships between corresponding elements.

== Abraham (Ibrahim) ==
Page 19-21 tells the story of Abraham and his relationship with Mecca and his son. Abraham made a prayer to Allah that Mecca would be safe and prosperous for its people until the end of time (2:126). The next verses then talk about how Abraham and Ishmail built the Kaaba and their prayer that their offspring would be righteous Muslims and Allah would send to them prophets so that they may be guided (2:127-130). This chapter also reaffirms that Abraham was neither a Christian, Jew, nor polytheist, but rather a monotheist, who submitted to Allah (2:131-136). 

Later verses discuss the story of Abraham with the Nimrud (Nemrod) who refused to believe and professed himself to be God. Abraham brings forth to him the parable that Allah can bring the dead to life and let those alive be dead, and Nimrud responds by claiming he can do the same by killing someone. Abraham then brings the parable of how God raises the Sun from the East and challenged him to raise it from the West at which he was silenced. 

The final discussion of Abraham in this chapter, is when he asks of God to show him how he raises the dead (2:260).

==Musa==
Musa is referenced several times in Al-Baqara:
*Appraisals of Moses: 
*The prophet whom God spoke to: 
*The Torah: ; ; 
*Moses&#x27; miracle: , , , 
*Moses and the Pharaoh
**Moses and his followers were safe: 
**Pharaoh&#x27;s and his army: 
**The Pharaoh punished the Israelites: 
*Travel to the Promised Land
**The Israelites entered the Promised Land: 
**Moses&#x27; dialogue with God: 
**The Israelites worshipped the calf: , 
*Refusal of the Israelites: 
*Attributes of the Israelites: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;

<doc id="1125496" wikidata="Q898403" url="?curid=1125496" title="Pericyclic reaction">
<text>In organic chemistry, a pericyclic reaction is the type of organic reaction wherein the transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry, the reaction progresses in a concerted fashion, and the bond orbitals involved in the reaction overlap in a continuous cycle at the transition state. Pericyclic reactions stand in contrast to &quot;linear reactions&quot;, encompassing most organic transformations and proceeding through an acyclic transition state, on the one hand and &quot;coarctate reactions&quot;, which proceed through a doubly cyclic, concerted transition state on the other hand. Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement or addition reactions. The major classes of pericyclic reactions are given in the table below (the three most important classes are shown in bold). Ene reactions and cheletropic reactions are often classed as group transfer reactions and cycloadditions/cycloeliminations, respectively, while dyotropic reactions and group transfer reactions (if ene reactions are excluded) are rarely encountered.

In general, these are considered to be equilibrium processes, although it is possible to push the reaction in one direction by designing a reaction by which the product is at a significantly lower energy level; this is due to a unimolecular interpretation of Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle. There is thus a set of &quot;retro&quot; pericyclic reactions.

== Mechanism of pericyclic reaction==

By definition, pericyclic reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism involving a single, cyclic transition state. Because of this, prior to a systematic understanding of pericyclic processes through the &quot;principle of orbital symmetry conservation&quot;, they were facetiously referred to as &#x27;no-mechanism reactions&#x27;. However, reactions for which pericyclic mechanisms can be drawn often have related stepwise mechanisms proceeding through radical or dipolar intermediates that are also viable. Some classes of pericyclic reactions, such as the [2+2] ketene cycloaddition reactions, can be &#x27;controversial&#x27; because their mechanism is sometimes not definitively known to be concerted (or may depend on the reactive system). Moreover, pericyclic reactions also often have metal-catalyzed analogs, although usually these are also not technically pericyclic, since they proceed via metal-stabilized intermediates, and therefore are not concerted.

Despite these caveats, the theoretical understanding of pericyclic reactions is probably among the most sophisticated and well-developed in all of organic chemistry. The understanding of how orbitals interact in the course of a pericyclic process has led to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, a simple set of criteria to predict whether a pericyclic mechanism for a reaction is likely or favorable. For instance, these rules predict that the [4+2] cycloaddition of butadiene and ethylene under thermal conditions is likely a pericyclic process, while the [2+2] cycloaddition of two ethylene molecules is not. These are consistent with experimental data, supporting an ordered, concerted transition state for the former and a multistep radical process for the latter. Several equivalent approaches, outlined below, lead to the same predictions.

The aromatic transition state theory assumes that the minimum energy transition state for a pericyclic process is aromatic, with the choice of reaction topology determined by the number of electrons involved. For reactions involving (4&quot;n&quot; + 2)-electron systems (2, 6, 10, ... electrons; odd number of electron pairs), Hückel topology transition states are proposed, in which the reactive portion of the reacting molecule or molecules have orbitals interacting in a continuous cycle with an even number of nodes. In 4&quot;n&quot;-electron systems (4, 8, 12, ... electrons; even number of electron pairs) Möbius topology transition states are proposed, in which the reacting molecules have orbitals interacting in a &quot;twisted&quot; continuous cycle with an odd number of nodes. The corresponding (4&quot;n&quot; + 2)-electron Möbius and 4&quot;n&quot;-electron Hückel transition states are antiaromatic and are thus strongly disfavored. Aromatic transition state theory results in a particularly simply statement of the generalized Woodward–Hoffmann rules: A pericyclic reaction involving an odd number of electron pairs will proceed through a Hückel transition state (even number of antarafacial components in Woodward–Hoffmann terminology), while a pericyclic reaction involving an even number of electron pairs will proceed through a Möbius transition state (odd number of antarafacial components). 

Equivalently, pericyclic reactions have been analyzed with correlation diagrams, which track the evolution of the molecular orbitals (known as &#x27;correlating&#x27; the molecular orbitals) of the reacting molecules as they progress from reactants to products via a transition state, based on their symmetry properties. Reactions are favorable (&#x27;allowed&#x27;) if the ground state of the reactants correlate with the ground state of the products, while they are unfavorable (&#x27;forbidden&#x27;) if the ground state of the reactants correlate with an excited state of the products. This idea is known as the &quot;conservation of orbital symmetry&quot;. Consideration of the interactions of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (frontier orbital analysis) is another approach to analyzing the transition state of a pericyclic reaction.

=== Arrow-pushing for pericyclic reactions ===
The arrow-pushing convention for pericyclic reactions has a somewhat different meaning compared to polar (and radical) reactions. For pericyclic reactions, there is often no obvious movement of electrons from an electron rich source to an electron poor sink. Rather, electrons are redistributed around a cyclic transition state. Thus, electrons can be pushed in either of two directions for a pericyclic reaction. For some pericyclic reactions, however, there is a definite polarization of charge at the transition state due to asynchronicity (bond formation and breaking do not occur to a uniform extent at the transition state). Thus, one direction may be preferred over another, although arguably, both depictions are still formally correct. In the case of the Diels-Alder reaction shown below, resonance arguments make clear the direction of polarization. In more complex situations, however, detailed computations may be needed to determine the direction and extent of polarization.

=== Pseudopericyclic processes ===
Closely related to pericyclic processes are reactions that are pseudopericyclic. Although a &quot;pseudopericyclic reaction&quot; proceeds through a cyclic transition state, two of the orbitals involved are constrained to be orthogonal and cannot interact. Perhaps the most famous example is the hydroboration of an olefin. Although this appears to be a 4-electron Hückel topology forbidden group transfer process, the empty p orbital and sp2 hybridized B–H bond are orthogonal and do not interact. Hence, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not apply. (The fact that hydroboration is believed to proceed through initial π complexation may also be relevant.)

== In biochemistry ==

Pericyclic reactions also occur in several biological processes:

*Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate in almost all prototrophic organisms
*[1,5]-sigmatropic shift in the transformation of precorrin-8x to hydrogenobyrinic acid
*non-enzymatic, photochemical electrocyclic ring opening and a (1,7) sigmatropic hydride shift in vitamin D synthesis
*Isochorismate pyruvate lyase catalyzed conversion of isochorismate into salicylate and pyruvate

<text>Châteauneuf-du-Pape () is a French wine, an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) located around the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the Rhône wine region in southeastern France. It is one of the most renowned appellations of the southern part in the Rhône Valley, and its vineyards are located around Châteauneuf-du-Pape and in neighboring villages, Bédarrides, Courthézon and Sorgues, between Avignon and Orange. They cover slightly more than 3,200 hectares or and produce over 110,000 hectolitres of wine a year, more wine made in this one area of the southern Rhône than in all of the northern Rhône.

==History==
Châteauneuf-du-Pape literally translates to &quot;The Pope&#x27;s new castle&quot; and, indeed, the history of this appellation is firmly entwined with papal history. In 1309, Pope Clement V, former Archbishop of Bordeaux, relocated the papacy to the town of Avignon. Clement V and subsequent &quot;Avignon Popes&quot; were said to be great lovers of Burgundy wines and did much to promote them during the 70-year Avignon Papacy.

At the time, wine-growing around the town of Avignon was anything but illustrious. While the Avignon Papacy did much to advance the reputation of Burgundy wines, they also promoted viticulture of the surrounding area, more specifically the area north of Avignon close to the banks of the Rhône. Prior to the Avignon Papacy, viticulture of that area had been initiated and maintained by the Bishops of Avignon but largely for local consumption.

John XXII, who succeeded Clement V, in addition to Burgundy wine, regularly drank wine from the vineyards to the north and did much to improve viticultural practices there. Under John XXII, the wines of this area came to be known as &quot;Vin du Pape&quot;, this term later becoming &quot;Châteauneuf-du-Pape&quot;. John XXII also built the castle which is the symbol of the appellation.

In the 18th century, the wines were shipped under the name &quot;vin d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. 

Records from the early 19th century mention wines of the name &quot;Châteauneuf-du-Pape-Calcernier&quot; which seems to have been a lighter-style wine than the Châteauneuf-du-Pape of today. They seem to have increased in reputation within France until phylloxera hit in the early 1870&#x27;s which was earlier than most other French wine regions were affected. Prior to World War I, the bulk of Châteauneuf-du-Pape was sold to Burgundy as &quot;vin de médecine&quot; to be added to Burgundy wine to boost the strength and alcohol levels.

===Early AOC regulations===
In the early 20th century, Châteauneuf-du-Pape was plagued by wine fraud; various rules for the production of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, drawn up and promulgated in 1923, were the first Appellation Contrôlée rules in France and provided the prototype for subsequent AOC rules. The original AOC rules allowed ten varieties, were amended to thirteen in 1936 and eighteen in 2009. Baron Pierre le Roy of Château Fortia was the principal architect of these regulations which set the minimum alcohol level of the wines and set limits on yields as well as which types of grapes could be grown in which areas. 

Another of the baron&#x27;s requirements was that no vineyards were to be planted on land that was not arid enough to support plantings of both lavender and thyme.

In 1954, there was a media sensation as local stories claimed that &quot;flying cigars&quot;, or UFOs similar to flying saucers, had been spotted above Châteauneuf-du-Pape and that aliens were interested in their wine. Local politicians, said to be sensing an opportunity to promote the region&#x27;s wines, passed a law banning flying cigars from entering their airspace or landing on their territory, a law which remains in effect to this day. The legend has become lore among wine aficionados, and the wine Cigare Volant (French for &quot;flying cigar&quot;), in production since 1984, is named after the tale.

== Climate and geography ==
The appellation stretches from the eastern bank of the Rhône near Orange in the north-west to Sorgues near Avignon in the south-east. The altitude reaches 120 meters at its highest, in the northern part of the appellation. It covers 3200 hectares of land with at least three distinct types of soil or &quot;terroirs&quot;. In the north and north-east the famous &quot;galets roulés&quot;, round rocks or pebbles, cover the clay soil. The rocks are famous for retaining the heat from the plentiful sun, some 2800 hours a year, releasing it at night, ripening the grapes faster than in the eastern part of the appellation, where the soil is mostly sand, or the south, where the soil is more gritty. The powerful &quot;mistral&quot; wind carries away the moisture, intensifying the dry climate.

=== &quot;Terroir&quot; ===
The characteristic &quot;terroir&quot; of Châteauneuf-du-Pape comes from a layer of stones called &quot;Galets roulés&quot; (&quot;pebbles&quot;). The rocks are typically quartzite and remnants of Alpine glaciers that have been smoothed over millennia by the Rhône. The stone retains heat during the day and releases it at night which can have an effect of hastening the ripening of grapes. The stones can also serve as a protective layer to help retain moisture in the soil during the dry summer months. Some of the most prestigious vineyards in the area, like Château Rayas, have more traditional looking vineyards without the &quot;galets&quot;. These are most often vineyards located on south-facing slopes where the night-time radiated heat from the stones would be detrimental to the vines and cause overripening of the grapes.

===La Crau===
La Crau is one of Châteauneuf-du-Pape&#x27;s most famous &quot;lieux-dits&quot; vineyards. The vineyard is owned primarily by Domaine du Vieux Télégraphe, one of the most classic Châteauneufs, but also producer Henri Bonneau maintains a firm position here. The vineyard is very rich in the aforementioned &quot;galets roulés&quot;, while Domaine du Vieux Lazaret with its over 100 hectares owned by Vignobles Jérôme Quiot is the largest.

==Wine==
Châteauneuf-du-Pape can be either red or white wine, but the large majority of the wines produced are red. The appellation rules did not until recently allow production of rosé.

The wines have traditionally been packaged in distinctive heavy dark wine bottles embossed with papal regalia and insignia. However, in recent times a number of producers have dropped the full papal seal in favour of a more generic icon, while still retaining the same heavy glassware.

===Grape varieties===

Châteauneuf-du-Pape traditionally has had thirteen grape varieties, but the 2009 version of the AOC rules changed that list to eighteen varieties, since &quot;blanc&quot; (white), &quot;rose&quot; (pink) and &quot;noir&quot; (black) versions of some grapes are now explicitly listed as separate varieties. Also in the previous version of the appellation rules, Grenache and Picpoul were associated with different pruning regulations in their &quot;noir&quot; and &quot;blanc&quot; versions, bringing the number of varieties previously mentioned from thirteen to fifteen.

Red varieties allowed are Cinsault, Counoise, Grenache noir, Mourvèdre, Muscardin, Piquepoul noir, Syrah, Terret noir, and Vaccarèse (Brun Argenté). White and pink varieties are Bourboulenc, Clairette blanche, Clairette rose, Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Picardan, Piquepoul blanc, Piquepoul gris, and Roussanne. (The varieties not specifically mentioned before 2009 are Clairette rose, Grenache gris and Piquepoul gris.)

Both red and white varieties are allowed in both red and white Châteauneuf-du-Pape. There are no restrictions as to the proportion of grape varieties to be used, and unlike the case with other appellations, the allowed grape varieties are not differentiated into principal varieties and accessory varieties. Thus, it is theoretically possible to produce varietal Châteauneuf-du-Pape from any of the eighteen allowed varieties. In reality, most Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines are blends dominated by Grenache. Only one of every 16 bottles produced in the region contains white wine.

With 72% of the total vineyard surface in 2004, Grenache noir is very dominant, followed by Syrah at 10.5% and Mourvèdre at 7%, both of which have expanded in recent decades. Cinsaut, Clairette, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and Bourboulenc each cover 1-2.5%, and the remaining seven varieties each account for 0.5% or less.

It is common to grow the vines as &quot;gobelets&quot; and this is the only vine training system allowed for the first four red varieties. Yields are restricted to two tons per acre.

===Red wines===

In most red Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety, although some producers use a higher proportion of Mourvèdre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourvèdre can add elegance and structure to the wine. Some estates produce varietal (100%) Grenache noir, while a few producers insist on using at least a token amount of all thirteen originally permitted varieties in their blend. One of the few estates to grow all these varieties and use them consistently in a blend is Château de Beaucastel.

Châteauneuf-du-Pape red wines are often described as earthy with gamey flavors that have hints of tar and leather. The wines are considered tough and tannic in their youth but maintain their rich spiciness as they age. The wines often exhibit aromas of dried herbs common in Provence under the name of &quot;garrigue&quot;. Châteauneuf-du-Pape dominated by Mourvèdre tend to be higher in tannin and requiring longer cellaring before being approachable.

===White wines===
White Châteauneuf-du-Pape is produced by excluding the red varieties and only using the six permitted white varieties. The white varieties account for 7 percent of total plantings according to 2004 statistics, and a portion of the whites grapes are blended into red wines, which means that white wine production only accounts for around 5 percent of the total. In white Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache blanc and Roussanne provides fruitiness and fatness to the blend while Bourboulenc, Clairette and Picpoul add acidity, floral and mineral notes. The style of these wines range from lean and minerally to oily and rich with a variety of aromas and flavor notes—including almond, star fruit, anise, fennel, honeysuckle and peach. A single varietal, Roussanne, that is matured in an oak aging barrel, is also made by some estates. Most whites are made to be drunk young. Some white Châteauneuf-du-Pape are meant to age and tend to develop exotic aromas and scents of orange peels after 7–8 years.

===Winemaking styles===

Châteauneuf-du-Pape wines are often high in alcohol, typically 14-15.5%, and must be minimum 12.5% under the appellation rules with no chaptalization allowed. Winemaking in the region tends to focus on balancing the high sugar levels in the grape with the tannins and phenols that are common in red Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Following harvest, the grape clusters are rarely destemmed prior to fermentation. The fermentation temperatures are kept high, with the skins being frequently pumped over and punched down for the benefit of tannin levels and color extraction to achieve the characteristic dark Châteauneuf color. Beginning in the 1970s, market tendencies to prefer lighter, fruitier wines that can be drank sooner have prompted some estates to experiment with carbonic maceration. Low yields are considered critical to the success of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the principal grape varieties tending to make thin and bland wine when produced in higher quantities. The AOC requirements limit yields to 368 gallons per acre, which is nearly half the yields allowed in Bordeaux.

The common technique of using small barrel oak is not widely used in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape area, partly due to the fact that the principal grape Grenache is prone to oxidation in the porous wooden barrels. Instead, Grenache is vinified in large cement tanks, while the other grape varieties are made in large old barrels called &quot;foudres&quot; that do not impart the same &quot;oaky&quot; characteristics as the smaller oak barrels.

<doc id="1125506" wikidata="Q7799409" url="?curid=1125506" title="Thursday Afternoon">
<text>Thursday Afternoon is the tenth solo studio album by English musician Brian Eno, released in October 1985 on EG Records. Consisting of one 60-minute eponymous composition, it is the rearranged soundtrack to an 80-minute video production of the same title made in 1984.

== Background ==

Since recording &quot;Discreet Music&quot; in 1975, Eno had shown a strong interest in creating music that can influence the atmosphere of the space in which it is played, rather than be focused on directly. The &quot;Thursday Afternoon&quot; video was conceived as a series of seven &quot;video paintings&quot; which can be looked at in passing without demanding full attention from the viewer. Each of the segments depicts simple imagery that has been treated with visual effects, much in the same way as Eno&#x27;s music is often made up of simple instrumental performances that have been treated with audio effects. The work was filmed on a Thursday afternoon and named as such.

&quot;Thursday Afternoon&quot; consists of multiple tracks of processed piano and electronic textures. The layers of the composition are phased so that their relationships to each other are constantly changing in a way similar to his previous &quot;Discreet Music&quot; piece. The album was also one of the first to take advantage of the (then new) extended running time of the compact disc format, containing only one 60-min track.

== Composition ==

At just one track lasting 60 minutes, the music is ambient: beatless, flowing and ethereal. Remixing and rearranging from the soundtrack to suit the CD medium, Eno stated: &quot;... the music wasn&#x27;t recorded digitally. It was recorded on a 24-track analogue machine, and then digitally mastered.&quot;

An acoustic piano plays a series of notes and simple chords against a background of synths, which eventually dominate the entire soundscape. Though the composition sounds &quot;static&quot;, in the sense that its length makes it seem like a solid &quot;lump&quot; of sound, it features many unstable elements that change in both timbre and volume over its entirety.

== Music video ==

The original video, made at the request of and released by the Sony Corporation of America, was filmed in San Francisco in April 1984 and treated and assembled at Sony in Tokyo. Produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, it features seven &quot;video paintings&quot; of actress and photographer Christine Alicino, a friend of Eno&#x27;s, and has a running time of 82 minutes. It was filmed in &quot;vertical format,&quot; which necessitated the viewer either lie on their side or turn the television on its side, which often proved impractical for many viewers, and it most affected the picture tube&#x27;s color purity adjustments. The DVD reissue presents it in both portrait and landscape formats so that this is no longer necessary. The soundtrack was recorded at Lanois&#x27;s studio in Canada and is a longer, different mix.

The content is a series of images that stay static for some time and then slowly move forward, often to pause again. Various video techniques were implemented, such as image feedback, to create a very different interpretation of video and the nude.

Eno himself was aware of the newness of what he was doing. &quot;I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here&#x27;s video which draws from another source, which is painting ... I call them &quot;video paintings&quot; because if you say to people &quot;I make videos&quot;, they think of Sting&#x27;s new rock video or some really boring, grimy &quot;Video Art&quot;. It&#x27;s just a way of saying &quot;I make videos that don&#x27;t move very fast&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Cathay de Grande was a Chinese restaurant and later a Hollywood nightclub of the same name that featured mostly punk rock bands but also other styles of underground/alternative rock in the 1980s. 

== History ==
Under the ownership of Jack Chen, the Cathay de Grande restaurant and its underground basement nightclub opened in December 1973, serving Mandarin cuisine. By 1980, new owner Michael Brennan had taken over, serving Thai food and booking punk and New Wave bands such as the Raybeats, Angry Samoans, the Flesh Eaters, and the Gun Club. 

== Notable acts ==
Red Hot Chili Peppers performed their very first show under that band name at the Cathay after going by the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem for their two previous performances at another Hollywood club. They would play the Cathay a few times during their first tour in 1983 and once in 1984.

Other bands who frequently played the Cathay included The Minutemen, Bad Religion, Tex and the Horseheads, Geza X and the Mommymen, Dr. Know, The WILD, Entropy, along with regulars from Orange County Social Distortion, T.S.O.L., The Vandals, Agent Orange. and Love Canal. The Knitters played their first gig at the Cathay.

Starting around August 1981, Top Jimmy &amp; The Rhythm Pigs had a residency playing &quot;Blue Mondays&quot; every Monday night.

The Replacements and Butthole Surfers were among the national touring bands who came through the venue.

== Closure and legacy ==
Due to ongoing problems with neighbors, intervention by the local police, and legal problems related to business conflicts, proprietor Michael Brennan closed the Cathay de Grande in 1985. It was one of the last remaining punk venues at the time of its closure. Violent Psychosis, The Mentors with El Duce, and Circle Jerks performed the venue&#x27;s farewell show. Shortly before, Danny &quot;Dobbs&quot; Wilson, a booker at the Cathay de Grande, started Raji&#x27;s a block to the north on Hollywood Boulevard.

The nightclub space later became home to the more upscale China Club.

In the song &quot;The Desperation&#x27;s Gone&quot; from the NOFX album &quot;So Long And Thanks For All The Shoes&quot;, Fat Mike sings &quot;Cathay de, I miss your smell.&quot;

In 2014, a nightclub called The Argyle opened at the location. That venue has since closed.
