<text>Tyneham is a ghost village abandoned in 1943 and former civil parish, now in the parish of Steeple with Tyneham, in the Dorset district, in the south of Dorset, England, near Lulworth on the Isle of Purbeck. In 2001 the civil parish had a population of 0. The civil parish was abolished on 1 April 2014 and merged with Steeple to form Steeple with Tyneham.

==Location==

The village is situated northeast of Worbarrow Bay on the Jurassic Coast, about south of Wareham and about west of Swanage. The village lies in a secluded east–west valley between two ridges of the Purbeck Hills. To the north is the main ridge with Povington Hill () and its highest point, Ridgeway Hill (). To the south is the ridge above Gad Cliff that runs from the headland of Worbarrow Tout in the west to the knoll of Tyneham Cap () in the east.

==Access==
Tyneham is only accessible when the Lulworth Ranges are open to the public. The military firing ranges are owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School. Safety warnings about explosives and unexploded shells are posted at Mupe Bay by the MoD: visitors are advised to keep to official footpaths and observe local site notices because tanks and armoured vehicles are used in this area.

==History==
The parish includes evidence of occupation dating back to Iron Age Britain; there are more than 30 barrows in the area, although most have been damaged by shelling. Proof of Roman occupation has also been found in the valley around Tyneham and there were salt-boiling, shale-turning and Purbeck Marble industries at Worbarrow Bay. South of the chalk ridge are remains of a medieval settlement and strip fields.

It seems that it was once the possession of Robert, Count of Mortain, the half-brother of William I of England. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Tigeham&quot;, meaning &quot;goat enclosure&quot;. A century later, the village was known as Tiham and only in later times as Tyneham. The limestone church of St Mary dates from at least the 15th century, and Tyneham House was built by Henry Williams between 1563 and 1583.

In 1683 Nathaniel Bond (1634–1707) of Lutton acquired Tyneham from the Williams family. He also bought Creech Grange in 1691 and the family still hold their Purbeck estates. Tyneham school was established by the Reverend Nathaniel Bond (1804–89) in 1860. It was later declared as property of the rectory and was closed in 1932 due to lack of pupils.

The village and of surrounding heathland and chalk downland around the Purbeck Hills were requisitioned just before Christmas 1943 by the then War Office (now MoD) for use as firing ranges for training troops. 225 people were displaced, the last person leaving a notice on the church door:

This measure was supposed to be temporary for the duration of World War II, but in 1948 the Army placed a compulsory purchase order on the land and it has remained in use for military training ever since. Although littered with scrap used as targets and subject to regular shelling, the land has become a haven for wildlife as it has been free from farming and development. In 1975, after complaints from tourists and locals, the Ministry of Defence began opening the village and footpaths across the ranges at weekends and throughout August.

Many of the village buildings have fallen into disrepair or have been damaged by shelling. In 1967, most of the manor house, with parts that dated back to the 14th century, was pulled down by the then Ministry of Works. The building&#x27;s east front was reconstructed at Athelhampton, with smaller parts moved to Melcombe Horsey and Bingham&#x27;s Melcombe. The church of St Mary, however, remains largely intact; it has a stained-glass window by Martin Travers and memorials to the Bond family, but the 17th century pulpit was moved to Lulworth Camp and the plate to Kimmeridge. The church and school house have since been preserved as museums. The church, school and drinking fountain are all grade II listed buildings. In 2008, Tyneham Farm was reopened to the public and conservation work there is ongoing.

==Film and literature==
In 1985 the village was used for the filming of &quot;Comrades&quot;, which depicts the story of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. The church had a fibreglass tower and large additional gravestones and Post Office Row was fronted with fibreglass cottages. During the filming Tyneham&#x27;s original 1929 K1 Mark 236 telephone kiosk was destroyed and the film company sourced a replacement.

The village is the setting for the climax to the comic-thriller &quot;Angel&#x27;s Share&quot; by Mike Ripley (2006).

Tyneham is featured in episode 5 of the first season of &quot;Life After People&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, in which its existence as a settlement suddenly abandoned by its residents is examined.

The village is the setting for the novel &quot;The Forgotten Village&quot; by Lorna Cook (2019).

The history of the village is the premise for the novel, &quot;This Ruined Place&quot; (originally published for young adults as &quot;Juby&#x27;s Rook&quot;) by Michael Lawrence (2023).

<text>The Australian High Tech Crime Centre (AHTCC) are hosted by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) at their headquarters in Canberra. Under the auspices of the AFP, the AHTCC is party to the formal Joint Operating Arrangement established between the AFP, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Computer Network Vulnerability Team of the Australian Signals Directorate.

The AHTCC is an Australian-wide policing initiative to coordinate the efforts of Australian law enforcement in combating serious, complex and multi-jurisdictional Internet-based crimes, particularly those beyond the capability of individual police agencies in Australia. Other roles include protecting the information infrastructure of Australia, and providing information to other law enforcement to help combat online crime.

Technological advancements, and greater internet accessibility, has seen a growth in cyber criminality. The Australian Federal Police have established the Australian High Tech Crime Centre to prevent such crimes from occurring in the digital space. State and community police work in corporation with the AFP to combat cyber crime.

==Overview==

Technology and its advancements, including greater and broader internet accessibility, have boosted cybercrime. The AFP established the AHTCC to cease and prevent online fraudulent behaviour. State and community police work incorporation with the AFP to combat digital crime.

AHTCC was established in July 2003, to investigate online fraudulent matters and is currently directed by Kevin Zuccato. The AHTCC, today, continues to fight against cybercrime. Commonwealth Laws outline the Cybercrime regulations in Australia.

Cybercrime is defined by the AFP as  “crimes directed at computers or other information communications technologies (ICTs) (such as computer intrusions and denial of service attacks), and crimes where computers or ICTs are an integral part of an offence (such as online fraud)”.

Digital attacks are often conducted by cyber adversaries, who are individuals or groups of people that specialize in conducting cyberattacks, online crime and malicious activity. Their activities destroy online businesses and networks and can compromise public or private data.

Malicious cyber activity is a risk for organisations and governments, including but not limited to, businesses that hold public data. In 1991, the World-wide-web was developed and shared. This allowed crime to occur through the internet, as well as offline. Online interactions and user relationships have heightened the ability of cybercrime to manifest and spread.

AHTCC&#x27;s main role is to ‘discover levels of online criminal activity’ and to undertake necessary measures to prevent or combat digital crime (Platypus, 2009, p. 7). AHTCC has partnered with large corporations, and work&#x27;s alongside Australia&#x27;s policing system to effectively manage web-based criminal schemes. The AFP conduct initiatives, like publishing reports that detail how the public should prevent cybercrime. These reports educate businesses on the possible threats of online transactions, customer communications, and other digital tools. The AHTCC&#x27;s website has a section for victims of digital offences to report and request help from the federal police.

Notably, AHTCC has mitigated online criminality and effectively maintained a high level of mediation for cybercrime prevention. The AHTCC deals with different groups of cybercrime including but not limited to, hackers, viruses, scammers, identity thieves, and online terrorists. In 2008, the AFP launched the High Tech Crimes Operations (HTCO) to investigate Child sex crimes and digital acts of child exploitation. The exploitation of children online continues to be an issue globally.

The AFP has several organisations that deal with online criminality. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), which is operated by the Australian Government, specialises in digital safety and security and works closely with the AHTCC to fight cybercrime. The ACSC allows the public and private to join forces to resolving cyber threats and possible attacks. The AFP also work with Defense Signals Directorate (DSD) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) to effectively manage cyber-attacks that would harm Australia&#x27;s business environment and public sphere.

==History==
The AHTCC was established in 2003, as a response to the rapid rise in digital usage and technological capabilities. The growth in Internet potential provided new capacities for criminals to engage in online fraudulent activities. Cybercrime has been existent since 1978 when the internet was first established and dispersed. Security systems have realised the need for continuous data moderation, and the monitoring of user activity online and offline. With the rise of e-commerce transactions a ‘dark’ web/ ‘black market’ has emerged and targets users of internet.

In 2003, at the beginning of the AHTCC, the centre had a budget of $4 million per annum and was operated by 13 staff, currently, the AFP has 258 staff working in technology and innovation and 319 in the security sector, with a total of 6695 staff across the board.

The AHTCC and the AFP have adapted their work in line with the rise in web use. In 1991, the police were able to make video and audio records of interviews, as a new wave of digital records emerged. To this day, the AFP is extremely present online, focusing on detecting criminals before they know they have been detected (AFP, 2020). Cybercrime prevention is an expensive exercise for the AFP. As of 2013, there were an estimated 10 billion devices connected to the internet, and with this increasing digital usage, comes more targeted attacks and criminal possibilities. The security software company, Symantec Corporation, estimates that, in 2010, cybercrime cost US$388 billion in losses, globally. (Weber, 2014, p. 54).

The Cybercrime Act was introduced by the Australian Government in 2001, outlining online offences prohibited. Statistically, cybercrime is significantly impacting Australians. In 2015, 1 in 4 Australians reported being victims of Identity theft (Veda Report, 2015).
In 2015, Australia had a significant data breach from overseas, an Australian Insurance company was the target of a cyberattack, in which criminals gained access to prohibited government systems and compromised the finances of notable businesses, damaging Australia&#x27;s security systems. The AFP solved this.  The AFP is working closely with Australians to avoid cybercrime. “Veda’s research from 2015 found that 95% of Australians were taking some kind of active precaution to protect their identity” (Veda Report, 2015).

==Australia&#x27;s Approach==
Australia follows the Commonwealth cybercrime regime, a legislative system that formed the CyberCrime Act 2011, an Act that considered computer crimes, traditional offline offences committed online, digital data misuse and other internet criminality. This Act has been amended, in 2012 it was changed to the Cybercrime Amendment Act, expanding its definition of cyber offences, as the online criminal possibilities broadened.

However, the current cybercrime policies in Australia, do not acknowledge ‘computer fraud’ as a criminal offence under the commonwealth law.  ‘Given the borderless nature of cybercrime, it is an oversight to not have a national approach to computer related fraud’ (Weber, p. 68).

==Roles and Functions==

Cybercrime takes numerous forms, including identity theft, digital scams, hacking, online fraud, and phishing. It is the role of the AHTCC in conjunction with the AFP and several other government corporations, to prevent and reduce criminal behaviour online.

The AFP is in a partnership with the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT), which includes major countries and organisations, who join forces in combating cybercrime. Globally, they tackle international digital offences. Cybercrime is not just personal account hacking, but can involve breaching security of government cooperation&#x27;s and networks, having a broader national impact.

The Australian Government established The Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN) to allow victims of cybercrime to report the occurrences and likewise for organisations. In 2015, ACORN recorded 39, 491 cybercrime incidents, and similarly, &quot;Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commander David McLean reported that, in one month alone, over 3,500 people had contacted police about perceived cyber-crime&quot; (Broadhurst, 2017).

There is widespread dissemination of pornographic content on the internet. User anonymity is used to conduct this behaviour, as tracing the criminal behind the crime is difficult. Some estimates suggest that 20,000 images of child porn are posted online each week (Broadhurst, 2017). Importantly, the AHTCC is taking effect against child abuse material, which has continued to circulate on the internet. The Australian police are focusing closely on child predators, targeting criminals that are a threat to society, to keep the online community safe and free from malicious and dangerous offences. Users who access and choose to view illegal content online are considered in the eyes of the Australian Law, as guilty as those who publish the footage, and thus are not free from prosecution themselves. Educating the public on these offences is part of the Australian Government security initiatives.

Technologies are helping the AFP combat cybercrime. In April 2016, The Australian Prime Minister allocated resources and financial expenditure of A$230 million to fund cybercrime and security measures under the AHTCC operations. Funding is important for the safety of businesses and individuals.

==Notable Cases==
The Australian Federal Police established the AHTCC to effectively control and manage cybercrime. The AFP has thus far, been successful in this field. According to the AFP, ‘over the past two years, more than 300 Australians have been arrested and charged in relation to the online sexual exploitation of children’ and concurrently, children posed as a risk to criminals were freed from danger and educated (AFP, 2020). A large part of cybercrime is Pedophilia. Organisations of International pedophiles use digital devices and platforms to exploit children, through strategies like webcams and online mechanisms like anonymity.

The AFP&#x27;s budget is extensive, to cover a vast number of cybercrime cases and solutions. In 2014, An online Russian crime syndicate hacked Australian companies and accessed 500,000 Australian&#x27;s financial details. The AHTCC arrested members of the gang, with seven criminals being in Victoria and thirteen in Spain. The AHTCC was responsible for combating this fraudulent activity effectively, avoiding the major crime from damaging the Australian economy and the broader national impact. The AHTCC is capable of managing domestic and international cybercrime and will work alongside large nations to develop plans of combat.

Recently, the AHTCC was highly successful in a case known as ‘Operation Carpo’, whereby a Western Australian man was prosecuted for withholding 56,000 credit card details, 53,000 usernames and passwords and 110,000 domain names. The success of this case, prevented several other organised cybercrime&#x27;s in Australia (AFP).

==The Future==
Australia is facing an increase in cyber criminality because of new technologies that can be defeated and maliciously targeted. The Australian Government continues to develop and improve its digital infrastructure and security, but loopholes are discovered by crime groups. In Australia, there is wealth and a high use of digital devices, which attracts criminality to our organisations and businesses. Further, there is a lack of information reported about cybercrime, which proposes difficulty for government bodies, like the AHTCC, to investigate and resolve the problem.

As technology continues to dominate the marketplace, the AHTCC will be vitally needed. The AFP will always require investigatory teams, such as the AHTCC to mitigate cyber criminality. The AFP declare that “Our ongoing commitment is to stay at least one step ahead of the criminals who are involved in any form of online crime” (AFP, 2020).

The Government, in 2016, introduced the Cyber Security Strategy, worth more than $230 million, to improve and maintain nation-wide digital security. One of the initiatives of this program was to increase the number of cyber security workers, and equip more professionals with the necessary tools and skills to uphold these qualifications. Institutions were set up to offer cybersecurity courses, and to ensure Australia remains at the front line with digital crime and technological advancements.

The director of AHTCC, Kevin Zuccato, works nationally with other countries to establish cyber-security on a global scale. The AHTCC is part of the Strategic Alliance Cyber Crime Working Group, which focuses on transnational cybercrime and building strong global relationships between countries and governments to combat world-wide cyber-attacks together.

The Australian Government has also implemented numerous measures and strategies to prevent cybercrime, including, but not limited to, risk reduction protocols, multi-stakeholder approaches to internet governing, internet neutrality, supporting human rights online, improve connectivity, technology innovation and digital-ready workforces.

All cyber defenders must work closely together to minimise cyber criminality. To do so, Australians and their businesses must report any security breached incidents to the Australian Federal Police, who will provide advice and assistance in preventing such crimes from occurring in the future. Further, the AFP requires the reporting of cybercrime offences as it provides needed information in order to seize all criminal behaviour online.

<text>Tamika Devonne Catchings (born July 21, 1979) is an American retired professional basketball player who played her entire 15-year career for the Indiana Fever of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Widely considered as one of the greatest female basketball players and one of the most decorated players in WNBA history, Catchings has won a WNBA championship (2012), WNBA Most Valuable Player Award (2011), WNBA Finals MVP Award (2012), five WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards (2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012), four Olympic gold medals (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016), the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award (2002), and an NCAA championship with the University of Tennessee Lady Vols (1998). She is one of only 11 women to receive an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA Championship, a FIBA World Cup gold and a WNBA Championship. She has also been selected to ten WNBA All-Star teams, 12 All-WNBA teams, 12 All-Defensive teams and led the league in steals eight times. In 2011, Catchings was voted in by fans as one of the WNBA&#x27;s Top 15 Players of All Time, and would be named to two more all-time WNBA teams, the WNBA Top 20@20 in 2016 and The W25 in 2021.

Catchings served as President of the WNBA Players Association from 2012 to 2016. She was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Early life and college career==
Catchings was born in New Jersey. She lived in Italy for one year while her father Harvey Catchings played professional basketball for Segafredo Gorizia, during which time she befriended Kobe Bryant. She played for both Adlai E. Stevenson High School and Duncanville High School, where she was named a WBCA All-American. Catchings participated in the WBCA High School All-America Game where she scored twelve points. She is also the first player at any level in history to be officially credited with scoring a quintuple-double (25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks).

Catchings was an All-American with the Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball for 1997–2001. She earned the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the AP Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women&#x27;s National Player of the Year award, and the WBCA Player of the Year award in 2000. As a freshman on the undefeated 1997–98 National champions, she was part of the &quot;Three Meeks&quot; with Semeka Randall and Chamique Holdsclaw.

==WNBA career==
Catchings was drafted 3rd overall by the Indiana Fever in 2001. Unable to play in the 2001 season due to an ACL injury sustained during her senior year at Tennessee, she had an outstanding year in 2002 and was named WNBA Rookie of the Year while averaging 18.6 ppg, immediately making an impact on the Fever roster in her first year as a pro. During her rookie season, in a regular season game against the Minnesota Lynx, Catchings had tied a then WNBA record, 9 steals (which has since been broken by Ticha Penicheiro). That year, the Fever made it to the playoffs and despite losing 2–1 in the first round, Catchings had a dominant series, averaging a playoff career-high 20.3 ppg.

Catchings&#x27;s best season of her career would be in the 2003 season, where she averaged a career-high 19.7 ppg although the Fever never made it to the playoffs that year.

In 2005, Catchings scored her 2,000th point in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. With this she became the fourth fastest player to score 2000 career points in the WNBA, reaching the milestone in only four seasons of play. She is also the fastest to 1,000 rebounds, 400 assists, and 300 steals. In 2005, Catchings was also named the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year. Catchings then repeated as Defensive Player of the Year in 2006. She was again named Defensive Player of the Year in 2009, 2010 and 2012.

In 2006, Catchings was voted into the 2006 WNBA All-Star Game, and was also the leading vote-getter, but had to sit out because of a foot injury. At half-time she was announced as a member of the All-Decade Team along with nine other players and former Comets coach Van Chancellor. Five years later she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA.

Months before the 2008 season, the Fever traded for hometown all-star shooting guard Katie Douglas (who would play with the team until 2013) to pair up with Catchings, forming an all-star duo to compete for a championship and strengthen their lineup. However, the Fever fell way short of championship contention in 2008 as they were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Shock during the playoffs.

In 2009, the Fever would have more postseason success, as the chemistry developed between Catchings and Douglas, the Fever would advance to the WNBA finals, making it Catchings&#x27;s first finals appearance. Prior to this, Catchings led the league in steals with 2.9 spg and helped lead the Fever to a 22–12 record, earning the top seed in the Eastern Conference. In the finals they faced the Phoenix Mercury and had a 2–1 series lead but would lose the next two games to be defeated in the finals 3–2.

In 2011, Catchings won WNBA Most Valuable Player while averaging 15.5 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 3.5 apg and 2.0 spg also leading the Fever to a 21–13 record, topping the Eastern Conference standings. However, in the playoffs she performed poorly offensively averaging a playoff career low 10.0 ppg. The Fever would end up making it to the Eastern Conference finals where they got eliminated 2–1 to the Atlanta Dream. In game 2 of the series, Catchings suffered a right foot injury. Although she was able to play in game 3, she had a sub-par performance following the injury, playing only 10 minutes and was 0 for 4 from the field.

In 2012, the Fever made a change in their starting line-up, with Douglas playing the small forward, Catchings at power forward and Shavonte Zellous at shooting guard during the regular season. The Fever finished second in the Eastern Conference with a 22–12 record. They made it back to finals that year, this time against the championship defending Minnesota Lynx, but they would defeat Minnesota 3–1 in the series becoming only the second Eastern Conference franchise to win a WNBA title, despite playing without Katie Douglas who suffered an ankle injury in the Conference finals. Catchings scored a game-high 25 points in the final game of the series and also won WNBA Finals MVP.

In 2014, Catchings missed the Fever&#x27;s first 17 games of the season with a sore back and returned 6 games prior to the 2014 WNBA All-Star Game in which she was selected to play in. During the all-star game, Catchings scored a game winning basket for the Eastern Conference all-star team to put them up 125–124 with 6 seconds left in overtime. Later on in the season, the Fever finished second in the East with a 16–18 record. On August 23, 2014, Catchings became the WNBA&#x27;s all-time leading playoff scorer after making a three-point field goal in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Washington Mystics surpassing Lisa Leslie&#x27;s 908 career playoff points. She finished the game with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 7 steals also surpassing Lisa Leslie for most WNBA career playoff rebounds (471). The Fever would then advance to the Conference Finals and were one win away from advancing to the 2014 WNBA Finals but lost 2–1 to the Chicago Sky.

In October 2014 in a TV interview, Catchings revealed that she will be retiring after the 2016 Summer Olympics. She said:

I will be retiring in 2016, Lord willing, if my body holds up. Although I plan to step away as a player that is not to say I&#x27;ll step away from the game, hopefully. I am so thankful and blessed to have had an opportunity to play the game I have loved for so long. God has truly blessed me with an amazing playing career, and now it&#x27;s time to start transitioning to what He has for me beyond the lines of the basketball floor.

In the 2015 season, Catchings was voted as a WNBA All-Star for the 10th time in her career while averaging 13.1 ppg, passing Tina Thompson for most all-star appearances. With a new all-star sidekick Marissa Coleman joining her in the frontcourt, the Fever finished third in the Eastern Conference with a 20–14 record and made it back to the finals for the first time in three years for a rematch with the Minnesota Lynx, this time with Minnesota winning the series 3–2.

In the 2016 season, Catchings caught her 3,308th rebound in a regular season game loss to the Minnesota Lynx becoming the WNBA all-time leader in regular season rebounds also passing Lisa Leslie. Prior to becoming the WNBA all-time leading rebounder, Catchings had also become only the second player in WNBA history to have 7,000 points and 3,000 rebounds in the month of May. Catchings&#x27;s final WNBA game was on September 21, 2016, in a first round playoff game loss to the Phoenix Mercury, due to the WNBA&#x27;s new playoff format that had just been in effect, where the first and second rounds contains only a single elimination game instead of the traditional best-of-3 series. Also teams get seeded based on overall league standings instead of conference standings with the top two seeded teams receiving double byes to the semifinals (the last round before the WNBA finals) as well as the third and fourth seeded teams receiving byes to the second round. Catchings scored 13 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 30 minutes of play.

As of her retirement, Catchings ranked 1st all-time in career playoff scoring, 1st all-time in career playoff rebounds, 2nd in all-time regular season rebounds, 2nd in all-time career regular season scoring, 1st in total career steals and 1st in career steals per game average. She also holds another WNBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances of 12 straight seasons. Catchings had also appeared in 3 WNBA finals. She was also listed in the WNBA Top 20@20, a list of the league&#x27;s best 20 players ever in celebration of the WNBA&#x27;s 20th season in 2016, and The W25, a similar list of 25 players announced during the league&#x27;s 25th season in 2021.

==USA Basketball==
Catchings was named to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s Junior National Team (now called the U18 team). The team participated in the third Junior World Championship, held in Chetumal, Mexico in late August and early September 1996. The USA team won their early games easily, but lost by four points to the team from Brazil, ending up with the silver medal for the event.

Catchings continued with the team when it was invited to the 1997 FIBA Junior World Championship (now called U19) held in Natal, Brazil. After beating Japan, the next game was against Australia, the defending champion. The USA team pulled out to a 13-point lead in the second half, but gave up the lead and lost the game 80–74. She had a double-double in the game with 17 points and ten rebounds. The USA rebounded with a close 92–88 victory over Cuba, helped by 23 points each from Maylana Martin and Lynn Pride. The USA then went on to beat previously unbeaten Russia. After winning the next two games, the USA faced Australia in the gold medal game. The USA team has a three-point lead late, but the Aussies hit a three-pointer with three seconds left in regulation to force overtime. Although the Aussies scored first, Catchings scored to tie the game, then the USA pulled into the lead and held on to win 78–74 to earn the gold, and the first medal for a USA team at a Junior World Championship. Catchings was the second leading scorer for the USA team with 13.2 points per game and the leading rebounder with 7.2 per game.

In 1998, Catchings was named to the team representing the US at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team won all five games, earning the gold medal for the competition. Catchings averaged 6.4 points per game over the five games.
Catchings played for the USA women&#x27;s basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, helping the team win the gold medal.

Catchings was invited to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team training camp in the fall of 2009. The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants.

Catchings was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Catchings averaged 8.8 points per game.

Catchings was named as one of the National team members to represent the USA Basketball team in the WNBA versus USA Basketball. This game replaces the normal WNBA All-Star game with WNBA All-Stars versus USA Basketball, as part of the preparation for the FIBA World Championship for Women to be held in the Czech Republic during September and October 2010.

Catchings was one of 21 finalists for the U.S. Women&#x27;s Olympic Basketball Team Roster. The 20 professional women&#x27;s basketball players, plus one collegiate player (Brittney Griner), were selected by the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the final roster which will represent the US at the 2012 Olympics in London. She was selected for the final roster, and was part of the US team that won the gold medal.

In the 2016 Summer Olympics, Catchings played for Team USA and earned her fourth Olympic gold medal as they beat Spain 101–72.

==Overseas career==
Catchings played her first year overseas during the WNBA offseason in 2003, she played in South Korea for Asan Woori Bank Wibee. In the 2005–06 off-season, Catchings played for Spartak Moscow in the Russian League. Catchings would once again play in South Korea for Chuncheon Woori Bank Hansae in the 2006 and 2007 off-seasons. In the 2008–09 off-season, Catchings played in Poland for Lotos VBW Clima Gdynia and would play two consecutive off-seasons in the Turkish League from 2009 to 2011 for Galatasaray. In Catchings&#x27;s first season with Galatasaray, she played with then Indiana Fever teammate, Katie Douglas.

==Life after basketball==
In January 2017, it was announced that Catchings will serve as a game analyst for Women&#x27;s Basketball Games on SEC Network.

In February 2017, Catchings purchased a tea shop, Tea&#x27;s Me Cafe from the previous owners on the near north side of Indianapolis that she had been frequenting while playing for the Indiana Fever. The store expanded to three locations and in-store sales by 2023.

In April 2017, Catchings was named Director of Player Programs and Franchise Development for Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment.

Catchings competed in the Baltimore qualifying round of Season 11 of &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;. The episode aired on NBC on July 1, 2019.

Catchings previously served as the Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager for the Indiana Fever from 2020 to 2022.

==Philanthropy and activism==
In 2004, Catchings founded the &quot;Catch the Stars Foundation&quot;, a charitable organization that provides basketball camps, fitness clinics, mentoring and literacy programs for underprivileged children to help them become successful in sports and academics.

Catchings advocates in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and gun violence. Before the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she and Carmelo Anthony, an NBA athlete, attended a town meeting in Los Angeles to discuss violence committed by and to police officers. She and her teammates decided to kneel during the playing of the National Anthem to protest infringements upon human rights.

At another game, she and her teammates, along with members of two other teams, were fined $500 per player and $5000 per team for wearing warm up shirts that read &quot;#BlackLivesMatter&quot; and &quot;#Dallas5&quot;, in reference to violence by and against police officers.

==Personal life==
Catchings is the daughter of former NBA player Harvey Catchings. Her sister Tauja also played basketball at Stevenson and the University of Illinois, was drafted by the WNBA and now plays in Sweden. Tamika&#x27;s cousin Bobby is a starting forward for Eastern Illinois University&#x27;s basketball team. Tamika majored in Sports Management at the University of Tennessee.

Catchings helped Stevenson High School to Illinois&#x27;s IHSA Div. AA State Championship in her Sophomore year in 1995 under head coach Frank Mattucci before moving to Texas. During her sophomore year at Stevenson she won Illinois Ms. Basketball (at the time she was the youngest player to have won the award). In addition to leading Duncanville High to the state basketball title in her senior season (she played only two years at Duncanville after moving from the Chicago area), she also led the volleyball team to its only state title as a junior.

Catchings is hearing impaired. While living in Abilene, Texas as a third grader, she lost her hearing aids by throwing them into a field while walking home from school; her parents, unwilling and financially unable to replace the hearing aids, told her to learn to live without them. Catchings did not resume using hearing aids until shortly before her first season at Tennessee, when head coach Pat Summitt encouraged her to do so. In 2000, she was honored with the Reynolds Society Achievement Award by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. On June 24, 2008, Catchings was awarded the Dawn Staley Community Leadership Award for her work in the Indianapolis community with her Catch the Stars foundation.

Catchings refereed a game of 3-on-3 basketball played by Barack Obama along with local students from Kokomo, Indiana at the Maple Crest Middle School on April 25, 2008. Fever teammate Alison Bales also played on Obama&#x27;s team.

In February 2016, Catchings married Parnell Smith, a former basketball player for the University at Buffalo. The couple first met in July 2014 through a mutual friend.

Catchings is also a Christian. She had opened up about her faith in an interview by saying &quot;God is definitely my Savior. He&#x27;s the one that walks beside me through my ups and downs and the one that keeps me focused on where I am going in life. He protects me. He provides for me. He guides me and he leads me&quot;. She became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.

<text>Isoschizomers are pairs of restriction enzymes specific to the same recognition sequence. For example, SphI (CGTAC/G) and BbuI (CGTAC/G) are isoschizomers of each other. The first enzyme discovered which recognizes a given sequence is known as the prototype; all subsequently identified enzymes that recognize that sequence are isoschizomers. Isoschizomers are isolated from different strains of bacteria and therefore may require different reaction conditions.

In some cases, only one out of a pair of isoschizomers can recognize both the methylated as well as unmethylated forms of restriction sites. In contrast, the other restriction enzyme can recognize only the unmethylated form of the restriction site.
This property of some isoschizomers allows identification of methylation state of the restriction site while isolating it from a bacterial strain.
For example, the restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI are isoschizomers, as they both recognize the sequence 5&#x27;-CCGG-3&#x27; when it is unmethylated. But when the second C of the sequence is methylated, only MspI can recognize it while HpaII cannot.

An enzyme that recognizes the same sequence but cuts it differently is a neoschizomer. Neoschizomers are a specific type (subset) of isoschizomer. For example, SmaI (CCC/GGG) and XmaI (C/CCGGG) are neoschizomers of each other. Similarly KpnI (GGTAC/C) and Acc65I (G/GTACC) are neoschizomers of each other. 
An enzyme that recognizes a slightly different sequence, but produces the same ends is an isocaudomer.

<text>Émile Boirac (26 August 1851 – 20 September 1917) was a French philosopher, parapsychologist, promoter of Esperanto and writer.

==Biography==

Boirac was born in Guelma, Algeria. He became president of the University of Grenoble in 1898, and in 1902 president of Dijon University. A notable advocate for the universal language, Esperanto, he presided over its 1st Universal Congress (Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France, 7 August to 12 August 1905) and directed the Academy of Esperanto.

He was one of the first to use the term &quot;déjà vu&quot;, where it appeared in a letter to the editor of Revue philosophique in 1876, and subsequently in Boirac&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Avenir des Sciences Psychiques&quot;, where he also proposed the term &quot;metagnomy&quot; (&quot;knowledge of things situated beyond those we can normally know&quot;) as a more precise description for what was, then, commonly known as clairvoyance.

He was one of a group that conducted experiments on the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino. He also investigated animal magnetism, and various hypnotic phenomena such as the induction of sleep, &quot;transposition of senses&quot;, &quot;magnetic rapport&quot;, &quot;exteriorisation of sensitiveness&quot;, &quot;exteriorisation of motor nerve force&quot; etc.

Boirac died in Dijon in 1917.

<doc id="1127946" wikidata="Q6724492" url="?curid=1127946" title="Mackinac Bridge Walk">
<text>The Mackinac Bridge Walk is an annual event held every Labor Day since 1958 in Michigan in which people may walk the length of the Mackinac Bridge. Walkers are traditionally led across by the governor of Michigan.
In an average year, 40,000 to 65,000 people participate in the five-mile walk. This is nearly the combined population of the three counties connected by the bridge.

The Labor Day bridge walk is the sole exception to the rule prohibiting pedestrians on the bridge.

==History==

The walk was started and took place in late June 1958 during the Bridge&#x27;s dedication ceremony, led by Governor G. Mennen Williams. That first year only 68 people walked across the bridge. The walk was changed to Labor Day in 1959, and until 1964, participants in the walk alternated north and south in consecutive years.

During the 2007 bridge walk, celebrating the bridge&#x27;s 50th anniversary, participation was estimated at 60,000 walkers. The record number of walkers is estimated at 85,000 in 1992 when President George H. W. Bush crossed the Mighty Mac.

Starting in 2017, all vehicular traffic on the bridge as well as shipping and boating below, is stopped during the duration of the event. The 2020 edition of the walk was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the bridge authority cited logistical hurdles and falling toll revenue as reasons for the cancellation.

<doc id="1127947" wikidata="Q2784925" url="?curid=1127947" title="Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalhami">
<text>Rahmah ibn Jabir ibn Adhbi al-Jalhami (; c. 1760–1826) was an Arab ruler in the Persian Gulf region and was described by his contemporary, the English traveler and author, James Silk Buckingham, as &quot;the most successful and the most generally tolerated pirate, perhaps, that ever infested any sea.&quot;

As a pirate, he had a reputation for being ruthless and fearless. He wore an eyepatch after losing an eye in battle, which makes him the earliest documented pirate to have worn an eyepatch. He was described by the British statesman Charles Belgrave as &quot;one of the most vivid characters the Persian Gulf has produced, a daring freebooter without fear or mercy&quot;.

He began life as a horse dealer, and used the money he had saved to buy his first ship and with ten companions began a career of piracy. He was so successful that he soon acquired a new craft, a 300-ton vessel, manned by 350 men. He would later have as many as 2,000 followers, many of them black slaves. At one point his flagship was the &quot;Al-Manowar&quot; (derived from English).

==Name==

His name, Rahmah ibn Jabir ibn Adhbi Al Jalhami, means Rahmah son of Jabir son of Adhbi of the Jalahimah. His name should be written &quot;Al Jalhami&quot; if transliterated from Arabic, as &quot;Al Jalahimah&quot; is the plural name for his tribe.

==Description==
Rahmah was described by James Silk Buckingham:
== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Rahmah ibn Jabir ibn Adhbi al-Jalhami was born in Grane (present-day Kuwait) around 1760. Rahmah&#x27;s father, Jabir bin Adhbi, led their tribe from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar around 1766. After his tribe migrated alongside the Al Khalifa, the two had a falling out after the Al Khalifa refused to share the economic gain made from trade ventures. Rahmah&#x27;s tribe nonetheless agreed to fight alongside the Al Khalifa in their battle against the Persians in Bahrain in 1783. After Bahrain was annexed by the Al Khalifa, Rahmah&#x27;s tribe, feeling dissatisfied with their share of the rewards, moved first to Bushehr and eventually to Khor Hassan in northwest Qatar. After a short time, Rahmah overtook his eldest brother Abdullah in a struggle for leadership of the tribe; consequently, the tribe adopted piracy as a livelihood.

His base in Khor Hassan, which would serve as his base of operation against the Al Khalifa, was surrounded by a protected bay which contributed to the area&#x27;s defensive capabilities. He resided in a fort with mud walls with only a few huts in the vicinity. As a result of no centralized authority existing in Qatar from the 18th to 19th centuries, Rahmah was able to establish dominion over much of the peninsula for a period after the Al Khalifa relocated to Bahrain.

=== Alliance with the Saudis ===
Rahmah&#x27;s alliances with regional powers tended to be on the basis of shared opposition to the Al Khalifa: he formed an alliance with the first Saudi dynasty when it conquered Bahrain, and he founded and relocated to the fort of Dammam in 1809. Though some of his exploits were deemed piratical by the British, J. G. Lorimer, a British historian, remarks on Rahmah&#x27;s scrupulously correct conduct and his compliance with the laws of warfare. He generally avoided encounters with British cruisers so that he would not incur their anger. In 1809, after the British expedition of the Pirate Coast, many Qasimi refugees fled to Khor Hassan. Rahmah, the leader of Khor Hassan, reached a compromise with the British in which he agreed not to harbour any fugitivites in return for sparing the town. The British also sent a warning to the Saudi amir to demand the prevention of Rahmah from launching any attacks on the British.

He influenced the Saudis to launch an invasion of Bahrain in 1809. This greatly strengthened his position in Qatar, making him the most powerful tribal leader in the peninsula. Within a short duration, Rahmah had captured eighteen Utub vessels. However, in 1811, the combined forces of Said bin Sultan, Sultan of the Omani Empire and the Al Khalifa successfully drove the Wahhabi from Qatar and Bahrain. Rahmah then transferred his headquarters from Khor Hassan to his fort in Dammam.

=== Alliance with the Omanis ===
In 1816, he allied himself with the rulers of Muscat in their failed invasion of Bahrain, and broke his alliance with the Saudis. The Saudis then destroyed the fort of Dammam in July 1816, and he took refuge in Bushehr, bringing around 500 families with him. Said bin Sultan proposed that he become a subject of Muscat and settle in Oman, but Rahmah refused. He moved back to Dammam in 1818.

=== Subsequent campaigns ===
He assisted the British forces in the Persian Gulf campaign of 1819 against the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah. The operation was carried out after repeated incidents of piracy against British-flagged vessels by the Al Qasimi.

In January 1820, he and his crew were in preparation to launch a naval invasion of Bahrain from Qatif&#x27;s port but aborted their plans after being warned by the British. The following month, he travelled to Shiraz with three vessels to offer his assistance to the prince of Shiraz in his planned expedition of Bahrain. His hostilities against Bahrain continued throughout 1821 and 1822; he and his crew went on to capture 7 Bahraini vessels and kill 20 men. He settled in Bushehr from November 1822 until February 1824, whereupon he returned to his residence in Dammam. He went to Muscat at the beginning of 1825 and assisted Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Shakhbout in his expedition against the Qasimi tribe of Ras Al Khaimah. Near the end of that year, he commenced a series of predatory attacks on Qatif as punishment for the non-payment of the protection tax owed to him. The British chose not to intervene in his actions provided his attacks were limited to the inhabitants of Qatif.

He soon reshifted his focus to the Al Khalifa and went to war with them at the beginning of 1826. After a great number of casualties on his side, he fled to Bushehr where he sought material and military assistance from the British political resident. Having failed to convince the British for aid, he set off to Dammam with a reinforcement of 35 Balochis from Bushehr and continued waging his war against the Al Khalifa.

=== Death ===
In October 1826, Rahmah launched a raid on a vessel owned by the Al Khalifa rulers of Bahrain. Upon discovering the stolen goods, his nephew, Sheikh Ahmed bin Salman Al Khalifa, decided to recover the items and intercept Rahmah at sea. To ensure he could reach his uncle swiftly, Sheikh Ahmed augmented his boat’s speed by borrowing the oars from the vessel of Isa bin Tarif, the chief of the Al Binali tribe.

As the confrontation neared, Rahmah, who was nearly blind due to cataracts, noticed an approaching boat and inquired about its captain. When informed it was his nephew, Sheikh Ahmed, he ridiculed him, remarking, &quot;The son of Maryoom sails?&quot;—a reference to Ahmed’s mother, Maryam, who was Rahmah’s sister. His astonishment stemmed from maritime tradition, where young men typically only commanded ships after marriage, as this signified their readiness for responsibility. Rahmah retorted, &quot;How can he set sail if he has not approached fair maidens?&quot;

Sheikh Ahmed and his crew boarded Rahmah’s ship, leading to a fierce sword fight. Realizing his death was imminent and learning that his loyal slave, Tarar, had been killed, Rahmah retreated to the inner galley of his ship with his eight-year-old son, Shaheen. There, he lit the gunpowder kegs with charcoal from his hookah causing the ship to explode, killing all of his men and the Al Khalifa men that were raiding his ship.

==Legacy==
Rahmah&#x27;s legacy lasted long after his death; in the 1960s Charles Belgrave wrote of how old men in the coffee shops throughout the region would still talk of his exploits.

<doc id="1127948" wikidata="Q1125160" url="?curid=1127948" title="Pityriasis rosea">
<text>Pityriasis rosea is a type of skin rash. Classically, it begins with a single red and slightly scaly area known as a &quot;herald patch&quot;. This is then followed, days to weeks later, by an eruption of many smaller scaly spots; pinkish with a red edge in people with light skin and greyish in darker skin. About 20% of cases show atypical deviations from this pattern. It usually lasts less than three months and goes away without treatment. Sometimes malaise or a fever may occur before the start of the rash or itchiness, but often there are few other symptoms.
While the cause is not entirely clear, it is believed to be related to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) or human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7). It does not appear to be contagious. Certain medications may result in a similar rash. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.
Evidence for specific treatment is limited. About 1.3% of people are affected at some point in time. It most often occurs in those between the ages of 10 and 35. The condition was described at least as early as 1798.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of this condition include:
* Recent upper respiratory tract infections in 8–69% of patients have been reported by some studies.
* Occasionally, prodromal flu-like symptoms, including headache, joint pain, mild fever, and fatigue, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting, and feeling generally unwell, precede other symptoms.
* In most cases, a single, 2 to 10 cm (1&quot; to 4&quot;) oval red &quot;herald&quot; patch appears, classically on the trunk or neck, having an appearance similar to ringworm. Occasionally, the herald patch may occur in a hidden position (in the armpit, for example) and not be noticed immediately. The herald patch may also appear as a cluster of smaller oval spots, and be mistaken for acne. Rarely, it does not become present at all.
* After the herald patch appears, usually some days or weeks later, a rash of many small (5–10 mm; &quot; to &quot;) pink or red, flaky, oval or round spots appear. They are mostly situated on the trunk and upper limbs. They follow the skin&#x27;s cleavage lines, which on the upper chest and back produce a characteristic &quot;christmas-tree&quot; distribution.
* In 6% of cases an &quot;inverse&quot; distribution may occur, with rash mostly on the extremities. In children, presentation can be atypical or inverse, and the course is typically milder.
* About one in four people with PR have mild to severe symptomatic itching. (Moderate itching due to skin over-dryness is much more common, especially if soap is used to cleanse the affected areas.) The itching is often non-specific, and worsens if scratched. This tends to fade as the rash develops and does not usually last through the entire course of the disease.

About a fifth of cases have an atypical form, with significant variations in symptoms including the size, distribution, morphology, and evolution of the lesions. In addition to typical papules and scales, forms appearing as very large plaques (pityriasis rosea gigantea), urticaria, large blisters, patches resembling erythema multiforme, oral lesions, and various other appearances have been noted. A vesicular form can mimic chicken pox. Variations in distribution include inverted forms, with rashes on the face or extremities without appearing on the trunk, as well as more uncommon versions localized to the armpits, groin, or extremities (pityriasis rosea circinata et marginata of Vidal) or unilateral spread.

==Causes==
The cause of pityriasis rosea is not certain, but its clinical presentation and immunologic reactions suggest a viral infection as a cause. Some believe it to be a reactivation of herpes viruses 6 and 7, which cause roseola in infants, though some investigations have found no evidence of this.

==Diagnosis==

Experienced practitioners may make the diagnosis clinically. Classical symptoms are usually straightforward to recognize, but the wide range of atypical forms may cause difficulty for the clinician in diagnosing some cases. Misdiagnosis by nondermatologists is not uncommon. If the diagnosis is in doubt, tests may be performed to rule out similar conditions such as Lyme disease, ringworm, guttate psoriasis, nummular or discoid eczema, drug eruptions, other viral exanthems. The clinical appearance of pityriasis rosea in some cases is similar to that of secondary syphilis, and rapid plasma reagin testing should be performed if there is any clinical concern for syphilis. A biopsy of the lesions will show extravasated erythrocytes within dermal papillae and dyskeratotic cells within the dermis.

A set of validated diagnostic criteria for pityriasis rosea is as follows:

A patient is diagnosed as having pityriasis rosea if:

# On at least one occasion or clinical encounter, the patient has all the essential clinical features and at least one of the optional clinical features, and
# On all occasions or clinical encounters related to the rash, the patient does not have any of the exclusional clinical features.

The essential clinical features are the following:
# Discrete circular or oval lesions,
# Scaling on most lesions, and
# Peripheral collarette scaling with central clearance on at least two lesions.

The optional clinical features are the following:
# Truncal and proximal limb distribution, with less than 10% of lesions distal to mid-upper-arm and mid-thigh,
# Orientation of most lesions along skin cleavage lines, and
# A herald patch (not necessarily the largest) appearing at least two days before eruption of other lesions, from history of the patient or from clinical observation.

The exclusional clinical features are the following:

# Multiple small vesicles at the centre of two or more lesions,
# Two or more lesions on palmar or plantar skin surfaces, and
# Clinical or serological evidence of secondary syphilis.

==Treatment==
The condition usually resolves on its own, and treatment is not required. Oral antihistamines or topical steroids may be used to decrease itching. Steroids do provide relief from itching, and improve the appearance of the rash, but they also cause the new skin that forms (after the rash subsides) to take longer to match the surrounding skin color. While no scarring has been found to be associated with the rash, scratching should be avoided. It&#x27;s possible that scratching can make itching worse and an itch-scratch cycle may develop with regular scratching (that is, you itch more because you scratch, so you scratch more because you itch, and so on). Irritants such as soaps with fragrances, chlorinated water, wool, and synthetic fabrics should be avoided. Lotions that help stop or prevent itching may be helpful.

Direct sunlight makes the lesions resolve more quickly. According to this principle, medical treatment with ultraviolet light has been used to hasten resolution, though studies disagree whether it decreases itching or not. UV therapy is most beneficial in the first week of the eruption.

A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most treatments. Oral erythromycin was found to be effective for treating the rash and relieving the itch based on one early trial; however, a later study could not confirm these results.

==Prognosis==
In most patients, the condition lasts only a matter of weeks; in some cases it can last longer (up to six months). The disease resolves completely without long-term effects. In a ten-year epidemiological study of 939 people in the United States, less than two percent had a recurrence.

==Epidemiology==

The overall prevalence of PR in the United States has been estimated to be 0.13% in men and 0.14% in women. It most commonly occurs between the ages of 10 and 35. It is more common in spring.

PR is not viewed as contagious, though there have been reports of small epidemics in fraternity houses and military bases, schools and gyms.

<text>CHCA-TV was a television station in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. It was owned by Canwest, and was part of the E! television system. The station was seen on VHF channel 6 and cable channel 11 in Red Deer. The station was previously Red Deer&#x27;s CBC affiliate. CHCA had its studios on Bremner Avenue in Downtown Red Deer (where CHUB and CFDV are currently based) and transmitter off Range Road 265 in Red Deer County.

Canwest announced in February 2009 that it was reviewing several options, including closure, for its E! stations due to financial pressures. The station closed on August 31, 2009.

== History ==
The station began broadcasting on December 11, 1957 as CHCA-TV, the &quot;CA&quot; standing for Central Alberta. The station&#x27;s founder was Fred Bartley. In September 1965, the call letters were changed to CKRD-TV, the RD standing for Red Deer.

In the period between 1969 and 1976, CKRD was owned by Henry Flock and Gordon Spackman who also owned two radio stations with the same moniker in Red Deer (CKRD and CKRD-FM). Past employees of that era included Danny Teed, Ron MacLean, Martin Smith and Al Coates. In 1976, Monarch Broadcasting purchased the station, and in 1989, was purchased by Allarcom (not to be confused with Allarco). Allarcom merged with WIC in 1991, before being purchased by Canwest in 2000.

In the days as CKRD, the station was known on air as &quot;RDTV&quot;. Its general slogan was &quot;&quot;The Heart of the West&quot;, and its news slogan was &quot;Our focus is YOU&quot;&quot;. CKRD broadcast a minimum of 40 hours of programming from the CBC, with the rest of the programming coming from WIC, and later Canwest&#x27;s CH system. Some of those who wanted a full CBC schedule could view Edmonton&#x27;s CBXT in the area, other areas lacked a real CBC station. From the mid-1980s onward, it was carried on cable in Edmonton and Calgary.

News bulletins were broadcast at 12 noon and 5 p.m., with a Saturday bulletin produced by CITV Edmonton aired at either 11pm, or after &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. The weekend newscast was moved to Sundays near the end of its association with CBC.

On September 5, 2005, the station disaffiliated from the CBC and became the fourth station in the CH television system. On that date, the station changed its call letters back to the original CHCA.

Sportscaster Ron MacLean began his career at CKRD.

Plans to build rebroadcasters in Edmonton and Calgary were initially denied in 2005 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). A new application to the same effect was approved on June 8, 2007. The Edmonton transmitter broadcast on Channel 17; the Calgary transmitter was on Channel 44. Rogers initially received approval in principle for the Calgary transmitter, but was required to submit a new application for an alternate channel number because of a conflict with Rogers Communications&#x27; contemporaneous application for new Omni Television outlets in both cities. The station was not allowed to solicit local advertising in Calgary or Edmonton (although it could theoretically &quot;accept&quot; if specifically approached by advertisers in those markets).

CHCA was relaunched on September 7, 2007 as E! Red Deer, as part of Canwest&#x27;s rebranding of CH stations to E!. Local programming was renamed CHCA News as a result of the rebranding.

On February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore &quot;strategic options&quot;, including possible sale, for CHCA and its other E! stations, saying &quot;a second conventional TV network is no longer key to the long-term success&quot; of the company.

On July 22, 2009, Canwest announced it would be closing CHCA as of August 31, 2009 at 5:00am MT, issuing layoff notices to staff. Its final entertainment program was a rerun of &quot;Wild On!&quot; at 12:30 a.m., followed by a four-hour block of informercials until 5:00 a.m., and then a &quot;goodbye&quot; slide that ran before a black screen that aired all day long until the transmitters were finally shut off.

The station was the first major TV station in Canada to have gone dark since 1977, when CFVO-TV in Hull, Quebec left the air (the channel would be reactivated five months later as Radio-Québec outlet CIVO-TV, on a new licence); all other defunct stations in Canada became repeaters of other stations almost seamlessly. Sportscaster Ron MacLean commented that the station&#x27;s closure was &quot;a sign of the times,&quot; but &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me somewhere down the road if it starts up again.&quot; CKX-TV, a CBC affiliate in Brandon, Manitoba would follow, closing approximately one month later on October 2, 2009. The neighbouring CTV Two Alberta stations CIAN-TV 13 Calgary and CJAL-TV 9 Edmonton were closed down on August 31, 2011 (going to cable-only status), followed two months later by CKXT-DT Toronto.

The CHCA-TV licence was revoked on December 16, 2009.

== News ==
The station aired local newscasts at 5 and 5:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday to Friday, and until September 2008 aired newscasts on the weekends. This change coincided with Global Edmonton remotely taking control of the station&#x27;s production. The news set surrounding the on-air talent was digitally created, similar to a weather anchor&#x27;s green screen set up.

===CBC era===
The translator in Coronation, formerly CKRD-TV-1 on channel 10, later moved to channel 13, broadcasting the Edmonton CBXT signal since the 2005 disaffiliation from CBC; this translator would go dark on July 31, 2012, due to financial measures imposed by the CBC. The station also had a translator on channel 10 in Banff, which has since gone dark.

== Digital television and high definition==
As of its closure on August 31, 2009, CHCA-DT never signed on the air.

CHCA-DT was allocated channel 28 for Red Deer, while its Edmonton and Calgary repeaters converted to digital as a flash-cut. Following the station&#x27;s closedown and licence revocation, the allocations for its analog and digital frequencies became open for future stations. Should a new television station open up in Red Deer in the future, it would not be required to operate as a digital station, as Red Deer is not a mandatory market for digital conversion, which took place in most other markets on August 31, 2011.

<doc id="1127973" wikidata="Q369898" url="?curid=1127973" title="Billy Gibbons">
<text>William Frederick Gibbons (born December 16, 1949) is an American rock musician, best known as the guitarist and primary vocalist of ZZ Top. He began his career in Moving Sidewalks, who recorded &quot;Flash&quot; (1969) and opened four dates for the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969 and released &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album&quot; in early 1971. He has also maintained a solo career in recent years, starting with his first album &quot;Perfectamundo&quot; (2015).

Gibbons has made appearances with other artists and acted on television shows, most notably in a recurring role as Angela&#x27;s rock star father on &quot;Bones&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the 32nd greatest guitarist of all time.

== Early life ==
Gibbons was born to Frederick Royal (&quot;Freddie&quot;) and Lorraine (née Duffy) Gibbons in the Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston, Texas. His father was an entertainer, orchestra conductor, and concert pianist who worked alongside his second cousin, art director Cedric Gibbons, for Samuel Goldwyn at MGM Studios. When Gibbons was five years old, his mother took him and his sister to see Elvis Presley. At age seven, Gibbons&#x27;s father took him to a B. B. King recording session. A percussionist at first, Gibbons was sent by his father to New York City to study with Tito Puente. In 1962, Gibbons received his first electric guitar following his 13th birthday, a sunburst Gibson Melody Maker, accompanied by a Fender Champ amplifier, and was influenced by guitarists such as Jimmy Reed.

While attending Warner Brothers&#x27; art school in Hollywood, California, Gibbons engaged with his first bands including the Saints, Billy G &amp; the Blueflames, and the Coachmen. By 18, Gibbons formed an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician, Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators, naming the group the Moving Sidewalks, penning the hit single &quot;99th Floor&quot;, and engaging in a friendship with Jimi Hendrix.

== Musical career ==

=== Moving Sidewalks ===

Gibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group the Moving Sidewalks, which recorded several singles and one full-length album, &quot;Flash&quot;. Gibbons and the Moving Sidewalks came to prominence opening for the Jimi Hendrix Experience during Hendrix&#x27;s first American tour as a headliner. Also notable was the Gibbons-penned song, &quot;99th Floor&quot;, its title a nod to the influence on Gibbons of fellow Texans and pioneering psychedelic band the 13th Floor Elevators. He has also commented during live performances while playing the string-bending intro to &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; that Hendrix taught him how to play when Gibbons was &quot;about 17&quot; in Dallas.

=== ZZ Top ===

Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969, and quickly settled on bassist/vocalist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank &quot;Rube&quot; Beard, both members of the band American Blues. After honing their trademark blues-rock style, they released &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album&quot; on London Records in 1971. Although all three members were born in 1949, Gibbons was the youngest member of the band.

=== Solo career ===
On July 31, 2015, it was announced that Gibbons&#x27; solo project will be named Billy Gibbons and the BFG&#x27;s featuring musicians Mike Flanigin, GG Maartine (&quot;née&quot; Martine GuiGui), Joe Hardy and Greg Morrow. Their debut album, &quot;Perfectamundo&quot;, was released on November 6, 2015.

Gibbons&#x27; second solo album, &quot;The Big Bad Blues&quot;, was released on September 21, 2018, via Concord Records. At the 40th Blues Music Awards in May 2019, the album was named as &#x27;Blues Rock Album of the Year&#x27;.

In a 2019 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Gibbons said that he was already starting to work on his next solo release: &quot;I think we&#x27;re going to call it &quot;Hardware&quot;, and that&#x27;s in tribute to Joe Hardy, our stalwart engineer for four decades. He recently passed on, but in his wake he left the instruction manual -- &#x27;Here&#x27;s how to do it.&#x27; We&#x27;re still trying to get to the back chapters. It goes deep.&quot; The album was released in 2021.

Gibbons has claimed this was one of his favorite collaborations and &quot;Precious and Grace&quot; was later added back into ZZ Top&#x27;s set lists. Gibbons was selected to guest the follow-up album &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot; but was unable due to scheduling conflicts.

In 2007, Gibbons was featured in the documentary feature film &quot;The 1959 Burst&quot; alongside Les Paul guitar legends like Slash, Rick Nielsen and Eric Johnson

== Other projects ==
=== Television ===
Gibbons had a recurring role on the Fox network TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, appearing in seven episodes over nine years. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, as the father of Michaela Conlin&#x27;s character, Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro. He is never referred to by name on the show, though; every mention is limited to &quot;Angela&#x27;s father&quot;. Conlin&#x27;s character&#x27;s middle name is the same as Gibbons&#x27; Les Paul guitar. Gibbons&#x27;s character is extremely protective of his daughter, and he often &quot;threatens&quot; or &quot;haunts&quot; Angela&#x27;s husband and colleague Dr. Jack Hodgins, telling him that if he hurts Angela, he will pay. When Angela and Hodgins first broke up, he drugged and kidnapped Hodgins, during which time he also gave him a tattoo of Angela&#x27;s face on his left deltoid area. After Angela discovers the tattoo, she informs Hodgins she wants it removed (he never removed it) and angrily exclaimed when she discovered it was her dad&#x27;s doing, &quot;I am so going to kick his Texan bad ass.&quot;

He has appeared in several other episodes of &quot;Bones&quot;, including one where he asks Hodgins to help him recover his car from some &quot;biker hoods&quot;. In his next appearance, he argued with Hodgins over baby names. He wanted the child to be named &quot;Staccato Mamba&quot;, which came to him in a song, while Angela and Hodgins wanted to name him &quot;Michael Vincent&quot;. (Parents and grandfather compromised on &quot;Michael Staccato&quot;.) At the end of the episode, Hodgins discovers he has yet another tattoo on his right biceps, this time of his father-in-law with the word &quot;Daddy&quot; across Gibbons&#x27; beard (at which point Gibbons told Hodgins that celebratory tequila and he do not seem to mix). In a later episode, he asks to babysit his grandson Michael, pointing out that Angela had spent many nights when she was a baby sleeping soundly backstage while he played to sold-out stadiums. After initial reluctance of Angela and Hodgins, they agree due to the need to get some sleep, as Michael will not stop crying and go to sleep. Gibbons solves the problem by discovering the music Michael likes, including blues and boogie rock, such as ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Hi Fi Mama&quot;.

Gibbons voiced a character in episode 60 of &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.

Gibbons, along with his ZZ Top bandmates Dusty Hill and Frank Beard, voiced a fictionalized version of himself in Fox&#x27;s animated show &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, which is set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. In the show, Dusty Hill is said to be a cousin of the show&#x27;s main character, Hank Hill.

Gibbons appeared as a dining room guest in the season 13 episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

=== Books ===
Gibbons co-wrote the book &quot;Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead&quot; with author Tom Vickers, first published in 2005. The book is divided into three sections: The Life, The Cars, and The Guitars. The first section is a biography of Gibbons, while the latter two sections showcase his car and guitar collections, respectively. In 2020, Motorbooks published an expanded reissue of the book to commemorate the 50th anniversary of ZZ Top.

=== BFG Brand sauces ===
In 2011, Gibbons joined with Texas-based Mojo Products, LLC, to launch a line of hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and other products with his own personal branding, &quot;BFG Brand&quot;. The sauces were sold as BFG No. 44 via his personal website.

In late 2012, Gibbons was featured in a series of television commercials for Fiesta Mart, a Texas supermarket chain. Some of the BFG Brand sauces were seen in these commercials.

=== Session work ===
In 2018, Billy Gibbons teamed up with John Fogerty. During the planning of Fogerty and ZZ Top&#x27;s coheadlining summer Blues and Bayous Tour, Fogerty wrote a song with Gibbons entitled &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; which Gibbons appeared on adding vocals and some guitar. Gibbons had this to say to &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not an overstatement to say that writing a song with John Fogerty is a genuine bonus. It&#x27;s fair to say that John and I are both pumped about our collaboration and we think this new one called &#x27;The Holy Grail&#x27; holds true with some great storytelling and some solid guitarist movin&#x27; the number right along. It begs a shout of, &#x27;Turn it up!&#x27;&quot; The single &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; was released on June 8, 2018.

== Equipment ==
=== Guitars ===

Gibbons primarily plays Gibson guitars. His first guitar was a sunburst 1962 Gibson Melody Maker. In 1968, Gibbons acquired a sunburst 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar from a farmer in Houston, Texas, for $250. The guitar was named Pearly Gates, a name taken from the dangerous-to-drive &quot;rolling-wreck&quot; automobile that he sold to buy the guitar. The guitar has become the foundation/benchmark of every ZZ Top album since the group formed in 1969.

Gibbons also plays Fender guitars. During his stint in the Moving Sidewalks, Gibbons used a white 1963 Fender Jazzmaster and Fender Esquire. He has also used an extremely rare &quot;Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird&quot; given to him by Bo Diddley. The use of this guitar (beginning with the 2003 ZZ Top album &quot;Mescalero&quot;) inspired a signature production model, the Gretsch Billy-Bo Jupiter Thunderbird. For &quot;Mescalero&quot;, Gibbons also relied heavily on Ulrich Teuffel&#x27;s futuristic Birdfish guitar, saying it was second only to Pearly Gates. According to Gibbons, &quot;It really shines on Mescalero because of that dirty, raunchy tone. I defy any other instrument, besides these odd-ball things, to get that crazy.&quot; Gibbons recorded &quot;Eliminator&quot; using a Dean ML guitar.

For the music video for the 1983 single &quot;Legs&quot;, Gibbons and Hill used matching spinning sheepskin fur guitars made by Dean Zelinsky of Dean Guitars. The guitars are attached to the belt buckles with a rotary electrical contact and strap mount, allowing them to spin. Gibbons credited the spinning idea to Moving Sidewalks bassist Don Summers.

Gibbons worked with Thomas Nilsen of Cream T Pickups to create the BFG Banger humbucker pickup. At the January 2010 NAMM Show, Dunlop Manufacturing and Gibbons unveiled a new line of guitar accessories, Rev. Willy&#x27;s. These include Gibbons inspired picks, strings, and slides.

=== Strings ===
Gibbons notably uses strings in an extra light gauge of .007-.009-.011-.020-.030-.038 on his guitars and has a signature set manufactured and sold by Dunlop known as &quot;Rev. Willy&#x27;s Mexican Lottery Brand&quot;. The company also manufactures other gauges of these strings.

Originally a user of heavy gauge strings in ZZ Top&#x27;s earliest days, Gibbons switched to light strings after playing a show with B. B. King. King asked to play Gibbons&#x27; guitar, which he gladly obliged. After playing it, King noticed the heavy strings, handed the guitar back to Gibbons and asked, &quot;Why you working so hard?&quot;. Gibbons had assumed that the classic blues sound came from playing heavy gauge strings, but King told him otherwise and advised him to put light gauge strings on his guitar instead.

=== Amplifiers ===
Gibbons has used a variety of Marshall products, including the JCM 900 Dual Reverb, Bluesbreaker, JTM45, Major, and Lead 12. Recently, his live touring rack consists of the JMP-1 Preamp, combined with power amps such as the Valvestate 120 or the 9200 model. Gibbons has a large collection of vintage Fender amplifiers (his first amp was a Fender Champ), and collects Fender Dual Professionals. Other Fenders he has used include a Fender Bassman and Fender Tweed Deluxe. Gibbons now uses Magnatone amplifiers.

== Personal life ==
On December 14, 2005, Gibbons married longtime girlfriend Gilligan Stillwater (born Ellen J. Oetjen).

Gibbons is an avid car collector and custom car enthusiast with an extensive collection that includes a 1948 Cadillac Series 62 (known as CadZZilla), a 1962 Chevrolet Impala (known as &quot;Slampala&quot;), a 1950 Ford Business Coupe, and a 1958 Ford Thunderbird. One of his earliest custom cars, a 1933 Ford Coupe (known as &quot;Eliminator&quot;), was featured in three of ZZ Top&#x27;s music videos and is also on the cover of their 1983 album, also titled &quot;Eliminator&quot;. Gibbons also published a book in 2011 about his love of cars and guitars titled &quot;Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead&quot;. The November 2014 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine featured an interview with Gibbons and fellow guitarist Jeff Beck about their mutual appreciation of &quot;cars, guitars, and everything in between&quot;.

For several years, Gibbons has appeared wearing a braided-cloth cap rather than his familiar Stetson hat. During a visit to Vienna, he met the chief of the Bamileke people from Cameroon, with whom he traded the hat for the cap.

<text>The Northern Territory Police Force is the police body that has legal jurisdiction over the Northern Territory of Australia. This police service has 1,607 police members (2021-22 financial year) made up of 83 senior sergeants, 228 sergeants, 912 constables, 220 auxiliaries, and 64 Aboriginal Community Police Officers. The rest of the positions are members of commissioned rank and inoperative positions (2021-22 financial year). It also has a civilian staff working across the NT Police, Fire and Emergency Services.

Police in the Northern Territory are part of a tri-service: the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services with the Commissioner of Police as the CEO of the tri-service.

==History==

The Northern Territory Police traces its roots back to the South Australian Mounted Police from 1870 when Inspector Paul Foelsche and six other police officers arrived in the Territory. A small rural constabulary (part-time force) had existed earlier but was disbanded. The Native Police Corps was formed in 1884. Their role was mostly as a security force to protect the early inhabitants of the Northern Territory than as a police force. The current NTP came into existence in 1911. In 1931, the two Territories Central and Northern became the Northern Territory of Australia and the authority of the Commissioner of Police was established in the Administrator of the Northern Territory, in Darwin.

In December 1869, the governor commissioned Paul Foelsche, a Corporal in the SA Mounted Police stationed at Strathalbyn, to be the first sub-inspector of police at Palmerston. He sailed for Darwin soon afterwards. The police uniform then worn in the Territory was the same as that worn in South Australia. It consisted of a short cut-away blue serge tunic with nine regulation buttons, silver twisted cord shoulder knots, black braid on the sleeves and silver chevrons for non-commissioned officers. The riding breeches were dark blue corkscrew serge with a white stripe.

The earliest firearms used were Snider–Enfield rifles and carbines firing a .577 calibre cartridge. Later, Martini–Henry rifles were used, and Webley revolvers were issued. Like their predecessors, the Rural Constabulary at Escape Cliffs, the first detachment of police at Palmerston had as their first responsibility the maintenance of law and order in the community.

The police were frequently engaged following the discovery of gold near Pine Creek in 1872. Stations were established at Adelaide River, Yam Creek, Pine Creek, Roper River and later at Daly River. The first police fatality occurred in 1872 when Mounted Constable Davis, a noted swimmer, disobeyed a local Standing Order and swam in the sea. He was killed by a crocodile. Darwin&#x27;s first police station was constructed of poles and plaster measuring by . The inspector lived nearby in three rooms. A small stone building with two cells was the accommodation for those in custody. These are now incorporated in the Administrator&#x27;s offices on the Esplanade.

In Central Australia the police were part of the South Australian Mounted Police. Mounted Constable Shirley was the first mounted trooper in charge at Alice Springs (first called Stuart). At one time there were two Commissioners of Police in the Northern Territory: one for the Territory of North Australia and one for the Territory of Central Australia. In 1931, the two Territories became the Northern Territory of Australia and the authority of the Commissioner of Police was vested in the Administrator of the Northern Territory, in Darwin.

On 1 July 1964, Clive William Graham, a police officer of long standing in the Territory, was appointed as Commissioner and the force as a whole was administered as part of the Public Service of the Northern Territory. In recent years, various cases have made national and international headlines: the end of the Petrov Affair occurred in Darwin; the 1968 month-long bush search for Larry-Boy who murdered his wife and seriously injured a stockman at Elsey Station; and the 1971 attempted hijack of a plane at Alice Springs airport in which a Territory police officer, who was badly wounded, displayed great heroism. Events connected with search and rescue operations at sea, in swamps and the desert have also made the news. Auxiliaries and Aboriginal Community Police Officers. The Joint Emergency Services Communications Centre in Darwin has instant contact with all stations, vehicles, aircraft and vessels and provides for the Police, Fire, Emergency Services and St John Ambulance Service.

=== Female officers ===

Females were accepted as officers prior or from 1960. In 1962, both male and female candidates had to be unmarried, male applicants aged 21 to 30 years of age, up to 35 years with previous police experience; yet female applicants had to be between 25 and 35 (unless previous police experience). By 1970, only female candidates had to be unmarried. Believed-to-be Australia&#x27;s first female police motorcyclist, in April 1980, Constable Kate Vanderlaan rode a Honda 750 cc police special around Darwin. She later rose to be a deputy commissioner of the force.

===Recent history===
In 1955, there were 80 police officers. As of June 2011, the number of sworn Police, Auxiliaries and Aboriginal Community Police Officers in the service was 1,381.

In 1989, the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services were joined to become a Tri-Service. The Commissioner of Police also becoming the Chief Executive Officer for the Fire and Rescue Service and the Emergency Services.

In July 2019, Commissioner Reece Kershaw was appointed Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, after being at the helm of NT Police for five years.

In 2012, the colour of the police uniform changed from khaki to blue following a ballot in 2011 in which nearly 60% of officers voted in favour of changing the colour to blue. The roll-out of the new blue uniform, with a new design including the word &quot;Police&quot; displayed on the back of the shirt, started in February 2012 and finished in July 2012.

In 2024, NT Police enforced a series of curfews in Alice Springs.

===Organisational structure===
* Commissioner: Michael Murphy
* Deputy Commissioner, People, Crime and Capability: Murray Smalpage
* Deputy Commissioner, Operations and Road Safety: &quot;Vacant&quot;
* Assistant Commissioner, People and Cultural Reform: Bruce Porter
* Assistant Commissioner, Crime, Intelligence and Capability: Michael White
* Assistant Commissioner, Greater Darwin, Road Safety and Support: Travis Wurst
* Assistant Commissioner, Regional and Remote Operations: Martin Dole

==Organisation==
The headquarters of the Northern Territory Police is located at NAB House on Smith Street, . The Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Services is administered from the Peter McAulay Centre in . The Northern Territory Police maintains 63 local police stations and 5 police shopfronts coordinated by their respective Local Area Commands.

A number of specialist units have been established, including the Territory Response Group, Accident Investigation Unit, Computer Crime Unit, Drug Intelligence Unit, Substance Abuse Intelligence Desk (SAID), Indigenous Development Unit, Highway Patrol Unit, Missing Persons Unit, Remote Area Traffic Patrol Unit and Air Support Unit.

===Air Wing===
The NT Police Air Wing was formed in 1979 with bases in Darwin and Alice Springs, operating two fixed wing aircraft. The area of operation covers , being some north to the south and east to the west. This around one sixth of the Australian landmass, but is very remote, having less than 200,000 residents (1% of the national population). The commonwealth government funded an extra two planes to be based in Darwin. The planes were later handed back due to lack of money.

===CitySafe===
The CitySafe and Licensing Patrol Unit was forged during New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations in 2008/2009. CitySafe was officially launched by the NT Chief Minister Paul Henderson on 25 February 2009. After this was deemed a success, NT police were looking at establishing a specialist licensing enforcement unit in 2010.

===Bottle Shop Security===
Police Auxiliaries now guard bottle shops in Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. They are called liquor inspectors.

==Firearms and equipment==
Officers now carry the Glock 22 or the Glock 27 .40-calibre pistol for plain clothes members. Other weapons used in the Northern Territory Police include the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle which is used by specialist groups and specifically trained members in rural areas. Officers also carry Remington model 870 pump action shotgun and Remington model 700 (.308) bolt-action rifle, which is gradually replacing the older BRNO model 601 bolt-action rifles in the same calibre. The NT Police introduced the Model X-26 Advanced TASER into operational service for General Duties members in February 2008, distributing 74 units. The X26 Taser has now been replaced with the Taser X-2. as a less-lethal force option available to each frontline patrol.

Restraints used are ADI Saf-Lok Mark-IV and V handcuffs and Flexi-cuffs. Mk-6 and Mk-9 First Defense oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray are also general issue.

==Vehicles==
The Northern Territory Police mostly use LAC response vehicles include Ford Falcon sedans, Holden VE Commodore and Toyota Hilux dual cab utes as caged vehicles (4x4 and 2WD) Turbo diesel. Specialist vehicles include the Toyota Land Cruiser 4WD.

Highway Patrol vehicles usually consist of a combination of marked and unmarked Holden VY SS Commodores and Ford Falcon XR6II. Other specialist sections and units use a variety of police vehicles including Isuzu trucks, and fixed wing Pilatus PC-12 aeroplanes.

The Northern Territory police recently acquired Kia stingers to add to their Road Policing Command fleet.

==Ranks==

Northern Territory Police currently use the following ranks.
==Officers killed on duty==
* 7 November 1883, Mounted Constable John Shirley, aged 27 years from dehydration while searching for men who had murdered a man at Lawson&#x27;s Creek.
* 1 August 1933, mounted constable Albert Stewart McColl was speared to death at Woodah Island in Arnhem Land.
* 17 August 1948, Constable Maxwell Gilbert, aged 27 years when the vehicle he was driving overturned just north of Wauchope. He was escorting a prisoner to Alice Springs.
* 9 June 1952, constable William Bryan Condon was shot twice after confronting a gunman.
* 16 June 1967, inspector Louis Hook died from extensive injuries from a rollover near Pine Creek.
* 9 June 1970, sergeant Colin Eckert was killed in a head-on collision in Katherine.

* 3 August 1999, Brevet sergeant Glen Huitson was killed in a gun battle with bushman Rodney Ansell on the Stuart Highway.

==Indigenous deaths associated with police contact==
* In 1882 Constable Augustus Lucanus and Corporal George Montagu led a punitive expedition where a number of Aboriginal people were shot dead.
* In September 1884, ex-Constable Augustus Lucanus led a punitive expedition which &quot;dispersed&quot; two large &quot;mobs&quot; of Aboriginal people.
* In 1886 Constable William Curtis led a punitive expedition that resulted in 52 Aboriginal people being shot dead and another 12 falling to their deaths.
* In 1928, the Coniston massacre took place. A number of police officers shot dead dozens of Aboriginal Australians in Coniston. Constable William George Murray, who led the massacre was acquitted. In 2018 the then Commissioner of NT Police Reece Kershaw, issued an apology for the agencies involved in the massacre.
* In 2009 Constables Corey Brown and Jason Mather dragged Aboriginal man Cedric Trigger along a watch-house floor after he had fallen out of the back of their police wagon onto concrete while handcuffed and left him face-down where he died of a subdural haemorrhage.
* In 2012 Constable Gareth Evans dragged Aboriginal man Kwementyaye Briscoe along a watch-house floor, threw him into a counter and left him face-down on a mattress with his neck twisted against a concrete block where he died.
* In 2019 Constable Zachary Brian Rolfe shot dead Kumanjayi Walker after the teenager stabbed Rolfe. Rolfe was later charged with murder with the prosecution arguing that only the first shot was justified and the second and third shots fired by Rolfe were excessive. Rolfe was acquitted of all charges by a jury that found Rolfe was acting in self-defence.

==Controversies==
On 17 August 1980, an infant Azaria Chamberlain and her family members were camping near Ayers Rock. It was alleged the girl was snatched away by a dingo, but for a number of reasons, the parents were extradited to the Northern Territory and their vehicle seized. The parents Michael and Lindy Chamberlain were criminally charged and convicted; later overturned in 1988. A review of the forensic science section, a royal commission, and several inquests were held into the police investigation and cause of Azaria&#x27;s death.

<text>Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog is a fantasy-adventure television series set in a fantasy version of ancient Ireland, created by Saban Entertainment. It was loosely based on actual Irish mythology. The name is derived from Tír na nÓg, one of the Otherworlds of Irish mythology. It was Saban&#x27;s first fantasy series to involve knights, dragons, and wizards. It aired on the Fox Kids Network from September 12, 1998 to May 7, 1999.

The resulting series was an attempt in doing an original non-Japanese special-effects series rather than adapting from actual Japanese tokusatsu.

On an unnamed island, queen Maeve of Temra seeks to conquer the peaceful kingdom of Kells and enlists the evil fairy Mider, who gives her the mystical Rune Stone allowing Maeve to use sorcery. Queen Maeve mostly uses the Rune Stone to create or summon monsters whom she sends to wreak havoc. When king Conchobar of Kells seeks a way to protect his kingdom, protagonist Rohan, a druid&#x27;s apprentice, goes in search of the prophesied hero &quot;Draganta&quot;, with his friend the reformed thief Angus.

Later joined by the foreign Prince Ivar, and Conchobar&#x27;s daughter, princess Deirdre, they are drawn into Tír Na nÓg, whose king Fin Varra puts the group through various tests to determine their worthiness. The heroes having passed these tests, King Fin Varra gives them certain weapons granting control of the Classical elements Fire, Air, Water and Earth. Thereafter the four overcome Mider&#x27;s &quot;Evil Sentinels&quot; (recurring villains in the series) to capture corresponding suits of armor, and oppose the various monsters created by Maeve, assisted by the winged fairy &quot;Aideen&quot;. Subsequently, Rohan gains a new partner in Pyre the dragon, who later identifies Rohan as Draganta. Later in the series, another Mystic Knight emerges, in the form of prince Garrett of Rheged, who joins the others after they free him from Maeve&#x27;s telepathic control.

With her powers nearly exhausted, queen Maeve summons the monster &quot;Lugad&quot;, who is more powerful than any previous creation and was trained and mutated by Maeve&#x27;s teacher Nemain. It was discovered that Lugad and Rohan are both Maeve&#x27;s abandoned sons. In the series finale, they co-operate with the other Mystic Knights to defeat Maeve, whom king Conchobar banishes to another island. As for Nemain, she has claimed the Silver Chalice that Ivar sought to reclaim as Mider enters an alliance with her.

==Characters==
===Mystic Knights===
* Rohan (portrayed by Lochlann Ó Mearáin) – An orphan raised by the druid Cathbad, Rohan is noble, courageous and steadfast. His weapon is the Sword of Kells, which can emit fire. He also has possession of the Dragon&#x27;s Breath Dagger, which he uses to summon Pyre, the Dragon of Dare. To win his red and gold Mystic Armor, he had to defeat the Ice Lord of Temra. To don his armor, he shouts &quot;Fire within me!&quot;. He is also identified as the mighty warrior Draganta, who is destined to bring peace to Kells for 100 lifetimes. Later in the series, Rohan obtains the ability to become more powerful by the war cry, &quot;Battle Fury!&quot; When he has his armor made powerful in the forge within the Mountains of Gloom, his Battle Fury armor is crimson and gold. Eventually it is also revealed that he is the son of Queen Maeve, with Lugad as his half-brother.
* Deirdre (portrayed by Lisa Dwan) – The princess of Kells. Her weapon is the Whirlwind Crossbow, which shoots a burst of air. To win her white and gold Mystic Armor, she had to defeat the Lightning Bat of Temra. To don her armor, she speaks the words &quot;Air above me!&quot;. Deirdre is the most logical-minded of the Mystic Knights, and is therefore sometimes frustrated by her companions&#x27; foibles.
* Ivar (portrayed by Justin Pierre) – A prince from a distant land, Ivar came to Kells in search of his country&#x27;s sacred chalice. It was later revealed the chalice was stolen by Torc, Maeve&#x27;s general. His weapon is the Barbed Trident which shoots blue bolts of electricity. To obtain his blue and gold Armor, he had to defeat the Sea Serpent of Temra. To don his armor, he speaks the words &quot;Water around me!&quot; Ivar is loyal to his friends but can be distracted by his search for the stolen chalice, often to his own detriment. He later gains the Defender vehicle (which was meant to be used for Lugad) from Torc.
* Angus – (portrayed by Vincent Walsh) - Angus is Rohan&#x27;s best friend and a well-known, boastful reformed thief who often gets into trouble. His weapon is the Terra Sling Mace which throws giant boulders and can cause earthquakes. To obtain his silver and gold Mystic Armor, he had to defeat the Rock Wolf of Temra. To don his armor, he speaks the words &quot;Earth beneath me!&quot;.
* Garrett (portrayed by Ben Palmer) – Garrett is the prince of Rheged, an ally of Kells. Garrett and Deirdre were promised in marriage and therefore, Garrett first came to Kells to claim his bride. Prior to joining the other knights, he was magically controlled by Maeve, leading him to act against the knights in wicked fashion. However, they eventually freed him with a magic potion and he joined the team. Garrett has a unique ability to command any animal by locking eyes with it, which seems to be independent of his status as a Mystic Knight. His weapons are the Twin Timber Axes which shoot a beam of energy. To obtain his brown and gold Mystic Armor, he had to defeat a giant spider that dwelled in the Banshee Woods. To don his armor, he speaks the words &quot;Forest before me!&quot;. In exchange for returning princess Lynette to her homeland, Garrett was given the Dragon Bow Vehicle and he returned with it when the Mystic Knights were facing Lugad. Garrett serves the same role as a &quot;Sixth Ranger&quot; does in many &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series, supplementing the original team for a time before departing and returning at the climax of their adventures. His storyline is similar to that of Tommy Oliver.

===Allies===
* King Conchobar (portrayed by Stephen Brennan) – Conchobar is the king of Kells and the father of Deirdre. With Maeve using dark magic to try to help her win the war between their kingdoms, he is in desperate need of the Mystic Knights&#x27; help.
* Cathbad (portrayed by Barry Cassin) – A druid and advisor to King Conchobar. He also raised Rohan when he was an orphan. A father figure who did his best to raise Rohan as an apprentice. Cathbad is opposed to Rohan&#x27;s hanging around with Angus because he tends to cause trouble. He can foresee the future and mentors the Mystic Knights. Cathbad&#x27;s powers can rival Maeve&#x27;s, but are limited largely to extra-sensory perception. In &quot;Battle of the Druids&quot;, it was revealed that his teacher was Seethchenn who had recently allied with Maeve. Cathbad managed to vanquish his teacher in a druid battle.
* King Fin Varra (portrayed by Peadar Lamb) – The King of Tir Na Nóg. A fairy with great power who gives the Mystic Knights their weapons, as well as occasional advice. He is the rival of the dark fairy Mider.
* Aideen (portrayed by Kelly Campbell) – A sprite who assists the Mystic Knights. She has affection for Rohan and is consequently jealous of Deirdre.
* Princess Lynette (portrayed by Aisling Flitton) - The princess of a faraway kingdom. She became shipwrecked due to an attack by a beast called the Grindon which had been pursuing her for quite some time. Grindon came to the island of Kells in search for her and attacked the kingdom&#x27;s warriors and the Mystic Knights but fled after a lengthy battle. It later attacked the castle, but was repelled by the Mystic Knights. Lynette warned them that it would return at sunset before attempting to leave the castle for their safety, but the Mystic Knights convinced her to stay while devising a plan to lure the Grindon out into the opening. Finally Princess Lynette and Rohan use his sword and slay the Grindon, which she alone could do which as it turned out to be the reason was why Grindon had been pursuing her. After the monster&#x27;s final defeat, Garrett became her personal escort; with implications of feelings blossoming between them.
* Pyre: Dragon of Dare – An ancient dragon associated with the Mystic Knight of Fire. At first unwilling to tolerate any human presence, he soon comes to admire Rohan and later recognizes the Knight as Draganta, the legendary hero. Fiercely the rival of Tyrune the Hydra. Pyre wears a gem-studded cuirass, through which he presumably makes contact with the Dragon&#x27;s Breath Dagger wielded by Rohan. His likeness is worked into the Mystic Knights&#x27; armor. To summon Pyre, Rohan would hold out the Dragon&#x27;s Breath Dagger and quote &quot;Pyre: Dragon of Dare, I summon you&quot;.

===Villains===
* Queen Maeve (portrayed by Charlotte Bradley) – Maeve is the queen of Temra. She believes that being the ruler of Kells is her birthright, so she recruits the help of the dark fairy Mider. She is later revealed as the mother of both Rohan and Lugad. In the final battle, she takes over Kells until Lugad frees the captive Knights during her fight with Rohan. She uses her magic to assume the form of a naga-like creature with eye beams. Upon being defeated and regressing back to her human form by the combined powers of Rohan and Lugad, Maeve is banished to another island by King Conchobar. As she sees her son for the last time, Rohan himself asks if Maeve has anything to say to him before she is banished. She then replies that he&#x27;s been trained well and that he&#x27;s a great warrior except that he&#x27;s just on the wrong side. Rohan asks her to be taken away.
* Torc (portrayed by Gerry O&#x27;Brien) – Maeve&#x27;s general who was a former general in Kells before he betrayed them. He stole a silver chalice from Ivar&#x27;s kingdom, which Maeve needed to enable Mider to travel back and forth between Temra and his realm of dark magic. During the time Lugad was with Maeve, Torc used the Defender vehicle that was meant for Lugad only to lose it to Ivar. In the final battle, he learns that Maeve has been defeated and flees with his army as the Knights have defeated her. As it was mentioned that Torc and his men were last seen fleeing to the woods, Cathbad states that the Temrans are no longer a threat.
* Mider (portrayed by Ned Dennehy) – A dark fairy who helps Maeve with dark magic. He uses the silver chalice from Ivar&#x27;s kingdom to transport back and forth between a dark realm to increase his powers. After Maeve&#x27;s defeat and banishment, he aligned himself with the sorceress Nemain.
* The Four Sentinels of Temra – These are the four beings that the Knights had to fight in order to gain their Mystic Armor. They later fell under the control of Maeve, having formerly served their creator Mider.
** The Ice Lord of Temra (portrayed by Shaun Elebert) – A skull-headed ice lord and Queen Maeve&#x27;s main general. He fights with a curved ice sword. Rohan fought him in order to gain his Mystic Armor.
** The Lightning Bat of Temra (portrayed by Ned Dennehy) – A bat-headed member of the Four Sentinels. Deirdre fought him in order to gain her Mystic Armor. He wields a bat-shaped boomerang.
** The Sea Serpent of Temra (portrayed by Enda Kilroy) – A sea serpent-headed member of the Four Sentinels. He uses a weapon called the Serpent-Tongued Whip. Ivar fought him in order to gain his Mystic Armor.
** The Rock Wolf of Temra (portrayed by Ned Dennehy) – A wolf-headed member of the Four Sentinels. Angus fought him in order to gain his armor. He wields a set of claws on his forearm and a sword.
* Bogies – Little people who work as spies for Queen Maeve.
* Tyrune – Tyrune is the three-headed hydra of Temra. Maeve tricked Rohan into saying a druid incantation that released Tyrune from his imprisonment. This giant flying creature sometimes attacks without any warning. Often fights Pyre as they are rival dragons. Tyrune&#x27;s heads can separate from its body and can attack independently.
* Lugad (portrayed by Eric O&#x27;Cuinn) – Lugad was brought in near the end of the season. He is half-human, half-demon creature and raised primarily by the sorceress Nemain who was responsible for his mutation. Lugad is the son of Maeve and the half-brother of Rohan. He eventually turns against Maeve to help Rohan defeat her and leaves Kells. Before Lugad leaves, king Conchobar tells Lugad that he is always welcomed in Kells.
* Nemain – The former ruler of Temra until her student Maeve took it over by force. Since that day, she dwelt in a ruined castle and was seemingly content to raise and mutate Lugad on Maeve&#x27;s behalf. When Maeve retrieved Lugad, Nemain now and then aided the Mystic Knights in the disguise of an old man. When Maeve is defeated, Nemain reveals herself and claims the Silver Chalice declaring her revenge on Maeve complete. Shortly thereafter, Mider proposes an alliance with Nemain to take over Tir Na Nog and Kells. Nemain tells him that she will think about it.

===Monsters===
These are the monsters that the Mystic Knights battle:

* Ogre (1 and 2) – This was the first monster Queen Maeve summoned in her war against Kells. It can shoot fireballs from its mouth. Maeve used it to attack Kells. It was too much for the army of Kells until Rohan and the others arrived. Following the Temran army&#x27;s retreat, Maeve sent the Ogre into battle. With a combination of their weapons, Rohan and the others destroyed the Ogre.
* Juggernaut (3) – While Rohan was fighting the Ice Lord of Temra, Queen Maeve created an invincible Juggernaut from a living rock to attack the others. It can shoot boulders from its mouth. Once Rohan had obtained his armor, he helped to destroy it.
* Tash Hound of Temra (4) – When Rohan fell into Maeve&#x27;s trap, he ended up fighting the Tash Hound of Temra. It was a two-headed dog (similar to Orthrus of Greek Mythology) that can disappear into the shadows. Once Deirdre had obtained her armor, she helped Rohan defeat the Tash Hound of Temra.
* Cyclops (5) – A one-eyed monster with Ipotane-like legs and a lizard-like tail. Maeve sent it to attack a village. Very stupid, but nearly invulnerable. Once Ivar got his armor, the Knights defeated this monster.
* Bull of Temra (6) – After Angus was rescued, Maeve summoned this minotaur-like monster to fight the knights. It has two sets of horns: one set was composed of small stubby horns, and the other ram-like horns. It can shoot electrical-like beams from its small horns. Once Angus got his armor, the monster was defeated.
* Unnamed Creature #1 (15) – Cathbad&#x27;s teacher Seethchenn predicted that a monster will cross Darkness Loch and attack Kells. At the same time, Maeve summoned this lizard-faced monster with dragon wings, four tendrils for arms and a snake tail for legs to attack Kells. The Mystic Knights fought this monster at Darkness Loch and repelled it.
* Water Creature (20) – A Plesiosaurus/Water Dragon-resembling creature with a long tongue that dwells in the waters in Valley Long. Queen Maeve had it attack Rohan, Ivar, and Angus. It ended up swallowing Ivar. Rohan and Angus tried to get the monster to swallow up Ivar&#x27;s trident. With Deirdre&#x27;s help, Ivar got his trident and used his trident to get the Water Creature to spit it out before the Water Creature was destroyed by the Mystic Knights.
* Unnamed Flying Creature (21) – A fire-shooting stork/pteranodon creature with ram-like horns. Queen Maeve summoned it to target Prince Garrett. It ran afoul of Rohan and Angus in the first encounter. By the next encounter, Garrett used his special ability to command the creature to return to where it came from and to never to come to Kells again.
* Giant Spider (24) – Garret had to face the Giant Spider in Banshee Woods in order to get his Mystic Knight armor.
* Spectres of the Banshee Woods (24) – When Garrett was told by King Fin Varra that his test to obtain his Mystic Knight armor, Midar summoned 4 of these evil spectres to attack the Mystic Knights. The spectres ranged from an ant spectre, a porcupine/stingray spectre, a trilobite spectre, and a bat spectre. Garrett sought out his armor while the Mystic Knights fought these spectres. Once Garrett obtained his armor, he defeated these spectres.
* Giant Falcon (25) – Mider gave Maeve and Torc a falcon that will retrieve a map leading to a special dragon egg that Angus recently hid. Upon Rohan and Angus encountering Maeve and her army, she used the Runestone to turn it into a monster. Rohan and Angus don their armors and fight it. Aideen alerts the other knights and Deirdre and Ivar join the battle and repel the Giant Falcon.
* Wyvern (27) – A legless Wyvern who can shoot energy beams from its tail. At first, the Mystic Knights thought the invading Northmen that captured King Conchobar had control of it. It was actually Mider who had the Wyvern summoned on Maeve&#x27;s behalf to set up the Northmen in a threat to invade the entire island. Rohan, Angus and Garrett engage the Wyvern. As Garrett heads off to rescue King Conchobar from Maeve, Rohan and Angus&#x27;s attacks weren&#x27;t even having effect on the Wyvern. It was defeated by Pyre.
* Fire Creature (29) – When Angus was on trial for crimes he did not commit, Mider had Maeve summon a fiery creature to attack Kells. Rohan and Deirdre engaged the Fire Creature. When Ivar catches the real thief hired by Maeve and Angus is declared innocent, they joined the fight against the Fire Creature. With help from Pyre, the Mystic Knights vanquish the Fire Creature.
* Spiked Warrior (32) – After Maeve reclaimed the Silver Chalice from Kells, she summoned this unnamed trident-wielding spikey warrior to attack the Mystic Knights. Rohan, Deirdre, and Angus don their armor and were no match for it. When Ivar fired his trident attack on the Silver Chalice, it shot out energy that destroyed the monster.
* Phantom Boar (33) – Mider unleashed this ghostly boar to attack King Conchobar and Lady Fionna (who was Queen Maeve in disguise). King Conchobar defeated it easily with one hit from his sword.
* Worm of Woe (34) – To ensure that King Conchobar and King Fin Varra don&#x27;t fulfill a prophecy where they have to sit on each other&#x27;s thrones for a day, Queen Maeve unleashes the Worm of Woe upon Tir Na Nóg. It managed to disarm Rohan and Ivar of their weapons and corner them. Aideen arrives to distract it while Rohan and Ivar grab their weapons and armor up. Rohan and Ivar combined their attacks to destroy the Worm of Woe.
* Chimera (38) – When Prince Gann got hold of Maeve&#x27;s scepter, he used its magic to summon this flying three-headed composite monster with fiery breath. Maeve had Torc evade it to get her scepter. With the scepter recovered, Maeve took control of it and sent it after Gann. The Mystic Knights encountered it attacking Gann. While Rohan went to rescue him, the others armored up and fought the monster. After Rohan reclaimed his sword and repelled Torc, he helped the others to defeat the monster.
* Grindon (39) – This flying, barb-breathing monster is a scourge in Princess Lynette&#x27;s homeland. It has been pursuing Princess Lynette for quite some time since she wanted Grindon destroyed. Grindon came to the island and attacked the Kells soldiers and the Mystic Knights after it attacked some Temran villages. Upon armoring up, the Mystic Knights&#x27; weapons couldn&#x27;t affect it and it even prevented Rohan from calling Pyre. Torc arrived with his soldiers as Tyrune engaged it in battle. The Mystic Knights used their attacks on Grindon causing it to flee into Kells. It later attacked the castle and was repelled by the Mystic Knights. Lynette warned them that it will return at sunset and if it gets in, the castle will fall. After Princess Lynette left the castle, the Mystic Knights went after her and devised a plan to lure Grindon out into the opening. Finally learning the riddle given to them by King Fin Varra, Rohan has Princess Lynette use his sword and destroy Grindon, which she alone could do (which was why Grindon was pursuing her).
* Evil Eye (40) – Following Rohan being subjected to a potion that fills him with doubt, Queen Maeve summons this laser-shooting, tentacled eye to assist in the attack on Kells. Dierdre and Ivar encountered the Evil Eye and armored up to fight back. Once Rohan regains his confidence, he and Angus help Dierdre and Ivar vanquish the Evil Eye.
* Giant Panther (43) – A large saber-tooth black panther who assisted the Temran army in its fight against the Kells army. It was easily defeated by the Mystic Knights.
* Griffin (43) – To test Lugad to see if he&#x27;s ready, Queen Maeve summoned three griffins to do battle with him. Lugad manages to defeat them in combat.
* Shadow Monster (48) – Queen Maeve summoned this shadowy monster to assume the form of Lugad in her attack on Kells. Dierdre, Rohan, and Garrett managed to see through its disguise and armored up. They drove the Shadow Monster out of Kells as Angus and Ivar show up. They combined their attacks and destroyed the Shadow Monster.

<text>Teresa Gaye Weatherspoon (born December 8, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for Vinyl BC of the Unrivaled basketball league. She was previously the head coach of the Chicago Sky of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). She played for the New York Liberty and Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA and served as the head basketball coach of the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters. Weatherspoon was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. In 2016, Weatherspoon was chosen to the WNBA Top 20@20, a list of the league&#x27;s best 20 players ever in celebration of the WNBA&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

==Professional career==
Born in Pineland, Texas, Weatherspoon was a health and physical education major and star basketball player at Louisiana Tech. In 1988, her senior season, she led the Lady Techsters to the NCAA national title. After college, Weatherspoon played overseas in Italy, France and Russia for 8 years.

===WNBA===
Weatherspoon is one of the original players of the WNBA in 1997 when she joined the New York Liberty in the WNBA&#x27;s inaugural season. Her debut game was played on June 21, 1997, in a 67–57 win over the Los Angeles Sparks. In her first game, Weatherspoon recorded 3 points, 7 rebounds and 10 assists (the first player in WNBA history to record double-digit assists in a game). A talented ball-handler and charismatic leader, her energetic play quickly endeared her to the fans and media in New York. The Liberty reached the first WNBA finals, but fell short to the Houston Comets. Weatherspoon was the first winner of the league&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year Award.

The Liberty finished the 1998 season 18 - 12 behind Weatherspoon&#x27;s averages of 6.8 points, 4 rebounds and 6.4 assists. However, the team missed the playoffs. Weatherspoon would win the Defensive Player of the Year Award again in 1998 becoming the first back to back recipient of the award.

Having a similar productive season with the Liberty in 1999 (in addition to being selected as a 1999 All-Star), Weatherspoon and the team were able to make it back to the Finals with an 18 - 14 record. During the 1999 WNBA Finals, Weatherspoon had one of the most memorable feats in WNBA history; in Game 2 on September 4, 1999, the Liberty were down 67–65 against the Houston Comets with no timeouts left and 2.4 seconds left on the game clock after a shot made by Tina Thompson. After receiving the inbound pass, Weatherspoon dribbled the ball up to half court and made a game-winning shot 50 feet away from the basket to force a Game 3. That moment would later be referred to as &quot;The Shot&quot;.

From 2000 to 2003, Weatherspoon would make the All-Star Team every year and have the same productivity throughout the years with no drastic dip in her scoring or rebounding abilities, showing her reliance and toughness to the organization. The Liberty would make the Finals in 2000 and 2002 (making it 4 final appearances for Weatherspoon and the team) but lost the Finals both times. Being swept by the Comets in 2000 and being swept by the Sparks in 2002.

The 2003 season would be the first time the Liberty had a losing record, as they finished the season 16 - 18 and missed the playoffs for only the 2nd time in 6 years. Weatherspoon also had the distinction of being the only WNBA player to start every one of her games until the 2004 season. From 1997 to 2003, she played in 220 games and started in every one of them.

Weatherspoon would finally say goodbye to her time with the Liberty, as for the 2004 season, she would not re-sign with the team and instead signed with the Sparks on February 4, 2004. Her time with the Sparks saw a strong change in Weatherspoon&#x27;s role on a team, as she would finally come off the bench for the first time in her career and play an average of only 8.6 minutes per game (after averaging 31.1 on the Liberty). The Sparks finished 25 - 9 but would not make the Finals, as they were eliminated in the first round of the 2004 playoffs.

Weatherspoon&#x27;s final WNBA game ever was Game 2 of the 2004 Western Conference First Round on September 26, 2004, against the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks won the game 71 – 57 and evened the series 1 – 1 with Weatherspoon recording 2 rebounds in 3 minutes. However, Weatherspoon did not play in Game 3 and the Sparks lost that game 58 – 73 and were eliminated from the playoffs. After her 2004 season with the Sparks, Weatherspoon retired.

April 2, 2009 saw Louisiana Tech shed the interim label and name Teresa head women&#x27;s basketball coach. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA. In 2016, Weatherspoon was named in the WNBA Top 20@20.

=== New Orleans Pelicans (2019–2023) ===
On September 26, 2019, Weatherspoon was named two-way player development coach for the New Orleans Pelicans. Weatherspoon was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach for the Pelicans on November 16, 2020. The Pelicans released Weatherspoon from the coaching staff in June 2023.

On October 12, 2023, Weatherspoon was hired to be the Head Coach of the Chicago Sky of the WNBA.

Sky player Angel Reese posted on social media that she was &quot;heartbroken&quot; at the news, saying that Weatherspoon &quot;was the only person that believed in me. The one that trusted me,&quot; and calling her an &quot;unsung hero&quot; in Reese&#x27;s life.

==National team career==
Weatherspoon was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State&#x27;s Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72–53 of Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91–70. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer, ending in a 78–70 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67–58. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152–2 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84–82 win over the US in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21–19 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83–60 in favor of the US, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. For the entire event, Teresa Gaye Weatherspoon averaged 1.6 points per game.

Weatherspoon continued with the National team at the 1986 World Championship, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow, although she was injured and unable to play. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82–59 victory. At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6–0 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45–23 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15–1 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108–88.

Weatherspoon was selected to be a member of the team representing the US at the 1987 World University Games held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The USA team won four of the five contests. After winning their first two games against Poland and Finland, the USA faced the host team Yugoslavia. The game went to overtime, but Yugoslavia prevailed, 93–89. The USA faced China in the next game. They won 84–83, but they needed to win by at least five points to remain in medal contention. They won the final game against Canada to secure fifth place. Weatherspoon averaged 8.6 points per games. She recorded 21 steals over the course of the event, tied for first place on the team.

<doc id="1128004" wikidata="Q4157133" url="?curid=1128004" title="Donald Marshall Jr.">
<text>Donald Marshall Jr. (13 September 1953 – 6 August 2009) was a Mi&#x27;kmaq man who was wrongly convicted of murder. The case inspired a number of questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was Aboriginal; as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation put it, &quot;The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with &#x27;wrongful conviction&#x27; and the fight for native justice in Canada.&quot; The case inspired the Michael Harris book, &quot;Justice Denied: The Law Versus Donald Marshall&quot; and the subsequent film &quot;Justice Denied&quot;. His father, Donald Marshall Sr., was grand chief of the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation at the time.

==Early life==
Marshall was born on 13 September 1953 on the Membertou First Nation in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He was the oldest of 13 children of Donald Marshall Sr., the Grand Chief of the Mi&#x27;kmaq, and his wife Caroline Googoo.

==Wrongful conviction==
Marshall was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971. Marshall and Seale, both 17 years old, a Mi&#x27;kmaq and a boy of African descent, respectively, had been walking around Wentworth Park in Sydney, Nova Scotia during the late evening with the intent to &quot;roll a drunk&quot; as stated in his trial. They confronted and panhandled Roy Ebsary and Jimmy MacNeil, two older men they encountered in the park. A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell, mortally wounded by a knife blow from Ebsary. Ebsary never admitted that he had stabbed Seale and then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was &#x27;known to them&#x27; from previous incidents. Police speculated that Marshall, in a rage, had murdered Seale.

Marshall spent 11 years in prison before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. In this appeal, which acquitted him of the previous murder charge, Marshall was assumed to have lied in his first trial about his and Seale&#x27;s activities on the night of Seale&#x27;s death. The accusation was that he and Seale had actually approached Ebsary with the intention of robbing him when they were in the park that night. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter. When Marshall&#x27;s conviction was overturned, the presiding judge placed some blame on Marshall for the miscarriage of justice, calling him &quot;the author of his own misfortune.&quot; This was viewed as a &quot;serious and fundamental error&quot; by the Royal Commission report. Anne Derrick, Q.C., well-known social justice advocate lawyer, worked as Marshall&#x27;s counsel, and Order of Canada recipient Clayton Ruby was co-counsel for Marshall, along with Anne Derrick, during the 1989 Royal Commission on Marshall&#x27;s prosecution.

The Crown Counsel&#x27;s failure to provide full disclosure (contradictory and coerced statements by witnesses, because they believed the evidence not provided had no bearing in the case) brought about changes in the Canadian rules of evidence regarding disclosure. The prosecution must provide full disclosure without determination on what may be useful to the defense (that is the defense&#x27;s duty to decide).

==Compensation and aftermath==
A separate Royal Commission in 1990, headed by Justice Gregory T. Evans, concluded in June of that year to increase Marshall’s compensation from to a lifetime pension of . His conviction resulted in changes to the &quot;Canada Evidence Act&quot;, which was amended so that any evidence obtained must be presented to the defense on disclosure. Prior to this case, Crown Prosecutor had the discretion to present what they determined to be pertinent to a case. After 1983, the Crown Prosecutor must provide all evidence with no determination on its usefulness. The rationale of the law is that it is more appropriate for the defense to determine what may or may not assist an accused.

In response, a Royal Commission was formed to investigate what had caused the miscarriage of justice; this led to an influential case on judicial independence in Canada, &quot;Mackeigan v. Hickman&quot;.

==Fishing rights battle==
Subsequently, Marshall reached prominence as the primary petitioner in the landmark Supreme Court of Canada case &quot;R. v. Marshall&quot; [1999] 3 SCR 456 regarding treaty rights allowing Aboriginal people to catch and sell fish under the relevant treaties. In response to a charge from the Canadian government of catching and selling eels without a license, Marshall argued that his treaty rights superseded federal fishing regulations. The treaty right was established, and Marshall was acquitted.

==Subsequent arrests==
In January 2006, Marshall faced charges of attempted murder, uttering death threats and dangerous driving following a New Year&#x27;s Eve party in which Marshall was accused of attacking a man with a vehicle. The charges were dropped after both men agreed to participate in a restorative justice meeting.

In 2008, Marshall faced charges of assault against his wife, uttering threats against his wife and her ex-husband and breach of an undertaking.

==Death==
Marshall died 6 August 2009, in Sydney, Nova Scotia, from complications of a 2003 lung transplant.

== Legacy ==
The Membertou First Nation unveiled a statue to honour Marshall in 2010 outside the Membertou Trade and Convention Centre in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

Daniel N. Paul has suggested renaming the Cornwallis Square in Halifax, Nova Scotia the Donald Marshall Jr. Memorial Park and replacing the statue of Edward Cornwallis with one of Donald Marshall Jr.

<doc id="1128005" wikidata="Q1709072" url="?curid=1128005" title="José Cancela">
<text>José Carlos Cancela Durán (born June 25, 1976) is a Uruguayan retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He is nicknamed &quot;Pepe&quot;.

Before joining the Colorado Rapids, Cancela played the preseason with Toronto FC but was traded to the Denver-based club the day before the regular season began. Cancela played for Peñarol, Cruz Azul, Deportivo Saprissa, and the New England Revolution. He had to leave Saprissa, despite being loved by their fans, because of the rule implemented by the &quot;Morados&quot; after 2003, by which they could only use Costa Rican players in their team.

Cancela joined the Revolution in July 2003, and immediately added an attacking flair not often seen in MLS. He immediately slotted into the starting lineup, and finished the season with a goal and seven assists in 13 games. Cancela struggled a little in his second year, as Clint Dempsey emerged as a competitor for the attacking midfield position, but finished the year with three goals and ten assists in 25 games. He scored two goals and five assists in 2005.

After the 2006 season, Cancela was taken by Toronto FC in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft, but dealt to the Colorado Rapids in April of the following year in exchange for a Youth International slot to be held by Toronto until 2009. He was waived by the Rapids before the 2008 season.

<doc id="1128007" wikidata="Q1932542" url="?curid=1128007" title="Sheryl Crow (album)">
<text>Sheryl Crow is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow, released on September 24, 1996, by A&amp;M Records. Unlike its predecessor &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; was entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only two collaborators. Recorded largely at Kingsway Studios in New Orleans, Louisiana, the album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and moral and ethical issues, while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock, country, and folk.

&quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; was a commercial success, receiving triple platinum certification by both the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced five singles, including the international hit &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;. The album received acclaim from critics, who praised its intricate production and Crow&#x27;s louder and more assured performance. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the album won Best Rock Album and Crow won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the aforementioned single. Retrospectively, it is often regarded as Crow&#x27;s best album.

&quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; is the follow-up to Sheryl Crow&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, which was written by a group of musicians known as the &quot;Tuesday Music Club&quot;. The group existed as a casual collective formed by Crow and musicians Bill Bottrell, David Baerwald, Kevin Gilbert, Brian MacLeod, David Ricketts, and Dan Schwartz. The album was a commercial success and produced several hit singles, including &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;, &quot;Strong Enough&quot;, and &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. It was certified 7× Platinum in the United States and 2× Platinum in the United Kingdom. Crow was also awarded Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record of the Year at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards.

Tensions between Crow and other members of the group began to arise following Crow&#x27;s performance of &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in March 1994. Crow offhandedly agreed with the host when she was asked if the track was autobiographical, even though it was primarily written by Baerwald and based on the book of the same name by his friend John O&#x27;Brien. As a result, several members of the Tuesday Music Club group felt betrayed, and O&#x27;Brien himself committed suicide three weeks later. Nevertheless, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s parents insisted that Crow had nothing to do with the tragedy, noting that he &quot;was just mad about it [...] But the problems that drove him toward the end were – you know, that&#x27;s a long, long bloody trip.&quot;

After &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, Crow wanted to prove her authority as a musician. According to her, &quot;My only objective on this record was to get under people&#x27;s skin, because I was feeling like I had so much shit to hurl at the tape.&quot; Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; was recorded, but sessions were then relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow &quot;was feeling ghosts in that room&quot;. Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left because he could not sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studios in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine.

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; was described as a combination of rock, blues, alternative rock, country, folk, and light hip hop loops. Unlike its predecessor, it also features a more off-balance production and a richer instrumentation, with &quot;lots of fuzz, wurlitzer, hammond, moog. Nothing extreme, perhaps, but almost psychedelic when joined to big mainstream melodies&quot;, one critic explained. The album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and moral and ethical issues, among others. For example, &quot;Home&quot; is a folk ballad where Crow recounts the emotional difficulties of a deteriorating relationship, while &quot;Superstar&quot; deals with a woman fantasizing about stardom. The song &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot;, which features hand claps and organ licks, is about the need to escape a constricted life.

The opening track, &quot;Maybe Angels&quot;, was described as &quot;a cryptic ode to UFOs and government conspiracies that plays like an &quot;X-Files&quot; theme song.&quot; Crow explained that the song is &quot;an extraterrestrial yarn that finds Kurt Cobain joining John Lennon in heaven&#x27;s winged choir&quot;. The track &quot;Redemption Day&quot; is a protest against the US indifference to the Bosnian War. It was inspired when Crow visited the country as part of a USO trip with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. The song was later covered by Johnny Cash, appearing on his 2010 posthumous record &quot;American VI: Ain&#x27;t No Grave&quot;. The track &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; references abortion, while &quot;Love Is a Good Thing&quot; criticizes Walmart&#x27;s gun sales policy with the lyrics &quot;Watch out sister/Watch out brother/Watch our children as they kill each other/with a gun they bought at the Wal-Mart discount stores.&quot; The song caused some controversy, resulting in Walmart banning sales of the album at their stores.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;, underwent several different arrangements before being turned into a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, &quot;It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn&#x27;t, and usually when you find the right one it&#x27;s pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!&quot; Trott initially wrote the song when he was a member of Pete Droge&#x27;s backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, &quot;Sweet Rosalyn&quot; features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot; features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.

==Release==
&quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; was released on CD and cassette formats on September 24, 1996. The album reached number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold 143,000 copies in the first two weeks of release. As of January 2008, the album had sold 2,400,000 units in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has been certified three-times platinum by the RIAA. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and was certified three-times platinum by the BPI, signifying sales of over 900,000 units. Unlike the American edition, the British edition of the album contains the bonus track &quot;Free Man&quot;. &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; also reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. In Europe, it was certified platinum by the IFPI. A special edition of the album, entitled &quot;Sheryl Crow – Signature Tour Edition&quot;, was released in Australia and Japan in 1997. It contains the bonus tracks &quot;Sad Sad World&quot; and an alternate version of &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; as well as a bonus CD with six songs recorded live at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London on November 26, 1996. This 2-CD set was also released as &quot;Sheryl Crow – Special Edition&quot; in the United Kingdom in 1997.

The song &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; was released as the lead single on September 3, 1996, and became an international hit, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and selling 82,000 units in the first two weeks of release. It was also a success in the United Kingdom, where it reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart. Other countries where the single charted include Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Switzerland. A music video was made for the song under the direction of Keir McFarlane. &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot; was released on November 18, 1996, as the album&#x27;s second single. The song was also a success, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The tracks &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot;, &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot;, and &quot;Home&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s last three singles. &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot; was a modest success, peaking at number 16 on the Mainstream Top 40 and number eight on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; received acclaim from critics. Eric Weisbard of &quot;Spin&quot; praised the album&#x27;s production, stating that the record &quot;goes much further&quot; than its predecessor and that its &quot;bigger beats and dirtier guitar/keyboard effects [work] well with Crow&#x27;s literate hippie-chick persona&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated similar pros, commenting: &quot;If there&#x27;s such a thing as a professional lo-fi album, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; is it.&quot; He also noted Crow&#x27;s louder and more assured singing, concluding that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t expose that much of herself [...] she&#x27;s an emotional centrist. But at the very least, she&#x27;s building a bridge to a lasting career&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, J. D. Considine praised Crow&#x27;s vocals, especially on &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;, which he felt was probably the album&#x27;s best song.

Despite the praise, the last third of the album was considered the weakest part and the song &quot;Ordinary Morning&quot; was considered a poor choice for a closer. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke also criticized the album for being underdeveloped and lacking originality, and unfavorably compared the song &quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; to &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; by the Rolling Stones and &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; by the Velvet Underground. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau quipped that the album was indebted to &quot;not just Alanis but Tchad&quot;, later giving it a &quot;one-star honorable mention&quot; grade. In February 1997, &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; was ranked at number 26 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1996 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for the song &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine referred to the album as &quot;a postmodern masterpiece of sorts – albeit a mainstream, post-alternative, postmodern masterpiece. It may not be as hip or innovative as, say, the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;, but it is as self-referential, pop culture obsessed, and musically eclectic.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; highlighted the album&#x27;s &quot;quirky, stream-of-conscious lyrics&quot; and elaborate sound collages, stating that &quot;none of [Crow&#x27;s] other full-length albums have been as consistent, immaculately produced or distinctly modern.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; selected &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; as one of the essential albums of the decade. In 2002, the magazine also ranked it at number 44 in its list of Women in Rock: The 50 Essential Albums. In 2003, the album was featured in the Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums list by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine placed the album at number 39 in their list of Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; at number 475 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

<text>Hare Hall is a house and grounds located in Gidea Park in the London Borough of Havering, east London.

It was built in 1769–70 as a country house for John A. Wallinger and since 1921 has housed the Royal Liberty School.

The Palladian mansion was built to designs by James Paine, who included it in his published &quot;Plans&quot;. The main north front is of five bays, with a rusticated basement storey, above which the two upper storeys are unified by a giant portico and pilasters at the angles.

Attached to the south front by short corridors there were pavilions containing service rooms. The principal rooms were on the first floor, and were approached by a central staircase with curved ends and a wrought iron balustrade. 

The main front was of Portland stone, but the south front was of red brick. In 1896 the house was considerably enlarged on that side by filling in the space between the pavilions.

At the stud maintained at Hare Park, Cherimoya, foaled in 1908, was bred by the South African mining entrepreneur and horseman William Broderick Cloete; after Cloete&#x27;s death in the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, during the First World War Hare Park became Hare Hall Camp and housed the 2nd Battalion of the Artists Rifles.

<text>Simon Charles Jonathan Danielli (born 8 September 1979 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish former rugby union footballer who played on the wing for Ulster and Scotland.

==Early life==
Danielli who is of Italian descent, was educated at Cheltenham College and achieved an upper second class degree in philosophy and theology at Oxford University (Trinity College). During his time at Oxford he was awarded two rugby union blues playing in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1999 and 2000.

==Club career==
Danielli joined The Borders from Bath in September 2004, where he had been since the summer of 2001, prior to which he played for Bristol Shoguns.

With the Borders club being disbanded by the SRU in 2007 Danielli moved to Ulster. His try scoring feats for Ulster did not go un-noticed with the IRB stating he was close to making the IRB player of the year list in 2009. His rate of nearly a try every two games made him one of the most dangerous wingers in the Magners League.

==International career==
Danielli represented England Students and Under 21s. However, in January 2003 he opted to play for Scotland. He made his international debut against Italy during the World Cup warm-up match in August 2003 scoring a try. In his first start of the 2003 Rugby World Cup against the US, when he scored two tries in a Scottish victory and went on to impress throughout the 2003 World Cup tournament. He also scored a try in his Murrayfield Six Nations debut against England in 2004.

He dropped out of the international picture in 2005, but was recalled to the Scotland squad for the 2006 Six Nations championship. He was also picked as part of the Scotland 2007 World Cup training squad. He struggled to regularly break into the Scottish first-fifteen due to competition from the likes of the Lamont brothers and Chris Paterson.

However, he returned to the international scene on 28 February 2009 (against Italy in the Six Nations) with a try-scoring man of the match performance. He would continue to start throughout this campaign. After injury he returned to the Scotland team again for the match against Italy during the 2010 Six Nations Championship.

Despite Danielli having few starts for Scotland in the run up to the 2011 Rugby World Cup he started in Scotland&#x27;s opening game against Romania, scoring two tries in the 75th and 78th minutes saving Scotland from an embarrassing defeat.

==Retirement==
Danielli announced his retirement from professional rugby on 10 May 2012, after an injury disrupted 2011–12 season where he has failed to achieve fitness after a series of back injuries.

==Personal life==
Danielli was married to Olivia Danielli. They have three children. The couple married in 2009 and separated in 2014.

In April 2015, Danielli assaulted Michael Browne, suspecting him of having an affair with his wife Olivia Danielli. He was fined £500 in April 2017. In November 2015, he tested positive for cocaine.

In August 2015, Danielli&#x27;s estranged wife Olivia Danielli damaged his car, for which she was fined £500 and ordered to pay £1,800 in damage repair costs. This was challenged in 2017, with the defence claiming the car was legally the property of Olivia Danielli.

<text>Francis Hector Clergue (August 28, 1856 – January 19, 1939) was an American businessman who became the leading industrialist of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, at the turn of the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Clergue was born on August 28, 1856, in the American state of Maine. The &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; lists his birthplace as Brewer, Maine, while the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot; instead list Brewer&#x27;s sister city of Bangor. His father was Joseph Hector Clergue, a barber who was of French Huguenot origin. His mother, Frances Clarissa Lombard, was descended from 17th century American colonists who had originated in Kent, England; her father was a master shipbuilder.

He was born at a time when Maine reaped the economic benefits of timber and maritime economies. As a teenager, he delivered telegrams for the local railway stationmaster, exposing him to the rail transport industry. As a later businessman and industrialist, Clergue would repeatedly engage with these industries.

===Ventures===

Some aspects of Clergue&#x27;s early life are uncertain, and he may have studied engineering at the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, or taught school. He eventually settled on a legal career, working at the law office of Frederick M. Laughton. He was called to the bar in 1878. He began to practice as a solicitor in Bangor under the partnership of Laughton and Clergue. The two lawyers became very active in promoting various business ventures, such as a silver mining scheme in nearby Hampden. His schemes grew increasingly grandiose, as he promoted a variety of ventures in regions as far away as Alabama and Persia, and the scope of industries ranged from tourism, railways, public utilities, and shipbuilding. This included civic improvement projects in Bangor such street lighting and a street railway, a power station on the Penobscot River, an iron mine in Digby, Nova Scotia, a pulp mill, a foghorn manufacturing company, and new rail lines extending from Bangor into rural Maine; these ventures met with varying success. To support them, Clergue created the Eastern Trust and Banking Company as a financing vehicle.

Clergue was remarked on for his skill as a speaker, who could draw in potential investors even as many of his ventures failed. The biographer Duncan McDowall remarks that &quot;he possessed a knack for recognizing the potential of a new technology,&quot; but his ideas were often beyond practical possibility, and he lacked the technical knowledge and skills to implement them in realistic ways. Another biographer, Edward Allan Sullivan, described him as having &quot;the courage of ignorance.&quot; He committed extensive resources into developing tourism infrastructure on Mount Desert Island in Penobscot Bay in the Gulf of Maine, which by the 1880s was becoming a wealthy tourist enclave. This consisted of a large hotel along with a mountainside cog railway, both of which opened in 1883 but proved to be financial failures. Before the end of the decade, Clergue had moved on to even greater peaks of ambition when at the suggestion of Maine politician James G. Blaine, he sought to compete with British and Russian interests in Persia. With the decline of Qajar Iran amidst the Great Game between these twin imperial powers, western financial and development interests began to encroach on the country. Clergue made a bid for the long-term monopoly on banking, water utilities, and railways in Iran, but failed and had to return home in defeat. Similarly, a scheme to draw British investment to shipbuilding in Mobile, Alabama, was also a failure.

As a businessman, Clergue&#x27;s most notably developed concept was of industrial integration, a principle which he continually returned to and emphasized; he described it as &quot;the principle of correlation&quot;. Clergue believed that a cluster of related enterprises could achieve economies of scale if integrated successfully. His charisma and vision proved influential with politicians and financiers who, at the peak of the Gilded Age, were willing to invest in ambitious projects. By the 1890s, Clergue was backed by significant Philadelphia and New York investment interests.

===Arrival at Sault Ste. Marie===

Canada was a logical investment choice for American finance capital, and Clergue soon arrived there to scout for opportunities. Clergue initially planned to travel to Fort William, which commanded a strong position at the head of Lake Superior, to investigate the possibility of hydroelectric development. Along the way, he took an interest in Sault Ste. Marie, which had water and rail transport connections, but had been bypassed by the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s transcontinental mainline a decade earlier, and whose economy had stagnated with the decline of the fur trade. Local businessmen had attempted a hydropower scheme intending to capitalize on the rapids of the St. Marys River, but a construction disaster left the project unfinished, with a debt load of $263,000 hanging over it. Clergue, who had arrived in 1894, sensed an opportunity and bought up the defunct power company, promising Sault Ste. Marie a large injection of American investment. The town council in return gave him an exclusive 20-year franchise on hydroelectric power generation, as well as a 10-year municipal tax exemption.

Clergue was experienced at dealing with politicians, and sensed provincial and federal policies in the north around the development of &quot;New Ontario&quot;. Strategies like the National Policy championed by John A. Macdonald sought to grow Canada&#x27;s manufacturing base and encourage immigration through exploitation of natural resources, and numerous financial incentives were available to industrialists and promoters who would contribute to an increase in settlement. Clergue later remarked in 1901 that, &quot;Let the governments, by judicious general laws and by special grants of wild lands where justifiable, tempt the capitalist and the manufacturer to establish works for the utilization of these Canadian raw materials, and then they will have established an agency for immigration more efficacious than a legion of lecturers and a million maps.&quot;

===Initial industrial expansion===

Clergue soon expanded power generation at Sault Ste. Marie to a level where it could supply both municipal power and power for several industries, and used hydropower as the nexus of a whirlwind of industrialization. Only a year into his arrival, in 1895, the Sault Ste. Marie Pulp and Paper Company (later St. Mary&#x27;s Paper) was established. Clergue&#x27;s plan was to source the sulfurous acid needed for papermaking from Sudbury&#x27;s nickel mining and smelting industry, but the dominant Canadian Copper Company declined any deal with him. Clergue soon set his sights on the steel industry, but first he needed a ready supply of iron. With the 1897 discovery of hematite ore near Wawa in the northern part of Algoma District, Clergue quickly bought the mining claim and opened the Helen Mine, which was named after one of his sisters. To service the mine, he incorporated the Algoma Central Railway, one of the companies which is most associated with his legacy. With the line under construction, ore was transported via steamship.

In the east, near Sudbury, he purchased two nickel mining properties in 1899, naming them the Gertrude and Elsie mines, after other sisters of his. Similarly to his plans with the Algoma Central in Northern Algoma, Clergue planned for a railway to service the mines, and bought a paper railway, the Manitoulin and North Shore Railway (M&amp;NS), which had been chartered in 1888 to connect Manitoulin Island with the mainland. In an industrial synergy, Clergue planned for the mines to give him two resources he desired: sulfur for his pulp and paper operations and nickel for steel-making. Construction on the Manitoulin and North Shore Railway began almost immediately and, characteristic of Clergue, it was with an expanded charter which included an ambitious southern extension via railcar ferry across Lake Huron&#x27;s Georgian Bay from Manitoulin to Tobermory, and from there down the Bruce Peninsula to Meaford, Wiarton, and Owen Sound.

In 1901, construction began on Clergue&#x27;s steel mill at Sault Ste. Marie, which would ultimately become Algoma Steel. His railway and steel interests had the backing of several federal politicians, such the cabinet minister Joseph-Israël Tarte and senator Raoul Dandurand, and he was able to secure a lucrative contract with Andrew George Blair, the federal minister of railways and canals, to supply rails for the federally-owned Intercolonial Railway, as well as a mandate that all rails purchased for federally-subsidized railways be Canadian-made. Clergue also negotiated a contract to supply steel to Krupp, the German arms manufacturing conglomerate.

===Turn of fortune===

Captain of a fast-growing industrial empire that now employed 7,000 people, Clergue was celebrated by boards of trade, politicians, and the media as having conquered the wilderness of Algoma, which until this point had been little impacted by European colonization. Implementing his theory of industrial integration, Clergue formed the Consolidated Lake Superior Company, which had a controlling stake in all of the industrial interests he had founded, with most of the remaining shares held by his Philadelphia and New York financial backers. It was initially valued at million.

Signs of underlying problems began to appear as some of Clergue&#x27;s enterprises struggled to fully launch. His steel plant&#x27;s Bessemer converters began to come online, but the blast furnaces necessary to produce pig iron for the converters were still incomplete. To Clergue&#x27;s frustration, he was unable to manufacture steel at Sault Ste. Marie as an entirely internal process. By September 1903, the Algoma mill had produced only 1,243 tons of steel rails and was unable to service the loans it had taken out the previous year, a large part of the debt being owed to the Speyer financial interests of New York City. The company failed to meet its payroll obligations and the various Consolidated Lake Superior plants and mines were shut down. On September 28, the idled and unpaid workers rioted in the streets of Sault Ste. Marie, leading to the deployment of 350 militiamen, who were brought by train from Toronto.

The sudden collapse of the Consolidated Lake Superior Company created a panic amongst the provincial and federal governments. The government of Ontario guaranteed the workers&#x27; unpaid wages, while the Dominion government lobbied internationally in support of the company. Ontario premier George William Ross argued to the provincial legislature that the New Ontario project could not afford the loss of the Consolidated Lake Superior&#x27;s industries, making the Consolidated too big to fail. Despite these efforts, the company was put into liquidation on December 14.

Clergue spent several months rebuilding the company, which was reborn as the Lake Superior Corporation in February 1904. The Lake Superior Corporation was considerably streamlined compared to its predecessor, and some operations were never to reopen, such as the Gertrude and Elsie mines near Sudbury. With Clergue&#x27;s reputation in ruins, the new corporation instead had a Toronto promoter, Charles Douglas Warren, as its president, and a board of directors with three members chosen by the Ontario government, including the Toronto lawyer Newton Rowell. Within five years, Clergue was also removed from the board of directors, pushing him out of the organization entirely. The Lake Superior Corporation would go on to finish construction of the Manitoulin and North Shore Railway, which was renamed to the Algoma Eastern Railway, matching the naming scheme of other Lake Superior subsidiaries. Despite plans to extend the Algoma Eastern south across Lake Huron using a railcar ferry, as well as west to meet the Algoma Central, the line changed little until it was sold by the financially distressed Lake Superior Corporation to the Canadian Pacific Railway, which quickly abandoned much of the Algoma Eastern mainline that paralleled the CPR&#x27;s own Algoma Branch. Continuing to struggle during the Great Depression, in 1935 the Lake Superior Corporation came under the control of another industrialist, James Hamet Dunn, who once again salvaged and streamlined its operations to centre around Algoma Steel, which had become its flagship enterprise.

===Later years and death===

Clergue continued his work as an industrial promoter until his death, largely in a freelance consulting capacity, and was Montreal-based for much of the rest of his life. He created a new firm, the Universal Engineering Corporation, to act as a vehicle for his schemes much as the Eastern Trust and Banking Company and the Consolidated Lake Superior Company had been. He also became president of the Waterbury Tool Company, which manufactured hydraulic equipment. His interest continued both in transportation projects and in the potential development of the area around Hudson Bay, where the Algoma Central had once been intended to stretch to. He advocated for another east–west transcontinental railway (the &quot;North Railway&quot;) which would connect Montreal to James Bay and continue onward through the far north along the 60th parallel. Clergue was also an early lobbyist in the 1920s for the enlarging of the St. Lawrence navigational corridor, which would eventually proceed in the 1950s as the Saint Lawrence Seaway project, though he would not live to see it.

During the First World War, he joined the board of Canadian Car and Foundry, where he worked to sell munitions to the Russian Empire. Finally, near the very end of his life, he attempted to sell Canadian railway equipment to Manchukuo following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s.

Clergue died on January 19, 1939, in Montreal, and his remains were returned to the United States for burial at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor.

==Legacy==

Popular Canadian author Alan Sullivan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rapids&quot; (1920) is inspired by Clergue&#x27;s life. In 1946, Sir James Dunn, the then owner of Algoma Steel, commissioned Sullivan to write Clergue&#x27;s biography. Provisionally titled &quot;Before the Tide&quot;, it has never been published.

Despite Clergue&#x27;s dogged efforts to pursue integration of his various enterprises, they were ultimately broken apart piecemeal. While some, like the Gertrude and Elsie mines, did not survive the initial failure of the Consolidated Lake Superior Company at all, others survived in various forms even as the Lake Superior Corporation was unable to maintain its control of them. Clergue&#x27;s pulp and paper mill was eventually acquired by the Abitibi Power and Paper Company in 1928, then by a succession of owners until its eventual closure in 2011. The Algoma Eastern Railway&#x27;s 1930 lease to the Canadian Pacific Railway proceeded despite the Algoma Eastern earning a net profit in 1929, as the cash infusion from the lease was necessary to keep the Lake Superior Corporation afloat. The Algoma Central Railway evolved into the Algoma Central Corporation, and diversified into other transportation interests such as trucking and maritime shipping, as well as real estate. Algoma Steel and its related mining interests in Northern Algoma remained one of the most recognizable parts of the Lake Superior Corporation&#x27;s organizational system through the rest of the 20th century, and was eventually acquired by Dofasco in 1988.

Clergue had lasting popularity in Sault Ste. Marie, and in 1937 a portrait of him was placed in its city hall. Things in the city named after him include:
* Clergue Park - a small city park
* Clergue Street - short residential street
* French immersion school (F.H. Clergue Public School)

Clergue was inducted into Sault Ste. Marie&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2006.

<text>Richard Allan Ream (born August 8, 1961), better known by the stage name Rikki Rockett, is an American drummer for rock band Poison.
The band has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide and 15 million records in the United States alone.

==Biography==
Richard Allan Ream was born on August 8, 1961, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, the youngest of two children of Norman and Margaret Ream. He attended Cedar Cliff High School in Camp Hill.

In late 1993, Rockett discovered that the then guitarist Richie Kotzen of Poison was having a relationship with Deanna Eve, Rockett&#x27;s fiancée at the time. Kotzen was fired due to this incident. In VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, singer Bret Michaels said he never wanted to speak to Kotzen again.

In 1995 Rikki co-created and coloured the 6 issue comic book series, Sisters Of Mercy, published by Maximum Press.

After almost 20 years with Poison, Rockett released his first solo album &quot;Glitter 4 Your Soul&quot; on January 7, 2003, which was distributed online. The album was a tribute to 1970s glam rock. He also guested on Britny Fox&#x27;s &quot;Bite Down Hard&quot;.

On April 26, 2007, Rockett announced the creation of Rockett Drum Works Inc. It is a drum manufacturing company, specializing in the creation of ultra custom drum kits, snare drums and custom accessories. Prior to setting up his enterprise, Rockett worked for Chop Shop Custom Drum. He departed after conflicting opinions with Chop Shop founder Brian Cocivera. Rockett recruited most of the staff from Chop Shop along with some newer staff members.

In 2015 Rockett co-formed a new rock supergroup the Devil City Angels with guitarist Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns), bassist Eric Brittingham (Cinderella) and vocalist and rhythm guitarist Brandon Gibbs (Cheap Thrill).
Their self-titled debut album was officially released September 11, 2015.

===Personal life===
In October 2008, Rockett married longtime girlfriend Melanie Martel. On July 14, 2009, they had their first child, Jude Aaron Rockett. On March 2, 2013, Rikki and Melanie had their second child, a daughter named Lucy Sky. Both children are named after The Beatles&#x27; songs &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;. They separated in July 2015 and their divorce became final in June 2017.

Rockett holds a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, under trainer Renato Magno and trains at Street Sports Brazilian jiu-jitsu, located in Santa Monica, California.

Rockett is a vegan.

In December 2015, Rockett announced that he had been battling throat cancer. In July 2016, he reported that he is now cancer-free. In July 2021, Rikki celebrated the fact that he is still cancer free, six years after the original diagnosis.

<text>The Western Australia Police Force, colloquially WAPOL, provides police services throughout the state of Western Australia to a population of 2.66 million people, of which 2.11 million reside in the Perth Metropolitan Region. Western Australia has a land area of , making it the world&#x27;s largest non-federated area of jurisdiction.

==History==
===Early history===
The genesis of the police was the appointment of a Sheriff by Captain Stirling on 18 June 1829, as part of the proclamation of the Swan River Colony, charged with maintaining public order in Perth and Fremantle colonies. The proclamation provided for the appointment of a sheriff having under his direction a high constable, constables, bailiffs, and surveyors of highways. The Sheriff still exists as an officer of the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Department of Justice), but no longer has jurisdiction over police or highways. The Sheriff retains responsibility for enforcement of civil court judgments and the administration of jury service. Police do occasionally carry out Sheriff and Bailiff duties, particularly in remote country locations. 

Early colonial policemen were recruited by Magistrates and worked part-time, employed on a local, &quot;as needed&quot; basis. They were paid only for specific tasks, such as one shilling for serving a summons. By 1830, there were fifteen part-time constables in the state, of whom five worked in Perth.

A Mounted Police troop was established in 1834 as the needs of the colony changed, in particular after the introduction of convicts. This troop proved unpopular with citizens due to the perception that it was not efficient and was being paid out of their taxes for duties which the military should be performing. In the same year as its establishment, the Mounted Police were involved in the Pinjarra Massacre during with a large number of Aboriginal people where killed and after which Captain Ellis, the police superintendent, died.

In 1840, the first full-time constable for Perth was appointed.

On 11 May 1849, the colony&#x27;s Legislative Council passed a Police Ordinance which outlined police powers and responsibilities. The Ordinance noted that &#x27;distinct general and town police forces&#x27; did not yet exist.

Between 1849 and 1853, the police service in Western Australia existed in one form or another, whether based on the larger townships or created for special purposes, such as the Water Police and Convict Police. By, the mid-1850s, many colonists were petitioning the Colonial Secretary for a united force.

===Convict period===
After convicts started arriving in the colony in 1849, the police acquired the duties of registering and supervising ticket-of-leave men. By 1870, after transportation had ceased, some 1,244 ticket-of-leave men had to be supervised by 146 police employees.

Applicants for police service were required to be aged under forty, literate and physically fit. Leave was difficult to obtain for officers and officers were not to appear in public when out of uniform. Until the end of the nineteenth century, the monthly pay day was marked by a parade with band.

A Criminal Investigation Department was set up in 1873, although two detectives had been sent out from Britain in 1854. A fingerprint bureau was set up in 1902.

===Modern policing===
On 5 March 1853, the Western Australian Colonial Secretary, W.A. Stanford, signed a notice published in the Government Gazette, formally establishing the Police Force as a &quot;united, structured body&quot;. The Colonial Secretary appointed John Augustus Conroy as Superintendent of Police (sometimes referred to within the colony as Chief of Police): &quot;His Excellency the Governor directs the following appointments to be notified for general information: T.A.Conroy (actually J.A.) to be Superintendent of Police&quot;. On 15 March 1853, the Gazette published a &quot;Code of Rules for the Western Australian Police Force&quot;, signed by the Colonial Secretary on 11 March, which outlined a formal command structure and listed basic duties of commissioned and non-commissioned officers and constables.

The new Police Force officially began operation on 14 March 1853, when Conroy formally entered his duties, taking charge of police districts and making arrangements with Magistrates for the use of the police.

By 1861, the Police Force consisted of around 75 commissioned officers. In the same year, a second, expanded Police Ordinance was passed to clarify the chain of command, the powers and responsibilities of members, and the various offences they had to deal with. The Police Ordinance was superseded by the passage of the Police Act in 1892, by which time the Police Force had increased in size to approximately 225 men.

Since the police numbering system, a system wherein police officers are assigned a Police Regimental Number (PD Number), was introduced for members in 1898, approximately 1,112 had been paid for police services between 1829 and 1898.

Between 1861 and 1995, the Police Force was known as the Western Australian Police Department. It changed its name to the Western Australian Police Service in 1994. In 2017, Commissioner Karl O&#x27;Callaghan introduced a &quot;Frontline First&quot; policy, which included an organisation name change to the Western Australian Police Force.

Between 1898 and August 2023, over 10,000 men and women served in the Western Australian police.

=== Women in WA Police ===
Prior to 1917, women were not permitted to serve as sworn police officers in Western Australia. Discussions of female police officers were held in October 1915 but remained unfunded.

In 1917, after two years of concerted effort from women&#x27;s groups in New South Wales and South Australia, and amidst concerns that male officers were &quot;not resourced or trained to address ... the moral or physical wellbeing of the women and children of WA&quot;, Western Australia&#x27;s first female police officers, Helen Blanche Dugdale (1876–1952) and Laura Ethel Chipper (1879–1978), were appointed in August 1917 to commence duties on 1 September 1917 as Women Police Constables (WPCs) under the newly established Women Police Office.

Dugdale and Chipper were employed under the Police Act with full constabulary powers, but were officially commissioned to &quot;patrol slum neighbourhoods&quot;, &quot;look after drunken women&quot;, and &quot;obtain assistance for their neglected children&quot;. Early WPCs were initially segregated from the male policing divisions, being assigned to the female-only Women Police Office, and assisting male-only units as required.

In the early 1970s, the Women Police Office was disbanded and serving female constables were integrated into all aspects of policing with the same powers and duties of their male counterparts.

, women constitute 24.4% of sworn WA Police officers, and 25.4% of all WA Police staff, including three of 12 senior officers.

==Organisation==

The Police Headquarters is located in East Perth overlooking the Causeway, near the WACA Ground. The structure is entered on the State Heritage Register. The building fronting Hay Street opposite the WACA housed the former East Perth Lockup and a magistrate&#x27;s courtroom. Recruits are trained at the Western Australian Police Academy at Joondalup. Previously, the academy was located at Maylands, in premises still used by various units including the mounted and K-9 (police dog) sections.

The command structure has the state divided into eight major policing regions, with the metropolitan policing region sub-divided into eight districts. Policing command is divided into 3 major executive divisions:
* Executive Director (responsible for technology, workforce relations, assets and governance, and finance), 
* Deputy Commissioner for Operations (responsible for metropolitan and regional policing, and operational support), and 
* Deputy Commissioner for Professional Standards (responsible for standards and legal, state intelligence, state crime, and specialist and support services).

These executive functions report to the Commissioner of Police, which is the highest-ranking position within the Western Australian Police Force. , the Commissioner is Col Blanch. Politically, the service comes within the portfolio of the Minister for Police.

A number of specialist units exist within Western Australian police, including:

* Tactical Response Group (TRG), 
* Canine Section (K9), 
* Mounted Section, 
* Road Policing Group (RPG), 
* Police Air Wing, 
* Major Crime Squad, 
* Sex Crime Squad, 
* Child Abuse Squad, 
* Child Exploitation Operations, 
* Regional Operations Group (ROG), 
* Serious and Organised Crime Squad, 
* Emergency Management and Specialist Support Unit, 
* Water Police, 
* Traffic Motorcycle Group, 
* Rapid Apprehension Squad, 
* Breath and Drug Operations, 
* Homicide Squad, 
* Liquor Enforcement Unit, and
* Gold Stealing Detection Unit.
===Personnel===
, some 9,481 police staff were employed by Western Australian police, which includes 7,214 police officers, auxiliary officers, and Aboriginal liaison officers. Police staffing includes public servants, wages staff, and full-time employees, but not children&#x27;s crossing guards.

2023 staff figures saw a reduction in total staff employed by Western Australian police compared to the previous years&#x27; workforce profile. This came after several years of Western Australian police officers &quot;quitting in record numbers&quot;, attributed to &quot;poor pay and conditions, rigid leadership, [and] a lack of opportunity to share opinions and to progress careers&quot;. In early 2022, it was revealed that Western Australian police was struggling to attract new recruits and keep existing numbers amidst low morale issues within the organisation, prompting resignations of 40 police officers per month between January and June 2022.

===Police Auxiliary Officers===
, Western Australian police employed 366 Police Auxiliary Officers, who are non-sworn officers employed to support police officers through auxiliary functions. Duties include admission, supervision, and release of detainees at Perth Watch House and other station-based lock-ups, custodial support for drugs, firearms, and other evidence, processing and management of property and other articles seized by Western Australian police, transportation of detainees to-and-from courthouses and hospitals, and a range of other station-based support tasks.

Police Auxiliary Officers are distinguishable from sworn Police Officers by their maroon epaulettes, white name patches, and uniforms, which display &#x27;Auxiliary Officer&#x27; instead of &#x27;Police&#x27;.

Police Auxiliary Officers who are tasked with protective service duties are authorised to carry a firearm and Taser and are equipped with telescopic batons, handcuffs, and Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray. They have limited police powers and training lasts 12 weeks at the Western Australian Police Academy.

===Regional Operations Group===
Created in 2004, the Regional Operations Group (ROG) provides WAPOL with a specialist public order capability. Their main role is to attend and control violent situations, riots, to assist police officers requesting backup when none is available locally, or as an immediate response to serious emergencies, such as armed offenders (firearms) incidents, domestic violence, and related offences. While ROG operates primarily in the Perth Metropolitan policing districts, officers are occasionally deployed to regional policing districts to attend serious incidents.

The unit is split into three sub-units, North, Central, and South. North Metropolitan Operations Group provides specialist capability north of the Swan River, covering the Joondalup, Midland, and Mirrabooka policing divisions. Central Metropolitan Operations Group supports the Central (Perth) policing division, bounded by Karrinyup, Guildford, Perth, and Mosman Park. South Metropolitan Operations Group supports areas south of the Swan River, covering the Fremantle, Cannington, Armadale, and Mandurah policing divisions.

Regional Operations Group officers undergo intensive public-order training and typically carry extra equipment whenever they are on duty. ROG officers are also issued with AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles for counter-terrorism duties.

===Perth Police Complex===
In 2013, the organisation opened a new inner-city facility at 2 Fitzgerald Street, Northbridge. Accommodating up to 500 police officers, the complex includes the Perth Police Station, the Central Metropolitan District Office, the Northbridge Magistrate&#x27;s Court, and a new state-of-the-art Multi-Functional Police Facility named Perth Watch House. Before long, the police union complained that insufficient staff had been assigned to the new lock-up in the context of state government budget constraints.

===Commissioner of Police===

Traditionally, the Commissioner came from within the service, though in 1994 and 1999, police commissioners were head-hunted from outside Western Australian police ranks. In 1994, Victorian Bob Falconer APM was recruited from the Victoria Police Force where he had served as Deputy Commissioner. Falconer was effective in implementing the Delta Program, designed to achieve organisational and cultural change. Falconer later argued that internal measures were inadequate and that a standing crime and corruption commission was necessary to combat police corruption.

In 1999, Barry Matthews, then a Deputy Commissioner of the New Zealand Police, was appointed and served until 2004. Matthews was, however, succeeded in June 2004 by Karl O&#x27;Callaghan APM, PhD who had been employed in the Western Australian service since age 17 and was one of the service&#x27;s first officers to achieve a PhD. O&#x27;Callaghan retired on 14 August 2017 and was succeeded by Chris Dawson. Chris Dawson stepped down as police commissioner in July 2022 to become Governor of Western Australia. He was replaced by Col Blanch on 15 July 2022.

===Ranks===


==Equipment and weaponry==
All officers are armed when on duty. The standard firearm is the Glock 22 .40-calibre pistol. Officers also carry the X-26 Taser Electronic Control Device (ECD), often described as a less-lethal force option. Prior to the Glock transition officers were armed with a .38 Special Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 as well as some units using the .40 S&amp;W Smith &amp; Wesson Sigma.

Because of the weight of equipment carried on officers&#x27; belts, uniformed officers are issued with load-bearing equipment vests fitted with pockets to safely contain equipment including ammunition magazines for their service pistol, pepper spray, telescopic baton, handcuffs, Motorola APX8000 P25 radio, and police-issue mobile phone. The vests were traditionally navy blue in colour, however variants exist within the organisation, including a fluorescent yellow version, which is worn for some operations. All officers, Police Auxiliary Officers, and officers handling property, evidence, and detainees are required to use Axon bodyworn cameras while on duty.

In 2022, Western Australian police began the rollout of a new uniform standard. The standard uniform for General Duties police officers consists of black tactical boots, blue pants, a blue service shirt with the Western Australian police logo and epaulets bearing the officers&#x27; rank embroidered on both shoulders, a load-bearing equipment vest, and a branded hat. The refreshed uniform also includes a bulletproof, stab resistant vest which consists of a black lower section with MOLLE webbing system and an upper, yellow high-visibility section which bears a number of stitched patches, including the officer&#x27;s rank, their name and Police Regimental (PD) number, and the word &quot;Police&quot;.

Further specialised equipment utilised by the Tactical Response Group is detailed in .

=== Technological capability ===
The Western Australian police is amongst the most technologically capable police forces in the world, and have set a number of policing technology precedents in recent years, leveraging technology for dispatching, information and incident management, communications, investigations, and enforcement.

==== Apple iPhone and CarPlay ====
In 2019, Western Australian police announced the successful completion of an Apple CarPlay pilot program, which is the first time the platform has been used for operational policing anywhere in the world. The CarPlay program followed a deal with Telstra to provide iPhone 11s to all frontline police officers and select agency staff from Western Australian police.

In March 2022, Motorola revealed details of a world-first smart mobile solution for Western Australian police, which saw delivery of the &quot;world&#x27;s first public safety mobile [app]&quot;.

==== Starlink Satellite Internet ====
In September 2023, it was also announced that Western Australian police had successfully trialled low earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet for use in remote areas without mobile reception, marking Western Australian police the first law enforcement agency in the world to make use of Starlink LEO internet. The effort is part of a upgrade to Western Australian police&#x27;s communication infrastructure which will see the technology deployed to 550 vehicles and 129 regional police stations.

===Vehicles===
==== Unmarked vehicles ====
A significant number of fleet vehicles of varying make and model are used by Western Australian police for unmarked (covert) policing.

==== Vehicle equipment ====
All vehicles are equipped with standard technology packages, which includes a Mobile Information Management System Terminal (IMS Terminal), a Motorola XTL2500 digital radio system, an Axon in-car digital video system, and Apple CarPlay-enabled headunit. Some specialised units&#x27; vehicles, such as Traffic Enforcement Group and Regional Operations Group are also equipped with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems and automatic radar speed detection systems.

General Duties police vehicles (which form the vast majority of the fleet) carry additional equipment for general policing duties, including breath alcohol testing and drug testing facilities, firefighting equipment, defibrillators, spike strips, handheld radar speed detection gun, traffic cones and other traffic direction equipment, high-visibility raincoats, medical equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other occupational-specific equipment such as ticket books, incident report pads, vehicle-affixable stickers, and evidence bags, among others.

== Specialist units ==
=== Tactical Response Group ===
Tactical Response Group (TRG) is a police tactical group, a component of the Counter Terrorism and Emergency Response Command of WA Police.

Since 1978, the Australian Government&#x27;s National Anti-Terrorism Plan has required each state police force to maintain a specialised counter-terrorist and hostage-rescue unit.

TRG officers are trained for high-risk situations and provide support to police and other agencies. Such situations include dealing with armed offenders, attending sieges and civil-disorder incidents, protecting endangered witnesses, undertaking searches of premises, securing and escorting dangerous prisoners, heads of state, VIPs and internationally protected persons, as well as the state&#x27;s counter-terrorist responsibility. Specialist positions include marksmen, bomb technicians and negotiators.

The TRG is equipped with a wide range of less-lethal devices as well as specialist firearms and equipment for &#x27;domestic&#x27; and counter-terrorist operations. Training includes tactical roping, fieldcraft, water borne operations, paramedical courses, the use of chemical, biological and radiological equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and various weapons systems. Specialised vehicles include 2 Lenco BearCat armoured police rescue vehicles and a forward-command vehicle for emergencies and other major events.

The TRG has in recent times also expanded its capability to respond to counter-terrorist and high-risk incidents in a maritime environment including specialist divers, swimmers and the ability to board ships and oil/gas platforms.

=== Police Air Wing ===
Police Air Wing was formed in 1976 and provides support to frontline police, including deployment of police personnel, crime detection and prevention, search and rescue, and medical transfers.

The Police Air Wing fleet comprises:
*Helicopters
** one twin engine Airbus H145 D3 for special operations, transport and rescue
** one twin-engine Kawasaki BK117 for general operations and backup capability
*Fixed-wing
** one single-engine GippsAero GA8 Airvan
** two single-engine Pilatus PC-12
** one single-engine Cessna Caravan
*Remotely Piloted Aircraft System unit

The Police Air Wing has a primary base at Jandakot Airport, in addition to a PC-12 being based at Karratha Airport.

The Pilatus PC-12 is a single-engine turbo-prop aeroplane which can carry a maximum of eight passengers as far as Broome. It can cruise up to a height of and can travel at approximately . The PC-12&#x27;s primary role is to transport staff statewide, but it can be utilised for search and rescue (SAR) and disaster relief efforts. The Cessna 182 is mainly used for surveillance and patrol work and can be fitted with a Leo400 FLIR unit. It is also used for inshore and land SAR searches.

The Kawasaki BK117 is a twin-engine helicopter, which has been upgraded to B2 specification. Purchased in 1990, and known as Polair 61, the aircraft&#x27;s role is police patrol, surveillance, search and rescue and officer deployment. It is fitted with a Star Safire III FLIR unit with downlink capabilities, Avalex digital recorder, Avalex moving map system, four monitors, Wulfsberg tactical radio, Nitesun searchlight and a double-lift rescue winch. FLIR (Forward looking infrared) cameras track heat sources, such as a vehicle or human body in darkness and have a high-powered zoom video camera for daylight hours.

In September 2011, the Police Air Wing took delivery of a new Eurocopter AS365 N3 helicopter, known as Polair 62. The cost of the new helicopter has been reported at for the helicopter, plus of equipment enhancements including Forward Looking Infra-Red cameras, winches, and live surveillance with downlink capabilities to the Police Operations Centre.

In July 2020, the police force placed an order for an Airbus H145 helicopter to replace the Kawasaki BK117. In September 2021, a second order was placed for a H145 to replace the Eurocopter Dauphin.

==== Helicopter crash ====

On 8 May 1992, the police Polair One helicopter crashed while attempting to land on a sports oval for a public display in Kelmscott. The helicopter, an Aerospatiale AS355F1, was destroyed after a fire started in the engine bay following ground impact. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report determined &quot;The helicopter probably entered a vortex ring state during the final approach&quot;. The pilot and crewman received minor injuries, and the two passengers serious injuries, as a result of the accident.

==== Newman plane crash ====
On 26 January 2001, four police officers died when their Cessna 310R plane crashed at night near the mining town of Newman. The plane was returning from Kiwirrkurra, on the edge of the Gibson Desert, when the aircraft&#x27;s engines failed due to fuel starvation on the approach to Newman airstrip. The crash was the single biggest loss of police lives in Western Australian history, and the first involving a police aircraft. The officers killed in the crash were: Senior Constable Donald Richard Everett 4600 – 49 years - Pilot of Karratha Police Airwing; Senior Constable Phillip Gavin Ruland 7877 – 32 years - Newman Police Station; First Class Constable David Adrian Dewar 9178 – 31 years - Newman Police Station; Constable Gavin Ashley Capes 10305 – 27 years - Newman Police Station. A remembrance ceremony is held each year by the people of Newman to honour this tragic event.

==Aboriginal-run police station==
The first Indigenous-run police station is at Warakurna, a 4-hour drive westwards from Uluru, set up some years ago and already showing some positive effects. Filmmaker Cornel Ozies, who made a documentary about the station called &quot;Our Law&quot; and shown at the 2020 Sydney Film Festival, puts the success of the program down to four things: &quot;respect, understanding, communication, and education&quot;. The two Noongar police officers from Perth learnt the local Ngaanyatjarra language and cultural protocols of the Ngaanyatjarra people.

==Criticism==
=== 1975 Murder of Shirley Finn ===
Shirley Finn was a Perth brothel keeper and nightclub operator who was shot dead in her car around midnight on 23 June 1975 in South Perth. The murder of Finn has long been rumoured to have resulted from a police conspiracy with political ramifications. The specific circumstances surrounding Finn&#x27;s death, including her alleged sighting at the canteen bar of the WA Police headquarters in East Perth shortly before her murder, have never been officially disclosed, despite several purported investigations and a Royal Commission.

In 2017, following persistent public interest in the case over the years, a coroner&#x27;s inquest was opened to take evidence from witnesses regarding the killing, which sat through 28 days of evidence and heard from some 70 witnesses. The inquest returned an open finding with Coroner Barry King closing with the announcement that there had been &quot;incompetence&quot; in the police investigation and that there were &quot;too many suspects&quot;, while vital evidence had &quot;disappeared&quot;, including the murder weapon and the victim&#x27;s luxury car.

The Coroner&#x27;s report further acknowledged that the &quot;most compelling theory&quot; about why she was killed related to her &quot;[attempts] to blackmail police about corruption&quot;, with the report further providing &quot;it is a curious feature of this analysis that the circumstances of the murder and the existence of the motive appear to be interdependent.&quot;

No suspects have ever been formally charged in the matter and, as of 2023, the crime remains unsolved.

===Deaths in custody===

The 1987-1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody reported on the underlying social, cultural, and legal issues behind deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Amongst 99 cases investigated by the Commission was the violent death of a 16-year-old Aboriginal boy, death of John Pat, whilst in the custody of WA Police in Roebourne, Western Australia in 1983. Commissioner Elliott Johnston expressed public criticism over the lack of any disciplinary charges against five officers implicated in the violent death of a 16-year-old Aboriginal Boy, finding the circumstances and event of Pat&#x27;s death &quot;a most unsatisfactory state of affairs&quot;.

The 2002 Kennedy Royal Commission investigated the February 1988 death of 18-year-old Stephen Wardle, who died whilst in custody in the East Perth lockup. A particularly controversial aspect of the case was that 17 police witnesses declined to give evidence at the Coronial Inquiry &quot;for the reason that their evidence might have had the tendency to incriminate them.&quot; The Commission&#x27;s report noted: &quot;The Royal Commission has no authority under its terms of reference to go beyond the determination of whether or not there has been criminal or corrupt conduct by any police officer with respect to the death of Stephen Wardle. The evidence does not sustain any contention that there was corrupt or criminal conduct by any police officer or officers in relation to his death&quot;

===2002 Royal Commission into WA Police integrity===
Throughout the 1990s, there was widespread public concern about police activities and perceived shortcomings in internal integrity, resulting in development of draft terms of reference for a proposed Royal Commission by the Labor parliamentary opposition. In 2002, the Kennedy Royal Commission commenced to examine aspects of the behaviour and culture of the service. It concluded in 2004, finding that
&quot;...the full range of corrupt or criminal conduct from stealing to assaults, perjury, drug dealing and the improper disclosure of confidential information have been examined. [The Western Australian Police Service] has been ineffective in monitoring those events and modifying its procedures to deal with that conduct and to prevent its repetition. The fact that there remain in WAPS a number of officers who participated in this conduct, and who not only refused to admit it, but also uniformly denied it with vehemence, is a matter of concern.&quot;
In 2003, largely as a result of the findings of the Royal Commission, a permanent investigative Corruption and Crime Commission was established by the Government of Western Australia.

=== History of racism ===
On 12 July 2018, in a NAIDOC Week address, Police Commissioner Chris Dawson formally acknowledged a &quot;history of racism or &#x27;unconscious bias and publicly apologised to Aboriginal people for past mistreatment, sharing he &quot;[he wants] this to be a real movement in which we are going to act and police differently than we have in the past ... [and] we want to treat Aboriginal people as all people should be treated.&quot;

In June 2020, Western Australian Attorney-General, John Quigley, made comments to SBS News ahead of a &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; rally in Perth, marking &quot;systematic discrimination&quot; against Indigenous Australians in the state&#x27;s justice system. Quigley closed by saying that legislative reforms were being planned.

=== Investigative abuses ===

==== 2007 Corryn Rayney murder investigation ====
Corryn Rayney was an Australian-Ugandan refugee who was found dead in Kings Park on 16 August 2007. The circumstances surroundiung Rayney&#x27;s death remain mysterious with no clear cause of death being identified, though police announced early on that her death was being treated as a murder inquiry. Rayney&#x27;s husband, Lloyd Rayney, a prominent barrister specialising in criminal prosecution, was charged with her murder, but was found not guilty by Justice Brian Martin.

In handing down his not guilty verdict, Justice Martin was critical of some police actions, stating that &quot;there were instances of unacceptable conduct by some investigators ranging from inappropriate to reprehensible&quot;. He added that he had found &quot;no evidence that lines of inquiry were not properly investigated&quot;. Some five years before charges were laid, the Senior Sergeant in charge of the investigation had publicly named Lloyd Rayney as the force&#x27;s &quot;only suspect&quot; and the &quot;primary person of interest&quot;. At the trial, which extended over three months, the Judge found that &quot;the State case is bereft of any evidence [establishing] a crime scene&quot;. He concluded &quot;The case for the State is beset by improbabilities and uncertainties. Crucial evidence is lacking and the absence of evidence tells strongly against the State. Endeavours by the State to fill critical gaps and explain away improbabilities are primarily no more than speculation without foundation in the evidence.&quot; These findings were substantially upheld and vindicated by an appeal bench of three judges who unanimously dismissed the prosecutors&#x27; appeal, and upheld the trial judge&#x27;s analysis and verdict.

An April 2014 report of the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) cleared two police officers of any serious misconduct in the Rayney murder investigation. Their behaviour in threatening a female lawyer had been described as ranging from &quot;inappropriate to reprehensible&quot; by the trial judge. A second matter reviewed by the CCC related to &quot;attempts by a third officer to encourage an independent pathologist involved in the case to change a report to better fit police evidence. That officer was found to have acted unreasonably.&quot; In September 2014, lawyer and former State Governor, Malcolm McCusker, supported calls for an independent review, and also a CCC investigation of &quot;claims that police manufactured evidence to incriminate ... Lloyd Rayney&quot;.

As of 2017, the senior investigating officer in the Rayney murder case continued to regard Lloyd Rayney as &quot;the prime and only suspect&quot;, despite Lloyd Rayney&#x27;s comprehensive exoneration by the courts. A defamation action brought by Lloyd Rayney resulted in a record compensation award of over $2.6 million and legal costs of over $10 million.

On 21 April 2020, Lloyd Rayney was struck off by Legal Practice Board. Later the same year, Lloyd Rayney sued one of the lead forensic investigators on the case for allegedly making defamatory comments at a seminar at Curtin University in 2014. Lloyd Rayney was awarded in damages.

=== Wrongful prosecutions ===
Justice Martin&#x27;s criticism of the Corryn Rayney investigation followed the exposure of a number of notorious cases of wrongful prosecution by Western Australia Police, including those of John Button, Darryl Beamish, the Mickelberg brothers and Andrew Mallard, resulting in reversal of long-standing convictions and large compensation payouts by the Western Australian Government. In the case of Mallard, who spent 12 years in prison after an unjust conviction, a former WA Police Assistant Commissioner concluded &quot;Mallard is a very clear example of how police and prosecutorial misconduct can lead to a wrongful conviction and a miscarriage of justice ... It is also another clear example of the difficulties in holding people to account.&quot;

====Scott Austic====
A clemency petition drafted by the eminent barrister Malcolm McCusker, and lodged with the Western Australian Attorney-General in 2012, alleged that &quot;key evidence was planted, withheld and misrepresented&quot; in police investigations leading to a 2009 murder trial in which Scott Douglas Austic was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum 25-year jail term. After two successive Attorneys-General declined to act on the petition, a fresh petition for clemency was lodged in March 2018 with Attorney-General John Quigley, who also proposed legislation to allow people convicted of crimes to apply directly to the Court of Appeal. Quigley, formerly an honorary life member of the Police Union of Western Australia, subsequently became a fierce critic of the WA Police culture and hierarchy.

After spending over a decade in jail, in May 2020, Austic won an appeal against his conviction, and was acquitted at a retrial in November 2020. and is seeking compensation from the State of Western Australia. Reports by the state&#x27;s Corruption and Crime Commission in 2013 and 2023 &quot;formed no opinion of misconduct among police or prosecutors&quot; involved in the investigation or prosecution of Austic, and said &quot;limitations in evidence collected by police meant it was not possible to determine issues around evidence being planted.&quot;

Austic asked the Western Australian Government for in compensation but, in May 2023, was given an ex-gratia payment of , following &quot;comprehensive legal advice&quot;.

==== Aboriginal man, Gene Gibson ====
On 12 April 2017, Gene Gibson, an illiterate and mentally impaired 25-year-old Aboriginal man, was released from prison by an appeals court after unjustly serving five years of a manslaughter sentence. Gibson, who was 20 when charged with a two-year-old unsolved murder, was interviewed for many hours by two junior detectives without benefit of an interpreter or legal counsel, which ultimately led to a fake confession and wrongful conviction. Police Commissioner Karl O&#x27;Callaghan apologised for the investigative failure, but disclosed the three officers &quot;had not accepted blame and would now face an internal disciplinary process&quot;.

===Taser misuse incidents===

==== Robert Cunningham and Catherin Atoms ====
In November 2008, Robert Cunningham, an Associate Law Professor, and his wife Catherine Atoms, were tasered by WA Police officers during an arrest following an incident outside the Esplanade Hotel in Fremantle. Cunningham and Atoms were both taken into custody and charged with Obstructing a Public Officer. In 2010, charges against both Cunningham and Atoms were dismissed after a Magistrate described evidence given by one of the arresting police officers as &quot;extremely evasive&quot;, &quot;imprecise&quot; and &quot;unconvincing&quot;.

Between 2008 and 2015, Cunningham repeatedly requested that the matter be investigated to no success. In 2016, the couple launched civil proceedings against the State of Western Australia and the three WA Police officers involved. In December 2016, a District Court Judge, Felicity Davis, awarded over in damages over the incident.

==== Taser &quot;initiation rituals&quot; ====
In December 2010, two senior WA Police officers, a 53-year-old Sergeant and 45-year-old Senior Constable, were dismissed for lying to investigators during an internal inquiry into the misuse of tasers at Rockingham Police Station. Police Internal Affairs investigators found that, between October 2008 and May 2010, on a number of occasions, the Sergeant and Senior Constable misused tasers against other members of staff, including females, during bizarre initiation and farewell ceremonies to the station.

Police Commissioner Karl O&#x27;Callaghan noted that the primary reason for the officers&#x27; dismissal was that the Sergeant and Senior Constable had repeatedly lied to investigators during the inquiry, stating &quot;the final straw in this whole sorry saga was that neither of the two officers investigated told the truth to internal investigators when they were first required to ... they continued to deny the allegations and offered improbable explanations for their behaviour&quot;, and that one of the officers had to be interviewed six times in order to get a full and proper account of the incident.

It was further found that the officers had helped to form an &quot;unacceptable culture&quot; at the station, where &quot;junior staff felt unable to bring matters of concern to the attention of more senior police&quot;.

==== Repeated tasering of Aboriginal man on two occasions ====
On 31 August 2008, Kevin Spratt, a 39-year-old Aboriginal man, was tasered twice whilst in custody at the East Perth Watchhouse, later being charged with refusing a strip search. CCTV footage released years later, in September 2010, showing Spratt was subdued, sitting on a bench when the taser was first deployed. In April 2012, the CCC made several misconduct findings, recommended charges, and said police used &quot;undue and excessive&quot; force. In April 2013, it was reported that two senior officers were to be tried on criminal charges over the incident, though in a January 2014 hearing, the two officers were fined and given suspended jail terms for unlawful assault.

On 6 September 2008, Spratt suffered a dislocated shoulder, fractured ribs, and a collapsed lung in prison following a &quot;cell extraction&quot; wherein he was tasered eleven times by Emergency Support Group officers from the Department of Corrective Services. The CCC later found that seven out of the 11 taser deployments were &quot;reasonable&quot;, while no findings were made to the other four due to insufficient evidence. Spratt later pleaded guilty to the charge of Obstructing Police and was jailed for two months.

Between 2010 and 2019, Spratt was taken into custody a number of times by police after a number of assaults on police and other incidents.

On 24 December 2019, Spratt was again taken into custody after allegedly spitting at, bitting, and throwing his own faeces at two police officers as they tried to stop him from running away from Peel Health Campus where he allegedly assaulted a hospital worker. Two days later, while in custody Spratt was transported to Royal Perth Hospital to see a doctor, where it was reported &quot;when staff tried to x-ray him... they too were allegedly attacked&quot;. The December 2019 incidents came after a series of disturbing clashes with police, which the WA Police Union expressed concern in regards to Spratt&#x27;s aggressive behaviour, noting that &quot;Spratt&#x27;s aggressive behaviour has escalated to the point that numerous police officers and medical staff have allegedly been assaulted by him in separate incidents&quot;.

In 2019, at the age of 50, Spratt took his own life.

==== Person seated in vehicle ====
In March 2018, Grantley James Keenan, a Senior Constable was suspended for tasering a man seated at the wheel of his vehicle in Fremantle. The tasering had been deemed lawful by a police internal investigation, but was later described as unlawful, unreasonable and oppressive in a report by the CCC. In 2019, Keenan was found guilty of two counts of Common Assault against the motorist and received an eight month suspended prison sentence. Keenan was also ordered to pay a fine of and court costs of almost .

=== Charges brought against serving police officers ===

==== &quot;Clothes-line&quot; attack on motorbike riders ====
On 27 November 2010, an off-duty Senior Constable in WA Police&#x27;s &quot;Specialist Enforcement and Operations Team&quot;, Matthew Gerard Owen Pow, was charged with two counts of &quot;committing an act causing danger or bodily harm&quot; and two counts of &quot;assault causing bodily harm&quot;, after allegedly tying a rope across a Karawara path, known to be used by motorbike riders at night. Two boys, aged 15 and 16, sustained superficial injuries after falling off their motorcycles, later claiming Pow tied the rope across the path.

Pow appeared before Perth Magistrates Court on 4 January 2011. Pow&#x27;s defence argued that insufficient evidence existed for his conviction as the rope alleged to have been used was never located. On 8 March 2012, a jury acquitted Pow, finding him not guilty.

==== Police officer twice convicted of assault ====
In February 2019, ABC news reported that WA Police Senior Constable, Nathan Robert Trenberth, was filmed repeatedly punching a 20-year-old man in the head during the Sky Show celebrations. The presiding Magistrate described his use of force as &quot;unreasonable&quot; and convicted the officer of assault and fined him . Trenberth had a second conviction for assault in relation to an arrest of a man at a 2006 Australia Day fireworks display.

<text>South Australia Police (SAPOL) is the police force of the Australian state of South Australia. SAPOL is an independent statutory agency of the Government of South Australia directed by the Commissioner of Police, who reports to the Minister for Police. SAPOL provides general duties policing, highway patrol, criminal investigation and emergency coordination services throughout the state. SAPOL is also responsible for road safety advocacy and education, and maintains the South Australian Road Safety Centre.

 the commissioner of police is Grant Stevens, who has been in the role since July 2015.

== History ==
===Early years===
Formally established on 28 April 1838 under the command of Inspector Henry Inman, the force is the oldest in Australasia and is the third oldest organised police force in the world. The first force in the colony of South Australia consisted of 10 mounted constables and 10 foot constables.
In 1840, Major Thomas Shouldham O&#x27;Halloran was appointed as the first official Commissioner of Police. At this time, SAPOL consisted of one Superintendent, two Inspectors, three Sergeants and 47 Constables divided into foot and mounted sections. Between 1840 and 1842 O&#x27;Halloran led three &quot;punitive expeditions&quot; against Aboriginal people on the Coorong, at Port Lincoln, and on the Murray. This included reprisals following the Maria massacre where O&#x27;Halloran was sent out with instructions by Governor Gawler to execute &quot;any number, not exceeding three&quot; of the Aboriginal people identified to be involved.

The first police officer in Australia to be charged with murder was South Australia Police Force first-class mounted constable William Wiltshire. He is believed to be responsible for the deaths of more than 13 Aboriginal people, however his murder charge was eventually acquitted.

From 1848 to 1867, SAPOL also served as the state fire and rescue service, until the precursor of the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service was formed. They also supplied the Civil Ambulance Service from 1880 to 1954, when it was taken over by the St John Ambulance Service.

===Female officers===
In 1915, the first two female police officers, Kate Cocks and Annie Ross, were appointed. This was six months after New South Wales commenced with two officers. It had been said &quot;it is easier to get into heaven than to join the women police&quot;. Cocks retired in 1935, and was the officer in charge of the largest female detachment of all Australian state police departments of 14, which was double the size of the next-nearest of New South Wales.

In 1929, officer Daisy Curtis studied on a scholarship abroad to examine the &#x27;methods of protecting women and children&#x27;. This included travels to the jurisdictions of Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and New Zealand. (New Zealand did not get its first female officer until 1941.)

In 1999, SAPOL was the first Australian policing jurisdiction to appoint a female police officer, Senior Constable Jane Kluzek, to a tactical group.

=== Timeline of initiatives ===
* 1893: Introduced bicycles for metropolitan and country foot police
* 1893: Pioneered the fingerprint system in Australia
* 1987: The first Australian police service to introduce videotaping of &quot;suspect person&quot; interviews
* 1993: Introduced Operation Nomad, as a policing initiative to reduce the threat of bushfires
* 1996: Crime Stoppers launched
* 2000s: Established neighbourhood policing teams in various metropolitan areas
* 2011: The first police jurisdiction in Australia to launch its own web platform connecting mobile phone users to the latest police news

== Responsibilities ==
=== Commissioner ===
The commissioner of police, in addition to leading SAPOL, also serves as the State Emergency Coordinator and is responsible for major emergency response and command and control of major disasters, including bushfires, floods, and earthquakes. Under an emergency declaration, the commissioner has extraordinary authority to create rules and regulations that may be enforced by police, for a limited time. Due to these laws, Commissioner Grant Stevens became a central figure in South Australia&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The powers of South Australia Police are defined in the &quot;Police Act 1998&quot;.

 Stevens is still in the position.

===SAPOL===
In addition to general law enforcement such as patrols and investigations, SAPOL is responsible for other services throughout the state. These include:

* Operating emergency assistance call centres for police, 000 (emergency telephone number)
* Non-urgent assistance call centres, 131 444 (non-emergency telephone number) 
* Coordinating and managing emergency disaster response
* Road safety advocacy and education
* Registration and licensing of firearms
* Liquor licensing enforcement
* Security of public buildings and officials
* Police prosecutions
* Victim support services

== Organisation ==
SAPOL&#x27;s structure consists of various units. Through the chain of command, all units are accountable to the Commissioner. Services are the largest units, and are headed by a sworn assistant commissioner, or for areas which are not policing specific, such as information technology, a civilian Director. Services are directly accountable to either the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.

Services within metropolitan Adelaide are based on four different districts: North, East West and South. Each district has its own localised branch that provides specialised services or assistance, such as Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB), family violence, and intelligence sections. There are seven local service areas (LSAs) for remote and country areas within the remainder of the state.

=== Districts and local service areas ===

Districts and LSAs are the main organisational unit to provide policing services to the public. A district and local service area contains a number of police stations, as well as specialist services to support frontline police such as detectives, crime scene investigators and traffic police. Each LSA has a designated office known as a &#x27;Complex&#x27; where majority of operations in the area start. The LSA then have smaller community police stations for quick policing access.

Metropolitan districts and LSAs are divided into the Metropolitan Operations Service and the State Operations Service, which each have their own coordination branch and some other additional functions.

== Ranking and structure ==

=== Police Officers ===



All grades of constable perform the same basic range of duties, with the rank only reflecting experience. The rank of probationary constable is held for the first fifteen months of service. A constable with one stripe is qualified for promotion to senior constable. A senior constable first class is either an officer qualified for promotion to sergeant/senior sergeant or has won a senior constable first class position on merit. A brevet sergeant is the second in charge of a team and it can be a temporary designation for an officer in a particular position which would require specialised skills, such as a detective. 

A sergeant normally manages a team during a shift. A sergeant may also manage a small country station. A detective sergeant is normally in charge of a team in an investigations section. As with a sergeant, a detective sergeant may be the officer in charge of a country CIB unit. A senior sergeant is the officer in charge of a section, including traffic, criminal investigation, and operations (uniform), and traditionally does more administrative work than active patrol duties.

Officers of Police were formerly known as commissioned officers. This name was changed as SAPOL officers no longer receive a Queen&#x27;s Commission. Officers of Police act primarily as managers and generally do not partake in operational policing. An Inspector is in charge of a section. A detective inspector is normally in charge of the whole station CIB. A uniform inspector is normally in charge of the station&#x27;s operations.

A chief inspector commands a department at station level. A uniform chief inspector is in charge of all uniformed officers, regardless of their attachments to assigned areas (e.g. general duties, traffic duties etc.). Some country LSAs have chief inspectors as the regional commander. A detective chief inspector is in charge of all CIB-related matters.

Superintendents, chief superintendents and commanders may be the manager of a Local Service Area or Branch, such as the Major Crime Branch. An LSA commander is generally a superintendent. A chief superintendent may be the manager of a specialised area, such as a Service Coordination Branch. Few commanders are appointed. The Industrial Relations Branch has a commander as its officer in charge.

An assistant commissioner is the manager of a service, such as Northern Operations Service or Crime Service.

The Deputy Commissioner is the assistant to the Commissioner, who commands the organisation.

=== Police Security Officers ===
Police Security Officers (PSOs) (formerly Protective Security Officers) are armed security police officers originally employed by SAPOL to perform security functions at government properties, to provide security to protected persons (such as the Governor of South Australia) and to monitor metropolitan CCTV cameras. PSOs functions and duties have over time increased to include duties traditionally performed by sworn Police Officers. PSOs normally have limited powers and are limited to using those power in prescribed circumstances or locations, however, under current legislation passed in 2022, PSOs duties may be extended by the Commissioner of Police and they may be granted full police powers and immunities in the performance of those duties. PSOs were utilised in the states response to the COVID-19 pandemic. PSOs have their own rank structure.

== Uniform and equipment ==

=== Uniforms ===
SAPOL issues uniforms to sworn police officers. Police officers working in non-specialised areas generally wear a standard uniform, which consists of a navy blue collared shirt with attached police badges and navy blue slacks. Short and long sleeve shirts are worn as preferred. Police officers can choose between either a dark blue peaked hat or an Akubra wide-brimmed hat and are not required to wear a tie. Baseball caps are worn in specialist areas, including STAR Group, Crime Scene, State Traffic Enforcement Section, and by Operational Safety Trainers. Officers in northern country areas wear khaki uniforms instead of blue. PSOs (Police Security Officers) wear slightly different shirts. The shirts and slacks are also navy blue, but they have golden markings and PSO markings. In the past, the shirt was white. This was changed at the end of 2019.

In 2010 SAPOL started consultations on a new darker uniform reminiscent of those worn by officers of the NYPD and LAPD. In 2012 SAPOL announced the new uniform would be introduced in mid-October 2012 and would be rolled out over 18 months. The only visible change from the consultation period was to the peaked cap. The white peak was changed to the same dark blue as the shirt and pants, which is called ink blue. SAPOL has implemented the use of stab-resistant vests for all patrol officers, PSOs and Police dogs.

===Equipment and weaponry ===

Standard equipment issued to almost all officers are:
* Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .40 S&amp;W semi-automatic pistol
* Pepper spray 
* ASP Extendable Baton
* Handcuffs
* Taser
* Light ballistic vest
* Bodycam

Criminal Investigation Officers are issued with the compact version of the semi-automatic pistol (M&amp;Pc). Specialised units such as Special Tasks and Rescue (STAR Group) use other equipment suited to the nature of their duties. SA Police were among the last to carry revolvers as a duty weapon. They carried Smith &amp; Wesson Model 66 (a variant of the Model 19) revolvers in .357 Magnum until the switch to the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P semi automatic in 2009. Thousands of SAPOL legacy firearms have been traded in with manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson to sell on the second-hand gun market in USA. Australia (along with Uganda and Namibia) is one of few countries which has not declared a policy of preferential destruction of surplus weapons. Allowing South Australian Police firearms to be sold in second-hand markets overseas has been criticised as unethical by victims groups for its potential contribution to gun violence in USA. 

Drones have been used for surveillance since June 2013.

In July 2020, a new rapid response armed unit the Security Response Section consisting of 48 officers who carry semi-automatic rifles became operational. The establishment of this unit was criticised for its lack of consultation, the broader militarisation of police, contributions to &quot;police-industrial complex&quot;, and potential for harassment of marginalised groups such as homeless people, people from low-socioeconomic areas, and BIPOC communities.

== Transport ==

=== Vehicles ===
SAPOL officers use a number of vehicles in day-to-day duties. For much of its history SAPOL has used the Holden Commodore as its primary vehicle. Since the phasing out of the Holden Commodore SAPOL has recently switched to the Kia Sorento and Toyota RAV 4 as general duties vehicles. 

The Volkswagen Tiguan has recently been introduced primarily for traffic related duties. SAPOL also uses vehicles including the Toyota Kluger, Mitsubishi Outlander and Toyota Camry. Also used are VW Transporter, Toyota Hilux, Holden Colorado, Isuzu D-MAX caged vehicles for prisoner transport and the 2-Door Ford Ranger with canopy for the Dog Operations Unit. In remote country areas, Toyota Land Cruisers and Troop Carriers are used as primary patrol vehicles. Patrol cars are used in both marked and unmarked variants, with the latter being a bit more extensive in its vehicle composition. SAPOL have also, in previous years, used high performance vehicles such as Holden&#x27;s SS Commodore for traffic operations.

Members of the State Traffic Enforcement Section ride marked and unmarked Honda and BMW motorcycles for traffic, escort, and other duties.

=== Specialised vehicles ===

SAPOL utilise specialised Vehicles which are used in a wide variety of ways, for example, as a mobile police station/unit at a large public function, or as forward command posts at search and rescues, or other incidents such as siege or hostage situations. STAR Group also possess a Lenco BearCat armoured vehicle available for use in a siege or terrorist situations.

=== Watercraft ===
The SAPOL Water Operations Unit uses a number of watercraft including boats and Jet Skis to police coastal and inland waterways.

=== Mounted branch ===

For ceremonial activities, crowd control and patrol duties, the SAPOL Mounted Operations Unit use grey horses. Until 2024, they were bred and trained at the Thebarton Police Barracks, in Park 27 of the Adelaide Park Lands, just northeast of the Adelaide city centre. These &quot;police greys&quot;, as they are known, are ideal for police work as the light grey tones make the horse highly visible at night. They are also highly recognisable in the community and are often involved in community events such as leading the annual Credit Union Christmas Pageant and ANZAC Day parade. 

The Thebarton Police Barracks have now been demolished to make way for a new Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital and the &#x27;police greys&#x27; relocated to a purpose built facility in Gepps Cross.

=== Aircraft ===
Members of STAR Group and Transit Services Branch act as crew members on a modified Airbus Helicopters H145 Helicopter (callsign PolAir 53) which features an array of thermal and imaging sensors and is marked in a SAPOL livery. SAPOL also use a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft which is used to convey Police and prisoners across the state.
== Training and education ==

Recruit training is conducted at the SAPOL Police Academy located adjacent to the old barracks adjacent to Fort Largs in the north-western Adelaide suburb of Taperoo. Cadets undergo a 52-week course, called the &quot;Constable Development Program&quot; (CDP). The CDP is broken down into five phases, which includes training at the Police Academy and field experience at metropolitan LSAs. Police cadets learn law, about investigations and police procedures. During recruit training, non-officers (police staff and volunteers) assist with various duties, such as cadet assessment, role playing and general administration. Cadets also undertake operational safety training, including self-defence and the use of firearms. Practical role-playing and assessments are part of the course. Training with police dogs and police horses is offered at the Thebarton Police Barracks. Earlier, training was being held at the older Academy located next to the present one.

=== Graduation and aftermath for new officers ===

Cadets graduate with the rank of probationary constable and are subject to a 15-month period of on-the-job training. Probationary Constables are required to work with a Field Tutor for the first 6 months of the probationary period whilst they complete a Personal Learning Portfolio. Probationary Constables also undertake a range of duties to enhance their learning, including traffic, prisoner management, and general duties. For the following 6 months, probationary constables continue to collect evidence of their workplace competency before attending the Probationary Constable Assessment Workshop to determine whether they are suitable to progress to the rank of constable. Upon completion of the probationary period, officers receive a Diploma of Public Safety (Policing) and are appointed to the rank of Constable.

Training is ongoing and further courses are available for officers to attend, should they wish to progress their policing career further.

SAPOL Protective Security Officers also undergo training at this location. The duration of this training course is only 12 weeks.

== Radio communications ==

SAPOL refers to the communications operation as &quot;VKA&quot;. At 0400 hours (4am) on Tuesday 10 December 2002, SAPOL officially switched from standard 64 UHF channels to the SA Government Radio Network (SAGRN). This utilised digital encrypted radio transmissions, meaning that scanners could not listen to police communications. 

SAPOL still have UHF licences and it is plausible they are available as back-up communication channels. SAPOL uses three primary devices for voice communication over the network. They are Spectra W7 mobile, XTS 5000 portable and Spectra W3 mobile. These can be controlled via the RCH3000 desktop controller, used in fixed locations generally by trained operators. 

These devices have a number of features that are regularly used in patrols. These features include private call, page alert and telephone interconnect. 

Private call allows units to directly talk to another unit without dispatch, or other users in the talkgroup, hearing. However, this comes with the inability for dispatch to contact either unit. Page function alerts another radio that someone else is attempting to contact them. Telephone interconnect enables units to make and answer calls through the system. However, only supervisors have the ability to make and answer to any number, general patrols are restricted to only a list of certified SAPOL numbers. Each LSA has two assigned &#x27;talkgroups&#x27;. 

COMCEN (Communications) have assigned talkgroup IDs, allowing them to pair an LSA&#x27;s primary and secondary talkgroups together allowing control to manage two channels at once. The Secondary channel is often used for local/chat, dispatch lowers the volume of the secondary channel, which enables them to monitor the channels and talk to all units on duty in the LSA.

=== Call signs and unit designation identification system ===

SAPOL use location-based call signs. Units are called in by stating the station they come from followed by a designated number.

Examples:
* A unit in Holden Hill could be Holden Hill 16. 
* Traffic Services place a zero (0) before the number, for example, Holden Hill 016 would be a traffic patrol in Holden Hill with the call sign 16. 
* Higher-ranked officers have a different prefix. This is followed after the station name, and before the unit number:
** Sergeant = Vixen
** Senior sergeant = Mitre
** Inspector/chief inspector = Trojan
** Superintendent/chief superintendent = Baron
** Example: Holden Hill Mitre 10 is a senior sergeant in Holden Hill with the unit number 10.

== Notable incidents ==

In 1988, Detective Chief Inspector Barry Moyse - formerly in charge of the drug squad - was himself convicted of trafficking heroin and other drugs that he had seized from dealers, and sentenced to 21 years imprisonment, of which he served ten years before being paroled. He died in 2010 at the age of 65.

In 1994, a bombing at the National Crime Authority Adelaide offices killed Western Australian Police Detective Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen and severely injured others. The bomb was concealed in a parcel that was addressed to Bowen. Domenic Perre, who had been identified as a person of interest shortly after the bombing and a known crime figure was convicted of the bombing in 2022.

During the 2016 South Australian blackout, SAPOL Commissioner Grant Stevens declared a major incident under the &quot;Emergency Management Act 2004&quot;. During the incident, police officers who were not responding to distress calls were ordered to undertake traffic control duties in the stormy conditions due to all traffic lights around the state becoming inoperable.

On 16 November 2023, Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig was shot and killed and another officer wounded on a rural property north of Bordertown, after responding with two other officers to a report of someone shooting a dog. Police returned fire, resulting in the perpetrator, a 26 year old male, receiving life-threatening gunshot wounds. The death of Jason took the number of SA officers killed in the line of duty to 62. Less than two months later, a female police officer died on duty at the Port Adelaide police station.

<text>Sir Geoffrey Rudolph Elton (born Gottfried Rudolf Otto Ehrenberg; 17 August 1921 – 4 December 1994) was a German-born British political and constitutional historian, specialising in the Tudor period. He taught at Clare College, Cambridge, and was the Regius Professor of Modern History there from 1983 to 1988.

== Early life ==
Ehrenberg (Elton) was born in Tübingen, Germany. His parents were the Jewish scholars Victor Ehrenberg and Eva Dorothea Sommer. In 1929, the Ehrenbergs moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia. In February 1939, the Ehrenbergs fled to Britain. Ehrenberg continued his education at Rydal School, a Methodist school in Wales, starting in 1939. After only two years, Ehrenberg was working as a teacher at Rydal and achieved the position of assistant master in mathematics, history and German.

There, he took courses via correspondence at the University of London and graduated with a degree in Ancient History in 1943. Ehrenberg enlisted in the British Army in 1943. He spent his time in the Army in the Intelligence Corps and the East Surrey Regiment, serving with the Eighth Army in Italy from 1944 to 1946 and reaching the rank of sergeant. During this period, Ehrenberg anglicised his name to Geoffrey Rudolph Elton. After his discharge from the army, Elton studied early modern history at University College London, graduating with a PhD in 1949.

Under the supervision of J. E. Neale, Elton was awarded a PhD for his thesis &quot;Thomas Cromwell, Aspects of his Administrative Work&quot;, in which Elton first developed the ideas that he was to pursue for the rest of his life. Elton naturalised as a British subject in September 1947.

== Career ==
Elton taught at the University of Glasgow and from 1949 onwards at Clare College, Cambridge and was the Regius Professor of Modern History there from 1983 to 1988. Pupils included John Guy, Diarmaid MacCulloch, Susan Brigden and David Starkey. He worked as publication secretary of the British Academy from 1981 to 1990 and served as the president of the Royal Historical Society from 1972 to 1976. Elton was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1986 New Year Honours.

=== &quot;The Tudor Revolution in Government&quot; ===
Elton focused primarily on the life of Henry VIII but also made significant contributions to the study of Elizabeth I. Elton was most famous for arguing in his 1953 book &quot;The Tudor Revolution in Government&quot; that Thomas Cromwell was the author of modern, bureaucratic government, which replaced medieval, household-based government. Until the 1950s, historians had played down Cromwell&#x27;s role by calling him a doctrinaire hack who was little more than the agent of the despotic Henry VIII. Elton, however, made Cromwell the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government. Elton portrayed Cromwell as the presiding genius, much more so than the King, in handling the break with Rome and the laws and administrative procedures that made the English Reformation so important. Elton wrote that Cromwell was responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms by creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of church lands and thoroughly removing the medieval features of the central government.

That change took place in the 1530s and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. In essence, Elton was arguing that before Cromwell, the realm could be viewed as the King&#x27;s private estate writ large and that most administration was done by the King&#x27;s household servants rather than by separate state offices. Cromwell, Henry&#x27;s chief minister from 1532 to 1540, introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King&#x27;s household from the state and created a modern bureaucratic government. Cromwell shone Tudor light into the darker corners of the Realm and radically altered the role of Parliament and the competence of Statute. Elton argued that by masterminding such reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England&#x27;s future stability and success.

==Influence==
Elton elaborated on his ideas in his 1955 work, the bestselling &quot;England under the Tudors&quot;, which went through three editions, and his Wiles Lectures, which he published in 1973 as &quot;Reform and Renewal: Thomas Cromwell and the Common Weal&quot;.

His thesis has been widely challenged by younger Tudor historians and can no longer be regarded as an orthodoxy, but his contribution to the debate has profoundly influenced subsequent discussion of Tudor government, particularly on the role of Cromwell.

=== Historical perspective ===

Elton was a staunch admirer of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. He was also a fierce critic of Marxist historians, who he argued were presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the English Civil War was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was largely due to the incompetence of the Stuart kings. Elton was also famous for his role in the Carr–Elton debate when he defended the nineteenth century interpretation of empirical, &#x27;scientific&#x27; history most famously associated with Leopold von Ranke against E. H. Carr&#x27;s views. Elton wrote his 1967 book &quot;The Practice of History&quot; largely in response to Carr&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;What is History?.&quot;

Elton was a strong defender of the traditional methods of history and was appalled by postmodernism, saying, for example, that &quot;we are fighting for the lives of innocent young people beset by devilish tempters who claim to offer higher forms of thought and deeper truths and insights – the intellectual equivalent of crack, in fact. Any acceptance of these theories – even the most gentle or modest bow in their direction – can prove fatal.&quot; Ex-pupils of his such as John Guy claim he did embody a &quot;revisionist streak,&quot; reflected both in his work on Cromwell, his attack on John Neale&#x27;s traditionalist account of Elizabeth I&#x27;s parliaments, and in his support for a more contingent and political set of causes for the English Civil War of the mid-seventeenth century.

In 1990 Elton was one of the leading historians behind the setting up of the History Curriculum Association. The Association advocated a more knowledge-based history curriculum in schools. It expressed &quot;profound disquiet&quot; at the way history was being taught in the classroom and observed that the integrity of history was threatened.

Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analysing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. For instance, his 1963 book &quot;Reformation Europe&quot; is in large part concerned with the duel between Martin Luther and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Elton objected to cross-disciplinary efforts such as efforts to combine history with anthropology or sociology. He saw political history as the best and most important kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as Marxism.

== Family ==
Elton was the brother of the education researcher Lewis Elton and the uncle of Lewis&#x27;s son, the comedian and writer Ben Elton. He married a fellow historian, Sheila Lambert, in 1952. Elton died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge on 4 December 1994.

==Works==

He edited the second edition of the influential collection &quot;The Tudor Constitution&quot;. In it, he supported John Aylmer&#x27;s basic conclusion that the Tudor constitution mirrored that of the mixed constitution of Sparta.

<doc id="1128056" wikidata="Q1950101" url="?curid=1128056" title="Motueka River">
<text>The Motueka River is located in the north of the South Island of New Zealand and is a popular tourist destination for watersports and fishing. The Motueka flows from the mountains 40 km west of the city of Nelson in the southeast of the catchment and flows north to the Tasman Bay.

==Geography==
The Motueka River lies 60 kilometres to the south of Nelson, and flows for 120 kilometres, first through rough hill country and then the more gently undulating terrain southwest of Tasman Bay, passing by many small communities such as Ngātīmoti, Woodstock, Riwaka, Brooklyn and many others as it makes its way its outflow into the bay close to the town of Motueka. These communities are connected to the town of Motueka in the north and in the south by the Motueka Valley Highway.

The Motueka has three major tributaries, the Motupiko River, Wangapeka River and the Baton River, as well as smaller tributaries called the Pearse, Dove, Tadmor, and Rainy.

==Geology==
The river runs through a wide band of granite and areas of recent alluvium, with a complex mix of sedimentary and igneous rocks, originating from the mountainous terrain of the Arthur Range which form the western boundary of the catchment area. and a region of clay-bound gravels to the eastern boundary. As well as the granites, the wide variety of rock types found along the course of the river include complex basement rock, ultramafic, old and young sedimentary rocks.

==Flooding and river flow==
The Motueka is a large river with average annual flow of 59 cubic meters per second and a flow range from 6 to more than 
2,100 cubic meters per second. The average monthly flow has seasonal variation and it at its highest in winter and
spring. The mountain catchment areas to the west and southeast have the highest rainfall and provide most of the mean annual flow for the Motueka River. Significant flooding was a serious problem for the local population and a major flood in 1877 led to widespread erosion and changed the course of the river in several areas. There have since been serious flooding in January 1895, July 1929, June 1954 and April 1957 but this was thought to have been addressed when the Motueka Catchment Control Scheme was completed in 1982. In May 2010, however, twenty homes were flooded by the Motueka River in the Wangapeka area near Tapawera and residents had to be evacuated.

==Fishing==
The river is well known for its excellent Brown trout fishing throughout its entire length. Large numbers of trout range below the Wangapeka confluence and very large trophy fish have been caught.

==Watersports==
The river is also noted for rafting, canoeing or just drifting down on an inner-tube. Kayaks can be hired from a number of commercial companies and organised trips are available.

==Invasive algae==
Precautions have been taken to control the spread of an invasive algae &quot;Didymosphenia geminata&quot;, commonly known as &#x27;didymo&#x27; or &#x27;rock snot&#x27;, a species of diatom, in the Motueka River and its tributaries. This algae grows in warm and shallow water and can form large mats on the bottom of rivers. It is not considered a health risk but can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish and make recreational activities unpleasant. It is considered a nuisance organism or invasive species. The microscopic algae can be spread in a single drop of water, so anglers must clean their waders and boots before moving to different rivers or face a fine of up to $100,000 or up to five years in prison.

==Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) project ==
The Motueka River has a wide range of land uses over its catchment of over 2000 square kilometers which include agriculture, with hops, tobacco, Asian pears and kiwifruit grown on the banks of the middle and the lower reaches and commercial forestry on lowland and hill areas. The livestock farming uses include sheep and beef farming and, increasingly, dairy farming, which requires a number of cow crossings on the river that can affect water quality, through introducing fecal coliform microbes and conflict with sports such as fishing. A special research project was therefore established as part of a nine-year programme that began in July 2000 and ended in September 2010. The aim of the research was to provide information to support the management of the environment of the area using an &#x27;Integrated Catchment Management&#x27; (ICM) approach. This recognises the catchment or river basin as an ecosystem and includes consideration of social, economic and political factors.

==Water quality==
The Motueka River is relatively unpolluted compared to most New Zealand rivers and usually meets the water quality requirements for swimming under baseflow conditions.

<doc id="1128057" wikidata="Q2936300" url="?curid=1128057" title="Candle Records">
<text>Candle Records was an independent record label that operated from 1994 to 2007. Candle Records was originally based in Melbourne, Australia and founded in September 1994 by Chris Crouch.

The label concentrated only on local bands with an &quot;emphasis on strong lyrics and a wistful, often humorous Australian feel&quot; and was run more like a co-op than a corporation. Bands on the label would help each other, promoting the label and CD releases, as well as doing shows together. The first release by the label was The Simpletons&#x27;s EP, &quot;The Nod&quot;, in October 1994. This was followed later that year by The Lucksmiths&#x27; &quot;Boondoggle&quot; and Cuddlefish&#x27;s &quot;Grap&#x27;s Fruity Elixir&quot;.

Candle went on to have over 100 releases. They took over independent record shop, PolyEster Records, on Melbourne&#x27;s Brunswick Street and opened a Sydney office ran by Danielle Atkinson. Crouch decided to close the label down on 31 March 2007, citing &quot;time for a change&quot;. The last release by the label was Darren Hanlon&#x27;s single, &quot;Elbows&quot;, in February 2007.

Just before closing down the record label, Candle put on a big farewell show that toured the east coast of Australia. Starting in Brisbane, and then moving to Sydney and finally Melbourne, the all-star show consisted of sets by regular Candle family members The Lucksmiths, Darren Hanlon, Anthony Atkinson and the Running Mates, The Girls From The Clouds, Mid-State Orange and The Small Knives. The Sydney gig, and the first of the two Melbourne shows, notably ended with an all-star cast performing an encore of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;We Are The World&quot;.

<text>Tapawera is a small town in the Tasman District of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located southwest of Nelson and southeast of Motueka. It is situated on the Motueka Valley Highway (formerly ) by the banks of the Motueka River.

==History==
Tapawera began its life when the Nelson Section railway edged down the Motueka Valley at the opening of the 20th century. Before the railway construction in the area the Ferry Inn at the ford crossing of the Motueka River was the only building in the vicinity.

The railway construction camp was situated there for several years and was named Maniaroa after a nearby farming property.

As the railway advanced down the valley growth came with it. A butchery and bakery were followed by a grocery store, and in 1902 the Upper Motueka Valley School was relocated to Maniaroa using a traction engine. The name Tapawera came with the opening of a Post Office in 1905 and the railway station in 1906.

Tapawera was soon acting as a centre for the surrounding area, supplanting Upper Motueka Valley as the largest settlement beyond Spooners. Upper Motueka Valley lost not only its pre-eminence but its name when it was renamed Mararewa after the station.

==Economy==
Generally agriculture has surrounded Tapawera but berry growing has been notable up the Tadmor Valley.

Hop growing has been a feature of the Rakau area towards Tadmor for about a century and has boomed in recent years nearer Tapawera itself so that there are hop farms along the Motueka Valley Highway between the township and Kohatu, from the township heading towards Motueka, and up the Tapawera-Baton Road.

== Attractions ==
Tapawera is a gateway to the Kahurangi National Park. There are several shorter tracks accessible from Tapawera but the main attraction in this corner of the park is the Wangapeka Track which crosses to the West Coast south of Karamea. Access to the track is via the Tadmor-Bushend Road and on to the Wangapeka valley. At the junction of the Wangapeka and Dart rivers there is a concrete ford (which needs care) over the Dart River. After seven kilometres there is the Siberia Flat campsite and the Wangapeka Track starts 1 km further on, at the Rolling River carpark.

Shedwood Bush Conservation Area: This area of native bush along the eastern edge of the village offers walks and a scenic lookout.

The Hidden Sculpture Garden is 5 km from town towards Kohatu.

== Cycle Tourism ==

Tapawera is part of cycle trails.

Tapawera is located along Tasman’s Great Taste Trail. The trail starts in Nelson and takes cyclists to Richmond, Brightwater, Wakefield, and through the 1.4 km-long Spooners Tunnel to Kohatu. The trail from Kohatu to Tapawera is off-road except for one short section on road. From Tapawera cyclists can now journey on a picturesque route up Tapawera-Baton Road, which further up the valley follows the Wangapeka River. The gravel road then takes cyclists over a saddle to the Baton River. A swingbridge over the Baton was opened in April 2022. After crossing the river the trail follows the Baton Valley Road to the Baton Bridge at Woodstock. There is work still to be done on the next section but cyclists follow the Motueka West Bank Road to Riwaka.

The gravel road sections on this part of the trail call for caution, especially further up the Tapawera-Baton Road, as they can be busier than some people expect including with heavy vehicles. Dust is also an issue.

The township is also the starting point of the Tapawera to Murchison Heartland Ride which travels up the Tadmor Valley to Glenhope and then on to Murchison via Lake Rotoroa.

Tapawera is also on the route for the Tour Aotearoa brevet which is now held annually. This event travels the length of the country and in Tasman follows the Great Taste Trail to Tapawera and then the route of the Tapawera to Murchison Heartland ride.

<doc id="1128090" wikidata="Q184576" url="?curid=1128090" title="Animal worship">
<text>Animal worship (also zoolatry or theriolatry) is an umbrella term designating religious or ritual practices involving animals. This includes the worship of animal deities or animal sacrifice. An animal &#x27;cult&#x27; is formed when a species is taken to represent a religious figure. Animal cults can be classified according to their formal features or by their symbolic content.

The classical author Diodorus situated the origin of animal worship in a myth in which the gods, threatened by giants, disguised themselves as animals. The people then began to worship these animals and continued even after the gods returned to their normal state. In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from humans&#x27; fascination with the natural world. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability would engender curiosity. Wonder resulted from primitive man&#x27;s observations of this distinctive trait. As such, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits. Lubbock proposed that animal worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal. The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in dietary laws prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are unclean.

The idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by Abrahamic religions. Sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians were accused of animal worship. In Independent Assemblies of God and Pentecostal churches, animals have very little religious significance. Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread.

The Egyptian pantheon was especially fond of zoomorphism, with many animals sacred to particular deities—cats to Bastet, ibises and baboons to Thoth, crocodiles to Sobek and Ra, fish to Set, mongoose, shrew and birds to Horus, dogs and jackals to Anubis, serpents and eels to Atum, beetles to Khepera, bulls to Apis. Animals were often mummified as a result of these beliefs. In Wicca, the Horned God represents an animal-human deity.

==Hunting cults==
===Bear===

There is evidence that connects the Greek goddess Artemis with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as &quot;bears&quot; in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony. According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a nymph into a bear and then into the constellation Ursa Major.

The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings. Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement is believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era.
The Ainu people, who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear &quot;kamui&quot; in their language, which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods. For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term &quot;kamui&quot; is used, it essentially means a bear. The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit.

===Whale===

Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe. Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.

A prevalent whale cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people. Buddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha is reborn as a whale. Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother&#x27;s womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being. For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area.

In Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes to whales after they are captured in a hunt. Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler&#x27;s house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival. The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale&#x27;s soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea.

In China, &quot;Yu-kiang&quot;, a whale with the hands and feet of a man, was said to rule the ocean.

In the Tyrol region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale.

Paikea (also Maori name for humpback whales), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of Mangaia, in the present day Cook Islands, was said by the Kati Kuri people of Kaikōura to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of the whale &quot;Tohora&quot; (Māori name for southern right whales) many centuries before.

The whale features in Inuit creation myths. When &#x27;Big Raven&#x27;, a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return the order to the world.

The Tlingit people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water.

In Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.

In East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility.

Some cultures that associate divinity with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese (also known as Cá Ông), coastal Chinese except for southernmost region, Japanese (also known as Ebisu), occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam&#x27;s ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. See also the below-mentioned Ebisu in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for Ryūgū-jō as well.

Indigenous Ainu tribes on Hokkaido revered killer whales as &quot;Repun Kamuy&quot;, &quot;God of Sea/Offshore&quot; in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people.

==Domesticated mammals==
===Cattle and buffalo===

Many religions have considered cattle to be sacred, most famously Hinduism from India and Nepal, but also Zoroastrianism, and ancient Greek and Egyptian religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function.

The Toda of southern India abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males. The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.

The Ancient Egyptians worshipped a great number of deities who were either depicted entirely as cattle, or incorporated cattle features in their appearance. Hesat, a goddess of milk and motherhood, was depicted as a full cow, as was Mehet-weret, a sky goddess, identified as the Celestial Cow whose body made up the sky, and whose four legs marked the four cardinal directions. Bat (goddess), a goddess of music and dance, was depicted as a woman with bovine ears and horns, as was Hathor, a very major goddess who borrowed a lot of her attributes from Bat. The great antiquity of the worship of Bat is evidenced by her appearance on the Narmer Palette, made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs. When identified with the Celestial Cow Mehet-weret, the sky goddess Nut may also take the form of a cow, as in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. When acting in her role as a heavenly goddess, the mother goddess Isis may also be shown with bovine horns, adopting the traditional headdress of Hathor.

As well as these female cow goddesses, the Egyptians also had a number of male bull gods. Conspicuous among these was the bull god Apis, who was embodied in a living bull kept at the Temple of Ptah at Memphis. Regarded as Ptah&#x27;s herald, the Apis bull was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old bull died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months&#x27; education at Nilopolis. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After its death, it was mummified and buried in a rock tomb. A similar practice was in place at Heliopolis with the Mnevis bull, the herald of Ra, and at Hermonthis with the Buchis bull, the herald of Montu. After their death, all these sacred bulls were considered to become part of Osiris.

Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper Nile. The Nuba and Nuer revere cattle. The Angoni of Central Africa and the Sakalava of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In India respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic.

While there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow. The humped zebu, a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism. Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India. Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and cow heaven by the God, Brahma and Prithu, the sovereign of the universe, who created the earth&#x27;s vegetation, edible fruits, and vegetables, disguised as a cow.

According to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow have led to a misunderstanding that Hindi has a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices. Margul suggests that the sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in the purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine).

===Sheep===
The Ancient Egyptians worshipped several gods with the head of a ram, including Khnum, Heryshaf, Banebdjedet, Ra (sometimes) and Kherty. Amun, the god of Thebes, Egypt, was also associated with the ram, and in later periods was sometimes represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol.

===Goat===
Silenus, the Satyrs, and the Fauns were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, Leszi, is believed to have a goat&#x27;s horns, ears and legs. A deity known as the Goat of Mendes is associated with the pentagram.

In Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form. This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat&#x27;s increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females. The Greek god Pan was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era. To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive. The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages.

Excavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show the religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area. These findings have been used as evidence for a goat cult in Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages.

===Dog===

Dogs have a major religious significance among the Hindus in Nepal and some parts of India. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day Tihar festival that falls roughly in November every year. In Hinduism, it is believed that the dog is a messenger of &quot;Yama&quot;, the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of Heaven. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven&#x27;s doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the lunar cycle in November as Kukur-tihar, as known in the Nepali language for the dog&#x27;s day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying &quot;tika&quot; (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks, and garlanded generally with marigold flower.

Actual dog worship is uncommon. The Nosarii of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The Karang of Java had a cult of the red dog, with each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority, the dogs are images of wood that are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In Nepal it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the Harranians dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae.

===Horse===

 Horse worship has been practiced by a number of Indo-European and Turkic peoples. In the nomadic tradition, the horse is one of the mythological animals, embodying the connection with the other world, with the supernatural. The horse, exceptionally white, has always been associated with the sun, with daytime clarity, with fire, air, sky, water, and solar heroes, as an expression of good human aspirations in daily work and struggle against difficulties. The white sun horse is an attribute of divine forces that are constantly fighting against evil — an opposition to death.

In the beliefs and rites of the nomads, first, the horse itself, second, its separate parts — the skull, cervical vertebrae, skin, hair, and third, objects associated with it — bridle, clamp, sweat, reins, whip, fallen horseshoe, image, etc., act as the patroness and protector of people. The horse is seen to have the ability to drive out evil forces from the human body.

A bronze top with the image of a horse was found in the Ferghana Valley in the early twentieth century, the only one found so far in the Eurasian steppes. It was dated to the period between 4th and 1st century BC and was claimed to have been used in rituals dedicated to the cult of Heavenly Horses.

There is some reason to believe that Poseidon, like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a horse. In the cave of Phigalia Demeter was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized corn-spirit bore this form. Her priests were called Poloi (Greek for &quot;colts&quot;) in Laconia. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god Consus. In Gaul we find a horse-goddess, Epona. There are also traces of a horse god, Rudiobus. Hayagriva is a horse-headed deity that appears in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Gonds in India worship a horse god, Koda Pen, in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn spirit in Europe.

Among the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth. Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse. When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success. Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people.

Horses are godlike beings to Romani people.

===Elephant===

In Thailand it is believed that a white elephant may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal is brought to the king to be kept ever afterward. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indochina, the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In Cambodia it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at Ennarea in southern Ethiopia. In India, the popular Hindu god Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.

In Surat, unmarried Anāvil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alunām. This holiday is to honor the goddess Pārvatī. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate Pārvatī&#x27;s creation of Ganesha from a paste of either turmeric or sandalwood. Every day, unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alunām, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water.

Certain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal&#x27;s importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in Sumatra. Stone elephant figurines were built as &quot;seats of the souls&quot; in the Sumatran culture. In North Borneo, however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads.

==Wild mammals==

===Hare===
In North America, the Algonquian tribes had as their chief deity a &quot;mighty great hare&quot; to whom they went to death. According to one account, he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as Menabosho or Michabo.

The Ancient Egyptians also worshipped a hare goddess, named Wenut. She was associated with the city of Hermopolis, and her image appears on the standard of the Hermopolitan nome.

===Deer===
The deer is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess Artemis, while in Hinduism it is linked to the goddess Saraswati. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the Eurasian Steppe. The golden stag figurine found in the Pazyryk burials is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.

===Wolf===
In the story of Rome&#x27;s foundation, wolves are used in totemic imagery. The founding brothers Romulus and Remus are raised by a mother wolf, making the wolf the symbolic mother of Rome.

Among the Ancient Egyptians, the gods Anubis and Wepwawet both took the form of a wolf, jackal or wild dog, or a man with the head of such a creature. Anubis was a funerary deity, considered the patron of the mummification process and a protector of tombs. In the afterlife, it was he who performed the crucial role in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony that decided the individual&#x27;s post-mortem fate. In earlier times Anubis was the supreme god of the underworld, but he was later replaced in that role by the human-formed Osiris. It is possible that the Egyptians originally conceived of Anubis as a wild dog because of the animal&#x27;s location on the outskirts of towns, near the tombs of the dead, or possibly because of their scavenging of corpses, which led them to congregate near tombs. Wepwawet was a deity more focussed on the world of the living, whose chief role was to &#x27;open the way&#x27;, whether this is opening the way of the pharaoh to victory in battle, opening the way for the priests in a ritual procession, or any other application. The great antiquity of Wepwawet&#x27;s worship in Egypt is evidenced by the Narmer Palette, made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs, including the image of a wolf on a standard as a part of a ritual procession. It has been suggested that Wepwawet&#x27;s depiction as a wolf stems from the animal&#x27;s keen sense of smell, allowing it to &#x27;open the way&#x27; to find something important.

=== Fox ===
Fox deities appear in Chinese and Japanese mythologies and folklores, and are worshipped as spirits in shrines, such as the Inari shrines.

In Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese folklores, foxes (&quot;huli jing&quot; in China, &quot;kitsune&quot; in Japan, &quot;kumiho&quot; in Korea, and &quot;hồ ly tinh&quot; in Vietnam) are powerful spirits that are known for their highly mischievous and cunning nature, and they often take on the form of female humans to seduce men. In contemporary Chinese, the word &quot;huli jing&quot; is often used to describe a mistress negatively in an extramarital affair. In Shinto of Japan, kitsune sometimes help people as an errand of their deity, Inari.

Popular fox worship during the Tang dynasty has been mentioned in a text entitled &quot;Hu Shen&quot; (Fox gods): 
The fox cult survived in northern China in the 20th century, but was suppressed during the anti-superstition Socialist Education Campaign.

=== Big cats ===

The cult of the leopard is widely found in West Africa. Among the Ashanti people a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast, a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried around the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In Loango a prince&#x27;s cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour.

In Ancient Egypt, there were several feline-shaped deities. The earliest attested of these was the goddess Mafdet. During the First Dynasty 2920–2770 BC, Mafdet was regarded as the protector of the Pharaoh&#x27;s chambers against snakes, scorpions and other evil. She was often depicted with the head of a cheetah, leopard or lynx. In later periods, other feline deities were more dominant. There were several lion-headed deities, included goddesses such as Sekhmet, Tefnut, Bastet (early form), Pakhet, Mehit and Menhit, and gods such as Maahes. All of these were fierce deities, dedicated to destroying the enemies of the gods and the pharaoh. Sekhmet, the most famous Egyptian lion-goddess, was considered a daughter of the chief god Ra and was worshipped as a beneficent goddess who protected Egypt from pestilence and misfortune, though at the same time was greatly feared due to her destructive capabilities, as demonstrated in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. Bastet, formerly called Bast, was originally worshipped as a fierce lioness, though in later times was &#x27;tamed&#x27; and worshipped as a gentler domestic cat. During the Late Period of ancient Egypt from 664 BC until the 4th century AD, the practice of mummifying small cats in Bastet&#x27;s honour grew in popularity. Cat mummies were used as votive offerings to the goddess, mostly during festivals and by pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands of cat mummies were excavated at cat cemeteries in Bubastis, Saqqara, Speos Artemidos and Gizeh.

There was a lion god at Baalbek. The pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped the lion god Yaghuth. In modern Africa there is a lion-idol among the Balondo. The lion was also sacred to Hebat, the mother goddess of the Hurrians.

In Judaism the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, a &quot;Young Lion&quot; (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the Lion of Judah started to be reverenced in some other Abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, such as Jesus and Haile Selassie I, the &quot;ras&quot; Tafari.

In Mesoamerica the jaguar was revered as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the Aztec, Maya and Olmec, and had an important role in shamanism.

Of great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the tiger has been considered a major symbol of masculine yang energy since the earliest surviving records of Chinese history. In modern China, it is thought to represent nobility, fearlessness, and wrath and to be the king of the animals, with stripes over its forehead frequently redrawn to form the character for king (). The tiger was originally paired and contrasted with the dragon in Chinese myth, literature, art, and martial arts to represent the yin-yang as well as the dualities of earth and water, west and east, matter and spirit, although by the late imperial era the dragon was instead taken to represent yang and paired with the phoenix as the symbol of feminine yin instead. The White Tiger is one of the four cardinal symbols of Chinese astrology and traditional astronomy, representing autumn and the west and an important figure in Taoism and Chinese folk religion. Separately, the Year of the Tiger is the 3rd year of the duodecennial Chinese zodiac, based on the stars in opposition to the Jovian cycle.

Tigers were either worshipped directly or used as a symbols of aspects of the divine in Shu and other ancient Chinese states, as well as the Black Pottery culture and among the Tungus. The Han sometimes depicted Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West, with the tail of a tiger and once wore stone representations of tigers as protective amulets. Even today, some celebrants of the Dragon Boat Festival paint the character on children&#x27;s foreheads with arsenic realgar as a protective ward against snakebite and other summer ailments. Some tiger worship still occurs, primarily as a form of minority cultural tourism. The Solar Calendar Square is a tourist site in Kunming, Yunnan, related to the traditional religion of the Yi people which held that a tiger was responsible for the creation of the world. It includes a growling tiger statue high. A similar attraction with an Yi tiger totem is located in Chuxiong, Yunnan. The towns of Shuangbai County in Chuxiong Prefecture preserve a traditional dance that originated in rituals related to tiger worship. Continued worship of tigers also occurs in Manchurian folk religion.

In Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power. It appears not only in the Korean foundation mythology but also in folklore, as well as being a favorite subject of Korean art. For example, the 19th-century painting named &quot;Sansindo&quot; () depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do errands for the mountain&#x27;s guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built on the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called &quot;Sansintaenghwa&quot; (산신탱화, 山神幀畵), it is a depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.

In many parts of Vietnam, the tiger is a revered creature with many villages having a tiger temple. This Vietnamese folk religion might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in ancient times. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity, and grace. The tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are also seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.

The tiger is associated with the Hindu deities Shiva and Durga. In Pokhara, Nepal, the tiger festival is known as Bagh Jatra. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and are &quot;hunted&quot;. The Warli of western India worship the tiger-like god Waghoba. The Warli believe that shrines and sacrifices to the deity will lead to better coexistence with the local big cats, both tigers and leopards, and that Waghoba will protect them when they enter the forests.

===Monkey===
In Hinduism, the monkey deity, Hanuman, is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm.

Chinese religions and mythologies give monkeys and apes cultural significance as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, Sun Wukong or &quot;Monkey King&quot; is the main protagonist in Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s picaresque novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. In traditional Chinese folk religion, monkeys are supernatural beings that could shape shift into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In Daoism, monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a &quot;xian&quot; &quot;transcendent; immortal&quot;, and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing &quot;qi&quot; &quot;breath; life force&quot; through the Daoist discipline of &quot;daoyin&quot; &quot;guiding and pulling&quot;. Similar to Daoism, Chinese Buddhism paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the &quot;Jataka tales&quot; say that Gautama Buddha was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the Chan Buddhist &quot;mind monkey&quot; metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.

Monkeys are said to be worshipped in Togo. At Porto Novo, in Benin, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys.

The hamadryas baboon was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians and often appeared as a form of a deity. Egyptian deities depicted as baboons include Hapi (Son of Horus), Babi (mythology) and Thoth, although the latter is more often shown with the head of an ibis. A group of 6 or 8 baboons was also a common feature in scenes depicting the sun god at dawn as he rose over the horizon, with the baboons raising their hands to him in praise. This is probably inspired by the observed behaviour of baboons, as they are known to &#x27;chatter&#x27; at sunrise as if greeting the sun.

===Hippopotamus===

In Ancient Egyptian religion, the hippopotamus had both positive and negative associations. On the one hand, the strong maternal instinct of female hippos led to the worship of several female hippo goddesses, usually as goddesses of pregnancy and motherhood, and protectors of women and children. The most famous of these hippopotamus goddesses is Taweret, a very common household deity among the common people of Egypt, and many amulets were made in her form. Others included Opet or Ipet, who was similar to Taweret but a little more stately, as well as Reret, who personified the constellation of Draco. On the other hand, the destructive capabilities of the hippopotamus towards useful boats led to it also being seen as a force of chaos, and so it also became associated with the god of disorder, Set. Though normally depicted as a man with the head of the mysterious &quot;sha&quot; animal, in scenes of the battles between Seth and Horus, Seth can sometimes be shown in hippopotamus form, with Horus standing on a papyrus raft and spearing him with a harpoon. This victory of Horus over Seth was symbolically re-enacted during royal hunting expeditions, with the king taking the role of Horus, and a wild hippopotamus embodying Seth. The king&#x27;s successful slaughter of the hippopotamus thus connected his martial prowess to that of Horus himself, demonstrating his right to be king.

===Rodent===
In some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.

==Birds==
===Crow/raven===
The Raven is the chief deity of the Tlingit people of Alaska. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a cultural hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on. A raven story from the Puget Sound region describes the &quot;Raven&quot; as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally &quot;bird land&quot;) that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with &quot;bird land&quot; that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.

In the creator role, and in the Raven&#x27;s role as the totem and ancestor of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as &quot;Grandfather Raven&quot;. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a creator Raven who is different from the trickster Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.

Together with the eagle hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern Australia. Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the Celtic and Germanic Religions, where they were connected to Bran and the Morrigan in the former and Woden in the latter.

===Hawk===
North Borneo treated the hawk as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people&#x27;s Supreme God. There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war. In North Borneo we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the Kenyahs, the Kayans, and the sea Dyaks. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk god, Laki Neho, but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, Laki Tenangan. Singalang Burong, the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is the god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger for he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over.

According to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal. This particular bird was &quot;a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes&quot;.

The hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god Horus. As a god of the sky, divine authority, war, victory, and civilisation, Horus became the patron deity of the pharaohs. The souls of former pharaohs were said to be the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk. Horus was originally depicted by the Egyptians as a full hawk, but after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty depictions with a human body and a hawk head became more common. Other Egyptian deities shown in the form of a hawk or hawk-headed man include Qebehsenuef, Sopdu, Ra (not always), and Sokar.

Egypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures that held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice. Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god. Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is primarily regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however, historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.

===Frigatebird===
On Easter Island until the 1860s there was a Tangata manu (Bird man) cult which has left behind paintings and petroglyphs of Birdmen (half men half frigatebirds). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first sooty tern egg of the season from the islet of Moto Iti and take it to Orongo.

The Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete. The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god Make-make, the god of the seabird&#x27;s egg on Easter Island.

===Ibis===
In Ancient Egypt, the ibis was considered sacred as it was viewed as a manifestation of Thoth, a god of the moon and wisdom. In art, Thoth was usually depicted as a man with the head of an ibis, or more rarely as a baboon. Sacred ibises were kept and fed in temples in his honour, and mummified ibises were given to him as votive offerings. It is thought that the association of the ibis with Thoth may have originated from the curved shape of the bird&#x27;s beak, which resembles a crescent moon.

===Vulture===
Another species of bird that was considered sacred in Ancient Egypt was the Egyptian vulture. At the city of Nekheb in Upper Egypt there was a temple dedicated to the goddess Nekhbet, who was depicted in art as a vulture, sometimes wearing a royal crown. Nekhbet was closely associated with the Egyptian royal family and was considered a personal protector of the Egyptian king. She was often portrayed or invoked alongside a similar goddess named Wadjet, who was depicted as a cobra and had her main temple at Buto in Lower Egypt. Nekhbet and Wadjet thus often featured together on temple reliefs and stelae, representing in heraldic format the union between Upper and Lower Egypt. These two goddesses were considered so important that they could be referred to by the simple title &quot;nebty&quot; (&quot;the two ladies&quot;) without any confusion as to their identity. Out of the five names that made up the Ancient Egyptian royal titulary, one of them, the &quot;nebty name&quot; was dedicated to the Two Ladies. This great honour of patronage over one of the king&#x27;s names was shared only with such major gods as Ra and Horus. Egyptologists have theorised that the association of Nekhbet with the vulture may have originated from observations of a mother vulture&#x27;s behaviour as it protects its chicks by &quot;mantling&quot; them with its wings, leading to its association with a protective and maternal goddess. In fact, the Egyptian word &quot;mut&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;) is spelt in hieroglyphs with a picture of a vulture. Due to the vulture&#x27;s maternal connotations and its early use in the iconography of Nekhbet, in later periods a vulture headdress came to be worn by a large number of Egyptian goddesses, as well as by human queens. The goddess Mut, worshipped at Thebes, Egypt alongside Amun and Khonsu, was written in hieroglyphs with a picture of a vulture, and would be indistinguishable from the common noun &quot;mother&quot; except for the fact that in the goddess&#x27;s name the vulture bears a royal flail. Goddesses who wore the vulture headdress in later periods included Mut, Hathor, Isis, and Wadjet, although only Nekhbet appeared as a vulture in its entirety.
In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Jatayu, the &quot;King of Vultures&quot;(&quot;gṛdhrarāja&quot;), fights valiantly with the rakshasa Ravana to prevent him from abducting Sita. However, as Jatayu was very old, Ravana soon defeated him, clipping his wings, and Jatayu descended upon the earth. Rama and Lakshmana, while searching for Sita, chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the battle with Ravana, and told them that Ravana had headed south. Jatayu then died of his wounds and Rama performed his final funeral rites. Jatayu&#x27;s elder brother Sampati later helps Rama and Lakshmana find Sita. 

Jatayu is worshipped at the Vijayaraghava Perumal temple (Thiruputkuli, Tamil Nadu), which is believed to be the site where he fell.

==Other non-mammals==
===Serpents===

The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the Old World, and in the Americas.

In India snake worship refers to the high status of snakes in Hindu mythology. Over a large part of India, there are carved representations of cobras (nagas) or stones as substitutes. To these people, food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra that is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent god&#x27;s image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess.

At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja, known as the &quot;king of the serpents&quot; was worshipped. Instead of the &quot;king of the serpents,&quot; actual live snakes were worshipped in South India. The Manasa cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, Manasa.

In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey. But the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah, the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the &quot;danh-gbi&quot; kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. &quot;Danh-gbi&quot; has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried around the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. But only specific individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa, the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.

In Ancient Egyptian religion, serpents had both positive and negative representations. On the one hand, the Egyptians worshipped several beneficent snake deities, including Wadjet, Renenutet, Meretseger, Nehebkau and Mehen. The uraeus was a fierce divine cobra that protected Egyptian kings and major deities. On the other hand, the serpent Apophis was a malevolent demon, who endeavoured to destroy the chief deity Ra.

The Sumerians had a serpent god Ningizzida.

===Other reptiles===

As well as the serpent, the Nile crocodile was another important reptile in Ancient Egyptian religion. Several deities were depicted in crocodilian form, but the most famous and important of these was undoubtedly the god Sobek. Sobek was a powerful and fearsome god, associated with violence and strength, and acted as a fierce protector against evil, and a punisher of wrongdoers. It is easy to see why he was associated with the crocodile, which similarly is a very fearsome creature. Sobek also had a role relating to fertility, particularly the fertility brought to the land by the Nile flood, in whose waters crocodiles live. Sobek&#x27;s main temple was located in the city of Crocodilopolis in the Fayyum area, and he also had the important Temple of Kom Ombo, which he shared with the god Horus. Sobek was also worshipped as a secondary deity in the temples of other gods, particularly those of his mother, the goddess Neith. Other Egyptian crocodile gods include Shemanefer, the lesser-known brother of Sobek, as well as Khenty-Khety and Wenty, about whom little is known.

===Fish===

According to the Jewish scholar Rashi, the Canaanite god Dagon was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered reliefs suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins.

In Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries. Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock. The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada.

During Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails. Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day. Large marine megafaunas such as whales and whale sharks (also called &quot;Ebisu-shark&quot;) were often referred to as Ebisu himself to bring a mass of fish among them and as guardians of fishermen.

The Ancient Egyptian goddess Hatmehit from the city of Mendes was depicted as a fish, fish-woman hybrid, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head. She was a goddess of life and protection. Fish, specifically Nile perch, were also held sacred to the Egyptian goddess Neith at her temple at Esna, though she was never depicted in their form.

===Amphibians===

The Ancient Egyptians worshipped a goddess in the form of a frog, named Heqet. She was a goddess of fertility, both the fertility of the land and the fertility of human reproduction. She was particularly associated with the final stages of the Nile flood, as well as the final stages of human birth. She was portrayed as a divine midwife and was considered the consort of the god Khnum due to their similar roles.

===Insects===

The dung beetle, or scarab, was an important symbol in Ancient Egyptian religion. The behaviour of the beetle rolling its ball of dung along the ground was likened to the sun god rolling the sun across the sky. As a result, the beetle god Khepri received worship in the city of Heliopolis, the main sanctuary of the sun god Ra. In addition, the birth of young beetles from eggs laid in dung was an important symbol of rebirth, so amulets in the shape of scarabs were often included in tombs.

Another insect (technically, an arachnid) venerated by the Egyptians was the scorpion. The goddess Serqet was depicted wearing a scorpion on her headdress, and was prayed to in order to heal venomous stings and bites. She was one of a group of four goddesses frequently invoked together to protect the body in funerary customs, the others being Isis, Nephthys, and Neith. The four were often charged with protecting particular organs, assisting the Four Sons of Horus. Though less famous than the other three canopic goddesses, Serqet&#x27;s worship is clearly very ancient, with images of scorpions appearing very early in Egyptian art, and even appearing in the names of several early kings. Though the association of Serqet with the scorpion has long been assumed her original function, recent scholarship has questioned whether the original animal in her headdress may have actually been a water scorpion and whether the association with the land scorpion came later. As well as Serqet, there were several more minor scorpion goddesses, including Hededet and Ta-Bitjet. A group of seven scorpions also appear as protectors of Isis in the myth of her raising her son Horus.

==Oracular animals==
Animals are frequently used for the purposes of divination.

Birds are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. Augury was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in Classical Antiquity. The dove appears as an oracular animal in the story of Noah, and also in Thisbe in Boeotia there was a dove-oracle of Zeus. Animal imagery was also often employed in the oracular utterances in Ancient Greece. Parrot astrology is a form of divination using green parakeets which originated in South India and is still practiced in modern times.

In Chinese and Japanese folk religion, the tortoise is an oracular animal. Tortoise shells were used by ancient Chinese as oracle bones to make predictions.

A popular North American tradition is Groundhog Day, in which on February 2 each year a groundhog is used to predict whether there will be an early spring.

Notable oracular animals of the modern period include Lady Wonder, Punxsutawney Phil, Maggie the Monkey, Lazdeika the Crab, Paul the Octopus, and Sonny Wool.

==Shamanism and animals==

Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as &quot;assistant spirits,&quot; &quot;guardian spirits,&quot; and &quot;helping spirits,&quot; animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman&#x27;s work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman. When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman&#x27;s efforts.

An example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time. His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman&#x27;s essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body. He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient&#x27;s soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat.

In the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman&#x27;s essence into an animal spirit is referred to as &quot;becoming an animal&quot;. The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth&#x27;s outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture. Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth. Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines. When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success. Animals were a central part of this religion.

==Religious and cultural representation of animals==
===Buddhism===

One of the most important sanctions of the Buddhist faith is the concept of ahimsa, or refraining from the destruction of life. According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures. Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger. The Dalai Lama once said &quot;Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?&quot;. Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a vegetarian diet to avoid causing pain to animals.

Avoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist&#x27;s diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist monks do not travel during rainy seasons. Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys.

Living creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life forms are interrelated. There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A jataka, or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering so that she could feed his flesh to them.

===Hinduism===

Hinduism is one of the six primary religions of India. Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from Vedic times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later Buddhist and Jain-influenced eras that led to a wider concept adoption of non-violence or ahimsa and respect for animals, as a major constituent in Dharmic belief systems. Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves re-incarnate as animals based on their deeds or karma. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family.

There are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on special occasions and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness , animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in &quot;some&quot; parts of India. An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal.

===Inca Empire===

The Inca Empire, the most well-known indigenous group of people in South America, had a strong religious relationship with animals in their environment, believing that they were the gods presenting themselves to the Incas. This was reflected in the form of ceramics such as Huaco and in metalwork such as the &quot;Inca Silver Alpaca&quot;.

One Incan animal god is the Urcuchillay, who was worshipped by herders. He was believed to take the shape of a multi-colored llama who watched over the livestock. Urcuchillay was believed to be essential for the health of the herd, the resources from the herd, and the health of the next generation of the herd. Pariacaca (Paryaqaqa), the Incan god of water and rainstorms, was believed to have been born a falcon but later became human. The Incas believed if they upset this god, he would bring floods. Little is known about Pariacaca. Mama Cocha, (Cochamama) or the Mother of the Ocean, is the Incan goddess of the sea and sea animals. She was heavily worshipped by sailors and fishermen who wanted to ensure a great supply of fish and sought her help in navigating the storms and calming the seas. She was believed to be the mother of Inti (Sun God) and Mama Killa (Goddess of the Moon).

===Jainism===

Mahavira, the 24th Teerthankar of Jainism, believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow ahimsa and not harm any living creature. Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion to worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves. Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours when their vision is not restricted so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food.

Jainism includes a lay form that is somewhat less restrictive. Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely. This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts).

Food will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures.

Lay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does.

<text>The MOBILIVRE-BOOKMOBILE project is a community arts initiative founded by the Bookmobile collective, a diverse group of emerging North American artists and community activists. Their mandate is to fuse artistic production with political activism and community organizing. The collective consists of a fluctuating group of dedicated volunteers, coordinators, jury organizers, and tour guides. Although the project is based primarily in Montreal, QC, and Philadelphia, PA, collective members reside in various cities throughout North America.

The MOBILIVRE-BOOKMOBILE project explores the long-held tradition of bookmobiles as traveling libraries in order to promote the distribution of information. Since 2000, the project has been selectively collecting and organizing artist&#x27;s books (that range from handmade and one-of-a-kind pieces, to zines, photocopied works, and other independent publications) on an annual basis. Members of the collective present these works to the public in a series of traveling exhibitions that are held throughout the United States and Canada with the help of a vintage Airstream trailer. The artist collective also organizes workshops and participates in educational activities on a community level during these tours. 

Each touring collection consists of about 300 items. In 2005, the collective donated its 2000-2005 collections to Artexte Information Centre. This not-for-profit arts organization maintains the collections and provides on-site access to them. Artexte also provides further access to these collections with an electronic guide to individual works, organized by touring year: Projet MOBILIVRE-BOOKMOBILE Project Guide

<text>A bookmobile, or mobile library, is a vehicle designed for use as a library. They have been known by many names throughout history, including traveling library, library wagon, book wagon, book truck, library-on-wheels, and book auto service. Bookmobiles expand the reach of traditional libraries by transporting books to potential readers, providing library services to people in otherwise underserved locations (such as remote areas) and/or circumstances (such as residents of retirement homes). Bookmobile services and materials (such as Internet access, large print books, and audiobooks), may be customized for the locations and populations served.

Bookmobiles have been based on various means of conveyance, including bicycles, carts, motor vehicles, trains, watercraft, and wagons, as well as camels, donkeys, elephants, horses, and mules.

==History==
===19th century===

In the United States of America, The American School Library (1839) was a traveling frontier library published by Harper &amp; Brothers. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History has the only complete original set of this series complete with its wooden carrying case.

&quot;The British Workman&quot; reported in 1857 about a perambulating library operating in a circle of eight villages, in Cumbria. A Victorian merchant and philanthropist, George Moore, had created the project to &quot;diffuse good literature among the rural population&quot;.

The Warrington Perambulating Library, set up in 1858, was another early British mobile library. This horse-drawn van was operated by the Warrington Mechanics&#x27; Institute, which aimed to increase the lending of its books to enthusiastic local patrons.

During the late 1800s, women&#x27;s clubs began advocating for bookmobiles in the state of Texas and throughout the United States. Kate Rotan of the women&#x27;s club in Waco, Texas, was the first to advocate for bookmobiles. She was president of the Texas Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (TFWC). During this time, women&#x27;s clubs were encouraged to promote bookmobiles because they embraced their ideas and missions. After receiving so much support and promotion, these traveling libraries increased in numbers all around the United States. In the state of New York from 1895 to 1898 the number of bookmobiles increased to 980. The United States Women Clubs became their primary advocate.

===20th century===
The Women&#x27;s Club movement in 1904, had the standard to be held accountable for the influx of bookmobiles in thirty out of fifty states. Because of the Texas Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (TFWC), a new legislation to develop public libraries in Texas became possible after much advocating from TFWC for bookmobiles. This new legislation brought in library improvements and expansions that included establishing a system of traveling libraries in Texas. Women&#x27;s Clubs wanted state governments to step in and create commissions for these traveling libraries. They hoped the commissions would boost the managers of the bookmobile&#x27;s &quot;Library Sprit&quot;. Unfortunately, the Texas Library Association (TLA) could not provide the type of service that is already provided to state libraries to bookmobiles.
One of the earliest mobile libraries in the United States was a mule-drawn wagon carrying wooden boxes of books. It was created in 1904 by the People&#x27;s Free Library of Chester County, South Carolina, and served the rural areas there.

Another early mobile library service was developed by Mary Lemist Titcomb (1857–1932). As a librarian in Washington County, Maryland, Titcomb was concerned that the library was not reaching all the people it could. Meant as a way to reach more library patrons, the annual report for 1902 listed 23 deposit stations, with each being a collection of 50 books in a case that was placed in a store or post office throughout the county. Although popular, Titcomb realized that even this did not reach the most rural residents, and so she cemented the idea of a &quot;book wagon&quot; in 1905, taking the library materials directly to people&#x27;s homes in remote parts of the county. After securing a Carnegie gift of $2,500, Titcomb purchased a black Concord wagon and employed the library janitor to drive it. The book wagon proved popular, with 1,008 volumes distributed within its first six months. 
With the rise of motorized transport in America, a pioneering librarian in 1920 named Sarah Byrd Askew began driving her specially outfitted Model T to provide library books to rural areas in New Jersey. The automobile remained rare, however, and in Minneapolis, the Hennepin County Public Library operated a horse-drawn book wagon starting in 1922.

Following the Great Depression in the United States, a WPA effort from 1935 to 1943 called the Pack Horse Library Project covered the remote coves and mountainsides of Kentucky and nearby Appalachia, bringing books and similar supplies on foot and on hoof to those who could not make the trip to a library on their own. Sometimes these &quot;packhorse librarians&quot; relied on a centralized contact to help them distribute the materials.

At Fairfax County, Virginia, county-wide bookmobile service was begun in 1940, in a truck loaned by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA support of the bookmobile ended in 1942, but the service continued.
The &quot;Library in Action&quot; was a late-1960s bookmobile program in the Bronx, NY, run by interracial staff that brought books to teenagers of color in under-served neighborhoods.

Bookmobiles reached the height of their popularity in the mid-twentieth century.

In England, bookmobiles, or &quot;traveling libraries&quot; as they were called in that country, were typically used in rural and outlying areas. However, during World War II, one traveling library found popularity in the city of London. Because of air raids and blackouts, patrons did not visit the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras&#x27;s physical libraries as much as before the war. To meet the needs of its citizens, the borough borrowed a traveling library van from Hastings and in 1941 created a &quot;war-time library on wheels.&quot; (The Saint Pancras borough was abolished in 1965 and became part of the London Borough of Camden.) 

The Saint Pancras traveling library consisted of a van mounted on a six-wheel chassis powered by a Ford engine. The traveling library could carry more than 2,000 books on open-access shelves that ran the length of the van. The books were arranged in Dewey order, and up to 20 patrons could fit into the van at one time to browse and check out materials. A staff enclosure was at the rear of the van, and the van was lighted with windows in the roof – each fitted with black-out curtains in case of a German bombing raid. The van could even be used at night, as it was fitted with electric roof lamps that could access electrical current from a nearby lamp-standard or civil defense post. The traveling library had a selection of fiction and non-fiction works; it even had a children&#x27;s section with fairy tales and non-fiction books for kids.

The mayor of the borough christened the van with a speech, saying that &quot;People without books are like houses without windows.&quot; Even after heavy night bombings by the Germans, readers visited the Saint Pancras Traveling Library in some of the worst bombed areas.

===21st century===

Bookmobiles are still in use in the 21st century, operated by libraries, schools, activists, and other organizations. Although some feel that the bookmobile is an outmoded service, citing reasons like high costs, advanced technology, impracticality, and ineffectiveness, others cite the ability of the bookmobile to be more cost-efficient than building more branch libraries would be and its high use among its patrons as support for its continuation. To meet the growing demand for &quot;greener&quot; bookmobiles that deliver outreach services to their patrons, some bookmobile manufacturers have introduced significant advances to reduce their carbon footprint, such as solar/battery solutions in lieu of traditional generators, and all-electric and hybrid-electric chassis. Bookmobiles have also taken on an updated form in the form of &quot;m libraries&quot;, also known as &quot;mobile libraries&quot; in which patrons are delivered content electronically.

The Internet Archive runs its own bookmobile to print out-of-copyright books on demand. The project has spun off similar efforts elsewhere in the developing world.

The Free Black Women&#x27;s Library is a mobile library in Brooklyn. Founded by Ola Ronke Akinmowo in 2015, this bookmobile features books written by black women. Titles are available in exchange for other titles written by black female authors.

==National Bookmobile Day==

In the U.S., the American Library Association sponsors National Bookmobile Day in April each year, on the Wednesday of National Library Week. They celebrate the nation&#x27;s bookmobiles and the dedicated library professionals who provide this service to their communities.

In February 2021, the American Library Association (ALA), the Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services (ABOS), and the Association for Rural and Small Libraries (ARSL) agreed to rebrand National Bookmobile Day in recognition of all that outreach library professional do within their communities. Instead, libraries across the country will observe National Library Outreach Day on April 7, 2021. Formerly known as National Bookmobile Day, communities will celebrate the invaluable role library professionals and libraries continuously play in bringing library services to those in need.

<text>Beowa, Beaw, Bēow , Beo or Bedwig is a figure in Anglo-Saxon traditional religion associated with barley and agriculture. The figure is attested in the Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies as they were extended in the age of Alfred, where Beowa is inserted as the son of Scyld and the grandson of Sceafa, in lineages carried back to Adam. Connections have been proposed between the figure of Beowa and the hero Beowulf of the poem of the same name and English folk song figure John Barleycorn.

==Etymology==
&quot;Beoƿ&quot; is an Old English word for barley. In the Anglo-Saxon genealogies, Beoƿa is the son or grandson of Sceafa, the Old English word for . The noun &quot;beoƿ&quot; has an Old Norse parallel in &quot;Bygg&quot;, the word for &quot;grain.&quot; Related comparisons have been made between the figure of Beoƿ and Byggvir, attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; as a servant of the god Freyr.

==Theories==
Some scholars posit a connection between the mythical figure of Beowa and the legendary Beowulf. As the two characters possess many of the same attributes, it has been suggested that &quot;a god Beowa, whose existence in myth is certain, became confused or blended with Beowulf.&quot;

Another possibility is that the (first) scribe responsible for the Beowulf text conflated two names. At the beginning of the poem, there is a character called Beowulf, the son of Scyld Scefing, but this character is not the Beowulf who is the protagonist of the poem. Rather than accepting that there are two different characters with this unusual name, many modern editions of the poem replace this name with &quot;Beow&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien, one of the proponents of reading &quot;Beow&quot; here, suggested that the use of &quot;Beowulf&quot; as Scyld Schefing&#x27;s son was a scribal error for the original &quot;Beow&quot;, noting that the two scribes who produced the Beowulf manuscript were &quot;both extremely ignorant of and careless with proper names&quot;, and called the occurrence of &quot;Beowulf&quot; in this place in the manuscript &quot;one of the oddest facts in Old English literature&quot; and &quot;one of the reddest and highest red herrings that were ever dragged across a literary trail&quot;.

Kathleen Herbert draws a link between Beowa and the figure of John Barleycorn of traditional English folksong. Herbert says that Beowa and Barleycorn are one and the same, noting that the folksong details the suffering, death, and resurrection of Barleycorn, yet also celebrates the &quot;reviving effects of drinking his blood.&quot;

<text>The Door in the Floor is a 2004 American drama film written and directed by Tod Williams. The screenplay is based on the first third of the 1998 novel &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; by John Irving.

==Plot==
Set in an exclusive beach community on Long Island, where children&#x27;s book author and artist Ted Cole lives with his wife Marion and their young daughter Ruth, usually supervised by her nanny Alice. Their walls are covered with photographs of the couple&#x27;s teenage sons, who were killed in an automobile crash, which left Marion deeply depressed and the marriage in a shambles. The one shared experience that holds them together is Ruth&#x27;s ritualistic daily viewing of a home gallery of the deceased sons.
Ted and Marion temporarily separate, each alternately living in the house and in a rented apartment in town. Ted hires Eddie O&#x27;Hare to work as his summer assistant and driver, since his own license was suspended for drunk driving.

An aspiring writer, Eddie admires Ted, but he soon finds the older man to be a self-absorbed womanizer with an erratic work schedule, leaving the young assistant to fill his time as best he can. Eddie and Marion soon get involved, which seems not to bother Ted, who enjoys trysts of his own with local resident Evelyn Vaughn (Mimi Rogers) while sketching her. When Ruth catches Eddie and her mother having sex, Ted becomes upset and advises Eddie he may have to testify about the incident if Ted needs to fight for custody.

Marion eventually leaves Ted and their daughter, taking with her all the photographs and negatives of their dead sons, except for the one being reframed after it was broken, injuring Ruth. Eddie takes the initiative to retrieve the picture so that Ruth can have at least one partial image of her brothers.

Ted tells Eddie the story of the car accident that killed his sons. He suggests his and Marion&#x27;s drunkenness and Ted&#x27;s failure to remove snow from the tail and turn signal lights likely contributed to their sons&#x27; deaths. He gives vivid detail, to help Eddie understand Marion&#x27;s intense despair. Ted does not fully comprehend why Marion left, repeating, &quot;What kind of mother leaves her daughter?&quot;

At the end of the story, while playing squash alone on his court, Ted stops, looks into the camera with resignation, then lifts the door in the floor and descends.

==Cast==
==Production==
In reference to her sex scene with 18-year-old Jon Foster, Kim Basinger said she was concerned because of the actor&#x27;s age. &quot;I&#x27;m so fond of him and protective of him which is just the opposite to most of these situations because usually I&#x27;ve worked with men who are very protective of me. So this was quite the reverse. But Jon was a trooper, just a lovely guy,&quot; Basinger said.

Talking about her full frontal nude scene at 48, Mimi Rogers admitted it was &quot;a little scary,&quot; but once she worked out all the particulars with director Tod Williams, the clothes came right off.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 144 reviews, and an average rating of 6.46/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though uneven in tone, this is one of the better adaptations of John Irving&#x27;s novels, with Jeff Bridges giving one of his best performances.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;surely the best movie yet made from Mr. Irving&#x27;s fiction&quot; and added, &quot;It may even belong in the rarefied company of movies that are better than the books on which they are based . . . If you examine the story closely, you can find soft spots of implausibility and cliché. But the shakiness of some of the film&#x27;s central ideas . . . matters far less than it might . . . &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; nimbly shifts between melodrama and comedy, with a delightful and perfectly executed excursion into high farce near the end, and it seems perpetually to be discovering new possibilities for its characters . . . Mr. Foster and Ms. Basinger are both very good, but the film is dominated by Mr. Bridges&#x27; performance . . . [He] not only dominates the movie, he animates it. He is heroically life-size.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it &quot;extraordinary in every way, from the pitch-perfect performances to the delicate handling of explosive subject matter.&quot; He added, &quot;It&#x27;s bumpy going at times. But Williams is a talent to watch and a wonder with the actors. Basinger&#x27;s haunted beauty burns in the memory – this is her finest work. And Bridges, one of the best actors on the planet, blends the contradictions of Ted . . . into an indelible portrait. You can&#x27;t shut the door on this spellbinder. It gets into your head.&quot;

James Christopher of &quot;The Times&quot; observed, &quot;What&#x27;s strange about the film is that it&#x27;s pitched like a play. There are no obvious ructions yet it bristles with small riddles and puzzling inconsistencies . . . The chemistry is absurd and tragic. Bridges is the obvious pull; Basinger is a one-note trauma. The story is curiously spellbinding, and fabulously ambivalent about their sins.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
Jeff Bridges was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Male but lost to Paul Giamatti for &quot;Sideways&quot;. Tod Williams was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay but lost to Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor for &quot;Sideways&quot;, and was nominated for the Golden Shell at the San Sebastian Film Festival but lost to Bahman Ghobadi for &quot;Turtles Can Fly&quot;. The film received the National Board of Review Award for Excellence In Filmmaking.

<text>Tasmania Police is the primary law enforcement agency of the Australian state of Tasmania. Established in 1899, the force has more than 1,300 officers policing Tasmania&#x27;s population of 571,200 people.

==History==

===Colonial history===
Prior to the formation of a unified police force, the colony of Tasmania (then called Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) was policed from 1803 under the administration of Lieutenant Governor David Collins by a small number of superintendents and overseers, and from 1804 by a civilian body known as the &quot;Night Watch&quot;, brought by Collins from Port Phillip Bay. The Night Watch was disbanded in 1806 due to ineffectiveness and was replaced by British military patrols. A municipal police force was established at Port Dalrymple (Launceston) on 19 November 1804, with Thomas Massey as Chief Constable.

===Formation===

With the introduction of the &quot;Police Regulation Act 1898&quot;, one unified police force was established which came into being on 1 January 1899. George Richardson was appointed the first Commissioner of the new force, and he quickly implemented several structural changes to the existing municipal policing areas, amalgamating them into 14 districts between a total of 246 police members. The early police officers were to undertake a wide variety of tasks from compiling the electoral roll in 1903, to tracking missing rifles from the Tasmanian contingent to the Second Boer War. Richardson complained frequently about the workload placed upon his officers, until a Royal Commission in 1905 recommended his replacement. William Hunt was appointed as Richardson&#x27;s replacement but died before he could take office, and Colonel John Lord took his place, serving as Commissioner for 16 years with a break to serve with the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I.

===Modernisation and present day===

The &quot;Police Act 1905&quot; defined and expanded the powers of Tasmania Police, which included liquor and lodging licensing, dog registration, vehicle regulation and disorderly conduct. In October 1917, the force appointed its first female police officer, Kate Campbell, and in 1918 two women were added to police staff primarily to police child protection laws. As of 30 June 2020, around 34 per cent of Tasmania Police officers were female.

By 1922, Tasmania Police had 235 police officers.

In 2004 the &quot;Police Regulation Act 1898&quot; was finally repealed and the new was proclaimed. The new Act retained a number of features of the old Act but the most controversial change was that of the powers of the Commissioner, including powers to test police officers for drugs and alcohol, integrity testing and the power to seek details of an officer&#x27;s financial position. The powers of the Commissioner may, generally speaking, only be used if there is some sort of suspicion attached to an individual police officer.

==Structure==
Tasmania Police is part of the Tasmanian Government&#x27;s Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, which also consists of the State Emergency Service, Forensic Science Service Tasmania and the Tasmania Fire Service.

The Commissioner of Police also serves as the secretary of the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, and the State Emergency Management Controller.

===Jurisdiction===
The force is divided into three geographical district commands: Southern, Northern and Western. Each district is divided into several geographical divisions, and is administered by a Commander. There are 67 police stations across the state, ranging from state-of-the-art urban facilities to regional and remote police houses in the state&#x27;s highlands, and on King Island and Flinders Island.

===Support commands===
Tasmania Police comprises four support commands which support the geographical districts:
* Education and Training
* Operations Support (incorporating Firearms Services, Forensic Services, Investigative and Intelligence Support Services, Marine and Rescue Services, Radio Dispatch Services, Safe Families Coordination Unit, Serious Organised Crime Division, State Community Policing)
* Professional Standards
* Special Response and Counter-Terrorism (incorporating Policy Development, Emergency and Risk Management, Special Operations Group, Protective Security)

==Rank structure==
Tasmania Police has a similar rank structure to other policing agencies in Australia.

===Commissioners===
The following police officers have been promoted in rank and appointed to serve as the commissioner of Tasmania Police:

==Tasmania Police Academy==
The Tasmania Police Academy is located in the suburb of Rokeby on Hobart&#x27;s Eastern Shore.

Local training of police officers in Tasmania began in 1958 at Sackville Street in Hobart. In 1960, Commissioner Delderfield suggested the establishment of a police training college on Hobart&#x27;s eastern shore, and the idea was discussed until Commissioner Phil Fletcher managed to get the proposal approved by cabinet on 16 December 1969. Several sites were considered until Rokeby was selected.

The main road into the Tasmania Police Academy, Phil Fletcher Drive, was named in his honour.

The Academy was officially opened on 6 March 1976 by the Premier of Tasmania, Bill Neilson. The Tasmania Police Academy was the first purpose-built Police Academy in Australia.

The Tasmania Police Academy offers training for Tasmania Police recruits, currently serving Tasmania Police officers, and is offered as a community resource to various local community groups.

==Equipment==

===Firearms===
The general-issue Glock 17 9-mm semi-automatic pistol retains the &quot;three-tier&quot; safety features of the original model, and does not include any special features specific to Tasmania Police. Contrary to popular belief, there was never a Glock model specifically developed for use that was unique to Tasmania Police. Tasmania Police underwent a period of individual issue of the weapon until the adoption of the Glock 17 as the standard-issue weapon in 1999. The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolver is no longer issued or carried by Tasmania Police.

The Glock 19 compact pistol has been issued mainly to traffic sections, and the Glock 26 sub-compact model was adopted as the general-issue sidearm for detectives and covert units. A degree of individual preference of model adopted by the individual officer exists to this day.

===Operational equipment===
In addition to firearms, police are also equipped with an expandable baton and OC spray. In April 2015, the Multiuse Integrated Protection Vest (MIPV) was issued, a combination of a load bearing vest and a Ballistic vest, with a high visibility over garment, together with a new uniform.

Tasmania Police evaluated the use of taser stun guns in 2009, but the decision was made not to issue tasers to front-line officers. Currently, only officers of the Special Operations Group and the emergency response team at Risdon Prison Complex are authorised to carry tasers.

In August 2018, Tasmania Police began the rollout of body worn cameras to frontline officers, as part of a $3.4 million program to deploy them across the whole force over four years.

===Vehicles===

The first radio-equipped vehicles adopted by Tasmania Police were FX Holden sedans, with ten of these acquired in 1950. Ford Fairlane cars were adopted in 1960 for use by the Criminal Investigative Branch, and over the years various makes of Holden, Ford and Toyota have been used. Notably the Traffic division adopted Nissan Skyline Silhouette pursuit cars in the late 1980s.

Tasmania Police vehicles are based around several platforms, including the Hybrid Toyota Camry, Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorrento for general (urban) patrol. The Highway Patrol utilise a variety of makes and models employed on a &quot;best-suitability&quot; basis including Subaru Outback, VW Passat, Kia Stinger and BMW 5 series “M Sport” models.The Ford Ranger and Isuzu D Max are currently used as base vehicles for divisional vans, fitted with a custom Varley-brand rotary-moulded, &quot;pod&quot; for transport of prisoners. Divisional vans are also predominantly used as patrol-support vehicles, to transport people under-arrest who have displayed a propensity for violence.

The BMW R1200RT-P motorcycle is the primary motorcycle used in Tasmania, to supplement traffic control and enforcement duties, as well as assist with dignitaries and official ceremonial duties.

Tasmania Police general patrol vehicles are equipped with mobile data terminals, used to interrogate criminal and traffic databases. They also have a general exemption against the Tasmanian government&#x27;s &quot;green-fleet&quot; designations, as most vehicles under this designation are unsuitable for policing duties, and do not comply with Australian standards for the minimum requirements for Australian police vehicles.

==Tasmania Police Pipe Band==
The Tasmania Police Pipe Band was formed in 1969, and wears the Fletcher of Dunans tartan in honour of the Commissioner of Police at the time Mr PW Fletcher. The band is also recognised as the marching band for the Royal Tasmania Regiment, and wears the regiment badge with rosette device on its tartan.

==Tasmania Police Medal==
The Tasmania Police Medal is awarded to sworn officers of the Tasmania Police, for diligent and ethical service.

The medal is circular and nickel-silver, with the obverse featuring the outline of Tasmania emblazoned with the heraldic lion in the centre. The words Tasmania Police around the central device, and &#x27;For diligent and ethical service&#x27; around the vertical edges. The ribbon is the same as some other state police medals.

<text>Skelton Glacier () is a large glacier flowing from the polar plateau into the Ross Ice Shelf at Skelton Inlet on the Hillary Coast, south of Victoria Land, Antarctica.

==Naming and exploration==
Skelton Glacier was named after the Skelton Inlet by the New Zealand party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE), 1956–58. 
The glacier was chosen in 1957 as the New Zealand party&#x27;s route from the Ross Ice Shelf to the Antarctic Plateau.
The Arctic Institute of North America organized two ground traverses in the antarctic summer of 1959–60 sponsored by the United States Antarctic Research Program. 
The first left New Zealand&#x27;s Scott Base on 16 October 1959, crossed part of the Ross Ice Shelf, and on 27 October 1959 reached the foot of the Skelton Glacier.
They traversed up the heavily crevassed glacier to a fuel cache deposited on the edge of the Victoria Land plateau by planes of the United States Navy and Air Force.
From there they travelled more than to the end station of the French 1958–59 traverse, then east toward the head of Tucker Glacier.

==Glaciology==

The Skelton Glacier flows from the high plateau of Victoria Land down to the west edge of the Ross Ice Shelf. It separates the Worcester Range and the Royal Society Range of the Great Antarctic Horst (Transantarctic Mountains).
The elevation in the upper névé field is over , falling to above sea level near Teall Island at its mouth on the Ross Ice Shelf.
The west and east sections of the upper glacier are fed by névé fields separated by the Névé Nunatak, Halfway Nunatak and Clinker Bluff. 
The glacier is also fed by short and steep glaciers from the Worcester Range and Royal Society Range.

Across the mouth, on a line from Teall Island to Fishtail Point, ice thickness varies from , with very little of the ice grounded.
The ocean floor depth along this line varies from below sea level.
Based on 1958–59 measurements of the ice profile and velocity on this line, an estimated equivalent of of water is delivered to the Ross Ice Shelf.
A 1961 study of ice movement on the Skelton Glacier estimated that the Skelton névé field and the small cirque glaciers accumulate equivalent of of water per year, but assuming no more than 30% of this is lost to katabatic winds, it would seem that little or none of the ice delivered to the Ross Ice Shelf comes from the high Antarctic Plateau.

A study of ice-surface lowering in the upper Skelton Glacier was published in 2020.
It concluded that ice surface lowering of the glacier was caused by the retreat of grounded ice in the Ross Sea, which reduced buttressing and drew down the glacier into the Ross Sea.
Most of the lowering since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred between 15,000 and 6,000 years ago.
At Escalade Peak in the upper Skelton valley, far from the mouth, the ice surface was at least and possibly more than higher in LGM than today. 
These ice elevation changes in a slow-flowing upvalley glacier are several hundred meters less than previous models predicted, which mainly focussed on elevation changes at the glacier mouths.

==Course==

Skelton Glacier rises in the Skelton Névé, which is fed by The Portal and the Skelton Icefalls from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.
The névé lies to the east of the Boomerang Range, north of Escalade Peak and south of Portal Mountain.
Scattered nunataks in the névé include Icefall Nunatak, Mount Metschel, Névé Nunatak, Halfway Nunatak, Swartz Nunataks and Clem Nunatak.
The Skelton Glacier flows south from the southeast of the névé.
The east of the névé feeds the Upper Staircase, The Landing and the Lower Staircase.
Lower Staircase flows past Twin Rocks and is fed from the north past Stepaside Spur by Rutgers Glacier, Allison Glacier and Dale Glacier.
Further south it is fed from the east from the Royal Society Range by Potter Glacier and Wirdnam Glacier.

The Lower Staircase joins Skelton Glacier past Clinker Bluff, flowing past Mount Tricouni and Hobnail Peak, below which Skelton Glacier is joined from the east by Baronick Glacier and Cocks Glacier.
Skelton Glacier flows south along the west side of the Worcester Range, from which it is joined by Delta Glacier below Delta Bluff, Dilemma Glacier, Ant Hill Glacier below Ant Hill, and Mason Glacier below Bareface Bluff.
Between Moraine Bluff and Red Dike Bluff to the east it is joined by Trepidation Glacier.
It flows south past Alpha Bluff on Shults Peninsula to the east.
It enters the Ross Ice Shelf to the east of Evteev Glacier.
Cape Timberlake and Teall Island are to the west of the mouth.
Fishtail Point at the end of Shults Peninsula lies to the east of the mouth.

==Head==

<doc id="1128120" wikidata="Q6134813" url="?curid=1128120" title="Angus Graham, 7th Duke of Montrose">
<text>James Angus Graham, 7th Duke of Montrose ID (2 May 1907 – 10 February 1992), styled Earl of Kincardine until 1925 and Marquess of Graham between 1925 and 1954, was a Scottish-born Rhodesian politician, farmer and aristocrat. He served as Minister of Agriculture in the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, and in 1965 was a signatory to Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence.

==Biography==

Born in 1907, the son of James Graham, 6th Duke and Lady Mary Louise, only daughter of William Douglas Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton. His cousin was Colonel Sir Donald Cameron of Lochiel, a prominent Highland soldier and Chief of Clan Cameron.

As Marquess of Graham, the Duke was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. The Marquess of Graham completed three years at Oxford and graduated Bachelor of Arts. Lord Graham (as he then was) first went to Southern Rhodesia in 1930, where he owned a cattle ranch, and took up a position with A.E. &amp; I., the South African subsidiary of ICI. While he was on holiday in England in 1939, the Second World War with Germany was declared. He signed up with the Admiral Commanding Reserves and was appointed Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. He joined as part of Lord Louis Mountbatten&#x27;s flotilla in the North Sea and the evacuations of Crete and Greece following the German invasion of Greece.

On 20 January 1954 he inherited his father&#x27;s titles and became the 7th Duke of Montrose, taking his seat in the House of Lords on 25 June 1957. He took hunting trips in Kenya, where he met his second wife, Susan Semple. The family lived on Derry Farm at Nyabira outside Salisbury, where the crops included maize and tobacco. A pedigree Brahman cattle stud was established after importing bloodstock from Texas.

Montrose was a hard-line supporter of racial separation in Rhodesia. He was a member of the Dominion Party of Rhodesia. He was a founder of the Rhodesian Front, which he helped fund. Following Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Montrose served in the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and later as Minister of Defence and of Foreign Affairs. During his term as Minister of Agriculture, the Land Tenure Act of 1969 was enacted, reserving the amount of land for white ownership as 45 million acres (reduced from 49 million acres) and reserved another 45 million acres for black ownership, introducing parity in theory; however, the most fertile farmland continued to be included in the white portion.

Although, in an article published in &quot;Illustrated Life Rhodesia&quot; in the mid-1970s, Montrose indicated that he saw his family remaining in Rhodesia for future generations, he and his family moved to Natal, South Africa in 1979 and then to Kinross, Scotland, where he spent his final days.

He was a speaker of Gaelic and was fond of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. He was buried in the family cemetery near Loch Lomond.

<text>The was a two-row, 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and used in a variety of World War II Japanese aircraft, such as Mitsubishi J2M and Mitsubishi G4M. The Mitsubishi model designation for this engine was A10 while it was an experimental project, in service it was known as the MK4, and known as the Ha101 &amp; Ha111 by the Army and Kasei by the Navy. According to unified designation code it was Ha-32 of the variants from 11 to 27.

==Design and development==
Although originally ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy, the &quot;Kasei&quot; was based on the earlier Mitsubishi Shinten engine, itself based originally on the Mitsubishi Kinsei. Produced in a wide variety of models, the &quot;Kasei&quot; began with a rated power of , with a gradual evolution to in later wartime versions. Three variants were developed for the Japanese Navy starting in 1939. It was also later adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army as the &quot;Ha-101&quot; engine. Unified code was Ha-32.

Physically, the engine had a rather large diameter compared to the of the Nakajima Homare engine. Its size and weight meant it was a challenging engine to use on single engine fighters.

<text>Chromosome jumping is a tool of molecular biology that is used in the physical mapping of genomes. It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including chromosome walking.

Chromosome jumping is used to bypass regions difficult to clone, such as those containing repetitive DNA, that cannot be easily mapped by chromosome walking, and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly in search of a particular gene. Unlike chromosome walking, chromosome jumping is able to start on one point of the chromosome in order to traverse potential distant point of the same chromosome without cloning the intervening sequences. The ends of a large DNA fragment is the target cloning section of the chromosome jumping while the middle section gets removed by sequences of chemical manipulations prior to the cloning step. 

== Process ==
Chromosome jumping enables two ends of a DNA sequence to be cloned without the middle section. Genomic DNA may be partially digested using restriction endonuclease and with the aid of DNA ligase, the fragments are circularized at low concentration. From a known sequence, a primer is designed to sequence across the circularized junction. This primer is used to jump 100 kb-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularization, it permits jumping and sequencing in an alternative manner. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can also be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for gene-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome. Combining chromosome jumping to chromosome walking through the chromosome allows bypassing repetitive DNA for the search of the target gene.

=== Library ===

Chromosome jumping library is different from chromosome walking due to the manipulations executed before the cloning step. In order to construct the library of chromosome jumping, individual clones originate from random points in the genome (general jumping libraries first basic protocol) or from the termini of specific restriction fragments (specific jumping libraries alternate protocol) should be identified. 

==== NotI-digested DNA ====
One example to build a library is a classified as a rare-cutting restriction endonuclease such as NotI. In order to construct and characterize a library based from NotI-digested human DNA, random clones were analyzed by restriction mapping. Due to the wide distribution of fragment sizes made by the complete digestion with NotI, the library was constructed into two fractions, low and high plasmid concentration. Clones that possessed unique end fragments were then analyzed by hybridization to Pulse Field Gradient (PFG) Southern blots. Examining the results gathered for single and double digests of human DNA with enzymes NotI, BssHII, and NruI, a restriction map with 850 kb was region containing the linking and jumping clones were created. Furthermore, NotI fragments of 250 and 350 kb jumps were evident in the two end clones derived corresponding to genetic distances of 0.25 and 0.35 cM.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The advantages of chromosome jumping are:

* Allows more rapid movement through the genome compared to other techniques, such as chromosome walking.
* Able to travel across chromosomal regions containing unclonable sequences in bacterial hosts.
* Thirdly, this technique can be used to generate genomic markers with known chromosomal locations. 
*Combination of jumping and linking jumping libraries to walking offers possibility of directional walking and might allow the analysis of longer regions in parallel mapping strategies. 
*Reduces the complexity of libraries to be screened and constructed of mammalian genome. 

However, despite these advantages, chromosome jumping is still restricted by the capacity of the cloning vector which is the distance of the ends of the two fragments which can be approximately hundreds of kilobases. Additionally, because the jump does not clone the intervening DNA, chromosome walking would have to be done to identify all the genes present in the DNA. Regardless, it is still deemed to be beneficial due to the possibility to jump over hundred kilobases in comparison to chromosome walking.

=== Applications ===

==== Genetic disorders ====
Chromosome jumping libraries help address the complication of standard cloning techniques with large molecular distances. This process allowed the possibility to use the chromosome jumping library for other genetic disorders that requires 100 kilobases jumps. Particularly for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, its gene is located in human chromosome 7, was able to utilize the chromosome jumping library to search for a jumping clone, met oncogene. Identification of the cystic fibrosis was complicated due to it existing in eukaryotic genes that is composed with coding (exons) and non-coding (introns) segments, where introns are small in size making them difficult for detection. Another struggle in recognizing cystic fibrosis gene is because mammalian cells contains variety of repetitive DNA that can lead to incorrect cloning and blockage of DNA Replication and can cause instability. Both these complications, traditional cloning techniques are unable to process because large yield of exons would have to be visible to produce a signal for the cystic fibrosis gene to be identified and DNA would have to be free of any repetitive elements.

<doc id="1128147" wikidata="Q695959" url="?curid=1128147" title="Turtle ship">
<text>A turtle ship (; ) was a type of warship that was used by the Korean Joseon Navy from the early 15th century up until the 19th century. They were used alongside the panokseon warships in the fight against invading Japanese fleets. The ship&#x27;s name derives from its covering that was said to resemble a turtle shell. Some historians have described it as a very early type of ironclad though the historical evidence for this is uncertain.

== History ==
The first references to older, first-generation turtle ships, known as &quot;gwiseon&quot; (, ), come from 1413 and 1415 records in the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, which mention a mock battle between a &quot;gwiseon&quot; and a Japanese warship. However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea&#x27;s naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace.

Turtle ships participated in the war against Japanese naval forces supporting Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s attempts to conquer Korea from 1592 to 1598. Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who won all battles against the Japanese Navy, is credited with designing the improved turtle ship. From their first appearance in the Battle of Sacheon, his turtle contributed to winning 16 battles against the Japanese fleet under the command of various Daimyos primarily from Western Japan, though under the command of Won Gyun the Joseon Navy suffered a devastating defeat in the Battle of Chilcheollyang. It is unknown precisely how many of Yi&#x27;s Turtle Ships were constructed. The cost of one of these armored warships would have been high, especially if the deck was lined with hexagonal iron plates as some sources suggest.

==Design and construction==

Later turtle ships evinced some structural changes from to earlier versions. For example, later iterations of the Turtle Ship had a higher bulwark height. This alteration in the design was made so that more bulwark slots could be added. In turn, these slots could be used for additional weaponry or ventilation for the vessel&#x27;s occupants. Early illustrations also show initial versions of the ship consisting of overlapping planks on the deck structure, while later depictions show the deck of the vessel covered with flush, hexagonal plates made of wood or iron. Nonetheless, in both earlier and later versions, the Turtle Ship was designed to be surprisingly fast, as it was both oar and sail-powered.

=== Roofing ===
There are non-contemporary sources that state that the turtle ship was covered with metal plates, which would make it the first armored ship in history. While it is clear from the available sources that the roof of the ship was covered with iron spikes to prevent boarding, there is split opinion among historians on whether the turtle ship was ironclad.

There are no contemporary Korean sources from Yi Sun-sin&#x27;s time that refer to the turtle ship as ironclad. One Japanese chronicle mentions a clash in August 1592 which involved three Korean turtle ships &quot;covered in iron.&quot; This could refer to the iron spikes protruding from their roofs. Historian Stephen Turnbull, however, points out the fact that in February 1593 the Japanese government ordered the military to use an iron plate in building ships, possibly in response to the Korean attacks.

Samuel Hawley has suggested that the idea of ironclad turtle ships has its origins in the writings of late 19th-century Westerners returning from Korea. The progression from simple comparison to a statement that the turtle ships anticipated the modern ironclad by centuries can be roughly charted in retrospect, starting no earlier than ca. 1880. Coming in touch with local tales of ancient armored ships in a period which saw the rise of Western-type ironclad warship to global prominence, these authors may have naturally conjured up the image of metal armor instead of a more traditional heavy timber shell. For instance, during the &quot;General Sherman&quot; incident, the Koreans initially constructed an improvised turtle ship, which was protected by metal sheeting and cowhides to destroy &quot;General Sherman&quot; but failed to penetrate its iron hull at the cost of one of their sailors. When the French Navy threatened Korea, the government ordered an ironclad ship be built &quot;like the turtle ship.&quot; However, despite all efforts the design failed to float. Turnbull believes that the 19th-century experience should not rule out a &quot;limited amount of armor plating in 1592&quot;.

=== Spikes ===
Metal spikes were used to cover the top of the turtle ship to deter boarding tactics used by the Japanese. According to historical records, the spikes were covered with empty rice sacks or rice mats to lure the Japanese into trying to board, since the boarding would appear safe. However, modern authors have found this to be unlikely since such an arrangement would have invited enemy fire arrows.

==Armament==
The turtle ship was equipped with &quot;cheonja&quot; &quot;heaven&quot;, &quot;jija&quot; &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;hyeonja&quot; &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;hwangja&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; type chongtong (Joseon cannons). There was also an arquebus known as &quot;seungja&quot; (victory). The &quot;seungja&quot; ranged while the &quot;hwangja&quot; was the lightest but with a range of . According to Hae-Ill Bak, one Japanese record of the Battle of Angolpo records the experience of two Japanese commanders on July 9, 1592, in their battle against turtle ships: &quot;their (turtle ships&#x27;) attack continued until about 6 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon by firing large fire-arrows through repeated alternate approaches, even as close as 18–30 feet. As a result, almost every part of our ships—the turret, the passages and the side shielding—were totally destroyed...&quot;

A dragon&#x27;s head was placed on the top of the ship at the bow. Several different versions of the dragon&#x27;s head were used on the turtle ships. The dragon&#x27;s head was first placed as an early form of psychological warfare in order to scare Japanese soldiers. One version carried a projector that could release a dense toxic smoke that was generated to obscure vision and interfere with the Japanese ability to maneuver and coordinate properly.

==Modern reconstructions==
A turtle ship has been reconstructed by Geobukseon Research Center (), a private commercial company. They have done extensive research on the original design of the turtle ship, and made several real-size reconstructions of them for commercial use. These were deployed in a Korean drama, &quot;The Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin&quot;. Several museums host turtle ships on display, and people can visit and go inside a 1:1 scale turtle ship that is anchored at Yeosu. North Korean delegations to the south seem to be more reserved about the significance of its historical role.

<text>Herculaneum Dock was part of the Port of Liverpool in Liverpool, England. It was at the south end of the Liverpool dock system, on the River Mersey. To the north it was connected to Harrington Dock. The dock was named after the Herculaneum Pottery Company that had previously occupied the site.

==History==
From 1767, a tidal basin in the area that would become the dock was used for unloading copper for a smelting works. Between 1794 and 1841 it was the site of a pottery. In 1864, a new dock designed by George Fosbery Lyster was blasted from the foreshore, providing two graving docks. This dock opened in 1866. Ten years later, a third graving dock was added.

Beginning in 1873, the dock handled petroleum. In 1878, specialist casemates were built to store this and other volatile cargo within the sandstone cliffs above. The dock continued in this capacity until the task of oil handling was transferred across the river to Tranmere Oil Terminal and Stanlow Oil Refinery. During 1881 the dock facility was enlarged further and a fourth graving dock was constructed in 1902.

Liverpool remained an important port during the Second World War, with Herculaneum Dock acting as a terminus for the North Atlantic Convoys.

Herculaneum Dock was formerly served by its own station on the Liverpool Overhead Railway. The station (and railway) closed on 30 December 1956. By 1958 demolition of the station had been completed.

In 1972, Herculaneum Dock closed being filled in during the 1980s to create a car park.

==After closure==
The area south of the dock contained a tank farm; this was reclaimed for the Liverpool Garden Festival and residential properties.

In 2004, the site was bought by national property developer David McLean Homes and a riverside residential development, called City Quay, Liverpool was built on the dock.

Since the closing of Herculaneum Dock, what was the main dock area now comprises car parks, a fitness club, a Car dealership and residential buildings. Graving docks 1 2 and 3 are now occupied by residential buildings. Graving Dock no.4 has been restored as a water feature within the residential estate. The map of 1901 shows the entrance to the dock with the letter &#x27;L&#x27;. A restaurant has since been built on this.

<text>The Dennistoun Glacier () is a glacier, long, draining the northern slopes of Mount Black Prince, Mount Royalist and Mount Adam in the Admiralty Mountains of Victoria Land, Antarctica. 
It flows northwest between the Lyttelton Range and Dunedin Range, turning east on rounding the latter range to enter the sea south of Cape Scott.
==Exploration and naming==
The coastal extremity of the Dennistoun Glacier was charted in 1911–12 by the Northern Party, led by Victor Campbell, of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13 (BrAE).
The glacier is named after Jim Dennistoun, a New Zealand alpinist who was in charge of the mules on board the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; on her way to Antarctica. The entire extent of the glacier was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and United States Navy aerial photography, 1960–63. 
The name Fowlie Glacier, which in fact refers to a tributary glacier, has sometimes been inadvertently misapplied to this feature.

==Location==
The Dennistoun Glacier rises in the Admiralty Mountains between the Lyttelton Range and the Dunedin Range.
The Anare Pass is to its west, forming a route to the Ebbe Glacier.
The Dennistoun Glacier flows north and then east, fed by the Rowles Glacier and Lann Glacier from the southeast.
It passes the Hedgpeth Heights and Quam Heights to the north in the Anare Mountains.
It enters the sea to the southeast of Cape Scott and northwest of Ponting Cliff and Meares Cliff.
At its mouth it is joined from the south by Nash Glacier and Wallis Glacier, which flow from the Dunedin Range past Mount Parker to the west of their mouths.
==Features==
===Atkinson Glacier===
A glacier between Findlay Range and Lyttelton Range, flowing northward into Dennistoun Glacier. 
Named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1983 after William Atkinson, field assistant, New Zealand Antarctic Division, mechanic with the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme (NZARP) geological party to the area, 1981-82, led by R.H. Findlay.

===Fowlie Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, in the Admiralty Mountains. 
From a common head with Dennistoun Glacier, it flows northwest between Mount Ajax and Mount Faget, entering the main flow of the Dennistoun Glacier at the southeast base of the Lyttelton Range. 
Named after Walter Fowlie of the New Zealand Antarctic Division, field assistant with a NZARP geological party to this area, 1981-82, led by R.H. Findlay. 
The original application of the name (NZ-APC, United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names or US-ACAN, 1983) was revised in 1994 in relation to Dennistoun Glacier.

===Rowles Glacier===
Tributary glacier over long, flowing northwest along the east side of Dunedin Range to enter Dennistoun Glacier. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for D.S. Rowles of the New Zealand Dept. of Scientific and Industrial Research, a member of the Hallett Station party, 1964.

===Lann Glacier===
A steep tributary glacier, long, in the north end of Admiralty Mountains. 
The glacier is east of Rowles Glacier and flows northwest to enter Dennistoun Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Roy R. Lann, United States Navy cook at Hallett Station, 1964.

===Ponting Cliff===
An angular cliff that is similar in appearance to Meares Cliff just eastward, located east of the terminal confluences of the Dennistoun, Nash and Wallis Glaciers.

===Meares Cliff===
An angular coastal cliff that rises to high, located west-northwest of Nelson Cliff along the north coast of Victoria Land. 
First charted by the Northern Party, led by Campbell, of the BrAE, 1910-13.
Named by Campbell for Cecil H. Meares who had charge of the dogs on this expedition.

===Mount Parker===
A bluff-type mountain high along the west side of Nash Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
The name Mount Parker was given to a mountain in this general vicinity by Captain James Ross, RN, in 1840, honoring V. Admiral Sir William Parker, a senior naval lord of the Admiralty, 1834 41. 
For the sake of historical continuity US-ACAN has retained the name for this mountain.

===Nash Glacier===
A glacier, long, draining the north slopes of Dunedin range.

<text>Rajahmundry ( ), officially Rajamahendravaram, is a city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and district headquarters of East Godavari district. It is the seventh most populated city in the state. During British rule, the district of Rajahmundry was created in the Madras Presidency in 1823. It was reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts. Kakinada was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. It is administered under Rajahmundry revenue division of the East Godavari district. The city is known for its floriculture, history, culture, agriculture, economy, tourism, and its heritage. It is known as the &quot;Cultural Capital of Andhra Pradesh&quot;.

The city&#x27;s name was derived from Rajaraja Narendra, the ruler of Chalukya dynasty of 11th century who ruled over the city. In 2015, the city was renamed to Rajamahendravaram from the earlier name of Rajahmundry.

== Etymology ==

The city was earlier called &quot;Rajamahendravaram&quot;, derived from the Sanskrit name &quot;Rajamahendrapuram&quot; (The city of King Mahendra). Carrying the same meaning, it is also referred to as &quot;Rajamahendri&quot;. During Qutb Shahi, Mughal, and Nizam rule, it was referred to in official records as Rājmandrī and the same name was anglicized during the British colonial era as &quot;Rajahmundry&quot;. On 10 October 2015, the State Government of Andhra Pradesh officially renamed the city with its original name Rajamahendravaram.

== History ==

Rajahmundry was established by Ammaraja Vishnuvardhana the First (919–934 AD). The city as a prominent settlement can be traced back to the rule of the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra, who reigned around 1022 AD. Remains of 11th-century palaces and forts still exist.

Rulers:
* Eastern Chalukyas
* Cholas
* Kakatiyas
* Eastern Ganga Dynasty
* Reddies 
* Gajapati Empire
* Vijayanagar Rulers
* Bahmani Sultanate
* Golconda Sultanate
* Nizam Rule
* European Rulers and Zamindars

Rajahmundry was under Dutch rule for some time. In 1602, the Dutch constructed a fort here. In 1857, the British conquered the Dutch. They converted it into a jail in 1864 and elevated it into a central jail in 1870. The jail is spread over 196 acres (79 ha) out of which the buildings occupy 37.24 acres (15.07 ha).

In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823. It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was split, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became headquarters of West Godavari.

Rajahmundry was the hotbed of several movements during India&#x27;s freedom struggle and acted as a base for many key leaders. When the Indian National Congress had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India&#x27;s noted English daily, &quot;The Hindu&quot;.

He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at Dowleswaram in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. Bipin Chandra Pal visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in &quot;Pal Chowk&quot; (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). Annie Besant visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950–51 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.

Rajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of Telugu literature—its grammar evolved from the pen of the city-born poet Nannayya. Also known as &#x27;Ādi Kavi&#x27; (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with Tikkana and Yerrana, translated the Sanskrit version of Mahabharata into Telugu.

<doc id="1128156" wikidata="Q3306020" url="?curid=1128156" title="Australian Customs and Border Protection Service">
<text>The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service was an Australian federal government agency responsible for managing the security and integrity of the Australian border and facilitating the movement of legitimate international travellers and goods, whilst protecting the safety, security and commercial interests of Australians. It was headquartered in Canberra and employed over 5,800 people around Australia and overseas.

The agency was under the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department from 2009 to 2013, and then transferred to the newly formed Department of Immigration and Border Protection in 2013, until its transformation into the Australian Border Force in 2015.

==Agency role==
The Service defined its role as follows:
&quot;“Our role is complex and diverse and requires a very considered and increasingly targeted approach to conducting our business. If we do not manage our responsibilities effectively, the potential impacts… may negatively affect the Australian community, international travellers and trade relations both here and overseas”&quot; 

The Service was Australia&#x27;s predominant border control agency. From international travellers at airports, to overseas mail and trade brought in by sea, it was responsible for the continued safety and security of the people and goods that travel across Australia&#x27;s borders.
In conjunction with the Australian Defence Force, the Service facilitated Australia&#x27;s response to the detection and rescue of &#x27;suspected irregular entry vessels&#x27; that smuggled people from South-East Asia into Australian waters. The agency was also responsible for the discovery and apprehension of &#x27;illegal foreign fishing vessels&#x27;, the patrol of remote Australian and international waters, and aerial surveillance of Australia&#x27;s coastline. To achieve these functions, the Service operated its own air and sea patrol unit, the Customs Marine Unit.

The Service used an intelligence-led, risk-based approach to managing threats, focussing on specific targets that may pose a risk to the border. This allowed the agency to plan coordinated responses, interventions and strategies with various other government agencies, including; Australian Crime Commission, Australian Federal Police, Attorney-General&#x27;s Department, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Office of Transport Security.

===Import and export control===
Customs controlled the import and export of goods to and from Australia, in particular the control of prohibited or restricted items, and the interception of illegal and potentially harmful goods such as drugs, weapons and computer games. Techniques used to target high-risk aircraft, vessels, cargo, postal items and travellers included using intelligence, computer-based profiling and analysis, detector dogs, Smartgate, container X-ray facilities, closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring and other means.

Customs officers at air and sea ports, in addition to performing basic immigration control (see below), assessed passengers arrival and departure cards, and had the authority to scan and search passenger baggage. Quarantine risk material could be referred to Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers.

Goods arriving from overseas by post were cleared by Customs and AQIS officers before being released to Australia Post for delivery.

Customs collected goods and services tax (GST) on taxable goods imported into Australia.

Customs administered the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) for tourists visiting Australia temporarily or Australian residents leaving the country, allowing them, under certain conditions, to claim a refund of the GST or Wine equalisation tax on items purchased in Australia.

===People smuggling===
The Service was the lead agency in the Australian government&#x27;s response to people-smuggling and often performed activities on behalf of other agencies including:
* Monitoring Australian waters for potential people smuggling vessels
* Intercepting boats carrying immigrants without valid visas with Bay Class vessels
* Transporting people found in vessels to Australian territory for immigration and quarantine assessment
* Coordinating education and awareness campaigns overseas to deter people-smuggling activities

===Terrorism===
The Service operated under the &#x27;National Counter-Terrorism Plan&#x27;, which was a plan intended to mitigate any risk of terrorism in Australia. The Service worked in conjunction with other Australian Government departments to screen and target any potential threats moving across the border, including:
* Air and sea passengers
* Cargo (sea, air and mail)
* Maritime surveillance
* Remote area patrols

===Illegal entry===
The Service was responsible for processing all travellers entering and leaving the country. At the border, Service officers would check all passengers to ensure compliance with customs, immigration and quarantine requirements. The Service&#x27;s purpose was to stop people without correct documentation or visas from entering the country.

===Controlled substances===
One of the largest areas of work undertaken by the Service was in relation to the importation of narcotics and precursor substances and the smuggling of illegal amounts of tobacco. Examination techniques such as x-ray, trace detection technology and detector dogs were used to screen people, goods, mail, vessels and aircraft moving across Australia&#x27;s border.

===Prohibited material===
Australian law prohibits the importing of any material of an offensive, grotesque or otherwise objectionable nature. The Service worked to prevent the importation of material that was either refused classification by the Australian Classification Board, or was unclassified but would likely be refused classification by the Australian Classification Board. This included material in electronic form such as CDs or DVDs, computer hard drives and within electronic games. Prohibited material included, but was not limited to:
* Child pornography
* Offensive or sexualised violence
* Criminal or terrorist material
* Drug use
* Fetish material

===Illegal foreign fishing===
The Service was the lead agency coordinating regular patrol (both aerial surveillance and on-water) of Australia&#x27;s &#x27;Exclusive Economic Zone&#x27; to detect and deter any foreign fishing vessels. Along with dedicated in-country education programs designed to deter people from undertaking illegal fishing, the Service&#x27;s work saw a continual decline in the rates of foreign fishing vessels entering the EEZ.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service had its origins in the Department of Trade and Customs, established at federation in 1901. The organisation was restructured several times since, including becoming the Department of Customs and Excise in 1958 and then briefly the Department of Police and Customs in 1975. Later that same year, the Bureau of Customs was established, which remained the Australian Government&#x27;s customs agency until 1985 when the Australian Customs Service was established.

In December 2008 then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Australian Government would be augmenting, re-tasking and renaming the Australian Customs Service to create the new Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Royal Assent was given to the changes on 22 May 2009 and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service was established.

===Australian Border Force===
In 2015, the Australian Government announced changes to the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio in relation to future border protection arrangements. From 1 July 2015, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service were consolidated into a single Department of Immigration and Border Protection. At this time, the Australian Border Force, a single frontline operational border agency, was established within the department. The Australian Border Force draws together the operational border, investigations, compliance, detention and enforcement functions of the two former agencies, as well as policy, regulatory and corporate functions.

==Agency statistics==
When it existed, each week the Service would:

===Clear===
* 268,000 air passengers arriving in Australia
* 1,620 international flights
* 260 ships arriving in Australian ports from overseas
* 14 overseas smallcraft
* 24,600 export entries
* 268,700 air way bills
* 48,500 sea cargo manifest lines

===Patrol===
* Three million square nautical miles including:
** Australia&#x27;s coastline and seas, including the Southern Ocean and Northern waters
** airports
** sea ports
** mail centres

===Inspect===
* 2000 sea cargo containers
* 29,500 air cargo consignments
* 776,000 letters
* 405,500 parcels from overseas

===Collect===

<doc id="1128169" wikidata="Q3684794" url="?curid=1128169" title="Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission">
<text>The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) is a law enforcement agency established by the Australian federal government on 1 July 2016, following the merger of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) and CrimTrac. It has specialist investigative capabilities and delivers and maintains national information sharing systems. ACIC is part of the National Intelligence Community.

==History==
===Predecessors===
On 1 January 2003, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) was established under the &quot;Australian Crime Commission Act 2002&quot;, superseding the National Crime Authority (NCA), the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments (OSCA).

CrimTrac was established as an agency in the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department in 1990.

===Establishment and legal framework===
On 1 July 2016, the &quot;Australian Crime Commission Amendment (National Policing Information) Act 2016&quot; (Cwlth) amended the ACC Act to implement the carrying over of CrimTrac&#x27;s functions to the ACC, including the provision of systems and services relating to national policing information and nationally coordinated criminal history checks. It was formed to strengthen the country&#x27;s response to crime affecting Australia.

As a Commonwealth statutory authority, the ACIC also has responsibilities under the &quot;Public Service Act 1999&quot; and the &quot;Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013&quot;. The role and functions of the ACIC are underpinned by supporting legislation in each state and territory.

==Roles and functions==
The mission is to make Australia safer through improved national ability to connect, discover, understand and respond to current and emerging crime threats, and criminal justice issues, including the ability for police and law enforcement to access essential policing knowledge and information. The organisation is uniquely equipped as Australia&#x27;s national criminal intelligence agency with investigative, research and information delivery functions. The agency works closely with a broad range of national and international partners to achieve their purpose, while taking account of criminal threats to Australia, and stakeholders&#x27; needs, the ACIC creates a national intelligence picture of crime, targets serious and organised crime, delivers information capability and services to front line policing and law enforcement, and provides crime and justice research that produces an evidence base for addressing crime in Australia. They support and collaborate closely with the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), whose director is also that of the ACIC&#x27;s CEO. The AIC undertakes criminological research, which helps inform law enforcement&#x27;s collective response to crime. The AIC provides independent monitoring, and research programs that enhance knowledge of crime and criminal justice issues in Australia, and it also provides strategic advice to inform policy development and reform.

The ACIC works with law enforcement partners to improve the ability to stop criminals exploiting emerging opportunities and gaps in law enforcement information. They report to the Minister for Home Affairs, and is accountable to and monitored and reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. The ACIC Board includes representatives of Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and key national security and regulatory agencies. The Board also provides strategic direction to the ACIC and is responsible for determining special operations and special investigations. They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), which is tasked with preventing, detecting and investigating law-enforcement related corruption issues.

The ACIC delivers information-sharing solutions between state, territory and federal law enforcement agencies including biometric matching, child protection, firearm services, police reference services, missing persons and domestic violence. The agency does this by bringing together essential law enforcement information from around the country and making it accessible to all Australian police and other law enforcement agencies. They also manage the National Police Checking Service, which service enables controlled access to disclosable police history information from all Australian police agencies. These capabilities are specifically designed to equip police with the information they need to investigate, solve and prevent crimes. This vital information can improve an officer&#x27;s decision-making and contribute to a safer Australia. The ACIC&#x27;s coercive powers are used in special operations and special investigations to obtain information where traditional law enforcement methods are unlikely to be or have not been effective, and similar to those of a Royal Commission, authorise examiners, who are appointed by the Governor General of Australia, to compel persons to give evidence for the purposes of special ACIC operations or investigations.

Examinations are conducted in private, witnesses at examinations are able to claim protection so that the answers, documents or things they provide are not admissible in evidence against them in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty except in limited circumstances. The coercive powers also authorise examiners to issue notices to be served on persons requiring them to produce documents or things relevant to a special operation or investigation. This power is broad, and a notice to produce may be issued to a person, a corporation or a Commonwealth government agency.

<doc id="1128170" wikidata="Q1072619" url="?curid=1128170" title="Aemilia Lepida">
<text>Aemilia Lepida is a Latin feminine given name that was given to the daughters of various Aemilius Lepiduses (), men belonging to the Lepidus branch of the Aemilia (family) that was founded by the Marcus Aemilius Lepidus who served as consul in. The Aemila Lepidas () who appear in Roman historians were principally known for their engagements and marriages, with those in the late Republic and early Empire related to the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

==Aemilia Lepida (1st century BC), wife of Metellus Scipio==
This Aemilia was daughter of Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, wife of Metellus Scipio and former fiancée of Cato. Her daughter was Cornelia Metella, last wife and widow of Pompey the Great. Although Aemilia Lepida was engaged to be married to Cato the Younger, she in fact married someone else, leaving Cato to marry Atilia. In the words of Plutarch:

When [Cato] thought that he was old enough to marry — and up to that time he had consorted with no woman — he engaged himself to Lepida, who had formerly been betrothed to Metellus Scipio, but was now free, since Scipio had rejected her and the betrothal had been broken. However, before the marriage Scipio changed his mind again, and by dint of every effort got the maid. Cato was greatly exasperated and inflamed by this, and attempted to go to law about it; but his friends prevented this, and so, in his rage and youthful fervour, he betook himself to iambic verse, and heaped much scornful abuse upon Scipio, adopting the bitter tone of Archilochus, but avoiding his license and puerility. Lepida and Cato were first cousins with Lepida&#x27;s father and Cato&#x27;s mother being blood siblings.
==Aemilia Lepida, wife of Domitius Ahenobarbus==
Aemilia Lepida may have been the name of the wife of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC), due to the name of Ahenobarbus&#x27;s granddaughter, Domitia Lepida the Younger. Her only child was her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC). Her son married Antonia Major, a niece of Roman Emperor Augustus and a daughter to Augustus&#x27; sister Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. Their children were Domitia Lepida the Elder, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32) and Domitia Lepida the Younger. Aemilia died before 31 BC.

==Aemilia Lepida, wife of L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus==
Aemilia Lepida was a Roman noble woman who lived in the 1st century BC. She was the first wife of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Faustus, who was consul in 5 BC. The couple had several children including her son, suffect consul of 31, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus. One of her daughters-in-law was Domitia Lepida the Younger a great niece of Emperor Augustus and a granddaughter of triumvir Mark Antony. One of her grandchildren was consul Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix.

==Aemilia Lepida, wife of Servilius==
A relative of Claudia Marcella Minor is attested to have been a wife of a Servilius. She may have been the daughter of Lepidus the triumvir.

==Aemilia Lepida (exiled 20), niece Lepidus the Younger==
Aemilia Lepida was the niece of Lepidus the Younger and sister to Manius Aemilius Lepidus. She married the wealthy senator Publius Sulpicius Quirinius. In her younger years, she was engaged to Emperor Augustus’ heir Lucius Caesar. She had borne a daughter to senator Mamercus Aemilius Scaurus.

In 20, she was charged with adultery, poisoning, consulting astrologers, falsely to claim to bear a son to her ex-husband and attempting to poison her ex-husband. At her trial her brother defended her. During her trial, the Games were held. Other distinguished ladies, accompanied her into the theatre and protested her innocence to Emperor Tiberius. She was found guilty and was exiled.

==Aemilia Lepida (1st century), wife of Galba==
Aemilia Lepida was daughter of Manius Aemilius Lepidus, consul in AD 11. This Aemilia Lepida is usually identified with Lepida, wife of the short-lived Roman Emperor Galba. The couple had two sons before her death. She died relatively young, and their sons also died young. Galba never remarried.

When Lepida lived, Agrippina the Younger (a widow after Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus&#x27; death) tried to make shameless advances to Galba, who was devoted to his wife and thus completely uninterested. On one occasion Lepida&#x27;s mother gave Agrippina the Younger, while in the company of a whole bevy of married women, a public reprimand and slapped her in the face.

==Aemilia Lepida, fiancee of Claudius==

Aemilia Lepida (4/3 BC – ?) was the daughter of Lucius Aemilius Paullus and his wife Julia the Younger. She was the first great-grandchild of the Emperor Augustus, and at one time was a fiancée of the future Emperor Claudius. Lepida had several children with her husband, Marcus Junius Silanus, and two of her sons became consuls.

==Aemilia Lepida (died 36), wife of Drusus==
Aemilia Lepida (died 36) was daughter of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 6 and niece to the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus (executed 14 AD). Despite her uncle&#x27;s disgrace, and due to her father&#x27;s high standing with the Roman emperors and the Senate, she married her second cousin Drusus Caesar. According to Dio she was rumoured to have been a mistress of Sejanus. Tacitus reports that during their marriage &quot;she had pursued her husband with ceaseless accusations&quot;. In 36, she was charged with adultery with a slave and committed suicide, &quot;since there was no question about her guilt&quot;.

<doc id="1128175" wikidata="Q300566" url="?curid=1128175" title="A Sound of Thunder (film)">
<text>A Sound of Thunder is a 2005 science fiction thriller film directed by Peter Hyams. It is based on the 1952 short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury. The film stars Edward Burns, Catherine McCormack, and Ben Kingsley. It follows &quot;time tourists&quot; who accidentally interfere too much with the past, completely altering the present.

&quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; was released in the United States on September 2, 2005, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It failed at the box office, earning only $11.8 million against a production budget of $80 million, and received largely negative reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
In the year 2055, the Chicago-based Time Safari company offers the opportunity for rich people to hunt dinosaurs in the past via time travel technology. As a precaution against the potential change of the past, the company preys only on the dinosaurs who would otherwise die of natural causes and keeps the clients from stepping off the designated path. Because of the dangers of interfering with the timeline, the company&#x27;s activities are vocally criticized by Sonia Rand, the developer of the time machine software &quot;TAMI&quot;, who feels disappointed for not receiving credit during her work and is worried that some clients may alter the past through their activities.

A trip with clients Eckels and Middleton goes afoul when the gun brought by team leader Travis Ryer fails to go off. The dinosaur, a female &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, runs towards the group, scattering the clients. Ryer is able to kill the dinosaur and afterwards, regroups the clients and returns to 2055 without further harm. The next day, however, members of Time Safari including CEO Charles Hatton hear reports of global increases in temperature and humidity, and Ryer observes a sudden increase in plant life. On their next trip, Ryer and a new group of clients find that the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; he and the team intend to hunt is already dead and the volcano erupts much sooner. The team quickly returns and reports the changes, causing the government to shut down Time Safari for an investigation. Ryer learns from Rand that Chicago is being struck by &quot;time waves&quot; that cause drastic alterations to the city as they pass due to something that happened on a previous expedition. Ryer and Rand narrowly escape a building after a time wave causes the appearance of thousands of beetles and a tree bursting through its structure. Rand warns that more time waves can be expected, and each will affect more advanced life forms, humans being the last.

Ryer and Rand return to Time Safari to try to fix what has gone wrong along with the government. Unfortunately, another time wave strikes that leaves the city without power and now covered by dense vegetation. Evaluating the machine&#x27;s logs, they find that the Eckels/Middleton expedition had come back a few grams heavier and that the bio-filter was turned off and recognize that they can use the time machine to go back to intercept their past selves so as to prevent whatever happened, but will only have a few seconds to act, and so must work to figure out who they need to stop. The Time Safari finds their equipment and gear free of anything, so Ryer and Rand lead a group through the city - now filled with evolved and deadly hybrids and other new hazards that kill some of their party members in order to find Eckels and Middleton. Eckels is safe but asserts he remained on the path, while Middleton, poisoned by the new wildlife, dies by suicide before they can stop him. Afterwards, they are able to find a dead butterfly on the sole of the shoe he used for the safari. The party makes it back to Time Safari after more time waves hit, now finding the time machine partially underwater and unusable. Rand obtains the hard drive containing the TAMI software with plans to use it with the nearby university&#x27;s particle accelerator as a substitute time machine.

With Ryer and Rand as the only two survivors, they finally make it to the university. Rand notes that the appearance of simian-like Babboonlizards from the latest time wave means the next one will wipe away humanity. Rand prepares the accelerator and stays behind while Ryer goes through the time portal, just as the last time wave hits turning Rand into a humanoid catfish-like creature. Ryer catches up to the previous expedition, tells team member Jenny that the bio-filter is off at the same time asking her to give his earlier self a recording of the events he has witnessed, he then catches Middleton to prevent him from stepping on the butterfly before vanishing. The expedition returns without incident to the future they had left and Ryer shares the footage with Rand, presumably to use it to bring down Time Safari, and make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The film was originally going to be directed by Renny Harlin, star Pierce Brosnan in the main role, and be shot in Montreal, Canada. The budget was meant to be $55 million.

Filming was to have begun in Montreal on 16 April 2001. Brosnan wanted a rewrite of the script. However, the filmmakers did not have time to rewrite and finish the film by July 1, which is when Hollywood writers and actors were poised to go on strike. Matters were complicated when Canadian producer Nicolas Claremont died in April 2001.

By November 2001 Harlin had been replaced by Peter Hyams. Brosnan left the project as well and was replaced by Edward Burns.

After Franchise Pictures went bankrupt during post-production, the remaining backers provided only $30 million to work with, out of the $80 million originally allocated. Previsualization software was used.

=== Filming ===
Shooting took place in the Czech Republic in 2002. The unit was affected by the August 2002 floods.

Kingsley said &quot;I was allowed to give a very ironic comedic performance. I was able to make my director (Peter Hyams) stifle a huge amount of laughter behind the camera.&quot;

Director Peter Hyams said the effects were done &quot;in a mom-and-pop fashion. That&#x27;s the only way we could make this film for a reasonable amount of money. We had stuff done in Germany, Hong Kong, India. We&#x27;ve also taken a long time to get it all completed. The post-production on this film will be over two years by the time we&#x27;re finished. I myself will have worked on it for three years.&quot;

Hyams&#x27; son John later said &quot;it was one of the hardest experiences of his [father&#x27;s] career. You know, it’s got to be a real sinking feeling going into something shooting all of it against green screen with all this trust that you’re relying on this whole element, this whole technology that ultimately you’re not going to be able to afford and you have to do it anyway.&quot;

== Video game ==
A video game based on the film was released for the Game Boy Advance. It had been considerably delayed, and debuted slightly before the film opened, in March 2005. It was an overhead shooter game with driving stages, and support for co-op and death-match multiplayer via link cable. Many people considered the video game to be better than the film it was based on. A game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox was planned in 2003 but got canceled.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
The film was largely panned by both critics and audiences alike. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 6% score based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 2.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Choppy logic and uneven performances are overshadowed by not-so-special effects that makes the suspension of disbelief a nearly impossible task.&quot; Common criticisms against the film included its poor special effects, uninvolved performances, scientific errors and Ben Kingsley&#x27;s hair. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;D−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

James Duffy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; stated &quot;The combination of awful special effects and mediocre acting created this catastrophe,&quot; and it included the film in its list of &quot;Bomb at the box office&quot;. Roger Ebert stated that while he &quot;cannot endorse it, [he] can appreciate it&quot; as a film that is bad because it &quot;want[s] so much to be terrific that [it] explode[s] under the strain.&quot;

At the 2005 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Director, Worst Supporting Actor (Kingsley), Most Intrusive Musical Score, and Least &quot;Special&quot; Special Effects, but it won none of those awards.

=== Box office ===
Due to negative reviews and lack of promotion, the production grossed only $1,900,451 in the United States and $9,765,014 elsewhere for a worldwide total of $11,665,465.

<doc id="1128179" wikidata="Q5185141" url="?curid=1128179" title="CrimTrac">
<text>CrimTrac was a former Agency in the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department that was merged with the Australian Crime Commission on 1 July 2016 to form the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. Crimtrac had been responsible for developing and maintaining national information-sharing services between state, territory and federal law enforcement agencies.

CrimTrac worked in partnership with Australia&#x27;s police agencies to provide services that allowed police to easily share information with each other across state and territory borders. CrimTrac&#x27;s information-sharing capabilities were specifically designed to equip police with the information needed to make decisions to assist in investigating and preventing crime.

Under the Australian Constitution, each state and territory is responsible for maintaining law and order within its borders, with the Australian Federal Police serving the Commonwealth. Criminals have exploited borders to avoid detection, but when police have a national view of policing information, this minimises opportunities for offenders to evade the law by crossing borders.

==History==
CrimTrac was established to modernise the IT systems created by the National Exchange of Policing Information (NEPI) formed in 1990 and to add new systems required by Australian police to meet changing national law enforcement needs. These include biometric identification of persons of interest via fingerprints and DNA, and other policing information. Fifty million dollars was provided by the Federal government following the 1998 election, and procedural and administrative work commenced to create CrimTrac and transition the NEPI systems over. An Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) signed by Federal, State and Territory law enforcement ministers in July 2000 has underpinned the agency&#x27;s endeavours.

CrimTrac commenced as a small national agency located in the national capital - Canberra, and staffed by Australian Public Servants. Police specialists and contractors assist where necessary. It has required strong cooperation from all police services, particularly on Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Even with the advantage of an IGA, CrimTrac&#x27;s startup, growth and management in the first five years was challenging as it addressed its NEPI legacy whilst scoping new IT systems to deliver better shared policing information. Those years required sustained effort by the staff of CrimTrac and by its Board of Management, drawn from the IGA parties, at Police Commissioner level. CrimTrac continues to face challenges as a result of Australia&#x27;s federational style of government, which has produced nine different sets of criminal legislation and nine individual police systems that must communicate to allow the centralisation of policing information. The national DNA database took eight years to become fully functional because of minor differences in Commonwealth, state and territory legislation.

While Australian police services and law enforcement agencies need and want better information systems to support officers on the beat, they do not wish these systems to necessarily replace their existing systems. Their systems are at differing levels of sophistication and evolution on different computing platforms, architectures and types and formats of information stored. They have been built and had evolved to suit jurisdictional, not national requirements.

To achieve optimal outcomes from its new or improved national IT systems, CrimTrac had worked hard for a new and better culture of information sharing between police services. Regular and informative liaison characterises CrimTrac&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; with police and strong arguments accompany all CrimTrac business cases where police services may be asked to contribute or share information. The impact of the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 is also taken into account through the requirement for all new projects that involve the national sharing of sometimes sensitive and usually confidential personal information to prepare a privacy impact assessment.

Improving legacy IT systems or building new ones understandably has involved controversy as existing state and territory-based policing information systems were scrutinised by CrimTrac in order to establish &quot;best of breed&quot; designs, to analyse better information-sharing practices for national adoption and to persuade police jurisdictions to use new CrimTrac systems. In the almost eight years since CrimTrac was established, distrust and controversy has been replaced by support and cooperation from all the partner police services.

By 30 June 2015, 1 year before it was merged into the new agency, CrimTrac employed 207 people.

==Biometrics==
CrimTrac&#x27;s NCIDD and NAFIS systems provide police agencies with biometric matching capabilities that assist the police with identity management and to resolve crime.

===National Automated Fingerprint Identification System===
The National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) is a fingerprint and palm print database and matching system, which is available to Australian police and immigration authorities.

The NAFIS assists Australian police to solve crime by quickly and reliably establishing a person&#x27;s identity from fingerprint and palm impressions. The NAFIS enables near ‘real time’ upload of prints from crime scenes which makes it possible for police to identify a suspect in minutes.

The NAFIS contains finger and palm print images collected from individuals by Australian police and immigration authorities. It also contains unsolved fingerprint and palm print crime scene images, which Australian police can search against.

The NAFIS contains fingerprint or palm print records for more than 3.3 million people, with a total of 5.6 million sets of prints. In the 2011-12 financial year users conducted 428,831 searches on prints from individuals. During this period, there was 367,751 searches conducted on finger and palm prints from latent fingerprints, which are collected at crime scenes.

===National Criminal Investigation DNA Database===
The National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD) provides Australian police with the ability to match DNA profiles across state and territory borders.

The NCIDD contains DNA profiles from samples collected by Australian police. These profiles are derived from samples collected at crime scenes, or from convicted offenders, suspects, items belonging to missing persons and unknown deceased persons.

The NCIDD enables police agencies to compare DNA profiles from a crime scene with convicted offenders throughout Australia. Additionally, the database allows police to match profiles from two or more unsolved crime scenes, linking seemingly unrelated police investigations.

By 30 June 2012, the NCIDD had linked 69,606 individuals to crime scenes, and had made 12,216 crime scene to crime scene links. At 31 December 2012, there were 713,200 profiles recorded on the NCIDD.

As well as their ongoing day to day value to Australian police, the international value of these systems was proven following the Bali bombings in 2002 and the Australian response to the Thailand tsunami of 2004.

==Child Protection==
===National Child Offender System===
The National Child Offender System (NCOS) provides operational police with tools to achieve nationally consistent registration and management of child offenders. 
The NCOS consists of the Australian National Child Offender Register (ANCOR) and the Managed Person System (MPS). 
The ANCOR supports online crime prevention and allows authorised police officers to register, case manage and share information about registered persons. It assists police to uphold child protection legislation in their state or territory. 
The MPS holds information on offenders who are charged but not convicted, or after an offender&#x27;s reporting obligations have been completed.

===Child Exploitation Tracking System===
The Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS) is a joint initiative between CrimTrac, police agencies and Microsoft. 
The primary objective of the CETS is to improve police efforts to identify children exposed to significant risk of sexual abuse, and reduce police exposure to child exploitation material. 
The CETS automatically matches seized child exploitation material with previously identified material. This makes it easier for police to identify material created by an offender, and increases police capacity to identify victims.

==Police Reference Services==
===National Police Reference System===
The National Police Reference System (NPRS) enables Australian police agencies to integrate their data with data from other police agencies. The NPRS supports police and other law enforcement agencies by providing key reference data to support first responders, investigators and analysts.

In the 2011-12 financial year, more than 53,000 police users conducted 35 million transactions using the NPRS. During this period, 10 million person records with 5.7 million photographs were available for law enforcement purposes. On average, there are 96,000 daily transactions made on the NPRS.

Some of the information included about a person of interest on the NPRS includes: name; identity information (including photographs); information on warnings, warrants and whether an individual is wanted by police; offence history; protection and violence orders; firearms involvements; and information relating to the child protection register.

The NPRS also contains information on missing persons, unidentified persons and bodies, and escapees.

In May 2012 the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) was the first authorised non-police agency to gain access to NPRS for law-enforcement purposes.

===National Firearms Licensing and Registration System===
The National Firearms Licensing and Registration System (NFLRS) holds information on:

• past and current firearm license holders
• licensed firearms dealers
• registered, lost or stolen firearms.

CrimTrac collects and shares firearm license and registration information between all police agencies and approved external agencies. Police officers responding to an incident can be advised if a person is the registered owner of a firearm. There are more than 4.5 million firearms recorded on the NFLRS.

===National Vehicles of Interest===
The National Vehicle of Interest (NVOI) system records stolen, recovered and suspect vehicle details. This service enables Australian police agencies to share information on vehicle registration, driver license and vehicle owner details.

In the 2011-12 financial year, more than 188,000 incidents were registered on the system.

==National Police Checking Service==
CrimTrac worked together with Australia&#x27;s police agencies to deliver the National Police Checking Service (NPCS). The NPCS enhances the safety and security of the community by ensuring the integrity of individuals placed in a position of trust.

The NPCS provides Australian police agencies, and other agencies accredited with CrimTrac, with a national view of police history information. A National Police History Check involves checking and releasing police information about an individual, subject to relevant legislation and policies. This is used to assess an individual&#x27;s suitability for employment, Australian citizenship, or appointment to positions of trust.

CrimTrac delivers the NPCS to more than 120 organisations across the country. These include police agencies, public and private sector organisations and not-for-profit organisations.

The NPCS processed approximately 3 million checks in the 2011-12 financial year. Approximately 29 per cent of all checks require further investigation by police.

CrimTrac is working with New Zealand Police in a trial of sharing police history information.

<doc id="1128187" wikidata="Q7371658" url="?curid=1128187" title="Rove (TV series)">
<text>Rove, also titled Rove Live, is an Australian television variety show that featured live music performances and interviews with local and international celebrity guests. The program premiered on the Nine Network on 22 September 1999, before moving to Network Ten which aired the program from 2000 until November 2009. The show was hosted by comedian Rove McManus through his production company Roving Enterprises, and featured an ensemble cast who presented various segments throughout the course of the show. The show won the Logie Award for &quot;Most Popular Light Entertainment Program&quot; five times (2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009).
==History==

===Origins: &quot;The Loft Live&quot;===
Rove McManus began his television career hosting the RMITV-produced &quot;The Loft Live&quot; on C31 Melbourne, a community-access television station. It was a straightforward tonight show, with a comic monologue from the host, pre-recorded skits and guest interviews. The show had unusually high production values for a community access show.

===1999: &quot;Rove&quot; (Nine Network)===
The Nine Network developed the show into a commercial production. In 1999, the show, named &quot;Rove&quot;, ran in a late-night timeslot for 10 episodes. The show featured McManus and three co-hosts he referred to as &#x27;the kids on the couch&#x27;: Peter Helliar, Corinne Grant and Dave Callan. However, Nine decided not to renew the program and the cast moved to Network Ten the following year.

===Move to Network Ten===

====2000–2006: &quot;Rove Live&quot;====

The new show, very similar to the Nine production, was named &quot;Rove Live&quot;. The show was sometimes known as &quot;Rove [Live]&quot; or &quot;Rove (Live)&quot;, owing to the use of (square) brackets around the word &#x27;Live&#x27; in some of the show&#x27;s graphics.

Dave Callan left the show after one year, to pursue standup comedy and radio opportunities. Corinne Grant left the show at the end of 2005, to concentrate on &quot;The Glass House&quot; and other interests. Carrie Bickmore joined the cast in 2006, presenting a parody news segment. Meshel Laurie joined the cast for only one year.

In November 2006, &quot;Rove Live&quot; was suspended until further notice due to the death of McManus&#x27;s wife Belinda Emmett. Rove wrote a personal message on the &quot;Rove Live&quot; website, saying that it &quot;is a very difficult period for all of us and some time away is the best thing for me right now&quot;.

====2007–2009: &quot;Rove&quot;====
The show reverted to the title of &quot;Rove&quot; in 2007. Production moved from the Global Television facility in Nunawading to the old Seven Network studios in South Melbourne. It now occupied the premium timeslot of 8:30pm on Sunday nights.

Peter Helliar returned to McManus&#x27;s side. Bickmore&#x27;s role in the show increased. Following the cancellation of the show &quot;The Glass House&quot;, Dave Hughes joined &quot;Rove&quot;. The comedy duo Hamish &amp; Andy, who had previously collaborated with Roving Enterprises with their television show &quot;Real Stories&quot;, began appearing every second week. Their associate Ryan Shelton also began presenting a segment each week.

Each year, the show&#x27;s set changes in some way from the previous. In a previous year, the set was changed to be less like a traditional late-night talk show and more like a variety show. In 2007, the show&#x27;s set was reconfigured back into a more traditional late-night talk show again, even going so far as having a view of the Melbourne cityscape in the background.

In July 2007, a special show was filmed at Times Square in New York. Rove, Helliar and Adam Hills attended, and a live Australian audience was present. In late July a second special was filmed in Los Angeles at the Bob Barker Studio.

Hayden Guppy now also co-host of &quot;Video Hits&quot; also became a cast member, who shows TV viewers what the cast does during ad breaks.

In 2008, Myf Warhurst, who co-hosted a breakfast radio show with Peter Helliar on Triple M, joined the cast as an infrequent addition whenever a regular cast member was unavailable. Again in 2008, Elmo returned as a guest.

In 2009 the program moved premises to ABC studios in Elsternwick which housed a new set. Dave Hughes, Hamish Blake and Andy Lee began only appearing on a fortnightly basis. Between May and July 2009, actor Brian Wenzel had a weekly skit at the end of the show.

After 12 July, the show went off-air to let the team take a mid-year break due to the show starting in February (earlier than 2007 and 2008). It was also announced that this episode would be Bickmore&#x27;s and Hughesy&#x27;s final episode as regular cast members, due to them both leaving to focus on their new show, &quot;The 7pm Project&quot;, which premiered on 20 July 2009, and is also produced by Roving Enterprises.

===Series finale===
Various news reports appeared in the lead-up to the scheduled season finale for the 2009 season of &quot;Rove&quot; that it would be the final season. The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; originally reported that McManus had confirmed that his show would not return until later in 2010. Despite not appearing on a list of shows at Ten&#x27;s 2010 launch event, it was rumoured that &quot;Rove&quot; would return in 2010 with a new format, similar to &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, which rated over two million viewers for its two reunion shows. McManus made a comment to the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; and stated: &quot;This show is my love and my passion and it&#x27;s always what I&#x27;ve wanted to do.&quot; McManus then continued to say &quot;If everything else fell down, as long as I still get to do this thing I love then I’m happy. We have that connection with the audience at the moment and that&#x27;s where my enthusiasm is coming from.&quot;

However, rumours appeared the day before the 2009 finale of &quot;Rove&quot; in that &quot;staff on his TV show were told this week to look for alternative work next year.&quot; Ten&#x27;s publicity department denied these claims by stating: &quot;We have checked with Roving (Enterprises) and no such discussion was had. As for what changes may or may not be made with Rove for 2010, this will be announced on the show this Sunday, stay tuned.&quot; McManus was spotted earlier dining with Merrick Watts and Peter Helliar in Sydney, prompting talk that he might return to radio in 2010.

The rumour of the show ending later revealed to be true, as, during the finale on 15 November 2009, McManus confirmed that the show would be ending with the 2009 finale. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s purely my decision. It&#x27;s not one I&#x27;ve made lightly or flippantly. The timing was right to stop, stand back and see what happens next.&quot;

The final show finished at 11:11pm with a montage of clips from the 2009 season and a performance by Powderfinger. Rove&#x27;s last words was a variation of his signature sign-off: &quot;I&#x27;m Rove McManus. Say bye to your mum for me.&quot;

==Format ==
The show starts with Rove performing a comedic monologue about a variety of news events that have occurred during the previous week. He then introduces Peter Helliar and the other cast members present on the couch that week.

&quot;PeteSpace&quot;, a parody of social-networking website MySpace, consists of Helliar presenting a selection of celebrities, news-makers and online video clips that make up his top events of the week.

&quot;Kristy at the news desk&quot;, presented by Kristy Warner, was a parody news report, similar to the long-running &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment of the American sketch show, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (replaced &quot;Carrie at the news desk&quot; from 17 August 2009 onwards).

&quot;Judith Lucy&quot; presented by Judith Lucy. Lucy delivers a satirical and comedic commentary on a personal or newsworthy topic (Replaced &quot;Hughsey!&quot; from 17 August 2009 onwards).

Throughout each show, Rove will interview several celebrity guests. Each interview ends with a segment titled &quot;Public Probe&quot; where he will ask his guests five different questions that have been posted to the website by the general public. At the end of the interview, Rove would usually spruik the product or event that guest was promoting, and the words &quot;The Plug&quot; will appear on the screen.

Throughout the course of the show, a variety of other segments are shown, presented by members of the &quot;Rove&quot; cast:

* Kevin Rudd PM was a small dramatic-comedy mini-series about the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. The series involves video news clips of Rudd that are spliced together.

Two other segments are occasionally shown, not necessarily every week.

* Hamish &amp; Andy Comedians Hamish Blake and Andy Lee presented a pre-recorded report, frequently on location overseas.
* Ryan Shelton also presented a segment known as Philosophisationing with Ryan Shelton.

The final segment of the show was &quot;What Have We Learnt?&quot;, in which each cast member, and usually each guest, give a humourus example of what they have learned during the week. Peter Helliar always answers last and ends with &quot;and you can read all about it in my new book...&quot;

The show will usually end with a live performance from a band in the studio, and McManus will end the show by saying his trademark line &quot;Say hi to your mum for me!&quot; Starting in 2005 the band performs before the closing credits. In previous years the credits would roll while the band performed. In 2006, Rove had a house band, which may have been the same band as the main act, or an Australian band of much smaller stature than the main act. They would play live music when returning from ad breaks.

===Former show elements===
* &quot;20 bucks in 20 seconds&quot; was a titled segment at the end of an interview with a guest where Rove would ask questions for twenty seconds. Once the time was up, Rove would always ask the question: &quot;Who would you turn gay for?&quot; (if the guest was openly gay, the question would be changed to &quot;Who would you turn straight for?&quot;). A popular solution to this question was to respond &quot;I&#x27;d turn gay for you, Rove&quot;. In a particular episode featuring known prankster and member of The Chaser team, Chas Licciardello, Licciardello expressed his annoyance that everyone answered &quot;I&#x27;d turn gay for you, Rove&quot; but that nobody ever followed up on it. He then leapt on Rove and French kissed him, before licking Rove on the face. This segment was again replaced by &quot;Final Five&quot; in 2009, and halfway through the 2009 series, it changed once again and became the &quot;Public Probe&quot;, where Rove would ask the guest 5 questions submitted online from the public.
* &quot;All That Glitters&quot;: Rove, along with regular presenters and guest artists perform a scripted radio play with the help of a Foley artist live on the show.
* &quot;Amazing Talents&quot;: Viewers with &#x27;amazing&#x27; (or just plain bizarre) &#x27;talents&#x27; are brought to the studio and given a few minutes to display their skills. This could be balancing lawn furniture, or nailing a fork into each nostril. This is comparable to the &quot;Stupid Human Tricks&quot; segment on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.
* &quot;Carrie at the Newsdesk&quot; was a parody news report, similar to the long-running &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment of the American sketch show, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The segment had been presented by a variety of personalities in Bickmore&#x27;s absence. While on maternity leave in 2007, Bickmore was replaced by Jane Hall and Meshel Laurie. In 2008, Bert Newton and Myf Warhurst have presented the segment when Bickmore was ill.
* &quot;Final Five&quot; where he will ask his guests five different questions and often include their opinion on something that has happened during the week in popular culture (such as asking Alan Cumming what he thought of Matthew Newton&#x27;s bum in &quot;&quot;). The last question was always a visual question where Rove will show the interviewee an unusual image and ask them to say what they think about the image.
* &quot;Flick Your Switch&quot;: The show broadcasts a live video shot of an area of an Australian city. Rove then asks those residents of the area who are watching the show and willing to respond to flick their houselights on and off, sometimes to give answers to questions.
This segment started in 2004 when Rove pointed a camera at Kirribilli House and asked the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, to flick his light switch if he was willing to be interviewed on the show. When the desired result was not achieved, Rove then asked the neighbours to flick their switch if they would try to help get Howard on the show. On 19 April 2005, Rove succeeded in his goal of getting someone at Kirribilli house to flick their switch. A special ferry filled with participants in a dress-up competition for the show stopped on Sydney Harbour outside Kirribilli House, the passengers chanting &quot;Flick your switch&quot;. Rove and viewers were surprised to see the lights flick. It was neither Mr or Mrs Howard as they were both on an international visit at the time. It is believed that it was one of Howard&#x27;s children or an aide.
The show &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Your Toothbrush&quot; had a similar element for the second season involving the audience flashing their house lights on and off at a prescribed moment. A camera in a mystery location would search for someone taking part, thus selecting him or her to play a game that involved throwing things out of his or her windows.
* &quot;Guides&quot;: Rove, Pete and Corinne created guides to help people. The guides they did were: &quot;Guide To Having A Baby&quot;, &quot;Guide To Driving&quot;, &quot;Guide To Breaking Up&quot;, &quot;Guide To House Hunting&quot; and &quot;Guide To Job Interviews&quot;.
* &quot;Hang Up, Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot;: Rove called a regular audience member from a different time zone, and tried to engage in conversation. However, during the call Peter Helliar revealed random instructions from the keypad of an oversized phone prop. For example, &quot;Sing your words&quot;, or &quot;Make the live-lister say the word &quot;bucket&quot;&quot;. If Peter pulled out &quot;Hang up&quot;, Rove hung up and ended the call without saying goodbye or even finishing his sentence.
* &quot;Hot Topic&quot;: A vox populi segment, in which purportedly random people were asked their opinions. These answers were evidently scripted, and many of their responses included references to Network Ten shows.
* &quot;Hughesy!&quot; was presented by Dave Hughes. Hughes delivered a satirical and comedic commentary on a personal or newsworthy topic.
* &quot;Hughesy Loses It&quot;: Dave Hughes engaged in a weekly rant about something trivial, this is very similar to Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Dave&#x27;s Raves&quot; a years prior by Dave Lawson on Sarvo. He often used the catchphrase &#x27;Seriously!&#x27;
* &quot;Help Me Hughesy!&quot;: Dave Hughes responded humorously to viewer questions, frequently with taped reports.
* &quot;I Want My Stuff Back&quot;: Rove helps a &#x27;Live Lister&#x27; receive back property that they have lent to someone.
* &quot;It Takes You&quot;: Parody of &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, in which Rove picked a member of the audience to sing with a celebrity. This segment appeared once on 3 June 2007. The professional was Dean Geyer.
* &quot;&quot;: Viewers can register their name, address and various other details on the show&#x27;s website to join the &quot;Live List&quot;. A broadcast team will occasionally visit a viewer (the first the viewer knows about it is when they see the front of their house live on television). What happens from then on varies greatly—from performing a quick two-minute interview live from their house, to being sent away to perform a certain task (usually to win a prize), sometimes being sent as far away as Fiji, New York City or the United Kingdom.
* &quot;My Charader&quot;: Charades. The title is a play on the song &quot;My Sharona&quot; by The Knack. The game is hosted by Rove and involves two teams. Before Corinne Grant left the show, she and a guest would play on one team, and Peter Helliar and a guest on the other team.
* &quot;Not So Frequently Asked Questions&quot;: Rove, Peter and Corinne are asked questions that aren&#x27;t asked very often. This usually ends with a pre-recorded skit.
* &quot;The Pentagon of Probable Embarrassment&quot;: Rove has an audience member spin a wheel with a one in five chance of winning $5000, although the other four items on the wheel are repelling. Other items on the wheel included: &quot;Breakfast in your pants&quot;, &quot;Kiss Pete&#x27;s Grandma&quot;, &quot;Soup on your head&quot;, &quot;Eat a Fish Eye&quot; and &quot;Mega-Wedgie&quot;.
* &quot;Petesclusive&quot;: Peter Helliar will chat to a &#x27;guest&#x27; (celebrity or world figure) who has recently been involved in a famous story or scandal. Helliar&#x27;s guests are a photograph of the famous person with his or her mouth digitally replaced by Rove&#x27;s mouth. This is similar to a regular bit on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.
* &quot;Ron&#x27;s Review&quot;: 78-year-old Ron Steward reviewed a new movie and a rating out of 5 stars. &quot;Ron&#x27;s Review&quot; occurred around every three weeks. Peter Helliar also reviews the same movie. The main humorous appeal of this segment was the fact that Ron was quite an elderly man which led to a variety of jokes regarding Ron&#x27;s age, which, although many were at his own expense, he appeared to take in good humor. Another humorous part of the segment is Ron&#x27;s ever-recurring rating of three-and-a-half stars (out of 5). In 2006 Rove conducted a semi-humorous campaign to have Ron nominated for the best newcomer Logie Award.
* &quot;Rove&#x27;s Audience&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;: Parody of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, where Rove plucked a member of the audience and put them into a performance utilising a particular talent. Peter Helliar, Dave Hughes and a celebrity guest acted as judges. This segment has only occurred twice.
* &quot;Roving with Rove&quot;: A pre-recorded vox populi segment in which McManus asks people in street for their thoughts.
* &quot;Rydeas&quot;: Comedian Ryan Shelton presented a new invention or idea, often incorporating the syllable &#x27;Ry&#x27;.
* &quot;So Rove&#x27;s Audience Thinks They Can Dance&quot;: Parody of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, where Rove picks a member of the audience, dresses him or her in an unusual costume, and forces him/her to dance. Like &quot;It Takes You&quot;, this segment has only appeared once.
* &quot;Sex Office&quot;: a drama/sitcom style television show set in the 1970s, in which everyone in the office (except one individual) is engaging in frequent casual sex.
* &quot;Tell Us Where To Go&quot;: At a viewer&#x27;s request, Corinne Grant was sent on location somewhere in Australia to witness a local event, to see a local landmark or to meet a local personality. The segment is pre-recorded and introduced by Rove and Corinne in front of a large map of Australia (without Tasmania) lowered onto the stage. At the end of the segment, Corinne gives Rove a present from the adventure (something sexual or inappropriate or both), and a magnet is placed on the drop-down map approximately where the location was. Due to Australia being very closely populated on the eastern coast, and southeastern corner in particular, the &quot;approximate&quot; placement of the magnets has been evermore loosely interpreted. This segment was dropped with the departure of Grant in 2005.
* &quot;Two Minutes at Your House&quot;: In addition to being chosen to participate in stunts and contests, &quot;Live List-ers&quot;, as they are referred to, may be visited by the show&#x27;s camera crew for a live crossover to their house lasting about two minutes. In reality, these segments are often well beyond the suggested two minutes, as the timer doesn&#x27;t commence counting down until the person has been verified to be at home, and Rove tells the clock to start. If a particular story isn&#x27;t finished, pet not shown, or talent not displayed, the segment will often continue even if the timer has expired. Some broadcasts have hinted at prior planning of the segment.
* &quot;What&#x27;s Hot, What&#x27;s Not&quot;: Rove would describe something that is hot (popular) at the moment and compare it with something that is not (e.g. &quot;What&#x27;s Hot&quot; – Lamborghinis. &quot;What&#x27;s Not&quot; – Lamb Bikinis. &quot;What&#x27;s Hot&quot; – &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s Not&quot; – Dentist Archives).
* &quot;What the...?&quot;: Rove receives viewer submissions of objects that might make one say &quot;What the...?&quot; The submissions could be newspaper clippings, DVD boxes, photographs of odd signs or animals doing inappropriate things to each other. Many are mistakes of translation from foreign languages or other unintentional humor. This segment was abandoned in 2007.
* &quot;Who&#x27;s in the Swivel Chair?&quot;: A celebrity was pushed around the studio on a swivel chair. Each week the name of the celebrity was announced by Bruce Mansfield.
* &quot;Words that sound better when said by Dave&quot;: Dave Callan recited certain words and names which, owing to his thick Irish accent, sound quaint to the Australian audience. The sketch was abandoned when Callan left after the first series in 2000. Some of Callan&#x27;s famous words include: &#x27;trousers&#x27;, &#x27;haberdashery&#x27;, &#x27;Archbishop Desmond Tutu&#x27; and &#x27;man-boob&#x27;.
* Joke credits: At the end of every episode there were fake credits shown with the real credits. There was a common theme for the credits each week.
* Song parodies: Rove performs a parody of a recent music video. He has parodied Shannon Noll&#x27;s &quot;What About Me&quot;, Missy Higgins&#x27;s &quot;Scar&quot;, Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; and Sophie Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;.
* Sketches: Rove, Pete and Corinne Grant performed three sketches on the show together. The first one was about a sleepover, the second was about wheelchair rugby and the third was about horse racing.

==Ratings==
The show has sometimes struggled in the ratings. This was most obvious in the ratings for the final show of 2005, which was broadcast on 22 November. The show gave away six cars, and had media heavyweights Bert Newton, Jerry Seinfeld and Kath &amp; Kim as guests. The show rated 19th for the day, with only 797,000 viewers nationwide.

On 16 May 2006, the ratings peaked over a million for the first time since 2002 when 1,040,762 viewers watched nationwide. This episode involved an intruder entering the Big Brother house live during the show. The final episode for 2006 attracted only 700,000 viewers nationally. This wasn&#x27;t intended to be the final episode, but it eventuated as the result of the death of McManus&#x27; wife Belinda Emmett.

The first episode of the revamped series, which began 1 April 2007, attracted 1,693,000 viewers nationwide, and was the highest-rated program for the day. For the second episode of the season, which aired on 8 April, viewership fell to 999,000. The third episode was shown on 22 April, achieving around 1,073,000 viewers. Since then, the show has consistently rated above 1 million viewers nationally.

Rove&#x27;s final show for 2007 featured then Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd, as well as Australian Greens leader Bob Brown, comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actor Jason Donovan. It was watched by 1.368 million viewers. The season premiere for 2008, broadcast on 30 March, only attracted 777,000 viewers.

Eight hundred and fifty-five thousand viewers watched the 2009 return of Rove, up nearly 100,000 viewers on the previous year. Ratings frequently average 800,000 to 1 million viewers.

==International broadcasters==
In 2004, the show began broadcasting on TV3 in New Zealand at a late-night time slot. The show quickly gained a following and was given a primetime slot on Friday nights (8:30pm–9:30pm). It was not broadcast live in New Zealand (in spite of its former title &quot;Rove Live&quot;); rather, it was televised five days after the Australian broadcast.

==Controversy==
On 28 June 2009, McManus interviewed Sacha Baron Cohen (appearing in character as Brüno Gehard). During the course of the interview, Brüno joked that &quot;I hear [Cohen&#x27;s] wife gets less sex than Katie Holmes&quot;, a reference to long-time rumours of her then-husband Tom Cruise being gay. However, when televised, the words &quot;Katie Holmes&quot; were censored. A further joke at the expense of Holmes towards the end of the interview was not even televised. Throughout the interview, Brüno made numerous jokes about other celebrities, especially Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These jokes were not similarly censored.

==Other media ==

===Radio===

Rove, Peter and Corinne hosted a radio program originating from FOX FM in Melbourne for Austereo&#x27;s Today Network, as well as selected regional stations, until 2004. It was initially known as &quot;Saturday Morning Rove&quot;. It was then called &quot;Rove Live Radio&quot;.

===Soundtracks===
Two soundtracks were released by Sony featuring musical performances from the show, one in November 2001 and the second in November 2002. Both albums peaked within the ARIA top 40.

<text>A kvutza, kvutzah, kevutza or kevutzah ( &quot;group&quot;) is a form of cooperative settlement that was founded in the Second Aliyah and developed in the Third Aliyah, its principles are based on the existence of a cooperative, communal, small and intimate group.

The settlers of the group lived in full cooperation (a common fund for expenses and income, without private property) and without external control (warehouses etc).

== Ideology ==
The &quot;Kvutzas&quot; were influenced by the socialist and communist principles and thoughts. This influence caused a surge of settlements, built on community ownership and agriculture. later, most of the Kvutza&#x27;s turned into Kibbutz&#x27;s.

== History ==
First there were &quot;kvutzot&quot; (plural of kvutza) in the sense of groups of young people with similar ideals living and working together; and after 1909 and for many years to follow, in the sense of collective settlements created by such groups. The kvutza collective settlement was distinguished from the &quot;kibbutz&quot; settlement in that it intended to remain small and mainly agricultural, whereas the larger kibbutzim were intended to expand with agriculture, industry and other productive pursuits. Later, as the distinction disappeared, most kvutzot were renamed kibbutzim. Notable example: Degania Alef.

There are various plurals in English: several &quot;kvutza&quot; may be called &quot;kvutzas&quot;, &quot;kvutzot&quot; or &quot;kvutzoth&quot;

<doc id="1128211" wikidata="Q419995" url="?curid=1128211" title="Amiloride">
<text>Amiloride, sold under the trade name Midamor among others, is a medication typically used with other medications to treat high blood pressure or swelling due to heart failure or cirrhosis of the liver. Amiloride is classified as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Amiloride is often used together with another diuretic, such as a thiazide or loop diuretic. It is taken by mouth. Onset of action is about two hours and it lasts for about a day.
Common side effects include high blood potassium, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and headache. The risk of high blood potassium is greater in those with kidney problems, diabetes, and those who are older. Amiloride blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the late distal tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct of the nephron, which both reduces absorption of sodium ion from the lumen of the nephron and reduces excretion of potassium ion into the lumen.
Amiloride was developed in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.
==Medical uses==

Amiloride may be used in combination with a thiazide diuretic for treatment of high blood pressure or (less commonly) in combination with a loop diuretic for treatment of heart failure. The potassium-sparing effects of amiloride offset the low blood potassium (hypokalemia) that is often induced by thiazides or loop diuretics, which is of particular importance in people for whom maintaining a normal level of potassium is critically important. For example, people that are taking &quot;Digitalis&quot; (i.e. digoxin) are at higher risk for changes in heart rhythm if their potassium levels get too high. The 2017 clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines list amiloride as a &quot;secondary&quot; oral antihypertensive, with minimal efficacy. For people with resistant hypertension, already taking a thiazide diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a calcium channel blocker, the addition of amiloride (or spironolactone) was better at reducing blood pressure than adding a beta-blocker (bisoprolol) or an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin). When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, the addition of amiloride had positive effects on blood pressure and blood sugar tolerance. Amiloride may therefore be useful for preventing the metabolic side effects of thiazide diuretics, allowing for the use of higher thiazide doses (in line with how they were originally studied).

Amiloride is the treatment of choice for Liddle phenotype, which is characterized by high blood pressure, low blood potassium, and metabolic alkalosis in conjunction with a low plasma renin activity and a low aldosterone. Some people with the Liddle phenotype have Liddle syndrome, which involves a genetic mutation resulting in upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), located in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney. Because Liddle phenotype usually involves an upregulation of ENaC channels, leading to retention of sodium and water and to hypokalemia, amiloride is useful as an ENaC channel inhibitor due to its promotion of sodium excretion and its potassium-sparing effects, restoring potassium to normal levels.

Amiloride can be used as a monotherapy (single-drug therapy) or an adjunctive therapy alongside other diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) for the treatment of ascites and edema (swelling) due to cirrhosis of the liver. The 2012 clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) states that amiloride can be used to treat ascites in place of spironolactone if it isn&#x27;t tolerated (e.g. due to the side effect of gynecomastia), though amiloride isn&#x27;t a preferred drug due to cost and lack of efficacy.

===Specific populations===
====Diabetics====
People with diabetes are at higher risk for kidney problems, which increases their risk for hyperkalemia (high blood potassium). The use of amiloride in people with diabetes requires careful potassium and kidney function monitoring to prevent toxicity. Amiloride must be discontinued for at least 3 days prior to glucose tolerance testing, due to the risk for fatal hyperkalemia.

====Poor kidney function====
People with poor kidney function (e.g. blood urea nitrogen &gt;30 mg/dL, or serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL) are at high risk for hyperkalemia.

====Lactation====
There is no data on the use of amiloride in women that are breastfeeding. While diuretics can make lactation difficult, it is unlikely that amiloride would induce this effect in the absence of other diuretics.

====Pregnancy====
Data from the use of amiloride in animals suggests that it does not pose a risk to the developing fetus. However, when used in combination with the drug acetazolamide during the process of organ formation, amiloride increases the risk for kidney and ureter abnormalities. Limited human data from use during pregnancy suggests an association with a specific congenital penis abnormality if taken during the first trimester, as well as a risk for mild intrauterine growth restriction if taken throughout pregnancy.

==Contraindications==
Amiloride is contraindicated in people with kidney problems (e.g. anuria, acute or chronic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy), elevated blood potassium (≥5.5 mEq/L), or people that are hypersensitive to amiloride or any ingredients within the specific formulation. Use is also contraindicated in people that are already taking potassium-sparing drugs (e.g. spironolactone and triamterene) or who are taking potassium supplements (e.g. potassium chloride) in most circumstances.

==Adverse effects==
Amiloride is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects of the use of amiloride include elevated blood potassium, mild skin rashes, headaches, and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, flatulence, and abdominal pain). Mild symptoms of high blood potassium concentrations include unusual skin sensations, muscle weakness, or fatigue, but more severe symptoms such as flaccid paralysis of the limbs, slow heart rate, and even shock can occur.

==Overdose==
There exists no overdose data on amiloride in humans, though it is expected than an overdose would produce effects consistent with its therapeutic effects; e.g. dehydration due to over-diuresis, and electrolyte disturbances related to hyperkalemia. It is unknown if amiloride can be dialyzed off, and no specific antidote against it exists. Treatment is generally supportive, though hyperkalemia can be treated.

== Interactions ==

Amiloride may have important drug-drug interactions when combined with other medications that also increase potassium levels in the blood, leading to hyperkalemia. For example, the combination of amiloride with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonists like losartan, may lead to high levels of potassium in the blood, requiring frequent monitoring.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
====Diuresis====
Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with an IC50 around 0.1 μM, indicating potent blockade. Antagonism of ENaC thereby inhibits sodium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the nephron. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, and reduces potassium excretion. The drug is often used in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic to counteract with a potassium-losing effect. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium concentration in the blood) can occur. The risk of developing hyperkalemia is increased in patients who are also taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, other potassium-sparing diuretics, or any potassium-containing supplements.

====Miscellaneous====
A fraction of the effects of amiloride is inhibition of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels in the inner medullary collecting duct.

Amiloride has a second action on the heart, blocking Na+/H+ exchangers such as sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1 (NHE-1).

Amiloride also blocks the Na+/H+ antiporter on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells in the nephron, abolishing more than 80% of the action of angiotensin II on the secretion of hydrogen ions in proximal tubule cells. Amiloride is not an angiotensin II receptor blocker (like losartan, for example). The Na-H transporter is also found in the Jejunum of the small intestine, as a result, amiloride also blocks the reabsorption of Na, and thereby water in the intestines.

Amiloride is considered to be a reversible, pan-acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitor that prevents the transient flow of ions but not the sustained flow of ions. ASICs are members of the ENaC family of protein channels, and are found in the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, and the skin. Broadly, ASICs are involved in harm detection, (pH changes specifically), and touch.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
Amiloride has an oral bioavailability of 50%, meaning that about 50% of an oral dose is absorbed into the blood stream. Coadministration with food reduces the amount of amiloride that is absorbed by the body by about 30%, though it does not affect the rate of absorption. However, taking amiloride with food helps to reduce the incidence of its gastrointestinal side effects. After being taken, amiloride&#x27;s diuretic effect occurs within 2 hours, with peak diuresis within 6–10 hours. The diuretic effects of amiloride persist for about 24 hours after administration.

====Distribution====
Amiloride cross the placenta and distributes into breast milk &quot;in vivo&quot;.

====Metabolism====
Amiloride is not metabolized by the liver. In comparison, the ENaC inhibitor triamterene is metabolized by the liver.

====Excretion====
About 50% of amiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, while around 40% is excreted in the feces (likely drug that wasn&#x27;t absorbed). The half-life of amiloride in humans is between 6 and 9 hours, which may be prolonged in people with poor kidney function.

===Pharmacogenomics===
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein NEDD4L may impact how amiloride affects a person&#x27;s blood pressure in cases of hypertension (high blood pressure).

==Chemistry==

Amiloride is a pyrazinoylguanidine, composed of a substituted pyrazine ring structure with a carbonylguanidinium substituent. Amiloride&#x27;s pKa is 8.67, which is due to the guanidinium group. In high pH (alkaline, low hydrogen concentration) environments, the guanidinium group is deprotonated and the compound is rendered neutral, depleting its activity on sodium channels. Amiloride, as a pure substance, is highly fluorescent, with excitation wavelengths at 215, 288, and 360 nm, emitting light at 420 nm.
==History==
Amiloride was first synthesized and discovered by the Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories in the late 1960s. The drug was discovered as part of a screening process of chemicals that reversed the effects of mineralocorticoids &quot;in vivo&quot;. Amiloride was the only drug in the screen that was capable of causing the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) without a concomitant urinary excretion of potassium (kaliuresis). Thousands of amiloride analogues have been studied since its initial discovery, which have been used to study the effects of sodium transporters.

Amiloride was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 5, 1981.

==Society and culture==
It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

Amiloride is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s list of banned substances, as it is considered a masking agent. Diuretics like amiloride act as masking agents by reducing the concentration of other doping agents due to promoting diuresis, increasing the total volume of the urine. The list includes other potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene and spironolactone. In 2008, amiloride and the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene were found in 3% of positive diuretic doping samples.

** Midamor (U.S.)
* Co-amilozide (amiloride hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide)
* Co-amilofruse (amiloride hydrochloride with furosemide)
* Amiloride hydrochloride with cyclopenthiazide
* Amiloride hydrochloride with bumetanide

==Research==
Amiloride is an inhibitor of NHE-1, which helps to maintain normal pH within cells. Cancer cells in leukemia, a type of blood cancer, have higher pH compared to normal cells. Amiloride affects the splicing and regulation of multiple genes involved in cancer, though they do not appear to be directly related to its effects on pH. Amiloride has been tested &quot;in vitro&quot; as an adjunct to the anticancer drug imatinib, which appeared to show a synergistic effect. Modified versions of amiloride, known as 5&#x27;-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), are being studied for the treatment of leukemia.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder due to a mutation in the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene, which encodes for the CFTR chloride channel. There is evidence that suggests that the molecular target of amiloride, ENaC, is also implicated in cystic fibrosis due to its effects on mucus in the lungs. Aerosolized formulations of amiloride have been tested in clinical trials, though long-term clinical trials have failed to show much utility. Due to its short duration of action, it was thought that longer-acting ENaC inhibitors may prove more effective. However, longer-acting ENaC inhibitors (i.e. benzamil) have also failed clinical trials, despite an improvement in both the solubility and potency of the drugs. A third generation amiloride analogue (N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carbonyl)-N&#x27;-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl-guanidine methanesulfonate, research name &quot;552-02&quot;), with better pharmacokinetic properties, is being studied.

Pain induced by exposure to acid is attenuated by amiloride in human trials, which may indicate a role for amiloride in the treatment of pain in the future.

<doc id="1128224" wikidata="Q143610" url="?curid=1128224" title="Commonwealth Bay">
<text>Commonwealth Bay is an open bay about 48 km (30 mi) wide at the entrance between Point Alden and Cape Gray in Antarctica. It was discovered in 1912 by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under Douglas Mawson, who established the main base of the expedition at Cape Denison at the head of the bay. The bay was named by the Expedition after the Commonwealth of Australia.
==Katabatic wind==
Commonwealth Bay is listed in both the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; and the Eighth Edition of the &quot;National Geographic Atlas&quot; as the windiest place on Earth, with winds regularly exceeding per hour and an average annual wind speed of per hour.

Storms are caused by katabatic wind, a concentrated flow of cold air moving along the steep surface of the ice shield towards the sea. The air flow is accelerated by the increasing gradient of the surface of ice and the cliff monolith at Cape Denison. In the summer there are periods of relative calm, but in the winter storms are especially strong and long lasting, and can start and end unexpectedly. An abrupt start and end to a storm might be accompanied by powerful whirlpools, and by expressive short-lived and fast-moving clouds along the coast line.

Despite the extreme weather, the coast of the Bay is an important breeding area for Antarctic petrels, emperor penguins, and Adelie penguins, which are preyed on by leopard seals.

==Penguin population crash==
From 2011 to 2016, the population of a colony of Adelie penguins living on the bay crashed from 160,000 to 10,000. A giant iceberg the size of Rome got stuck, leaving the colony effectively landlocked.

<text>Predator&#x27;s Gold, the second book in the &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot; series, is a young-adult science fiction novel written by Philip Reeve and published in 2003. In the book, Tom and Hester stumble across the ice raft of Anchorage.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;Predator&#x27;s Gold&quot; is set two years after &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;. In that time, lovers Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw have been using the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;, their deceased comrade Anna Fang&#x27;s airship, to travel across the world trading and adventuring.

===Plot summary===
Tom and Hester meet adventurer and author Nimrod Pennyroyal aboard the Airhaven, a former Traction City that converted to a floating city. Pennyroyal persuades them to take him as a passenger. They are soon pursued by airships of the Green Storm, a fanatical splinter group of the Anti-Traction League, who want the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; as they believe it was stolen from their deceased leader and friend to Tom and Hester, Anna Fang. Despite evading the airships, the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; is damaged and drifts helplessly over the Ice Wastes. They are rescued by Anchorage, which was once a thriving Traction City that relied primarily upon trade, but had recently been devastated by an excavated biological weapon that killed most of the inhabitants. The survivors have set a course for North America, which is believed to be a radioactive wasteland since the Sixty Minute War. The city is ruled by the young margravine Freya Rasmussen, who treats all three of them as honoured guests and appoints Pennyroyal as the city&#x27;s chief navigator because of his past experiences (detailed in his book &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;) traveling in America. As Anchorage&#x27;s harbormaster works to repair the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;, Hester becomes jealous of Tom&#x27;s growing closeness to Freya, and is also disturbed by the sightings of &quot;ghosts&quot; in the city. Eventually she sees Tom kissing Freya, and flies away from the city in the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;. Thereafter, Hester sells Anchorage&#x27;s course to Piotr Masgard, the leader of the &quot;Huntsmen&quot; of the Traction City of Arkangel, who intends to capture the city through an airship invasion; rather than accepting money as payment for this information, she insists that when Arkangel eats Anchorage, Tom be returned to her. As she returns to the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;, however, she is drugged and kidnapped by a Green Storm informant.

Hester is taken to Rogue&#x27;s Roost, an island south of Greenland, where the Green Storm have converted Anna Fang&#x27;s body into a Stalker. The commander, Sathya, hopes to restore Fang&#x27;s memories by showing her Hester, but the resurrected Fang doesn&#x27;t recognise her nor herself. Sathya reveals that, according to her intelligence, Hester&#x27;s father was Thaddeus Valentine.

Tom realizes that Pennyroyal never went to America, and based his entire book on an old explorer&#x27;s map in the Reykjavík library. On his way to reveal Pennyroyal&#x27;s deception to the chief engineer, Tom finds out that the &quot;ghosts&quot; sighted around Anchorage are thieves, operating out of a parasitic submarine-like limpet attached to the bottom of the city, who call themselves the Lost Boys and work out of a larger group in the sunken city of Grimsby. With their secret discovered, they kidnap Tom and leave the city. Tom develops a sort of friendship with a reluctant Lost Boy, Caul, on their trip to Grimsby. Caul tells him that the city is ruled by &quot;Uncle&quot;, a man who founded it as a base of thieves and keeps the Lost Boys under constant surveillance.

When they arrive in Grimsby, Tom is taken to see Uncle, who tells him there is something valuable in Rogues&#x27; Roost which he wants Tom to steal for him. In return, Tom will have the chance to rescue Hester. Tom climbs a ladder up the rocky cliffs to infiltrate the base, but he is soon discovered and reunited with Hester in her cell. Realising that Uncle sent Tom to die as a diversion, Caul prematurely detonates the charges the Lost Boys were positioning inside the Roost, sabotaging the operation, but saving Tom and Hester. In the confusion, most of the Lost Boys make their way to the chamber where the Stalker Fang is kept, but the Stalker easily kills them all. She then pursues Tom and Hester into the island hangar where the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; is kept, but lets them escape when she seemingly recognises Tom, and then takes command of the Green Storm forces from Sathya.

In Grimsby, after Uncle severely beats Caul for his betrayal, then leaves him to die by hanging, and informs the younger man that he knew Anna Fang when he was younger. Fang was a slave in Arkangel, but Uncle began to love her and released her. She betrayed him by building an airship and escaping from slavery. After Uncle was disowned by his family, he built Grimsby to make sure that nobody kept a secret from him ever again. Uncle wanted to retrieve Fang from Rogue&#x27;s Roost to reprogram her to become his slave. Caul is saved by fellow Lost Boy Gargle, who wanted to repay Caul&#x27;s kindness to him. Gargle gives Caul the Reykjavik map that Uncle had all along, and sends him back to Anchorage on a limpet.

Freya catches Pennyroyal secretly broadcasting a radio message asking for someone to come and get him off of Anchorage, and he subsequently admits to her that his claims of traveling to America were all lies. Arkangel chases Anchorage, leading to the Huntsmen led by Masgard capturing Anchorage and leaving it helpless on the ice to be eaten. Tom and Hester return to the city, where Pennyroyal has evaded capture. Hester sends Tom to hide, and later liberates the inhabitants, killing Masgard and the Hunstmen in the process. Tom confronts Pennyroyal, who knows that Hester sold Anchorage to Masgard, but doesn&#x27;t tell Tom. Attempting to scare Tom off, Pennyroyal accidentally shoots Tom in the chest. He then steals the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; and escapes. Arkangel still pursues Anchorage, but becomes trapped over thin ice, leading Anchorage to drift on the ocean on an ice floe.

With the revelation that Pennyroyal is a fraud, the inhabitants lose hope in the salvation of their city, until Caul arrives with the Reykjavik map, and convinces them to continue. Meanwhile, Pennyroyal escapes to the Hunting Ground, and soon publishes a book reimagining the events of Anchorage&#x27;s flight west, with himself as the hero and exposing the Lost Boys. Arkangel is evacuated and eventually sinks to the bottom of the ocean. In Asia, the Green Storm, under the leadership of the Stalker Fang, topples the old Anti-Traction League. Anchorage eventually makes it to North America, and finds enough parts of it have greenery for them to settle. Tom recovers from his wound, but is still very weak. Hester takes comfort in the knowledge that the city will be secret and safe in this new land, and is pleased to discover that she is pregnant.

<text>Amantadine, sold under the brand name Gocovri among others, is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus, though its use for the latter is no longer recommended because of widespread drug resistance. It is also used for a variety of other uses. The drug is taken by mouth.
Amantadine has a mild side-effect profile. Common neurological side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, and confusion. Because of its effects on the central nervous system (CNS), it should be combined cautiously with additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Given that it is cleared by the kidneys, amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease. Due to its anticholinergic effects, it should be taken with caution by those with enlarged prostates or glaucoma.
The pharmacology of amantadine is complex. It acts as a sigma σ1 receptor agonist, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor negative allosteric modulator, dopaminergic agent, and weak NMDA receptor antagonist, among other actions. The precise mechanism of action of its therapeutic effects in the treatment of CNS disorders is unclear. The antiviral mechanism of action is inhibition of the influenza virus A M2 proton channel, which prevents endosomal escape (i.e., the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm). Amantadine is an adamantane derivative and is related to memantine and rimantadine.
Amantadine was first used for the treatment of influenza A. After its antiviral properties were initially reported in 1963, amantadine received approval for prophylaxis against the influenza virus A in 1966. In 1968, its antiparkinsonian effects were serendipitously discovered. In 1973, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In 2020, the extended-release formulation was approved for use in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.

==Medical uses==
Amantadine was initially developed to prevent replication of the influenza A virus. Its main clinical use today is treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Other uses include treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects, motor fluctuations during levodopa therapy in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, traumatic brain injury, and autistic spectrum disorders.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Amantadine is used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease-related dyskinesia and drug-induced parkinsonism syndromes. Amantadine may be used alone or in combination with another anti-Parkinson&#x27;s or anticholinergic drug. The specific symptoms targeted by amantadine therapy are dyskinesia and rigidity. The extended release amantadine formulation is commonly used to treat dyskinesias in people receiving levodopa therapy for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. A 2003 Cochrane review had concluded evidence was insufficient to prove the safety or efficacy of amantadine to treat dyskinesia.

In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported amantadine is not effective as a stand-alone parkinsonian therapy, but recommended it could be used in combination therapy with levodopa.

===Influenza A===
Amantadine is not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United States. Amantadine has no effect preventing or treating influenza B infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) during the 2008–2009 flu season.

The U.S. CDC guidelines recommend only neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. The CDC recommends against amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A infections.

Similarly, the 2011 WHO virology report showed all tested H1N1 influenza A viruses were resistant to amantadine. WHO guidelines recommend against use of M2 inhibitors for influenza A. The continued high rate of resistance observed in laboratory testing of influenza A has reduced the priority of M2 resistance testing.

A 2014 Cochrane review did not find evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine used for the prevention or treatment of influenza A.

===Extrapyramidal symptoms===
An extended-release formulation of amantadine is used to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The WHO recommends the use of amantadine as a combination therapy to reduce levodopa side effects.

===Off-label uses===
====Fatigue in multiple sclerosis====
A 2007 Cochrane literature review concluded that no overall evidence supports the use of amantadine in treating fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A follow-up 2012 Cochrane review stated that some amantadine-induced improvement in fatigue may occur in some people with MS. Despite multiple control trials that have also demonstrated improvements in subjective and objective ratings of fatigue, no final conclusion has been drawn regarding its effectiveness.

Consensus guidelines from the German Multiple Sclerosis Society (GMSS) in 2006 state that amantadine produces moderate improvement in subjective fatigue, problem solving, memory, and concentration. Thus, in 2006, GMSS guidelines recommended the use of amantadine in MS-related fatigue.

In the UK, NICE recommends considering amantadine for MS fatigue.

====Disorders of consciousness====
Disorders of consciousness (DoC) include coma, vegetative state (VS), and minimally conscious state (MCS). Amantadine has been shown to increase the rate of emergence from a MCS, defined by consistent demonstration of interactive communication and functional objective use. In traumatic brain injury patients in the intensive care unit, amantadine has also been shown in various randomized control trials to increase the rate of functional recovery and arousal, particularly in the time period immediately following an injury. Also, significantly improved consciousness has been reported in patients treated for nontraumatic cases of DoC, such as in the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and hypoxic encephalopathy. In 2018, the American Academy of Neurology updated treatment guidelines on the use of amantadine for patients with prolonged DoC, recommending the use of amantadine (100–200mg b.i.d.) for adults with DoC 4 to 16 weeks after injury to support early functional recovery and reduce disability.

====Brain injury recovery====
In various studies, amantadine and memantine have been shown to accelerate the rate of recovery from a brain injury. The time-limited window following a brain injury is characterized by neuroplasticity, or the capacity of neurons in the brain to adapt and compensate after injury. Thus, physiatrists often start patients on amantadine as soon as impairments are recognized. Some case reports also show improved functional recovery with amantadine treatment occurring years after the initial brain injury. Evidence is insufficient to determine if the functional gains are a result of effects through the dopamine or norepinephrine pathways. Some patients may benefit from direct dopamine stimulation with amantadine, while others may benefit more from other stimulants that act more on the norepinephrine pathway, such as methylphenidate. If treatment with amantadine improves long-term outcomes or simply accelerates recovery is unclear. Nonetheless, amantadine-induced acceleration of recovery reduces the burden of disability, lessens health-care costs, and minimizes psychosocial stressors in patients.

==Contraindications==
Amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease, as the drug is renally cleared.

Amantadine may have anticholinergic side effects. Thus, patients with an enlarged prostate or glaucoma should use with caution.

Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated while taking amantadine. Amantadine might inhibit viral replication and reduce the efficacy of administered vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding amantadine for two weeks prior to vaccine administration and 48 hours afterward.

==Side effects==
Amantadine is generally well tolerated and has a mild side effect profile.

===Neurological===
Side effects include drowsiness (especially while driving), lightheadedness, falls, and dizziness. Patients on amantadine should avoid combination with other CNS-depressing agents, such as alcohol. Excessive alcohol usage may increase the potential for CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, and light-headedness.

Rare severe adverse effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, depression, convulsions, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. It has also been associated with disinhibited actions (gambling, sexual activity, spending, other addictions) and diminished control over compulsions.

Amantadine may cause anxiety, feeling overexcited, hallucinations, and nightmares.

===Cardiovascular===
Amantadine may cause orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and peripheral edema.

===Gastrointestinal===
Amantadine has also been associated with dry mouth and constipation.

===Skin===
Rare cases of skin rashes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and livedo reticularis have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine.

===Kidney===
Amantadine inhibits the kidney&#x27;s active-transport removal and transfer of creatinine from blood to urine, which normally occurs in the proximal tubules of the nephrons. The active-transport removal mechanism accounts for about 15% of creatinine clearance, so amantadine may increase serum creatinine concentrations 15% above normal levels and give the false impression of mild kidney disease in patients whose kidneys are actually undamaged (because kidney function is often assessed by measuring the concentration of creatinine in blood.) Also, if the patient does have kidney disease, amantadine may cause it to appear as much as 15% worse than it actually is.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Amantadine is USFDA category C for pregnancy. Teratogenic effects have been observed in humans (case reports) and animal reproduction studies. Amantadine may also be present in breast milk and negatively alter breast milk production or excretion. The decision to breastfeed during amantadine therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the drug to the mother.

==Interactions==
Amantadine may affect the CNS because of its dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The mechanisms of action are not fully known. Because of the CNS effects, caution is required when prescribing additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Thus, concurrent use of alcohol with amantadine is not recommended because of enhanced CNS depressant effects. In addition, antidopaminergic drugs such as metoclopramide and typical antipsychotics should be avoided. These interactions are likely related to opposing dopaminergic mechanisms of action, which inhibits amantadine&#x27;s anti-Parkinson effects.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
====Central nervous system disorders====
The mechanism of action of the antiparkinsonian effects of amantadine is poorly understood. The effects of amantadine in Parkinson&#x27;s disease were originally assumed to be anticholinergic or dopaminergic, but the situation soon proved more complicated than this. The pharmacodynamics of amantadine are complex, and it interacts with many different biological targets at a variety of concentrations and hence potencies.

The drug is a weak antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake. It is a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically the α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

In 1993, amantadine was found to bind to the sigma σ1 receptor with relatively high affinity (Ki = 20.25μM). In 2004, it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 7.44μM and 2.60μM, respectively) and that activation of the σ1 receptor is potentially involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations. σ1 receptor activation is one of amantadine&#x27;s more potent actions. σ1 receptor agonists enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity, modulate NMDA-stimulated dopamine release, increase dopamine release in the striatum &quot;in vivo&quot;, and decrease dopamine reuptake. As such, σ1 receptor activation may be involved in the antiparkinsonian and other central nervous system effects of amantadine.

Binding of amantadine to the NMDA receptor was first reported in 1989, and antagonism of the receptor was first reported in 1991. Despite some reports, the NMDA receptor antagonism of amantadine is probably not its primary mechanism of action. It occurs at relatively high concentrations and many of the effects of amantadine are different from those of NMDA receptor antagonists. Some of its effects, such as enhancement of dopamine release in the striatum, are even reversed by NMDA receptor antagonists, but NMDA receptor antagonism could still contribute to the effects of amantadine.

Although some publications have reported that amantadine inhibits monoamine oxidase, the drug probably does not actually inhibit this enzyme.

Amantadine shows amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects (e.g., stimulation of locomotor activity) in animals at sufficiently high doses. It has been found to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and to induce the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The concentrations needed for these effects, though, are very high and may not be therapeutically relevant. It is about 1/25th to 1/50th as potent as amphetamines. Amantadine has been found to increase dopamine levels in the striatum. It does not act as a monoaminergic activity enhancer.

Amantadine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for example of PDE1.

Amantadine has been found to increase aromatic amino acid decarboxylase expression. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of dopamine from -DOPA. An imaging study in humans found that amantadine increased AADC activity in the striatum by up to 27%.

Various additional actions of amantadine have been described.

====Influenza====


The mechanisms for amantadine&#x27;s antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects are unrelated. Amantadine targets the influenza A M2 ion channel protein. The M2 protein&#x27;s function is to allow the intracellular virus to replicate (M2 also functions as a proton channel for hydrogen ions to cross into the vesicle), and exocytose newly formed viral proteins to the extracellular space (viral shedding). By blocking the M2 channel, the virus is unable to replicate because of impaired replication, protein synthesis, and exocytosis.

Amantadine and rimantadine function in a mechanistically identical fashion, entering the barrel of the tetrameric M2 channel and blocking pore function—i.e., proton translocation.

Resistance to the drug class is a consequence of mutations to the pore-lining amino acid residues of the channel, preventing both amantadine and rimantadine from binding and inhibiting the channel in their usual way.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Amantadine is well-absorbed orally. The onset of action is usually within 48 hours when used for parkinsonian syndromes, including dyskinesia. As plasma concentrations of amantadine increase, the risk for toxicity increases.

Half-life elimination averages eight days in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Amantadine is only minimally removed by hemodialysis.

Amantadine is metabolized to a small extent (5–15%) by acetylation. It is mainly excreted (90%) unchanged in urine by kidney excretion.

==Chemistry==
Amantadine is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, which consists of an adamantane backbone with an amino group substituted at one of the four tertiary carbons. Rimantadine is a closely related adamantane derivative with similar biological properties; both target the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus.

Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) is structurally related to other adamantanes including adapromine (1-(adamantan-1-yl)propan-1-amine), bromantane (&quot;N&quot;-(4-bromophenyl)adamantan-2-amine), memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), and rimantadine (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane), among others.

==History==
===Influenza A===
Antiviral properties were first reported in 1963 at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. In this amantadine trial study, volunteer college students were exposed to a viral challenge. The group who received amantadine (100 milligrams 18 hours before viral challenge) had less Asia influenza infections than the placebo group. Amantadine received approval for the treatment of influenza virus A in adults in 1976. It was first used in West Germany in 1966. Amantadine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1968, as a prophylactic agent against Asian (H2N2) influenza and received approval for prophylactic use for influenza A in 1976.

During the 1980 influenza A epidemic, the first amantadine-resistance influenza viruses were reported. The frequency of amantadine resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1991 and 1995 was as low as 0.8%. In 2004, the resistance frequency increased to 12.3%. A year later, resistance increase significantly to 96%, 72%, and 14.5% in China, South Korea, and the United States, respectively. By 2006, 90.6% of H3N2 strains and 15.6% of H1N1 were amantadine resistant. A majority of the amantadine-resistant H3N2 isolates (98.2%) was found to contain an S31N mutation in the M2 transmembrane domain that confers resistance to amantadine. Currently, adamantane resistance is high among circulating influenza A viruses. Thus, they are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza A.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
An incidental finding in 1969 prompted investigations about amantadine&#x27;s effectiveness for treating symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. A woman with Parkinson&#x27;s disease was prescribed amantadine to treat her influenza infection and reported her cogwheel rigidity and tremors improved. She also reported that her symptoms worsened after she finished the course of amantadine. The published case report was not initially corroborated by any other instances by the medical literature or manufacturer data. A team of researchers looked at a group of 10 patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and gave them amantadine. Seven of them showed improvement, which was convincing evidence for the need of a clinical trial, which included 163 patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease; 66% experienced subjective or objective reduction of symptoms with a maximum daily dose of 200mg. Additional studies followed patients for greater lengths of time and in different combinations of neurological drugs. It was found to be a safe drug that could be used over long periods of time with few side effects as monotherapy or in combination with L-dopa or anticholinergic drugs. By April 1973, the U.S. FDA approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In 2017, the U.S. FDA approved the use of amantadine in an extended-release formulation for the treatment of dyskinesia, an adverse effect of levodopa in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
Brand names of amantadine include Gocovri, Symadine, and Symmetrel.

===Recreational use===
Recreational use of amantadine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. However, the very long duration of action of amantadine (&gt;40hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug memantine has similarly been reported.

===Veterinary misuse===
In 2005, Chinese poultry farmers were reported to have used amantadine to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, amantadine is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of amantadine. Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to amantadine, although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which block the action of viral neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of influenza virus particles. Increasing incidence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza strains (e.g., H1N1) exists, highlighting the need for new anti-influenza therapies.

In September 2015, the U.S. FDA announced the recall of Dingo Chip Twists &quot;Chicken in the Middle&quot; dog treats because the product has the potential to be contaminated with amantadine.

==Research==
===Depression===
Interest in and study of amantadine in the treatment of depression has arisen. A 2017 systematic review of off-label augmentation for treatment of unipolar depression found two open-label studies of amantadine for augmenting imipramine and found that it was effective. However, the quality of evidence was very low and no conclusions could be drawn about its effectiveness. A 2022 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of glutamatergic agents for treatment-resistant depression identified one clinical trial of amantadine for this use. Amantadine was found to be effective in treating depressive symptoms in the trial. The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of depression is unclear, but various mechanisms have been postulated. These include dopaminergic actions like indirect enhancement of dopamine release, dopamine reuptake inhibition, and D2 receptor interactions, noradrenergic actions, glutamatergic actions such as NMDA receptor antagonism, and immunomodulation, among many others.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2010 randomized clinical trial showed similar improvements in ADHD symptoms in children treated with amantadine as in those treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD-related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics.

===COVID-19===
Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of COVID-19.

<doc id="1128231" wikidata="Q430463" url="?curid=1128231" title="The Globe Sessions">
<text>The Globe Sessions is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, released on September 21, 1998, in the United Kingdom and September 29, 1998, in the United States, then re-released in 1999. It was nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album and Best Engineered Non-Classical Album at the 1999 Grammys, winning the latter two awards. &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; reached  2 on the UK Albums Chart, while peaking at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, achieving US sales of two million as of January 2008. The album was recorded at and named for the sessions recorded at Globe Recording Studio in New York owned by Robert FitzSimons and Tracey Loggia.

In 2019 it was announced that the 2008 fire that swept through Universal Studios Hollywood ultimately destroyed buildings belonging to Universal Music Group. It was initially reported that &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; was one of hundreds of albums to have had their studio masters completely destroyed. However, in a 2022 interview with &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot;, this was revealed to be false, with Crow stating that &quot;luckily, they found most of mine in a different area.&quot;

==Track listing==


On earlier versions of the album the track &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; contains the hidden track &quot;Subway Ride&quot;, starting at 7:15 and running to 11:19, while omitting &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;. Another version eliminates both &quot;Subway Ride&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;. The version of &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; included is the &#x27;Rick Rubin New Mix&#x27;, originally featured on the &quot;Big Daddy&quot; soundtrack and later included on &quot;Hits &amp; Rarities&quot;, and also called the &#x27;Pop Version&#x27; on the CD single. It differs from the &#x27;Rock Version&#x27; used in the single music video. The European version features &quot;Resuscitation&quot; (Crow, Trott) as the twelfth track; the Japanese version contains the bonus tracks &quot;Carolina&quot; and &quot;Resuscitation&quot; (Crow, Trott). The Australian tour edition of the album (released in 1999) contains &quot;Resuscitation&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, and a bonus CD containing six songs recorded live at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto, Canada on November 13, 1998:

<text>Paolo Quagliati (c. 1555 – 16 November 1628) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque era and a member of the Roman School of composers. He was a transitional figure between the late Renaissance style and the earliest Baroque and was one of the first to write solo madrigals in the conservative musical center of Rome.

==Life==
Quagliati was born in Chioggia to an aristocratic family. Most of his life he spent in the service of various royal and aristocratic families. In 1594 he became a Roman citizen, and between 1605 and 1608 Quagliati was employed by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. Most likely he was organist at Santa Maria Maggiore from around 1608 until his death. During that time he also served as organist for various formal occasions around the city, and eventually he became private chamberlain to Pope Gregory XV. Towards the end of his life he was much respected, if not renowned, by his fellow composers, as can be judged from dedications of collections of music to him; however, some of this may have been due less to the quality of his music than to his direct papal connections and immense influence.

==Works and style==
Stylistically, Quagliati&#x27;s music is clear, elegant, and he generally uses simple diatonic harmonies. Some of his books of madrigals are in two versions: one for singing by equal voice parts, in the old Renaissance style, and another in what he calls the &quot;empty&quot; style, for single voice with instrumental accompaniment. These were examples of the new Baroque style of monody, and he states as much in the preface to his 1608 publication: &quot;I have decided to cater to both tastes.&quot; Quagliati was probably the first to publish solo madrigals in Rome, though monody in the form of solo madrigals had already existed for more than twenty years in northern Italy.

He wrote both sacred and secular vocal music, as well as some instrumental music. In his instrumental music, he makes little or no distinction between the style assigned to pieces with certain labels, such as ricercars or canzonas; this was an occasional practice at the time, and quite an annoying one to musicologists attempting to categorize music during this transitional period. Conventionally, a &quot;canzona&quot; around 1600 was a sectional instrumental piece, while a &quot;ricercar&quot; was a rather severe contrapuntal study, one of the ancestors of the fugue; the work of a few composers such as Quagliati make it necessary to qualify these terms as being of imprecise usage.

In 1606 he composed &quot;Il carro di fedeltà d&#x27;amore&quot;, which is considered the first secular &#x27;azione scenica&#x27; in Rome.

Of his surviving larger-scale works, one of the most interesting is &quot;La sfera armoniosa&quot;, which includes no less than 25 separate sections, including vocal solos and duets, all with an accompanying violin part. Much of it is written in the concertato style imported from northern Italy, though it would have seemed tame to a Venetian composer. He wrote this large work for the wedding of the nephew of the pope to Isabella Gesualdo, daughter of the famously murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo.
