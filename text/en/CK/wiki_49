<doc id="1132439" wikidata="Q7307173" url="?curid=1132439" title="Referendums related to the European Union">
<text>This is a list of referendums related to the European Union, or referendums related to the European Communities, which were predecessors of the European Union. Since 1972, a total of 48 referendums have been held by EU member states, candidate states, and their territories, with several additional referendums held in countries outside the EU. The referendums have been held most commonly on the subject of whether to become a member of European Union as part of the accession process, although the EU does not require any candidate country to hold a referendum to approve membership or as part of treaty ratification. Other EU-related referendums have been held on the adoption of the euro and on participation in other EU-related policies.

The United Kingdom is the only country as an EU member state to have held referendums on continued membership of the European Union and its antecedent organisation, the European Communities. In the first referendum in 1975, continued membership of what was then the European Communities (which included the European Economic Community, often referred to as the &quot;Common Market&quot; in the UK) was approved by 67.2% of voters, while in its second referendum in 2016 voters voted by 51.9% to leave the European Union, effectively reversing the result of the first referendum.

Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, voted to leave the EC in a referendum in 1982 by 53% of voters.

==Summary of referendums on membership==
== EC enlargement of 1973 ==

In 1972, four countries held referendums on the subject of the 1973 enlargement of the European Communities.

Following the French approval, three of the four candidate states (Ireland, Denmark and Norway) likewise held referendums on the issue of joining the European Communities. The United Kingdom did not hold a referendum before joining.
* — a referendum to approve the Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, 10 May 1972, 83.1% in favour, turnout 70.9%

: The Conservative government of Edward Heath did not hold a referendum before the United Kingdom joined the European Communities in 1973. The Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto for the 1974 general election included a pledge for an in-out referendum after a renegotiation of its membership. Accordingly, after Labour won under Harold Wilson, the referendum was held on whether to remain in the Communities after a renegotiation of its membership. The result was in favour of remaining.

== Greenland&#x27;s European Communities membership, 1982 ==

* — 1982 Greenlandic European Communities membership referendum, 23 February 1982, 53.0% against

However, after the establishment of home-rule and eurosceptic Siumut winning the 1979 Greenlandic parliamentary election, a referendum on membership was agreed upon, in which the voters rejected remaining part of the communities. This resulted in Greenland negotiating the terms of its separation from the EU, resulting in the Greenland Treaty, and Greenland&#x27;s leaving the communities in 1985.

== Future referendums ==
=== Joining the EU ===
Countries which seek to join the European Union in the future may hold a referendum as part of the accession process.

Iceland, which submitted an application for EU membership in 2009 but subsequently suspended negotiations after a change in government, has debated holding a referendum on resuming negotiations.

In Armenia, a hearing in the National Assembly on 21 June 2024 was organized by the United Platform of Democratic Forces (UPDF), to consider holding a referendum on the submission of an application for EU membership. On 27 June 2024, the president of the National Assembly, Alen Simonyan, confirmed that Armenia&#x27;s leadership wants the country to join the EU and that it will hold a referendum in the near future. Simonyan stated &quot;Our society has made a decision to be part of the European Union&quot; and &quot;I think that sometime in the near future we will have this referendum and I am sure that our people will say yes&quot;. On 25 October 2024, the UPDF announced that over 60,000 signatures had been collected in a nation-wide petition called &quot;Eurovote&quot;, in which signatures were gathered in support of holding a referendum on Armenia&#x27;s EU membership.

The constitution of France (Article 88-5) requires that any future treaty on the accession of new EU member states be approved in a referendum. Politicians in other existing member states have proposed referendums in their states, particularly with respect to the accession of Turkey.

=== Withdrawal from the EU ===
Similarly, there have been proposals by eurosceptic parties and movements across the EU on holding referendums on withdrawing from the EU, since the United Kingdom voted in favour of withdrawing in a 2016 referendum.

<text>Vitral was a magazine founded in Pinar del Río Province of Cuba.

==Origins of the name==
Old Cuban constructions inherited from the Spaniards have multicolored or polychrome glass on their windows. In Spanish these are called in &quot;Vitral&quot;. They resemble the stained glass windows of a church but on a smaller scale. The magazine&#x27;s name was intended to symbolize the need for transparency and a plurality of ideas in Cuba. The &quot;Vitral&quot; was intended to act as a window for Cuba and the people of Cuba to see the outside world. 

==History and profile==
&quot;Vitral&quot; was established the Diocese of Pinar del Río in western Cuba in 1994.
Dagoberto Valdés Hernández is the founder and Director of the Civic and Religious Education Center (CFCR) since 1993 and was the editor of its magazine, &quot;Vitral&quot; from 1994 to 2007 when the center and the magazine were seized.

In 1998, Vitral won the Principal Prince Claus Award, along with Fellag and Al Jazeera.

On April 12, 2007, the magazine announced it would close due to lack of funds.

As defined on its website, &quot;VITRAL was a Cuban socio-cultural Catholic magazine. A space for transparency and reflection in the pluralism and multicolor light the Civic and Religious Education Center offers, in the Pinar del Río Diocese&quot;. This magazine publishes articles about Cuba by Cubans independent from the government. Some of the articles published are critical of the Cuban government.

<doc id="1132445" wikidata="Q930723" url="?curid=1132445" title="Trilogy (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album)">
<text>Trilogy is the third studio album by English progressive rock supergroup Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released in June 1972, by Island Records. The group had spent most of 1971 touring, and paused in September so they could record a new album at Advision Studios with Eddy Offord resuming his role as engineer. It would be his last with the group, as he later elected to work full-time with Yes. The album features &quot;Hoedown&quot;, an arrangement of Aaron Copland&#x27;s ballet composition which became a live favourite.

The album was a commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Lake&#x27;s acoustic song, &quot;From the Beginning&quot;, was released as a single in August 1972 and became the band&#x27;s highest charting US single, reaching No. 39. Lake later picked &quot;Trilogy&quot; as his favourite Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album.

==Recording==
In September 1971, the band took a break in their tour promoting &quot;Tarkus&quot; (1971) and &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; (1971) to start work on a new studio album. They returned to Advision Studios in London, once again with Lake as producer and Eddy Offord as their engineer. In early 1972, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; falsely reported that the group were splitting up, causing the band to issue a statement. Keyboardist Keith Emerson had planned to do a solo album of jazz music, but the project was shelved and the band turned down a lucrative offer to write the score to a racing film entitled &quot;Fangio&quot;. The band recorded the album in October–November 1971 and January 1972.

The album was particularly difficult for Lake to record, as he described the album as &quot;such an accurate record&quot;. Palmer noted &quot;Trilogy&quot; had the most number of overdubs put down on an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album, owing to the &quot;enormous detail&quot; put into the arrangements of the songs. Emerson was pleased with the album after it was completed, noting its varied arrangements and difference in style compared to &quot;Tarkus&quot;. Greg Lake also later identified it as his favorite ELP album. However, the extensive use of overdubs on 24-track machines meant that many pieces including &quot;The Endless Engima&quot;, &quot;Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Abaddon&#x27;s Bolero&quot; proved difficult to play live and were consequently dropped from live performance early in the accompanying tour. As a result, the band vowed that their next album would be one they could reproduce entirely on stage.

References to a quad version of this album appeared in 1974 Harrison or Schwann record and tape guides, listing &quot;Trilogy&quot; in the Quadraphonic 8-track tape cartridge format. Collectors report never seeing a &quot;Trilogy&quot; Q8 at retail, despite its having a catalogue number &quot;Cotillion QT-9903&quot;.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;The Endless Enigma&quot; is a suite in three parts; the first section begins with the sound of a beating heart, an effect sometimes claimed to have been created by the Ludwig Speed King bass drum pedal of Palmer&#x27;s Ludwig Octaplus kit. However, in the sleeve notes to the 2015 CD/DVD reissue, remix engineer Jakko Jakszyk is quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;ve discovered [it is] actually Greg playing... muted strings on his bass guitar&quot;. Emerson can also be heard playing a zurna, a Eurasian wind instrument. The second part, &quot;Fugue&quot;, is a classical fugue with Emerson on piano and Lake playing counterpoint on bass. The third section returns to the &quot;Endless Enigma&quot; theme, ending on a series of horn-like synth fanfares.

&quot;From the Beginning&quot; is a soft, acoustic guitar-based ballad that peaked at on the US charts. More often appearing in ELP compilations than live concerts, the track lent its name to a 1997 retrospective of Greg Lake&#x27;s work. An alternate version of the song featuring a different take of the closing Moog solo is found on the 2015 deluxe reissue.

&quot;The Sheriff&quot; was written as a prelude to the country-themed &quot;Hoedown&quot;, which closes the side. During the opening drum solo, Palmer accidentally hit the rim of his tom-tom with a drumstick, and he can be heard responding with &quot;Shit!&quot;. The song ends with a honky tonk-type piano solo with Palmer playing woodblocks.

&quot;Hoedown&quot; is an arrangement of &quot;Hoe-Down&quot; from the ballet &quot;Rodeo&quot; (1942) by American composer Aaron Copland, who gave the band permission to adapt the piece. It became a live favorite and opened the band&#x27;s shows between 1972 and 1974.

===Side two===

The title track is divided, as per its name, into three distinct sections. The first section is a romantic piano ballad a la &quot;Take A Pebble&quot;, with lyrics about a broken relationship. The full band abruptly enters with bass, drums, and layers of Moog synthesizers for the second part, which is played in a robust 5/8 and features extensive soloing from Emerson. For the final section Lake&#x27;s vocal returns as the full band continues to play, now in 6/8, before ending on a showbiz coda. &quot;Trilogy&quot; was attempted on the spring 1972 tour but proved difficult to recreate without the extensive studio overdubs and was dropped from the set list after only two shows. Despite this, the track remains popular with ELP fans and is included on almost all compilations.

&quot;Living Sin&quot; is a hard rock number about an aggressive groupie that was never played live by the group, although a version with Marc Bonilla on guitar was attempted by the Keith Emerson Band. The remix of &quot;Living Sin&quot; on the 2015 reissue features an additional section of Emerson&#x27;s solo.

&quot;Abaddon&#x27;s Bolero&quot; sounds like a bolero turned into a march (in 4/4 rhythm rather than the usual 3/4). The piece was originally titled Bellona&#x27;s Bolero after the goddess of war. A single melody containing multiple modulations within itself is repeated over and over in ever more thickly layered arrangements, starting from a quiet Hammond organ making a flute-like sound over a snare drum, and building up to a wall of sound – Maurice Ravel&#x27;s famous &quot;Boléro&quot; uses a similar effect. There is also a quote from the British traditional song &quot;The Girl I Left Behind&quot;. &quot;Abaddon&#x27;s Bolero&quot; is replete with overdubs. Almost every time an instrument comes in, another overdub follows. Like the title track, &quot;Abaddon&#x27;s Bolero&quot; was only played live a handful of times, with Greg Lake handling Mellotron, bass pedals, and additional Moog synthesizer duties (other synth parts accompanied them from a reel-to-reel tape playing off-stage which Emerson had pre-recorded); the song turned out to be a disaster, and led to a heated backstage argument when the tape stopped mid-way through the song during one show, after which, it was cut from the set list. The band brought the piece back for the start of their 1977 tour, during which they were accompanied by an orchestra.

==Cover==

The artwork was designed by Hipgnosis. It depicts a combined bust of the three members, while the interior of the original gatefold sleeve features a photomontage of the three in Epping Forest. Spanish artist Salvador Dalí was approached to design it, but he requested $50,000 to do it and was subsequently turned down. The front cover depicts each of the band members&#x27; faces; Emerson said this was because their previous albums had not featured them.

==Reception==

The album reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200—their highest charting studio release in the US—and peaked at on the UK Albums chart. It appeared in the Top 10 in Denmark for 4 non-consecutive weeks, peaking at .

Robert Christgau said in his review that &quot;anybody who buys a record that divides a ... composition called &#x27;The Endless Enigma&#x27; into two discrete parts deserves it.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album for Keith Emerson&#x27;s &quot;steady progression&quot; on the Moog synthesizer, while &quot;Cashbox&quot; called the group &quot;rockdom&#x27;s most explosive trio&quot;, found &quot;From The Beginning&quot; especially favorable and predicted the album would &quot;find its way onto the top ten in nothing flat&quot;. Tony Palmer of &quot;The Observer&quot; thought the group &quot;demonstrates an extraordinary degree of bombast with little or no creative imagination at work to justify all the sound and fury&quot;. 

Retrospectively &quot;AllMusic&quot; commented that engineer Eddie Offord &quot;provided a lush, comfy finish to the album that made it particularly suited for living room listening and the FM airwaves.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; wrote that the album found the group at the height of their powers, which cemented them as &quot;one of the most experimental and ambitious groups in rock&quot;. When reviewing the 2015 deluxe reissue for &quot;Louder&quot;, Philip Wilding noted that 40 years on, the album&#x27;s &quot;bravura, pomposity and daring experimentation remain intact&quot;. Conversely, &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; gave the album a mixed B- grade with the summation &quot;There are a handful of moments to make it interesting, and the band&#x27;s professionalism and chemistry makes it listenable, but it rarely reaches the brilliance of the debut or the overblown grandeur of &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;.

==Reissues==
The album has been reissued a number of times, the most recent as part of a deluxe edition release campaign by Sony Record Group on the 27 April 2015. The original mix was included along with a brand new stereo mix across two CDs and featuring both on an audio DVD.

<text>Zera Yacob Amha Selassie (; Geʽez: ዘርዐ ያዕቆብ አምሃ ሥላሴ; born 17 August 1953) is the grandson of Emperor Haile Selassie and son of Amha Selassie of the Ethiopian Empire. He has been head of the Imperial House of Ethiopia since 17 February 1997 as recognized by the Crown Council of Ethiopia.

He was designated as &quot;acting crown prince&quot; and heir presumptive in 1974 by the Emperor Haile Selassie I close to the end of his reign; however, the Empire was overthrown in the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution by the Derg. As a result, Yacob never became a ruling Emperor of Ethiopia. Ethiopia became a Federal Democratic Republic in 1991.

==Biography==
Zera Yacob attended Eton College and graduated from Exeter College, Oxford and Sandhurst. He was named Acting Crown Prince and heir presumptive to the Imperial throne of Ethiopia in 1974 by his grandfather, Emperor Haile Selassie, following his father&#x27;s stroke a year earlier.

After the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy, Zera Yacob completed his studies at Oxford in the 1970s and worked briefly as a banker in the United States. He then moved to London and was married to Princess Nunu (née Getaneh), and later divorced. They had one daughter. He was named heir apparent by his father, who assumed the title of Emperor-in-exile at that time in April 1989 in London.

In 1992 he accompanied his father Amha Selassie to Virginia, United States, where his father had a medical check-up. However, his father suffered a stroke and Zera Yacob stayed for two years. He then applied for a visa following his father&#x27;s death in 1997. He had returned to London, England, where he had settled in a modest home on the Isle of Dogs.

Yacob has been the Executive Director of the Ethiopian Peace Foundation (EPF) since 2002.

==Honours==
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Lazarus (Orléans-French Royal Family)
* Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Imperial Order of St. Andrew (Russian Imperial Family)
* Knight Grand Collar of the Order of the Eagle of Georgia (Georgian Royal Family)

<text>FK Rad () is a football club based in Banjica, Belgrade, Serbia. They compete in the Belgrade Zone League, the fourth tier of the national league system.

Founded in 1958, the club spent a total of 30 seasons in the top flight between 1987 and 2021, including five seasons in the Yugoslav First League, 12 seasons in the First League of Serbia and Montenegro, and 13 seasons in the Serbian SuperLiga.

==History==
The club was founded on 10 March 1958 by GP Rad, a local construction company. They acquired the league rights from FK Razvitak, a small club based in Banjica, going on to compete in the local leagues of Belgrade until the early 1970s. The club earned promotion to the Yugoslav Second League in 1973, spending the next 14 seasons in the second tier of Yugoslav football. They also reached the 1981–82 Yugoslav Cup quarter-finals, losing to Dinamo Zagreb.

In the 1986–87 Yugoslav Second League, the club became champions in Group East and took promotion to the Yugoslav First League for the first time in history. They placed 15th in their debut appearance in the top flight, just one point above the relegation zone. The club subsequently finished in fourth place in the 1988–89 season, earning a spot in the 1989–90 UEFA Cup. They were eliminated in the first round after losing 3–2 on aggregate to Olympiacos.

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the club continued to compete in the top flight, placing fifth in the 1992–93 First League of FR Yugoslavia. They would also place in the top five in three consecutive seasons from 1998 to 2000. With the beginning of the new millennium, the club slowly started to decline and eventually suffered relegation in the 2002–03 season. They returned to the top flight of Serbia and Montenegro football in its final edition, but were promptly relegated.

Having spent two seasons in the Serbian First League, the club placed fourth in 2007–08 and managed to earn promotion to the Serbian SuperLiga via the play-offs. They finished fourth in 2010–11, which meant qualification for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League and a return to European football after 22 years. After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the top flight, the club suffered relegation in 2021. They would eventually finish bottom of the table in the 2022–23 Serbian First League, dropping to the third tier for the first time in 50 years.

After suffering a second consecutive relegation in 2024, the club found itself in the Belgrade Zone League, the fourth tier of Serbian football.

<text>Honor Oak Park is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services operated by Southern, located in the suburban area of Honor Oak in the London Borough of Lewisham. It is down the line from , between and . It is located in Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==
The line on which it stands was opened in 1839, but this station was only opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on 1 April 1886. The housebuilders who were developing the area contributed £1,000 towards the cost of construction. There are four tracks through the station, with platforms on the outer Slow lines. These platforms are connected to the booking office (see illustration) by a footbridge. It was named to distinguish it from the Honor Oak station which existed at the time.

London Overground took over operating the station in September 2009, which has benefited from the London Overground East London line extension, completed in May 2010. The East London line scheme has led to Honor Oak Park being well connected to other stations in South and East London with direct trains to Whitechapel (19 minutes), Shoreditch (23 minutes), Canada Water (10 minutes), London Victoria and London Bridge (11 minutes). Commuter areas such as Canary Wharf, Liverpool Street, Kings Cross and Waterloo are just one change of train away. From 2021 you will be able to directly interchange with Crossrail service at Whitechapel.

Despite past hopes that the Thameslink Project could provide direct trains along the Thameslink core via St Pancras International to destinations north of London, since the completion of the project in 2020, Thameslink trains have continued to run fast through the station, though with an improved interchange at London Bridge.

==Services==
Honor Oak Park is on the Windrush line of the London Overground, with services operated using EMUs. Additional services are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to 
* 8 tph to via (Windrush line)
* 2 tph to via 
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)
* 4 tph to (Windrush line)

The station is also served by a single early morning and late evening service to via , with the early morning service continuing to and .

==Connections==
London Buses routes P4 and P12 serve the station.

<doc id="1132518" wikidata="Q3118398" url="?curid=1132518" title="Sitdown strike">
<text>A sit-down strike (or simply sitdown) is a labour strike and a form of civil disobedience in which an organized group of workers, usually employed at factories or other centralized locations, take unauthorized or illegal possession of the workplace by &quot;sitting down&quot; at their stations. By taking control of their workplaces, workers engaged in a sit-down demonstrate their power, build solidarity among themselves, prevent the deployment of strikebreakers or removal of industrial equipment, and cause cascading effects on the chain of production within and between factories. However, sit-down strikes are illegal in the vast majority of countries, complicating their use.

Sitdown strikes played a central role in the unionization of manufacturing in the United States and France. In major strikes in the rubber and automotive industries in the United States, labor organizers with the United Rubber Workers of America and United Automobile Workers adopted the sitdown strike as a means for demanding unionization of factories, achieving major successes at Goodyear Tire (1936), General Motors (1936–37), and Chrysler (1937). Sit-down strikes peaked in the United States in 1937, and rapidly declined as workers began to face criminal prosecution for occupations while the National Labor Relations Board supervised both unionization elections and collective bargaining by between recognized unions and employers. While some sit-down strikes still occur in the United States, they tend to be spontaneous and short-lived.

A wave of sit-down strikes in France in May to August 1936 demanded and won union recognition and industry-wide negotiations on wages and benefits, and coincided with state guarantees of limited hours, vacation pay, and other social reforms.

== Form and purpose ==
Writers in the 1930s, 1960s, and early 2000s have all described the same basic forms of sitdown or sit-in strikes. Author Louis Adamic, in his account of the late 1930s wave of sit-down strikes in the United States wrote the following definition in the fall of 1936:

SITDOWN, n. Act of quitting work in one or a few departments of a delicately organized mass-production factory with the aim of stopping operations in the entire or most of the plant; specif. such an act done by mutual agreement by workers in one or a few departments of such a factory as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made upon their employers; sudden strike workers in one or a few departments of such a factor, decided upon and called by themselves while on the job, usually without the sanction of any recognized labor-union leader or official and, as a rule, of short duration, the strikers and the rest of the workers remaining idle (sitting down) by their machines or belt conveyors pending the compliance with their (the strikers&#x27;) demands. See STAY-IN and QUICKY.

Ahmed White distinguishes three types of sit-in strikes: &quot;short, &#x27;quickie&#x27; strikes, characterized by brief, on-the-job work stoppages,&quot; like those described by Adamic; &quot;the classic &#x27;stay-in&#x27; strike&quot;, defined &quot;a work stoppage in which the strikers occupied the workplace to prevent the employer from using it for a considerable period of time&quot;; and &quot;&#x27;skippy&#x27; strikes, characterized by intentionally sloppy performance on the production line.&quot; Sit-down strikes also built upon the tactics, used by the Industrial Workers of the World, of the &quot;folded arms strike&quot; and &quot;striking on the job&quot; (which, according to Adamic, &quot;required men to pretend they were working, and to accomplish as little as possible without being discharged&quot;).

In factories built around assembly lines, sit-down strikes enabled small numbers of workers to interrupt production across an entire plant. In industries with complex chains of production, such as automobile manufacturing, it likewise projected power outward from a factory on strike: &quot;just as a militant minority could stop production in an entire plant, so if the plant was a key link in an integrated corporate empire, its occupation could paralyze the corporation.&quot; Adamic describes the sit-down strike as educating workers about their power as well as providing an opportunity to organize non-union workers:
&quot;And sitting by their machines, caldrons, boilers, and work benches, they talked. Some realized for the first time how important they were in the process of rubber production. Twelve men had practically stopped the works! … The active [i.e., pro-union] rank-and-filers, scattered through the various sections of the plant, took the initiative in saying, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got to stick with &#x27;em!&#x27; And they stuck with them, union and non-union men alike.&quot; White describes this process as &quot;an extraordinary forum for cultivating loyalty and solidarity among workers, offering rank-and-file workers a salient symbol of the union&#x27;s ability to confront the employer, as well as numerous occasions for the actual practice of mutual support.&quot;

When feasible, sit-down strikes offered numerous strategic and tactical advantages. Adamic observed in the 1930s that &quot;[Quickie] sitdowns are quick, short, and free of violence.&quot; The tactic prevents employers from replacing them with strikebreakers or removing equipment to transfer production to other locations. Neal Ascherson has commented that an additional attraction is that it emphasizes the role of workers in providing for the people and allows workers to in effect hold valuable machinery hostage as a bargaining chip. Other advantages listed by Adamic include:

* Sitdown strikes happen inside factories, where workers have the advantage of familiarity and knowledge of the space. This contrasts with the tactical advantages that police and private security have in outdoor picket lines.
* While many workers are morally opposed to sabotage, &quot;The sitdown is the opposite of sabotage… It destroys nothing.&quot;
* By stopping work but keeping workers in a single space, the sitdown strike generates a new and enjoyable social space for hundreds or thousands of workers: &quot;The sitdown is a social affair. Sitting workers talk. They get acquainted. And they like that.&quot;

Labor strategists who recognized the value of the sit-down strike include Dutch Council Communist Anton Pannekoek, American labor historian Jeremy Brecher, and sociologist Beverly Silver.

== History ==
In describing the origins of the sitdown strike, scholars, workers, and politicians have pointed to construction strikes at the pyramids of ancient Egypt and medieval European cathedrals. Strikes by crews aboard merchant ships, which peaked in the eighteenth century &quot;were (and remain) like sit-down strikes by their very nature&quot; and spread to the rest of the maritime industry. Early twentieth-century stoppages were recorded in the French, Argentine, and United States rail industry.

In September 1920, the Federation of Italian Metal Workers led a wave of strikes over wages, eventually involving nearly five hundred thousand workers, and featuring numerous factory occupations. During the struggle, workers began operating some factories under their own control and Communist factory workers demanded control of the industry itself by workers&#x27; councils. Workers staged strikes that occupied mines in Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, Spain, France, England, and Wales from 1934 to 1936. These included a successful strike in Carniola in July 1934. A major sitdown strike occurred on March 22, 1936 at Krakow&#x27;s Semperit rubber works, during which violence claimed the lives of six people.

Labor historian Michael Torigian argues that the use of sit-down strikes and factory occupations by labor organizers in the United States and France in the 1930s marked an important shift in the role of the sitdown strike. In the United States and France, the sitdown strikes became &quot;an aspect of the evolving labor movement as it pursued union goals within the context of the Fordist-Taylorist factory system&quot;, specifically the creation of industry-wide unions like the United Auto Workers. As a tool for industry and even nationwide unionization, Torigian concludes, sit-down strikes &quot;took on a significance, a character, and an effect quite unlike anything that had previously occurred.&quot;

=== United States ===

A few sit-down strikes happened in the United States before 1933. Pittsburgh steelworkers occupied a mill in 1842. In 1884, brewery workers in Cincinnati barricaded themselves for three days. New York City laundry workers sat down in 1896 in support of a garment workers’ strike. The Industrial Workers of the World were involved in the most prominent early sit-down in the United States—at the General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York, in 1906. This strike, which lasted 65 hours, was the first over-night &quot;stay-in&quot; in the United States. Adamic describes the 1922 Amoskeag textile strike in Manchester, New Hampshire as &quot;something very close to a stay-in.&quot;

During the 1930s, the sit-down strike was reinvented and used by American workers at a scale never seen before or since. Ahmed White attributes its popularity to rising labor militancy combined with new official acceptance of labor rights through the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA, 1933; invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1935) and the National Labor Relations Act (1935). Around six hundred meatpacking workers sat down for three days at the Hormel Packing Corporation in Austin, Minnesota, in November 1933. Minnesota&#x27;s governor called up the National Guard, but also pressed Hormel to negotiate with the workers rather than retaliate for their actions. A significant number of sit-down strikes were organized in the rubber and automotive industry from 1933 to 1935, most of them &quot;of the quickie variety,&quot; according to Sidney Fine.

In Akron, Ohio, rubber workers innovated sitdown strike tactics during the 1930s. Louis Adamic, reporting on the phenomenon had originated outside the factory in a baseball game played between two teams of rubber workers in 1933. During the game, players discovered that a disliked umpire was not a union man and sat down on the field and interrupted their game. Their factory-worker audience joined the protest and &quot;yelled for an umpire who was a union member, cheered the NIRA, and generally raised a merry din, till the non-union umpire withdrew and a union man called the game.&quot; Within weeks a factory dispute touched off a sitdown action in one department, which soon idled other departments and shut down the plant, and the dispute was resolved in their favor in less than an hour. Similar strikes proliferated in Akron rubber factories over the following years, sometimes extending into multiple day &quot;stay-in&quot; strikes.

In June–July 1934, 1,100 workers at General Tire conducted a two-day sit-down strike followed by a month-long conventional strike and picket, resulting in victory for the union&#x27;s demands. While General Tire did not formally recognize the union, it raised wages, promised to disband the company union, rehired fired strikers, instituted a seniority pay system, and agreed to meet union representatives on request. In early 1936, a series of smaller, brief sit-down strikes from at Firestone, Goodyear, and Goodrich from January 28 through February 14 presaged a larger conflict. Management responded to sit-downs at Columbia Chemical Company (February 17–18 in Barberton) and at Goodyear (February 17–22) by physically isolating striking workers to a part of the plant, resulting in stay-in strikes supported by outsiders bringing food. The latter strike evolved into the Great Goodyear Strike of 1936, which was resolved on terms favoring the workers and the United Rubber Workers union on March 21. It was a major victory for the labor movement, established the United Rubber Workers as the dominant union in the rubber industry, and provided a new tactic for future labor struggles.

Buoyed by sit-in strikes at the Atlanta and Kansas City Fisher Body plants (November and December 1936), the United Auto Workers began to demand to represent General Motors workers nationwide, part of the Congress of Industrial Organizations&#x27; (CIO) vision for industrial unionism. An initial strike in Cleveland on December 28 was followed by the famous Flint sit-down strike on December 30. In Flint, Michigan, strikers occupied several General Motors plants for more than forty days, and repelled the efforts of the police and National Guard to retake them. that led GM to recognize the autoworkers union. By January 25, strikes and the effects of production shutdowns idled 150,000 workers at fifty General Motors plants from California to New York. On February 11, 1937, General Motors agreed to bargain with the UAW, marking a turning point in American unionism.

A wave of sit-down strikes followed but diminished by the end of the decade as the courts and the National Labor Relations Board held that sit-down strikes were illegal and sit-down strikers could be fired. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 583 sit-down strikes from 1936 to 1939, involving the workplaces of 518,099 workers.

==== Legality ====
The legality of the sit-down strike was in flux during the mid-1930s, the period when the tactic was most used. Labor strikes themselves had sometimes been illegal during the four decades prior to the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). In the 1936–37 Flint strike, the UAW argued that the sit-down strike, like the conventional picket line, prevented employers from hiring strike-breakers and that the striking worker was &quot;protecting his private property–his right to a job.&quot; Other advocates expected the practice to soon be legalized, just as striking had been by the NLRA. The UAW also justified the sit-down strike as a reasonable response to the employer&#x27;s failure to bargain collectively and refrain from unfair labor practices as directed by the NLRA. General Motors, joined in this opinion by the American Civil Liberties Union, held that the sit-down strike constituted an illegal trespass. Michigan Governor Frank Murphy, whose restraint of law enforcement affected the Flint strike, felt that the sit-down strike was illegal, but could be legitimized in the future. Historian Sidney Fine wrote, &quot;Since the sit-downers were pursuing objectives sanctioned by law but denied them by their employer, their unconventional behavior was tolerated by large sections of the public.&quot;

Employers and sought and received court injunctions against the Akron rubber strike and the GM strike, but these and many other sit-down strikes were resolved by union–employer agreements, many of which reinstated any workers fired for participating in sit-downs. The National Labor Relations Board also ordered employers to reinstate workers fired for sit-down striking until this power was removed by the Supreme Court. The 1939 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.&quot; affirmed that sit-down strikes were illegal and held that strikers had no recourse if they were fired in retaliation. In the 1941 case &quot;Southern Steamship Co. v. NLRB&quot;, the Supreme Court held that sailors who went on strike aboard ship were guilty of mutiny and could not claim protection of labor law. Ahmed White argues that these cases &quot;provided a legal foundation on which expanded attacks on the right to strike could be based.&quot;

After this period, the sit-down strike was &quot;relegated to the ranks of illegal and illegitimate protest&quot; in the United States, but became &quot;a weapon of the militant rank and file,&quot; when they were willing to act outside of official union channels &quot;(See: Little Steel strike)&quot;. Such wildcat strikes, such as two stoppages at Chrysler plants in Detroit in 1973, sometimes won on-the-job changes.

During a 1989 strike of Pittston Coal, ninety-eight members of the United Mine Workers (and one clergyman) occupied a mine for three days in a collective action they called &quot;Operation Flintstone&quot; to honor the 1936–37 UAW strike. Workers vacated the mine after three days and a court order. The strike was won months after the September occupation. 

In December 2008, workers at a Republic Windows and Doors warehouse in Chicago responded to their firing amid the company declaring bankruptcy by initiating a sit-down strike occupying the worksite. The workers demanded vacation and severance pay, and to be re-hired by a new owner of the site, winning both demands.

=== France ===
French metal and automotive workers conducted sit-down strikes beginning in 1931 amid the Great Depression. At least 31 strikes occurred in 1931, beginning at the Chenard-et-Walker auto body plant in March. Lengthier strikes affected auto producers Renault, Citroën, and Fiat from 1931 to 1935. In all of these strikes, workers did not remain in the workplaces overnight, though sitdowns often kicked off longer-duration strikes that continued outside the plants.

Coordinated strikes in France led to political changes and industry-wide bargaining agreements in 1936. First, a conventional general strike in February built an alliance among left political forces and trade unions, which led to Popular Front electoral victory in the elections of April and May 1936. Sitdown strikes won concessions from employers in mid-May in Le Havre, Toulouse, and Paris, proving the tactic&#x27;s effectiveness in French industry. Around 600,000 demonstrators took part in a May 24 march to the Mur des Fédérés commemorating the Paris Commune. On May 26, metal workers mobilized by the Paris Metal Union (affiliated with the CGT) began occupying six factories in this industry. Other factories soon joined, including the automaker Renault. After a brief negotiated end to the occupations, 150,000 metal workers occupied workplaces on June 2. After assuming office on June 4, Prime Minister Léon Blum oversaw negotiations with the CGT and industry, resulting in the June 7 Matignon Agreement: &quot;granting union recognition, a hefty wage hike, a system of shop stewards, as well as the principle of the forty-hour week and the two-week paid vacation.&quot; However, strikes and occupations continued to multiply, eventually drawing in 2 million workers. Collective bargaining with industry and new legislation passed by the Popular Front in May resulted in wage increases, a system of industry-wide collective bargaining, vacation pay, and other gains for workers. While the strike wave peaked in June, some workers remained on strike as late as August 1936.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1973, the workers at the Triumph Motorcycles factory at Meriden, West Midlands, England, locked the new owners, NVT, out following the announcement of their plan to close Meriden. The sit-in lasted over a year until the British government intervened, the result of which was the formation of the Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative which produced Triumphs until their closure in 1983.

=== Switzerland ===
In November 2010, workers at the International Labor Organization, an intergovernmental organization that oversees workers&#x27; rights, staged a sit-down strike at its headquarters to protest short-term work contracts for staffers.

== Legacy ==
The sit-down strike was the inspiration for the sit-in, where an organized group of protesters would occupy an area in which they are not wanted by sitting and refuse to leave until their demands are met. Sidney Fine cites the protest form as being echoed and replicated in both the lunch counter sit-ins of the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and in the university occupations of the 1960s.

<doc id="1132522" wikidata="Q1929855" url="?curid=1132522" title="Tramp trade">
<text>A boat or ship engaged in the tramp trade is one which does not have a fixed schedule, itinerary nor published ports of call, and trades on the spot market as opposed to freight liners. A steamship engaged in the tramp trade is sometimes called a tramp steamer; similar terms, such as tramp freighter and tramper, are also used. Chartering is done chiefly on London, New York, and Singapore shipbroking exchanges. The Baltic Exchange serves as a type of stock market index for the trade.

The term tramper is derived from the British meaning of &quot;tramp&quot;, as being an itinerant beggar or vagrant. In this context, it was first documented in the 1880s, along with &quot;ocean tramp&quot; (at the time many sailing vessels engaged in irregular trade as well).

==History==
The tramp trade first took off in Britain around the mid-19th century. The dependability and timeliness of steam ships was found to be more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships&#x27; boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coal to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years tramp ships became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities to the rest of the world. 
The size of tramp ships remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship, a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, and which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. 

After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of tramp ships exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During that time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. Bulk carriers were designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave them more flexibility and could service more ports than some of their predecessors, which only carried a single commodity.


Today, the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined, such as oil or bulk carriers, to accommodate many different markets, depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. Tramp ships often carry their own gear, such as booms, cranes and derricks, in case the ports they use lack suitable equipment for loading or discharging cargo.

==Tramp charters==

The tramp ship is a contract carrier. Unlike a liner, often called a common carrier, which has a fixed schedule and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand. To generate business, a contract to lease the vessel known as a &quot;charterparty&quot; is drawn up between the ship owner and the charterer. There are three types of charters: voyage, time, and demise.

=== Voyage charter ===
The voyage charter is the most common charter in tramp shipping. The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a seaworthy ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. This type of charter is the most lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a voyage charter a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of voyage charter – net form and gross form. 

Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer&#x27;s expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the voyage charter if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays &quot;demurrage&quot;, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called &quot;lay days&quot;.

=== Time charter ===
In a time charter, the owner provides a vessel that is fully crewed and equipped. The owner provides the crew, but the crew takes orders from the charterer. The owner is also responsible for insuring the vessel, repairs the vessel may need, engine parts and food for the ship&#x27;s personnel. The charterer is responsible for everything else. The main advantage of the time charter is that it diverts the costs of running a ship to the charterer.

=== Demise charter ===
The demise charter is the least used in the tramp trade. The ship owner only provides a ship devoid of any crew, stores, or fuel. It is the charterer&#x27;s responsibility to provide everything the ship will need. The ship owner must provide a seaworthy vessel, but once the charterer accepts the vessel, the responsibility of seaworthiness is the charterer&#x27;s. The charterer crews the vessel, but the owner can make recommendations. There are no standardized forms in a demise charter, contracts can vary greatly, and are written up to meet the needs of the charterer.

==Brokerage==
Tramp ship owners and tramp ship charterers rely on brokers to find cargoes for their ships to carry. A broker understands international trade conditions, the movements of goods, market prices and the availability of the owner&#x27;s ships.

The Baltic Exchange, in London, is the physical headquarters for tramp ship brokerage. The Baltic Exchange works like an organised market and provides a meeting place for ship owners, brokers and charterers. It also provides easy access to information on market fluctuations and commodity prices to all the parties involved. Brokers can use it to quickly match a cargo to a ship or ship to a cargo depending on whom they are working for. A committee of owners, brokers and charterers are elected to manage the exchange to ensure everyone&#x27;s interests are represented. With the speed of today&#x27;s communications the floor of the Baltic Exchange is not nearly as populated as it once was, but the information and networking the exchange provides is still an asset to the tramp trade.

==2000s==
Due to the explosion of liner services, and in large part, due to containerisation since the 1960s, the tramp trade has decreased, but is by no means ended. A contemporary trend in the shipping business has resulted in renewed interest in tramp shipping. To increase profits, liner companies are looking at investing into tramp ships to create a buffer when the market is down. For example, Mitsui OSK Lines possesses a large fleet with tramp ships and liners. With both types of shipping covered they are able to service a world economy even in a down market. 

The advantage of tramp ships is they are relied upon at a moment&#x27;s notice to service any type of market. Even in a down economy there will be a market for some type of commodity somewhere and the company with the ships able to exploit that market will do better than the company relying on liner services alone.

==In fiction==
Tramp steamers and freighters are associated with off-the-beaten track, romanticized adventure and intrigue in pulp stories, children&#x27;s books, novels, films, and other fictional works. When characters such as spies or resistance fighters are on the run, or lovers are fleeing from an affair gone wrong, tramp steamers are used to slip in or out of a country. The crew of a tramp steamer is often a picaresque mix of societal outcasts and rogues with colourful (or even illegal-activity-filled) pasts who cannot or who do not want to work elsewhere. 

Steamers are often depicted as operating in a grey area of legality, both in terms of their lax observance of steamship safety regulations and their plying of black market trades and smuggling of goods and passengers. Fiction writers depicted tramp steamers as a way that penniless adventurers can explore exotic ports by being taken on as a crew member.

===Examples===

* In the film &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; (1968), a dilapidated tramp steamer &quot;Corita&quot; is smuggling a dangerous explosive cargo. The Captain ignores a customs launch wanting to inspect his ship as he is smuggling white phosphorus. Some passengers are trying to escape their past indiscretions or eluding capture (one with stolen bearer bonds). 
* In the film &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), a British tramp steamer SS &quot;Glencairn&quot; goes from the West Indies to Baltimore and then finally to England. The crew is a motley, fun-loving, hard-drinking lot who are smuggling rum. The crew thinks one aloof crew member might be a German spy because he is so secretive and he has a locked box under his bed.
* In the film &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), a tramp steamer, the &quot;African Queen&quot;, is converted into a torpedo boat to sink a German gunboat. 
* In the 1937 musical comedy film &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, hoofer Terry Rooney (James Cagney) takes his bride, singer Rita Wyatt (Evelyn Daw) on a tramp steamer for their honeymoon. They are the only passengers. Rooney is turning his back on Hollywood, disgusted by his experience working on one picture. The film is a hit, but no one can find him. When the ship returns at last to San Francisco, he discovers that he is Hollywood&#x27;s newest star. There is a long scene aboard ship where the crew joins in a talent show.
* Much of the action in &quot;Across the Pacific&quot;, a 1942 spy film set in the three weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor, takes place aboard the &quot;Genoa Maru&quot;, a fictional Japanese cargo ship. The passengers include: former Captain Rick Leland (Humphrey Bogart), a disgraced United States Army Coast Artillery Corps, working as a secret U.S. agent; Canadian Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor) who claims to be from Medicine Hat; and Dr. Lorenz (Sydney Greenstreet) a great admirer of the Japanese. Characters spar over the dinner table and lurk in corridors.
* The Robert Heinlein novel &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; concerns a family who buy a used spacecraft and travel the solar system, financed partly by trading goods to asteroid miners. The novel was derived from a shorter story titled &quot;Tramp Space Ship&quot;. 
* In the Star Wars series, the oft-appearing Millennium Falcon is a tramp starship, as it is a freighter with no fixed route. 
*In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), Nazis intercept the Ark of the Covenant as it is being transported from Cairo to London aboard a tramp steamer &quot;Bantu Wind&quot;.
*In &quot;Lurulu&quot;, a 2004 sci-fi adventure, a crew of pilgrims and adventure seekers voyage to exotic planets on a tramp space freighter.

<text>Byram is an unincorporated community within Kingwood Township in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

In 1855 a bridge was built across the Delaware River north of Byram to connect with Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania. The Point Pleasant-Byram Bridge existed until 1955 when it was destroyed by the Great Flood of 1955 brought on by Hurricane Diane.

Byram also once had a railroad station along Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Belvidere Division which opened back in 1852 when the railroad reached Byram. The station was also destroyed in the Great Flood of 1955 and was never rebuilt. The railroad continued to be used for freight until 1978 when it was abandoned and subsequently demolished for a recreational trail in the early 1980s.

<text>John Bastwick (1593–1654) was an English Puritan, physician and controversial writer. He was punished for his sedition and this included having his ears removed. He was supported by petitions from his wife Susanna Bastwick.

==Early life==
Bastwick was born at Writtle, Essex. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 19 May 1614, but remained there only a very short time, and left the university without a degree. He travelled and served for a time as a soldier, probably in the Dutch army. He then studied medicine abroad, and took the degree of M.D. at Padua. Back in England in 1623, he settled at Colchester, where he practised as a physician.

==Career==

Bastwick was a Latin stylist, and began a career as a controversialist with Latin works. In 1634 he published in the Netherlands two anti-Catholic Latin treatises: &quot;Elenchus Religionis Papisticae&quot;, an answer to a Catholic called Richard Short; and &quot;Flagellum Pontificis&quot;, an argument in favour of Presbyterianism. The latter came to the notice of William Laud. He had Bastwick brought before the Court of High Commission, where he was convicted of a &quot;scandalous libel&quot;, was condemned to pay a fine of £1,000 and costs, and was imprisoned in the Gatehouse Prison adjoining Westminster Abbey until he should recant. In 1636 Bastwick published &quot;Πράξεις τῶν επισκόπων, sive Apologeticus ad Praesules Anglicanos&quot;, written in the Gatehouse against the high commission court.
In 1637 he produced in English the four parts of his &quot;Letanie of Dr. John Bastwicke&quot;, in which bishops were denounced as the enemies of God and the tail of The Beast. For this publication he was summoned before the Star Chamber. The request for a work in English came from the publisher John Wharton. The &quot;Letanie&quot; was printed by a Dutch press for John Lilburne, who had been brought to the Gatehouse in 1636 by the clothier Thomas Hewson and minister Edmund Rosier. Lilburne was just finishing an apprenticeship with Hewson, and smuggled the text abroad, but was betrayed by his assistant in importing the &quot;Letanie&quot;, John Chilliburne, who worked for Wharton. At the time Bastwick was comfortable enough in prison, living with his wife and family and complaining that he ate roast meat only once a week.

Similar proceedings were taken against William Prynne for his &quot;Histrio-Mastix&quot;, and Henry Burton for &quot;seditious&quot; sermons. Bastwick&#x27;s voluminous defence, which was also published, aggravated his case. He was found guilty, and along with the others sentenced to lose his ears in the pillory, to pay a fine of £5,000, and to be imprisoned for life. This sentence was carried out with a supportive audience. Bastwick supplied his own scalpel and his wife Susanna kissed his ears before they were removed. After the event she took each ear and placed them by her bosom.

Bastwick was afterwards moved to Star Castle, Isles of Scilly. In November 1640 he was released by order of the Long Parliament, and in December entered London in triumph. Reparation to the amount of the fines imposed was ordered to be made to him (2 March 1641). In 1642, as the First English Civil War broke out, Bastwick was a captain of the Leicester trained bands, and on 22 July he was taken prisoner by the royalists at Leicester, and sent as a prisoner to York.

Soon at liberty again, he published in 1643 a &quot;Declaration demonstrating ... that all malignants, whether they be prelates, &amp;c., are enemies to God and the church&quot;. The Parliamentary success in the war brought by 1645 a new relationship between the Presbyterians and other Protestant groups, classified as Independents, such as the emerging Quakers and Congregationalists. Bastwick with Prynne was a hard-liner on the Presbyterian side; Burton wanted a less harsh approach, and by then Lilburne was a very popular Independent, beginning to found the Levellers.

Bastwick with Colonel Edward King arranged for Lilburne to be arrested on 19 July 1645 for words he had said against the Speaker of the House of Commons; he was in custody until October. In 1648 Bastwick published two bitter tracts against the Independents, and in defence of himself against Lilburne.

==Death==
Bastwick died in 1654. Richard Smith, in his &quot;Obituary,&quot; gives 6 October 1654 as the date of his burial.

==Private life==
Bastwick married Susanna Poe and they had five children. Twin girls, Judith and Dionise, were born in 1626, two boys named John in 1633 and 1646 and lastly Susanna born in 1640.

<text>Sergei Zholtok (), also known as Sergejs Žoltoks (December 2, 1972 – November 3, 2004) was a Latvian professional ice hockey centre. He played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins, Ottawa Senators, Montreal Canadiens, Edmonton Oilers, Minnesota Wild and Nashville Predators from 1993 to 2004.

==Playing career==
Žoltoks was drafted 55th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to being drafted, he won a gold medal with USSR national team in IIHF Junior World Championships in 1992. After playing 25 games with the Boston Bruins in the 1992–93 NHL season and the 1993–94 NHL season, Žoltoks spent the next years playing in minor leagues.

Žoltoks returned to the NHL in the 1996–97 NHL season with the Ottawa Senators. In the following years, he played for the Montreal Canadiens, Edmonton Oilers, Minnesota Wild and the Nashville Predators.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Žoltoks returned to Latvia and played for Riga 2000 team of the Latvian Hockey Higher League and the Belarusian Extraleague. 

=== Death ===
On November 3, 2004, his cardiac arrhythmia resurfaced during the game between Riga 2000 and Dinamo Minsk. Žoltoks left the game with five minutes remaining, collapsing and dying after returning to the dressing room in the arms of teammate Darby Hendrickson. An autopsy determined heart failure as the cause of death. He was survived by his wife, Anna, and two sons. This was not the first occurrence; in January 2003, he had to leave the game due to arrhythmia, and had been observed in a hospital overnight. He was allowed to return to playing after missing seven games.

During his ten seasons in the NHL, he played in 588 regular season games, scored 111 goals and had 147 assists.

===Team changes===
* After failing to complete the 2002 season due to financial difficulties, the Arrows team had their application for admission to the 2003 championship rejected by the FIA prior to the season start date. No reason was publicly given by the FIA and Arrows subsequently folded after 25 years in Formula One since .
* Jordan switched to Ford engines for 2003, after their previous suppliers, Honda, opted to focus on their partnership with BAR. Jordan&#x27;s contract with the Japanese engine manufacturer was due to expire at the end of the 2003 season, but Honda were no longer willing to provide Jordan with free engines. A link-up with, and possible buy-out by, Asiatech was rumoured, although this did not prove to be the case, and, when funding was withdrawn from the company, Asiatech was wound down. Minardi, who had been using Asiatech engines in 2002, switched to Cosworth units for 2003.
===Driver changes===
* Fernando Alonso, the team&#x27;s test driver in 2002, was promoted to a full-time drive at Renault, replacing Jenson Button. Button moved to BAR, where he took the seat vacated by the Toyota-bound Olivier Panis. Panis joined Formula One debutant, and reigning CART champion, Cristiano da Matta at the Japanese team, in an all-new lineup for 2003. Allan McNish, one of the drivers replaced at Toyota, signed with Renault as a test driver, while his teammate from 2002, Mika Salo, left Formula One altogether.
* Felipe Massa left his Sauber drive to assume the duties of test driver for Ferrari. His place at Sauber was taken by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who had replaced Massa on a one-off basis for the United States Grand Prix (by which time Frentzen was already confirmed as a Sauber driver for 2003), after having driven for Arrows before the team&#x27;s collapse.
* Takuma Sato left the Jordan team to take the place of several others (Anthony Davidson, Darren Manning, Ryo Fukuda and Patrick Lemarié) as the sole test driver for BAR, being replaced by 2002 Formula Nippon champion Ralph Firman.
* Jaguar replaced both Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa for 2003. Their new drivers were Mark Webber, who signed from Minardi, and debutant Antônio Pizzonia, who drove in the International Formula 3000 series in 2002 whilst also performing test driver duties for Williams. Webber&#x27;s vacated seat at Minardi was filled by Justin Wilson, who had won the International Formula 3000 title in 2001. Alex Yoong&#x27;s Minardi contract from 2002 was not renewed and he moved to the CART series, albeit only for a brief stint, in 2003. He was replaced at Minardi by Jos Verstappen, who had spent a season on the sidelines after losing his Arrows drive to Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 2002.

====Mid-season changes====
* Minardi&#x27;s Justin Wilson joined Jaguar from the German Grand Prix onwards, filling in for the under-performing Antônio Pizzonia, who was offered a test driving role at the team but turned it down. He would later resurface as a test driver at Williams. Wilson&#x27;s seat at Minardi was taken by the Danish driver Nicolas Kiesa, who joined Formula One from the International Formula 3000 series.
* Ralph Firman suffered injuries as a result of a crash during practice in Hungary. He was replaced by Zsolt Baumgartner for the Italian Grand Prix before returning to finish the season for Jordan. Baumgartner, another driver who had been competing in the International Formula 3000 series, was the first Hungarian driver to race in Formula One.
* Ralf Schumacher was unable to race in Italy, due to concussion. He was replaced at Williams by Marc Gené, the team&#x27;s test driver, for that particular race, before returning for the following Grand Prix.
* After a string of disappointing results in 2003, Jacques Villeneuve elected to end his season one race early, and was replaced at BAR by test driver Takuma Sato for the Japanese Grand Prix. Villeneuve would later drive for Renault in 2004 as a replacement driver, and sign a multi-year contract at Sauber for 2005 (though he was replaced in 2006).

==Calendar==
The 2003 FIA Formula One World Championship was contested over the following sixteen races:

The Belgian Grand Prix scheduled for 31 August was cancelled due to a row over tobacco advertising, despite multiple races taking place without such advertising.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* On 26 June 2002, the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) declared that the HANS (&#x27;Head and Neck Support&#x27;) device would be made compulsory in Formula 1. This was not without controversy, as many drivers voiced their complaints, including Rubens Barrichello, Jacques Villeneuve, Justin Wilson and Nick Heidfeld.
* On 26 February 2003, the FIA decided that no fuel could be added to or removed from the cars between qualifying and race. This was decided based on safety grounds, as it would avoid the danger that, in a search for extra performance in qualifying, teams would run their cars in a manner which might be unsuitable or even dangerous at the start of the race.
*Hydraulic power-assisted rack and pinion steering system became mandatory for all Formula One entrants due to manual rack and pinion steering system deemed too difficult to cornering for drivers.
The 2003 season is notable for being the third and last season that fully-automatic gearboxes and launch control were allowed to be used. Both electronic driver aids had been used since the 2001 Spanish Grand Prix, but a change in the technical regulations saw the FIA banning both systems for 2004. The ban on traction control was ultimately delayed until the season.

===Sporting regulations===
* After Ferrari&#x27;s infamous decision during the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, ordering Rubens Barrichello to let Michael Schumacher by, any team orders which interfered with a race result were prohibited from the 2003 season onwards.
* Only one type of wet weather tyre was allowed to be used in wet weather races. This immediately raised concerns with the tyre suppliers. And after the chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix, in which drivers tried to call off the first qualifying session and which saw six drivers crash in the same corner, this rule was scrapped.

Furthermore, the 2003 season saw the introduction of new regulations intended to increase F1&#x27;s excitement, to halt falling global television audiences that had occurred during the previous season, and to help alleviate the financial difficulties of the smaller teams:
* One-lap qualifying was introduced as a way for smaller teams to get more television exposure. In the qualifying session on Friday, drivers would go out in current championship order, to determine the running order on Saturday. A faster lap time on Friday would mean a later starting time for them on Saturday. On Saturday, drivers contested for their starting position in the race on Sunday, with the fastest driver awarded pole position. In both sessions, drivers could only do one timed lap.
* Optional Friday testing at Grand Prix events was introduced in exchange for fewer miles on stand-alone test days. This was intended to give smaller teams a cheaper alternative to these test days, which were to be banned in 2004.
* The points system for both the Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; titles was changed from 10–6–4–3–2–1 for the first six finishers at each round to 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 for the first eight finishers in an attempt to make the title contests closer.

==Season summary==

===Rounds 1 to 3===
Going into the season, Ferrari was the team to beat, having won the previous four Constructors&#x27; Championships. There was a lot of speculation about the effect of the new regulations on their dominance and overall form.

In qualifying for the first race, the Australian Grand Prix, nothing seemed to have changed at the front. Reigning Drivers&#x27; Champion Michael Schumacher started in pole position, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello beside him. Juan Pablo Montoya in the Williams started in third, but the other Williams and McLaren drivers (Ferrari&#x27;s main rivals in ) started way further down the grid. So the new qualifying format did shake up the order somewhat. After heavy rainfall, the race started in half-wet conditions. The Ferraris started on wet tyres, while Montoya started on dries, as did Kimi Räikkönen at the last minute when he pitted on the end of the formation lap and, thus, started in last place. While Schumacher led away, Barrichello jumped the start and received a drive-through penalty. The track was drying quickly and the changeable conditions took some by surprise: Barrichello crashed on lap five, followed by rookies Ralph Firman and Cristiano da Matta. After two safety car periods, it was last-starting Räikkönen that found himself in the lead of the race, followed by Schumacher and McLaren teammate David Coulthard. During the second round of pit stops, the Ferrari retook the lead and Räikkönen fell back to third, having sped in the pit lane and being served a drive-through penalty. Soon, however, Schumacher sustained damage from a curb stone and received a black-and-orange flag, forcing him to pit for repairs. He fell down to fourth behind Räikkönen, missing out on the podium for the first time since the 2001 Italian Grand Prix. (It also ended Ferrari&#x27;s podium streak since the 1999 European Grand Prix.) It was Montoya who picked up the scraps, until he spun at the first corner and saw Coulthard pass him for the win. (This would be the Scot&#x27;s last race victory.)

At the Malaysian Grand Prix, it was the Renault team that blocked out the first row. Fernando Alonso, being the then-youngest driver to achieve pole position, started ahead of Jarno Trulli. Michael Schumacher started in third and tried to pass Trulli into the first corner, but tapped him into a spin. The Italian rejoined in last place, but Schumacher had to pit for repairs and was given a driving-through penalty on top of that. His main rivals were just as unlucky: Montoya was rear-ended by Jaguar driver Antônio Pizzonia and lost two laps during a rear-wing replacement, while Coulthard had to retire on the second lap when his car&#x27;s electronics failed. Räikkönen took the lead, ahead of Alonso and Barrichello. During the second round of pit stops, Barrichello took second place, but Räikkönen was unchallenged, scored his first career win and took the lead in the championship. Justin Wilson, driving for Minardi, had to retire when his HANS device got loose and pinched his shoulders, resulting in temporary paralysis of both his arms. (He recovered before the next race.)

Practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix was held in torrential weather conditions. For qualifying, it was no different, and the majority of drivers signed a petition, mandating the FIA to cancel the session if track conditions did not improve. When the rain eased off, however, the session went ahead as planned. The second qualifying session on Saturday was held in warm and dry conditions. Rubens Barrichello achieved pole position for Ferrari. Behind him stood David Coulthard for McLaren and a surprising Mark Webber for Jaguar. On Sunday, the rain was back and even under safety car conditions, drivers struggled to keep the car on track. When the field was released, Coulthard immediately overtook Barrichello, and in the next three laps, Räikkönen passed both of them to take the lead. The track began to dry, except for turn three, where a stream of water was running across the asphalt. Over the course of the race, six drivers crashed when going through that corner, including Michael Schumacher. This led to four safety car interventions. When a lot of drivers had to pit for fuel, Kimi Räikkönen and Giancarlo Fisichella became the leading pair and the Jordan driver overtook the McLaren when he ran wide. It was expected that Coulthard would win after those two had done their stops, but then, Webber and Alonso crashed heavily and the race was stopped. Alonso sustained bruises and was kept in hospital for observation. The sporting regulations said to take the order from two laps before the race suspension as the final result, and Räikkönen was declared the winner. When the FIA found a timekeeping error, however, this was corrected and Fisichella was awarded his first-ever win in an unofficial ceremony ahead of the next race.

After three eventful races, Räikkonen (McLaren) was leading the championship with 24 points, ahead of his teammate Coulthard (15 points) and Alonso (Renault, 14 points). Reigning champion Michael Schumacher was down in sixth place.

===Rounds 4 to 8===

For the San Marino Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher achieved pole position. His brother Ralf and his teammate Rubens Barrichello started behind him. At the start, Ralf overtook Michael but eventually fell back to fourth position. The Ferrari driver won the race, ahead of championship leader Räikkönen and Barrichello.

The next race in Spain saw Ferrari debut their new car and their drivers taking up the front row in qualifying. Behind them were the Renaults of Fernando Alonso and Jarno Trulli. At the start, Alonso overtook Barrichello for second and the top three went on to finish in this order. Trulli made contact with David Coulthard and retired. Räikkönen crashed into the stalled Jaguar of Antônio Pizzonia.

In Austria, Michael Schumacher started on pole and won the race. It was the third consecutive weekend that he achieved this. He did have to cope with a slow pit stop and small fire, but he was unchallenged by his rivals, as Räikkönen slowed down with engine-related performance problems and Montoya retired with a blown engine. The Finn held on to second, ahead of Barrichello in third.

The twisty track of Monaco favoured the Michelin runners: Ralf Schumacher (Williams) started on pole, ahead of Kimi Räikkönen (McLaren) and Juan Pablo Montoya (Williams). The race featured no on-track overtakes, so the order was decided by the start and the pit stops. Montoya took the win, just six tenths ahead of Räikkönen, and Michael Schumacher completed the podium. Ralf finished in fourth.

In Canada, Ralf Schumacher started on pole again, with his teammate beside him. Michael Schumacher started in third, but during the race, managed to get ahead of both Williams drivers. It was a race of attrition, where just nine drivers finished and Schumacher, too, had to nurse his ailing car home. But the German held on to take the win.

Recovering from his start to the season, Schumacher had taken the lead in the championship (54 points) and was now three points ahead of Kimi Räikkönen (51). A group of four drivers, led by Fernando Alonso (34 points), were fighting over third place.

===Rounds 9 to 13===

The European Grand Prix, held at the Nürburgring, saw Kimi Räikkönen take pole position and lead the race, until his McLaren&#x27;s engine broke down on lap 25. Ralf Schumacher in the Williams came through to take a victory on home soil. His teammate Juan Pablo Montoya and his brother Michael Schumacher collided on lap 43, dropping the German down to sixth. Montoya held on to take second on the podium, ahead of Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello. Williams overtook McLaren for second position in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

At the Circuit de Magny-Cours in France, Ralf Schumacher started from pole, with Montoya and Michael Schumacher behind him. This was also the order of the top three at the finish. This would be Ralf&#x27;s last win in F1 and, as of 2023, Williams&#x27; last 1-2 finish.

For the British Grand Prix, it was Rubens Barrichello who achieved pole position, but Jarno Trulli in the Renault who led into the first corner. There was a brief safety car intervention to clear up debris from David Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren, but the race was truly disrupted when, on lap 11, Neil Horan invaded the track. Wearing a kilt and waving religious banners, he ran towards the cars, who swerved to avoid him. A track marshal tackled him and pulled him to the side. The safety car was deployed and almost everyone pitted. Among others, Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Juan Pablo Montoya fell outside the top ten. The Toyota drivers Cristiano da Matta and Olivier Panis opted not to pit and took the lead, ahead of Coulthard. It was Räikkönen, eventually, who passed Da Matta for the lead. Under pressure from Rubens Barrichello, however, the Finn made a mistake and gave up the win. A further error allowed Montoya to get by into second position.
The F1 circus was back in Germany, this time for the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim. Montoya achieved pole position, just 0.018 seconds ahead of his teammate. At the start, Ralf Schumacher squeezed Räikkönen and Barrichello, who hit each other and crashed out, with Ralf retiring a lap later. He was charged with a ten-place grid penalty, but this was reversed after a successful appeal. Montoya held on to win, ahead of Coulthard and Trulli, the Renault driver scoring his only podium of the season.

The last race of the summer was held on the revamped Hungaroring in Hungary. Alonso scored pole position and held on to win the race. It was his first victory and it made him the youngest winning driver in F1 history. Räikkönen and Montoya joined him on the podium, while Michael Schumacher could only manage eighth.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Räikkönen (70 points) and Montoya (71 points) had closed up to Schumacher (72 points), leaving no room for error with just three races to go. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, it was now the Williams team in the lead with 129 points, over Ferrari with 121 and McLaren with 115.

===Rounds 14 to 16===

On home soil at Monza, with the support of the tifosi, the Scuderia Ferrari did what they had to do: Michael Schumacher qualified on pole and won. Juan Pablo Montoya for Williams and Michael&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello joined him on the podium. Up to the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, this was the shortest-duration (fully completed) race in F1 history, and it is still the race completed with the highest-ever average speed ().
Kimi Räikkönen had not given up his championship hopes and achieved pole position for the United States Grand Prix. Barrichello managed second and Olivier Panis scored Toyota&#x27;s best qualifying result when he set the third-fastest time. Montoya and Schumacher started in fourth and seventh, respectively. Räikkönen made a clean start, but Barrichello was passed by Panis when his launch control failed to automatically shift up to second gear. Montoya was falling back and, on the third lap, collided with Barrichello, earning himself a drive-through penalty. Rain started falling and on lap 6, Panis was the first to switch to intermediate tyres. On the next lap, Montoya was back behind Schumacher and, on his second attempt, managed to overtake him. As the rain eased up, all drivers that had pitted, switched back to dry tyres, only for the rain to reappear on lap 18. Schumacher decided to pit and stay on dry tyres, but then came in again on lap 22 for intermediates. Mark Webber shortly led the race before crashing out, with the same happening to then-leader David Coulthard. On lap 38, Schumacher had passed all drivers in front of him and held on to take the win. Championship rival Räikkönen came home in second, followed by Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber.

Montoya finished sixth, which meant he was now out of contention for the championship. Räikkönen&#x27;s only hope was to win the last race of the season and Schumacher failing to finish. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari was leading Williams with 147 over 144 points.

The Japanese Grand Prix saw Michael Schumacher qualify in 14th, his worst grid position in a Ferrari. Kimi Räikkönen started in 8th, so he faced an uphill battle to take the win that he needed. Rubens Barrichello started on pole, with Montoya beside him. The Toyota&#x27;s commenced their home race in third and fourth. On the first lap, Fernando Alonso in the Renault jumped up to third and Montoya took the lead. Schumacher was careful to stay out of trouble at the start, looking to score at least one point, but when trying to overtake Takuma Sato, he hit the local driver&#x27;s rear wheel and lost his front wing. This forced him to pit and he rejoined in last place. This practically handed the Constructors&#x27; Championship to Williams, until Montoya suddenly retired with a hydraulics problem. Schumacher narrowly avoided a replication of his incident at the chicane, this time with Cristiano da Matta, but it led to his brother Ralf running into the back of him. All this left Räikkönen unchallenged to climb up to second position. But in the end, Barrichello took the win and Schumacher finished eighth, so the German clinched the title.

Michael Schumacher ended the season on 93 points, ahead of Kimi Räikkönen with 91 and Juan Pablo Montoya with 82. It was a record sixth Drivers&#x27; Championship and Schumacher&#x27;s fourth in a row. Ferrari were Constructors&#x27; Champions for the fifth consecutive year.

<text>(, OSE: 8002, NSE: 8002) is a &quot;sōgō shōsha&quot; (general trading company) headquartered in Nihonbashi, Chuo, Tokyo, Japan. It is one of the largest &quot;sogo shosha&quot; and has leading market shares in cereal and paper pulp trading as well as a strong electrical and industrial plant business. Marubeni is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu.

==History==
Marubeni was founded in 1858, where the founder Chubei Itoh moved out of the family business and started a linen trading business with his uncle. It was established in 1918 as Itochu Shoten, Ltd. in a spin-off of certain sales divisions of C. Itoh &amp; Co. (Itochu) into a separate entity. Itochu Shoten merged with Itoh Chobei Shoten in 1921 to form Marubeni Shoten, Ltd. under the leadership of Chobei Itoh IX. Marubeni started out as a textile trading firm and expanded to trade in other consumer and industrial goods during the 1920s.

Marubeni was re-combined with Itochu during World War II to form Sanko Kabushiki Kaisha Ltd. (1941–44) and Daiken Company, Ltd. (1944–48). This conglomerate was dismantled in the wake of the war and Marubeni again emerged as a separate trading company in 1949. Post-war Marubeni was predominantly a textile trading firm at its outset, but diversified into machinery, metals and chemicals, with textiles barely forming a majority of its business by the end of the decade.

Marubeni merged with Takashimaya-Iida, a trading company that owned the Takashimaya department store chain, in 1955, changing its name to Marubeni-Iida from 1955 to 1972. The merger was orchestrated by Fuji Bank in order to create a stronger trading company partner for the bank&#x27;s corporate customers. Marubeni and Fuji Bank developed a network of corporate clients which was formalized as the Fuyo Group &quot;keiretsu&quot; in the 1960s, paralleling the development of the DKB Group and Sanwa Group. The Fuyo Group included Hitachi, Nissan, Canon, Showa Denko, Kubota and Nippon Steel.

Marubeni, like other &quot;sogo shosha&quot;, was hit hard by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s and recorded its first annual net loss in 1998. The company again booked massive losses as part of a restructuring in 2001, with its stock price plummeting to 58 yen per share in December 2001.

Marubeni acquired a large minority stake in the Daiei supermarket chain in 2006, which it sold to Æon Group in 2013.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange recognized Marubeni as the best Japanese company at increasing enterprise value in 2013, citing management&#x27;s efforts to maximize return on equity.

In September 2018, The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Marubeni Corporation and Russia&#x27;s AEON Corporation agreed to develop an industrial facility in Volgograd. The total investment is estimated at over $800 million with construction due to start in 2020.

In September 2018, Marubeni announced to shift from coal to renewable energy resources.

Berkshire Hathaway acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020.

In October 2021, Marubeni invested in B2U Storage Solutions, a Santa Monica-based startup that reuses EV batteries to a battery storage system.

In January 2022, Marubeni won the sea bed right of the Scotland to construct an offshore wind farm. They have partnered with SSE Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. Aside of Scotland, Marubeni is working on Japan&#x27;s first offshore wind farm as well as floating turbine demonstrations.

==Offices==
Marubeni&#x27;s head office moved to the Tokyo Nihombashi Tower (ja) in 2016. The company constructed a new dedicated head office building in 2021 and moved back to the original place in Chiyoda.
The company has a total of twelve offices in Japan, 58 overseas offices and 29 overseas subsidiaries with 33 offices.

The head office of Marubeni in Otemachi (Tokyo) operates the Marubeni Gallery museum, which holds exhibitions mainly of textiles and paintings. The Marubeni Gallery also publishes books about its exhibitions.

== Scandals and incidents ==
In the early 1970s Marubeni was accused of hoarding rice on the black market for profiteering purposes. In 1976, numerous Marubeni and All Nippon Airways executives were arrested in connection with the bribery of Japanese government officials to support the sales of Lockheed aircraft in Japan; the scandal also led to several suicides and the arrest of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In 1986, Marubeni was found to have bribed Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos and several of his friends and associates in connection with Japanese ODA work in the Philippines.

In January 2012, Marubeni Corporation agreed to pay a US$54.6 million criminal penalty to settle multiple US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges relating to its work as an agent for the TSKJ joint venture. The TSKJ joint venture comprising Technip, Snamprogetti Netherlands, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR) and JGC Corporation hired Marubeni to bribe lower-level Nigerian government officials to help it achieve contracts to build LNG facilities on Bonny Island in Nigeria. TSKJ paid Marubeni US$51 million which was intended, in part, to be used toward Nigerian officials. Two years later, and just months after its final settlement in the Nigerian case, Marubeni was charged under the FCPA for bribing Indonesian officials in order to secure a $118 million power project contract for a joint venture between Marubeni and Alstom; it agreed to pay an $88 million fine in connection with this case.

Marubeni Corporation continued its business operations in Russia despite international sanctions and geopolitical tensions following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. The company’s decision to maintain activities in the region attracted criticism from organizations advocating for ethical corporate practices during global conflicts.

<doc id="1132588" wikidata="Q69844" url="?curid=1132588" title="2002 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 56th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 2002 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 2002 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a seventeen-race series that commenced on 3 March and ended on 13 October.

Defending champions Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari were again awarded the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship, respectively. Schumacher finished first or second in every race except for the Malaysian Grand Prix, where he finished third, thus achieving a podium position in every race. He won a then-record eleven Grands Prix, surpassing the previous record of nine wins, jointly held by himself (, and ) and Nigel Mansell (). He also set the record for the largest number of races remaining on the calendar when the Drivers&#x27; Championship was clinched, securing the title with six races to go in the season.

Schumacher took the trophy home by a then-record 67-point margin over teammate Rubens Barrichello, beating his own record from the previous year (58 points over David Coulthard) and also collected the highest points total in a season thus far (144 points), again beating his own record (123 points in ). With their two drivers, Ferrari secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship with a points total that equalled the combined sum of points attained by all other constructors collectively. This domination, coupled with a resulting decline in viewing figures, resulted in a major overhaul of the championship&#x27;s sporting regulations for the following season. This season marked the debut of future Grand Prix winners, Felipe Massa and Mark Webber. 

==Teams and drivers==

The following teams and drivers competed in the 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship.

† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

===Team changes===

* The Prost team was placed into receivership in November 2001, and was liquidated by the receivers in January 2002. This ended the long history of the team which had competed as Ligier from to and as Prost Grand Prix from the following year. The absence of Prost meant that the car numbers 18 and 19 were left unoccupied for the season. Phoenix Finance bought the remains of Prost Grand Prix and attempted to enter Formula One starting at the Malaysian Grand Prix with former Minardi drivers Gastón Mazzacane and Tarso Marques. However, their entry was rejected by the FIA for not purchasing all of the Prost team. They still attempted to race at Malaysia, but race officials prevented them from competing in the event, even with a court appeal.
* Japanese auto maker Toyota entered the championship as a full works team, after much development work in 2001.
* The Benetton team had been sold to Renault in 2000, and was renamed &quot;Renault F1&quot; for 2002. The team did not substantially change apart from the name, as Benetton had been running a car with Renault engines since 1995.
* Asiatech, who had supplied engines to Arrows in 2001, switched their supply to Minardi for 2002. This replaced Minardi&#x27;s Cosworth engines (rebadged as European) from the previous season. Completing what was effectively a straight swap, Arrows signed a deal with Cosworth to use their engines for 2002.

====Mid-season changes====
* The Arrows team suffered financial collapse after the German Grand Prix, and did not take part in any of the remaining races. An attempt to register for the 2003 season was rejected by the FIA.

===Driver changes===
The 2002 season featured several driver line-up changes before the season and more changes during the season proper.
* With three races left to go in the 2001 season, 1998 and 1999 World Champion Mika Häkkinen announced that he was not intending to drive in F1 in 2002. Denying any claim of retirement, he stated that he needed a sabbatical and would return to McLaren at a later time. Häkkinen later officially left McLaren and retired from F1 at the end of 2001, eventually returning to racing in DTM in 2005, despite being linked with the Williams team for a Formula One comeback. Häkkinen&#x27;s seat at McLaren was taken by his fellow Finn Kimi Räikkönen, after he was released by Sauber. Räikkönen was replaced at Sauber by the 2001 Euro Formula 3000 champion Felipe Massa.
* Midway through 2001, Giancarlo Fisichella announced his intention to leave Benetton after 2001 to drive for Jordan. Benetton, renamed as Renault, replaced Fisichella with Jordan driver Jarno Trulli, meaning that Fisichella and Trulli had swapped seats at the two teams. Jordan completed an all-new lineup for 2002 with BAR test driver Takuma Sato, whose position in the large test driver pool at BAR was taken by compatriot Ryo Fukuda. Jean Alesi, who had driven for Jordan at the end of the 2001 season, did not seriously pursue an F1 drive for 2002 and instead signed up a drive with Mercedes in the DTM series. Ricardo Zonta, realising that he had no future at Jordan, left his reserve seat there to drive in the Telefonica World Series, later returning to F1 in 2003 as a test driver for Toyota.
* Heinz-Harald Frentzen, without a drive after the collapse of Prost, joined the Arrows team for 2002. This was his third different team within two seasons, after having been dumped by Jordan mid-season in 2001 and subsequently joining Prost until that team&#x27;s collapse. Despite being under contract for another season, Jos Verstappen lost his Arrows seat to Frentzen, and the Dutchman was unable to secure a drive at another team. He later resurfaced at Minardi in 2003.
* Fernando Alonso left Minardi after an impressive 2001 campaign, and signed on with Renault as a test driver. Alonso&#x27;s seat was taken over by Benetton test driver, and International Formula 3000 series runner-up, Mark Webber.
* For their first season in Formula One, Toyota employed Mika Salo (formerly with Sauber in ) and debutant Allan McNish, who had previously driven a Toyota GT-One at Le Mans.
* Luciano Burti, who had driven for both Jaguar and Prost in 2001, left the struggling Prost team before their collapse in order to join Luca Badoer in a test role at Ferrari. Tomáš Enge, who had filled in for the injured Burti at Prost in 2001, was dropped by the team at the end of the 2001 season for financial reasons, and he returned to International Formula 3000 for 2002.
* Antônio Pizzonia was signed to become a Williams test driver alongside Marc Gené. Pizzonia had been driving a Williams sponsored car in the International F3000 series in 2001, and he continued that drive in 2002 along with his test duties at Williams.
* André Lotterer, who drove for the Jaguar Junior Team in the British Formula 3 series in 2001, was signed as a test driver for Jaguar&#x27;s Formula One team for 2002.

====Mid-season changes====
* Heinz-Harald Frentzen decided to leave Arrows following the German Grand Prix due to the uncertain future of that team. Arrows collapsed several days later and did not take part in the rest of the season, which also left Enrique Bernoldi without a drive. Frentzen signed with Sauber for the 2003 season, and stood in for Felipe Massa in the United States Grand Prix, for which the Brazilian had incurred a 10-position penalty from the previous race in Monza, thereby eliminating Massa&#x27;s penalty.
* BAR test driver Anthony Davidson made his Formula One debut when he replaced Alex Yoong at Minardi for the Hungarian and Belgian Grands Prix. The team suspended the Malaysian after he failed to qualify for the third occasion in 2002. Minardi had planned to replace Yoong with Justin Wilson, but Wilson was too tall to fit into the car in accordance with the safety requirements.

==Regulation changes==
For 2002, there were only minor changes in the technical regulations.

* For safety reasons, the rear view mirrors and rear lights had to be made larger and the rear crash structure was subjected to increased impact tests.
* Data transfer between the car on track and the crew in the garage could now occur both ways. This would allow the team to adjust settings in the car&#x27;s electronics during the race, without the driver having to use the buttons on his steering wheel.

==Calendar==
The 2002 calendar features the same seventeen Grands Prix as the previous season.

<text>The 2001 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 55th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 2001 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 2001 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a seventeen-race series that commenced on 4 March and ended on 14 October.

Defending champions Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari were again awarded the World Drivers&#x27; Championship and World Constructors&#x27; Championship, respectively. Schumacher won the title with a record margin of 58 points over David Coulthard (McLaren), after achieving nine victories and five-second places. He also became the driver the most wins thus far, his victory at the Belgian Grand Prix marking his 52nd career win. The season saw the debut of two future world champions: Fernando Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen as well as it being the last season for double world champion Mika Häkkinen.

==Teams and drivers==

The following teams and drivers competed in the 2001 FIA Formula One World Championship.
† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

===Driver changes===
* Olivier Panis left his test position with McLaren to take up a full-time drive with BAR. He took the place of Ricardo Zonta, with the Brazilian taking up the position of test driver with Jordan.
* Still on contract to Williams, Jenson Button was loaned to Benetton for this season. He replaced Alexander Wurz, as the Austrian had fallen out of favour with team boss Flavio Briatore and moved on to become a test driver at McLaren. Button&#x27;s place in the Williams was taken over by Juan Pablo Montoya. Montoya had been tied to Williams since 1998 but was loaned to Chip Ganassi Racing to drive in the CART series in 1999, where he took the title in his first attempt as well as a victory in the Indianapolis 500.
* Marc Gené lost his seat at Minardi due to sponsorship problems. He signed a contract to become a test driver at Williams, where he remained until the end of 2004. His place at Minardi was replaced with Fernando Alonso. Gastón Mazzacane was replaced by Tarso Marques, returning after previously driving for the team in and .
* Mazzacane beat CART driver Oriol Servià for the seat at Prost. He replaced Nick Heidfeld, who subsequently moved to Sauber. Kimi Räikkönen was signed alongside Heidfeld for a full drive from near obscurity. The Finn had performed some testing for Sauber in late 2000 after dominating the British Formula Renault series, and an impressed Peter Sauber offered him the full-time drive. Pedro Diniz did not return as a driver for Sauber, but instead purchased 40% of the Prost team and served in a management role there in 2001. 
* Johnny Herbert decided to leave the Jaguar team in an attempt to secure a drive in Champ Cars. The deal did not work out and he was forced to sign on with Arrows as a test driver for 2001. Luciano Burti stepped up from test driver to fill Herbert&#x27;s slot at Jaguar. 
* Pedro de la Rosa lost his drive at Arrows to Enrique Bernoldi and signed on as a reserve driver with Prost.

====Mid-season changes====

* Gastón Mazzacane was fired by the Prost team after the San Marino Grand Prix. He was replaced with Jaguar&#x27;s Luciano Burti, who was subsequently replaced with Prost reserve driver Pedro de la Rosa.
* Heinz-Harald Frentzen suffered injuries after a crash and was replaced for the Canadian GP by reserve driver Ricardo Zonta. After returning from his injuries, Frentzen&#x27;s contract was terminated by Jordan after the British GP. The split was not a happy one, and the matter ended in court before the season&#x27;s end. Zonta took over Frentzen&#x27;s drive for the German GP.
* Jean Alesi quit his Prost drive after the German Grand Prix. Frentzen was then signed to Prost to take over from Alesi, before Jordan completed a straight swap by signing Alesi. Both drivers remained in their new seats for the rest of the season.
* Alex Yoong was granted his FIA super-licence during the 2001 season and replaced Tarso Marques in the Minardi starting lineup at the Italian Grand Prix. Marques moved into a reserve/test role for the rest of the season.
* Luciano Burti suffered serious injuries during a crash in the Belgian GP. He was forced to sit out the rest of the season and was replaced by Czech driver Tomáš Enge for the remaining races.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* The front wing had to be moved upwards by , to be at least above the &quot;reference plane&quot; (imaginary line along the bottom of the car). This was done to reduce the ground effect and overall downforce at the front of the car.
* The upper section of the rear wing could now only consist out of a maximum of three elements, and the lower point out of just one element.
* The safety cell and cockpit opening were increased in size to reduce damage to drivers&#x27; legs, and the roll hoop structure (above the driver&#x27;s head) had to withstand a four times larger force of impact compared to last year. The side impact test was conducted at a higher speed: instead of .
* Tyres had to be connected to the suspension with two tethers, up from one.

====Mid-season changes====
* Several electronic driver-aid systems were reintroduced: traction control, launch control, and fully-automatic transmissions. They had been banned since . The Spanish Grand Prix was the first race where they were permitted.

===Sporting regulations===
* On 30 August 2000, the eleven teams held a meeting with members of the FIA at Heathrow Airport to discuss rule changes for the 2001 season. It was agreed that drivers would be allowed to use an extra three sets of tyres during Friday&#x27;s two practice sessions.
* Ten days later at the Monza Circuit, team bosses accepted to ban in-season testing during the month of August, from the 2001 season onwards. A three-week break would be implemented during that time period.

===Safety car===
Mercedes-Benz provided a new safety car: the SL55 AMG, which also performed its duty during and replaced the previous CL55 AMG. It was first deployed during the German Grand Prix.

==Season summary==

===Pre-season===
Three high-profile drivers made their debuts in 2001: future world champions Fernando Alonso (with Minardi) and Kimi Räikkönen (with Sauber), and former CART champion Juan Pablo Montoya (with Williams).

Renault returned to Formula One after three years to supply engines to the Benetton team. Meanwhile, fellow French car manufacturer Peugeot withdrew from the sport after seven years, following a disastrous season as engine supplier to Prost. The assets of Peugeot&#x27;s Formula One programme were purchased by Asia Motor Technologies France. The 2000-spec powerplants were rebadged as Asiatechs and supplied to Arrows free of charge.

Michelin made a comeback as tyre supplier, providing competition to Bridgestone for the first time since Goodyear left the sport at the end of the 1998 season.

===Rounds 1 to 4===
Michael Schumacher started the new season where he had left off the year before, with a dominant win from pole position in the first race in Australia. Arch-rival Mika Häkkinen lost second after a suspension failure, giving second to his teammate David Coulthard, with Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello completing the podium. Kimi Räikkönen finished his first F1 race in the points with sixth place. The race was marred by the death of Graham Beveridge, a track marshal who was hit by debris after a collision between Ralf Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve.
Schumacher and Barrichello started 1–2 in Malaysia and maintained their positions at the first corner, but there was a massive rain shower on the second lap, during which both Ferraris went off the track. After everyone pitted to change tyres, they were down in 10th and 11th, but they changed to intermediate tyres, while all others had changed to full wets. This masterstroke meant that the Ferraris were able to charge back up the order and get back first and second. Schumacher won, with Barrichello completing a Ferrari 1–2, and Coulthard was third.

Schumacher was on pole in Brazil, but a collision on the first lap brought out the safety car. When the race restarted, Williams rookie Juan Pablo Montoya shocked Schumacher by coming up the inside of him and taking the lead. Montoya was well set for a stunning maiden win until he got hit from behind by Jos Verstappen while lapping him. It began to rain and after everyone changed the tyres, Schumacher was leading, but then Coulthard passed him on the first turn when they were lapping Tarso Marques in a move reminiscent of the one made by Mika Häkkinen on Schumacher in Belgium last year. Coulthard went on to win, with Schumacher and Nick Heidfeld second and third.

In Ferrari&#x27;s first &#x27;home&#x27; race in San Marino, their main rivals McLaren stunned them by qualifying 1–2, with Coulthard on pole. Schumacher was fourth behind his brother Ralf. Ralf shot to the lead at the start, passing both McLarens before the first corner, and was never headed. Coulthard finished second, with Barrichello jumping Häkkinen in the stops to take third. Michael Schumacher had a miserable afternoon, suffering a gearbox glitch early on and then having to retire after a puncture that damaged the wheel rim and a brake duct.

After four races, Schumacher and Coulthard were level on the standings with 26 points, Barrichello and Ralf were third with 14 and 12 points respectively. Häkkinen had only 4 and was only seventh in the standings. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 40, with McLaren second with 30. Williams was third with 12.

===Rounds 5 to 8===

The next round in Spain was the first after the reintroduction of traction control, launch control, and fully-automatic transmissions. The driving aids were brought back to ensure no teams were cheating, but questions were raised over the reliability. Their first victim was David Coulthard, who stalled on the grid and had to start from the back. The race saw a battle between Schumacher and Häkkinen, with the former winning pole and leading the opening two thirds of the race. During the second pit stop, however, Schumacher had a problem and lost the lead to Häkkinen, who then stretched his lead to half a minute, as Schumacher was struggling with a suspension problem. Ironically and shockingly, it was Häkkinen&#x27;s car that gave out on the last lap with a clutch failure, giving the win to Schumacher. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second and Jacques Villeneuve completed the podium. Coulthard recovered to fifth.
The sixth round took place in Austria, where the two Williams cars out-dragged polesitter Michael Schumacher into the first corner. His brother Ralf soon retired with a brake problem, leaving his teammate vulnerable to the Ferrari&#x27;s attack. Schumacher tried to pass Montoya, but instead, both went into the gravel and rejoined sixth and seventh. Coulthard took the lead by jumping Rubens Barrichello in the second round of stops, and held on to take the win. Barrichello had to yield second to a recovering Schumacher on the final lap.

Coulthard took pole at the Monaco GP but stalled on the grid after, again, suffering problems with the launch control system. This released the two Ferraris and Häkkinen to battle for the win. When Häkkinen&#x27;s engine failed early on, the Ferraris cruised to a 1–2 finish, with Schumacher winning ahead of Barrichello. The demise of the McLarens allowed Eddie Irvine to get a podium, while Coulthard recovered to fifth, despite spending the majority of the race stuck behind Enrique Bernoldi.
The race in Canada was a battle between the Schumacher brothers, with Michael taking pole and maintaining his lead at the first corner. Ralf, however, kept up with him, and when his brother pitted, upped the pace with a string of quick laps, and came out five seconds ahead. Ralf cruised to victory, with his brother making it the first time ever that brothers had finished 1–2 in a race. Häkkinen finished third, scoring his first podium of the season. Coulthard was set for third but retired when his engine failed 15 laps from the finish.

With nearly half the season complete, Schumacher had 58 points and led Coulthard by 18 points. Coulthard had a further 16 points over Barrichello who had 24 points, and 18 over Ralf, who had 22. Häkkinen was fifth in the standings with 8 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari with 82 points had a huge lead over McLaren, who had 48. Williams was third with 28.

===Rounds 9 to 12===
The European Grand Prix was next and the Schumacher brothers were in the spotlights again. Michael took his seventh pole position of the season, ahead of his brother. They maintained their positions at the start and Ralf was able to keep up in second during the first stint. However, he passed the white line after his first pit stop and received a stop-go penalty, which dropped him out of contention. This left Michael Schumacher to cruise to another victory, with Juan Pablo Montoya in second and David Coulthard in third. Ralf, even with his penalty, was able to get fourth ahead of Rubens Barrichello and Mika Häkkinen.

In France, the Schumacher brothers started 1–2 again, but it was Ralf who took his first-ever career pole. Ralf maintained his lead at the start, but his brother jumped him at the first round of stops and then pulled away. Coulthard, who had started third, was in contention until he went over the white line while coming out of the pit lane and received a stop-go penalty. Montoya was running quickly and could have challenged his teammate for a second, had his engine not blown up. Schumacher won comfortably from Ralf, with Barrichello holding off Coulthard for third.
Michael Schumacher took pole for the British GP and maintained his position at the first corner. But on the fifth lap, Häkkinen, who was on a two-stopper, passed him and never looked back to take a dominant first win of the year. Schumacher was over half a minute back in second and Barrichello completed the podium.

The weekend of the German GP was dominated by the Williams team and their drivers locked out the front row. This time, it was Montoya in first place, taking his first career pole. He kept the lead at the start and was looking well set to win until his engine blew up. This left Ralf Schumacher to cruise to victory. Barrichello took second and Jacques Villeneuve third, both of them capitalising on Michael Schumacher&#x27;s retirement with a fuel pressure problem and the fact that both McLarens retired with engine failure.

Schumacher now had no less than 84 points and it seemed inevitable that he would win the championship. A win in the next round in Hungary would be enough. Coulthard was a distant second with 47 and was looking anxiously over his shoulders, as Ralf with 41 and Barrichello with 37 were hot on his heels. Häkkinen and Montoya were fifth and sixth with 19 and 15 points respectively. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 121 compared to McLaren&#x27;s 66, and a 1–2 in Hungary would wrap up the title. Williams were third with 56, within touching distance of McLaren.

===Rounds 13 to 17===

After the summer break, Michael Schumacher took another step to winning the title by taking pole position at the Hungarian GP, ahead of David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello. He kept the lead at the start, but Coulthard was passed by Barrichello. Coulthard then jumped Barrichello at the first round of pit stops, only for the Brazilian to return the favour at the second round. Schumacher won the race and clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Barrichello came home in second, to make it a Ferrari 1–2 and secure the Constructors&#x27; Championship. A disappointed Coulthard finished third.

The two Williams cars of Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher qualified 1–2 for the Belgian GP, but Montoya stalled on the grid and started at the back and Ralf was passed by his brother and world champion Michael into the first corner. After a few laps, there was a collision between Eddie Irvine and Luciano Burti. Burti careered head-on into the tyre barrier and had to be treated for his injuries. While the injuries were not serious, Burti was never to race in F1 again. The race was suspended and shortened to 36 laps. At the restart, the top 3 were Michael Schumacher, his brother Ralf and Barrichello. However, Ralf&#x27;s car was still on its jacks when the warm-up lap started and he had to start at the back. Michael kept the lead at the start and pulled away, while Barrichello lost out to Giancarlo Fisichella. Barrichello lost further time when he ran over a bollard at the Bus Stop chicane and damaging his front wing, and he had to go around for an entire lap before he could pit and change the wing. This left the two McLarens pressuring Fisichella for second. David Coulthard was able to pass the Benetton with 10 laps left. Schumacher took his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost&#x27;s record of most wins ever, with Coulthard and Fisichella completing the podium.

The next round was in Italy. It was the first race after the September 11 attacks. Because of this, and also thinking of the horrific accident of Alessandro Zanardi in the Champ Car World Series the day before, Michael Schumacher asked all the drivers to go slowly at the first corner. This plan failed when Jacques Villeneuve and Benetton boss Flavio Briatore did not accept it. The Ferrari did adjust their livery: they ran without sponsors&#x27; logos, in deference to sponsor Philip Morris USA, and with a black tip on their nose, out of respect for the 9/11 victims. Montoya took pole, ahead of the two Ferraris of Barrichello and Schumacher. The top 3 maintained their positions at the start, but Montoya was soon passed by a two-stopping Barrichello. After utilising different strategies and Barrichello suffering a 7-second delay in his first stop, a jubilant Montoya came out on top to take his first career win. Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher finished second and third.
The US GP was host to the penultimate round and Schumacher took pole ahead of his brother and Montoya. Schumacher led into the first corner, while Ralf lost out to both Montoya and Barrichello. A two-stopping Barrichello soon took the lead and subsequently pitted. Montoya passed Michael Schumacher before the round of stops, but two laps after his stop, he retired with engine failure. At the half-way point, Barrichello was leading from Mika Häkkinen, Schumacher and Coulthard. He rejoined behind Häkkinen after his second stop, but started to close in, until his engine failed on the penultimate lap. Häkkinen took what would be his last win. Barrichello&#x27;s demise left Schumacher and Coulthard to take second and third.

The last round took place in Japan and Michael Schumacher took pole again, ahead of Montoya and Ralf. The top 3 kept their places into the first corner, but Ralf was soon passed by a three-stopping Barrichello. The Brazilian was unable to pass Montoya, however, and this ruined his strategy. Ralf was given a stop-go penalty for cutting the chicane at the last corner too frequently. This left Häkkinen running third in his last race in F1, but he handed the position to teammate Coulthard, as a token of gratitude. Schumacher capped off the season with a victory ahead of Montoya and Coulthard.

At the end of the season, Schumacher was a dominant champion with 123 points. Coulthard with 65 was a distant second (58 points behind). Barrichello was third with 56, which meant that Michael had collected more points than the second and third-placed drivers put together. Ralf Schumacher was fourth with 49, Häkkinen fifth with 37, and Montoya sixth with 31. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari was the winner with 179 points, 77 ahead of second-placed McLaren with 102, and Williams was third with 80 points.

===Post-season===
During the season, double world champion Mika Häkkinen had announced his intention to take a one-year sabbatical in 2002. Eventually, it became clear that it would be his full-time retirement. Also racing for the last time in 2001 was Jean Alesi, who passed the mark of 200 shortly before his final race in Japan.

Veteran British sports commentator Murray Walker provided his final commentary at the United States Grand Prix, where Häkkinen took home what would be his last win.

Finally, the Prost team folded at the end of the year due to a lack of finances, while Benetton was re-branded as Renault after the French manufacturer bought the team outright.

<doc id="1132596" wikidata="Q2460422" url="?curid=1132596" title="Guest house">
<text>A guest house (or guesthouse, also rest house) is a kind of lodging. In some parts of the world (such as the Caribbean), a guest house is a type of inexpensive hotel-like lodging. In others, it is a private home that has been converted for the exclusive use of visitor accommodation. The owner usually lives in an entirely separate area within the property and the guest house may be as a form of lodging business.

==Overview==

In some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives with whom to stay. Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel or inn is the lack of a full-time staff.

Under the 1956 Hotel Proprietor Act in the United Kingdom, while hotels have an obligation to accept travelers &quot;in a fit state&quot; if they have empty rooms, guest houses are allowed to be more selective.

Bed and breakfasts and guest houses in England are family-owned and the family lives on the premises, though family members are not normally available during the evening. However, most family members work a 10- to 12-hour day from 6 am as they may employ part-time service staff. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff presence. Because of this, check-in at a guest house is often by appointment. An inn also usually has a restaurant attached.

In India, a tremendous growth can be seen in the guest house business especially in Delhi-NCR (national capital region) where progress in the IT sector and the Commonwealth Games 2010 were the two most influential factors. Nowadays the guest house accommodation sector has improved significantly, with even a home converted guest house also offering 3-star equivalent facilities to its guests.

In the United States, the term guest house may refer to rooms in private homes.
== Security ==
Generally, there are two variations of paying guest house:
# Home converted guest house
# Professionally run guest house with all necessary amenities and staff
In the first version of the guest house, the guests get to live with a family where they get shelter and food (bed and breakfast) only, and for the rest of the jobs like washing clothes and utensils, cleaning of room or area around their bed is to be done by the guests. In the second version, the guests receive some amenities necessary to live life comfortably like a fully furnished room, comfortable bed, air-conditioner, television, water supply and, last but not least, security.

A big plus point of a professionally run paying guest accommodation service is that the owner follows the safety norms set by the local government. Some of the important safety points include:
* Fire safety with regular fire drills
* Disaster management
* Updated safety equipment
* Information signboards for guests and staff
* Government certifications

<text>A marketing board is an organization created by many producers to try to market their product and increase consumption and thus prices. It can also be defined as an organization set up by a government to regulate the buying and selling of a certain commodity within a specified area. They most commonly exist to help sell farm products such as milk, eggs, beef or tripe and are funded by the farmers or processors of those crops or products. Marketing boards often also receive funding from governments as an agricultural subsidy. The leadership and strategies of the marketing boards are set through votes by the farmers who are members of the board.

Marketing boards also sometimes act as a pool, controlling the price of farm products by forming a legal cartel. They also fund other ventures beneficial to their members such as research.

Marketing boards differ from industry trade groups in that their primary goal is marketing towards consumers, not governments, but they may also lobby on behalf of their supporters. Industry trade groups might also advertise directly to consumers.

<doc id="1132599" wikidata="Q254231" url="?curid=1132599" title="Mozambique national football team">
<text>The Mozambique national football team () represents Mozambique in men&#x27;s international football competitions and is controlled by the Mozambican Football Federation, the governing body for football in Mozambique. Mozambique have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, but they have qualified for five Africa Cup of Nations in 1986, 1996, 1998, 2010, and most recently 2023, being eliminated in the first round in all five. In 1997, the Mozambique Football Federation became a founding member of COSAFA.

Mozambique&#x27;s home ground is Estádio do Zimpeto in the capital city Maputo, and can hold 42,000 spectators. The team&#x27;s current head coach is Chiquinho Conde, who became manager in July 2019, replacing previous head coach and former Portugal international Abel Xavier, who had been in charge since February 2016.

==History==

===Beginnings===

On the day of independence in 1975, Mozambique played its first ever match; a friendly against Zambia, winning 2–1. Two years later, Cuba became Mozambique&#x27;s first non-African opponent when the two countries met in Mozambique, with Cuba winning 2–0. Mozambique entered World Cup qualifying for the first time in the 1982 qualifying competition. Mozambique were defeated 7–3 over two legs by Zaire in the first round.

===1986 Africa Cup of Nations===

Mozambique qualified for its first Africa Cup of Nations in 1986. In the qualifying competition they beat Mauritius, Malawi (on penalties), and finally Libya, winning again on penalties.

At the final tournament in Egypt, Mozambique were placed in Group A along with Senegal, Ivory Coast and hosts Egypt. They lost all their games 3–0, 2–0 and 2–0, not scoring a single goal.

===1996 Africa Cup of Nations===

Mozambique had to wait 10 years to qualify for another Africa Cup of Nations, as they qualified for the 1996 tournament in South Africa. They were placed in Group D along with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Tunisia. Mozambique played their first game against Tunisia in Port Elizabeth, drawing 1–1 with Tico-Tico scoring in the 4th minute. They then went on to lose 1–0 to Ivory Coast and 2–0 to Ghana, thus eliminating them from the tournament.

===1998 Africa Cup of Nations===

Two years later, Mozambique qualified for their third Africa Cup of Nations held in Burkina Faso. They were again placed in group D along with Morocco, Egypt and Zambia. Mozambique lost their first game against eventual tournament winners Egypt 2–0, both goals coming from Hossam Hassan. In their second game they again lost to Morocco 3–0, therefore eliminating them from the tournament with one game still remaining. In their last game against Zambia, they drew 1–1, their first goal of the tournament. This would prove to be their last African Cup of Nations game for 12 years.

===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification===


Mozambique entered the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in the second round, and were placed in Group 7 with Botswana, Madagascar and African football giants Ivory Coast. They made a terrible start to qualifying, losing to Ivory Coast and minnows Botswana 1–0 and 2–1, and drawing 1–1 with Madagascar. Mozambique then went on to beat Madagascar 3–0 in Antananarivo with goals coming from Tico-Tico, Carlitos and Domingues. They then drew 1–1 with Ivory Coast and beat Botswana 1–0 in Gaborone to qualify for the third Round.

Mozambique were one of the lowest seeded teams in the third round, and were placed in Group B with Nigeria, Tunisia and Kenya. They went on to draw their first game against giants Nigeria 0–0 in Maputo. They then went on to lose their next to games against Tunisia and Kenya 2–0 and 2–1, now making it a struggle to qualify for their first FIFA World Cup. In the next game, they beat Kenya 1–0 with Tico-Tico scoring, but then a loss to Nigeria eliminated them from qualifying. In the last game they beat Tunisia 1–0 in a victory that stopped Tunisia from qualifying. Despite not qualifying for the World Cup, this win was enough to secure third place and qualification for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations in Angola.

===2010 Africa Cup of Nations===

After a 12-year absence from Africa Cup of Nations football, Mozambique were placed in Group C with Egypt, Nigeria and Benin. In their first game, they played Benin, drawing 2–2 after being 2–0 down, with goals coming from Miro and Fumo. They then went on to lose 2–0 to eventual tournament winners Egypt and 3–0 to Nigeria, thus eliminating them from the tournament. After the tournament, all-time top scorer and captain Tico-Tico retired from international football.

===Recent years===

Mozambique have yet to reach a fifth AFCON Finals despite several close misses. During the 2013 qualifiers, they reached the final round and beat Morocco 2–0 in the first leg in Maputo. However, they were beaten 4–0 in Marrakech four days later. During the 2019 qualifiers the &quot;Mambas&quot; were only denied by a Guinea-Bissau equaliser in stoppage time at the end of their final Group K match.

<doc id="1132600" wikidata="Q69805" url="?curid=1132600" title="2000 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 2000 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 54th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It commenced on 12 March and ended on 22 October after seventeen races. Michael Schumacher became Ferrari&#x27;s first World Drivers&#x27; Champion in 21 years, having clinched the Drivers&#x27; title at the penultimate race of the season. Ferrari successfully defended its Constructors&#x27; title. This season marked the first for future world champion Jenson Button.

For the third year in succession, the season featured a close battle between Ferrari and McLaren. Schumacher won the first three races and dominated the first part of the season as McLaren had reliability issues. Then misfortune struck Schumacher, who retired from three consecutive races with both Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard scoring big. Häkkinen then surged to win two races in a row, leaving him six points clear of Schumacher who faced a fifth consecutive season at Ferrari without titles since 1996. Schumacher fought back winning the final four races of the season in convincing fashion, recording pole position on all those occasions. The title was sealed in Japan on 8 October, after a classic straight fight between Schumacher and Häkkinen, with Schumacher passing Häkkinen at the final pit stop and then holding out in front.

The season held the record for the smallest number of drivers competing in a single season with only one driver change (Luciano Burti deputising for an ill Eddie Irvine in Austria) putting the total at 23 (similar to 2002 season). This record stood until 2008, where there were no driver changes, although the Super Aguri F1 team withdrew in the middle of that season.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 2000 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Bridgestone.
† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

===Team changes===
* After being bought by Ford, the Stewart team was renamed Jaguar Racing, with the team&#x27;s engines rebadged as Cosworths. The Ford V10s used by Minardi in 1998 were rebadged as Fondmetal engines, in deference to Gabriele Rumi&#x27;s financial input to the team, and the car&#x27;s main colour was changed from blue and silver to a fluorescent yellow. The Ford name, ever-present on the Formula One grid since the debut of the Ford Cosworth DFV in 1967, was therefore absent for the 2000 season, although it would make a brief return in 2003 and 2004.
* Williams switched to BMW engines, replacing the Supertec units of the previous season. The contract, which had been signed back in 1998, marked BMW&#x27;s return to Formula One after over a decade of absence. BAR, who had also used Supertecs in 1999, signed a deal with Honda to use their engines for the 2000 season. Honda&#x27;s previous stint as an engine supplier had ended in 1992, when their highly successful collaboration with McLaren came to a conclusion.
* Following the departure of engine designer Brian Hart, who had been responsible for the team&#x27;s Hart, Yamaha and Arrows engines, the Arrows team switched to Supertec engines for 2000.

===Driver changes===
* Rubens Barrichello, who scored three podiums for Stewart in 1999, signed for Ferrari, replacing Eddie Irvine. The previous season&#x27;s runner-up joined the newly established Jaguar team, in what was essentially a straight swap with Barrichello.
* 1996 champion Damon Hill retired from Formula One at the end of the 1999 season. Jarno Trulli moved from Prost to Jordan, filling Hill&#x27;s vacant seat. Prost&#x27;s other driver Olivier Panis left the team to become the test driver for McLaren. The two seats at the French team were taken by Jean Alesi, who moved from Sauber, and 1999 International Formula 3000 champion Nick Heidfeld, who had previously been a test driver at McLaren. Mika Salo signed for Sauber after short spells as an injury replacement for Ricardo Zonta for three races and Michael Schumacher for six races in 1999.
* 2009 World Champion Jenson Button made his debut for Williams after beating the team&#x27;s test driver Bruno Junqueira in a &#x27;shoot-out&#x27; test. Button replaced Alessandro Zanardi at the team. The Italian returned to motor racing in 2001, when he rejoined the CART championship.
* Toranosuke Takagi left Formula One to drive for Nakajima Racing in Formula Nippon, where he won the 2000 title. His place at Arrows was taken by Jos Verstappen, whose previous Formula One race had been the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, when he was driving for Stewart.
* Gastón Mazzacane was promoted to a Minardi race drive for 2000, after spending the previous season as their test driver. The Argentine driver took the place of Luca Badoer, who was unable to find a race seat, and so focused on his role as test driver for Ferrari. Stéphane Sarrazin, who had driven for Minardi at the 1999 Brazilian Grand Prix, became the test driver for Prost.

;Mid-season changes
* Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti made his racing debut at Austria, replacing the ill Eddie Irvine.

==Regulation changes==
* To keep costs down, the V10 engine configuration was made fully mandatory in 2000 so that engine builders would not develop and experiment with other configurations but the V engine bank angle remained varied. The V10 configuration had been the most popular since the banning of turbocharged engines in 1989, and no other configuration had been used since 1998.
* A change to red flag procedure was introduced, where races stopped after two laps but before three-quarters race distance had been completed would be restarted with the cars lining up on the grid in the order they were at the end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the red flag was shown. Only the race order and number of laps completed were taken into account for the restarted race, with time differences between the cars voided; as such, the distance of the restarted race became the number of laps remaining from the original races, deducted by three.
* On 7 September, the FIA announced that using cooled fuel during a Grand Prix would be banned &quot;with immediate effect&quot;.
* This was the last full season for cars competing without traction control, launch control, and fully-automatic gearboxes, until the and seasons, respectively. (&quot;Note: Traction control was reintroduced five races into the season, at the Spanish Grand Prix.&quot;)

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The United States Grand Prix returned for 2000 after a nine-year absence being held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
* In a controversial move the FIA moved the British Grand Prix at Silverstone from its normal June/July date to 23 April. This was despite F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone trying to move French Grand Prix at Magny Cours to the same date.

==Report==

=== Rounds 1 to 4 ===
The main changes among the top teams were that Eddie Irvine was replaced by Rubens Barrichello at Ferrari and at Jordan, former world champion Damon Hill had retired, and was replaced by Jarno Trulli.

The first race of the season was in Australia, and the top five placings were similar to the previous year. The McLaren pair of world champion Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard started 1–2 ahead of the Ferrari pair of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. The Jordans of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jarno Trulli were fifth and sixth. During the race, the McLarens kept their positions at the start, while Barrichello lost out to Frentzen. The McLarens pulled away from Michael Schumacher, but on lap ten, Coulthard retired with a misfire. Häkkinen&#x27;s engine blew up nine laps later, giving the lead to Schumacher. Neither Jordan also lasted the race, Frentzen retiring with a hydraulic failure from second, and Trulli with an engine failure from fourth. All this gave Ferrari an easy 1–2 with Schumacher winning from Barrichello, with Ralf Schumacher, driving for Williams completing the podium.

For the second round in Brazil, the top four were the same again in qualifying, with Häkkinen and Coulthard starting 1–2 ahead of Michael Schumacher and Barrichello. Schumacher, who was on a two-stop strategy took the lead within two laps, built up a 20-second gap, and pitted. He rejoined in second, behind Häkkinen. Coulthard was suffering from gearbox problems, and so was not quick enough. Barrichello, who was also on a two-stopper was stuck behind Häkkinen for 15 laps, before passing him, and this compromised his race. He rejoined fourth after his stop, but his engine blew up soon after. Häkkinen was starting to edge away from Michael Schumacher, until he had to retire with an oil leak. This gave Schumacher the win, ahead of Coulthard and Giancarlo Fisichella. There was controversy after the race when all the drivers in the top six with the exception of Fisichella were excluded because of problems with their wooden floors. The teams appealed but when the FIA was scrutineering the cars again, they found out that the front wing endplates on Coulthard&#x27;s car were lower than they should have been. Thus, the position of everyone except for Coulthard was reinstated. The final top three were: Michael Schumacher, Fisichella and Frentzen. Notably, Jenson Button was sixth, and got his first ever championship point. He also set the record for the youngest F1 driver to score a point.

After two rounds, Michael Schumacher had a maximum 20 out of 20 points, and no one else had even ten, and notably both McLaren drivers had none. Second was Fisichella with 8, with Barrichello third with 6. Ferrari also had a big lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 26 points, the second being Benetton with 8, and the third being Williams with 7. McLaren had none.

The European season started off in San Marino, and Häkkinen took his third consecutive pole, with Michael Schumacher splitting the McLarens, and Barrichello was fourth. Häkkinen and Schumacher maintained their positions at the start, while Barrichello got past Coulthard. The race developed into a battle between Häkkinen and Schumacher, and quick in and out laps during the second round of pitstops enabled the latter to take the lead. Schumacher won, with Häkkinen second, and Coulthard third ahead of Barrichello.

Round four was in Britain, and in a wet-dry qualifying, Barrichello took his third pole position of his career, beating Frentzen by three-thousandth of a second, with the McLarens on the second row, Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher could manage only fifth. At the start, the top two got away well and kept their places, while Coulthard got ahead of his teammate, and Schumacher lost three places. Frentzen was on a two-stop strategy, and pitted, leaving Barrichello leading from Coulthard and Häkkinen. Barrichello kept a gap till his car started suffering from engine and hydraulic problems, and Coulthard took the lead on lap 30 with a superb passing manoeuvre on the outside at Stowe. He pitted two laps later, giving back the lead to the fading Barrichello. Barrichello hung around until lap 35 when he spun at Luffield, and drove his car to the pits only to find out his team weren&#x27;t ready. He waited until the stop was over, only to find out that he couldn&#x27;t restart the car as his hydraulics had completely failed. 
This left him with no option but to retire. Frentzen now led, but after his second stop he rejoined fourth behind the McLarens and the Ferrari of Schumacher. Frentzen&#x27;s gearbox failed 6 laps from the end, forcing him to retire. Coulthard took his second consecutive home victory, ahead of Häkkinen who completed the McLaren 1–2, with Schumacher third.

The win got Coulthard to second in the standings with 14 points, but 20 behind Michael Schumacher who had 34. Häkkinen had 12, and Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher had nine. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari had 43 points, while McLaren had 26.

=== Rounds 5 to 8 ===
Round five was in Spain, and Michael Schumacher took his first pole of the year ahead of Häkkinen, Barrichello and Coulthard (who was not 100% fit after a plane crash in France). Schumacher and Häkkinen stayed first and second after the start, but their teammates had lost out to Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher stalled during the second round of stops, and lost the lead to Häkkinen. After the stops, Michael Schumacher had a problem with his tyres, and was passed by Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. He then pitted, and rejoined fifth. Häkkinen took his first win of the season, with Coulthard making it a second successive McLaren 1–2, and Barrichello completed the podium. Michael Schumacher was fifth behind his brother.

The European Grand Prix, held at the Nurburgring in Germany was next. Coulthard took pole ahead of Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen and Barrichello. Coulthard did not have a great start and was quickly passed by Schumacher. Häkkinen, however, had a blinder and shot past both of them. And then the rain came, resulting in Schumacher passing Häkkinen on lap 11 at the chicane. Schumacher kept the lead, Coulthard passed Häkkinen, and Barrichello was down in ninth. Häkkinen passed Coulthard, who was struggling badly with a problem. There were no more changes at the front. Schumacher won from Häkkinen, Coulthard was third but was lapped, and Barrichello charged back up from ninth to fourth.

With over a third of the season complete, Michael Schumacher led the championship with 46 points, Häkkinen was second with 28, Coulthard was third with 24, and Barrichello was fourth with 16. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari had 62 points, McLaren had 52, and Williams were best of the rest with 15.

The glamorous Monaco Grand Prix was the seventh round, and Michael Schumacher eased to pole. Jordan found some pace, with Trulli getting second ahead of Coulthard, and Frentzen fourth ahead of Häkkinen. As the race started, the top drivers maintained their places, but in the midfield, Jenson Button tipped Pedro de la Rosa into a spin, blocking the track. The race had to be red-flagged. Out came the second start, and all the drivers started cleanly. The Jordans were not as quick as they were in qualifying, and Trulli was clearly holding up Coulthard, and the latter could do nothing about it. Schumacher shot out into the distance at a second a lap. Then, on lap 37, Trulli retired with a gearbox failure, releasing Coulthard. Coulthard closed in on Schumacher, but with a gap of 36 seconds, there was nothing much he could do until Schumacher suffered suspension failure on the 55th lap, forcing him to retire. Häkkinen was fifth until he slowed down with a problem. The team were able to fix it and send him back out again. Frentzen, who was running second punted his car into the wall with eight laps to go, in an attrition-filled race. Coulthard took the win, ahead of Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella, while Häkkinen mustered sixth place.

Now to North America for the Canadian GP. Michael Schumacher took pole ahead of Coulthard, Barrichello and Häkkinen. The top two kept their grid positions into the first corner, but Jacques Villeneuve was up to third ahead of Barrichello and Häkkinen. This allowed the top two to pull away. And then Coulthard was given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty because his mechanics worked on his car less than 15 seconds before the parade lap. He rejoined in the midfield. Barrichello passed Villeneuve on lap 25, but the gap to Schumacher was 27 seconds. Häkkinen took third from Villeneuve on lap 28, and the order settled down until it started raining. Everyone pitted for wets, and the order was shuffled completely. Schumacher stayed first, but Fischella had got ahead of Barrichello and Häkkinen, with Trulli fifth. A mistake from Fisichella allowed Barrichello through into second. Michael Schumacher took his fifth win of the season, with Barrichello making it a Ferrari 1–2 ahead of Fisichella. Häkkinen had to be content with fourth.

With nearly half the season over, Michael Schumacher had a 22-point lead in the standings, with 56 points to Coulthard&#x27;s 34. Häkkinen and Barrichello were not far behind, with 32 and 28 points respectively. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari had an 18-point lead over McLaren, with 84 points to the McLaren&#x27;s 66. Benetton were third with 18.

=== Rounds 9 to 12 ===
The French Grand Prix was next on the calendar. Michael Schumacher took his third consecutive pole, and again Coulthard was second, Barrichello third and Häkkinen fourth. When the race started, Schumacher kept first but Coulthard was beaten by Barrichello. Schumacher slowly started to pull away from his teammate and built a lead. Coulthard&#x27;s car handled better as the fuel load decreased, and on lap 22, he passed Barrichello. During the round of pitstops, Barrichello lost out to Häkkinen. Schumacher&#x27;s tyres were badly blistered, and so the McLarens and Barrichello started to close in on him. Coulthard tried to pass him at the outside of the Adelaide hairpin but Schumacher pushed him wide. Coulthard was not happy and made a series of irate gestures. A few laps later, Coulthard went for the inside at the same corner and made the move cleanly. Coulthard apologized for his gestures after the race. Schumacher kept second until 12 laps from the end when his engine blew up. Coulthard won, with Häkkinen making it a McLaren 1–2, and Barrichello completed the podium.

The A1-Ring in Austria was the host for Round ten. Häkkinen and Coulthard started 1–2, for the first time since Brazil, with the Ferraris of Barrichello and Schumacher in third and fourth respectively. The McLarens maintained their positions at the start, but there was carnage behind, with the Ferraris at the centre. Trulli hit the back of Barrichello, and at the same time, Ricardo Zonta hit Schumacher, tipping him to a spin. Schumacher spun in Trulli&#x27;s path, causing a collision between the two drivers that lead to their retirements from the race. During the mayhem that followed, Mika Salo emerged third and Pedro de la Rosa emerged fourth, with Barrichello down in ninth. The McLarens quickly disappeared into the distance, while de la Rosa took third from Salo. Barrichello charged back up to fourth, which became third when de la Rosa&#x27;s engine failed, putting him out from third. Häkkinen and Coulthard gave McLaren their fourth 1–2, with Barrichello finishing third. After the race, McLaren were penalized and lost 10 Constructors&#x27; Championship points because an FIA seal was found to be missing from Häkkinen&#x27;s car; Häkkinen did not lose any points.

With ten races out of 17 finished, Michael Schumacher led the championship with 56 points, whilst Coulthard was only 6 points behind with 50, and Häkkinen a further two points behind with 48. Barrichello was fourth with 36, and Fisichella was fifth with 18. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led by only 4 points now, with 92 compared to McLaren&#x27;s 88. Williams were third with 19.

Now to Germany, and Coulthard took his second pole ahead of Michael Schumacher, with Fisichella taking third from Häkkinen in a dry-wet qualifying. Häkkinen had one of his best ever starts, and shot up to first even before the first corner. Schumacher was hit from behind by Fisichella, and both were punted into the wall. This left Häkkinen and Coulthard running 1–2, with no one to challenge them. After 25 laps out of 44, the McLarens were half a minute ahead of third-placed Trulli. de la Rosa was fourth, ahead of Barrichello who was both recovering from a bad qualifying. And then, a disgruntled Mercedes-Benz employee ran to the track with a banner. The safety car was out, while the man was taken away. Everyone took the chance to pit, and Coulthard lost out badly because McLaren could not take both their cars at the same time. As the race restarted, it started raining. However, it rained only in some portion of the track. Everyone with the exception of Barrichello and Frentzen pitted. This left Barrichello leading ahead of Frentzen, Häkkinen, Trulli and Coulthard. Those on dries were lapping as quick as those on wets. Trulli was given a stop-go penalty for overtaking under yellow flags. Frentzen lost second when his gearbox failed. This left Barrichello to take his first ever win ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard.

The drivers went to Hungary for the next round, and Michael Schumacher took pole ahead of Coulthard, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello. Häkkinen again started like a rocket, and beat both Michael Schumacher and Coulthard into the first corner. Häkkinen pulled away, and Coulthard was held up by Schumacher. Coulthard would have got in front of Schumacher at the second round of stops, but lost time behind Gastón Mazzacane and then Marc Gené. This meant he emerged a fraction behind Schumacher. Häkkinen won, with Schumacher and Coulthard making up the podium. Barrichello beat Ralf to fourth. 

Häkkinen&#x27;s win had now given him the lead in the championship, with 64 points to Schumacher&#x27;s 62. Coulthard was third with 58, and Barrichello fourth with 49. Fisichella was fifth with 18. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren took the lead from Ferrari, a lead of 1 point, with 112 compared to Ferrari&#x27;s 111. Williams were third with 24.

=== Rounds 13 to 17 ===
Round 13 out of 17 was in Belgium. Häkkinen took pole, and much to his joy, Trulli and Button took second and third, pushing Michael Schumacher and Coulthard down to fourth and fifth. It was wet at the start, but the top 5 maintained their positions. Häkkinen immediately set about building up a lead. On lap five, Button tried to pass Trulli, and they collided. Trulli was out, and Button lost places. Schumacher and Coulthard gladly took second and third. The former now started to close in on Häkkinen, and took the lead when Häkkinen had a half-spin on lap 12. As the track dried out, everyone changed from wet to dry tyres. Coulthard stayed out too long, and dropped from third to ninth. On a dry track, Häkkinen was faster than Schumacher, and chased him down. With four laps to go, he made a move, but Schumacher turned at him and forced him to the grass at 200 mph. On the next lap, when they were coming to lap Ricardo Zonta, the two men took either sides, and when they turned, Häkkinen was ahead. Häkkinen went on to win and Schumacher had to be content with second. Ralf was third, and Coulthard bounced back to finish fourth.

The next round was in Italy, the home of Ferrari. Their drivers did not disappoint, Schumacher and Barrichello giving them their first 1–2 start of the season, ahead of Häkkinen, Villeneuve and Coulthard. At the start, Schumacher and the McLarens started well, but Barrichello and Villeneuve started badly. Schumacher and Häkkinen were first and second, with Coulthard third. Into the second chicane, and Frentzen just braked too late, and hit the back of Barrichello and Trulli, who were running side by side. All three spun, and Coulthard too was collected in the confusion. Later, it came out that a fire marshal, Paolo Ghislimberti had been killed after he was hit on the chest by a wheel from this collision. The top three at the end of this carnage were: Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher. The race restarted after 10 laps behind the safety car, and Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen quickly pulled away from the rest. Häkkinen tried to outpace Schumacher, but he was just not as quick as the latter. Michael Schumacher took his sixth win of the year, ahead of Häkkinen and Ralf. After the race, Schumacher burst into tears in the press conference, when told that he had equalled Ayrton Senna&#x27;s record of 41 wins, and about Ghislimberti&#x27;s death.

With three more races to go, Häkkinen still led Michael Schumacher by two points, with 80 compared to the latter&#x27;s 78. Coulthard was all but out of it, and was third with 61. Barrichello was fourth with 49, Ralf was fifth with 20, and Fisichella sixth with 18. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren had 131 points, and a lead of four points over Ferrari who had 127. Williams was third with 30.

The United States Grand Prix hosted the 15th round, and Michael Schumacher took his seventh pole of the season. Coulthard was second, with Häkkinen and Barrichello third and fourth. Before the race, it rained, and so everyone started on wet tyres. The red lights stayed longer than usual for the start, and Coulthard took off a little too early. This gave him the lead, but it was clear that he would suffer a penalty. He led, ahead of Schumacher and Häkkinen. He knew he would have to suffer a penalty, and blocked Schumacher so that his teammate could close in. Schumacher was having none of it, and passed Coulthard on lap 7 at the first corner. The track began to dry out, and Häkkinen pitted for dries. He came out behind Gastón Mazzacane, and was stuck there. Coulthard soon had his penalty and dropped out of contention. The Ferraris stayed out late, and while Schumacher was ten seconds in the lead, Barrichello rejoined in the mid-field. The top three after the change for dries were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen and Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen set a string of fastest laps, and closed down a ten-second gap to Michael Schumacher to four in ten laps, only for his engine to blow up on lap 25. Michael Schumacher was left with a big lead ahead of his brother, which became even bigger when Ralf&#x27;s engine failed with 12 laps to go, giving second to Frentzen. Frentzen, however was soon passed by a charging Barrichello. Schumacher had a spin towards the end, but hit nothing and survived. He went on to win, with Barrichello making it a Ferrari 1–2, and Frentzen completed the podium.

This win, coupled with Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement gave Schumacher an eight-point lead, meaning that a win in the next race would give him the title. The result also gave Ferrari the lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

The penultimate round was in Japan, and Michael Schumacher beat Häkkinen to pole by 0.009 seconds. Coulthard was third and Barrichello fourth. The race started in overcast conditions, with rain looming. Häkkinen started off better than Schumacher and took the lead. Coulthard maintained third. The two title contenders, Häkkinen and Schumacher pulled away from the others at over a second a lap and were separated by 2–3 seconds. The first round of stops changed nothing. Then, some rain started spitting down at the track, and Schumacher started to close in. Schumacher&#x27;s second pitstop was three laps after Häkkinen&#x27;s, and although he was two seconds behind Häkkinen before the stops, he came out four seconds ahead. Schumacher won the race, and the championship, with Häkkinen and Coulthard completing the podium. Barrichello finished fourth.

The final round of the season was in Malaysia. Michael Schumacher took pole again, ahead of Häkkinen, Coulthard and a flu-ridden Barrichello. Schumacher had a poor start from pole, and immediately both McLarens were ahead of him. However, it became clear that Häkkinen had jumped the start and he received a penalty. He let Coulthard through, and held up the Ferraris until he went in for the penalty. Coulthard had a good lead, but wasted it by running wide at Turn three. He pitted before Michael Schumacher, and the time he lost by the mistake gave the lead to Schumacher. The two ran together for the rest of the race, with Barrichello unable to keep up. Michael Schumacher won again, ahead of Coulthard and Barrichello, and this ensured the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Ferrari. Häkkinen charged back to finish fourth.

At the end of the season, Michael Schumacher was champion with 108 points, Häkkinen was second with 89, Coulthard third with 73, Barrichello fourth with 62, Ralf Schumacher fifth with 24, and Fisichella sixth with 18. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari won with 170 points, McLaren was second with 152, and Williams was third with 36.

<doc id="1132602" wikidata="Q1529437" url="?curid=1132602" title="Tactical role-playing game">
<text>Tactical role-playing game (abbreviated TRPG), also known as strategy role-playing game or (both abbreviated SRPG), is a video game genre that combines core elements of role-playing video games with those of tactical (turn-based or real-time) strategy video games. The formats of tactical RPGs are much like traditional tabletop role-playing games and strategy games in appearance, pacing, and rule structure. Likewise, early tabletop role-playing games are descended from skirmish wargames such as &quot;Chainmail&quot;, which were primarily concerned with combat.

==Game design==

This subgenre of role-playing video games principally refers to games which incorporate elements from strategy video games as an alternative to traditional role-playing game (RPG) systems. Like standard RPGs, the player typically controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies. Like other RPGs, death is usually temporary, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. Unlike traditional RPGs which are traditionally single-player, some tactical RPGs feature multiplayer play, such as &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;.

A distinct difference between tactical RPGs and traditional RPGs is the lack of exploration; for instance, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; does away with the third-person exploration of towns and dungeons that is typical in a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. Instead of exploration, there is an emphasis on battle strategy. Players are able to build and train characters to use in battle, utilizing different classes, including warriors and magic users, depending on the game. Characters normally gain experience points from battle and grow stronger, and are awarded secondary experience points which can be used to advance in specific character classes. Battles have specific winning conditions, such as defeating all enemies or surviving a certain number of turns, that the player must accomplish before the next map will become available. In between battles, players can access their characters to equip them, change classes, train them, depending on the game.

==History==

A number of early role-playing video games used a tactical form of combat, such as &quot;Tunnels of Doom&quot; (1982) and &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot; (1983), as well as &quot;The Dragon and Princess&quot; (1982) and &quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot; (1983), which introduced party-based, tiled combat to America and Japan, respectively. Further, tactical RPGs are descendants of tabletop role-playing games and wargames, such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Chainmail&quot;, which were mainly tactical in their original form. Nevertheless, much of the development of tactical RPGs has diverged on each side of the Pacific, and the term &quot;tactical RPG&quot; is sometimes reserved only for those titles that were created in Japan.

===8-bit origins in Japan (1982–1990)===
One of the earliest Japanese RPGs, Koei&#x27;s &quot;The Dragon and Princess&quot;, was released on NEC&#x27;s PC-8001 home computer platform in 1982. This game can also be considered a precursor to the tactical RPG genre. It used a combat system where, following a random encounter, the game transitioned to a separate, graphical, overhead battle screen, and tactical turn-based combat ensued. That same year, &quot;Tunnels of Doom&quot; used a similar combat system, as did &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot; released in 1983.

During the 8-bit era, &quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot;, a computer game developed by Koji Sumii for the Sharp X1 in 1983 and ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by ASCII in 1985, was responsible for laying the foundations for the tactical RPG genre, or &quot;simulation RPG&quot; genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of role-playing and strategy game elements. The game revolves around a king who must recruit soldiers and lead his army against overwhelming enemy forces, while each unit gains experience and levels up along the way. It is also considered to be an early prototype real-time strategy game.

Another notable early example of the genre was Kure Software Koubou&#x27;s 1988 PC-8801 strategy RPG, &quot;Silver Ghost&quot;, which was cited by Camelot Software Planning&#x27;s Hiroyuki Takahashi as inspiration for the &quot;Shining&quot; series of tactical RPGs. According to Takahashi, &quot;Silver Ghost&quot; was a simulation action type of game where the players had to direct, oversee and command multiple characters. Unlike later tactical RPGs, however, &quot;Silver Ghost&quot; was not turn-based, but instead used real-time strategy and action role-playing game elements. It also featured a point-and-click interface, to control the characters using a cursor. A similar game released by Kure Software Koubo that same year was &quot;First Queen&quot;, a unique hybrid between a real-time strategy, action RPG, and strategy RPG. Like an RPG, the player can explore the world, purchase items, and level up, and like a strategy video game, it focuses on recruiting soldiers and fighting against large armies rather than small parties. The game&#x27;s &quot;Gochyakyara&quot; (&quot;Multiple Characters&quot;) system let the player control one character at a time while the others are controlled by computer AI that follow the leader, and where battles are large-scale with characters sometimes filling an entire screen. &quot;Master of Monsters&quot;, developed by SystemSoft and released in 1989 for the MSX2, added fantasy characters and magic attacks to the gameplay of the wartime combat &quot;Daisenryaku&quot; series, which had instead opted for tanks, planes, and other vehicles of real-world modern combat. &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; also added experience bars for the character units, a concept which would be adapted and popularized by later console-based series like &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. Unlike many other early titles in the genre, &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; made its way to the west via a port to the Sega Genesis in 1991, albeit only in North America.

However, the genre did not become prolific until Nintendo published the game that set the template for tactical wargame RPGs, &quot;Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi&quot;. Developed by Intelligent Systems and released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom in 1990, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; would become an archetype for the whole genre, establishing gameplay elements that are still used in tactical RPGs today, though many of these elements were influenced by earlier RPGs and strategy games. Combining the basic concepts from games like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and simple turn-based strategy elements that the development team gained experience with in their 1988 release &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;, Intelligent Systems created a hit, which spawned many sequels and imitators. It introduced unique features such as how the characters were not interchangeable pawns but each of them were unique, in terms of both class and stats, and how a character who runs out of hit points would usually remain dead forever. The latter mechanic was used to introduce a non-linear storyline to the genre, where different multiple endings are possible depending on which characters are alive or dead, a concept still used in recent games such as &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor&quot;, and &quot;Final Promise Story&quot;. It was not until the release of &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, many years later, that the series was introduced to Western gamers, who until then were more familiar with localized precursors like &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot;, as well as later tactical RPGs partially influenced by &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, including the &quot;Shining&quot; and &quot;Ogre&quot; series and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, and Nippon Ichi games like &quot;Disgaea&quot;.

===Eastern console history (1991–present)===
====16-bit consoles====
During the 16-bit generation, among the first imitators was &quot;Langrisser&quot; by NCS/Masaya, first released for the Mega Drive / Genesis in 1991. It was translated for North American release and retitled &quot;Warsong&quot;. The &quot;Langrisser&quot; series differed from &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; in that it used a general-soldier structure instead of controlling main characters. &quot;Langrisser&quot;, too, spawned many sequels, none of which were brought to North America. &quot;Langrisser&quot; set itself apart from other tactical RPGs in its time with larger-scale battles, where the player could control over thirty units at one time and fight against scores of enemies. Since &quot;Der Langrisser&quot; in 1994, the series offered non-linear branching paths and multiple endings. The player&#x27;s choices and actions affected which of four different paths they followed, either aligning themselves with one of three different factions or fighting against all of them. Each of the four paths leads to a different ending and there are over 75 possible scenarios. &quot;Langrisser III&quot; introduced a relationship system similar to dating sims. Depending on the player&#x27;s choices and actions, the feelings of the female allies will change towards the player character, who will end up with the female ally he is closest with.

&quot;Master of Monsters&quot; was a unique title by SystemSoft. Where &quot;Langrisser&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; used a square-based grid, &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; used a hexagonal grid. Players could choose one of four different Lords to defend their Towers and areas on the grid by building an army of creatures to destroy the opposing armies. This game had a sequel for the PlayStation called &quot;Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia&quot;, which had limited success and was criticized for its slow gameplay. Both &quot;Warsong&quot; and &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; were cited as the inspirations behind the 2005 turn-based strategy computer RPG, &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot;.

The first game in the long-running &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series is another early example of the genre, initially released for the Game Boy in 1991.

Another influential early tactical RPG was Sega&#x27;s &quot;Shining Force&quot; for the Sega Genesis, which was released in 1992. &quot;Shining Force&quot; used even more console RPG elements than earlier games, allowing the player to walk around towns and talk to people and buy weapons. It spawned sequels, &quot;Shining Force II&quot; for Sega Genesis and &quot;Shining Force CD&quot; for Sega CD, besides the &quot;Shining Force Gaiden 1, 2 and 3&quot; for Sega Game Gear and &quot;Shining Force III&quot; for Sega Saturn. The game&#x27;s creator, Camelot Software Planning&#x27;s Hiroyuki Takahashi, cited Kure Software Koubou&#x27;s 1988 tactical RPG, &quot;Silver Ghost&quot;, as his inspiration. One game released solely in Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot;, began Square&#x27;s (now Square Enix) famous line of tactical RPGs.

Four games from the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; series have been released in North America. The first was &quot;Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen&quot; was released for the SNES in 1993 and was more of a real-time strategy RPG in which the player forms character parties that are moved around a map in real-time. When two parties meet, the combat plays out with minimal user interaction. The game is notable for introducing a moral alignment system that not only affects the gameplay but where tactical and strategic decisions influence the outcome of a non-linear branching storyline, which is affected by factors such as the moral alignments of the troops used to liberate a city, whether to keep certain liberated cities guarded, making popular or unpopular decisions, concentrating power among just a few units, making deals with thieves, and a general sense of justice. These factors lead to one of 13 possible endings, alongside other factors such as how many and which units are used, how battles are fought, the army&#x27;s reputation, player character&#x27;s alignment and charisma, and secrets discovered.

The sequel, &quot;Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together&quot;, was originally a 1995 SNES game that was not released outside Japan. It was later ported to the PlayStation, along with &quot;Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen&quot;. Both of the PlayStation re-releases were marketed in North America by Atlus, as was &quot;Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber&quot; for the Nintendo 64. &quot;Tactics Ogre&#x27;s&quot; gameplay is more similar to the genre of tactical RPGs that &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; belongs to (which was developed by former members of Quest and created/written/directed by Yasumi Matsuno), complete with battles taking place on isometric grids. It was also the first to bear the name &quot;Tactics&quot; in the title, a term gamers would come to associate with the genre. Not only are characters moved individually on a grid, but the view is isometric, and the order of combat is calculated for each character individually. The game also expanded the non-linear alignment system of its predecessor, with three types of alignments for each unit: Lawful, Neutral, and Chaos, neither of which are portrayed as necessarily good or bad. The game gives players the freedom to choose their own destiny, with difficult moral decisions, such as whether to follow a Lawful path by upholding the oath of loyalty and slaughter civilian non-player characters on the leader&#x27;s command, or follow the chaotic path by following a personal sense of justice and rebelling, or instead follow a more neutral path. Such factors affect the game&#x27;s ending, which is also affected by decisions such as whether to obtain the most powerful class, which can only be acquired by making a tragic sacrifice. Another feature was &quot;Warren&#x27;s Report&quot;, a type of database on the land, people, encounters and races of Valeria (similar to, but much more expansive than, the troves of knowledge in &quot;Mass Effect&quot;). Although this game defined the genre in many ways, it was not widely recognized by American gamers because it was released to American audiences several years later. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; shared some staff members with &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; and shares many of its gameplay elements. A prequel to the original &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, &quot;Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis&quot;, was later released for the Game Boy Advance. A remake of &quot;Let Us Cling Together&quot; was later released for the PSP in 2011.

In 1996, the tactical role-playing game &quot;Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; also featured a non-linear branching storyline, but instead of using an alignment system, it used a relationship system resembling dating sims that gave players the ability to affect the relationship points between different units/characters. This in turn affected both the gameplay and storyline, with the different possible relationships in the first generation of the game&#x27;s plot leading to different units/characters appearing during the second generation, ultimately leading to different possible outcomes to the storyline.

====32-bit consoles====
The 32-bit era saw many influential tactical RPGs, such as Konami&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Vandal Hearts series&quot;, which feature branching storylines that can be altered by the player&#x27;s dialogue choices that lead to different endings, as well as Sega&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Shining Force 3&quot;, SCEI&#x27;s &quot;Arc the Lad Collection&quot; (1996–1999), and Square&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and 1999 &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;. Konami&#x27;s &quot;Vandal Hearts&quot; was an early PlayStation title that helped popularize tactical RPGs in the US. It was released by Konami and featured a 3D isometric map that could be rotated by the player. A sequel was subsequently released, also for the PlayStation.

One of the first 32-bit tactical RPGs, &quot;Guardian War&quot;, was developed by Micro Cabin and released in 1993 on the Panasonic 3DO. While the game lacked in story, it included many game mechanics that are seen throughout many of the 32-bit tactical RPGs; like isometric camera rotation, interchangeable and hybridization of &quot;jobs&quot; or &quot;classes&quot; for each character, the combination of moves between characters, and the capture of NPCs and having them play on your side.

Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, combined tactical RPG combat with dating sim and visual novel elements, introducing a real-time branching choice system where, during an event or conversation, the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit, or not to respond at all within that time. The player&#x27;s choice, or lack thereof, affects the player character&#x27;s relationship with other characters and in turn the characters&#x27; performance in battle, the direction of the storyline, and the ending. Later games in the series added several variations, including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation, and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation. The success of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; led to a wave of games that combine the RPG and dating sim genres, including &quot;Thousand Arms&quot; in 1998, &quot;&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Luminous Arc&quot; in 2007.

&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; was arguably the most responsible for bringing tactical RPGs to North America. Developed by former employees of Quest, the developer responsible for the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; series, it combined many elements of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series with &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;-style gameplay. It also expanded on the isometric grid combat of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; by allowing players to freely rotate the camera around the battlefield rather than keeping the camera in a fixed position. The storyline of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; was also more linear than its predecessor, in order to provide a deeper epic narrative. Thanks to Hiroyuki Ito, lead designer on the game, it also successfully implemented a modified job system, previously used in &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, which allowed the player to change a unit&#x27;s character class at any time during the game and learn new abilities from job points earned with each class. The game was acclaimed for both its highly tactical gameplay and its well-written storyline that touches on issues such as class, privilege, religion, and politics. The game&#x27;s reputation led to other developers adding the word &quot;Tactics&quot; to their titles to indicate the tactical RPG genre. It was later ported to the PSP as &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions&quot; and is still regarded as one of the greatest tactical RPGs of all time.

====Sixth generation====
On sixth-generation consoles, a loyal American fan-base has been established by Nippon Ichi, makers of the PlayStation 2 games &quot;La Pucelle: Tactics&quot;, &quot;Phantom Brave&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Of these games, &quot;Disgaea&quot; has been the most successful to date, and was the second Nippon Ichi game released in North America, the first being &quot;&quot; (published by Atlus). Throughout this generation, companies have recognized the large audience and popularity of these types of games, particularly Atlus and Nintendo. &quot;La Pucelle: Tactics&quot; and &quot;Disgaea: Hour of Darkness&quot;, which Atlus re-released due to high demand, have become cult hits for the PlayStation 2.

In 2001, &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot; for the Dreamcast introduced a new combat system that incorporates action elements, and abandons the use of grids in favour of allowing each character to move around freely across the battlefield but with a limited number of moves each turn illustrated using a bar at the bottom of the screen. This type of combat system would later be the basis for the combat system in &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;, developed by much of the same team in 2008. The &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series would not be released in the West until the fifth game, &quot;Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love&quot; (2005). The &quot;Front Mission&quot; series also continued on to the PlayStation 2, with &quot;Front Mission 4&quot; and &quot;5&quot;, the latter of which never saw a Western release, but a fan translation.

The Game Boy Advance would also see the release of &quot;&quot; (2005) by &quot;X-COM&quot; creators, Nick and Julian Gollop. The game would be highly praised for adapting the combat mechanics of the highly detailed and acclaimed PC strategy series, but would also receive criticism for sub-par presentation, a lackluster storyline, and lack of link-mode support. The game ended up receiving an average score of 77.83% at GameRankings. In early 2006, Idea Factory&#x27;s &quot;Blazing Souls&quot; featured nonlinear gameplay that allows the player to progress through the game and the story in whatever order they wish. In addition, instead of having separate screens or maps for exploration and battle, the game features a seamless transition between exploration and battle. This time period also saw the Western debut of &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; in &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot; (simply titled &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; outside Japan).

====Seventh generation====
On seventh-generation consoles, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot; (2008) for the PlayStation 3 utilizes the seventh-generation console processing power by using a distinctive anime/watercolor art style, as well as incorporating third-person tactical shooter elements. After selecting a character in the overhead map view, the player manually controls him/her from a third-person view. This mechanic allows for, among others: free movement to a certain range, manual aiming with extra damage for headshots, a limited cover system, and real-time hazards, such as interception fire and landmines. The game has been described as &quot;the missing link between &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot;&quot;.

In 2004, Konami released &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot;, which combined the stealth game elements of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series with turn-based tactical RPG gameplay of games like &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, and &quot;Disgaea&quot;, along with the random-draw, forethought and resource management appeal of card battles like in Konami&#x27;s own &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; games (1999 onwards). Developer Kuju Entertainment released &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics&quot; for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. The game intended to adapt the rules and mechanics of the popular table-top role-playing game, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but suffered from a poor interface and awkward camera controls.

The Atlus title &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor&quot; (2009) blended together both traditional and tactical RPG gameplay along with non-linear adventure game elements. It also featured an innovative demon auction system and a death clock system where each character has a specified time of death, with the player&#x27;s actions and choices having consequences on who lives and dies. &quot;Infinite Space&quot; (2009) by PlatinumGames, for the Nintendo DS, is a hybrid of tactical role-playing, real-time strategy and space simulator elements, and features a non-linear branching narrative with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences, and an epic scale spanning hundreds of planets.

&quot;Radiant Historia&quot;, released by Atlus for the Nintendo DS in 2010, combined the gameplay of traditional RPG titles with a highly tactical grid combat system, with several unique features such as a queue allowing party members to switch turns and perform combo attacks when near each other on the queue, and the manipulation of enemy positions by knocking a target onto another grid space and attack multiple targets when enemies fall onto the same grid space. The game is most notable for its unique take on the concept of non-linear branching storylines, which it combines with the concepts of time travel and parallel universes, expanding on the &quot;Chrono&quot; series. &quot;Radiant Historia&quot; takes it much further by giving players the freedom to travel backwards and forwards through a timeline to alter the course of history, with each of their choices and actions having a major effect on the timeline. The player can return to certain points in history and live through certain events again to make different choices and see different possible outcomes on the timeline. The player can also travel back and forth between two parallel timelines, and can obtain many possible parallel endings. Square Enix&#x27;s PSP version of &quot;Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together&quot;, released around the same time, featured a similar &quot;World&quot; system that allows players to revisit key plot points and make different choices to see how the story unfolds differently.

Atlus title &quot;Growlanser IV: Wayfarer of the Time&quot; (2012) features a unique battle system that blends turn-based and real-time strategy. The player controls each character in turn, but the actions play out in real-time. Imageepoch&#x27;s title &quot;Saigo no Yakusoku no Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Final Promise Story&quot;) for the PlayStation Portable has a strategic command-based battle system where enemies learn from previous skirmishes. The characters can also die permanently during gameplay which in turn affects the game&#x27;s storyline.

===Western personal computers===
Many Western PC games have utilized this genre for years, as well. Western games tend to have stronger military themes, without many of the fantasy elements often found in their console (and mainly Japanese) counterparts, as well as greater freedom of movement when interacting with the surrounding environment. Notable examples include the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series (1994-2018) and the &quot;Silent Storm&quot; series (2003-2005), with many titles owing considerably to the &quot;X-COM&quot; series (1994-2016) of strategy games. In fact, Western PC games in the genre were largely defined by &quot;X-COM&quot; in much the same way as Eastern console games were by &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;.

====1990s====
&quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; (1990) came about when Julian Gollop wanted to add more role-playing elements to his 1985 video game &quot;&quot;, which was more of a tactical wargame. &quot;&quot; (1997), part of the &quot;Battle Isle&quot; series, was one of the first strategy titles to use fully 3D graphics and support hardware acceleration on the 3dfx Voodoo. Other titles in the series are mainly tactical wargames featuring vehicle combat and base capturing. The game was generally well received by critics.

&quot;Gorky 17&quot; (1999, a.k.a. &quot;Odium&quot;) is a tactical RPG by Polish developer Metropolis Software featuring elements of survival horror. It is also the first title in a series featuring the main character, Cole Sullivan. Later titles in the series were third-person shooters. The game&#x27;s reception was mixed.

&quot;Vantage Master&quot; is a series of tactical RPGs similar to &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows, beginning in 1997. The first game in the series was never released outside Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The latest game, &quot;Vantage Master Portable&quot; for the PSP, was released on April 24, 2008.

&quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; is a tactical turn-based RPG series developed by &quot;Sir-Tech Canada&quot; released in 1995, with a sequel released in 1999. A third game in the series, developed by Haemimont Games and published by THQ Nordic, was released in 2023.

====2000s====
&quot;Shadow Watch&quot; (2000) is a video game adaptation of the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Power Plays&quot; novel of the same name developed by Red Storm Entertainment. It has also been compared to &quot;X-COM&quot;, though it features a different action point system and is missing the latter game&#x27;s upgradable units. The game&#x27;s reception was mixed.

&quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; (2001) is a spin-off of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series of CRPGs by Interplay Entertainment developed by Australian company Micro Forté. Unusual for the genre is the option to choose between real-time and turn-based play, or between &quot;Continuous Turn-Based Mode&quot; (CTB), &quot;Individual Turn-Based Mode&quot; (ITB), and &quot;Squad Turn-Based Mode&quot; (STB) modes as the developers put it. The game even allows the player to switch modes in the middle of play. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, though was not as well-received as the series&#x27; more traditional RPG titles.

&quot;Soldiers of Anarchy&quot; (2002) is a squad-based real-time tactics computer game by German developer Silver Style Entertainment. Gameplay involves squad tactics, vehicles and a wide variety of weapons and ammunition. The game received mixed reviews from critics.

&quot;Freedom Force&quot; (2002) and its sequel, &quot;Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich&quot; (2005) - both by Irrational Games - are two examples of comic book superhero tactical RPGs that are played in real-time instead of turns. Both games received favorable reviews from critics.

&quot;Paradise Cracked&quot; (2003), &quot;COPS 2170: The Power of Law&quot; (2005), &quot;Metalheart: Replicants Rampage&quot; (2004) and &quot;Shadow Vault&quot; (2004) are poorly received tactical RPGs by MiST Land South, Akella and Mayhem Studios of Russia and Slovakia, respectively. &quot;Paradise Cracked&quot; was inspired by cyberpunk works such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, and Philip K. Dick novels; and &quot;Metalheart: Replicants Rampage&quot; is a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk tactical RPG inspired by &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;, &quot;Syndicate&quot;, and &quot;Fallout&quot;. &quot;COPS 2170: The Power of Law&quot; is set in the same &quot;Reality 4.13&quot; universe that first appeared in &quot;Paradise Cracked&quot;.

&quot;Hammer &amp; Sickle&quot; (2005) is a tactical RPG co-developed by Russian companies Novik &amp; Co and Nival Interactive, and published by CDV. It is set in the &quot;Silent Storm&quot; universe and follows the events in the main series. After this came &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2006) and its sequel, &quot;Day Watch&quot; (2007), also by Nival Interactive, but instead based on the Russian novels and films of the same name. All three games received mediocre-to-poor review scores despite utilizing the highly regarded &quot;Silent Storm&quot; engine.

Other titles inspired by &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; include &quot;Brigade E5: New Jagged Union&quot; (2006) and its sequel, simply titled &quot;7.62&quot; (2007), by Russian developer Apeiron; &quot;Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge&quot; (2007) by GFI Russia; and &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot; by bitComposer Games. The &quot;Brigade E5&quot; series incorporates an innovative hybrid real-time system the company calls &quot;Smart Pause Mode&quot; in an attempt to heighten realism; &quot;Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge&quot; began its life as &quot;Jagged Alliance 3D&quot; before Strategy First withdrew the rights to the series name; &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot; is a 3D, real-time remake of &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;. Lastly, &quot;Jagged Alliance: Flashback&quot; was released in 2014 following a successful Kickstarter. The developer Full Control gained notoriety, however, for feuding with its backers, and the company stopped making games shortly thereafter.

Additional titles inspired by &quot;X-COM&quot; include &quot;&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2007) and &quot;&quot; (2007) by Czech developers ALTAR Interactive and Chaos Concept; as well as &quot;Xenonauts&quot; (2014) by Goldhawk Interactive. ALTAR&#x27;s &quot;UFO&quot; series features real-time play; Chaos Concept&#x27;s &quot;UFO: Extraterrestrials&quot; received only mixed reviews; and &quot;Xenonauts&quot; currently has a &quot;Very Positive&quot; rating on Steam. The open source, cross-platform &quot;X-COM&quot;-clone &quot;&quot; is also under development.

&quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; (2005) is another &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; and &quot;Warsong&quot; clone, released under an open source license for multiple platforms. It is also continually updated.

====2010s====

The tactical isometric cyberpunk/fantasy RPG, &quot;Shadowrun Returns&quot; (2013), was funded via a successful crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign that raised a total of $1.9 million for development. The game is based on the popular &quot;Shadowrun&quot; pen-and-paper setting by Jordan Weisman, and features tactical combat in a world filled with cybernetics, magic and fantasy creatures. Two sequels, &quot;&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2015) quickly followed. An online tactical game not directly related to the previous three games, &quot;Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown&quot;, was released to less-than-positive reviews in 2015.

In 2014 the tactical RPG &quot;Blackguards&quot; based on the German &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; pen-and-paper setting was released to mixed or average reviews. A sequel, &quot;Blackguards 2&quot;, was released one year later. In 2014, &quot;The Banner Saga&quot; was released, the first chapter of a TRPG trilogy that would lead to two sequels.

2015 saw the release of &quot;Invisible, Inc.&quot; for OS X, Windows and Linux. It has been described as a &quot;tactical RPG that mixes stealth with procedural generation&quot;, since it introduces elements of espionage and roguelike gameplay. It received generally favorable scores from reviewers. A version for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch has been released.

In March 2017 the German indie developer Overhype Studios released its tactical RPG &quot;Battle Brothers&quot; out of Early Access to generally favorable reviews. This mercenary company simulation was described as a &quot;cleverly constructed, carefully balanced board game&quot;.

===Genre blurring===
Other games combine similar mechanics, but typically belong in other genres. Tactical wargames such as the &quot;Steel Panthers&quot; series (1995–2006) sometimes combine tactical military combat with RPG-derived unit advancement. &quot;Avalon Hill&#x27;s Squad Leader&quot; (2000), a man-to-man wargame utilizing the &quot;Soldiers at War&quot; engine, has also been compared (unfavorably) to &quot;X-COM&quot; and &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;. &quot;Rebelstar&quot; (1984) and &quot;Laser Squad&quot; (1988) were precursors to &quot;X-COM&quot; created by the same developer, Julian Gollop. They did not, however, feature the statistical character development and strategic map of the later series.

&quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot; (1983), a game regarded as the progenitor of the strategy/simulation RPG genre, is also difficult to clearly define. While often referred to as a strategy/simulation RPG, it is also sometimes referred to as a prototype real-time strategy, an early reverse tower defense game, and an early action role-playing game. &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; (1983) and later Koei titles as well as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; (1989) have blurred the line between a role-playing game, turn-based grand strategy wargame, and simulation video game. Similarly, Kure Software Koubou&#x27;s &quot;Silver Ghost&quot; (1988) combined elements of both tactical RPGs and action RPGs, while &quot;Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen&quot; (1993) blurred the line between a tactical RPG and a real-time strategy. &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; (2004) blurs the line between a stealth game, a genre the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series is normally known for, along with tactical role-playing inspired by the likes of &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, infused with card gameplay found in games like Konami&#x27;s own &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; series.

In addition to a turn-based tactical combat layer, the &quot;X-COM&quot; series also possesses a real-time 3D strategic layer, complete with global defensive map as well as a technology tree that the player must research in order to unlock new weapons and armor. &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; features a country sector map with fortified towns and roving bands of enemies that must be defeated before entering the capital city of Meduna. &quot;Knights in the Nightmare&quot; (2009) combines elements of traditional tactical RPGs with bullet hell–style shoot &#x27;em up gameplay.

Sega&#x27;s &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot; (2008) blurs the line even further by incorporating tactical RPG gameplay with both real-time strategy and third-person tactical shooter elements, including over-the-shoulder manual aiming and a cover system. This has led to the game being described by one source as &quot;the missing link between &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot;&quot;. In an interview with Eurogamer, &quot;X-COM&quot; developer Julian Gollop mentioned how surprised he was how close &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot; was in design to his cancelled game &quot;Dreamland Chronicles&quot;.

&quot;Infinite Space&quot; (2009) by PlatinumGames is a hybrid of tactical RPG, real-time strategy, and space simulator. &quot;The 3rd Birthday&quot; (2010), the third game in the &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; series, features a unique blend of action role-playing game, real-time tactical RPG, survival horror and third-person tactical shooter elements.

&quot;Dead State&quot; (2014) is a turn-based RPG developed by DoubleBear Productions and Iron Tower Studios set in a zombie apocalypse scenario. Players are tasked with leading a group of survivors living in a shelter in the fictional town of Splendid, Texas. &quot;Dead State&quot; mixes tactical combat and RPG character development with survival horror and base management elements. An &quot;enhanced edition&quot; was released in 2015 under the name, &quot;Dead State: Reanimated&quot;.

====Full-fledged CRPGs====
A number of &quot;full-fledged&quot; computer role-playing games could also be described as having &quot;tactical combat&quot;. Examples from the classic era of CRPGs include parts of the aforementioned &quot;Ultima&quot; series beginning with &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot; (1983); SSI&#x27;s &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Eternal Dagger&quot; (1987); the &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; (1992-1996) series based on the German &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; pen-and-paper system; and the &quot;Gold Box&quot; games of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s - many of which were later ported to Japanese video game systems. Other examples include Troika Games&#x27; &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; (2003), which features a highly accurate implementation of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition ruleset; &quot;Knights of the Chalice&quot; (2009), which implements the d20 Open Game License; and &quot;Pyrrhic Tales: Prelude to Darkness&quot; (2002), an open world RPG featuring one continuous game world. More recent examples include &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Age of Decadence&quot; (2015). Partly due to the success of &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, &quot;Divinity: Original Sin&quot;, &quot;Shadowrun: Dragonfall&quot;, &quot;Blackguards&quot; and &quot;Dead State&quot;, 2014 has been labeled &quot;the first year of the CRPG renaissance&quot;.

&quot;Tir-nan-óg&quot; (beginning in 1984) is a series of role-playing video games that premiered in Japan on the PC98 and later released for Windows. The latest title in the series is also being released for the PlayStation 2 and PSP. &quot;Heroes of Jin Yong&quot; (1996), a Chinese role-playing game based on the popular historical Wuxia novels by Jin Yong, features a number of melee and ranged kung fu skills to train and develop, as well as a grid-based battle system. A remake of the game under the title of &quot;Tale of Wuxia&quot; was released in Chinese in 2015, and later on Steam in both Chinese and English in 2016.

====Massively multiplayer online gaming====
Several massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) have combined multiplayer online gaming with tactical turn-based combat. Examples include, &quot;Dofus&quot; (2005), &quot;The Continuum&quot; (2008), as well as the Russian game &quot;Total Influence Online&quot; (2009). &quot;Tactica Online&quot; was a planned MMORPG that would have featured tactical combat, had development not been cancelled in 2006. &quot;Gunrox&quot; (2008), &quot;Poxnora&quot; (2006) and &quot;Wakfu&quot; (2012) are some other recent examples.

==Popularity==
Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time-consuming and extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player. Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed the same degree of success in North America and elsewhere. However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially in the West since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Suikoden Tactics&quot;, &quot;Vanguard Bandits&quot; and &quot;Disgaea&quot; enjoying a surprising measure of popularity outside Japan. Further, older Japanese tactical RPGs were also re-released via software emulation, such as Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console for the Wii, WiiU and Nintendo 3DS, until it was later replaced with the Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s legacy games service in 2018 before being fully discontinued in 2023, giving these games a new lease on life.

In the 2000s, some developers complained it was becoming increasingly difficult to develop games of this type (though several had been developed in Eastern Europe with limited success); and even some developers were beginning to complain about a supposed bias against turn-based systems. Reasons cited include publishers&#x27; focus on developing real-time, action-oriented games, as well as a perception that games with turn-based mechanics were &quot;too niche&quot; to become successful. Things have turned around in the 2010s, at least in the West. A few high-profile titles, such as 2K Games&#x27; strategy video games, &quot;&quot; and &quot;XCOM 2&quot; - as well as a number of Kickstarter-funded RPGs, such as Larian&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, inXile&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; and Harebrained Schemes&#x27; &quot;Shadowrun Returns&quot; - were successfully developed and published in recent years, in part due to new means of funding and distributing them. According to Dan Tudge of n-Space: &quot;The resurgence of tactical-isometric RPGs has a lot to do with accessibility. ... Changes in the ecosystem like Steam and digital distribution have made it easier than ever for developers to connect with players&quot;.

<text>Landsberg Prison is a prison in the town of Landsberg am Lech in the southwest of the German state of Bavaria, about west-southwest of Munich and south of Augsburg. It is best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held in 1924, after the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, and where he dictated his memoirs &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to Rudolf Hess.

The prison was used by the Allied powers during the Occupation of Germany for holding Nazi War Criminals. In 1946, General Joseph T. McNarney, commander in chief of U.S. Forces of Occupation in Germany, renamed Landsberg War Criminal Prison No. 1.

The Americans closed the war crimes facility in 1958. Full control of the prison was then handed over to the Federal Republic of Germany. Landsberg is now maintained by the Prison Service of the Bavarian Ministry of Justice.

==Early years==
Landsberg Prison, which is in the town&#x27;s western outskirts, was completed in 1910. The facility was designed with an &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; frontage by . Within its walls, the four brick-built cell blocks were constructed in a cross-shape orientation. This allowed guards to watch all wings simultaneously from a central location (based on the Panopticon style).
Landsberg, which was used for holding convicted criminals and those awaiting sentencing, was also designated a &quot;&quot; (&quot;fortress confinement&quot;) prison. &#x27;Festungshaft&#x27; was a lighter form of imprisonment, usually for high-ranked convicts. Prisoners were excluded from forced labor and had reasonably comfortable cells. They were also allowed to receive visitors. Anton Graf von Arco-Valley, who shot Bavarian prime minister Kurt Eisner, was given a &#x27;Festungshaft&#x27; sentence in February 1919.

In 1924 Adolf Hitler spent 264 days incarcerated in Landsberg after being convicted of treason following the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich the previous year. During his imprisonment, Hitler dictated and then wrote his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; with assistance from his deputy, Rudolf Hess.

Numerous foreign political prisoners of the Nazis were deported to Germany and imprisoned in Landsberg. Between early 1944 and the end of the war, at least 210 prisoners died in Landsberg as a result of mistreatment or execution.

==United States Army==


During the occupation of Germany by the Allies after World War II, the US Army designated the prison as &quot;War Criminal Prison No. 1&quot; to hold convicted Nazi war criminals. It was run and guarded by personnel from the United States Army&#x27;s Military Police (MPs).

The first condemned prisoners arrived at Landsberg prison in December 1945. These war criminals had been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity at the Dachau Trials which had begun a month earlier.

Between 1945 and 1946, the prison housed a total of 110 prisoners convicted at the subsequent Nuremberg trials, a further 1416 war criminals from the Dachau trials and 21 prisoners convicted in the . (These were military tribunals conducted by the American forces in Japan between August 1946 and January 1947 to prosecute 23 German officials who had continued to assist the Japanese military in Shanghai after the surrender of Nazi Germany.) 

In five and half years, Landsberg Prison was the place of execution of 252 condemned war criminals, all of them by hanging. Executions were carried out expeditiously. In May 1946, 28 former SS guards from Dachau were hanged within a four-day period. Bodies that were not claimed were buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery next to the Spöttingen chapel.

The prison was also used for the executions of common criminals. Thirty-three common criminals, including one U.S. soldier who had been court-martialed for murdering a civilian, were executed between 1947 and 1949, 29 of them by firing squad.

==Closure==

By 1948 the Bavarian Ministry of Justice&#x27;s Association for the Welfare of Prisoners (&quot;Vereinigung für die Wohlfahrt von Gefangenen des Bayerischen Staatsministeriums der Justiz&quot;) managed the needs of the prisoners held by the American military. With the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 and its abolition of the death penalty, calls from politicians, the churches, industrialists, and artists resulted in numerous petitions being made to close down War Criminal Prison No. 1. as part of a general effort to bring freedom for all Germans convicted of war crimes. In the last half of 1950 and the first half of 1951, thousands of Germans took part in demonstrations outside Landsberg prison to demand pardons for all the war criminals while the German media coverage was overwhelmingly on the side of the condemned, who were depicted as the innocent victims of American &quot;lynch law&quot;. Although the protestors at Landsberg claimed to be good-faith opponents of capital punishment itself, and not motivated by any kind of pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic feelings, their actions belied their words. When a group of about 300 Jewish counter-protestors arrived at Landsberg demanding the execution of war criminals on 7 January 1951, the German protestors demanding amnesty began to chant the Nazi-era slogan &quot;&quot;Juden raus!&quot; &quot;Juden raus!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Jews out! Jews out!&quot;) and then proceed to beat up the Jewish protestors.

The German historian Norbert Frei observed that almost all of the politicians who demanded freedom for condemned prisoners at Landsberg at various protest rallies outside the prison, such as Richard Jaeger of the CSU, later became prominent advocates of restoring capital punishment, which strongly suggested that what people like Jaeger objected to was not executions in general, but the executions of Nazi war criminals. Another politician who spoke at the protest rallies outside Landsberg prison was Gebhard Seelos of the Bavaria Party, who called the prisoners of Landsberg together with Heligoland—which was being used as target practice by the RAF—to be &quot;beacons of the German &quot;Volk&quot; in their struggle for justice, peace and the reconciliation of nations&quot;. Seelos went on to compare the suffering of the condemned prisoners at Landsberg with that of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and argued that to execute the prisoners on death row at Landsberg would be an act every bit as &quot;inhumane&quot; as the Holocaust. Seelos&#x27;s speech drew loud applause from the crowd. Frei called Seelos&#x27;s speech, with its claim that the war criminals facing execution at Landsberg were just as much victims as the Jews that they killed in the Holocaust, a &quot;breathtaking&quot; exercise in moral equivalence.

In early 1951 the Bavarian parliament passed a resolution declaring that all military prisoners at Landsberg, Werl, and Wittlich should be recognized as POWs, making them the financial responsibility of the Federal German government. On 2 January 1951, the West German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, met the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, John J. McCloy, to argue that the status of the Landsberg prisoners was not so much a legal question as a political one, and that to execute the Landsberg prisoners would ruin forever any effort at having the Federal Republic play its role in the Cold War. On 31 January 1951 McCloy, under very strong pressure from German public opinion, agreed to review the sentences from the Nuremberg and Dachau trials. Out of 28 prisoners condemned to death, seven death sentences were confirmed. Other convicts, like the industrialist Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, were pardoned by McCloy. The sentences for many other war criminals who were not on death row were also reduced.

The five death sentences confirmed by McCloy were the so-called &quot;worst of the worst&quot; at Landsberg, were Oswald Pohl, Paul Blobel, Otto Ohlendorf, Werner Braune, Erich Naumann. Two additional death sentences from the Dachau trials were confirmed by General Thomas T. Handy, that of (an SS sergeant at Mühldorf, a Dachau sub-camp), and (adjutant of Buchenwald). Neither Adenauer nor German public opinion was satisfied by the decisions of McCloy and Handy decision, and as a result, throughout the first half of 1951 the Federal Republic continued to lobby McCloy to pardon the seven condemned men while the huge demonstrations for amnesty continued at Landsberg, demanding freedom for the &quot;Landsberg Seven&quot;. The final executions were conducted on 7 June 1951.

By the middle of the fifties, these inmates began to be seen not as war criminals, but as political prisoners or prisoners of war. For instance, in 1955, the Landsberg city council asked their mayor &quot;to work for the overdue release of the political prisoners&quot; in the Landsberg prison. Moreover, the FRG government in Bonn decided the convictions of war criminals by military courts were to be regarded as foreign convictions and therefore did not become part of an individual&#x27;s criminal record. In 1956, the U.S. relinquished most of the prison to West Germany. The inmates still serving time under U.S. convictions were moved to a small section.

In May 1958, the United States Army relinquished full control of Landsberg Prison when the last four prisoners were released from custody. Three of them were former SS officers who had been convicted during the Einsatzgruppen Trials between 1947 and 1948. They had originally been sentenced to death, but were spared by the partial amnesty in 1951.

Management of the facility was transferred to the civilian Bavarian Ministry of Justice.

==Today==
The prison is now run as a progressive correctional facility and provides training, skills and medical help for the prisoners. There are 36 courses in the central training centre, which provide training for occupations such as bakers, electricians, painters, butchers, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, heating and ventilation workers and bricklayers. Uli Hoeneß served his sentence for tax fraud in Landsberg Prison.

<text>, or MHCB, was the corporate and investment banking subsidiary of Mizuho Financial Group, the second-biggest Japanese financial services conglomerate, prior to the reintegration of investment banking services under the Mizuho Bank name in July 2013.

==History==
MHCB was created in April 2002 by the merger of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank&#x27;s corporate and investment banking division with the Industrial Bank of Japan. Backed by Mizuho Financial Group&#x27;s credit ratings and financial solidity, MHCB was positioned as a major player in financial markets and among Japan&#x27;s leading corporate and investment banks by market share. The brokerage arm Mizuho Securities was also a primary dealer in the U.S. Treasury securities market. MHCB opened a branch in Wuxi, China in 2006 in a bid to support transactions with Japanese companies operating in the city. The bank also had a branch in the Philippines, partnering with the Bank of the Philippine Islands. In 2013, it merged with the former Mizuho Bank, with the unified institution being &quot;Mizuho Bank&quot;.

<doc id="1132646" wikidata="Q5717012" url="?curid=1132646" title="Henry A. P. Muhlenberg">
<text>Henry Augustus Philip Muhlenberg (May 13, 1782 – August 11, 1844) was an American political leader and diplomat. He was a member of the Muhlenberg family political dynasty.

==Early life==
Henry Augustus Philip Muhlenberg was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on May 13, 1782. Henry was the son of Mary Catherine (née Hall) Muhlenberg and Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg, a prominent clergyman and botanist.

His paternal grandfather was Henry Muhlenberg, a German born Lutheran pastor who was sent to North America as a missionary. His paternal grandmother, Anna Maria (née Weiser) Muhlenberg was the daughter of Colonial leader, Conrad Weiser. Among Henry&#x27;s uncles were Revolutionary War leaders, Frederick Muhlenberg, later the 1st Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Peter Muhlenberg, who served as the 8th Vice-President of Pennsylvania under Benjamin Franklin before his election as a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania.

==Career==
Muhlenberg studied theology and was ordained a Lutheran minister in 1802. He served as pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in Reading, Pennsylvania, from April 1803 to June 1829.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.

===Political career===
In 1828, Muhlenberg was elected to the United States House of Representatives to serve in the 21st United States Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat. He was reelected, as a Jacksonian, to the 22nd through 24th United States Congresses. On December 9, 1834, he wrote to John M. Read, later the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, about James Buchanan&#x27;s election to the United States Senate, stating: &quot;I rejoice in the election of our friend Buchanan&quot; and that &quot;he will be an honor to the State and of much service to our friends.&quot;

Muhlenberg was again reelected to the 25th Congress, this time as a Democrat, and served from March 4, 1829, until his resignation on February 9, 1838, when he was appointed the first United States Minister to the Austrian Empire on February 8, 1838. He presented his credentials in Vienna on November 7, 1838, and served until September 18, 1840, when he left his post and was succeeded by Daniel Jenifer.

He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Pennsylvania twice in 1835 and 1838. He was nominated by the Democratic Party a third time in 1844, but died before the election took place.

==Personal life==
Muhlenberg was twice married. His first marriage was in 1805 to Mary Elizabeth Muhlenberg (1784–1806). Mary died on March 21, 1806, giving birth to a daughter:

* Mary Elizabeth Muhlenberg (1806–1838), who married the Rev. Ehrgott Jonathan Deininger (1801–1881).

After her death, he remarried to Rebecca Hiester (1781–1841) on June 7, 1808. Rebecca was the daughter of Elizabeth (née Witman) Hiester and Joseph Hiester, the 5th governor of Pennsylvania. Together, they were the parents of:

* Emma Elizabeth Muhlenberg, who died in infancy.
* Hiester Henry Muhlenberg (1812–1886), who married Amelia Howard (1817–1852). After her death, he married Katharine Spang Hunter (1835–1913).
* Emma Elizabeth Muhlenberg (1817–1833), who died unmarried.
* Rosa Catharine Muhlenberg (1821–1867), who married Gustavus Anthony Nicolls (1817–1886).
* Henry Augustus Muhlenberg (1823–1854), who was elected to Congress and married his cousin, Ann Hall Muhlenberg.

Muhlenberg died in Reading, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 1844, and is interred at the Charles Evans Cemetery.

===Descendants===
Through his son Henry, he was the grandfather of Henry Augustus Muhlenberg III, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1892.

<doc id="1132661" wikidata="Q558250" url="?curid=1132661" title="Kevin Hartman">
<text>Kevin Eugene Hartman (born May 25, 1974) is an American former soccer player who played 17 seasons in Major League Soccer, being on the field for a record 37,260 minutes. Nicknamed &quot;El Gato&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the cat&quot;) because of his agility, reflexes, physical qualities, and shot-stopping ability, Hartman has more saves than any other goalkeeper in MLS history, and was the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 1999. Considered to be one of the greatest and most successful goalkeepers in MLS history, he was also known for his longevity.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
Hartman attended Radford High School in Radford, Virginia, where he made the school&#x27;s varsity team and served as backup goalkeeper in 1989. As a sophomore, he started for a young Radford High Team that went 1–12, where Hartman once gave up six goals in a half. That Radford High team won the Region IV Title in 1992 over Blacksburg High School and lost in the state semi-finals. RHS would have likely contended for the state title in 1992; however, between his sophomore and junior year at Radford High School, Hartman moved with his family to the Palos Verdes in California, where he enrolled in Palos Verdes High School, playing on the junior varsity squad for the 1990–1991 season. Before his senior year, Palos Verdes High School merged with Rolling Hills High School and Miraleste High School to form Palos Verdes Peninsula High School. As a senior, Hartman played on the Peninsula High School varsity squad, though he only started a few of the games early in the season. Hartman also played on a club team known as the San Pedro FC Santos, headed by Pat Nave of San Pedro, California.

Known as having a strong work ethic, Hartman often woke up early in the morning to practice in the nearby city of Long Beach. After graduating from high school in the Spring of 1992, Hartman went on to play college soccer at California State University, Dominguez Hills and UCLA. He began his college career at Dominguez Hills, playing there in 1992 and 1993, before transferring to UCLA, where he played in 1995 and 1996, redshirting in 1994.

===Professional===
====LA Galaxy====
Hartman was drafted 29th overall in the third round of the 1997 MLS College Draft by Los Angeles Galaxy. He played very little his rookie year, as he was stuck behind renowned Mexican keeper Jorge Campos. After the season, Hartman, or &quot;El Gato&quot; (dubbed by &quot;La Opinión&quot; reporter Ramiro Gonzalez),was selected third overall by Chicago Fire in the expansion draft; the Galaxy quickly reacquired him, however, trading Campos and Chris Armas to the Fire in exchange for Hartman and Danny Pena. With Campos in Chicago, Hartman seized the starting job, starting 28 games for the team kept it until his departure from the team, except for a brief period in 2001 when Matt Reis briefly took his job. He was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 1999 following an especially good season. Hartman helped the Galaxy win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 2000, the U.S. Open Cup in 2001 and 2005, and the MLS Cup in 2002 and 2005.

====Other MLS teams====
After ten years with the Galaxy, Hartman was traded to Kansas City Wizards following the 2006 season.

On March 28, 2009, Hartman broke the all-time MLS saves record of 1,136 stops previously held by Tony Meola during a Wizards game against Colorado Rapids.

Kevin left Kansas City when he failed to agree to a new contract extension with the club. Hartman&#x27;s rights were traded to FC Dallas in return for a conditional second round 2012 MLS SuperDraft pick.

On September 16, 2010, in a match against New York Red Bulls, Kevin was injured by Red Bulls striker Thierry Henry, who wanted to kick the ball to celebrate a goal. Henry kicked the ball and the follow through kicked Hartman&#x27;s foot, causing him an injury.

Hartman was named to the MLS Team of Week 8 and 9 in the 2011 MLS season for his consecutive clean sheets against D.C. United, Philadelphia Union, and Toronto FC.

On June 4, 2011, Hartman became the first goalkeeper in MLS history to record 100 shutouts.

On July 4, 2012, Hartman played his 400th match in MLS.

Following the 2012 MLS season, Hartman&#x27;s contract was not renewed by FC Dallas. Hartman entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft, and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

On March 21, 2013, Hartman joined the New York Red Bulls as a free agent saying &quot;to play and also have the opportunity to get into a little bit more of the coaching side of things.&quot;

<text>EC8OR (pronounced &quot;Ecator&quot;, a contraction of &quot;Eradicator&quot;) is a German digital hardcore band founded in 1995 by Patric Catani and Gina V. D&#x27;Orio and signed by Alec Empire&#x27;s Digital Hardcore Recordings record label. The music was in the same vein of Atari Teenage Riot&#x27;s style of early Breakcore and hardcore techno with a punk edge, which led to EC8OR been overlooked by fans of digital hardcore recordings, but EC8OR employed more low-res ideas as the first album was entirely composed on Amiga 500 and with a microphone.

EC8OR gained considerable attention in North America in 1997, when the Beastie Boys&#x27; pet-label Grand Royal Records released &quot;All Of Us Can Be Rich...&quot;, a collection of earlier material on Digital Hardcore Recordings. This led to features and press on the band in Rolling Stone and Alternative Press.

The duo released 5 albums from 1995 to 1999 and have continued to record after the great DHR implosion of the millennium, and still collaborate often, although Patric and Gina are no longer signed to Digital Hardcore Recordings. Patric would later display his dislike of the state the label is currently in, as he said in an interview &quot;The fact that all the bands surrounding [Atari Teenage Riot] just got used for their sellout idea–to have a whole &#x27;movement&#x27; and &#x27;followers&#x27;–led to psychological warfare which some people didn&#x27;t survive. There was no trust anymore at some point and no communication. It was very strange for [artists on the] label to read in the New Music Express or other papers all these weird, made-up stories [about them]. The records were produced with different budgets and went through different channels and distributions. For me, it was necessary to leave that crap behind.&quot;

EC8OR is on a permanent hiatus although the duo played a one-off gig in Dresden in 2005, and have recently collaborated under the name A*class, whereas Gina still performs in her other band Cobra Killer and with former Shizuo vocalist Annika Trost.

<text>Lloyd Theodore Poe (born September 10, 1948) is an American politician who represented Texas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2005 to 2019. Poe was the first Republican to represent the 2nd district.

In November 2017, Poe announced that he would retire from Congress, and not seek re-election in 2018.

==Judicial career==
After serving as a chief felony prosecutor in Harris County (Houston) for eight years, Poe was appointed a felony court judge in Harris County in 1981, becoming one of the youngest judges in the state. In this position, he gained national prominence for his unusual criminal sentences that included ordering thieves to carry signs in front of stores from which they stole. However, in at least one case, Poe amended the sentence afterwards without notifying the victim&#x27;s family.

==Elections to United States Congress==
In November 2004, Poe ran for the U.S. House in the 2nd District. The district had previously been the 9th, represented by four-term Democrat Nick Lampson. However, as the result of a controversial mid-decade redistricting, the new 2nd was considerably more Republican than the old 9th. It lost Galveston and the area around the Johnson Space Center, while picking up several heavily Republican areas north of Houston, including Poe&#x27;s home in Humble. Poe won 55% of the vote to Lampson&#x27;s 43%. While Lampson trounced Poe in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Poe swamped Lampson in the Harris County portion of the district.

Poe made border security a centerpiece of his re-election strategy, calling for &quot;more [National] Guardsmen on the border front&quot;.

In November 2006, Poe won a second term with 65.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat Gary Binderim, who took 32.7%.

In November 2008 and 2010, Poe did not face a Democratic challenger in the general election. In 2008, he defeated Libertarian Craig Wolfe, taking 88.9% of the vote to Wolfe&#x27;s 11.1%. In 2010, he defeated Libertarian David Smith with 88.6 percent of the vote to Smith&#x27;s 11.4 percent.

Poe&#x27;s district was made significantly more compact in the 2010s round of redistricting. It was cut back to an exclusively Harris County-based district, wheeling from Humble through northern and western Houston to just outside downtown. This district was slightly less Republican than its predecessor, and Poe was elected three more times from this district with over 60 percent of the vote.

Poe announced on November 7, 2017, that he would not seek re-election in 2018.

==Committee assignments==
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia
** Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Vice Chair)
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet
** Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement

In addition to Poe&#x27;s committee assignments, he is the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Victim&#x27;s Rights Caucus. Since 2012, he has been the head of the Congressional Serbian Caucus. He is also a member of the Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, the Tea Party Caucus, the House Baltic Caucus and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus.

==Political positions==
===Taxes===
Poe is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

===Abortion===
Poe received a 0 rating from the abortion rights group NARAL in 2007 and a rating of 100 from the National Right to Life Committee in 2007–2008. He also voted for the Prohibiting Federal Funding of Abortion Services amendment on November 7, 2009.

===Fiscal policy===
In 2008, the National Taxpayers Union, an organization that supports &quot;lower taxes and smaller government&quot;, gave Poe the grade B+, and in 2007 received a rating of 90 from the group Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that advocates &quot;taxes [that] are simpler, [and] flatter&quot;. Poe voted against the 2009 Economic Stimulus Package (HR 1) and the 2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 13). The Club for Growth PAC gave him a power ranking of 85.85%.

===Healthcare===
Poe favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Poe does not support what he calls &quot;government-run health care&quot;. Poe voted &quot;Nay&quot; on the Health Care and Insurance Law Amendments bill on November 7, 2009. In 2008, Poe voted for the Medicare Bill (HR 6331). Poe supports healthcare reform that would &quot;Allow insurance to be purchased across state lines, provide for a safety net for catastrophic injury or illness…and allow for a health savings account&quot;. Poe resigned from the Freedom Caucus in March 2017, after the Caucus&#x27;s opposition to the American Health Care Act of 2017 contributed to Speaker Ryan&#x27;s decision to pull the bill. Poe supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act before its collapse.

On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act.

===Immigration ===
Poe is an advocate of stronger action against illegal immigration and increased security on the Mexico–United States border. He voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and against the DREAM Act when it was introduced in 2010. He opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, calling it &quot;an imperial decree&quot; that violated immigration law.

Poe co-sponsored, along with fellow Republican Representative Steve King, the &quot;Deport Foreign Convicted Criminals Act of 2011&quot; (), which would require the U.S. government to deny certain visas to citizens of nations that refuse to accept convicted foreign nationals that the U.S. is seeking to deport. If passed, the law would mandate visa denials to nationals of 153 nations worldwide. Poe&#x27;s bill was opposed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which noted that the bill would block visas issued to citizens of American allies, including Israel, Britain, and Canada. The bill was also criticized by Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who called it &quot;the most stupid bill I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and stated it would wipe out the U.S. tourism industry.

===Human trafficking===
Poe introduced the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, a bill to combat human trafficking. The 2015 bill passed the House in a 420–3 vote and, following a delay, passed the Senate in a 99–0 vote. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama in May 2015.

==Controversies==
In 1998, Judge Poe was known for creative sentencing, including ordering offenders to shovel manure, a practice which led to the nickname &quot;The King of Shame.&quot; Poe explained, &quot;The people I see have too good a self-esteem. I want them to feel guilty about what they&#x27;ve done. I don&#x27;t want &#x27;em to leave the courthouse having warm fuzzies inside.&quot; Poe&#x27;s &quot;public notice&quot; sentences included ordering a drunk driver to stand outside a bar, wearing a sign that said &quot;I killed two people while driving drunk.&quot;

As a state judge, in November 2002, Poe ruled that he would permit the PBS documentary show &quot;Frontline&quot; to videotape jury deliberations of a capital murder case. There was considerable concern that this would affect the result of the trial, possibly by skewing the composition of the jury, and the decision was appealed by Harris County prosecutors. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state&#x27;s highest criminal appellate court, ruled against Poe&#x27;s decision and prohibited the videotaping.
On June 7, 2009, Poe signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 1503, the bill introduced as a reaction to conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. president Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen. On July 23, 2009, he appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; in which he claimed that Certifications of Live Birth issued by Hawaii State Department of Health cannot be used to obtain a U.S. passport, which is untrue. His support of H.R. 1503 and public advocacy for it earned him a negative editorial in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;.

In August 2011, AlterNet reported that Poe, along with John Culberson and Michael McCaul, was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers&#x27; families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier&#x27;s funeral. The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to Veterans Affairs (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals. The VA, however, asserted that this claim was &quot;blatantly false&quot; and that VA respects a family&#x27;s &quot;rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries&quot;.

In 2017, his bill to have Congress monitor religious reform and interpretation in Saudi Arabia aroused international concerns that the United States was behind societal upheavals in that country.

==Personal life==
Poe and his wife, Carol, have four children (Kim, Kara, Kurt, and Kellee).

Poe announced on July 13, 2016, that he had recently been diagnosed with leukemia and would be seeking treatment at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

==In popular culture==
Poe was interviewed about his controversial creative sentencing practices while still a Texas district judge by Jon Ronson for Ronson&#x27;s 2015 book, &quot;So You&#x27;ve Been Publicly Shamed&quot;.

In 2011, Poe gave a speech on the house floor concerning excessive spending by the Justice Department on refreshments served at conferences at the Capitol Hilton. He expressed significant disapproval that muffins apparently costing $16 each were served at the conferences. The speech was made notable by his humorous opening line, &quot;Madame Speaker, do you know the muffin man?&quot; The speech was further popularized by his inclusion in a Songify the News video by the Gregory Brothers in which he is autotuned, appearing to sing a song about the muffin man.

<doc id="1132688" wikidata="Q4858349" url="?curid=1132688" title="Barang (Khmer word)">
<text>Barang ( or ) is a Khmer term meaning French, a Cambodian rendition of the word France. 

As a remnant of the French colonial rule in Cambodia and the resulting significant French minority in Cambodia, in some regions of Cambodia the locals will often simply assume people of European ancestry to be French and refer to them as &quot;barang&quot;.

==Etymology==
Since Khmer phonology does not have the unvoiced fricative &quot;f&quot;, it is pronounced with the voiced plosive &quot;b&quot;. In many of Khmer&#x27;s loanwords, an &quot;n&quot; often changes to an &quot;ng&quot;, as in the word &quot;Allœmáng&quot; (, &quot;Germany&quot; or &quot;German&quot;) which comes from the French word &quot;Allemand&quot;. The rarely used Khmer term &quot;Barăngsês&quot; () also shows its relation to the word .

==Usage==
&quot;Barang&quot; is also used as a suffix in some Khmer words such as &quot;moan barang&quot; (, &quot;French chicken&quot;) which refers to a turkey as well as &quot;khtuem barang&quot; (, &quot;French allium&quot;) which refers to an onion.

<doc id="1132697" wikidata="Q8037570" url="?curid=1132697" title="Wrangler (profession)">
<text>In North America, a wrangler is someone employed to professionally handle animals, especially livestock, but sometimes other types of animals including bears, wolf packs, big cats, primates and reptiles. The word &quot;wrangler&quot; is derived from the Low German &quot;wrangeln&quot; meaning &quot;to dispute&quot; or &quot;to wrestle&quot;. It was first documented in 1377. Its use as a noun was first recorded in 1547. Its reference to a &quot;person in charge of horses or cattle&quot; or &quot;herder&quot; was first recorded in 1888.

A wrangler is an individual involved in the process of taming, controlling and handling various animals, specifically horses. Traditionally this process involves herding cattle and bringing horses in from the paddock. Wranglers often work for other cowboys or tourists who want to ride on North American ranches. Variations of wrangling include managing herds, dude-wrangling, rodeo and managing horses as a part of stunt work in the film industry. Wranglers are also considered a subcategory of cowboys, being responsible for herding horses rather than cattle. The profession of wrangling has developed over time, as wranglers are educated to perform more activities as the tourism sector has become increasingly important in the employment of wranglers.

Wranglers also handle the horses and other animals during the making of motion pictures. A dude-wrangler is a cowboy or guide that takes non-wranglers and non-cowboys (dudes) on western riding horseback trips.

In the film industry, a wrangler is also one who professionally searches for and/or handles particular products on film and television programs, and music videos, such as custom cars or animals.

== History ==
During the 1920s the wrangler&#x27;s transition into the service economy reliant on tourism, while keeping alive the ‘romantic West,’ contrasted the original conception of wrangling as an occupation as it was previously characterised by self-reliance and expertise. Wrangling has also been impacted by developments in technology and science influencing the scale and speed at which they can herd horses.

== Education ==
Wrangling in the film industry, as part of stunt work, requires extensive training and commitment in various disciplines. This includes the ability of the wrangler to train horses for stunts and liberty work over long periods of time. Wranglers from local areas can also be familiar with smaller groups of horses and therefore identify an individual horse from the herd. They are trained to identify horse behaviour and a given horse&#x27;s age, fitness, gender, and health in an instant. In order to prevent injury or health concerns with horses, the wrangler possesses a specialised role in an outfit. An outfit is a band or unit of cowboys, cooks, and wranglers who would travel together in roundups and on trails.

Older wranglers are often responsible for the training of younger ones, passing down common knowledge and advice, rather than a broader and institutionalised education system. Wranglers are often prospective cowhands wrangling in order to learn the basics about stock work. Education therefore does not consist of formal instruction. Instead, wranglers and cowboys are expected to learn on the job and grow into higher positions of management.

== Activities ==

=== Film industry ===
The wrangler, also associated with the care and maintenance of the horse, is in some circumstances responsible for maintaining the ethical treatment of horses. Ethical issues about the modern management of horses, such as radio collars placed on wild horses (which could cut into the necks of growing horses), also reinforced in wranglers a scepticism of scientific and modern procedures in wrangling and reinforced traditional methods. Wranglers must also ensure that living and training facilities are suitable and large enough to house a certain number of horses.

Wranglers involved in the production of &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)&quot; revealed that despite concerns they had displayed about the farm in which the horses were being held, the production company was responsible for the deaths of up to 27 animals. The animal wranglers were previously fired from production but were also supported by claims from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) suggesting that issues concerning the housing of horses stemmed from overcrowding and unsafe barbed fencing.

Another example is horses in the film &quot;Horses of McBride (2012)&quot; in which there were extremely specific requirements for the cast of horses required. The film, depicting the struggle to save two starving horses, required extremely malnourished black and sorrel horses. One such horse, Lady, was typecast as needing to be rescued. A suitable horse was discovered by the film&#x27;s horse wrangler and rescued from bleak conditions and given adequate food and restored to full health. Therefore, the wrangler&#x27;s role in this industry requires much research and casting behind the scenes, as stunt doubles were also required.

Wranglers could also be required to train actors to ride and drive horse-drawn wagons, and have a historical knowledge of horses and their uses. Stunt-horses had to be very specific, not only fulfilling the demands of the director and actors, but also the type of horse required to perform a specific stunt. Once the right horse has been found, the horse must be trained and gain confidence. The wrangler is responsible for being aware of the horse&#x27;s capabilities and limitations in these stunts. A ‘head wrangler’ on set may also be responsible for providing and sourcing all horses required for a stunt. Wranglers in the film industry are often involved with a larger variety of animals other than horses, including sheep and other livestock.

Many horses trained by wranglers are generally horses in the background of scenes, as opposed to being ridden by actors. They are required to remain calm and well-behaved and must be accustomed to lights, activity and cameras. Wranglers in films are often required to work long days, and care for various horses throughout. Often horses need to simply walk from one end of the shot to other and in other circumstances the wrangler is required to ride them. They can also be cast as extras such as lorry drivers and wagon drivers.

The wrangler is also required to provide various types of horse equipment and tack.

=== Dude-wranglers ===
Dude-wranglers are responsible for training horses and leading trips, as has long been custom, and have come to be expected to be charismatic and gentlemanly as part of their service. There was often no explicit indication that the dude-wranglers required to be handsome and characteristic, nevertheless, it was often clear that women were expectant of this. The dude-wrangler stereotype suggests that he was to be talented, outgoing and experienced, what would become a standard of Western masculinity. The role of the wrangler therefore became a role in which this masculinity could be proven.

The wrangler was also responsible for minding children on trails, accommodating for the whole family. Often the individual would expect to be able to become a competent horseman under the instruction of a horse wrangler.

Dude-wranglers are required to handle people just as well as they handle horses. They are required to interact with guests and sell the ranch experience as they provide funds for the ranch just as cattle do for others. The wranglers are a type of mediator between visitor and land, as they require an extensive knowledge of equipment, veterinary care and horsemanship, while the visitor does not. The wrangler is required to provide a pleasing temperament despite strenuous tasks, for it is what keeps him his job. He is often required to comply to a standard of presentation concerning attire, hygiene and relationship with guests.

=== Ranch work ===
Breaking a horse is another responsibility of the wrangler. Traditionally this would consist of roping and corralling the bronc, or unbroken, wild horse, and attempting to ride it until it submitted to the rider. The wrangler would continue to buck on the horse and accustom it to both bridle and saddle. The bronc riders job was considered to, “educate,” these horses and for others, to take the education out of them, therefore either taming wild horses, or un-taming timid ones. These horses were broken in order to ride or drive them, often broken by wranglers for themselves or neighbours. The horses could then be traded or swapped.

Modern wranglers have learned to communicate with a horse through subtle observation and body language. The idea is to produce a positive relationship between horse and wrangler, as the horse ‘wants’ to perform an action for the rider, rather than being forced to do so. This is a type of natural horsemanship. Often a wrangler could break horses for a specific purpose, such as younger geldings for riding, and could tell the suitability of a horse from only a few moments in the saddle.

Wranglers in locations such as Shenandoah in West Virginia advocate a type of modern wrangling which places the horse&#x27;s wellbeing at the forefront of their practice. As well as completing the usual duties; grooming, feeding and watering the horses; the wranglers also monitor the health of the horses. The wranglers also tailor the horses dietary requirements to best suit them, as well as customisable bridles and saddles. Modern wranglers such as these also focus on building a trusting partnership between horse and rider based on natural horsemanship. The wrangler is also responsible for the sale of horses, pairing clients with horses of the appropriate type and personality.

Wranglers were also involved in ranch work such as cutting horses and cattle (that is, separating them from the rest of the herd) as well as branding cattle. Each ranch had a specific brand that was to be cast onto calves in order to identify the ownership of cattle. They can also be responsible for basic veterinary care, such as transporting animals, feeding them, branding them and accustoming or ‘gentling’ them to riders.

A horse wrangler is also part of what is known as a trail crew, consisting of drovers, a trail boss, a cook and the wrangler. These trails would herd between 2, 000 and 3, 000 cattle over a number of days.

During the day the wrangler, or more colloquially the ‘jingler,’ drives the horses and finds pasture for them, often rounding them up multiple times in one day in order for the cowboys or ranch hands to change horses. This is known as the remuda. In the Old West of America it was also historically referred to as a cavvy. The remuda must be spread out in suitable pasture, watered and easily separated into pens (corralled) for mounting when required in order for the wrangler to be performing his role successfully. In order to do so, the wrangler is required to know each horse and be able to locate them. The wrangler is therefore responsible for the well-being and overall condition of the herd.

When not performing these roles, the wrangler also works in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning. This involves collecting wood and water for the kitchen, chopping wood, preparing the food. The wrangler is further responsible for setting up and disassembling the campsite, hooking and unhooking the wagon, loading the wagon and taking down the rope corral. Working and partnering with the wrangler is the nighthawk who watches over the herd at night and returns them to the wrangler in the morning. Often when on a farmer&#x27;s or ‘grangers’ roundup, the outfit would find an empty field or pasture to set up for the night. They would either set up a large tent for the night, and when in good weather, would roll out the beds on any suitable flat surface outside.

== Demography ==
Wranglers are often the youngest men of the ranch and have often been romanticised for their toughness, looks and masculinity, especially as represented in film, literature and iconography. Typically wranglers have been dominantly represented as men, due to the tough physical demands of wrangling. However, women performing similar tasks is not uncommon. Although there was this emphasis on male riders, there was equal opportunity to females as well. Some accounts emphasise the reliability and keenness of a female wrangler as a desirable trail rider. Most of the wranglers found at round-up events in the past were men, but a few women could also be observed.

Many wranglers are also long-time locals who have grown up participating in equine and rodeo events, often with a similar heritage. Wranglers with these backgrounds could begin at ages as young as 10 years old. They would hear and see a lot at such a young age, and expected to be tough and durable.

Wranglers and cowboys are becoming less and less common as they are replaced with modern occupations such as biologists and animal researchers who are often more reliant on education and theoretical knowledge, rather than having extensive practice with horses. The idea that the horse specialists, such as wranglers, have spent large amounts of time with horses, are familiar and can identify with them is also becoming less common.

The three main states that remain occupied by wranglers in the United States are California, Arizona and Wyoming.

<text>William Cox Redfield (June 18, 1858 – June 13, 1932) was a Democratic politician from New York who served in both the U.S. Congress and as the first U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

== Biography ==
Appointed by President Woodrow Wilson, Redfield served as the first Secretary of Commerce from 1913 to 1919 after the division of the Department of Commerce and Labor.

Prior to his appointment, Redfield served as Commissioner of Public Works for Brooklyn. He then went on to represent New York&#x27;s 5th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in 1912, and a supporter of labor rights.

<doc id="1132704" wikidata="Q4344854" url="?curid=1132704" title="Denny's paradox">
<text>In biology, Denny&#x27;s paradox refers to the apparent impossibility of surface-dwelling animals such as the water strider generating enough propulsive force to move. It is named after biologist Mark Denny, and relates to animal locomotion on the surface layer of water.

If capillary waves are assumed to generate the momentum transfer to the water, the animal&#x27;s legs must move faster than the phase speed formula_1 of the waves, given by
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the acceleration due to gravity, formula_4 is the strength of surface tension, and formula_5 the density of water. For standard conditions, this works out to be about 0.23 m/s. In fact, water striders&#x27; legs move at speeds much less than this and, according to this physical picture, cannot move.

Writing in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, David Hu and John Bush state that Denny&#x27;s paradox &quot;rested on two flawed assumptions. First, water striders&#x27; motion was assumed to rely on the generation of capillary waves, since the propulsive force was thought to be that associated with wave drag on the driving leg. Second, in order to generate capillary waves, it was assumed that the strider leg speed must exceed the minimum wave speed, formula_6. We note that this second assumption is strictly true only for steady motions&quot;.

<text>A diaphragm arch is a transverse wall-bearing arch forming a partial wall dividing a vault or a ceiling into compartments while also bracing the walls.

When used under a wooden roof (with solid spandrels) it has the advantage of providing a partial firebreak. It was first used in Roman Syria, during the 2nd century AD. The diaphragm arch is present in Islamic, Carolingian, Ottonian and Romanesque architecture.

<text>James Maybrick (24 October 1838 – 11 May 1889) was a Liverpool cotton merchant. After his death, his wife, Florence Maybrick, was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The &quot;Aigburth Poisoning&quot; case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the Atlantic.

More than a century after his death, Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper, owing to his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book &quot;They All Love Jack&quot;, writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer. A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed during 1884 and 1885 upon the city of Austin, Texas, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.

==Life==
Maybrick was born in Liverpool, the son of William Maybrick, an engraver, and his wife, Susanna. He was christened on 12 November 1838, at St Peter&#x27;s Church in the city. He was named after a brother who had died the year before and was the Maybricks&#x27; third of seven sons.
Maybrick&#x27;s cotton trading business required him to travel regularly to the United States and in 1871 he settled in Norfolk, Virginia, to establish a branch office of his company. While there in 1874 he contracted malaria, which was then treated with a medication containing arsenic; he became addicted to the drug for the rest of his life. In 1880, Maybrick returned to the company&#x27;s offices in Britain. Sailing from New York City on 12 March 1880, he arrived in Liverpool six days later. During the journey he was introduced to Florence (Florie) Elizabeth Chandler, the daughter of a banker from Mobile, Alabama, and their relationship quickly blossomed. Despite the difference in their ages – he was 42, and she 18 – they began to plan their wedding immediately.

The wedding was delayed until 27 July 1881, when it took place at St James&#x27; Church, Piccadilly, London. The couple returned to Liverpool to live at Maybrick&#x27;s home, &quot;Battlecrease House&quot; in Aigburth, a suburb in the south of the city.

They had two children: a son, James Chandler (&quot;Bobo&quot;), born in 1882, and a daughter, Gladys Evelyn, born in 1886.

Maybrick continued to divide his time between the American and the British offices of his company and this may have caused difficulties within his marriage. He also resumed his relationships with his many mistresses, while his wife conducted an affair with an Alfred Brierley, a cotton broker. It is possible Florence embarked upon this on learning of her husband&#x27;s infidelity.

In Maybrick&#x27;s case a common-law wife, Sarah Ann Robertson, was identified. Sarah Ann is mentioned in her stepfather&#x27;s will as &quot;Sarah Ann Maybrick, wife of James&quot;.

==Death==
Maybrick&#x27;s health deteriorated suddenly on 27 April 1889, and he died fifteen days later at his home in Aigburth. The circumstances of his death were deemed suspicious by his brothers and an inquest, held in a local hotel, came to the verdict that arsenic poisoning was the most likely cause, administered by persons unknown.

Suspicion immediately fell on Florence, and she was arrested some days later. She stood trial at St George&#x27;s Hall, Liverpool, and after lengthy proceedings, the fairness of which was the subject of some debate in later years, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The way in which the judge conducted her trial was questioned, and this may have been the reason her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, some of which she served in a prison in Woking, Surrey, and then at the &quot;House of Detention&quot; at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

A re-examination of her case resulted in her release in 1904. She supported herself through various occupations until her death on 23 October 1941. From her initial incarceration until her death, she never saw her children again.

An episode of the BBC TV programme &quot;Murder, Mystery and My Family&quot;, broadcast on 27 July 2020, investigated whether Florence Maybrick&#x27;s conviction held credibility when investigated by modern-day means. The investigation was undertaken by Jeremy Dein QC (defence) and Sasha Wass QC (prosecution) and their findings were put before Crown Court Judge David Radford. From their investigations it appeared that Mrs Maybrick was subjected to the Victorian morality code by the judge and the jury. The judge in the Maybrick murder trial delivered his summing-up to the jury for two days. Modern experts, assisting the QCs, stated that Victorian society used arsenic as a beauty aid, and for someone like Mrs Maybrick to extract a small amount of the poison from flypaper would have been commonplace. In addition, the arsenic found in James Maybrick&#x27;s liver was 20 milligrams and a fatal dose would be more likely 100 milligrams. It was also discovered that Mr Maybrick had been self-prescribing medicines; he was taking a large amount of drugs, and only two of these drugs did not contain poison. As James Maybrick grew sicker, his brothers insisted that Florence be forbidden access to James, however, he grew yet sicker, and died. A modern-day expert on Victorian society was consulted by the QCs, and was asked whether the admission by way of a letter of a love affair between Mrs Maybrick and an associate of Mr Maybrick could in any way be reflected in the judge&#x27;s summing-up, thus prejudicing the jury. After the two QCs had informed the modern-day judge David Radford of their findings and with their expert advice, the Judge David Radford was left to consider the new evidence.

Judge David Radford, having considered all the evidence put forward by the QCs, said that the trial judge had presented a case against Mrs Maybrick based on Victorian attitudes to sexual scandal, and in his two-day summing up had blindsided the jury into giving a guilty verdict of murder by undermining her character. Therefore, in Radford&#x27;s opinion the verdict was unsafe.

==Family==
After their mother&#x27;s conviction and imprisonment, Maybrick&#x27;s children James and Gladys Evelyn were taken in by a Dr. Charles Chinner Fuller and his wife Gertrude, and the younger James changed his name to Fuller.

James Fuller became a mining engineer in British Columbia. In 1911, at the age of 29, while working at the Le Roi Gold Mine in Canada, he died after drinking cyanide, apparently thinking it was just a glass of water. His sister Gladys went to live in Ryde, Isle of Wight, with her uncle and aunt Michael and Laura (&quot;née&quot; Withers) Maybrick before marrying Frederick James Corbyn in Hampstead, London, in 1912. She died in South Wales in 1971, where the couple lived in their later years.

James Maybrick&#x27;s brother, Michael Maybrick, was a composer who published many pieces and songs under the name Stephen Adams. &quot;Good Company&quot; is one such example, but by far his best known work was the hymn &quot;The Holy City&quot;.

==Jack the Ripper diary==

In 1992, a document presented as James Maybrick&#x27;s diary surfaced, which claimed that he was Jack the Ripper. The diary&#x27;s author does not mention his own name, but offers enough hints and references consistent with Maybrick&#x27;s established life and habits that it is obvious readers are expected to believe it is him. The author of the document details alleged actions and crimes over a period of several months, taking credit for slaying the five victims most commonly credited to Jack the Ripper as well as for two other murders which have to date not been historically identified.

The diary was first introduced to the world by Michael Barrett, an unemployed former Liverpool scrap metal dealer, who claimed at the time that it had been given to him by a friend, Tony Devereux, in a pub. When this was queried, the story changed. Barrett&#x27;s wife Ann, formerly Graham, said that the diary had been in her family for as long as she could remember. She had asked Devereux to give it to her husband because he had literary aspirations and she thought he might write a book about it. She had not wanted to tell him her family owned it because she thought he would ask her father about it and relations between the two men were strained. It was published as &quot;The Diary of Jack the Ripper&quot; in 1993 to great controversy. Few experts gave it any credence from the outset, and most immediately dismissed it as a hoax, though some were open to the possibility it might be genuine. Debate was often heated, and one writer notes that the &quot;saga of the Maybrick diary is confusing, complicated and inescapably tortuous.&quot;

Tests carried out on the ink used in the diary produced contradictory findings. The first test, using thin layer chromatography (TLC) revealed the ink contained no iron, and was based on a synthetic dye called nigrosine, patented and commercially available in 1867, and in general use in writing inks by the 1870s. The second TLC test found nothing in the ink inconsistent with the date of 1888, and that the ink contained iron and sodium, but no nigrosine. The third TLC test found nothing inconsistent with the Victorian period. A fourth TLC test was attempted, but could not be carried out.

Several tests were carried out to find out whether the ink contained chloroacetamide, a preservative, in an effort to definitively date the ink. According to one source, chloroacetamide was introduced into the Merck Index in 1857, but not used commercially in ink until 1972. In 1995, Dr Earl Morris of the Dow Chemical Company stated that chloroacetamide has been found in preparations as early as 1857. A fourth test, this time using gas chromatography, found chloroacetamide present, at 6.5 parts per million. A fifth TLC test found traces of chloroacetamide, but this was attributed to contamination from the control. The test was carried out again, and no chloroacetamide was found.

Among the investigators were sceptic Joe Nickell and document expert Kenneth W. Rendell. In Rendell&#x27;s analysis, he was struck that the handwriting style seemed more 20th century than Victorian. He also noted factual contradictions and handwriting inconsistencies. Written in a genuine Victorian scrapbook, but with 20 pages at the front end torn out, he also found this suspect as there was no logical explanation for the purported author to use such a book.

In January 1995, Michael Barrett swore in two separate affidavits that he was &quot;the author of the Manuscript written by my wife Anne Barrett at my dictation which is known as The Jack the Ripper Diary.&quot; Adding to the confusion, however, was Barrett&#x27;s solicitor&#x27;s subsequent repudiation of his affidavit, then Barrett&#x27;s withdrawal of the repudiation.

Some people, including Robert Smith, the present owner of the diary and original publisher of the associated book by Shirley Harrison, insist it may be genuine. They argue that scientific dating methods have established that the book and ink used to write in it are from the 19th century; that the symptoms of arsenic addiction, claimed to be described accurately in the book, are known to very few persons; that some details of the murders provided in it were known only to police and the Ripper himself before the book&#x27;s publication; and that one of the original crime scene photographs shows the initials &quot;F. M.&quot; written on a wall behind the victim&#x27;s body in what appears to be blood. These, they claim, refer to Florence Maybrick, James&#x27;s wife, whose possible infidelities were the purported motivation for the murders. These claims are dismissed by the majority of experts.

===Pocket watch===
In June 1993, a gentleman&#x27;s pocket watch, made by William Verity of Rothwell (near Leeds) 
in 1847 or 1848, was presented by Albert Johnson of Wallasey. The watch has &quot;J. Maybrick&quot; scratched on the inside cover, along with the words &quot;I am Jack&quot;, as well as the initials of the five canonical Ripper victims. The watch was examined in 1993 by Dr Stephen Turgoose of the Corrosion and Protection Centre at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, using an electron microscope. He stated:
&quot;On the basis of the evidence...especially the order in which the markings were made, it is clear that the engravings pre-date the vast majority of superficial surface scratch marks...the wear apparent on the engravings, evidenced by the rounded edges of the markings and &#x27;polishing out&#x27; in places, would indicate a substantial age...whilst there is no evidence which would indicate a recent (last few years) origin...it must be emphasised that there are no features observed which conclusively prove the age of the engravings. They could have been produced recently, and deliberately artificially aged by polishing, but this would have been a complex multi-stage process...many of the features are only resolved by the scanning electron microscope, not being readily apparent in optical microscopy, and so, if they were of recent origin, the engraver would have to be aware of the potential evidence available from this technique, indicating a considerable skill and scientific awareness&quot;.

In 1994, the watch was taken to the Interface Analysis Centre at Bristol University and studied by Dr Robert Wild using an electron microscope and Auger electron spectroscopy. Dr Wild found that:
&quot;Provided the watch has remained in a normal environment, it would seem likely that the engravings were at least several tens of years age...in my opinion it is unlikely that anyone would have sufficient expertise to implant aged, brass particles into the base of the engravings&quot;.

<doc id="1132718" wikidata="Q539509" url="?curid=1132718" title="Michael McCaul">
<text>Michael Thomas McCaul Sr. (born January 14, 1962) is an American attorney, politician and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for . A member of the Republican Party, he chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security during the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses. His district stretches from Austin to Houston.

McCaul became the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the 118th Congress in 2023.

==Early life, education and legal career==
Born in Dallas, the son of Frances Jane (Lott) and James Addington McCaul, Jr., McCaul has English, Irish, and German ancestry. He graduated from Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas and earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from San Antonio&#x27;s Trinity University in 1984 and a Juris Doctor from St. Mary&#x27;s University three years later. McCaul also completed a Senior Executive Fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School.

McCaul worked as an attorney and federal prosecutor before entering politics. He was the Chief of Counterterrorism and National Security for Texas&#x27;s branch of the US Attorney&#x27;s office, and also worked under the Department of Justice&#x27;s Public Integrity Section. After he left, McCaul took a position as a Deputy Attorney General in 1999 with the Texas Attorney General&#x27;s Office and served in this capacity until 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
McCaul first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004 and won a crowded Republican primary in the newly created 10th District. The district, which included part of Austin, the western part of Harris County and several rural counties in between, was thought to be so heavily Republican that no Democratic candidate even filed, effectively handing him the seat.

In 2006 he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Ankrum and former Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik with 55% of the vote. McCaul was reelected again in 2008, against Democratic candidate Larry Joe Doherty and Libertarian candidate Matt Finkel, 54% to 43%.

Four years later, he was reelected to a fourth term with 76% of the vote against Ankrum (22%) and Libertarian candidate Jeremiah &quot;JP&quot; Perkins (1%). McCaul won a seventh term in 2016 with 179,221 votes (57.3%) to Democratic nominee Tawana W. Cadien&#x27;s 120,170 (38.4%). Libertarian Bill Kelsey received 13,209 (4.2%).

In 2018, McCaul won an eighth term in the House with 157,166 votes (51.1%) to Democratic nominee Mike Siegel&#x27;s 144,034 (46.8%) and Libertarian Mike Ryan&#x27;s 6,627 votes (2.5%). It was the closest race of McCaul&#x27;s career.

He was elected to a ninth term in 2020, defeating Siegel again.

===Political positions===

====Cybersecurity====

On December 11, 2013, McCaul introduced legislation to require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct cybersecurity activities on behalf of the federal government and codify DHS&#x27;s role in preventing and responding to cybersecurity incidents involving the information technology (IT) systems of federal civilian agencies and critical infrastructure in the U.S. McCaul said the bill was &quot;an important step toward addressing the cyber threat.&quot;

====Donald Trump====
On December 18, 2019, McCaul voted against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles. He also voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack encouraged by Trump&#x27;s false claims of electoral fraud. However, unlike Trump and most Republican legislators, McCaul did not sign the &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot; amicus brief to file a motion in support of the case. 

====Foreign affairs====
In April 2019, McCaul spoke out against a resolution that would end U.S. involvement in the Yemeni Civil War, saying it would &quot;disrupt US security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries.&quot;

In 2021, McCaul strongly supported President Joe Biden&#x27;s airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria.

McCaul said he supports heavily arming Ukraine with the weapons they need to win the Russo-Ukrainian War. He believes the United States should send fighter jets and more missiles to Ukraine. In February 2023, McCaul met the President of Ukraine in Kyiv and advocated for the United States to send more military aid to Ukraine, especially ATACMS.

In April 2023, during a meeting with Taiwanese officials, McCaul compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to Hitler.

On April 23, 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions over McCaul, alleging his frequent interference in China&#x27;s &quot;internal affairs.&quot; In 2024, McCaul was targeted by the Chinese government&#x27;s Spamouflage influence operation.

In November 2024, McCaul announced he was stepping down as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

====Immigration====

McCaul supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposals to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border. He supports the Remain in Mexico policy.

==== TikTok ====
Around the time of the introduction of Protecting Americans&#x27; Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries, the act including the TikTok ban, McCaul received attention for purchasing stock in Meta.

==== Taliban Funding ====
Shawn Ryan requested McCaul to introduce legislature ending the alleged funding of the Taliban by the U.S. government in 2024. Shawn Ryan later told Donald Trump in a interview that McCaul had &quot;done nothing&quot;.

=== Committee assignments ===

==Personal life==
McCaul is married to Linda Mays McCaul, the daughter of Clear Channel Communications founder and former chairman Lowry Mays and sister of its former CEO Mark Mays. In 2011, &quot;Roll Call&quot; named McCaul as one of the wealthiest members of the United States Congress, surpassing then U.S. senator John Kerry. His net worth was estimated at $294 million, up from $74 million the previous year. In 2004, the same publication estimated his net worth at $12 million. His wealth increase was due to large monetary transfers from his wife&#x27;s family.

McCaul and his family live in West Lake Hills, Texas, a wealthy suburb of Austin, Texas.

McCaul is a devout Catholic and is a noted critic of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega due to Ortega&#x27;s stance against the Catholic Church in Nicaragua.

On November 4, 2024, McCaul was charged with being drunk in public by Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority police. McCaul was briefly detained at Dulles International Airport, explaining to police he had drunk alcohol after taking Ambien. A family member arrived to drive him to his destination, and McCaul expressed gratitude for law enforcement, while emphasizing his commitment to learn from the mistake.

== Electoral history ==


















Incumbent Michael McCaul faced Assistant Attorney of Austin Mike Siegel in the 2018 general election, winning by 4.3 percent of the vote. This is the closest contest McCaul has faced. The outcome was notable in a district that political experts rated as &quot;Heavily Republican.&quot;



In the November 3, 2020 general election, incumbent Michael McCaul again defeated Austin Assistant Attorney Mike Siegel.

<text>Joshua Willis Alexander (January 22, 1852 – February 27, 1936) was United States secretary of commerce from December 16, 1919, to March 4, 1921, in the administration of President Woodrow Wilson.

==Biography==
Born on January 22, 1852, in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Thomas Willis Alexander and Jane (née Robinson). Alexander attended Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri, and later moved to Gallatin, Missouri, where he served as mayor and then as a state representative in the Missouri General Assembly (1883–1887). He served as a judge on Missouri&#x27;s 17th Circuit until 1905.

Alexander, a member of the United States Democratic Party, served as a United States representative from Missouri from 1907 until his resignation to become Commerce Secretary in 1919. He served as chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and took a lead role in shaping wartime shipping legislation, which drew him to the attention of President Wilson. He also gained prominence for his service as Chairman of the United States Commission to the international conference on the safety of life at sea in London in 1913.

After his tenure as Secretary of Commerce, Alexander returned to the practice of law in Missouri. He served as a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1922–23.

He died there on February 27, 1936, at the age of 84, eighteen years later, after retiring in Gallatin. Alexander was interred in Brown Cemetery in Gallatin.

Joshua W. Alexander was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter).

==Family==
Alexander married, the former Roe Ann Richardson (February 3, 1859 - March 18, 1940), the daughter of a judge, on February 3, 1876. The couple had eight children.

Alexander&#x27;s son, aviator Walter Alexander, was killed in a propeller accident at Bolling Field in 1920. Another son, George F. Alexander, became a federal judge in Juneau, Alaska.

<doc id="1132726" wikidata="Q2281298" url="?curid=1132726" title="Safety bicycle">
<text>A safety bicycle (or simply a safety) is a type of bicycle that became very popular beginning in the late 1880s as an alternative to the penny-farthing (also known as an &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;high wheeler&quot;) and is now the most common type of bicycle. Early bicycles of this style were known as safety bicycles because they were noted for, and marketed as, being safer than the high wheelers they were replacing. Even though modern bicycles use a similar design, the term is rarely used today and is considered obsolete outside circles familiar with high wheelers.

==Definition==
The term &#x27;safety bicycle&#x27; was used in the 1880s for any alternative to the penny-farthing. The front and rear wheel were not necessarily the same size. Later historians began to use the term in a more restricted way for the design that was a direct ancestor to most modern bicycles.

&quot;Diamond frame&quot; is also sometimes used as a term for safety bicycles, even though this technically only refers to a certain type of safety bicycle. The retronyms &quot;upright bicycle&quot; or &quot;vertical bicycle&quot; are used to distinguish the style from recumbent bicycles.

==History==

The first bicycle to be called a &quot;safety&quot; was designed by the English engineer Henry (&quot;Harry&quot;) Lawson in 1876, although other bicycles which fit the description had been developed earlier, such as by Thomas Humber in 1868. Unlike with penny-farthings, the rider&#x27;s feet were within reach of the ground, making it easier to stop. The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider&#x27;s feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson&#x27;s safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing. One other variation that appeared at about the same time is the dwarf, exemplified by the Kangaroo, and with a chain-driven front wheel.

By 1885, the safety bicycles cataloged in Henry Sturmey&#x27;s &quot;Indispensable Handbook to the Safety Bicycle&quot; included 7 with lever front-drives, 44 with geared front-drives, and only 9 with chain rear-drives. In that same year, John Kemp Starley (J. K. Starley) came out with the first commercially successful safety bicycle he named the Rover. The first modern bicycle, was heavier and more expensive than penny-farthings, but lighter and cheaper than tricycles of the day. In its original form it used indirect steering; later, direct steering was adopted and the bicycle proved to be a hit.

The Overman Wheel Company, founded 1882, was the first manufacturer of safety bicycles in the United States, in their factory complex in Chicopee, Massachusetts. Following their creation in England, Overman rushed a safety bicycle to production before the end of 1887. Overman was known for making all-steel bicycles with no cast metal parts. The Overman Victor bicycle was said to be of higher quality and lower weight than other bicycles of its time. By 1893, the Overman factory made the complete bicycle, including tyres, saddles, rims, etc.

In Brisbane, Queensland Australia, Engineer Reginald Blunt designed and built the first Queensland safety cycle which was used to race on instead of the penny-farthing.

The safety bicycle was a big improvement on the previous penny-farthing design which it replaced. The chain drive, coupling a large front sprocket (the chainring) to a small rear sprocket (the sprocket) to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, allowed for much smaller wheels, and replaced the need for the large, directly pedaled front wheel of the penny-farthing. The smaller wheel gave a harsher ride; once pneumatic tires were developed and replaced the previously used solid ones, this disadvantage was no longer an issue.

With the center of mass low and between the wheels, rather than high and over the front hub, the safety bicycle greatly diminished the danger of &quot;taking a header&quot; or long fall over the handlebars. This made braking more effective and cycling, previously the reserve of spry, daring young men, safer, and therefore much more popular, especially for women.

Compared with the tricycles of the time, popular with riders less willing to take risks, the safety bicycles were lighter, mechanically simpler, and less expensive.

Its popularity soon grew to be more than the penny-farthings and tricycles combined and caused the bike boom of the 1890s.

==Characteristics==
Safeties are now characterized by having two wheels of identicalor nearly identicalsize, and a chain-driven rear wheel. The most popular form of the safety bicycle frame, consisting of two triangles, is known as a &quot;diamond frame&quot;. A similar but different frame used in safety bicycles is the step-through frame.

Despite the enormous variety of modern bicycles, recumbent bicycles are the only major variety of bicycle which do not use this same basic design.

<text>Yvonne Catterfeld (born 2 December 1979) is a German singer, actress and television personality. Born and raised in Erfurt, Thuringia, she later moved to Leipzig to pursue her career in music. In 2000, she participated in the debut season of the singing competition series &quot;Stimme 2000&quot;, where she came in second place. Catterfeld subsequently signed a recording deal with Hansa Records, which released her debut single &quot;Bum&quot; in 2001. The same year, she was propelled to stardom when she was cast in a main role in the German soap opera &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot;. In 2003, Catterfeld made her musical breakthrough when her fifth single, &quot;Für dich&quot;, became an international number-one hit and produced the equally successful album &quot;Meine Welt&quot;.

Catterfeld continued booking success with follow-up albums &quot;Farben meiner Welt&quot; (2004) and &quot;Unterwegs&quot; (2005), which spawned the hit singles &quot;Du hast mein Herz gebrochen&quot; and &quot;Glaub an mich&quot;. Following her departure from &quot;GZSZ&quot; and a starring role in the short-living telenovela &quot;Sophie – Braut wider Willen&quot;, she released her fourth album &quot;Aura&quot;, which was less successful commercially and led to a decline in her musical career. She transitioned to Sony Music, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with the reissue of her sixth album &quot;Lieber so&quot; (2013), when she appeared in the second season of &quot;Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of the series &quot;The Best Singers&quot;.

Throughout a career spanning 15 years, Catterfeld has sold nearly one million records as a solo artist, making her one of the best-known German female music artists. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Bambi Award, a Goldene Stimmgabel, and an ECHO Award. An established actress, she has appeared in several international television and theatrical films, including &quot;Keinohrhasen&quot; (2007), &quot;The Promise&quot; (2011), and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (2014). In 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2024, she was a coach on the German television series &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot;.

Catterfeld was born and raised in Erfurt, Thuringia, then part of East Germany. Her father, Jürgen Catterfeld, is a foreman; her mother, Annemarie Catterfeld, is a teacher. A former athlete, Catterfeld started playing the piano and the flute at the age of 15, simultaneously taking her first dance and vocal lessons. After her high school graduation from Albert-Schweitzer-Gymnasium in Erfurt, she relocated to Leipzig to study pop and jazz at the Felix Mendelssohn College of Music and Theatre for two years. In 1998, her seven-song debut release, entitled &quot;KIV&quot;, hit the market but found little to no recognition in the music industry.

==Career==
===2000–2003===
After her studies in Leipzig, Catterfeld participated in the second season of the MDR singing competition series &quot;Stimme 2000&quot;, where she performed under her short-lived pseudonym &quot;Vivianne&quot;. Her self-written song &quot;Whenever You Need a Friend&quot; appeared on the show&#x27;s promotional album &quot;Stimme 2000 – Die Finalisten&quot;.
A critics&#x27; favorite, she finished second in the competition, losing to duo UC, consisting of singers Danny Heims and Kathrin Jantke, both of whom failed to sign a recording deal after the final show. Catterfeld, on the other hand, earned a management and recording contract with BMG sub-label Hansa Music by &quot;Stimme 2000&quot; jury member and label boss Thomas Stein.

In 2001, Hansa released Catterfeld&#x27;s first single &quot;Bum&quot;, a re-written German uptempo version of British girl group All Saints&#x27;s 1998 hit single &quot;Never Ever&quot;, promoting her under her surname only. The song failed to chart however. In support of her musical ambitions, she auditioned for a supporting role in the long-running RTL Television soap opera &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; the same year. Though generally unenthusiastic about an acting career at the time, Catterfeld accepted RTL&#x27;s offer to join the cast as character Julia Blum. She first appeared on-screen in episode 2316, broadcast on 20 September 2001. Two months later, her next single &quot;Komm zurück zu mir&quot;, a pop soul ballad, was released. A significant shift from the EDM-influenced sound of her debut single, it reached number 76 on the German Singles Chart. In 2002, Catterfeld was handpicked by musician Udo Lindenberg to appear on his 33rd album &quot;Atlantic Affairs&quot;. She recorded vocals for two songs on the album, which was later re-worked into a revue in which Catterfeld co-starred. Two further singles released by Catterfeld, &quot;Niemand sonst&quot; and &quot;Gefühle&quot;, both reached the top forty of the German Singles Chart in 2002.

In March 2003, &quot;Für dich&quot; was released. Composed by Dieter Bohlen and re-written for Catterfeld, the pop ballad was heavily promoted on &quot;GZSZ&quot;. Upon its release it became an instant success, reaching the top of charts in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. One of the best-selling singles of 2003, it sold 250,000 copies within three days and was certified platinum by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). In May 2003, Catterfeld&#x27;s debut album &quot;Meine Welt&quot; was released. A collection of pop songs and soul ballads with elements of contemporary R&amp;B and dance, it debuted on top of the German Albums Chart and reached the top five in Austria and Switzerland, eventually going platinum. In October 2003, Mariah Carey invited Catterfeld to be the opening act for the German leg of her Charmbracelet World Tour in Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich. Also in 2003, Catterfeld hosted the MDR singing competition &quot;Lucky Star 2003&quot;, and became a regular co-host on the music event series &quot;The Dome&quot;.

===2004–2008===
In 2004, Catterfeld voiced angelfish Angie in the German version of DreamWorks&#x27; animated comedy film &quot;Shark Tale&quot;. &quot;Du hast mein Herz gebrochen&quot;, the lead single from her second album, was released in January 2004 and became another number-one success for Catterfeld. Parent album &quot;Farben meiner Welt&quot;, was released two months later and reached the top ten on the charts. While not as commercially successful as its predecessor, it produced two further singles, both of which entered the top twenty and top thirty, respectively. After several breaks from filming, in late 2004, Catterfeld announced that she would permanently leave &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; to concentrate on her music career. Her last appearance was broadcast on 15 February 2005.

 In March 2005, &quot;Unterwegs&quot;, Catterfeld&#x27;s third album, was released. It debuted at number one the German Albums Chart and produced the top five single &quot;Glaub an mich&quot;. &quot;Unterwegs&quot; was later certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). Following its release, Catterfeld ended her management contract with longtime mentor Veronika Jarzombek. In November of the same year, she began starring as fictional central character Countess Sophie von Ahlen in the historical telenovela &quot;Sophie – Braut wider Willen&quot;. Broadcast to uneven ratings on Das Erste, the series was cancelled in March 2006 after 65 episodes only.

In October 2006, the singer released her fourth studio album, &quot;Aura&quot;. Mousse T., Walter Afanasieff, and Max Herre contributed to the project which took Catterfeld&#x27;s work further into the R&amp;B genre and introduced an adult contemporary edge to her pop sound. Upon its release, &quot;Aura&quot; debuted and peaked at number ten on the German Albums Chart, marking her lowest-charting album yet. While lead single &quot;Erinner mich, dich zu vergessen&quot; became her fourth top ten hit, the album&#x27;s second and final single &quot;Die Zeit ist reif&quot; failed to reach the upper half of the German Singles Chart. In November, Catterfeld filmed the RTL television film &quot;&quot;, a thriller inspired by English author Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;. The film was not released until 2008.

In 2007, she co-starred with Stephan Luca in the romantic comedy &quot;Wenn Liebe doch so einfach wär&quot;. The television film garnered strong ratings upon its premiere, but received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The same year, Catterfeld made a cameo appearance as herself in Til Schweiger&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit Without Ears&quot;, which became a surprise box-office hit and has since ranked among the most successful German films in Germany since the beginning of the audience census in 1968. In 2008, Catterfeld had a supporting role in comedy film &quot;U-900&quot;, a big screen parody of Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s epic war film &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981). The satire was universally panned by critics.

===2009–2013===
Catterfeld&#x27;s first project of 2009 was the police thriller &quot;Schatten der Gerechtigkeit&quot; co-starring Richy Müller. The film was well received by critics. &quot;&quot;, a two-part disaster film about volcanic caldera lake Laacher See, was broadcast to generally mixed reviews from critics. It was awarded a German Television Award the following year. &quot;Engel sucht Liebe&quot;, a Christmas comedy film, inspired by Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987), was broadcast to moderate ratings. Also in 2009, Catterfeld had a minor role in &quot;Lilly the Witch: The Dragon and the Magic Book&quot;, a children&#x27;s film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, and again played herself in Til Schweiger&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit Without Ears 2&quot;. Because of her resemblance to actress Romy Schneider, she had also been cast to play the title role in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Eine Frau wie Romy&quot;. The project was cancelled in July 2009.

 In March 2010, Catterfeld released her fifth album &quot;Blau im Blau&quot; on Columbia Records. Taking Catterfeld&#x27;s work further toward an adult audience, it was recorded with smaller group of musicians. A moderate commercial success, &quot;Blau im Blau&quot; reached number 37 on the German Albums Chart. Its same-title lead single, the only track lifted from the album, failed to peak within the top fifty of the German Singles Chart. Also in 2010, Catterfeld appeared in the Sat.1 television film &quot;Die Frau des Schläfers&quot;, in which she played a call centre operator, whose son is abducted by his Iran father. The drama was broadcast to strong ratings. Catterfeld portrayed a soap opera actress in Dani Levy&#x27;s comedy film &quot;&quot;, which received a theatrical release in late 2010. The project garnered largely mixed reviews by critics, who called it &quot;enjoyable and exhausting at once.&quot;

In 2011, the compilation album &quot;The Best of Yvonne Catterfeld – Von Anfang bis jetzt&quot; was released. The same year, Catterfeld had a role in the Channel 4 period mini series &quot;The Promise&quot;, written and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The serial praised by critics, and earned nominations for both the British Academy Television Awards 2011 and the Royal Television Society Programme Awards 2011 in the category of best drama serial. Also in 2011, she starred as Lotte Hass alongside Benjamin Sadler in the film &quot;&quot; about the first dive of Austrian biologist and diving pioneer Hans Hass in 1950. Broadcast in 2011 on ZDF and ORF, it became a rating success and earned Catterfeld favorable reviews for her performance. Catterfeld reunited with Stephan Luca for &quot;Am Ende die Hoffnung&quot; (2010), a romantic drama revolving around German submarine U-864 in World War II. Filmed in Berlin and Norway, the television film became a mediocre rating success for its network.

Catterfeld&#x27;s only project of 2012 was &quot;Plötzlich 70!&quot;. A fantasy comedy about a young woman who ages to retirement age overnight, the actress had to go through four hours of make-up each day to fit the character. Upon its broadcast, the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success. The following year, Catterfeld appeared in &quot;Sputnik&quot; (2013), a children&#x27;s film set days before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It received a positive reception from critics. She had bigger roles in the ZDF musical film &quot;Nur eine Nacht&quot; opposite Pasquale Aleardi and the ensemble disaster film &quot;&quot;. While the former became a critical and commercial flop, &quot;Heroes&quot; earned strong ratings though it was mostly panned by critics. In November 2013, Catterfeld&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Lieber so&quot; was released. It debuted at number twenty-one on the German Albums Chart, marking her sixth consecutive top forty entry.

===2014–present===
Catterfeld rejected the offer to appear in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot; (2013) to portray a princess in the Franco-German romantic film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; starring Léa Seydoux and Vincent Cassel. The film was screened out of competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, and released to positive reviews, becoming a box office success. It was nominated for the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best European Film at the 27th European Film Awards, and received three nominations at the 40th César Awards. Also in 2014, Catterfeld starred in the lead role of Amelia in the television films &quot;Zwischen Himmel und hier&quot; and &quot;Mein ganzes halbes Leben&quot;, which she had filmed back-to-back in Ireland the year before. Based on a treatment by Irish novelist Cecelia Ahern, the films were broadcast to strong ratings as part of ZDF&#x27;s &quot;Herzkino&quot; series. She also appeared in the film adaptation of Dora Heldt&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Sie haben gewonnen!&quot;, which became another commercial success, and had a minor role in the comedy film &quot;Bocksprünge&quot;.

In mid-2015, Catterfeld participated in the second season of the reality television series &quot;Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of the series &quot;The Best Singers&quot;. Her appearance on the show was accompanied by the re-release of &quot;Lieber so&quot;, which eventually surpassed its initial peak and reached number eight on the German Albums Chart, becoming her highest-charting album in a decade. Her rendition of Andreas Bourani&#x27;s song &quot;Hey&quot; reached the top twenty in Germany based on downloads alone and became highest-charting release in years. In August, Catterfeld represented Thuringia in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2015 with her single &quot;Lieber so&quot;, placing third in the contest with 114 points.

Catterfeld starred alongside Eliza Bennett, Rosemary Harris, and Matthew Macfadyen in the international co-production &quot;The von Trapp Family: A Life of Music&quot;, released in November 2015. A remake of the 1956 German film that in turn inspired the Broadway musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1959) and the 1965 film of the same name, she plays Maria von Trapp, the stepmother and matriarch of the Trapp Family Singers. Critics dismissed the film as &quot;clichéd heimatfilm&quot;. In 2016, Catterfeld appeared in the role of Nora Pilaster in the ZDF mini series &quot;A Dangerous Fortune&quot;, based on British author Ken Follett&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;A Dangerous Fortune&quot;. The same year, she began starring in the ARD police procedural television series &quot;Wolfsland&quot; opposite Götz Schubert, and served as a coach on the sixth season of the television series &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot;. In 2017, Catterfeld released her seventh album &quot;Guten Morgen Freiheit&quot;. Her highest-charting album since &quot;Unterwegs&quot; (2005), it debuted at number four on the Austrian and German Albums Chart, respectively, and peaked at number seven in Switzerland. In 2019, after three season with the show, Catterfeld announced her departure from &quot;The Voice&quot;.

==Personal life==

From 2004 to 2007 Catterfeld had a relationship with actor Wayne Carpendale. In late 2007, she started dating author and actor Oliver Wnuk, after having met on the set of their film &quot;U-900&quot;. Their son, Charlie, was born on 19 April 2014.
They filed for divorce in 2021.

Tokio Marine Holdings was formerly known as Millea Group, which underwent a name change in July 2008. Its headquarters are in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

The company is one of the very few groups and individuals that still use the spelling Tokio for the city in the English language.

<text>Animal style art is an approach to decoration found from Ordos culture to Northern Europe in the early Iron Age, and the barbarian art of the Migration Period, characterized by its emphasis on animal motifs. The zoomorphic style of decoration was used to decorate small objects by warrior-herdsmen, whose economy was based on breeding and herding animals, supplemented by trade and plunder. Animal art is a more general term for all art depicting animals.

==Eastern styles==

Scythian art makes great use of animal motifs, one component of the &quot;Scythian triad&quot; of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild animal art. The cultures referred to as Scythian-style included the Cimmerian and Sarmatian cultures in European Sarmatia and stretched across the Eurasian steppe north of the Near East to the Ordos culture of Inner Mongolia. These cultures were extremely influential in spreading many local versions of the style.

Steppe jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles bunched tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The &quot;looped&quot; antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the reindeer, which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period. The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing. The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan totem. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the Arzhan kurgan, Tuva, Siberia, with animal style artifacts (8-7th century BC).
*the burial site of Kostromskaya in the Kuban dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*Tápiószentmárton in Hungary dating from the 5th century BC, now National Museum of Hungary, Budapest
*Kul Oba in the Crimea dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).

Another characteristic form is the openwork plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.
The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess and powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

A distinct Permian style of bronze or copper alloy objects from around the 5th–10th centuries AD are found near the Ural Mountains and the Volga and Kama rivers in Russia.

==Germanic animal style==

The study of Germanic zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by Bernhard Salin in a work published in 1904. Salin classified animal art from roughly 400 to 900 AD into three phases. The origins of these different phases remain the subject of debate; developing trends in late-Roman popular provincial art was an element, as were earlier traditions of the nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples. Styles I and II are found widely across Europe in the art of the &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples during the Migration Period.

Style I. First appearing in northwest Europe, first expressed with the introduction of the chip carving technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.

Style II. After about 560–570 Style I, declining, began to be supplanted. The animals of Style II are whole beasts, their bodies elongated into &quot;ribbons&quot; which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretense of naturalism—rarely with legs—tending to be described as serpents, though heads often have characteristics of other animals. The animals become subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically interlace. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid (picture) from Sutton Hoo (c. 625). Eventually about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style. 

Salin Style III is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called Viking art. Interlace, where it occurs, becomes less regular and more complex, and if not three-dimensional animals are usually seen in profile but twisted, exaggerated, surreal, with fragmented body parts filling every available space, creating an intense detailed energetic feel. Animals&#x27; bodies become hard for the unpractised viewer to read, and there is a very common motif of the &quot;gripping beast&quot; where an animal&#x27;s mouth grips onto another element of the composition to connect two parts. Animal style was one component, along with Celtic art and late classical elements, in the formation of style of Insular art and Anglo-Saxon art in the British Isles, and through these routes and others on the Continent, left a considerable legacy in later Medieval art.

Other names are sometimes used: in Anglo-Saxon art Kendrick preferred &quot;Helmet&quot; and &quot;Ribbon&quot; for Styles I and II.

<doc id="1132741" wikidata="Q57178" url="?curid=1132741" title="Eugen d'Albert">
<text>Eugen (originally Eugène) Francis Charles d&#x27;Albert (10 April 1864 – 3 March 1932) was a Scottish-born pianist and composer who emigrated to Germany. 

Educated in Britain, d&#x27;Albert showed early musical talent and, at the age of seventeen, he won a scholarship to study in Austria. Feeling a kinship with German culture and music, he soon emigrated to Germany, where he studied with Franz Liszt and began a career as a concert pianist. D&#x27;Albert repudiated his early training and upbringing in Scotland and considered himself German.

While pursuing his career as a pianist, d&#x27;Albert focused increasingly on composing, producing 21 operas and a considerable output of piano, vocal, chamber and orchestral works. His most successful opera was &quot;Tiefland&quot;, which premiered in Prague in 1903. His successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. In 1907 d&#x27;Albert became the director of the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, where he exerted a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He edited critical editions of the scores of Beethoven and Bach, transcribed Bach&#x27;s organ works for the piano and wrote cadenzas for Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos. He also held the post of Kapellmeister to the Court of Weimar.

D&#x27;Albert was married six times, including to the pianist-singer Teresa Carreño, and was successively a British, German and Swiss citizen. His first son was Louis-Albert Salingré.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

D&#x27;Albert was born at 4 Crescent Place, Glasgow, Scotland, to an English mother, Annie Rowell, and a German-born father of French and Italian descent, Charles Louis Napoléon d&#x27;Albert (1809–1886), whose ancestors included the composers Giuseppe Matteo Alberti and Domenico Alberti. D&#x27;Albert&#x27;s father was a pianist, arranger and a prolific composer of salon music who had been ballet-master at the King&#x27;s Theatre and at Covent Garden. D&#x27;Albert was born when his father was 55 years old. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote in 1904 that &quot;This, and other circumstances, accounted for a certain loneliness in the boy&#x27;s home-life and the years of his childhood. He was misunderstood, and &#x27;cribbed, cabined, and confined&#x27; to such an extent as to largely prejudice him against the country which gave him birth&quot;.

D&#x27;Albert was brought up in Glasgow and taught music by his father until he won a scholarship to the new National Training School for Music (forerunner of the Royal College of Music) in London, which he entered in 1876 at the age of 12. D&#x27;Albert studied at the National Training School with Ernst Pauer, Ebenezer Prout, John Stainer and Arthur Sullivan. By the age of 14, he was winning public praise from &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a bravura player of no mean order&quot; in a concert in October 1878. He played Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto at the Crystal Palace in 1880, receiving more encouragement from &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;A finer rendering of the work has seldom been heard.&quot; Also in 1880, d&#x27;Albert arranged the piano reduction for the vocal score of Sullivan&#x27;s sacred music drama &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot;, to accompany the chorus in rehearsal. He is also credited with writing, under Sullivan&#x27;s direction, the overture to Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1881 opera, &quot;Patience&quot;.

For many years d&#x27;Albert dismissed his training and work during this period as worthless. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that he &quot;was born and educated in England, and won his earliest successes in England, although, in a freak of boyish impetuosity, he repudiated some years ago all connexion with this country, where, according to his own account, he was born by mere accident and where he learnt nothing.&quot; In later years, however, he modified his views: &quot;The former prejudice which I had against England, which several incidents aroused, has completely vanished since many years.&quot;

===Career===

In 1881 Hans Richter invited d&#x27;Albert to play his first piano concerto, which was &quot;received with enthusiasm&quot;. This seems to have been d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s lost concerto in A major, not the work published three years later as his Piano Concerto No. 1 in B minor, Op. 2. In the same year d&#x27;Albert won the Mendelssohn Scholarship, enabling him to study in Vienna, where he met Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt and other important musicians who influenced his style. D&#x27;Albert, retaining his early enthusiasm for German culture and music (&quot;hearing &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; had a greater influence on him than the education he received from his father or ... at the National Training School for Music&quot;) changed his first name from Eugène to Eugen and emigrated to Germany, where he became a pupil of the elderly Liszt in Weimar.
In Germany and Austria d&#x27;Albert built a career as a pianist. Liszt called him &quot;the second Tausig&quot;, and d&#x27;Albert can be heard in an early recording of Liszt works. He played his own piano concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1882, the youngest pianist who had appeared with the orchestra. D&#x27;Albert toured extensively, including in the United States from 1904 to 1905. His virtuoso technique was compared to that of Busoni. He was praised for his playing of Beethoven&#x27;s sonatas and J. S. Bach&#x27;s preludes and fugues, some of which d&#x27;Albert transcribed for piano. &quot;As an exponent of Beethoven, Eugen d&#x27;Albert has few, if any, equals.&quot; Gradually, d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s work as a composer occupied his time more and more, and he reduced his concert playing. He was the recipient of a number of dedications, most notably of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Burleske in D minor&quot;, which he premiered in 1890. In 1907 he became the director of the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, where, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, he exerted a wide influence on musical education in Germany. He also held the post of Kapellmeister to the Court of Weimar.

D&#x27;Albert was a prolific composer. His output includes a large volume of successful piano and chamber music and lieder. He also composed twenty-one operas, in a wide variety of styles, which premiered mostly in Germany. His first, &quot;Der Rubin&quot; (1893) was an oriental fantasy; &quot;Die Abreise&quot; (1898), which established him as an opera composer in Germany, was a one-act domestic comedy; &quot;Kain&quot; (1900) was a setting of the biblical story; and one of his last operas, &quot;Der Golem&quot;, was on a traditional Jewish theme. His most successful opera was his seventh, &quot;Tiefland&quot;, which premiered in Prague in 1903. When Thomas Beecham introduced the opera to London, &quot;The Times&quot; observed, &quot;the scoring owes more than a little to the discipline of Sullivan; there is also a curiously English fragrance&quot;. &quot;Tiefland&quot; played in opera houses throughout the world and has retained a place in the standard German and Austrian repertoire, with a production at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, in November 2007. According to biographer Hugh Macdonald, it &quot;provides a link between Italian verismo and German expressionist opera, although the orchestral textures recall a more Wagnerian language.&quot; Another stage success was a comic opera called &quot;Flauto solo&quot; in 1905. D&#x27;Albert&#x27;s most successful orchestral works included his cello concerto (1899), a symphony, two string quartets and two piano concertos. &quot;Though not a composer of profound originality ... he had an unfailing sense of dramatic appropriateness and all the resources of a symphonic technique to give it expression and was thus able to achieve success in so many styles&quot;.
===Personal life and death===

D&#x27;Albert&#x27;s friends included Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Engelbert Humperdinck, Ignatz Waghalter and Gerhart Hauptmann, the dramatist. He was married six times and had eight children. His first wife was Louise Salingré; their first son was Louis-Albert Salingré. His second wife, from 1892 to 1895, was the Venezuelan pianist, singer and composer Teresa Carreño, who had married several times and was considerably older than d&#x27;Albert. D&#x27;Albert and Carreño were the subject of a famous joke: &quot;Come quick! Your children and my children are quarrelling again with our children!&quot; The line, however, has also been attributed to others. His later wives were soprano Hermine Finck, who originated the role of the witch in Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;; actress Ida Fulda; Friederike (&quot;Fritzi&quot;) Jauner; and Hilde Fels. His last companion was a mistress, Virginia Zanetti.

In 1914 d&#x27;Albert moved to Zurich and became a Swiss citizen. He died in 1932 at the age of 67 in Riga, Latvia, where he had travelled for a divorce from his sixth wife. In the weeks preceding his death, d&#x27;Albert was the subject of attacks by the press in Riga concerning his personal life. D&#x27;Albert was buried in the cemetery overlooking Lake Lugano in Morcote, Switzerland.

As pianist, d&#x27;Albert did not record extensively, although his recordings represent a wide range of music. They include his own Scherzo, Op. 16; Capriolen, Op. 32; Suite, Op. 1, Gavotte and Minuet; and piano arrangements from his opera &quot;Die Toten Augen&quot;.

A selection of Chopin pieces were recorded in the 1910s and 1920s, with études, polonaises and waltzes represented. Perhaps surprisingly, his teacher Liszt is not strongly represented among d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s recordings, though he committed &quot;Au bord d&#x27;une source&quot; from &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; (1st year) to disc in 1916. Brahms, Mozart, Schubert and Weber also feature in his discography.

<doc id="1132752" wikidata="Q683162" url="?curid=1132752" title="Durnovaria">
<text>Durnovaria is a suggested spelling for the Latin form of the name of the Roman town of Dorchester in the modern English county of Dorset, amended from the actually observed Durnonovaria. Upon the assumption that the name was originally Brythonic, it is suggested that the first element in the name, &quot;*durno-&quot; may mean &quot;fist&quot; like (Welsh &quot;dwrn&quot; ‘fist, knob’) and the second may be related to Old Irish &quot;fáir ~ fóir&quot; denoting a confined area or den. A simpler amendment (one letter instead of two) would lead to *Duronovaria, making this place one of up to 18 ancient British names that contain Duro- and mostly occur at river crossings, while -novaria has two possible ancient parallels in Britain associated with river junctions. That analysis would perfectly fit the geographical situation of Dorchester.

==Romans at Maiden Castle==
The pre-Roman population centre in the area appears to have been at the hill fort of Maiden Castle, southwest of the town centre. The inhabitants appear to have resisted the Roman invasion and their war cemetery was excavated in the 1930s by Mortimer Wheeler. It later became the site of a 4th-century Romano-British temple.

==Roman Dorchester==

The site of present-day Dorchester may have originally been a small garrison fort for the Legio II Augusta established shortly after the Roman conquest on the site of Greyhound Yard. When the military moved away, around AD 65–70, Durnovaria became a civilian settlement, apparently the &quot;civitas Durotrigum&quot; of the tribal confederacy of the Durotriges. Shafts were dug to deposit ritual foundation items. An organised street plan was laid out, ignoring earlier boundaries, the streets lined with timber-slot structures; public buildings including &quot;thermae&quot; were erected and an artificial water supply established. The town seems to have become one of twin capitals for the local Durotriges tribe. 

It was an important local market centre, particularly for Purbeck marble, shale and the pottery industries from Poole Harbour and the New Forest. The town remained small, around the central and southern areas of the present settlement, until expansion to the north-west, around Colliton Park, in the 2nd century. By the middle of this century, the town defences were added and Maumbury Rings, a neolithic henge monument, was converted for use as an amphitheatre. 

The third century saw the first replacement of timber buildings with stone ones, an unexpectedly late development in an area with several good sources of building stone. There were many fine homes for rich families and their excavated mosaic floors suggest a mosaic school of art had a workshop in the town, members of which seem to have travelled in the area to execute mosaic floors in villas away from Durnovaria itself. A large late-Roman and Christian cemetery has been excavated at Poundbury just to the west of the town, but little is known of Durnovaria&#x27;s decline after the departure of the Roman administration. The name, however, survived to become the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Dornwaraceaster&quot; and modern &#x27;Dorchester&#x27;. The residents of modern day Dorchester are known as Durnovarians.

==Extant remains==
The town still has some Roman features, including part of the town walls and the foundations of a Roman town house, which are freely accessible near County Hall. There are many Roman finds in the County Museum. The Romans built an aqueduct to supply the town with water, traces remain at nearby Whitfield Farm and approaching Poundbury tunnel on the Dorchester - Yeovil railway. Near the town centre is Maumbury Rings, an ancient British earthwork converted by the Romans for use as an amphitheatre, and to the north west is Poundbury Hill, another pre-Roman fortification.

Part of a Roman road, known today as High West Street, exists underneath the Dorset Museum, and a portion of it is displayed within the museum. The road ran through the centre of Durnovaria.

There is little evidence to show whether or not Durnovaria survived into the post-Roman era: Gildas&#x27; record of a tradition, given in &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; iii, of twenty-eight cities and sundry castles of former happy times was not provided with any names. Surviving northern boundaries of the administrative region, or &quot;civitas&quot; that included Dorset, reached as far as Selwood, and mark the county division between Somerset and Wiltshire to this day. In the sub-Roman period, as urban centres were progressively abandoned, the centres of administration and justice, such as they were, generally removed to fortified strongholds. The city&#x27;s site is attested as &quot;Dornwaraceaster&quot; in the ninth century, elided to produce Dornaceaster&quot;, first recorded in 937.

<doc id="1132756" wikidata="Q925958" url="?curid=1132756" title="Animal locomotion">
<text>In ethology, animal locomotion is any of a variety of methods that animals use to move from one place to another. Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called passive locomotion, e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), kiting (spiders), rolling (some beetles and spiders) or riding other animals (phoresis).

Animals move for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a suitable microhabitat, or to escape predators. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the Arctic tern) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion.

The anatomical structures that animals use for movement, including cilia, legs, wings, arms, fins, or tails are sometimes referred to as &quot;locomotory organs&quot; or &quot;locomotory structures&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;locomotion&quot; is formed in English from Latin &quot;loco&quot; &quot;from a place&quot; (ablative of &quot;locus&quot; &quot;place&quot;) + &quot;motio&quot; &quot;motion, a moving&quot;.
The movement of whole body is called locomotion

==Aquatic==
===Swimming===
In water, staying afloat is possible using buoyancy. If an animal&#x27;s body is less dense than water, it can stay afloat. This requires little energy to maintain a vertical position, but requires more energy for locomotion in the horizontal plane compared to less buoyant animals. The drag encountered in water is much greater than in air. Morphology is therefore important for efficient locomotion, which is in most cases essential for basic functions such as catching prey. A fusiform, torpedo-like body form is seen in many aquatic animals, though the mechanisms they use for locomotion are diverse.

The primary means by which fish generate thrust is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large tail fin. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from pectoral fins (or front limbs in marine mammals). Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (&quot;Hydrolagus colliei&quot;) and batiform fish (electric rays, sawfishes, guitarfishes, skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed labriform swimming. Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.
Other animals, e.g. penguins, diving ducks, move underwater in a manner which has been termed &quot;aquatic flying&quot;. Some fish propel themselves without a wave motion of the body, as in the slow-moving seahorses and &quot;Gymnotus&quot;.

Other animals, such as cephalopods, use jet propulsion to travel fast, taking in water then squirting it back out in an explosive burst. Other swimming animals may rely predominantly on their limbs, much as humans do when swimming. Though life on land originated from the seas, terrestrial animals have returned to an aquatic lifestyle on several occasions, such as the fully aquatic cetaceans, now very distinct from their terrestrial ancestors.

Dolphins sometimes ride on the bow waves created by boats or surf on naturally breaking waves.

===Benthic===
Benthic locomotion is movement by animals that live on, in, or near the bottom of aquatic environments. In the sea, many animals walk over the seabed. Echinoderms primarily use their tube feet to move about. The tube feet typically have a tip shaped like a suction pad that can create a vacuum through contraction of muscles. This, along with some stickiness from the secretion of mucus, provides adhesion. Waves of tube feet contractions and relaxations move along the adherent surface and the animal moves slowly along. Some sea urchins also use their spines for benthic locomotion.

Crabs typically walk sideways (a behaviour that gives us the word ). This is because of the articulation of the legs, which makes a sidelong gait more efficient. However, some crabs walk forwards or backwards, including raninids, &quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; and &quot;Mictyris platycheles&quot;. Some crabs, notably the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming, the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.

A stomatopod, &quot;Nannosquilla decemspinosa&quot;, can escape by rolling itself into a self-propelled wheel and somersault backwards at a speed of 72 rpm. They can travel more than 2 m using this unusual method of locomotion.

==Aquatic surface==

&quot;Velella&quot;, the by-the-wind sailor, is a cnidarian with no means of propulsion other than sailing. A small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. &quot;Velella&quot; sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind.

While larger animals such as ducks can move on water by floating, some small animals move across it without breaking through the surface. This surface locomotion takes advantage of the surface tension of water. Animals that move in such a way include the water strider. Water striders have legs that are hydrophobic, preventing them from interfering with the structure of water. Another form of locomotion (in which the surface layer is broken) is used by the basilisk lizard.

==Aerial==
===Active flight===

Gravity is the primary obstacle to flight. Because it is impossible for any organism to have a density as low as that of air, flying animals must generate enough lift to ascend and remain airborne. One way to achieve this is with wings, which when moved through the air generate an upward lift force on the animal&#x27;s body. Flying animals must be very light to achieve flight, the largest living flying animals being birds of around 20 kilograms. Other structural adaptations of flying animals include reduced and redistributed body weight, fusiform shape and powerful flight muscles; there may also be physiological adaptations. Active flight has independently evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Insects were the first taxon to evolve flight, approximately 400 million years ago (mya), followed by pterosaurs approximately 220 mya, birds approximately 160 mya, then bats about 60 mya.

===Gliding===
Rather than active flight, some (semi-) arboreal animals reduce their rate of falling by gliding. Gliding is heavier-than-air flight without the use of thrust; the term &quot;volplaning&quot; also refers to this mode of flight in animals. This mode of flight involves flying a greater distance horizontally than vertically and therefore can be distinguished from a simple descent like a parachute. Gliding has evolved on more occasions than active flight. There are examples of gliding animals in several major taxonomic classes such as the invertebrates (e.g., gliding ants), reptiles (e.g., banded flying snake), amphibians (e.g., flying frog), mammals (e.g., sugar glider, squirrel glider).

Some aquatic animals also regularly use gliding, for example, flying fish, octopus and squid. The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 meters (160 ft), though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to . To glide upward out of the water, a flying fish moves its tail up to 70 times per second.
Several oceanic squid, such as the Pacific flying squid, leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of flying fish. Smaller squids fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as 50 m. Small fins towards the back of the mantle help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet-propelled aerial locomotion. The neon flying squid has been observed to glide for distances over , at speeds of up to .

===Soaring===
Soaring birds can maintain flight without wing flapping, using rising air currents. Many gliding birds are able to &quot;lock&quot; their extended wings by means of a specialized tendon. Soaring birds may alternate glides with periods of soaring in rising air. Five principal types of lift are used: thermals, ridge lift, lee waves, convergences and dynamic soaring.

Examples of soaring flight by birds are the use of:
*Thermals and convergences by raptors such as vultures
*Ridge lift by gulls near cliffs
*Wave lift by migrating birds 
*Dynamic effects near the surface of the sea by albatrosses

===Ballooning===
Ballooning is a method of locomotion used by spiders. Certain silk-producing arthropods, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight gossamer silk for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude.

==Terrestrial==


Forms of locomotion on land include walking, running, hopping or jumping, dragging and crawling or slithering. Here friction and buoyancy are no longer an issue, but a strong skeletal and muscular framework are required in most terrestrial animals for structural support. Each step also requires much energy to overcome inertia, and animals can store elastic potential energy in their tendons to help overcome this. Balance is also required for movement on land. Human infants learn to crawl first before they are able to stand on two feet, which requires good coordination as well as physical development. Humans are bipedal animals, standing on two feet and keeping one on the ground at all times while walking. When running, only one foot is on the ground at any one time at most, and both leave the ground briefly. At higher speeds momentum helps keep the body upright, so more energy can be used in movement.

===Jumping===


Jumping (saltation) can be distinguished from running, galloping, and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. Many terrestrial animals use jumping (including hopping or leaping) to escape predators or catch prey—however, relatively few animals use this as a primary mode of locomotion. Those that do include the kangaroo and other macropods, rabbit, hare, jerboa, hopping mouse, and kangaroo rat. Kangaroo rats often leap 2 m and reportedly up to 2.75 m at speeds up to almost . They can quickly change their direction between jumps. The rapid locomotion of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat may minimize energy cost and predation risk. Its use of a &quot;move-freeze&quot; mode may also make it less conspicuous to nocturnal predators. Frogs are, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates. The Australian rocket frog, &quot;Litoria nasuta&quot;, can leap over , more than fifty times its body length.


===Peristalsis and looping===
Other animals move in terrestrial habitats without the aid of legs. Earthworms crawl by a peristalsis, the same rhythmic contractions that propel food through the digestive tract.

Leeches and geometer moth caterpillars move by looping or inching (measuring off a length with each movement), using their paired circular and longitudinal muscles (as for peristalsis) along with the ability to attach to a surface at both anterior and posterior ends. One end is attached, often the thicker end, and the other end, often thinner, is projected forward peristaltically until it touches down, as far as it can reach; then the first end is released, pulled forward, and reattached; and the cycle repeats. In the case of leeches, attachment is by a sucker at each end of the body.

===Sliding===
Due to its low coefficient of friction, ice provides the opportunity for other modes of locomotion. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called &quot;tobogganing&quot;, which conserves energy while moving quickly. Some pinnipeds perform a similar behaviour called &quot;sledding&quot;.

===Climbing===
Some animals are specialized for moving on non-horizontal surfaces. One common habitat for such climbing animals is in trees; for example, the gibbon is specialized for arboreal movement, travelling rapidly by brachiation (see below).

Others living on rock faces such as in mountains move on steep or even near-vertical surfaces by careful balancing and leaping. Perhaps the most exceptional are the various types of mountain-dwelling caprids (e.g., Barbary sheep, yak, ibex, rocky mountain goat, etc.), whose adaptations can include a soft rubbery pad between their hooves for grip, hooves with sharp keratin rims for lodging in small footholds, and prominent dew claws. Another case is the snow leopard, which being a predator of such caprids also has spectacular balance and leaping abilities, such as ability to leap up to 17m (50ft).

Some light animals are able to climb up smooth sheer surfaces or hang upside down by adhesion using suckers. Many insects can do this, though much larger animals such as geckos can also perform similar feats.

===Walking and running===
Species have different numbers of legs resulting in large differences in locomotion.
Modern birds, though classified as tetrapods, usually have only two functional legs, which some (e.g., ostrich, emu, kiwi) use as their primary, Bipedal, mode of locomotion. A few modern mammalian species are habitual bipeds, i.e., whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. These include the macropods, kangaroo rats and mice, springhare, hopping mice, pangolins and homininan apes. Bipedalism is rarely found outside terrestrial animals—though at least two types of octopus walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, so they can use the remaining arms to camouflage themselves as a mat of algae or floating coconut.

There are no three-legged animals—though some macropods, such as kangaroos, that alternate between resting their weight on their muscular tails and their two hind legs could be looked at as an example of tripedal locomotion in animals.

Many familiar animals are quadrupedal, walking or running on four legs. A few birds use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances. For example, the shoebill sometimes uses its wings to right itself after lunging at prey. The newly hatched hoatzin bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings are strong enough for sustained flight. These claws are gone by the time the bird reaches adulthood.

A relatively few animals use five limbs for locomotion. Prehensile quadrupeds may use their tail to assist in locomotion and when grazing, the kangaroos and other macropods use their tail to propel themselves forward with the four legs used to maintain balance.

Insects generally walk with six legs—though some insects such as nymphalid butterflies do not use the front legs for walking.

Arachnids have eight legs. Most arachnids lack extensor muscles in the distal joints of their appendages. Spiders and whipscorpions extend their limbs hydraulically using the pressure of their hemolymph. Solifuges and some harvestmen extend their knees by the use of highly elastic thickenings in the joint cuticle. Scorpions, pseudoscorpions and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once.

The scorpion &quot;Hadrurus arizonensis&quot; walks by using two groups of legs (left 1, right 2, Left 3, Right 4 and Right 1, Left 2, Right 3, Left 4) in a reciprocating fashion. This alternating tetrapod coordination is used over all walking speeds.

Centipedes and millipedes have many sets of legs that move in metachronal rhythm. Some echinoderms locomote using the many tube feet on the underside of their arms. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction. Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some multi-armed, fast-moving starfish such as the sunflower seastar (&quot;Pycnopodia helianthoides&quot;) pull themselves along with some of their arms while letting others trail behind. Other starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving, which exposes the sensory tube feet and eyespot to external stimuli. Most starfish cannot move quickly, a typical speed being that of the leather star (&quot;Dermasterias imbricata&quot;), which can manage just in a minute. Some burrowing species from the genera &quot;Astropecten&quot; and &quot;Luidia&quot; have points rather than suckers on their long tube feet and are capable of much more rapid motion, &quot;gliding&quot; across the ocean floor. The sand star (&quot;Luidia foliolata&quot;) can travel at a speed of per minute. Sunflower starfish are quick, efficient hunters, moving at a speed of using 15,000 tube feet.

Many animals temporarily change the number of legs they use for locomotion in different circumstances. For example, many quadrupedal animals switch to bipedalism to reach low-level browse on trees. The genus of &quot;Basiliscus&quot; are arboreal lizards that usually use quadrupedalism in the trees. When frightened, they can drop to water below and run across the surface on their hind limbs at about 1.5 m/s for a distance of approximately before they sink to all fours and swim. They can also sustain themselves on all fours while &quot;water-walking&quot; to increase the distance travelled above the surface by about 1.3 m. When cockroaches run rapidly, they rear up on their two hind legs like bipedal humans; this allows them to run at speeds up to 50 body lengths per second, equivalent to a &quot;couple hundred miles per hour, if you scale up to the size of humans.&quot; When grazing, kangaroos use a form of pentapedalism (four legs plus the tail) but switch to hopping (bipedalism) when they wish to move at a greater speed.

===Powered cartwheeling===
The Moroccan flic-flac spider (&quot;Cebrennus rechenbergi&quot;) uses a series of rapid, acrobatic flic-flac movements of its legs similar to those used by gymnasts, to actively propel itself off the ground, allowing it to move both down and uphill, even at a 40 percent incline. This behaviour is different than other huntsman spiders, such as &quot;Carparachne aureoflava&quot; from the Namib Desert, which uses passive cartwheeling as a form of locomotion. The flic-flac spider can reach speeds of up to 2 m/s using forward or back flips to evade threats.

==Subterranean==
Some animals move through solids such as soil by burrowing using peristalsis, as in earthworms, or other methods. In loose solids such as sand some animals, such as the golden mole, marsupial mole, and the pink fairy armadillo, are able to move more rapidly, &quot;swimming&quot; through the loose substrate. Burrowing animals include moles, ground squirrels, naked mole-rats, tilefish, and mole crickets.

==Arboreal locomotion==
Arboreal locomotion is the locomotion of animals in trees. Some animals may only scale trees occasionally, while others are exclusively arboreal. These habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them, leading to a variety of anatomical, behavioural and ecological consequences as well as variations throughout different species. Furthermore, many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or mountains. The earliest known tetrapod with specializations that adapted it for climbing trees was &quot;Suminia&quot;, a synapsid of the late Permian, about 260 million years ago. Some invertebrate animals are exclusively arboreal in habitat, for example, the tree snail.

Brachiation (from &quot;brachium&quot;, Latin for &quot;arm&quot;) is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Some New World monkeys such as spider monkeys and muriquis are &quot;semibrachiators&quot; and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand.

Pandas are known to swig their heads laterally as they ascend vertical surfaces astonishingly utilizing their head as a propulsive limb in an anatomical way that was thought to only be practiced by certain species of birds.

== Energetics ==
Animal locomotion requires energy to overcome various forces including friction, drag, inertia and gravity, although the influence of these depends on the circumstances. In terrestrial environments, gravity must be overcome whereas the drag of air has little influence. In aqueous environments, friction (or drag) becomes the major energetic challenge with gravity being less of an influence. Remaining in the aqueous environment, animals with natural buoyancy expend little energy to maintain a vertical position in a water column. Others naturally sink, and must spend energy to remain afloat. Drag is also an energetic influence in flight, and the aerodynamically efficient body shapes of flying birds indicate how they have evolved to cope with this. Limbless organisms moving on land must energetically overcome surface friction, however, they do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity.

Newton&#x27;s third law of motion is widely used in the study of animal locomotion: if at rest, to move forwards an animal must push something backwards. Terrestrial animals must push the solid ground, swimming and flying animals must push against a fluid (either water or air). The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement. The energetics of locomotion involves the energy expenditure by animals in moving. Energy consumed in locomotion is not available for other efforts, so animals typically have evolved to use the minimum energy possible during movement. However, in the case of certain behaviors, such as locomotion to escape a predator, performance (such as speed or maneuverability) is more crucial, and such movements may be energetically expensive. Furthermore, animals may use energetically expensive methods of locomotion when environmental conditions (such as being within a burrow) preclude other modes.

The most common metric of energy use during locomotion is the net (also termed &quot;incremental&quot;) cost of transport, defined as the amount of energy (e.g., Joules) needed above baseline metabolic rate to move a given distance. For aerobic locomotion, most animals have a nearly constant cost of transport—moving a given distance requires the same caloric expenditure, regardless of speed. This constancy is usually accomplished by changes in gait. The net cost of transport of swimming is lowest, followed by flight, with terrestrial limbed locomotion being the most expensive per unit distance. However, because of the speeds involved, flight requires the most energy per unit time. This does not mean that an animal that normally moves by running would be a more efficient swimmer; however, these comparisons assume an animal is specialized for that form of motion. Another consideration here is body mass—heavier animals, though using more total energy, require less energy &quot;per unit mass&quot; to move. Physiologists generally measure energy use by the amount of oxygen consumed, or the amount of carbon dioxide produced, in an animal&#x27;s respiration. In terrestrial animals, the cost of transport is typically measured while they walk or run on a motorized treadmill, either wearing a mask to capture gas exchange or with the entire treadmill enclosed in a metabolic chamber. For small rodents, such as deer mice, the cost of transport has also been measured during voluntary wheel running.

Energetics is important for explaining the evolution of foraging economic decisions in organisms; for example, a study of the African honey bee, &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;, has shown that honey bees may trade the high sucrose content of viscous nectar off for the energetic benefits of warmer, less concentrated nectar, which also reduces their consumption and flight time.

==Passive locomotion==
Passive locomotion in animals is a type of mobility in which the animal depends on their environment for transportation; such animals are vagile but not motile.

===Hydrozoans===

The Portuguese man o&#x27; war (&quot;Physalia physalis&quot;) lives at the surface of the ocean. The gas-filled bladder, or pneumatophore (sometimes called a &quot;sail&quot;), remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. Because the Portuguese man o&#x27; war has no means of propulsion, it is moved by a combination of winds, currents, and tides. The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge.

===Mollusca===
The violet sea-snail (&quot;Janthina janthina&quot;) uses a buoyant foam raft stabilized by amphiphilic mucins to float at the sea surface.

===Arachnids===
The wheel spider (&quot;Carparachne aureoflava&quot;) is a huntsman spider approximately 20 mm in size and native to the Namib Desert of Southern Africa. The spider escapes parasitic pompilid wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes at speeds of up to 44 turns per second. If the spider is on a sloped dune, its rolling speed may be 1 metre per second.

A spider (usually limited to individuals of a small species), or spiderling after hatching, climbs as high as it can, stands on raised legs with its abdomen pointed upwards (&quot;tiptoeing&quot;), and then releases several silk threads from its spinnerets into the air. These form a triangle-shaped parachute that carries the spider on updrafts of winds, where even the slightest breeze transports it. The Earth&#x27;s static electric field may also provide lift in windless conditions.

===Insects===
The larva of &quot;Cicindela dorsalis&quot;, the eastern beach tiger beetle, is notable for its ability to leap into the air, loop its body into a rotating wheel and roll along the sand at a high speed using wind to propel itself. If the wind is strong enough, the larva can cover up to in this manner. This remarkable ability may have evolved to help the larva escape predators such as the thynnid wasp &quot;Methocha&quot;.

Members of the largest subfamily of cuckoo wasps, Chrysidinae, are generally kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva while it is still young. Chrysidines are distinguished from the members of other subfamilies in that most have flattened or concave lower abdomens and can curl into a defensive ball when attacked by a potential host, a process known as conglobation. Protected by hard chitin in this position, they are expelled from the nest without injury and can search for a less hostile host.

Fleas can jump vertically up to 18 cm and horizontally up to 33 cm; however, although this form of locomotion is initiated by the flea, it has little control of the jump—they always jump in the same direction, with very little variation in the trajectory between individual jumps.

===Crustaceans===
Although stomatopods typically display the standard locomotion types as seen in true shrimp and lobsters, one species, &quot;Nannosquilla decemspinosa&quot;, has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, &quot;N. decemspinosa&quot; is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for locomotion when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. &quot;N. decemspinosa&quot; has been observed to roll repeatedly for , but they typically travel less than . Again, the animal initiates the movement but has little control during its locomotion.

===Animal transport===

Some animals change location because they are attached to, or reside on, another animal or moving structure. This is arguably more accurately termed &quot;animal transport&quot;.

====Remoras====
Remoras are a family (&quot;Echeneidae&quot;) of ray-finned fish. They grow to long, and their distinctive first dorsal fins take the form of a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals. By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion. When the remora reaches about , the disc is fully formed and the remora can then attach to other animals. The remora&#x27;s lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and the animal lacks a swim bladder. Some remoras associate primarily with specific host species. They are commonly found attached to sharks, manta rays, whales, turtles, and dugongs. Smaller remoras also fasten onto fish such as tuna and swordfish, and some small remoras travel in the mouths or gills of large manta rays, ocean sunfish, swordfish, and sailfish. The remora benefits by using the host as transport and protection, and also feeds on materials dropped by the host.

====Angler fish====
In some species of anglerfish, when a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.

====Parasites====
Many parasites are transported by their hosts. For example, endoparasites such as tapeworms live in the alimentary tracts of other animals, and depend on the host&#x27;s ability to move to distribute their eggs. Ectoparasites such as fleas can move around on the body of their host, but are transported much longer distances by the host&#x27;s locomotion. Some ectoparasites such as lice can opportunistically hitch a ride on a fly (phoresis) and attempt to find a new host.

==Changes between media==
Some animals locomote between different media, e.g., from aquatic to aerial. This often requires different modes of locomotion in the different media and may require a distinct transitional locomotor behaviour.

There are a large number of semi-aquatic animals (animals that spend part of their life cycle in water, or generally have part of their anatomy underwater). These represent the major taxa of mammals (e.g., beaver, otter, polar bear), birds (e.g., penguins, ducks), reptiles (e.g., anaconda, bog turtle, marine iguana) and amphibians (e.g., salamanders, frogs, newts).

===Fish===
Some fish use multiple modes of locomotion. Walking fish may swim freely or at other times &quot;walk&quot; along the ocean or river floor, but not on land (e.g., the flying gurnard—which does not actually fly—and batfishes of the family Ogcocephalidae). Amphibious fish, are fish that are able to leave water for extended periods of time. These fish use a range of terrestrial locomotory modes, such as lateral undulation, tripod-like walking (using paired fins and tail), and jumping. Many of these locomotory modes incorporate multiple combinations of pectoral, pelvic and tail fin movement. Examples include eels, mudskippers and the walking catfish. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water&#x27;s surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defence mechanism to evade predators. The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 m, though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to . They can travel at speeds of more than . Maximum altitude is above the surface of the sea. Some accounts have them landing on ships&#x27; decks.

===Marine mammals===

When swimming, several marine mammals such as dolphins, porpoises and pinnipeds, frequently leap above the water surface whilst maintaining horizontal locomotion. This is done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save dolphins and porpoises energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as &quot;porpoising&quot;. Other reasons for dolphins and porpoises performing porpoising include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites. In pinnipeds, two types of porpoising have been identified. &quot;High porpoising&quot; is most often near (within 100 m) the shore and is often followed by minor course changes; this may help seals get their bearings on beaching or rafting sites. &quot;Low porpoising&quot; is typically observed relatively far (more than 100 m) from shore and often aborted in favour of anti-predator movements; this may be a way for seals to maximize sub-surface vigilance and thereby reduce their vulnerability to sharks

Some whales raise their (entire) body vertically out of the water in a behaviour known as &quot;breaching&quot;.

===Birds===
Some semi-aquatic birds use terrestrial locomotion, surface swimming, underwater swimming and flying (e.g., ducks, swans). Diving birds also use diving locomotion (e.g., dippers, auks). Some birds (e.g., ratites) have lost the primary locomotion of flight. The largest of these, ostriches, when being pursued by a predator, have been known to reach speeds over , and can maintain a steady speed of , which makes the ostrich the world&#x27;s fastest two-legged animal: Ostriches can also locomote by swimming. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called &quot;tobogganing&quot;, which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain. To get onto land, penguins sometimes propel themselves upwards at a great speed to leap out the water.

==Changes during the life-cycle==
An animal&#x27;s mode of locomotion may change considerably during its life-cycle. Barnacles are exclusively marine and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters. They have two nektonic (active swimming) larval stages, but as adults, they are sessile (non-motile) suspension feeders. Frequently, adults are found attached to moving objects such as whales and ships, and are thereby transported (passive locomotion) around the oceans.

==Function==
Animals locomote for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a suitable microhabitat, or to escape predators.

===Food procurement===

Animals use locomotion in a wide variety of ways to procure food. Terrestrial methods include ambush predation, social predation and grazing. Aquatic methods include filterfeeding, grazing, ram feeding, suction feeding, protrusion and pivot feeding. Other methods include parasitism and parasitoidism.

== Quantifying body and limb movement ==
The study of animal locomotion is a branch of biology that investigates and quantifies how animals move. It is an application of kinematics, used to understand how the movements of animal limbs relate to the motion of the whole animal, for instance when walking or flying.

<doc id="1132762" wikidata="Q277011" url="?curid=1132762" title="Symphony No. 96 (Haydn)">
<text>The Symphony No. 96 in D major, Hoboken I/96, was completed by Joseph Haydn in 1791 as part of the set of symphonies composed on his first trip to London. It was first performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 11 March 1791. Although it is the fourth of the twelve London symphonies (numbers 93–104) by number, it was actually the first one written and performed. It is popularly known as the Miracle Symphony.

The autograph manuscript of the symphony is preserved in the British Library.

== Nickname (The Miracle) ==
Symphony No. 96 has been called the Miracle symphony due to the story that, during its premiere, a chandelier fell from the ceiling of the concert hall in which it was performed. The audience managed to dodge the chandelier successfully as they had all crowded to the front for the post-performance applause, and the symphony got its nickname from this. More careful and recent research suggests that this event actually took place during the 1795 premiere of his Symphony No. 102.

== Movements ==
The work is in standard four movement form and scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

#Adagio, – Allegro, 
#Andante, in G major
#Menuetto: Allegretto, 
#Finale: Vivace, 

The first movement is in sonata form. Following a slow introduction, the first theme of the exposition is actually two overlapping themes, a short–short–short–long repeated-note theme in the first violins over a falling motif in the middle strings and bassoons. Following a brief transitional section, the first theme returns giving the opening section a ternary structure. The first theme group closes with fanfares featuring repeated notes. What follows is a more extended transition featuring three repeated eighth-notes as in the opening of the Allegro. There is no true second theme group making this a three-key exposition. The expositional coda also features motifs containing three eighth notes. The development can be divided into three sections. The first section develops the exposition&#x27;s first theme and the second develops themes from the exposition&#x27;s coda. Both of these sections touch on the relative minor, B minor. Following a two-measure grand pause, the third section opens with a false recapitulation of the exposition in the wrong key of G major which quickly collapses into more development of the first theme. When the recapitulation arrives, it proceeds quickly. Following another transition, the fanfares from the first theme group return building up to an unexpected stormy climax in D minor leaving just seven measures of D major to bring the movement to a close.

The slow movement in G major is in ternary form (A–B–A) featuring a lightly scored, lilting theme with three upbeats. The central &quot;B&quot; section of the movement is for full tutti in G minor and is highly contrapuntal. The second &quot;A&quot; section finishes suspended on a cadential six-four chord. The following coda is indeed an orchestral cadenza featuring solos from the two principal violinists (including Salomon) and solos from the principal winds as well.

The trio of the minuet features an extended oboe solo.

The finale is a five-part rondo form (A–B–A–C–A), although it does include some elements of sonata form, implying that it could be a hybrid of both forms. The principal A section is primarily for the strings but are joined by the woodwinds in other areas. The B section revolves around D minor, while the C section features a short modulation to A major, thus showing a similarity to sonata form as mentioned above. Rhythmic patterns from both sections are referenced in the movement&#x27;s coda.

<doc id="1132764" wikidata="Q1461541" url="?curid=1132764" title="Westwork">
<text>A westwork (), forepart, avant-corps or avancorpo is the monumental, west-facing entrance section (&quot;west front&quot;) of a Carolingian, Ottonian, or Romanesque church. The exterior consists of multiple stories between two towers. The interior includes an entrance vestibule, a chapel, and a series of galleries overlooking the nave. A westwork is usually broader than the width of the nave and aisles. It is sometimes used synonymously with narthex. The structural purpose of the massive westwork is to resolve the horizontal thrust of the east-to-west arcades of the nave. Church towers as a part of a church began with the construction of the first westworks.

Charlemagne dreamt of reviving the Roman Empire in the West. His dream along with his artistic skillset allowed him to implement artwork into buildings with westwork during this time period and can be found in the Corvey Abbey and scattered throughout other westwork buildings today.

The Corvey Abbey (built in 885) located in Germany is the oldest example of westwork to date. The Corvey Abbey provides an example of westwork preserved from the time being built. The frescos (originally of the 9th century) inside the westwork show scenes from the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The King, later the Emperor, and his entourage lodged in the westwork when visiting the abbey during their travels around the country. This is known as the &quot;Kaiserloge&quot; on the upper, or second story. The centered room located on the main floor surrounded on all three sides by galleries as well as an arch found in the entrance hall of the Corvey Abbey shows an example of ancient styles used during this time. Westwork from the Corvey Abbey provided a basis in the following years for more architectural advancements in the Romanesque and Gothic periods.

The primary source of Trajan&#x27;s Aqueduct, the Aqua Traiana, a nymphaeum known as the Madonna della Fiora near Rome, is documented in the Historical Diocesan Archive of Nepi and Sutri as having been converted into a church in medieval times by constructing a westwork. &quot;It was adapted to a church by building a two-floor masonary forepart: the lower floor as the facade of the church; the upper floor as residence of the parish priest divided into 5 rooms.&quot;

The feature was introduced into Norman architecture in the 11th century by Robert of Jumièges at the church of Jumièges Abbey, consecrated in 1067. The pattern was continued in German Gothic architecture.

<doc id="1132770" wikidata="Q7710153" url="?curid=1132770" title="Thanatopsis">
<text>&quot;Thanatopsis&quot; is an early poem by the American poet William Cullen Bryant. Meaning &#x27;a consideration of death&#x27;, the word is derived from the Greek &#x27;thanatos&#x27; (death) and &#x27;opsis&#x27; (view, sight).

==Background==
William Cullen Bryant was born in 1794 in Cummington, Massachusetts. Bryant grew up in a Puritan home with his father, Peter Bryant, a prominent doctor who provided him with much of his early education. In his early life Bryant would spend a great deal of time in the woods surrounding his family&#x27;s New England home, and read of the extensive personal library his father had. Bryant&#x27;s first published poem was &quot;The Embargo; or, Sketches of the Times&quot;, a satirical work concerning Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo Act of 1807. It was released in a Boston newspaper in 1808. In 1810 Bryant was forced to leave Williams College for lack of money. Instead of a formal education, he started studying law, and began learning an eclectic mix of poetry, such as the works of Isaac Watts and Henry Kirke White, and verses like William Cowper&#x27;s &quot;The Task&quot; and Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

When and where Bryant wrote &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; is unclear, and Bryant himself could not remember when he wrote the verse. According to Parke Godwin, Bryant&#x27;s friend, Bryant wrote the poem when he was seventeen years old in mid-1811, just after he had left Williams College.

Bryant reportedly wrote his first draft of &quot;Thanotopsis&quot; in Flora&#x27;s Glen in Williamstown.

In &quot;History of American Literature&quot;, two dates are stated for the authoring of &quot;Thanatopsis&quot;, 1811 and 1816. Bryant&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; came after reading William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, as well as Robert Blair&#x27;s &quot;The Grave&quot;, Beilby Porteus&#x27;s &quot;Death&quot; and Kirke White&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot;. After Bryant had left Cummington to begin his law studies, his father discovered a manuscript in Bryant&#x27;s desk drawer, that contained &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; and a fragment of a poem, which would be published under the title &quot;The Fragment&quot;, and later titled &quot;An Inscription upon the Entrance to a Wood&quot;. He sent the two poems without his son&#x27;s knowledge to the editors at the &quot;North American Review&quot;, where they were published in September 1817. The editors added an introduction to Thanatopsis in a completely different style. The part written by the author begins with &quot;Yet a few days,&quot;. The author republished the poem in 1821 in a collection of works called &quot;Poems&quot;. He replaced the introductory section, made a few minor changes to the text and added more material after the original end of the poem, which was &quot;and make their bed with thee!&quot;. Below is the revised version of 1821 which was retained in all later publications of the poem:

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
To him who in the love of Nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—
Go forth, under the open sky, and list
To Nature’s teachings, while from all around
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—
Comes a still voice—Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix for ever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.

Yet not to thine eternal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,
The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods—rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,—
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there:
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.

So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,
The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man—
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.
So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, which moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Critical reception==
Due to the unusual quality of the verse and Bryant&#x27;s age, Richard Henry Dana Sr., then associate editor at the &quot;North American Review&quot;, initially doubted its authenticity, saying to another editor, &quot;No one, on this side of the Atlantic, is capable of writing such verses.&quot;

&quot;Thanatopsis&quot; remains a milestone in American literary history. &quot;Poems&quot; was considered by many to be the first major book of American poetry. Nevertheless, over five years, it earned Bryant only $14.92. Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers, who often accused other writers of stealing poems, said that the only thing Bryant &quot;ever wrote that may be called &quot;Poetry&quot; is &#x27;Thanatopsis,&#x27; which he stole &quot;line for line&quot; from the Spanish.&quot;

==Appearances in popular culture==
In &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; by Thomas Harris, Clarice Starling reveals to Hannibal Lecter one detail of her father&#x27;s last days in a hospital: an elderly neighbour reading to him the last lines of &quot;Thanatopsis.&quot; In Sinclair Lewis&#x27; novel &quot;Main Street&quot;, the women&#x27;s study club of Gopher Prairie is the Thanatopsis club.

The experimental band Thanatopsis (featuring Buckethead and Travis Dickerson) was named after this poem. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Thanatopsis&quot;, was also named after this poem. The electronic artist Daedelus named the last song on the album &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; after the poem.

The Thanatopsis Pleasure and Inside Straight Club, or Thanatopsis Chowder and Marching Society, or the Young Men’s Upper West Side Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Poker Club, were all used as names for a certain poker game that was first formed in Paris during the First World War in the back room at Nini’s. The New Yorker founder Harold Ross, Ring Lardner, Alexander Woollcott, Grantland Rice, and F. P. Adams were among the original players. This poker club later re-emerged in NYC when these and other literary figures began meeting at the Algonquin Hotel, where they would play upstairs- before the round table downstairs was eventually ceded to meet the needs of a larger group than the poker game could contain.

The Avant Garde film-maker Ed Emshwiller&#x27;s 1962 short film &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; was inspired by the poem. In the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Terminal,&quot; a portion of the poem is set to folk music and sung by writer/producer Dave Willis.

In 1934, Scott Bradley composed an oratorio based on &quot;Thanatopsis&quot;.

In the 1942 film &quot;Grand Central Murder&quot;, the private railway car where the showgirl is murdered is named Thanatopsis.

In 1942, the night before his execution by a Japanese firing squad, United States Army Air Corps pilot William G. Farrow referenced the poem in a letter he wrote to his mother. He had been captured after flying a B-25 Mitchell bomber on the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. He told her, &quot;Read &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; by Bryant if you want to know how I am taking this. My faith in God is complete, so I am unafraid.&quot;

The American author of detective fiction Phoebe Atwood Taylor has her hero Leonidas Witherall recount the first lines in her 1947 book &quot;The Iron Clew&quot;. The poem is also mentioned in Taylor&#x27;s 1934 book &quot;The Mystery of the Cape Cod Tavern&quot; as having been part of an obituary.

The seminal conservationist Aldo Leopold quoted several passages from &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; in his posthumously published essay &quot;Some Fundamentals of Conservation in the Southwest.&quot;

In August Wilson&#x27;s 2003 play &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;, Solly offers the final nine lines of the poem (&quot;So live . . . pleasant dreams&quot;) as a toast to send off Citizen Barlow to the city of bones. Eli joins Solly in the recitation, offering his own interpretation of the lines: &quot;You die by how you live.&quot;

The Acacia fraternity adopted the last stanza as their code.

Cindy Williams reads from &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; in Andy Kaufman&#x27;s ABC-TV special aired in 1979.

In the 2020 film &quot;Driveways&quot;, Jerry Adler&#x27;s character quotes the poem as a sudden memory from his childhood; a sign he has dementia.

<text>Mount Soledad, also known as Soledad Mountain, is a prominent landmark in San Diego, California, United States. The mountaintop is the site of the Mount Soledad Cross.

== Geography ==
The mountain lies between Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is mostly within the community of La Jolla where the northern and eastern slopes form a sharp escarpment along the Rose Canyon Fault. The community of Pacific Beach is on the gentler southern slope. There are several radio and television transmitters located on the summit including KFMB-TV and KGTV, the CBS and ABC affiliates respectively. Commercial aircraft approaching San Diego from the direction of Los Angeles often use Mount Soledad as their point to start the downwind leg of their approach to San Diego International Airport.

== Land events ==
On October 3, 2007, a landslide destroyed two homes, damaged several others and ripped up more than 100 yards of a residential street on Soledad Mountain. Five houses were damaged, and over 20 others were evacuated. The City of San Diego had noticed water and gas main leaks since July, and cracks in the pavement since August 2007.

== Legend of Munchkin land ==
There is an urban legend that in the 1930s, a group of little people who appeared in Hollywood films such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, came to San Diego, where they built miniature houses on Mount Soledad.

The legend gained traction due to the fact several houses were built on steep slopes overlooking the Pacific. As passing observers looked down, the perspective made doors and other features appear smaller than normal. Most of the supposed &quot;Munchkin Houses&quot; have been remodeled and the effect is no longer present.

== Last home of Dr. Seuss ==
Mount Soledad is the location of the last home lived in by Dr. Seuss. His widow, Audrey Geisel, resided atop Mount Soledad in a lavish home, which includes an observation tower referred to as the &quot;Seuss house&quot; by the locals, until her death in 2018.

== Cycling ==
Because of the variety of long steady climbs, light traffic on most routes, and great views, Mount Soledad is a popular cycling destination and area. There are numerous routes ranging from the relatively gradual, climb up Soledad Mountain Road on the southern slopes to the very steep and short, , Hidden Valley Road to Via Capri route on the north side.

==Mount Soledad Cross==
Mount Soledad is topped by a large concrete Christian cross, first built in 1913, and since rebuilt twice. The third and current version was dedicated in 1954 as the Mount Soledad Easter Cross; the word &quot;Easter&quot; was dropped in the 1980s. After the cross was challenged in court during the late 1980s, it was designated a Korean War memorial. It became the center of a controversy over the display of religious symbols on government property.

It was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January 2011.

On June 25, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari, allowing the order of the Ninth Circuit to stand.

In July 2015, a group called the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association reported that it had bought the half-acre of land under the cross from the Department of Defense for $1.4 million. On September 7, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a one-page ruling, ordering dismissal of the case and an end to all current appeals, stating that the case was now moot because the cross was no longer on government land. Both sides agreed that this decision puts a final end to the case.

<doc id="1132775" wikidata="Q1345602" url="?curid=1132775" title="Wild Life (Wings album)">
<text>Wild Life is the debut studio album by the British-American rock band Wings and the third studio album by Paul McCartney after the breakup of the Beatles. The album was mainly recorded in seven sessions between 24 July and 4 September 1971 (additional overdubs were added during sessions in October 1971), at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) by McCartney, his wife Linda, session drummer Denny Seiwell, whom they had worked with on the McCartneys&#x27; previous album &quot;Ram&quot;, and guitarist Denny Laine, formerly of the English rock band the Moody Blues. It was released by Apple Records on 7 December in the UK and US, to lukewarm critical and commercial reaction.

== Recording ==
In July 1971, with a fresh set of McCartney tunes, the newly formed Wings recorded the album in slightly more than a week with the mindset that it had to be instant and raw in order to capture the freshness and vitality of a live studio recording. It was claimed at the time that five of the eight songs were recorded in one take, but this was later revealed to be untrue; only &#x27;Dear Friend&#x27; was tracked in one pass. Paul McCartney later cited the quick recording schedule of Bob Dylan as an inspiration for this. The first session was held at Abbey Road Studios on Saturday, 24 July. Footage of McCartney playing &quot;Bip Bop&quot; and &quot;Hey Diddle&quot; from around this time was later included in the made-for-TV film &quot;Wings Over the World&quot;.

The album was rehearsed at McCartney&#x27;s recording studio in Scotland, dubbed Rude Studio, which Paul and Linda had used to make demos of songs that would be used in the album, and recorded at Abbey Road with Tony Clark and Alan Parsons engineering. Paul had lead vocal parts on all tracks, sharing those duties with Linda on &quot;I Am Your Singer&quot; and &quot;Some People Never Know&quot;. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; features background vocals from Denny Laine and Linda McCartney.

After the rehearsals at Rude, the recording moved to Abbey Road Studios, where the album was completed in a few weeks. According to drummer Denny Seiwell, five of the eight recorded tracks were done in one take. One almost definite example of this is &quot;Mumbo&quot;, the opener on the album. According to Clark, they were jamming and Clark decided to start recording. McCartney, upon noticing, shouted &quot;Take it, Tony&quot; and started ad-libbing lyrics.

On the promotional album &quot;The Complete Audio Guide to the Alan Parsons Project&quot;, Parsons discusses how he created a rough mix of &quot;I Am Your Singer&quot; that Paul liked so much, he used it for the final mix on the album.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Dear Friend&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Ram&quot; sessions, was apparently an attempt at reconciliation with John Lennon. It followed Lennon&#x27;s attack on McCartney in the song &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, from the album &quot;Imagine&quot;, which had been in retaliation for McCartney&#x27;s perceived digs at Lennon in &quot;Too Many People&quot; on &quot;Ram&quot;. Music critic Ian MacDonald cited &quot;Dear Friend&quot; as a counter-argument to the caricature of McCartney as an emotional lightweight.

&quot;Wild Life&quot; also included a reggae remake of Mickey &amp; Sylvia&#x27;s 1957 top 40 hit &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;. A promotional single was distributed in the UK by Apple in December 1971 with catalogue No. R5932, but the commercial release was cancelled due to poor album sales.

==Release and reception==
After announcing to the media the band&#x27;s formation on 2 August 1971, the group were named &quot;Wings&quot; on 9 October. On 8 November, the group held a press party in London to announce both the group and &quot;Wild Life&quot;, which was released on 3 December in the UK and 6 December in the US, to lukewarm critical and commercial reaction. The album reached number 11 in the UK and number 10 in the US, where it went gold. At the same press party, in an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, McCartney said that the group should soon be performing live. John Mendelsohn wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he wondered whether the album may have been &quot;deliberately second-rate.&quot; In &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler called the album &quot;rushed, defensive, badly timed, and over-publicized&quot; and wrote that it showed McCartney&#x27;s songwriting &quot;at an absolute nadir just when he needed a little respect&quot;. The liner notes for &quot;Wild Life&quot; (and on the &quot;Thrillington&quot; album) were credited to Clint Harrigan, a nom de plume of McCartney. Lennon claimed to know the identity of Harrigan during their &quot;Melody Maker&quot; feud in 1972.

In December 1971, a &quot;Ram&quot; outtake &quot;Breakfast Blues&quot; was mixed by Paul and Linda at A&amp;R Studios. &quot;Breakfast Blues&quot; was played on WCBS-FM, where McCartney promoted Wings and &quot;Wild Life&quot;, on 15 December. The track was later released as &quot;Great Cock and Seagull Race&quot; on the 2012 special edition of &quot;Ram&quot;.

The album was first released on CD by EMI&#x27;s budget Fame label, on 5 October 1987. In addition to naming the previously hidden tracks (&quot;Bip Bop Link&quot; and &quot;Mumbo Link&quot;), this edition added &quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Another Day&quot;), &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; and &quot;Little Woman Love&quot; as bonus tracks. In 1993, &quot;Wild Life&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD as part of &#x27;The Paul McCartney Collection&#x27; series with singles &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot; and &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; as well as B-sides &quot;Little Woman Love&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Little Girl&quot;—all recorded in 1972 except for &quot;Little Woman Love&quot;, which was a &quot;Ram&quot; outtake (&quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot; appeared separately as a bonus track on the 1993 reissue of &quot;Ram&quot;). A version recorded in the garden of Paul&#x27;s Scotland home circa June 1971 of the bluegrass-styled &quot;Bip Bop&quot; featured Paul and Linda&#x27;s daughter Mary giggling in the background, and segued into a riff called &quot;Hey Diddle&quot;. This surfaced in 2001 on the compilation &quot;&quot;.

In 2007, Paul McCartney&#x27;s catalogue was released on iTunes. &quot;Wild Life&quot; received an instrumental version of &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot; (originally released as b-side of the single) as a bonus track.

In 2018, &quot;Wild Life&quot; was reissued as part of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. The deluxe package included a 128-page book written by David Fricke telling the story behind the album, a 48-page scrapbook, previously unpublished Polaroids, lyrics, notes and memorabilia from the MPL archives. The bonus tracks included the single &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot; and its instrumental b-side, promo single edit of &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; and a number of home demos and studio outtakes, including unedited home performances of &quot;Bip Bop&quot; and &quot;Hey Diddle&quot;, previously released on &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1132777" wikidata="Q256620" url="?curid=1132777" title="Loyal to the Game">
<text>Loyal to the Game is the ninth studio album and fifth posthumous studio album by American rapper Tupac Shakur. The album was produced by Eminem and consists of remixes of previously unreleased music recorded by Tupac before his death in 1996. Released in the United States on December 14, 2004, &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Background ==
During an interview with MTV, Eminem stated he was so moved by Tupac&#x27;s life and work that he wrote a letter to Tupac&#x27;s mother, Afeni Shakur, asking her to consider letting him produce his next album. Shakur agreed, allowing Eminem to produce three new songs for the 2003 soundtrack album, &quot;&quot;, and the entirety of &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;, bar bonus content.

All songs on the album were recorded prior to Tupac&#x27;s involvement in the controversial East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry, serving as the second posthumous album released consisting of material from this time period, the first being 1997&#x27;s &quot;R U Still Down? (Remember Me)&quot;. Although the songs are mostly unreleased, the title track, &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;, was previously released on the cassette edition of the 1994 soundtrack album &quot;Above the Rim&quot;, and subsequently as the B-side to the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Regulate&quot;.

The album featured two singles: &quot;Thugs Get Lonely Too&quot;, which served as a promotional single for the album, and &quot;Ghetto Gospel&quot;, which served as the lead single. Originally, &quot;Ghetto Gospel&quot; was recorded for inclusion on the 1992 Christmas compilation &quot;A Very Special Christmas 2&quot;, but due to Tupac&#x27;s legal troubles, the song was dropped from the album. This original version has a much faster tempo and features a third and fourth verse which didn&#x27;t feature in Eminem&#x27;s remix.

== Production ==
&quot;Loyal to the Game&quot; marks the only posthumous Tupac album not to feature any original production. When remixing these songs, Eminem used various unusual production techniques, namely, modifying the pace and pitch of Tupac&#x27;s voice to better suit the instrumentals he produced. The style of the production on the album fitted more to the form of a Shady/Aftermath release, of which Eminem partly created, than it did to any original or previous posthumous Tupac release. There were also various uses of cutting and pasting vocals to produce new words synonymous with rap culture at that time, such as making it sound as though Tupac is saying, &quot;2005&quot;, &quot;G-Unit&quot;, &quot;Obie Trice&quot; and &quot;Em&quot;.

Although &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot; was produced by Eminem, the album does feature four bonus remixes, with production coming from Scott Storch, Red Spyda, Raphael Saadiq, and DJ Quik, though, the bonus track produced by Scott Storch, &quot;Po Nigga Blues&quot;, does not feature in Eminem form on the main album. It is unknown if Eminem did or did not produce a version of that song.

== Critical reception and commercial performance ==
&quot;Loyal to the Game&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week-sales of over 330,000 copies in its first week. On February 15, 2005, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million copies in the US. As of September 2011, the album has sold 1,204,124 copies in the United States.

== Track listing ==

;Sample credits
*&quot;Ghetto Gospel&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Indian Sunset&quot; performed by Elton John.
*&quot;Don&#x27;t You Trust Me?&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Do You Have a Little Time&quot; performed by Dido.
*&quot;N.I.G.G.A.&quot; contains a sample of &quot;(Don&#x27;t Worry) If There&#x27;s a Hell Below, We&#x27;re All Going to Go&quot; performed by Curtis Mayfield.

;Notes
*Originally, &quot;Out on Bail&quot; was intended for an unreleased version of &quot;Thug Life: Volume 1&quot; but due to controversial reasons, the original version did not make the final cut and was remixed after Eminem went on board. The original version can be found on YouTube.

<text>is a brand of instant ramen noodles, cup noodles, and &quot;Yakisoba&quot; produced by Toyo Suisan of Tokyo, Japan. The &quot;Maruchan&quot; brand is used for noodle products in Japan and as the operating name for Toyo Suisan&#x27;s division in the United States, Maruchan Inc. In 1972, Toyo Suisan entered the American market with Maruchan USA, and in 1977, established a plant in Irvine, California. Maruchan has other plants in Richmond, Virginia, and one in Bexar County, Texas. Maruchan produces over 3.6 billion packages of ramen noodle soup a year. In the United States and Mexico, Maruchan ramen is widely popular.

==History==

Toyo Suisan Kaisha, Ltd of Tokyo, Japan, founded on March 28, 1953, is a consumer packaged foods company in Japan. Toyo Suisan&#x27;s effort to become an international food company brought them to the United States, where, in 1972, they established Maruchan USA. At first, Maruchan USA was only a marketing company, importing and distributing ramen from Japan. After operating for five years as a distributor of imported products, Maruchan built its manufacturing facility in Irvine, California, in 1977, where it began producing Maruchan brand ramen. Since 1977 Maruchan has grown steadily and has become an industry leader in North America, alongside other instant noodle brands such as Top Ramen and Sapporo Ichiban.

==Name==
Maruchan is a Japanese word composed of two parts, maru and chan. Maru means round, as in the shape of a ball or a happy child&#x27;s face. In Japanese, roundness has a connotation of friendliness. The word chan is an honorific suffix, used affectionately for a child or as a term of endearment.

<doc id="1132799" wikidata="Q2426197" url="?curid=1132799" title="Anti-Monitor">
<text>The Anti-Monitor is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He served as the main antagonist of the 1985 DC Comics miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and later appears as an enemy to the Green Lantern Corps and the Justice League.

In 2009, Anti-Monitor was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 49th-greatest comic book villain of all time.

LaMonica Garrett portrayed the character as the main antagonist in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, as well as The Monitor.

==Publication history==
The Anti-Monitor first appeared in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #2 (although he remained in shadow until &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #5) and was created by Marv Wolfman, George Pérez, and Jerry Ordway. He was believed to have been destroyed in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #12 only to return after a long absence in &quot;Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special&quot; #1 (August 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===

During &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, it was revealed how the existence of all parallel universes in the Multiverse came to be, including the positive matter multiverse and also the anti-matter universe, and how the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor came into existence; when the menace posed by the Anti-Monitor became apparent, several villains were sent back in time to stop him, but were defeated by Krona and the other Oans. In a final revision, it was established that it increased entropy in the universe, shortening its existence by a billion years (see heat death). In any event, two beings were created, one on the moon of Oa and the other on the moon of Qward. On Oa, the being known as the Monitor was instantly aware of his counterpart, the Anti-Monitor (although his official name is the Monitor in his own universe, and he is often addressed as such, the name Anti-Monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart). By this time the Anti-Monitor had quickly conquered Qward, as well as the rest of the anti-matter universe. In searching for other places to conquer, he also became aware of his counterpart. The two battled for a million years before eventually defeating each other, becoming inert for nine billion years.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, it was revealed that the Monitor was originally a probe created by the Overmonitor to learn more about the multiverse. However, being unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time, the probe-Monitor was split into two symmetrical, opposite beings: the Monitor, embodying the positive matter and goodness, and the Anti-Monitor, embodying anti-matter and evil.

===&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===
In more modern times, Pariah performed an experiment similar to the one Krona attempted long ago on a parallel Earth (this was changed later to an alternate world in the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; single universe). This experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor and the destruction of Pariah&#x27;s universe. The Anti-Monitor rebuilt his army, taking over Qward and using the Thunderers as his own private army, as well as creating the Shadow Demons from the elite of the Thunderers.

The Anti-Monitor then released a massive anti-matter wave, absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes to grow in strength, and employed the second Psycho-Pirate, using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy. The Monitor, along with his aide Harbinger, gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes to combat the Anti-Monitor. The Anti-Monitor controlled one of Harbinger&#x27;s duplicates and apparently killed the Monitor, but the Monitor created a pocket universe to contain and protect the remaining universes.

After defeats by various heroes, including Supergirl and the Flash (Barry Allen) sacrificing themselves to save Superman, and to destroy an anti-matter cannon respectively, the Anti-Monitor absorbed the entirety of the anti-matter universe and traveled to the beginning of time, intending to stop the formation of the positive matter Multiverse and to create a Multiverse where anti-matter prevailed. When the heroes followed him there, he began to drain the power from most of them.

However, the actions of the Spectre, empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving Earths, brought the Anti-Monitor to a stalemate. The villains of said Earths, sent to stop Krona from viewing the origins of the universe, failed due to squabbling, allowing Krona to see the hands of the Anti-Monitor and the Spectre struggling for domination, which collapsed the current Multiverse.

From the ashes rose a new, singular universe. While various persons adjusted to the newly singular Earth (including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the Multiverse), the Anti-Monitor, enraged, drew this new Earth into the anti-matter universe, intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all. What followed was the Shadow Demon War, wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s forces. Finally, the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains (most notably Doctor Light; the heroic Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three; Darkseid; Superboy of Earth Prime; and Kal-L, the Superman of Earth-Two) weakened the Anti-Monitor enough for Kal-L to deliver the final blow, destroying the Anti-Monitor by punching him into a star. The star went nova and caused anti-matter waves to erupt, threatening to destroy the entire anti-matter universe. Kal-L and Superboy-Prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates, when Luthor revealed that he had created a &quot;paradise dimension&quot;, and he used it to prevent the Lois Lane Kent of Earth-Two from being erased from existence when the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; universe was formed, as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow Superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss. Using his body as a portal, Alexander Luthor, Kal-L, and Superboy-Prime went into the &quot;paradise dimension&quot; alongside Lois.

Among the other beings who died because of his actions were the Crime Syndicate of America, Kid Psycho, Nighthawk, the Losers, Flower of Easy Company, Starman, the Immortal Man, the Dove, Kole, Clayface II, the Bug-Eyed Bandit, the Angle Man, Prince Ra-Man, Sunburst, Lori Lemaris, Aquagirl, Earth-2&#x27;s Green Arrow, Huntress, Robin, and Alexander Luthor Sr. of Earth-Three.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
The Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and Alexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three were revealed to be observing the events of the newly formed universe, as well as the actions of its heroes, from their home in the hidden pocket universe. Upon observing the events leading up to &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore Earth-Two&#x27;s existence, at the expense of Earth-One.

The Anti-Monitor’s remains were then recovered from deep space and used as the central component in the construction of a multiverse-tuning tower created by Alexander Luthor, similar to the ones used during the first Crisis. This tower then created the vibrational frequency that Earth-Two was on prior to its non-existence, which in turn recreated Earth-Two with no visible effect on Earth-One, save the movement of characters who originated on Earth-Two to the recreated Earth-Two. Alexander Luthor then recreated the other Earths using the tower, with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said Earths. Superboy-Prime (followed soon by Bart Allen) then returned from the Speed Force wearing what appeared to be select elements of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s armor, using it as a yellow sunlight collector. Ultimately, the tower was destroyed during a clash between Kon-El, the modern Superboy, and Superboy-Prime when the two smashed into the tower during their battle, causing it to collapse and coalescing all of the separate Earths into a new Earth once again. Kon-El died in the arms of Wonder Girl as Superboy-Prime fled. As a result of the tower’s collapse, the Anti-Monitor’s remains were completely destroyed.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===

At the end of DC Comics&#x27; 2006 special &quot;Brave New World&quot;, it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves &quot;the Monitors&quot; watching over the new post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; Earth. Four of the figures resemble the original Monitor from &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and the fifth figure resembles the Anti-Monitor. In the pages of &quot;Countdown&quot;, it has been revealed that there are fifty-two Monitors, with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new Multiverse, each with a slightly different appearance. A Monitor was shown in &quot;Supergirl&quot; recalling Dark Angel, one of his agents. This Monitor was dressed like the Anti-Monitor, but appeared to have no other connection.
===Sinestro Corps===
It was revealed that the Anti-Monitor was reborn following the recreation of the Multiverse and had been fueling Sinestro&#x27;s ideology since the return of Hal Jordan, acting as the Sinestro Corps&#x27; &quot;Guardian of Fear&quot;. His body was rebuilt by the Manhunters, and in addition, he recruited Superboy-Prime, the Cyborg Superman, and Parallax, who was using Kyle Rayner as its host, along with Sinestro as his heralds.

During the war between the Sinestro Corps and the Green Lantern Corps, the Anti-Monitor contacted Cyborg Superman to inquire about the status of New Warworld. The cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon Qward and that he would kill Henshaw for his services, allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the Cyborg.

When the Lost Lanterns made their way to the anti-matter universe to save Hal Jordan and the Ion power, they inadvertently stumbled upon the Anti-Monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on Qward. He was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the Ion entity previously inhabiting Kyle Rayner. He proceeded to kill Ke&#x27;Haan before the other Lanterns forced him back, taking the Ion entity from the planet and the anti-matter universe. The Anti-Monitor pursued the Lanterns for a short while, long enough for Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and the other Lanterns to learn of his return. Having this vital information, they then leave Qward.

Shortly after, the Sinestro Corps launched its attack on Earth. The Anti-Monitor traveled to the planet aboard New Warworld, and landed shortly thereafter, along with Sinestro. He was attacked by Sodam Yat and other members of the Green Lantern Corps, but the tyrant killed the two unnamed Lanterns and severely injured the Daxamite Lantern.

The Anti-Monitor began to siphon the positive matter of New York City to create his anti-matter waves. However, he was attacked by the Guardians of the Universe, angry at being impotent during his first war. The Anti-Monitor was able to counter the vicious attack, permanently disfiguring the face of Scar. John Stewart and Guy Gardner brought down New Warworld and the Yellow Central Power Battery, which were detonated next to the Anti-Monitor, and contained by a shield created by hundreds of Green Lanterns to contain the explosion; even this was not enough to kill him. A vengeful Superboy-Prime, seeing an opportunity to kill the now-weakened Anti-Monitor (out of revenge for destroying his homeworld of Earth-Prime) flew through the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s armour and hurled his disintegrating body into space.

The Anti-Monitor&#x27;s dying body crash-landed on a dark lifeless planet where a voice (later revealed to be Nekron) acknowledged him and told him to rise. Before he can escape, the Anti-Monitor is imprisoned in a Black Lantern Power Battery. Soon afterwards, the Guardian Scar, corrupted by the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s energies, dispatched the Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek to locate and recover the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s body, finding the drifting remains of his helmet on a trajectory pointing towards the restricted Space Sector 666.

===Blackest Night===

Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek find the Black Central Power Battery on the dead planet Ryut in Sector 666, and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet, killing them.

When the Black Central Power Battery is later brought to Earth, the Anti-Monitor stirs within, demanding to be let out, and begins draining Dove&#x27;s energy to escape. The Anti-Monitor is reanimated as a Black Lantern independent from Nekron&#x27;s control, his undead body beginning to emerge from the Black Lantern battery. Upon analysis, Green Lantern Guy Gardner ascertains that Nekron is using the Anti-Monitor as the energy source of the Black Lantern Power Battery to power the Black Lantern Corps. The Anti-Monitor is attacked by the various Lantern Corps just as he is about to free himself from the battery. Combining their energies, the various Lantern Corps use Dove as a human bullet shooting the Anti-Monitor through the head, with the Black Lantern battery recovering him to continue siphoning his energy.

The Anti-Monitor is eventually resurrected by a White Power Ring and breaks free of the battery, fighting Nekron in revenge for imprisoning him. Nekron then banishes the Anti-Monitor to the anti-matter universe.

===Brightest Day===

Later, the Anti-Monitor is confronted by the White Lantern Boston Brand. As Brand is forced by the White Ring to &quot;fight for his life&quot;, damaging the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s armor, the Anti-Monitor retaliates by firing a burst of anti-matter energy at Brand, who evades the blast. The Anti-Monitor resumes his duties in the anti-matter universe while Brand leaves. He also prevents Deathstorm from destroying the White Lantern Battery, and instead commands him to retrieve it. Firestorm ultimately defeats the two and reclaims the Battery.

===The New 52===
The Anti-Monitor was introduced in The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) in the final page of the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline. It is revealed to the reader as the being which destroyed Ultraman&#x27;s Krypton and Earth 3. As he is seen finishing off Earth 3, the Anti-Monitor declares &quot;Darkseid shall be mine.&quot;

The Anti-Monitor has found the Prime Earth by tracking Volthoom&#x27;s energy signature. He was also responsible for blinding Martian Manhunter&#x27;s Earth 3 counterpart by burning out his eyes and destroying one of his arms beyond repair.

When Metron confronted the Anti-Monitor amidst the ruins of Earth 3, it was revealed the Anti-Monitor was the former owner of Metron&#x27;s traveling device, the Mobius Chair, and is its namesake. He intends to make up for an unknown wrong he regrets, and to this end intends to kill Darkseid with the help of the latter&#x27;s daughter Grail.

With Grail&#x27;s help, the Anti-Monitor attacks the Justice League on Prime Earth while waiting for Darkseid as he was promised by Grail. It is eventually revealed that Mobius became what he is after attempting to peer into the origins of the anti-matter universe on Qward, similar to how Krona sought the origins of his positive-matter universe. While the White Light of the Life Equation was the origin of the positive universe, it is the Anti-Life Equation that serves as the foundation of the anti-matter universe, and Mobius released it from within the world of Qward, transforming him into the Anti-Monitor. With the Anti-Life Equation in his body, Anti-Monitor has the ability to enslave any living thing to his will. He uses this power to bind the Black Racer to the Flash, enslaving the New God and using him to kill Darkseid.

Having killed Darkseid, the Anti-Monitor envelops himself in an energy shell and separates from the Anti-Life Equation, which Grail claims. Shortly afterward, he emerged from his shell changed into a more human-looking form, once again Mobius, but still possessing vast power and legions of Shadow Demons. Superwoman and Wonder Woman attempt to subdue him together with their respective lassos: one compelling him to be truthful, the other to obey, but he defies and defeats both. Ultraman, re-empowered with kryptonite, engages Mobius, but is swiftly defeated and killed. Next, Mobius is attacked by Lex Luthor, now wielding the Omega Force formerly belonging to Darkseid, as well as an army of Shadow Demons. Even now, fighting Luthor as well as the Justice League and the Crime Syndicate, Mobius has the upper hand until Grail, Darkseid&#x27;s daughter, appears with Steve Trevor in tow. She has transferred the Anti-Life to him, making him into a new vessel for its power. Now basically a living weapon under Grail&#x27;s control, Trevor releases a tremendous blast of power against Mobius, reducing him to a skeleton.

===DC Rebirth===
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, the Monitors and the World Forger were created by the Super-Celestial Perpetua. The three assist the Justice League in battling her and temporarily combine into the Ultra-Monitor.

==Powers and abilities==
Anti-Monitor is one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the DC Universe. He is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known DC supervillain, having destroyed thousands of universes, if not an actual infinitude of them. He was powerful enough to kill Supergirl when she became distracted. He&#x27;s consumed thousands of positive-matter universes to increase his power and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse&#x27;s strongest heroes simultaneously. During the &quot;Blackest Night,&quot; the Anti-Monitor was reanimated as a Black Lantern. However, Nekron was unable to fully control him and thus was only able to subdue the Anti-Monitor to be used as a power source for the Black Lantern Corps&#x27; Central Battery, much in the same way the entity Ion is the power source for the Green Lanterns&#x27; battery.

The Anti-Monitor was also responsible for the death of Barry Allen, the hero better known as the Flash. After capturing Barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable, the Anti-Monitor created an anti-matter cannon that would destroy the then-five remaining Earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed. The cannon was destroyed by the Flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon&#x27;s power source into itself, causing it to explode and Barry to disintegrate.

In addition to possessing vast size (varying from about nine feet to hundreds of meters tall), vastly superhuman strength, extraordinary durability (by the end of the &quot;Crisis&quot; series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from Superman and even survived a blue star going supernova), the ability to project destructive bolts of energy, and greatly augmenting another being&#x27;s powers (as he did with Psycho-Pirate, whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle), the Anti-Monitor also possessed reality-warping abilities, which he displayed by removing Psycho-Pirate&#x27;s face. The Anti-Monitor also commanded an army of Qwardians and shadow demons and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting, merging, or destroying entire universes.

By far, his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself; once he fused with his anti-matter universe, he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes. In addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes, he also absorbed the energy of &quot;over one million worlds&quot; in his own anti-matter universe to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe. When Earth&#x27;s heroes followed him to the beginning of time, he then absorbed all of their power and energy; this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the Spectre. During his final battle in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #12, the Anti-Monitor maintained his power by &quot;feeding on&quot; a nearby star; and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near-death, he absorbed his own anti-matter demons to rejuvenate himself.

The Anti-Monitor is not immortal, but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti-matter universe exists; having been destroyed with an immense effort at the end of the Crisis, he was recreated by his universe, just as he had been formed originally. It is later revealed that the Monitors return to the sixth dimension to regenerate if they are destroyed.

The Anti-Monitor&#x27;s body is made of pure energy, causing his life force to continuously emanate as an energy aura. This forces him to wear armor to contain it.

<doc id="1132804" wikidata="Q6217306" url="?curid=1132804" title="John's first expedition to Ireland">
<text>In 1185, Prince John of England visited the island of Ireland as part of a campaign to secure the influence of the House of Plantagenet and the Crown of England, who planned to set up a Kingdom of Ireland within the Angevin Empire. John was himself a future king of England, the son of Henry II of England, and had been declared Lord of Ireland by his father at the Council of Oxford in 1177. Despite his own ambitions for the Kingdom of Jerusalem, John &quot;Lackland&quot; was sent west to Ireland by his father and landed at Waterford in April 1185.

The inexperienced young prince managed to offend the customs of the Irish Gaels who had met him diplomatically. John (who struggled to pay his own men) attempted to promise knights who traveled with him with Gaelic lands, which further irritated the natives. Aside from these concerns, he grew an intense dislike of the powerful Viceroy of Ireland, Hugh de Lacy, who held the Lordship of Meath, following his conquest of the Gaelic Kingdom of Meath. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Plantagenets were repeatedly concerned with Norman barons, nominally loyal to them, becoming too powerful in Ireland and this was the case with the successful (militarily and diplomatically) de Lacys.

John returned to England in December 1185 and complained bitterly to his father about the influence of de Lacy in Ireland. Much to the relief of the Plantagenets, the following year, de Lacy himself was assassinated at Durrow by an Irishman, Giolla Gan Mathiar Ó Maidhaigh. Plans were made for John to return to Ireland and the new Pope Urban III was more favourable than his predecessors to granting him the title King of Ireland. However, this was cancelled due to the death of John&#x27;s brother Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. John would later return to Ireland for a second time in 1210 while King of England, as part of a campaign to crush a rebellion by a section of Norman lords; this time he was far more successful.

==Preparation==
The subject of John going to Ireland first came into question under the reign of his father, Henry II, specifically with the Council of Oxford in 1177. This council dismissed William FitzAldelm as Deputy of Ireland and agreed to have John made King of Ireland. This would appear to have been a strategy of Henry II&#x27;s to divide his Angevin possessions between his four sons. The approval of Pope Alexander III was sought to have John crowned King of Ireland. Disagreements with first Alexander III and then his successor Pope Lucius III caused this to be delayed and instead John went as only Lord of Ireland.

In 1184 arrangements were made for John&#x27;s departure with the sending of John Cumin and Philip of Worcester to prepare the ground for John&#x27;s arrival. John arrived in Ireland in April 1185, landing at Waterford with around 300 knights and numerous foot soldiers and archers.

==Progress==

Upon his arrival in Ireland, John and his retinue were greeted by numerous unnamed Gaelic Irish leaders. It is said that upon seeing these strange long bearded Kings, John and his retinue laughed and pulled them about by their beards. Gerald of Wales said that the Irish then complained to their overlords — men such as Domhnall Mór Ó Briain — of how John was &quot;an ill-mannered child… from whom no good could be hoped&quot;. Aside from upsetting these rulers, John also at this time engaged in a vigorous program of extending land grants to trusted royal administrators such as Theobald Walter, William de Burgh, Gilbert Pipard and Bertram de Verdun as well as other minor land grants to lesser figures. Their Hiberno-Norman descendants, such as Walter&#x27;s Butler dynasty, would long remain influential.

During his stay in Ireland, John largely followed the route his father Henry II had taken in 1171–72, landing in Waterford and ending up in Dublin. John&#x27;s expedition founded several castles along the way, especially in Western Waterford and Southern Tipperary, and also established the foundations of administration and law which he later expanded upon in his second expedition in 1210.

==Departure==
John alienated many of the island&#x27;s resident elites (Irish and English), lost most of his army in battle or through desertion, and returned to England less than a year after arriving. Scholars have largely agreed that this was most likely to do with the presence of Hugh de Lacy but it is also likely that John ran out of money. It has been suggested that his departure was a setback in much broader plan to set up administrative structures in Ireland in order to control the unruly Barons via loyal, royalist forces such as Walter, De Burgh and De Verdon and that when De Lacy began to threaten his position, he escaped back to the safety of England.

Upon his departure, his father Henry granted the office of justiciar to the Baron John de Courcy, who had massive influence in Ulster. In 1186 Hugh De Lacy was assassinated by an Irishman and plans were made to send John back to Ireland. However, the death of his brother, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, in France cancelled these plans and John did not return to Ireland until his second expedition in 1210.

==Historiography==
The expedition has attracted much historical debate due to the lack of government records available and the subsequent reliance on sources such as the Irish Annals and the writings of Gerald.

<doc id="1132808" wikidata="Q1458041" url="?curid=1132808" title="Red Rose Speedway">
<text>Red Rose Speedway is the second studio album by the English-American rock band Wings, although credited to &quot;Paul McCartney and Wings&quot;. It was released through Apple Records on 4 May 1973, preceded by its lead single, the ballad &quot;My Love&quot;. By including McCartney&#x27;s name in the artist credit, the single and album broke with the tradition of Wings&#x27; previous records. The change was made in the belief that the public&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the band had been responsible for the weak commercial performance of the group&#x27;s 1971 debut album &quot;Wild Life&quot;.

Before recording the album, Wings recruited lead guitarist Henry McCullough and released their debut single, &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;, which was banned by the BBC for its political message. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1972 at five recording studios in London. The group also recorded the non-album singles &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;, &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the last of which was issued in June 1973. Originally planned as a double album, it was condensed into a single LP at the request of EMI. The company believed that the material was not of a sufficiently high standard and were mindful of the modest sales of &quot;Wild Life&quot; and Wings&#x27; first two singles. Members McCullough and Denny Laine later expressed disappointment in the choice of songs on the single album.

&quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; peaked at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in the US, while &quot;My Love&quot; topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although a commercial success, the album was given a mixed response by music critics, with several reviewers considering the songs to be inconsequential and mediocre. Decades later, it continues to receive mixed reviews. The album was reissued in 1987 and 1993 with bonus tracks and remastered in 2018 as part of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. The 2018 remaster includes the reconstructed double LP version of the album.

==Background==
In early 1972, McCartney decided to expand Wings to a five-piece band by adding another guitarist, Henry McCullough, and to begin touring with the group. The band briefly toured British universities in February. They played in small halls, often unannounced, to avoid the media scrutiny that came with performing at more established venues.

Despite not releasing an album in 1972, Wings issued three singles while preparing their follow-up to &quot;Wild Life&quot;: &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;, which was banned by the BBC for its political sentiments; &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;, based on the nursery rhyme; and &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;, which was banned by the BBC for drug references and sexually suggestive lyrics.

==Recording==
Recording for &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; began at Olympic Studios in London between 6–30 March 1972. It was initially planned as a double album, and McCartney decided to include some unreleased songs that had originally been recorded during the &quot;Ram&quot; sessions in 1971, before the formation of Wings. Two of those songs, &quot;Get on the Right Thing&quot; and &quot;Little Lamb Dragonfly&quot;, appeared on the final album. Sessions were held at Olympic Sound Studios in London, with Glyn Johns as producer. At the first session, McCartney asked Johns to think of him as &quot;the bass player in the band&quot; rather than as Paul McCartney, but then took offence when Johns duly treated him as an ordinary musician. Johns thought Wings were not a genuine band and not of the calibre of artist he usually worked with. Before long, according to author Howard Sounes, citing the producer&#x27;s recollection, Johns was reading a newspaper in the control room at Olympic as the group smoked marijuana and jammed aimlessly in the studio. On 17 April, Johns told the press that he had quit working on the album due to a &quot;disagreement&quot; with McCartney and that &quot;Now we have respect for each other.&quot;

Wings continued to record sporadically in between promoting their May 1972 single, &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;. After the band toured Europe in July and August, further recording sessions took place over October and November 1972 at Abbey Road Studios and Olympic. Morgan, Trident and Island were the other London studios where the band recorded that year.
The album was cut down to a single disc by McCartney – according to Henry McCullough, in an attempt to release a more commercial and less expensive record. The decision came about through EMI, however; in addition to believing that the material was not of a sufficiently high standard, the record company were mindful of the modest commercial performance of &quot;Wild Life&quot; and Wings&#x27; first two singles. The album ends with an 11-minute medley of the songs &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot;, &quot;Lazy Dynamite&quot;, &quot;Hands of Love&quot; and &quot;Power Cut&quot;, which was made in a similar style to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; medley. &quot;Power Cut&quot; was written during the 1972 miners&#x27; strike. Laine later expressed his disappointment that only a single album was issued, saying that in its original form, &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; was &quot;more of a showcase for the band&quot;. Among the omissions were his composition &quot;I Would Only Smile&quot;, and &quot;I Lie Around&quot;, on which Laine also sang the lead vocal. McCullough was similarly disappointed that several of McCartney&#x27;s rock-oriented tracks were cut from the running order, which favoured the more lightweight material from the sessions.

&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the title song to the James Bond film of the same name, was recorded during the sessions for &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;, but was initially released on the &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; soundtrack album. Laine included &quot;I Would Only Smile&quot; on his 1980 solo album &quot;Japanese Tears&quot;. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Little Girl&quot; was recorded during the sessions and later turned up as the B-side of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Put It There&quot; single in 1990. Among the other discarded tracks were &quot;Night Out&quot;, &quot;Jazz Street&quot;, &quot;Best Friend&quot;, &quot;Thank You Darling&quot;, &quot;The Mess&quot; (which McCartney introduced on stage as &quot;The Mess (I&#x27;m In)&quot; during Wings&#x27; live shows) and a cover version of Thomas Wayne&#x27;s song &quot;Tragedy&quot;.
==Artwork and packaging==
The packaging for &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; included a 12-page LP-size booklet inside a gatefold sleeve. The booklet featured photos from Wings&#x27; live shows taken by Joe Stevens (credited as Captain Snap) and others by Linda. The artwork for the inside gatefold and part of the booklet was designed by Eduardo Paolozzi, while pop artist Allen Jones contributed drawings, a painting and a photo collage, all variously depicting women, throughout the booklet. The graphics were designed by Gordon House. EMI agreed to pay for the lavish packaging, which was originally intended for the planned double album.

Breaking with the approach taken on the band&#x27;s previous releases, the artist credit included McCartney&#x27;s name rather than Wings alone, and instead of a group picture, only his face appears on the front cover. The image shows McCartney in front of a motorbike engine, with a red rose in his mouth, and was taken by Linda. The motorbike was transported from the United States especially for the shoot, which took place at the photographic studio of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; building in central London. The back cover featured the foot of a microphone stand and a bouquet of roses, with the image set inside a black background as if spotlit. In the space below this image was a Braille message to Stevie Wonder, reading &quot;We love ya baby&quot;.

The name change to &quot;Paul McCartney and Wings&quot; was made in the belief that the public&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the band had been responsible for the disappointing sales of &quot;Wild Life&quot;. In the US, Capitol Records were concerned that the positioning of the red rose on the front cover might make McCartney&#x27;s face unrecognisable to record buyers. Since no artist credit was included with this image, the company issued the album with a blue sticker in the top right-hand corner, identifying the band and listing the songs.

==Release==
The album was preceded by the March 1973 release of its lead single, &quot;My Love&quot; backed with &quot;The Mess&quot;. The latter song was recorded live during the band&#x27;s summer 1972 European tour. With Apple Records giving precedence to two Beatles compilation albums – &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1967–1970&quot; – &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; was not issued until 30 April 1973, in the United States, with the UK release following on 4 May. &quot;My Love&quot; peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary charts. It raised expectations for the album, which peaked at number 5 in the UK and went to number 1 in the US.

The original compact disc version, released by EMI&#x27;s Fame label on 5 October 1987, contained three bonus tracks: &quot;I Lie Around&quot;, &quot;Country Dreamer&quot; and &quot;The Mess (Live at The Hague)&quot;. An LP version of this CD edition was also released on the same day, omitting the bonus tracks. In 1993, &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD as part of &#x27;The Paul McCartney Collection&#x27; series, with &quot;C Moon&quot;, &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;, &quot;The Mess (Live at The Hague)&quot; (the B-side to &quot;My Love&quot;) and &quot;I Lie Around&quot; (the B-side to &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;) as bonus tracks. &quot;Country Dreamer&quot; was later added to the reissue &quot;Band on the Run&quot; from the same series.

In 2018, &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; was reissued as part of &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. The bonus content included the reconstructed original double LP version of the album featuring different mixes of &quot;Seaside Woman&quot; and &quot;I Would Only Smile&quot; as to those released on Linda McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wide Prairie&quot; and Denny Laine&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Tears&quot; respectively, the singles &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;, &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot; and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; with their respective b-sides, early and rough mixes of several songs as well as previously unreleased studio and live recordings, with the latter taken from the Wings Over Europe Tour. The songs &quot;Country Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Little Woman Love&quot; included on the reissue are the same versions that were previously released on the &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and &quot;Ram&quot; editions of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;.

There was a limited-edition half-speed mastered vinyl re-issue in the UK to mark the album’s 50th anniversary. This was released as part of Record Store Day on 22 April 2023.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; received a mixed response from contemporary music critics, many of whom dismissed its songs as mediocre. According to author and critic Bob Woffinden, writing in 1981, the album was an example of McCartney &quot;continu[ing] to exasperate his audience&quot; before he and Wings finally won respect with the late 1973 release of &quot;Band on the Run&quot;. John Pidgeon of &quot;Let It Rock&quot; found the side-two medley typical of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;lazy&quot; attitude to songwriting and said: &quot;&quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; sounds as if it was written after a big tea in front of the fire with carpet-slippered feet up; listening to it takes about as much as going ten rounds with a marshmallow fairy.&quot; Pidgeon concluded by likening the album to &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, ruing that McCartney appeared to have no one to challenge his judgment or &quot;kick his arse&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau derided McCartney&#x27;s reliance on &quot;aimless whimsy&quot; and described the work as &quot;Quite possibly the worst album ever made by a rock and roller of the first rank&quot;. In a 1977 interview, McCartney said that it typically took him a few months to listen to an album as a whole after its release; in the case of &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;, he said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand&quot; it. Joe Stevens, Wings&#x27; tour photographer in the early 1970s, recalled: &quot;I thought &quot;Red Rose&quot; was a disaster and so did everyone connected with it. Except Paul.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;the best effort yet from Paul since he left the Beatles&quot; and said that &quot;Paul creates the kind of melodic and lilting music that stays with the listener, and the lyrics reflect empathetic innocence.&quot;

According to author Michael Frontani, a generally favourable review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, written by musician Lenny Kaye, signified a turnaround from a publication that had been openly hostile towards McCartney since 1970. Frontani adds: &quot;While McCartney&#x27;s music would continue to be criticized by some commentators as vacuous and facile, Kaye&#x27;s review appears to mark the point where art of consequence was no longer required of McCartney by rock critics ...&quot; Ian Dove of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that McCartney&#x27;s work continued to pale beside that of his former bandmates John Lennon and George Harrison but deemed &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; his best album yet. Writing in the &quot;NME&quot;, Tony Tyler acknowledged that the album was &quot;lightweight&quot; and lacking in &quot;intellectual posture&quot; but added: &quot;with all the current heaviness and after-me-the-apocalypse brainstuds around, I for one am bloody pleased to discover a lightweight record that not only fails to alienate, but actually succeeds in impressing via good melodic structure, excellent playing and fine production.&quot;

Like the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; soon changed its opinion of &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; (1979), John Swenson said that the album displayed &quot;the worst aspects of McCartney as solo artist and band-leader&quot; and was &quot;rife with weak and sentimental drivel&quot;. In his 1977 book &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot;, Nicholas Schaffner described it as &quot;pleasingly plump music – charming, harmless, entertaining fluff ... a perfect background to lazy afternoons in the sun&quot;.

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; to be McCartney&#x27;s &quot;most disjointed album&quot; and &quot;deliberately slight ... in the way a snapshot album is important to a family yet glazes the eyes of any outside observer&quot;, but he adds: &quot;Work your way into the inner circle, and McCartney&#x27;s little flourishes are intoxicating – not just the melodies, but the facile production and offhand invention.&quot; Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez views it as &quot;a wildly uneven assortment of songs&quot;, of which the selections comprising the &quot;Abbey Road&quot;-style medley &quot;aren&#x27;t merely half-finished – they&#x27;re half-assed&quot;. While describing Glyn Johns&#x27; disparaging comments about the finished album as &quot;harsh&quot;, Howard Sounes writes: &quot;but in a record review one couldn&#x27;t award it more than three out of five stars.&quot;

* &quot;I Would Only Smile&quot; is a song featuring lead vocals from Denny Laine. It was eventually released on Laine&#x27;s solo album &quot;Japanese Tears&quot;.
* &quot;1882&quot; is a song which dates back to 1970 when it was first recorded as a demo around the time of the &quot;McCartney&quot; album. A home studio version was recorded in January 1972. A live recording from the same concert as &quot;The Mess&quot; (at The Hague on 21 August 1972) had studio overdubs added but was not released until 2018.

===Final double album track listing===
According to McCartney&#x27;s official website, his archive team found an updated double album track listing from 30 January 1973 that differed from Seiwell&#x27;s 1972 acetates. McCartney confirmed the updated track list as the one originally intended for release, saying, &quot;You know, this is actually how I recollect that double album.&quot;

In December 2018, McCartney officially released &quot;Red Rose Speedway: Reconstructed&quot;, a reconstructed version of its originally conceived &quot;double album&quot;, as a bonus CD in the Deluxe configuration of &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;, and separately as 2 LP vinyl.

The title of this song is featured in the inner sleeve artwork of the LP release of &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;.

===Other outtakes===
Other songs recorded during this period that did not make the original single-disc release include:
* &quot;Thank You Darling&quot; – A duet featuring Paul and Linda McCartney. Released as a bonus track on the &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; 2018 Deluxe remaster reissue.
* &quot;Soily&quot; – A live recording was mixed down but did not make the short list of the album. McCartney made other attempts at recording this song in studio including a version recording in his home studio in January 1972, and in McCartney&#x27;s &quot;studio performance&quot; film &quot;One Hand Clapping&quot;, which was eventually released as bonus track on the expanded remastered edition of &quot;Venus and Mars&quot;. This song was finally granted an official release when a version from McNichols Sports Arena in Denver appeared as a live recording on Wings&#x27; 1976 live album &quot;Wings over America&quot;.
* &quot;Henry&#x27;s Blues&quot; – A song featuring lead vocals and slide guitar from Wings guitarist Henry McCullough. A live recording was made during Wings&#x27; European tour of mid-1972, although this has never officially been released.

<text>William Fairfield Whiting (July 20, 1864August 31, 1936) was United States secretary of commerce from August 22, 1928, to March 4, 1929, during the last months of the administration of Calvin Coolidge.

== Early life and career ==
Whiting was born on July 20, 1864, in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He was the son of William Whiting II, a politician and businessman, and Anna Morgan (née Fairfield). He attended Amherst College and graduated in the class of 1896 alongside future Secretary of State Robert Lansing.

When Whiting&#x27;s father, who organized the Whiting Paper Company, became president of that business, William Fairfield Whiting became treasurer. When his father died, Whiting became president of the Whiting Paper Company and his brother Samuel Raynor Whiting became treasurer. He became a lifelong friend of future President Coolidge when Coolidge was mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts. Later, Whiting and Frank Stearns were the first two &quot;Coolidge Men&quot; who advocated their friend as a serious presidential candidate. At the 1920 Republican National Convention, Whiting voted for Coolidge for president on every ballot, the sole delegate to do so after Warren G. Harding had sewed up the votes to win the nomination.

After the 1928 Republican National Convention, Herbert Hoover resigned as Secretary of Commerce to focus on winning the presidential election. President Coolidge&#x27;s appointment of Whiting as Hoover&#x27;s successor surprised the Washington establishment. The position was predicted to go to Hoover&#x27;s preferred candidate, Dr. Julius Klein, the director of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce and Klein did not get the position when Hoover became president. Former Senator William Butler of Massachusetts turned down the post before Coolidge offered it to Whiting. His appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 11, 1928.

During his first press interview after his appointment, Whiting stated, &quot;My policies will be Mr. Hoover&#x27;s policies.&quot; As secretary, he headed President Coolidge&#x27;s delegation to the International Conference on Civil Aeronautics.

== Personal life ==
Whiting married the former Anne H. Chapin, daughter of Judge Edward Whitman Chapin, on October 19, 1892. The couple had four children: William Whiting, Edward Chapin Whiting, Fairfield Whiting and Ruth Whiting Fowler. Like his father, Whiting gained a reputation for raising Jersey cattle and poultry.

He died of a long illness at his Holyoke home on August 31, 1936. He is interred in Forestdale Cemetery in Holyoke along with his parents.

<text>Dulcinea is an album by Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1994. It is their fourth studio album with Columbia Records and the follow-up to their popular album &quot;Fear&quot;, which was released in 1991. Two songs from &quot;Dulcinea&quot; charted on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts: &quot;Fall Down&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Always Wrong&quot;. &quot;Dulcinea&quot; was RIAA Certified Gold on September 1, 1994, and Platinum on July 31, 1995.

The album&#x27;s name is a reference to the love interest in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; classic Spanish novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. At least two songs on the album allude to themes found in the novel. &quot;Crowing&quot; is a song about a person who does not know how to hold on to a lover. &quot;Windmills&quot; is a metaphorical song about how people spend much of their lives chasing absurd or impossible pursuits (the allusion being to a specific scene in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; where the title character uselessly attacks a windmill). The album&#x27;s artwork (illustrated by artist Jason Holley) also explores Cervantes&#x27; windmill metaphor, depicting the incongruence between the way things are and how people tend to perceive them.

&quot;Dulcinea&quot; also delves into some spiritual themes. &quot;Fly from Heaven&quot; is sung from the perspective of James, who is portrayed as Jesus&#x27;s literal brother and is upset by Paul&#x27;s manipulation of Jesus&#x27;s word. &quot;Begin&quot; and &quot;Reincarnation Song&quot; each explore questions about death and the afterlife.

Glen Phillips has said that &quot;Dulcinea&quot; is probably his favorite Toad album because they started to know what they were doing but were not overthinking things yet.

==Track listing==
Other tracks recorded during the album&#x27;s 1993 sessions included &quot;Crazy Life&quot; (later released on the &quot;Empire Records&quot; soundtrack and remixed by Tom Lord-Alge for &quot;Coil&quot;) as well as an alternate take of &quot;Reincarnation Song&quot; and two tracks, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;All Right&quot; which would be released on &quot;In Light Syrup&quot; the following year.
