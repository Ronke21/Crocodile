<text>is a Japanese voice actress and singer. She works for Aoni Production and was formerly a member of the voice actor unit Drops, which included fellow voice actor Akemi Kanda, Tomoko Kaneda, Mariko Kōda, and Ryōko Shiraishi. In high school in Fukuoka, she was head of the drama club and her ambition was to play male roles in the famous all-female Takarazuka Revue.

==Personal life and career==
Nonaka&#x27;s initial interest in voice acting started after watching &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. While self-proclaiming that she really would have preferred an acting career, but due to her height, as well as her interest in anime, she ultimately pursued voice acting after high school and graduated from the 21st batch of students from the Tokyo branch of Aoni&#x27;s Seiyū Coaching School.

In December 2009, she announced both on her blog and web radio, episode 30, that she has passed and acquired level 2 certification in aromatherapy. This was again announced while Nonaka was featured in the January 25, 2010 broadcast of Anison Plus.

Nonaka has a regular column, , in monthly voice magazine, . She has been featured three times in Anison Plus since the program started on July 7, 2008 (28-Jul-2008, January 26, 2009, January 25, 2010).

On August 20, 2017, she announced both on her blog and YouTube channel that she married someone outside the voice acting business on August 16, 2017.

<text>Horace Lawson Hunley (December 29, 1823 – October 15, 1863) was a Confederate marine engineer during the American Civil War. He developed early hand-powered submarines, the most famous of which was posthumously named for him, &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;.

== Biography == 
Hunley was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, to Louisa Harden Lawson and John Hunley. After relocating to New Orleans, Hunley studied law at the University of Louisiana and was admitted to the bar in 1849. He served in the Louisiana State Legislature and practiced law in New Orleans.

In response to the Union blockade of southern ports, the Confederate government offered bounties of up to $50,000 to anyone who sank a Union warship. In the summer of 1861, the Reverend Franklin Smith advocated Southern businessmen pursue submarine warfare, in writings to Southern newspapers. At this time Hunley joined engineer James R. McClintock and Baxter Watson in building the . In order to prevent her capture, the submarine had to be scuttled during trials in Lake Pontchartrain when New Orleans fell to Union forces in early 1862. The Pioneer would later be raised in 1868 and sold for scrap later that year.

Hunley, with McClintock and Watson, followed by building the . The second submarine was towed to Fort Morgan and attempted an attack on the Union blockade of Mobile. However, the submarine foundered in foul weather and sank in the mouth of Mobile Bay. without any casualties, as the crew was able to escape.

Hunley organized and arranged funding for a third submarine. The third boat was one-third financed by Hunley, one-third by E. C. Singer (an associate of Horace&#x27;s in the Confederate Secret Service and nephew of Isaac Singer, constructor of the sewing machine), and the remaining third to Singer associates R. W. Dunn and J. D. Breaman. Singer named the third vessel the &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; to honor Horace&#x27;s devotion and efforts to his sub projects. After a demonstration held on July 31, 1863 was successful by sinking an old barge the submarine was transported to Charleston harbor and presented to General P. G. T. Beauregard. Five men from the first crew of the &quot;Hunley&quot; died during early tests when she was accidentally swamped by the wake of a passing ship through her open hatches; four managed to escape. Another crew was recruited by Hunley who promised Beauregard a timely attempt. This crew included experienced crew members from earlier experiments. On October 15, 1863, Hunley took his turn at command during a routine exercise. The vessel again sank, and this time all eight crew members were killed, including Hunley himself. The vessel was later raised and used again in 1864 in the first successful sinking of an enemy vessel () by a submarine in naval history. The operation was also fateful for the &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; herself, which sank a third time, and for the second time losing all hands.

Upon recovery of the submarine and associated artifacts, it was discovered that the spar torpedo exploded while still attached to the spar. The system was designed to have the submarine ram the torpedo barb into the hull, back off to a safe distance, then activate the ignition via a long-length of rope. The submarine was never intended to be that close to the explosion and probably suffered significant structural damage, which contributed to her loss.

Horace Lawson Hunley was buried with full military honors at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8, 1863.

<text>Mina Anna Mazzini (born 25 March 1940) or Mina Anna Quaini (for the Swiss civil registry), known mononymously as Mina, is an Italian singer and actress. She was a staple of television variety shows and a dominant figure in Italian pop music from the 1960s to the mid-1970s, known for her three-octave vocal range, the agility of her soprano voice, and her image as an emancipated woman. 

In performance, Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and swing music, which made her the most versatile pop singer in Italian music. With over 150 million records sold worldwide, she is the best-selling Italian musical artist. Mina dominated the country&#x27;s charts for 15 years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity. She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts.

Mina&#x27;s TV appearances in 1959 were the first for a female rock and roll singer in Italy. Her loud syncopated singing earned her the nickname &quot;Queen of Screamers&quot;. The public also labelled her the &quot;Tigress of Cremona&quot; for her wild gestures and body shakes. When she turned to light pop tunes, Mina&#x27;s chart-toppers in West Germany in 1962 and Japan in 1964 earned her the title of the best international artist in these countries. Mina&#x27;s more refined sensual manner was introduced in 1960 with Gino Paoli&#x27;s ballad &quot;This World We Love In&quot;, which charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1961.

Mina was banned from TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois morals. After the ban, the public broadcasting service RAI tried to continue to prohibit her songs, which were forthright in dealing with subjects such as religion, smoking and sex. Mina&#x27;s cool act combined sex appeal with public smoking, dyed blonde hair, and shaved eyebrows to create a &quot;bad girl&quot; image.

Mina&#x27;s voice has distinctive timbre and great power. Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones. The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues, R&amp;B and soul music during the late 1960s, especially when she worked in collaboration with the singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti. Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills, particularly &quot;Brava&quot; by Bruno Canfora (1965) and the pseudo-serial &quot;Se telefonando&quot; by Ennio Morricone (1966). The latter song was covered by several performers abroad. Shirley Bassey carried Mina&#x27;s ballad &quot;Grande grande grande&quot; to charts in the U.S., UK, and other English-speaking countries in 1973. Mina&#x27;s easy listening duet &quot;Parole parole&quot; was turned into a worldwide hit by Dalida and Alain Delon in 1974. In 1982 her disco single &quot;Morirò per te&quot; entered in the Billboard Hot Dance/Disco Top 100. Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 but has continued to release popular albums and musical projects on a yearly basis to the present day.

==Early life==

Anna Maria Mazzini was born into a working-class family in Busto Arsizio, Lombardy. The family moved to work in Cremona in her childhood. She listened to American rock and roll and jazz records and was a frequent visitor at the Santa Tecla and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan, both known for promoting rock and roll. After finishing high school in 1958, she attended college where she majored in accounting.

==Career==

===Queen of Screamers (1958–1961)===

While on a summer holiday in Versilia on 8 August 1958, Mazzini gave an improvised performance of the song &quot;Un&#x27;anima tra le mani&quot; to amuse her family after a concert at the La Bussola night club. During the following nights, Sergio Bernardini, the owner of the club, held her back in her attempts to get back on stage.

In September, she started her solo career with the backing of the band Happy Boys. Her concert in September 1958, before an audience of 2,500 people at the Theatre of Rivarolo del Re, won enthusiastic approval from local critics. She soon signed with Davide Matalon, owner of the small record company Italdisc. Her first single, &quot;Non partir&quot;/&quot;Malatia&quot;, was produced under the stage name Mina for the Italian audience. Simultaneously, &quot;Be Bop A Lula&quot;/&quot;When&quot; was issued under the name &quot;Baby Gate&quot; for the international audience. &quot;Baby&quot; was chosen as a contrast to her 178 cm height (5 ft 10 in) – exceptionally tall for an Italian woman – and &quot;Gate&quot; as a tribute to The Golden Gate Quartet. In December, her performance at the Sei giorni della canzone festival of Milan was described by the &quot;La Notte&quot; newspaper as the &quot;birth of a star&quot;. It was Mina&#x27;s last performance with the Happy Boys, as her family refused to let her skip college for a scheduled tour of Turkey.

Less than a month after the breakup with her previous band, Mina co-founded a new group called Solitari, which consisted of a singer, a saxophonist, a pianist, a contrabassist, and a guitarist. Her first hit with the band featured Mina performing an extra-loud, syncopated version of the popular song &quot;Nessuno&quot; (&quot;Nobody&quot;), which she performed at the first rock festival in the Milan Ice Palace in February 1959. Performances of the song on the TV game shows &quot;Lascia o raddoppia?&quot; and &quot;Il musichiere&quot; on 1 March and 4 April were hailed by Italian critics. The starlet signed with Elio Gigante, an experienced artist manager. In the following years, he organized her performances in the grand ballrooms of Italy. Her first Italian 1 hit was the up-tempo &quot;Tintarella di luna&quot; (&quot;Moon Tan&quot;) in September 1959, which was performed in her first &quot;musicarello&quot; (musical comedy film), &quot;Juke box – Urli d&#x27;amore&quot;. In late 1959, Matalon had her drop the name Baby Gate in favour of Mina.

===Growing up (1960–1965)===

In 1960, Mina made her Festival della canzone italiana in Sanremo debut with two songs. She turned to slow emotional love songs for the first time. The song &quot;È vero&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s True&quot;) reached No. 4 on the Italian charts. Gino Paoli&#x27;s song &quot;Il cielo in una stanza&quot; (&quot;The Sky in a Room&quot;) marked the beginning of the young singer&#x27;s transformation from a rock and roll shrieker to a feminine inspiration for cantautori. The idea for the song &quot;Love can grow at any moment at any place&quot; had come to Paoli while lying on a bed and looking at the purple ceiling. The single topped the list of annual sales in Italy and reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as &quot;This World We Love In&quot;. Video performances of the song were included in the musicarellos &quot;Io bacio... tu baci&quot; and &quot;Appuntamento a Ischia&quot;, and in 1990, in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.
At the 1961 Sanremo Song Festival, Mina performed two songs. &quot;Io amo, tu ami&quot; (&quot;I Love, You Love&quot;) finished fourth and &quot;Le mille bolle blu&quot; (&quot;A Thousand Blue Bubbles&quot;) placed fifth. Disappointed with these results, Mina declared her intention of never performing at the Sanremo song festival again.

As her songs and movies were already popular abroad, Mina started to tour Spain and Japan, and performed on Venezuelan TV in 1961. Mina performed on Spanish TV and at the Paris Olympia hall at the beginning of 1962. The presentation of her German single &quot;Heißer Sand&quot; on 12 March 1962 on Peter Kraus&#x27;s TV show caused a boom of 40,000 record sales in ten days in Germany. The record went to No. 1 and spent over half the year on the German charts in 1962. Mina had six more singles on the German chart in the next two years. In a listeners&#x27; poll conducted in July 1962 in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking portion of Switzerland, Mina was voted the most popular singer in the world. In May 1962, she performed in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, her version of the mambo rhythm &quot;Moliendo cafe&quot; and the surf pop &quot;Renato&quot; peaked at No. 1 and No. 4 respectively on the Italian charts. &quot;L&#x27;eclisse twist&quot; appeared on the flip side of &quot;Renato&quot;, and was used on the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s feature film &quot;Eclipse&quot;.

Mina refused to cover up her relationship and resulting pregnancy with the married actor Corrado Pani, so her TV and radio career was interrupted by the Italian public broadcasting service RAI in 1963, as at the time divorce was not yet legal in Italy. Mina&#x27;s record sales were unaffected and due to public demand, RAI ended the ban. On 10 January 1964 she returned to the TV screen on the program &quot;La fiera dei sogni&quot;, and performed the song &quot;Città vuota&quot;, a cover of Gene McDaniels&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s a Lonely Town (Lonely Without You)&quot;, which was her first release on the RiFi label. Her next single, &quot;È l&#x27;uomo per me&quot;, a cover of Jody Miller&#x27;s &quot;He Walks Like a Man&quot;, became the biggest selling record of the year in Italy. Her new melodic manner was demonstrated again on the 11 December 1964 TV programme &quot;Il macchiettario&quot;, where she performed &quot;Io sono quel che sono&quot; (&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;). A reminder of her previous adolescent image, her single &quot;Suna ni kieta namida&quot; (&quot;Tears Disappear in the Sand&quot;), sung in Japanese, peaked at No. 1 on the Japanese singles chart and earned Mina the title of Best International Artist in Japan.

The first episode of the &quot;Studio Uno&quot; live Saturday night series showcased Mina&#x27;s new blond look with shaved eyebrows. The shows included the brooding songs &quot;Un bacio è troppo poco&quot; (&quot;One Kiss is Not Enough&quot;) and &quot;Un anno d&#x27;amore&quot; (&quot;A Year of Love&quot;), a cover of Nino Ferrer&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;est irreparable&quot;. In the same series she performed &quot;Brava&quot; (&quot;Good&quot;), a rhythmic jazz number specially written by Bruno Canfora to demonstrate Mina&#x27;s vocal range and performing skills. Her &quot;Studio Uno&quot; album topped the Italian chart that year. Her recordings of 1965 included the scatting performance of &quot;Spirale Waltz&quot;, the theme song for the film &quot;The 10th Victim&quot;.

===Independence (1966–1968)===

Maurizio Costanzo and Ghigo De Chiara wrote the lyrics of &quot;Se telefonando&quot; (&quot;If Over the Phone&quot;) as the theme for the TV program &quot;Aria condizionata&quot; in spring 1966. The lyrics were composed in a dark, Hal David mode. The serialist composer Ennio Morricone was asked to compose the music. Mina and the three songwriters met in an RAI rehearsal room at Via Teulada, Rome. Morricone started to repeat a short musical theme of just three notes (by his term a &quot;micro-cell&quot;) on an upright piano. He had copied the snippet of melody from the siren of a police car in Marseilles. After a few bars, Mina grabbed the lyrics sheet and started to sing as if she had known the tune before. Composed in this way, &quot;Se telefonando&quot; is a pop song with eight transitions of tonality that builds tension throughout the chorus. Morricone&#x27;s arrangement featured a sophisticated combination of melodic trumpet lines, Hal Blaine-style drumming, a string set, a 1960s Europop female choir, and intense subsonic-sounding trombones.

&quot;Se telefonando&quot; was presented in May 1966 in a &quot;Studio Uno&quot; episode and in August the same year at &quot;Aria condizionata&quot;. The single peaked at No. 11 on the Italian chart and was 53rd in the annual list of sales. The album &quot;Studio Uno 66&quot; featured the song as one of the standout tracks along with &quot;Ta-ra-ta-ta&quot; and &quot;Una casa in cima al mondo&quot;. It was the fifth biggest-selling album of the year in Italy.
In 1966, Mina started working with the Swiss Broadcasting Service and the Orchestra Radiosa in Lugano. She founded the independent record label PDU in collaboration with her father. The first record issued under the label was &quot;Dedicato a mio padre&quot; (Dedicated to My Father). Mina&#x27;s growing interest in Brazilian music resulted in &quot;La banda&quot; (&quot;The Band&quot;), a Chico Buarque song, which reached No. 2 in Italy. Mina continued to perform on Italian TV, and presented &quot;Zum zum zum&quot; on the spring 1967 variety series &quot;Sabato sera&quot;, accompanied by the NATO naval band. The series also included &quot;La coppia più bella del mondo&quot; (&quot;The Most Beautiful Couple in the World&quot;), a duet with Adriano Celentano. The title of the song &quot;Sono come tu mi vuoi&quot; (&quot;I Am, as You Want Me to Be&quot;) was taken from Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s play &quot;Come tu mi vuoi&quot;. The lyrics talk about the manic attention of the press on an artist&#x27;s private life. Another hit from &quot;Sabato sera&quot; was &quot;L&#x27;immensità&quot; (&quot;Immensity&quot;), which was re-scored by Augusto Martelli and released as &quot;La inmensidad&quot; in Spain and Latin American countries.

RAI broadcast the third episode of &quot;Senza Rete&quot; (&quot;Without Safety Net&quot;) live on 18 July 1968 from the Auditorio A of the corporation&#x27;s regional headquarters in Naples. The program presented Mina&#x27;s homage to Luigi Tenco, who had recently died. She turned his song &quot;Se stasera sono qui&quot; (&quot;If I Stay Here Tonight&quot;) into a rigorous piece of soul music in the score of Pino Calvi. She celebrated the 10th anniversary of her career with a concert at La Bussola, backed by the Orchestra Augusto Martelli. The concert was recorded and issued as &quot;Mina alla Bussola dal vivo&quot;.

&quot;Canzonissima 1968&quot; was a Saturday night prime-time variety show that aired on Rai Uno from September 1968 to January 1969. It was hosted by Mina, Walter Chiari and Paolo Panelli. The orchestrations were scored by the conductors Bruno Canfora and Augusto Martelli. &quot;Sacumdì Sacumdà&quot;, Mina&#x27;s talking and laughing version of Carlos Imperial&#x27;s bossa nova &quot;Nem Vem Que Não Tem&quot;, narrowly escaped a ban by RAI because of its irreverent lyrics. The song was performed as part of a musical fantasy, back to back with &quot;Quelli che hanno un cuore&quot;, her intense version of &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;. Another interpretation of a Dionne Warwick song was &quot;La voce del silenzio&quot; (&quot;Silent Voices&quot;) by Paolo Limiti and Elio Isola, presented in a live session during the show. &quot;Niente di niente&quot; (&quot;Nothing at All&quot;) was her version of the Delfonics&#x27; &quot;Break Your Promise&quot;. The series also included the songs &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;La musica è finita&quot; (&quot;The Music is Over&quot;) and the elegant &quot;Un colpo al cuore&quot; (&quot;Heart Attack&quot;). &quot;Un colpo al cuore&quot; ended up as No. 68 on the best-selling singles chart for that year in Italy. Each show was closed by Mina singing &quot;Vorrei che fosse amore&quot; (&quot;Wish It Was Love&quot;), a piece of atmospheric music by Bruno Canfora that was No. 50 on the best-selling singles chart for 1968 in Italy. A selection of songs from the series were issued as the album &quot;Canzonissima &#x27;68&quot;.

===Mogol-Battisti (1969–1973)===
After a break of three months, Mina returned and recorded the song &quot;Non credere&quot; (&quot;Disbelieve&quot;), composed by Luigi Clausetti and Pietro Soffici, with lyrics by Mogol, in April. The single became the third biggest-selling record of the year in Italy. Mogol and his fellow composer Lucio Battisti, along with the Premiata Forneria Marconi on backup instrumentals, worked with Mina on several songs as a result of the success of &quot;Non credere&quot;. The team produced a set of songs including &quot;Io e te da soli&quot; (&quot;You and Me Alone&quot;), &quot;Insieme&quot; (&quot;Together&quot;), &quot;Amor mio&quot; (&quot;Love of Mine&quot;), &quot;Io vivrò senza te&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll Live without You&quot;). &quot; One of the first introductions of the new repertoire was the &quot;Senza Rete&quot; live televised concert from the Auditorio A in Naples on 20 January 1970. The material provided by Mogol-Battisti was the core for five albums. Among them, &quot;...bugiardo più che mai... più incosciente che mai...&quot; was Mina&#x27;s first independent album to reach No. 1 of the weekly Italian charts and was the biggest-selling album of 1969 in Italy. &quot;...quando tu mi spiavi in cima a un batticuore...&quot; was seventh on the annual record chart of 1970. &quot;Del mio meglio...&quot; (&quot;My Best...&quot;) was second in 1971. &quot;Mina&quot; was the biggest seller of 1972. The latter two albums were recorded during a break from live performances to give birth to her daughter Benedetta.

Mina&#x27;s comeback took place at RAI&#x27;s variety series &quot;Teatro 10&quot; in the spring of 1972. One of the highlights of the series was a selection of Battisti&#x27;s songs performed in duet with the composer. The shows also included &quot;Balada para mi muerte&quot; (&quot;Ode to My Death&quot;), a nuevo tango duet with Ástor Piazzolla at the bandoneón, backed by the Argentinian group Conjunto 9. &quot;Grande grande grande&quot;, arranged by Pino Presti, was the second biggest-selling single of the year in Italy. The successes pushed Enrico Riccardi to take inspiration from Battisti&#x27;s style in Riccardi&#x27;s composition &quot;Fiume azzurro&quot;, which earned another place in the top 100 of annual record sales in Italy.

The final number of the eight &quot;Teatro 10&quot; episodes was &quot;Parole parole&quot; (&quot;Words Words&quot;), a duet with Alberto Lupo. The song is an easy listening dialogue between Mina&#x27;s singing and Lupo&#x27;s declamation. The lyrics&#x27; theme is hollow words. These intertwine the lady&#x27;s lamentation of the end of love and the lies she has to hear with the male protagonist&#x27;s recitation. In the dialogue she scoffs at the compliments he gives her, calling them &quot;parole&quot; – just words. The single was released in April 1972 and topped the Italian charts. It was covered by numerous Italian and French duets.

Mina said she would be retiring from public appearances after an exclusive concert at the La Bussola Club on 16 September. Thousands of people turned up at the nightclub&#x27;s doorstep. Gianni Ferrio&#x27;s Orchestra featured Gianni Basso on tenor saxophone and Oscar Valdambrini on trumpet.

Mina lost her husband Virgilio Crocco in a car accident in 1973. She continued her career with the top Italian chart hits &quot;E poi...&quot; (&quot;And Then...&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;importante è finire&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Important to Finish&quot;). She recorded the theme song &quot;Fa presto, fa piano&quot; (&quot;Works Quickly, Works Quietly&quot;) for the film &quot;La sculacciata&quot;, issued in 1974.

===Since 1974===
Mina&#x27;s last live TV appearance was the final episode of the &quot;Milleluci&quot; series on 16 March 1974. Mina was the hostess of the series alongside Raffaella Carrà. During the series, she explored different musical styles in the songs &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot;, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, &quot;Night and Day&quot;, and &quot;Someday (You&#x27;ll Want Me to Want You)&quot;. After &quot;Non gioco più&quot; (&quot;The Game Is Over&quot;), a blues duet with the harmonica player Toots Thielemans, Mina announced her withdrawal from public performances.

Her last appearance on TV was her performance of &quot;Ancora ancora ancora&quot;. The video was the final number of the &quot;Mille e una luce&quot; show on 1 July 1978. Her last concert appearances, a series of thirteen fully booked concerts at La Bussola in 1978, were cut short due to her illness. Mina gave her last public performance on 23 August 1978 at the Bussoladomani theatre. It was recorded and issued as &quot;Mina Live &#x27;78&quot;.
Mina continued to release albums on a yearly basis with her son Massimiliano Pani as the producer. Between 1972 and 1995, she published a double album each year. From 1973, her LPs and CDs have been characterized by artistic motifs of the designers Luciano Tallarini, Gianni Ronco and the photographer Mauro Balletti. From the mid-1980s, the design of the album covers was trusted to Balletti alone. All of Mina&#x27;s records under the PDU label have reached the Italian Top 100. A large part of her work has consisted of covering well-known songs; she has dedicated tribute albums to The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Renato Zero, Domenico Modugno, Lucio Battisti, Enzo Jannacci, the Neapolitan song, and sacred music. Starting in 1989, all of her records included the jazzy piano playing of Danilo Rea.

After leaving the stage, her greatest chart successes have been duets. In 1985, &quot;Questione di feeling&quot;, a duet with Riccardo Cocciante, was the 13th biggest-selling single of the year in Italy and became an evergreen (as a hit song is called in Europe). The duet album &quot;Mina Celentano&quot;, recorded with Adriano Celentano, was the biggest-selling album of 1998 in Italy. The break in Mina&#x27;s TV appearances lasted until 2001 when she released footage of her recording sessions. The videos were broadcast over the Wind internet site on 30 March. This resulted in millions of visits to the site on that night, and additional millions on the following days. The footage was released as the DVD &quot;Mina in Studio&quot;.

After that event, Mina&#x27;s singles started to chart in Italy again. The track &quot;Succhiando l&#x27;uva&quot; (2002), written for her by Zucchero, peaked at No. 3 on the chart. Mina&#x27;s cover of &quot;Don&#x27;t call me baby (Can&#x27;t take my eyes off you)&quot; (2003) reached No. 4 in Italy. The single &quot;Alibi&quot; (2007) reached No. 6 in Italy. The triple CD &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; reached No. 1 on the Italian charts. So did &quot;Olio&quot; (1999), &quot;Veleno&quot; (2002), &quot;Bula Bula&quot; (2005), &quot;Todavía&quot; (2007), &quot;Le migliori&quot; (2016) and &quot;Maeba&quot; (2018). Mina&#x27;s later releases included duets with Mick Hucknall, Fabrizio De André, Piero Pelù, Adriano Celentano, Lucio Dalla, Joan Manuel Serrat, Chico Buarque, Miguel Bosé, Tiziano Ferro, Giorgia and Seal. In recent years, Mina has been writing a weekly column on the front page of &quot;La Stampa&quot; (from 2000 until 2011) and a page in the Italian edition of the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, where she answered fan letters (from 2003 until 2015).

Mina continues to publish gold selling albums to the present. She alternates pop albums with jazz-arranged projects and other styles and keeps surprising with new musical collaborations. Meanwhile, her voice and songs are omnipresent in radio and TV commercials, theme tunes of sports programs, talent shows (where they sing classics), tribute shows, new covers, and even as samples in the recordings of other artists (for example rapper Mondo Marcio). Although not appearing live, she opened and closed the 2009 national Sanremo Music Festival with her version of the Puccini opera aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot;. Her voice was also present, singing a cover in videos by main sponsor TIM, at the Festival editions of 2017 and 2018. 
The latter year, on the final night, a digitized version of Mina was shown performing Another Day of Sun, a cover of the song from the La La Land musical soundtrack, as a three-dimensional hologram of spaceship commander Mina, being projected onto the Ariston festival stage.

In 2016, there was quite a hype about a second album of Mina and Celentano together: &quot;Le Migliori&quot;. It became the best-selling album of the year in Italy. In 2018, Mina&#x27;s new album &quot;MAEBA&quot; in 2018 debuted again at the Number 1 spot of the Italian albums and vinyls hitparade.

In 2023 a surprising intergenerational duet of Blanco (20) and Mina (83), &quot;Un briciolo di allegria&quot;, made number 1 in the Italian hitparade for 5 consecutive weeks.

On April 20, 2024, the triple live album &quot;Mina Live at the Bussola 1968-1978&quot; was packaged and released by Warner Music Italy, consisting of a limited and numbered edition box containing the 4 LPs recorded live by Mina, the only live performances of her career, realized at the Bussola in Marina di Pietrasanta in the years 1968 (&quot;Mina alla Bussola dal vivo&quot;) 1972 (&quot;Dalla Bussola&quot;) and 1978 (&quot;Mina Live &#x27;78&quot;). 

==Musical style and public image==

===Voice===

Mina is a soprano with great agility and a range of three octaves. Swingy and anti-melodic in her early years (&quot;Tintarella di luna&quot;, 1959), her singing later acquired high dramatic tones. Louis Armstrong famously declared her to be &quot;the greatest white singer in the world&quot;.

===Queen of Screamers===

Caught up in the wave of rock and roll sweeping across Italy in 1958, Mina listened to American records, and she was a frequent visitor at the Derby Club, the Santa Tecla, and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan, which promoted rock and roll music. Mina&#x27;s repertoire at the beginning of her career included clumsy imitations of British and American rock and jazz songs, while her extra-loud and syncopated version of the song &quot;Nessuno&quot; showcased her excellent sense of rhythm. Earlier in 1958, Domenico Modugno had caused astonishment by raising his hands in the air during his performance of &quot;Nel blu dipinto di blu&quot; (&quot;Volare&quot;). In Mina&#x27;s first TV appearances, she further broke with tradition by shaking her head, hands, and hips to the rhythm. The writer Edoardo Sanguineti recalled the Italian public&#x27;s first encounter with the enthusiastic singer as &quot;for many people a memorable experience, ... a revelation.&quot; TV host Mario Riva named her one of the (&quot;screamers&quot;), for her distinctive timbre and power. Later, the public called Mina &quot;the Queen of Screamers&quot;. Her extravagant gestures earned her another nickname – &quot;the Tigress of Cremona&quot; ().

===Grown up===

Mina introduced her new sensual manner in her presentation of the ballad &quot;Il cielo in una stanza&quot; in 1960. Three years later, her love affair with Corrado Pani challenged the moral foundations of Italy, a country where divorce was illegal and single motherhood was considered shameful. Thus, her non-conformist choices represented the emancipation of women in Italy, which did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois virtues prevalent at the time. The subsequent ban from performing on Italian TV and radio channels further developed Mina&#x27;s image as an independent bad girl, which she emphasized with her choice of song themes. An example was her performance of &quot;Sacumdì Sacumdà&quot; on air after RAI had expressed their displeasure with the song&#x27;s lyrics about a girl&#x27;s encounter with the Devil. Other songs that RAI initially banned as immoral were &quot;Ta-ra-ta-ta&quot; (dealing forthrightly with smoking), &quot;La canzone di Marinella&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;importante è finire&quot; (alluding to sex without love). Mina&#x27;s cool act featured sex appeal, public smoking, dyed blonde hair, shaved eyebrows, and heavy use of eye make-up.

The main themes of Mina&#x27;s songs were distressing love stories. Her style was to interpret them in a highly dramatic way by using gestures and body language to bring the story alive. Mina&#x27;s performance was typically characterised by expressive intensity, subtle variations, and original phrasing. The music critic Gherardo Gentili has noted her interpretive skills as such: &quot;By Mina, a word became the word, a note became the note.&quot;

To demonstrate Mina&#x27;s vocal range, the composer Bruno Canfora penned the song &quot;Brava&quot;, and Ennio Morricone wrote &quot;Se telefonando&quot; with numerous transitions of tonality. More songs were composed exclusively for Mina and arranged for RAI&#x27;s all-star orchestras for performance on the TV variety series &quot;Studio uno&quot;, &quot;Sabato sera&quot;, &quot;Canzonissima&quot; and &quot;Teatro 10&quot;. Mina (alongside Carmen Villani) pioneered by combining classic Italian pop and swing music with features of blues, R&amp;B and soul music, particularly in the songs &quot;Se stasera sono qui&quot; and &quot;Deborah&quot;. She helped to incorporate new styles into Italian pop music, including nuevo tango, as seen in her duet &quot;Balada para mi muerte&quot; with Ástor Piazzolla.

===Mogol-Battisti===

When she altered her musical style in 1969, Mina changed her hairdo from short and straight to long blonde curls, and started to wear a black minidress. Mogol&#x27;s and Lucio Battisti&#x27;s first songs, particularly &quot;Insieme&quot; and &quot;Io e te da soli&quot;, showcased Mina&#x27;s blues and soul skills. Around the time of their collaboration, Mina turned toward middle-of-the-road pop. Battisti&#x27;s melodies were sophisticated and had a complex chord sequence. The songs were characterized by frequent changes of rhythm, pauses, and dialogues between the voice and the orchestra. Another characterizing feature was an instrumental introduction without a rhythmic base.

===Mina Latina===

A fan of bossa nova, Mina recorded in Spanish and Portuguese from the start of her career and currently enjoys a fan base in Spain and Latin America. The Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has used Mina&#x27;s songs in his movie soundtracks. In 2001, Mina published the compilation album &quot;Colección Latina&quot;. It includes standards in Spanish, as well as Spanish covers of her originals. In 2003, the musical &quot;Mina... che cosa sei?&quot; based on Mina&#x27;s songs was staged in Argentina, starring Elena Roger. It was nominated for four &quot;Premios ACE&quot; in 2003 and 2004, among them &quot;Best Musical&quot;, and won the &quot;Premio Clarín&quot; for Best Musical. In 2007, Mina published &quot;Todavía&quot;, an album in Spanish and Portuguese, which reached No. 36 on the Spanish charts and No. 1 on the Italian charts. It included duets with Joan Manuel Serrat, Miguel Bosé, Diego Torres, Chico Buarque, and Diego El Cigala.

===Legacy===

Mina has scored 77 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts. She is the only artist to land an album at the top of the Italian charts in each of the six decades from the start of record keeping in 1965. She released an album every year during 1958–2003, and continues to release new albums and singles.

President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi presented her with the Second Class of the Italian Order of Merit on 1 June 2001.

British singer Dusty Springfield referenced Mina in performance.

A number of Mina&#x27;s songs were turned into hits by singers in other languages:

* The first of these was &quot;Piano&quot;, scored by Matt Monro as &quot;Softly, as I Leave You&quot;, which reached No. 10 in the UK Top 40. In 1964, the song reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the version by Frank Sinatra.

* A year later, Dalida and Alain Delon recorded &quot;Paroles, paroles&quot;, the French version of &quot;Parole parole&quot; and made it an international hit. It became one of the most recognizable French songs in the world.
* Mexican icon José José recorded the Spanish version of the hit &quot;Sono, come tu mi vuoi&quot;, entitled &quot;Soy como quieras tú&quot;.

* Irish dance music artist Róisín Murphy covered Mina&#x27;s ″Non credere″ and ′Ancora, ancora, ancora″ (remixed into extended tracks by UK and Italian DJs) in her 2014 EP &quot;Mi Senti&quot;, a reinterpretation of pop classic hits by various Italian music artists.

To celebrate Mina&#x27;s 70th anniversary, the &quot;la Repubblica&quot; newspaper held a reader&#x27;s poll to pick Mina&#x27;s best song of all time. In a vote of 30,000 participants, &quot;Se telefonando&quot; emerged at the top of the list.

==Personal life==
In her early teens, Mina was a competitive swimmer for the Canottieri Baldesio sports club in Cremona, attended by the elite of the Cremonese bourgeoisie at the time. At 16 she met her first boyfriend, a fullback for the U.S. Cremonese football club, at the swimming pool.

Mina fell in love with actor Corrado Pani in 1962. Their relationship shocked Italian audiences as he was already married although separated from his wife. Their son, Massimiliano Pani, was born on 18 April 1963. Owing to Mina&#x27;s refusal to hide the relationship, the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels. As her record sales were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended.
Mina&#x27;s brother Alfredo Mazzini died in a car accident in 1965. A year later she and her father moved to Lugano, Switzerland. Mina&#x27;s intimate relationships, however, remained in Italy, as she had a brief affair with the actor Walter Chiari. A later relationship with actor Gian Maria Volonté ended after she found out about Volonté&#x27;s affair with an actress. Mina&#x27;s great love of the late 1960s, with whom she had a relationship that lasted three years and almost led to marriage, was the composer Augusto Martelli. Her second spouse was Virgilio Crocco, a journalist for &quot;Il Messaggero&quot;, in 1970. As a result of their marriage, her legal name was changed to Anna Maria Mazzini Crocco. Their daughter Benedetta Mazzini was born on 11 November 1971. Crocco died in a car accident in 1973.

Mina became engaged to her last husband, cardiologist Eugenio Quaini, in 1981. They were married on 10 January 2006 in Lugano. She obtained Swiss citizenship in 1989. As required in that country, she took on her husband&#x27;s last name and her legal name became Anna Maria Quaini. For the public, the Italian civil registry and its Italian documents, however, she still addresses herself as Mina Mazzini, also seen in her website&#x27;s domain name.

<doc id="1130768" wikidata="Q3108310" url="?curid=1130768" title="Reedy Glacier">
<text>The Reedy Glacier () is a major glacier in Antarctica, over long and wide, descending from the polar plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Michigan Plateau and Wisconsin Range in the Transantarctic Mountains.
It marks the limits of the Queen Maud Mountains on the west and the Horlick Mountains on the east.
==Naming==
The Reedy Glacier was mapped by United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy (USN) air photos, 1960–64. 
It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Rear Admiral James R. Reedy, USN, Commander, U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, from November 1962 until April 1965.

==Topography and ice flow==

The Reedy Glacier is the most southern large glacier that drains ice through the Transantarctic mountains from the Antarctic Plateau.
It drains about of the polar plateau, with its catchment extending from south of the South Pole.
It flows from the edge of the polar plateau at to become the Mercer Ice Stream at in the southeast corner of the Ross Sea embayment.
It is the only large glacier that flows from the Transantarctic mountains into grounded ice in the Ross Sea, although during the Last Glacial Maximum other glaciers also flowed into grounded ice.

The Reedy Glacier is almost wide at its head and its mouth.
It narrows to in the central section, where for it flows past cliffs that rise above the glacier surface.
The Wisconsin Range to the east and the Queen Maud Mountains to the west holds peaks that rise over above sea level.
At the head of the glacier the ice surface is almost above sea level, while at its mouth it is above sea level.
Ice thickness is up to .

At the Quartz Hills the center-line velocity is per year.
Elsewhere center-line velocities range from per year.
Kansas Glacier is the largest tributary, joining the Reedy Glacier from its head.
Other tributaries contribute little to the volume of ice flow.
After entering the Ross Ice Shelf the Reedy Glacier becomes the Mercer Ice Stream.
In the past it has been at least thicker than at present.

During the last 290 Ma the glacier has expanded at least six times, each time less than before, with the last expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the ice sheet was up to thicker than today.
The glacier flows into the ice sheet about behind the Ross Sea grounding line, so the flow and thickness of the glacier are, at least in part, controlled by the damming effest of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Reedy Glacier was considerably thicker than it is today at several times in the mid to late Cenozoic.
For at least five million years the changes of thickness correlate with changes in thickness of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

==Course==

From the polar plateau the Reedy Glacier flows north past the Spear Nunatak, Strickland Nunatak and Savage Nunatak. It passes the Metavolcanic Mountain to the east and the Watson Escarpment to the west.
Past the Gratton Nunatak it is joined from the east by the McCarthy Glacier and the Olentangy Glacier.
It is joined from the west by the Wotkyns Glacier and the Gardiner Glacier flowing from the Watson Escarpment.
It flows northwest past the Wisconsin Range to the east, from which it receives the Norfolk Glacier and the Hueneme Glacier.
Past the Quartz Hills to the west it receives the Colorado Glacier.

Below Blubaugh Nunatak the Reedy Glacier is joined from the west by the large Kansas Glacier.
The Kansas Glacier originates on the Stanford Plateau and is fed by the Johns Glacier from the south and Alaska Canyon from the north.
The Reedy Glacier continues north past the Ford Nunataks to the east and Abbey Nunatak and Penrod Nunatak to the west.
Near its termination it is joined from the east by the Horlick Ice Stream just after that has joined the Davisville Glacier, which has been joined by the Quonset Glacier from the east further upstream.
The Reedy Glacier glacier flows northwest past Racine Nunatak and Cohen Nunatak to the west before entering the Ross Ice Shelf.

Except where otherwise stated, the features of the Reedy Glacier glacier region, described below, were mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960–64.

<text>is a Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; television series. The twelfth installment in the Kamen Rider Series, it was a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei, and it was shown on TV Asahi from February 3, 2002 to January 19, 2003. The series marked the franchise&#x27;s switch from Columbia Music Entertainment to Avex Group, which continues to produce music for the series today. The series aired along with &quot;Ninpu Sentai Hurricanger&quot;. It is the first series debuted an animal, knights, cards, and battle royal motif.

In 2008, &quot;Ryuki&quot; was adapted into the American television series &quot;Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight&quot;, the second American adaptation of a Kamen Rider series after Saban&#x27;s &quot;Masked Rider&quot; (1995).

==Story==

Thirteen were created for thirteen Kamen Riders. They form contracts with monsters from the mysterious , a parallel dimension opposite to our own in which only the Kamen Riders can exist. The Riders draw on their monsters&#x27; strength in exchange for feeding them the life force of the creatures they destroy. The creator of the has only one rule: that there can be only one Kamen Rider. The others must be killed, and the sole victor will be granted a single wish, which leads to a conflict known as the Rider War.

All over the city, innocent people are being mysteriously abducted, never to be seen again. During his investigations of these incidents, Shinji Kido – an intern at the online news service ORE Journal – discovers one of the Advent Card decks at an apartment where every reflective surface has been covered by a newspaper. He is soon sucked into the Mirror World, discovering the terrifying truth behind the disappearances: people are being pulled through mirrors by the monsters of the Mirror World so that they may feed. He is about to be killed by a powerful dragon named Dragreder when he is saved by a Kamen Rider Knight: Ren Akiyama. Ren seeks to win the Rider War at all costs. He works with a young woman named Yui Kanzaki, who seeks her missing brother: the master of the Rider War, Shiro Kanzaki. Seeing Ren&#x27;s strength, Shinji enters the Rider War, not for the prize, but so that he may protect innocent people from the threat of the Mirror World, and stop the senseless fighting between the Kamen Riders. With Dragreder as his contract monster, he becomes Kamen Rider Ryuki.

He discovers that some people cannot be saved and that he must sometimes fight to stop the fighting. The extent to which he must go if he wants his deepest wish to come true, and the sacrifices that he must make. In the very end, there can be only one Kamen Rider.

==Episodes==
==Movies and specials==

===&quot;13 Riders&quot;===
 was written by Toshiki Inoue and directed by Ryuta Tasaki. It features the debut of the thirteenth Kamen Rider in the continuity of &quot;Ryuki&quot;: Verde. This special was first broadcast on TV Asahi on September 19, 2002. It was later released on DVD on July 21, 2003. The DVD also featured information on the characters, an interview with actor Arthur Kuroda, and an &quot;interview&quot; with some of the characters.

This television special is an alternate telling of the &quot;Kamen Rider Ryuki&quot; story. Shinji Kido&#x27;s life, working as an employee at ORE Journal, takes a sharp turn after being pulled into the Mirror World by a Mispider. Luckily, he was saved by a Kamen Rider, Ryuki (Koichi Sakakibara, portrayed by Keiichi Wada). However, Sakakibara could no longer go on due to the severity of his injuries and passed his Card Deck to Shinji, allowing him to become the next Ryuki and defeat the monster. After meeting Yui Kanzaki and Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider Knight), Shinji learns about the conditions of the Rider War, as well as of the other Riders participating. Unable to allow such a game of death to exist like his Rider predecessor, Shinji sets out to convince all the Riders to end the senseless fighting and put an end to the War. His pleas fall upon deaf ears as just about every other Rider (except for the already-defeated Riders Raia and Scissors) sets out to hunt down Shinji and his eventual reluctant ally, Ren. Eventually, Shinji&#x27;s deck is destroyed and Ren dies, after passing on the deck for Kamen Rider Knight to Shinji. The special has two different endings which were voted on by the viewers via phone at the time of the initial airing: the voted-for-air ending (in which Shinji faces the surviving Riders on his own) and the alternate ending (a resetting of the Rider War).

===&quot;Episode Final&quot;===

 is a film released on August 17, 2002, doubled-billed with &quot;Ninpu Sentai Hurricaneger: Shushutto the Movie&quot;. The film is an alternate ending to the series, taking place after the events of episode 46. With only six Riders remaining in the Rider War; Ryuki (Shinji Kido), Knight (Ren Akiyama), Zolda (Shuichi Kitaoka), Ouja (Takeshi Asakura), and Femme (Miho Kirishima); Shiro Kanzaki alerts them to quickly settle the Rider War within three days. One of them must win and become the last survivor before the sixth surviving Rider reveals himself. Amidst the impending chaos of the fight between the Riders, Shinji discovers an unbelievable truth about the relationship between Yui Kanzaki and the Mirror World, as well as discovering the existence of his Mirror World doppelganger, Kamen Rider Ryuga.

===&quot;Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito&quot;===
 is the &quot;Ryuki&quot; Hyper Battle Video. It features Shinji Kido having a dream where he joins up with Kamen Riders Knight, Zolda, and Ouja, all of whom who are acting out-of-character, to fight an evil Kamen Rider Agito in the Mirror World. They are soon joined by the real Kamen Rider Agito who helps defeat his evil doppelganger.

<doc id="1130771" wikidata="Q6132527" url="?curid=1130771" title="James Delamere Lafferty">
<text>James Delamere Lafferty (April 28, 1849 – July 29, 1920) was a Canadian physician and politician. Lafferty served as Registrar for the Northwest Territories Medical Ordinance regulator to professionalize the practice of medicine. he was actively involved in establishing the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and the Canadian Medical Association&#x27;s Alberta Division, which was later known as the Alberta Medical Association. He served one term as the fifth mayor of Calgary from January 1890 to January 1891.

==Early life==

Lafferty was born in Perth, Canada West, in 1849 and attended local schools. He had seven brothers and four sisters. Three of his brothers became physicians, and his brother Tom became a lawyer and moved to Calgary, Alberta.

==Education==
He worked as deputy registrar of titles in Kingston to finance his further education. He graduated from Queen&#x27;s University medical school in 1871. Lafferty practised medicine for a year in Perth before becoming a senior resident at Ward Island hospital (later Bellevue Hospital) in New York City and at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Lafferty next took a post-graduate course at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, England.

==Medical career==

In 1873, he set up practice in Pembroke, Ontario; later that same year, he married Jessie P. Grant. From 1877 to 1880, Lafferty also operated a drug store in Pembroke. In 1880, he was named associate coroner for Renfrew County. The following year, Lafferty was offered the position of chief surgeon for the eastern division of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, later that year. Lafferty and his family had moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, by 1885 and then moved on to Calgary in December 1885.

In Calgary, Lafferty took on the contracts to provide medical services for the CPR mainline and for the nearby Indian reservation.

In 1889, he was a founding member of the North West Territories Medical Association and, in the following year, was elected to the medical council for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North West Territories.

Lafferty served as NWT Medical Ordinance regulator, which included the geographic regions that became the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

When Alberta became a province of the Dominion of Canada, with the passage of the July 20, 1905, Alberta Act in the Canadian parliament, all existing societies or associations that regulated the medical profession, dentistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and others, under the Northwest Territories (NWT) Medical Ordinance, were dissolved. A new entity was formed with the passage of the May 9, 1906&quot;Alberta Medical Profession Act&quot; , in the newly formed Alberta provincial legislature. Lafferty, who had drafted the medical acts for both newly formed provinces—Alberta and Saskatchewan, organized the 1906 meeting which formed the Alberta Medical Association. Later that same year, he organized the first meeting of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. Lafferty served as Registrar-Treasurer for the college until 1911. From 1907 to 1910, he served as chair of the Provincial Board of Health. He also served as first president of the Calgary Medical Society. Lafferty retired from the practice of medicine in 1909 but served as a hospital inspector from 1909 until 1918 (or possibly later).

==Banking career==
Lafferty was also involved in the operation of a chain of private banks in western Canada known as the Lafferty and Smith Banks in partnership with Frederick G. Smith. He left that partnership in 1889 and formed the Lafferty and Moore Bank. In 1893, Lafferty and Moore was acquired by the Bank of Montreal.

==Political career in federal politics==

Lafferty ran for the Liberal Party in the provisional district of Alberta in the 1887 Canadian federal election, but lost out to Conservative Donald Watson Davis.

==Personal life==

Three of Lafferty&#x27;s brothers became physicians, and his brother Tom became a lawyer and moved to Calgary, Alberta. His brother Alan Marshall Lafferty (1861–1947) was a medical practitioner in Lethbridge, Alberta. His sister Janet Lafferty Short (1847–1934) married the lawyer, James Short of Calgary.

Lafferty died on July 29, 1920, in Calgary, aged 71. His July 20, 1920, obituary in the &quot;Calgary Albertan&quot;, described him as an &quot;ebullient, effervescent, entertaining pro westerner [he was] a shrewd judge of character with great drive and persuasion.&quot; He was survived by his three of four sons, Guy, Geoffrey, and Heber and by his two sisters. His son Francis (Frank) predeceased him in 1919.

<doc id="1130781" wikidata="Q1796029" url="?curid=1130781" title="Queen Maud Mountains">
<text>The Queen Maud Mountains () are a major group of mountains, ranges and subordinate features of the Transantarctic Mountains, lying between the Beardmore and Reedy Glaciers and including the area from the head of the Ross Ice Shelf to the Antarctic Plateau in Antarctica. Captain Roald Amundsen and his South Pole party ascended Axel Heiberg Glacier near the central part of this group in November 1911, naming these mountains for the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales.
==Exploration and naming==
Elevations bordering the Beardmore Glacier, at the western extremity of these mountains, were observed by the British expeditions led by Ernest Shackleton (1907–09) and Robert Falcon Scott (1910-13), but the mountains as a whole were mapped by several American expeditions led by Richard Evelyn Byrd (1930s and 1940s), and United States Antarctic Program (USARP) and New Zealand Antarctic Research Program (NZARP) expeditions from the 1950s through the 1970s.

==Appearance==
The &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1960) describes the Queen Maud Range as follows: &quot;From the Beardmore Glacier the horst trends east-southeastward an undetermined distance. The Prince Olaf Mountains stretch from the Beardmore Glacier to the Liv Glacier. Near a large glacier trends southward. Eastward of 175°E. the escarpment is fronted for about 50 miles by high gneissic foothills which are fronted by an expansive piedmont inundating the lower heights. In about the Shackleton Glacier (Wade Glacier), a vast straight-walled glacier about 12 miles wide, extends southward to the polar plateau.

&quot;At this point the scarp appears broken by a transverse fault which displaces the horst northward to Mount Wade (Mount Bush), a beacon sandstone massif rising to at least 14,000 feet above sea level, dominating the eastern flank of this remarkable valley glacier.
Eastward of Mount Wade stand the Fisher Mountains, which form the western flank of the Liv Glacier. Bush Mountains, lying just eastward of the mouth of Shackleton Glacier, are a group of ragged foothills rising to a height of 4,000 feet.

&quot;Viewed from northward the Queen Maud Range presents a vast array of low-lying peaks which increase progressively in height to the southward where, about 15 miles from the shelf ice, stand great tabular mountain masses, 13,000 feet high, having a sharply defined fault-line scarp on the northern side. The northern foothills are dark-colored gneisses and schists with veins of granite and quartz. These foothills show marked glacierization with well-developed cirques and aretes. The high tabular mountains of the horst, are regular and even in outline, presenting broad domes with precipitous fronts to the north showing the granite structure capped by a series of horizontally bedded sandstone with intruded dolerite sills.&quot;

==Glaciers==
The Queen Maud Mountains are crossed by several major glaciers that flow from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf, and divide the mountains.
*The Beardmore Glacier is one of the largest valley glaciers in the world, being long and having a width of . It descends about from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf and is bordered by the Commonwealth Range on the eastern side and the Queen Alexandra Range on the western.
*The Shackleton Glacier is a major glacier, over long and from wide, descending from the Antarctic Plateau from the vicinity of Roberts Massif and flowing north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf between Mount Speed and Waldron Spurs.
*The Liv Glacier is a steep valley glacier, long, emerging from the Antarctic Plateau just southeast of Barnum Peak and draining north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter Ross Ice Shelf between Mayer Crags and the Duncan Mountains.
*The Amundsen Glacier is a major Antarctic glacier, about wide and long. It originates on the Antarctic Plateau where it drains the area to the south and west of Nilsen Plateau, then descends through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf just west of the MacDonald Nunataks.
*The Scott Glacier is a major glacier, long, that drains the East Antarctic Ice Sheet through the Queen Maud Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf.
*The Reedy Glacier is a major glacier, over long and wide, descending from the polar plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Michigan Plateau and Wisconsin Range. It marks the limits of the Queen Maud Mountains on the west and the Horlick Mountains on the east.

Other glaciers with outlets on the Ross Ice Shelf include
*Canyon Glacier, Giovinco Ice Piedmont, Perez Glacier, Good Glacier, Ramsey Glacier, Erickson Glacier and Kosco Glacier between the Beardmore and Shackleton glaciers.
*Barrett Glacier, Gough Glacier, Le Couteur Glacier, Morris Glacier between the Shackleton and Liv glaciers.
*Strom Glacier, Axel Heiberg Glacier, Bowman Glacier between the Liv and Amundsen glaciers.
*Goodale Glacier, Koerwitz Glacier between the Amundsen and Scott glaciers.
*Leverett Glacier between the Scott and Reedy glaciers.
These glaciers in turn are generally fed by smaller valley glaciers.

==Mountain ranges==
===Beardmore–Shackleton===

Mountain groups or ranges between Beardmore Glacier and Shackleton Glacier include:

*Commonwealth Range, a north-south trending range of rugged mountains, long. The range borders the eastern side of Beardmore Glacier from Keltie Glacier to the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Separation Range, the northeastern branch of the Commonwealth Range. The branch starts at about 84°20&#x27;S, and forms two chains of mountains separated by Hood Glacier. The Separation Range, about long, terminates to the north at the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Hughes Range, a high massive north–south trending mountain range in Antarctica, surmounted by six prominent summits, of which Mount Kaplan at is the highest. The range is located east of Canyon Glacier and extends from the confluence of Brandau Glacier and Keltie Glacier in the south, to the Giovinco Ice Piedmont in the north.
*Supporters Range, a rugged range long, bordering the eastern side of Mill Glacier, from Keltie Glacier in the north to Mill Stream Glacier in the south.
*Dominion Range, a broad mountain range, about long, forming a prominent salient at the juncture of the Beardmore and Mill glaciers.
*Barton Mountains, a group of mountains located south of the Commonwealth Range and the Hughes Range and bounded by Keltie Glacier, Brandau Glacier, Leigh Hunt Glacier, and Snakeskin Glacier.
*Grosvenor Mountains, a group of widely scattered mountains and nunataks rising above the polar plateau east of the head of Mill Glacier, extending from Mount Pratt in the north to the Mount Raymond area in the south, and from Otway Massif in the northwest to Larkman Nunatak in the southeast.
*Bush Mountains, a series of rugged elevations at the heads of the Ramsey and Kosco glaciers. The Bush Mountains extend from Mount Weir in the west to Anderson Heights overlooking Shackleton Glacier in the east.
*Erb Range, a rugged mountain range rising to between Kosco Glacier and Shackleton Glacier, and extending north from Anderson Heights to Mount Speed on the west side of the Ross Ice Shelf.

===Shackleton–Liv===

Mountain groups or ranges between Shackleton Glacier and Liv Glacier include:

*Prince Olav Mountains, a mountain group stretching from Shackleton Glacier to Liv Glacier at the head of the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Gabbro Hills, a group of rugged ridges and coastal hills which border Ross Ice Shelf between Barrett Glacier and Gough Glacier and extend south to Ropebrake Pass.
*Lillie Range extends northward from the Prince Olav Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf. Mounts Hall, Daniel, Krebs and Mason are in the range.
*Roberts Massif, a remarkable snow-free massif at the head of Shackleton Glacier. It rises to over and is about in area. 
*Cumulus Hills, several groups of largely barren hills. Divided by the Logie Glacier, they are bounded by Shackleton Glacier on the west, McGregor Glacier on the north and Zaneveld Glacier on the south.

===Liv–Amundsen===
Mountain groups or ranges between Liv Glacier and Amundsen Glacier include:

*Duncan Mountains, a group of rugged coastal foothills, about long, extending from the mouth of Liv Glacier to the mouth of Strom Glacier.
*Herbert Range, a range extending from the edge of the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Axel Heiberg Glacier and Strom Glacier.
*Quarles Range, a high and rugged range extending from the polar plateau between Cooper Glacier and Bowman Glacier and terminating near the edge of Ross Ice Shelf.

===Amundsen–Scott===

Mountain groups or ranges between Amundsen Glacier and Scott Glacier include:

*Hays Mountains, a large group of mountains and peaks surmounting the divide between the lower portions of Amundsen Glacier and Scott Glacier and extending from the vicinity of Mount Thorne on the northwest to Mount Dietz on the southeast.
*Medina Peaks, rugged, mainly ice-free, peaks surmounting a ridge long, extending north along the east side of Goodale Glacier to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Karo Hills, rounded, ice-free foothills extending for along the west side of the terminus of Scott Glacier, from Mount Salisbury north-northwest to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf. 
*Nilsen Plateau, a rugged, ice-covered plateau in Antarctica. When including Fram Mesa, the plateau is about long and wide, rising to high between the upper reaches of the Amundsen and Scott glaciers.
*Rawson Mountains, a crescent-shaped range of tabular, ice-covered mountains including Fuller Dome, Mount Wyatt and Mount Verlautz, standing southeast of Nilsen Plateau and extending southeast for to the west side of Scott Glacier.

===Scott–Reedy===

Mountain groups or ranges between Scott Glacier and Reedy Glacier include:
*Watson Escarpment, a major escarpment trending northward along the east margin of Scott Glacier, then eastward to Reedy Glacier where it turns southward along the glacier&#x27;s west side. Somewhat arcuate, the escarpment is nearly long, rises above sea level, and above the adjacent terrain.
*Gothic Mountains, a group of mountains, long, located west of Watson Escarpment and bounded by Scott Glacier, Albanus Glacier, and Griffith Glacier.
*La Gorce Mountains, a group of mountains, long, standing between the tributary Robison Glacier and Klein Glacier at the east side of the upper reaches of the Scott Glacier.
*Tapley Mountains, a range of mountains fronting on the eastern side of the Scott Glacier, extending eastward for between Leverett Glacier and Albanus Glacier.
*Harold Byrd Mountains, a group of exposed mountains and nunataks which extend in an east–west direction between the lower part of Leverett Glacier and the head of the Ross Ice Shelf.
*Bender Mountains, a small group of mountains southwest of the Berry Peaks, between the southeast edge of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Watson Escarpment.

===Other features===
*The Quartz Hills is an arcuate cluster of largely ice-free hills and peaks found immediately south of Colorado Glacier along the west side of Reedy Glacier.
*The Caloplaca Hills are a distinctive group of rock hills including Mount Carmer and Heathcock Peak, lying east of the Watson Escarpment on the west side of Reedy Glacier.
*Titan Dome is a large ice dome on the polar plateau, trending east–west and rising to between the Queen Maud Mountains and the South Pole. The dome was first crossed by the sledge parties of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Scott on their journeys toward the South Pole, and was described as a major snow ridge. It was delineated by the SPRI-NFS-TUD airborne radio echo sounding program, 1967–79, and named after the Cambridge University (U.K.) Titan computer, which was used to process all the early radio echo sounding data for this part of Antarctica.

===Early life, family and career===
Austin was born in Dunedin on 1 April 1933, and was educated at St Dominic&#x27;s College, Dunedin, and Sacred Heart College, Christchurch. She studied at Canterbury University College and Christchurch Teachers&#x27; College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1953 and a Diploma of Teaching in 1954.

She was also a member of the Educational Administration Society and was its president for three years.

In 1955, she married John Austin, and the couple went on to have three children.

===Political career===


She was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election as the MP for Yaldhurst, an electorate in western Christchurch. After Labour&#x27;s re-election at the , Austin was elected her party&#x27;s Senior Whip following Michael Cullen&#x27;s elevation to cabinet.

During her time in Parliament, Austin served as a Minister of Research and Development, Internal Affairs and of Arts, Culture and Heritage at the end of the Fourth Labour Government. In November 1990, when Labour was in opposition, she was appointed as Shadow Minister of Education by Labour leader Mike Moore.

She held the Yaldhurst seat for the Labour Party until 1995 when the seat was abolished, in preparation for the changeover to MMP, and she joined with six other MPs to found the centrist United New Zealand Party. Like all United New Zealand MPs (but Peter Dunne), Austin was not re-elected in the 1996 election; Austin stood in the new electorate where she came third.

In the 1997 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Austin was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services. In the 2008 New Year Honours, she was elevated to Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the community.

<doc id="1130788" wikidata="Q155135" url="?curid=1130788" title="Axel Heiberg Glacier">
<text>The Axel Heiberg Glacier () in Antarctica is a valley glacier, long, descending from the high elevations of the Antarctic Plateau into the Ross Ice Shelf (nearly at sea level) between the Herbert Range and Mount Don Pedro Christophersen in the Queen Maud Mountains.

==Discovery and name==
The glacier was discovered in November 1911 by the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen, and named by him for Consul Axel Heiberg, a Norwegian businessman and patron of science who contributed to numerous Norwegian polar expeditions.

Amundsen used this glacier as his route up onto the polar plateau during his successful expedition to the South Pole.

==Characteristics==

According to &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1960), &quot;The Axel Heiberg Glacier, about 6 miles wide and 27 miles long, lies southeastward of the Fridtjof Nansen massif. It trends in a northeast.–southwest direction and is steep, reaching an elevation of 10,920 feet at the southem portal. It was discovered and traversed by Amundsen in rovember 1911, on his journey to the south pole.&quot;

Unlike the big “outlet” glaciers such as the Beardmore, Shackleton and Liv, the Axel Heiberg is in effect an alpine glacier, cut off from the polar plateau by a dolerite rim and fed entirely from the uncharacteristically heavy snow falling within its own catchment. It falls over 2,700 m (9,000 ft) in 32 km (20 mi), most of it over 11 km (7 mi).

==Course==
The Axel Heiberg Glacier forms below the polar plateau below Helland Hansen Shoulder to the north, Mount Engelstad in the center and Mount Wilhelm Christopherson and Butchers Spur to the south. Mount Don Pedro Christophersen defines the eastern end of Butchers spur, and separates the Axel Heiberg Glacier from Cooper Glacier. In its upper reach the glacier descends through the Amundsen Icefall, then flows west to the south of the Herbert Range. It is joined by the Cooper Glacier from the south, and by the Sargent Glacier from the north, to the east of Bell Peak. It turns north and flows into the Ross Ice Shelf to the east of the Strom Glacier and west of the Bowman Glacier and Amundsen Glacier.

==Features==

===Helland Hansen Shoulder===

A mainly ice-covered ridge which extends southward from the west portion of Mount Fridtjof Nansen and overlooks the northern side of the head of Axel Heiberg Glacier. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Armundsen and named by him for Prof. B. Helland Hansen, of the University of Oslo, Norway.

===Mount Engelstad===

A rounded snow-covered summit rising from the edge of the polar plateau at the head of Axel Heiberg Glacier, about midway between Helland-Hansen Shoulder and Mount Wilhelm Christophersen. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen and named by him for Captain Ole Engelstad, of the Norwegian Navy, who had been selected as second in command of the Fram to carry the expedition to Antarctica, but who was killed in a scientific experiment preceding its departure.

===Mount Wilhelm Christophersen===

A mound-shaped, ice-covered knob which rises from the edge of the polar plateau south of Mount Engelstad and overlooks the south side of the head of Axel Heiberg Glacier. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen and named by him for Wilhelm Christophersen, Norwegian diplomat and Minister at Buenos Aires at that time.

===Butchers Spur===

A high ice-covered spur which descends southwestward from Mount Don Pedro Christophersen to the polar plateau. This feature on the south margin of the Queen Maud Mountains is the location of Roald Amundsen&#x27;s &quot;Butcher Shop.&quot; It was here in November 1911 that his party slaughtered their excess sledge dogs, consuming portions themselves and permitting the remaining sledge dogs a feast, prior to making the final dash to the South Pole, which was reached December 14.

===Mount Don Pedro Christophersen===

A massive, largely ice-covered, gabled mountain high, surmounting the divide between the heads of Axel Heiberg and Cooper Glaciers. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen, who named it for one of the expedition&#x27;s chief supporters who lived in Buenos Aires.

===Cooper Glacier===

A tributary glacier, long, flowing northeast between Butchers Spur and Quarles Range to enter the south side of Axel Heiberg Glacier. It was discovered by Rear Admiral Byrd on several plane flights to the Queen Maud Mountains in November 1929, and named by him for Kent Cooper, an official of the Associated Press.

===Amundsen Icefall===

A steep and turbulent icefall where the Axel Heiberg Glacier descends from the polar plateau between Mount Fridtjof Nansen and Mount Don Pedro Christophersen. It was named by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE (1961-62) for Captain Roald Amundsen, who ascended Axel Heiberg Glacier enroute to the South Pole in 1911.

===Sargent Glacier===

A steep-walled tributary glacier, flowing southeast from the Herbert Range to enter Axel Heiberg Glacier just southeast of Bell Peak. Probably first seen by Roald Amundsen&#x27;s polar party in 1911, the glacier was mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30. It was named by US-ACAN for Howard H. Sargent III who made ionospheric studies at the South Pole Station in 1964.

<text>Pauline Mona Gardiner (née Wayman, born 27 September 1947) is a former New Zealand Member of Parliament, first for the New Zealand National Party and then for United New Zealand. She was married to soldier, writer and public servant Wira Gardiner.

==Early life==
Pauline Wayman was born in Christchurch in 1947. She received her education at New Brighton School (1952–1960) and Christchurch West High School (1961–1963). After school, she joined the New Zealand Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps (NZWRAC) for three years.

==Member of Parliament==


Gardiner contested the electorate for National in the against Fran Wilde, the incumbent of the Labour Party. On election night, Gardiner had a lead, but Wilde won when the special votes had been counted.

Wilde was elected Mayor of Wellington in 1992, and her resignation from parliament caused the 1992 Wellington Central by-election. Gardiner again contested the seat, but was beaten by Labour&#x27;s Chris Laidlaw.

In the , Gardiner in turn defeated Laidlaw in the new Wellington-Karori electorate. This was the only seat Labour lost at this election, which allowed National to govern with a majority of one. In 1995, Gardiner left the National Party to join six other MPs in the establishment of centrist party United New Zealand. Like all United MPs but Peter Dunne, she was defeated in the 1996 election; she contested the Wellington Central electorate, where she came fourth.

In 1998 she ran for United in the Taranaki-King Country by election following the resignation of Jim Bolger. She came a distant ninth place with less than 1% of the votes.

==Interest outside parliament==
Gardiner is most well known for her campaign against drug abuse. She is particularly critical of New Zealand&#x27;s harm minimisation policy, which was introduced in 1990, and during this time, the country has become one of the highest users of drugs.

==Family==
Gardiner has three children by her former husband Wira Gardiner. Their daughter Ainsley Gardiner is a film producer who became well known through her 2010 film &quot;Boy&quot;. She now lives in Whakatāne. She is now married to real estate agent Gordon Fridge.

<doc id="1130794" wikidata="Q7728628" url="?curid=1130794" title="The Daily Cardinal">
<text>The Daily Cardinal is a student newspaper that serves the University of Wisconsin–Madison community. One of the oldest student newspapers in the country, it began publishing on Monday, April 4, 1892. The newspaper is financially and editorially independent of the university.

The &quot;Cardinal&quot;&#x27;s motto, printed at the bottom of every front page and taken from an 1894 declaration by the university&#x27;s board of regents, is &quot;...the great state University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.&quot;

==Circulation==
&quot;The Daily Cardinal&quot; is published Thursdays during the academic year in a tabloid print format and maintains an independent website with fresh content each day. The print press run of 10,000 is distributed throughout the campus community. Nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate student volunteers and employees work at the paper. Its daily sections include News, Opinion, Arts and Sports, and its weekly sections are Features, Life &amp; Style and Science.

==Awards==
In 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2022, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was the recipient of the Society of Professional Journalists Mark of Excellence award for best daily college newspaper of the year in Region 6 (Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin).

Since 2000, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; has won 64 awards from the SPJ and Associated Collegiate Press, 58 regional and 6 national.

The &quot;Cardinal&quot; won first place for General Excellence in the Wisconsin Newspaper Association&#x27;s 2022 and 2023 Collegiate Better Newspaper Contest, generally considered the top honors for the respective competitions.

==History==

===The beginning of sifting and winnowing: 1892-1932===
&quot;The Daily Cardinal&quot; was founded as a rival to the monthly student paper &quot;Aegis&quot;, by Monroe, Wisconsin native William Wesley Young, the brother of cartoonist Art Young and the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s first journalism student, and William Saucerman. Four hundred free copies of the paper were made available to Wisconsin students on April 4, 1892. For the first month of production, Young rode his horse down State Street to the offices of the &quot;Madison Democrat&quot;, which printed the &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s name was decided by a vote of university students, &quot;Cardinal&quot; representing one of the school colors.

During the early years of the paper, the founder of the university&#x27;s journalism school, Willard G. Bleyer, was a reporter and editor as an undergraduate. The experience was formative in his views on the teaching of journalism.

While against World War I at its outset, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; developed favorable attitudes toward the war, especially following the November 11, 1918, armistice. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; did not initially support the Second World War either, but later added special military sections to the paper to help coordinate the war effort.

===Making an impression: 1932-1960===
During the Great Depression the &quot;Cardinal&quot; first earned its reputation for radicalism. Disagreeing with a policy of mandatory military training for male undergraduates to prepare for the impending World War II and running a letter to the editor signed by Junior Women discussing free love led U.S. Senate nominee John B. Chapple to declare that the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was controlled by &quot;Reds, Atheists and free love advocates&quot;. The UW Board of Regents revoked the &quot;Cardinal&quot;’s title as &quot;official University newspaper&quot; following this discourse and threatened to close the paper down until a compromise added a faculty member and a regent to the &quot;Cardinal&quot; board.

In 1940, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; moved out of its office east of Memorial Union to a building on University Avenue, on the land where Vilas Communication Hall sits today. In 1956, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; board donated the land to the university in an agreement stipulating that the &quot;Cardinal&quot; would enjoy rent-free tenancy in the new building. The &quot;Cardinal&quot;&#x27;s offices remain in Vilas Hall today.

In 1942, &quot;Cardinal&quot; founder Young returned to edit the paper for a day. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote on the occasion, &quot;Despite annual changes in student staffs, a few college newspapers in the country have acquired a definite character. One of these is the &quot;Daily Cardinal&quot; of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The Cardinal is proud of its liberal tradition. Because it fights cleanly and with a sense of responsibility, its youthful passion for righteousness does not burn less brightly.&quot;

===A radical reputation: 1960-1988===
During the 1960s, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; developed a national reputation for its vehement far-left politics. They were the first American newspaper to send reporters to Cuba, and after two of the &quot;Cardinal&quot;’s editors and two other campus radicals carried out the largest and most destructive car bomb attack until that point in United States history, the Sterling Hall bombing, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; ran editorials endorsing the bombing. They ran several editorials strongly protesting the Vietnam War and supporting causes of Civil Rights. In 1969, a group of conservative UW students, frustrated by the &quot;Cardinal&quot;’s unrelenting liberalism, founded &quot;The Badger Herald&quot; as a right-wing alternative. Until recently, UW-Madison was one of few American universities with competing daily news publications, though starting in 2014 that competition largely shifted online with the Cardinal cutting Friday editions and the Herald publishing print issues once a week.

The 1970s saw the &quot;Cardinal&quot; maintain its strong issue advocacy, but opinion began to shift to more campus, rather than national, angles. In the last half of the decade, the paper continually attacked the university for its holdings in corporations that participated in apartheid in South Africa.

In 1987 the &quot;Cardinal&quot; survived a hostile takeover attempt by the &quot;Herald&quot; when then-president of the Daily Cardinal Board of Directors David Atkins conspired with Herald Publisher Richard Ausman to hire Herald staffers for Cardinal leadership positions and eventually merge the papers. The same year, it became free, and has remained so until this day.

===Strife and shutdown: 1988-1995===
In the beginning of the difficult stretch for the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, in 1988 the university announced it would shut down the paper&#x27;s presses, then located in Vilas Hall. Fortunately for the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the university decided to sell the presses to UW–Extension, which remained the &quot;Cardinal&quot;’s printer for the next five years. Today, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; is printed at Capital Newspapers.

In 1995, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was forced to stop printing due to financial issues, suffering a seven-month shutdown until the necessary funds were secured to return to publication.

===&quot;The Cardinal&quot; reborn: 1995-===
The &quot;Cardinal&quot; returned to campus later that year with a cover depicting a cardinal rising from ashes like a phoenix. The paper repaid its remaining debts two years to the day of the shutdown.

In 2000, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; broke the story that university officials had digitally inserted a black student&#x27;s face into a photograph of white Badger football fans. The image had been used on the cover of Wisconsin&#x27;s 2001-02 undergraduate application. The story received the 2001 Diversity Story of the Year award for student journalism, awarded by the Associated Collegiate Press and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In 2012, the Cardinal celebrated the 120th anniversary of its first publication with an alumni gathering featuring presentations by former Cardinal staffers who had gone on to win Pulitzer prizes and Emmy awards, a gala banquet at the nearby Orpheum Theater and a tribute to Anthony Shadid, who had died earlier in the year.

In November 2015, the Cardinal announced it would begin a new publication schedule by publishing two print issues per week while also moving to a new online platform, effective with the start of the spring semester. The new publishing schedule, following a similar cut in print publishing by the Herald the previous year, left the UW-Madison campus without a daily newspaper print edition for the first time in decades.

===Official history===
&quot;It Doesn&#x27;t End With Us&quot;, the official history of &quot;The Daily Cardinal&quot;, was published in 2007.

<text>Peter Malcolm Hilt (born 1942) is a former New Zealand politician.

== Biography ==

Hilt was born in Auckland, and attended Takapuna Grammar School. He was in the New Zealand Police for 18 years, becoming a Detective Sergeant.

He was an MP from 1990 to 1996, representing first the National Party and then United New Zealand. He was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election, defeating Labour&#x27;s Judy Keall in the Glenfield seat. In 1995, however, he left National to join the new United New Zealand Party, founded as a centrist group by seven sitting MPs. In the 1996 general election, he was not re-elected. He stood in the electorate where he came fifth. He was ranked in 6th place on United&#x27;s party list, but with the party receiving only 0.88% of the party vote, it did not qualify for any list MPs.

In the 44th New Zealand Parliament, Hilt was elected Deputy Chairman of Committees on 1 March 1995 after Joy McLauchlan resigned that position on 27 February. Hilt was the last to hold this role as it was disestablished on 21 February 1996. Though he had by this time left the National Party, Hilt continued in the succeeding position of first Assistant Speaker. Until the appointment of Green MP Teanau Tuiono as third assistant speaker in 2023, he was the only presiding officer of the New Zealand House of Representatives since 1943 not to have been a member of either National or Labour while serving.

<doc id="1130803" wikidata="Q7927581" url="?curid=1130803" title="Victory disease">
<text>Victory disease occurs in military history when or arrogance, brought on by a victory or a series of victories, makes an engagement end disastrously for a commander and his forces.

A commander may disdain the enemy, and believe his own invincibility, leading his troops to disaster. That commander may employ strategies that, if effective in earlier combats or maneuvers, prove catastrophic against a new or smarter enemy. The commander afflicted by &quot;victory disease&quot; may also fail to anticipate that a new enemy may use tactics different from those of old enemies. An overconfident commander may disregard military intelligence that would enable the commander to realize that new tactics are needed.

Though &quot;victory disease&quot; does not inevitably foretell defeat, it often precedes it. The term is also applied outside the military world in areas such as psychology, business, or marketing.

==Origin==

The origin of the term (, in Japanese) is associated with the Japanese advance in the Pacific Theater of World War II, where, after attacking Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japan won a series of nearly uninterrupted victories against the Allies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

Much of Japan&#x27;s arrogance is attributed to the performance of Admiral Matome Ugaki. From overriding decisions to ignoring the evolving conflict in the Pacific, Ugaki&#x27;s tactics incited tension and doubt in other Japanese military personnel before the Midway operation.

Although the Japanese had planned to establish a perimeter and go on the defensive, victories encouraged them to continue expanding to an extent that strained logistics and the navy. This culminated in the Battle of Midway in 1942, a catastrophic defeat of the Japanese navy. All four Japanese aircraft carriers involved were sunk, and the hitherto unstoppable Japanese advance was blunted.

==History==
===Pre-industrial===
* The hubris of Xerxes I led to a catastrophic defeat of the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Salamis, which occurred in 480 BC. This was the turning point of the Greco-Persian Wars and the ancient Greeks, who the Persians were opposing, eventually won. The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus fought in the battle; he wrote the play &quot;The Persians&quot; in which the Battle of Salamis is a setting.
* In 1415, at the Battle of Agincourt, the English were outnumbered between three and five to one, but the disorganization of French knights, as well as superb quality longbows, were the underlying circumstances which led to the English overcoming the odds and annihilating the French.
* The overconfidence and lack of preparation led to the disastrous defeat of the English, led by Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn to the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce.
* The Spanish naval assault on England in 1588 suffered the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Similarly, English overconfidence the following year led to the disaster of the English Armada.

===19th century===
* The calamitous decision by Napoleon to invade Russia in 1812 led to the return of only 10,000 French soldiers when 610,000 had initially been sent out. Napoleon&#x27;s repeated victories in Central Europe led him to believe that Russia would surrender after a few won battles, and made no plans for a sustained campaign or occupation in Russia.
*The first six weeks of the Franco-Prussian War saw French armies, convinced of their superiority following French victories in the Crimean War and the wars of Italian unification, enter a war with Prussia believing that their weapons and tactics would easily defeat the Prussians. However, the Prussians had better tactics and this led to catastrophic French defeats at Sedan and Metz.
* United States victories against Mexico and American Indians led Union forces to be overconfident going into the Civil War. Failing to update their tactics to match new technology, such as rifling of firearms and the use of the Minie ball as ammunition, they assumed that superior numbers would give them rapid victories, and ignored plans for an extended war until after repeated defeats.
* Confederate decisions made at and before their loss at the Battle of Gettysburg, after their outnumbered-five-to-two victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville and previous battles before then in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.
* Captain and Brevet Lt. Col. William J. Fetterman boasted during America&#x27;s Indian Wars that, given &quot;80 men,&quot; he would &quot;ride through the Sioux nation&quot;. He had contempt for the Sioux&#x27;s fighting ability and overconfidence in his own military prowess. In 1866, during Red Cloud&#x27;s War, he and his army of exactly 80 men (including two volunteering civilians) were massacred to the last man by a combined force of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho. It was possibly the worst army defeat on the Great Plains until eclipsed by the disaster at Little Bighorn ten years later.
* The 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne annihilated five companies of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and severely mauled six others. Expecting a repeat of the Battle of Washita River, Custer ignored contrary intelligence or did not seek it out.
* In the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana, during the Anglo-Zulu War, a Zulu army wiped out a British army equipped with the most advanced weapons and tactics of the age. This victory at Isandlwana led a previously unengaged Zulus unit, Undi Corps under Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande, to believe they would easily wipe out the British defenders in the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift with ferocity and sheer numbers and so attacked the location in violation of orders from King Cetshwayo kaMpande. Instead, the British, who used sensible tactics and concentrated their firepower as much as possible, won the battle and killed 351 confirmed Zulu men, with another 500 wounded.

===20th century===
* The battles of Cer and Kolubara during the First World War were considered disastrous defeats for the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, whose overconfidence and underestimation of the Serbian Army eventually led to a two-year delay in the Serbian Campaign.
*The Battle of Pingxingguan during the Second Sino-Japanese War between Japan and China. After a series of easy victories against their opponents, the overconfident Japanese failed to take elementary precautions.
*Italy&#x27;s entry in WW2 (1940) followed a series of victories in Libya (1922-1932), Ethiopia (1935-1936), Spain (1936-1939), and Albania (1939), which gave the Fascist regime the illusion of being able to win a global war against Britain.
* The catastrophic decision by Hitler to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 underestimated Soviet military resilience and counted on the success of the tactics used in previous campaigns, such as the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France. Confident of victory, the Germans did not count on getting caught in a Russian winter or &quot;rasputitsa&quot; (mud season). As a result, the German offensive in the Soviet Union was halted on December 5, 1941.
* Japan&#x27;s decision to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. This followed wins in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War, and early victories during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As it turned out, the attack appeared tactically successful, but was strategically disastrous with the US Pacific Fleet damaged to a relatively superficial degree, with its carrier groups out at sea while vital shore base facilities were ignored in the attack such as its fuel storage, whose destruction could have crippled fleet operations for months by itself. More significantly, with the corresponding Japanese diplomatic communication being too slow to process and present to the American government until after the attack began, the attack, intended in part to demoralize the Americans, provoked instead an infuriated retaliation that would ultimately defeat Japan.
* Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, believed that during the Suez Crisis, the Egyptian Armed forces had defeated the combined forces of Israel, the United Kingdom and France, when in reality it was the pressure from the United States which was the decisive factor. This gave Nasser an inflated view of the strength of his forces, so when the Six Day War started, he believed that Egypt would be able to defend itself against Israel&#x27;s advance. However, this overconfidence, as well as false &quot;victory&quot; reports which brought Jordan and Syria into the war, proved to be its downfall as Israel managed to defeat the Arab forces and conquered their territory as well.

<text>A selsoviet (; , ; ) is the shortened name for Selsky soviet, i.e., rural council (; ; ). It has three closely related meanings: 
*The administration (&quot;soviet&quot;) of a certain rural area.
*The area area itself administered by such a council.
*The building of the selsoviet administration.

Selsoviets were the lowest level of administrative division in rural areas in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they were preserved as a third tier of administrative-territorial division throughout Ukraine, Belarus, and many of the federal subjects of Russia.

A selsoviet is a rural administrative division of a raion that includes one or several smaller rural localities and is in a subordination to its respective raion administration.

The name refers to the local rural self-administration, the rural soviet (council), a part of the Soviet system of administration. A selsoviet was headed by a chairman, who had to be appointed by higher administration.

For a considerable period of Soviet history, passports of rural residents were stored in selsoviet offices, and people could not move outside their area of residence without the permission of selsoviet.

==Selsoviets in Russia==
Division into selsoviets as administrative-territorial units remained after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in many of the federal subjects of Russia.

In modern Russia, a selsoviet is a type of an administrative division of a district in a federal subject of Russia, which is equal in status to a town of district significance or an urban-type settlement of district significance, but is organized around a rural locality (as opposed to a town or an urban-type settlement). In some federal subjects, selsoviets were replaced with municipal rural settlements, which, in turn, were granted status of administrative-territorial units.

Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, this type of administrative division had a uniform definition on the whole territory of the Russian SFSR. After the adoption of the 1993 Constitution, the administrative-territorial structure of the federal subjects is no longer identified as the responsibility of the federal government or as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the federal subjects. This state of the matters is traditionally interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions are the sole responsibility of the federal subjects themselves. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another; that includes the manner in which the selsoviets are organized and the choice of a term to refer to such entities.

As of 2013, the following types of such entities are recognized:
*Inhabited locality (): in Krasnoyarsk Krai (together with selsoviets)
*Rural administration (): in the Republic of Kalmykia and in Tula Oblast (together with rural okrugs, rural territories, and volosts)
*Rural administrative okrug (): in Bryansk Oblast
*Rural okrug (): in the Mari El Republic, the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania, and the Sakha Republic; in Krasnodar Krai (together with stanitsa okrugs); in Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Kirov, Omsk, Ryazan, Tula (together with rural administrations, rural territories, and volosts), Tyumen, Ulyanovsk, and Yaroslavl Oblasts
*Rural settlement (): in the Altai and the Chuvash Republics; in Amur, Moscow, Rostov, Smolensk, Tver, and Voronezh Oblasts
*Rural territory (): in Kemerovo Oblast and Tula Oblast (together with rural administrations, rural okrugs, and volosts)
*Rural-type settlement administrative territory (): in the Komi Republic (together with selo administrative territories)
*Selo administrative territory (): in the Komi Republic (together with rural-type settlement administrative territories)

<text>Bruce Windsor Cliffe (24 September 1946 – 13 July 2022) was a New Zealand businessman and politician.

==Early life==
Cliffe was born in Auckland in 1946. His parents were Mervyn Walter and Hilda Frances Cliffe. He received his education at Campbells Bay School, Murrays Bay Intermediate, and Takapuna Grammar School. He graduated from the University of Auckland in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts. In 1971, he obtained a certificate in management studies from Templeton College, Oxford.

Cliffe married Josephine Jessie Winefield in 1969. They were to have one son and two daughters.

==Member of Parliament==

Cliffe was a Member of Parliament for the National Party from 1990 to 1996. In 1990 he replaced the retiring George Gair in the North Shore seat, and was re-elected in 1993. He became a Cabinet Minister in December 1993 holding the portfolios of Accident Compensation, Radio &amp; Television, and Associate Finance.

In 1994 he proposed Water Services Limited (Auckland Emergency water supply) bill.

In 1995, with the first mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation election impending in 1996, he resigned his cabinet posts and was a founder member of the United New Zealand Party, initially led by Clive Matthewson. Cliffe then unsuccessfully sought to bring about a merger of ACT and United, along with other smaller &quot;centre&quot; or liberal parties to create a &quot;united&quot; centre party for the new MMP environment. In 1996 he chose to resign from Parliament. The United New Zealand Party lost all but Peter Dunne&#x27;s seat in the 1996 election, and continued in Parliament under Dunne&#x27;s leadership.

On 27–29 May 1995, he participated in &quot;Wellington After the Quake&quot; Conference (page 191).

==After politics==
From 1997, Cliffe was the director of several businesses, including Northern Finance Limited, a property management company, and Millbank Technology Limited, trading as Zapmill.

In 2016, Cliffe expressed his disagreement with Living Earth getting a consent to process 75,000 tonnes of garden waste annually on Puketutu Island.

Cliffe died on 13 July 2022.

<doc id="1130816" wikidata="Q5349937" url="?curid=1130816" title="Eisenhower Range">
<text>The Eisenhower Range () is a majestic mountain range, about long and rising to , which rises between Reeves Névé on the west, Reeves Glacier on the south, and Priestley Glacier on the north and east, in Victoria Land, Antarctica. 
The range is flat topped and descends gradually to Reeves Névé, but is steep cliffed and marked by sharp spurs along the Priestley Glacier.
It is in the north of the Prince Albert Mountains, southwest of the Deep Freeze Range

==Exploration and name==

The Eisenhower Range was probably observed by most early expeditions due to its prominence as viewed from the Ross Sea. 
The range was mapped in detail by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1955–63. 
It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (|US-ACAN) for Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was President of the United States in 1954, at the time when the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Operation Deep Freeze expeditions to Antarctica were initiated.

The Eisenhower Range is in the Prince Albert Mountains. 
The northwestern tip of the range defines the southwest edge of the upper Priestley Glacier, and includes Clingman Peak, Tantalus Peak and the Ogden Heights.
The southwest extension of the range includes Calfee Nunatak, Mount Fenton, Mount Macintosh and Skinner Ridge, reaching down to the head of the Reeves Glacier.
The main southeast escarpment of the range includes Timber Peak, Mount New Zealand and Nash Ridge along the Priestley Glacier, and Mount Baxter, Simpson Crags, Mount Nansen, Thern Promontory, Mount Matz, Andersson Ridge, McCarthy Ridge, Rhodes Head and Gray Rock.

<doc id="1130826" wikidata="Q16150173" url="?curid=1130826" title="John Robertson (New Zealand politician, born 1951)">
<text>John Struan Robertson (born 6 December 1951) is a New Zealand politician and company director. 

Robertson was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives in 1990 as the Member of Parliament for Papakura. A centrist and originally a member of the New Zealand National Party, he changed allegiance to the United New Zealand Party in 1995. He has twice served in local government: as Papakura city mayor from 2004 to 2007 and as Waitomo district mayor since 2019.

==Member of Parliament==

After a career as a chartered accountant, Robertson was elected to the New Zealand House of Representatives 1990 as the Member of Parliament for Papakura. He succeeded the retiring former Minister of Education, Merv Wellington. Robertson was re-elected in the 1993 general election.

In 1995, he was one of seven centrist MPs who established United New Zealand. Robertson&#x27;s Papakura electorate was disestablished before the 1996 election; he stood instead for where he finished second to National&#x27;s Warren Kyd. United New Zealand did not poll high enough to be entitled to any list MPs, so Robertson left Parliament.

==Local government career==
Robertson was later appointed chair of Infrastructure Auckland, a council-owned organisation which ran the Ports of Auckland and owned the America&#x27;s Cup village. He served in this role from 2000 to 2004.

He was elected Mayor of Papakura and served from 2004 to 2007, when he was defeated. After his election loss he became dean of business at Manukau Institute of Technology.

In August 2012, the elected councillors of Kaipara District Council were replaced with a four-member commission as a result of serious governance and financial failures. Robertson was appointed as the chair of the commission. While Local Government Minister David Carter initially said that this commission was expected to remain until October 2015, it was not removed until October 2016.

Robertson contested and won the Waitomo district mayoralty in the 2019 local elections, defeating incumbent Brian Hanna. He was re-elected in 2022.

==Honours==
In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Robertson was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services and services to local body affairs.

<doc id="1130832" wikidata="Q3786221" url="?curid=1130832" title="Kathleen Wynne">
<text>Kathleen O&#x27;Day Wynne ( ; born May 21, 1953) is a former Canadian politician who served as the 25th premier of Ontario and leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 2013 to 2018. She was member of provincial parliament (MPP) for Don Valley West from 2003 to 2022. Wynne is the first female premier of Ontario and the first openly gay premier in Canada.

Wynne was first elected to public office as a trustee for the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) in 2000. She subsequently was elected to the Ontario Legislature in 2003. Under Premier Dalton McGuinty, she served in various cabinet posts, until resigning to run in the Liberal leadership race when McGuinty announced his resignation in 2012. Wynne replaced McGuinty as premier and leader of the Liberal Party upon her victory of the leadership, and subsequently led the party to a majority government victory in the 2014 Ontario provincial election.

As premier, Wynne introduced free prescription drug coverage for children, increased the minimum wage to $14 an hour, and introduced free post-secondary tuition for families making under $50,000. Controversially, her government introduced a reformed sex education curriculum, brought in a cap-and-trade pollution pricing regime with Quebec and California, and privatized Hydro One.

Wynne sought another mandate in the 2018 provincial election; however, she conceded midway into the election and acknowledged her party would not form government again. The Liberals would lose official party status in the worst defeat of a governing party in Ontario history. Wynne subsequently resigned as Liberal leader on election night and was succeeded by Ottawa South MPP John Fraser as interim party leader. Wynne formally resigned as premier on June 29, 2018. She held her seat in the Legislative Assembly and continued to sit as an MPP until 2022 when she did not contest the provincial election and retired from politics.

==Background==
Kathleen O&#x27;Day Wynne was born on May 21, 1953, in Richmond Hill, to Dr. John B. Wynne and Patsy O&#x27;Day. Her mother was a musician who grew up in Nassau in the Bahamas before immigrating to Canada.

Wynne grew up in Richmond Hill, Ontario. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Queen&#x27;s University and a Master of Arts degree in linguistics from the University of Toronto. She achieved a Master of Education degree in adult education from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (University of Toronto). She was a member of the discipline committee of the Ontario Society of Psychotherapists from 1997 to 2000.

Wynne served as president of the Toronto Institute of Human Relations. In 1996, she helped found Citizens for Local Democracy, which opposed the amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto undertaken by the Progressive Conservative (PC) government of Premier Mike Harris. She founded the Metro Parent Network (later renamed the Toronto Parent Network) which supports improvements in the province&#x27;s public education system and has participated in numerous other community endeavours.

Prior to her coming out as a lesbian at age 37 she was married to Phil Cowperthwaite, with whom she had three children. She now lives with her second spouse, Jane Rounthwaite, whom Wynne has stated is to be referred to as her &quot;partner&quot; (rather than &quot;wife&quot;). They were married in July 2005 at Fairlawn Avenue United Church in Toronto. Wynne is a member of the United Church of Canada.

==School trustee==
Wynne first ran for trustee in 1994 in Ward 12 but was defeated by Ann Vanstone. In 2000, she ran again and was elected as a trustee for the Toronto District School Board in ward 8. During the campaign, she was labelled an &quot;extremist lesbian&quot; in literature distributed by the &quot;Concerned Citizens of North York and North Toronto&quot;. This was the ratepayer group that later supported Karen Stintz in her campaign against local councillor Anne Johnston. Wynne strongly opposed cuts to public education mandated by the Progressive Conservative government.

In 2001, Wynne helped pass a measure encouraging public schools to purchase teaching materials reflecting the presence of gay and lesbian parents in modern society. In December 2001, she ran for chair of the school board but was defeated by Donna Cansfield in a 12–10 vote.

==Early provincial politics==
Wynne was a co-founder with John Sewell of Citizens for Local Democracy, a grassroots group that opposed the 1999 amalgamation of the old City of Toronto with the rest of Metropolitan Toronto. She attempted to enter provincial politics on the strength of her grassroots work and sought the Liberal nomination in St. Paul&#x27;s for the 1999 provincial election but was defeated for the party nomination by Michael Bryant by a margin of 328 votes to 143. She was elected to the school board the following year, and in 2003, became the Liberal nominee in Don Valley West. In the 2003 provincial election, she defeated Progressive Conservative cabinet minister David Turnbull by over 5,000 votes and became MPP for her riding. The Liberals won the election, and Wynne was appointed parliamentary assistant to Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities Mary Anne Chambers, in October 2003. In October 2004, she was appointed parliamentary assistant to Minister of Education Gerard Kennedy.

From June 2005 to November 2005 she served as a member of the Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which recommended &quot;that the referendum be binding upon a vote of 50% + 1, and the support of 50% + 1 in at least two-thirds (i.e., 71) of the ridings or any other formula that ensures the result has support from Northern, rural, and urban areas of the Province&quot;, although the cabinet subsequently decided on 100.

On September 18, 2006, she was promoted to minister of education in a cabinet shuffle occasioned by the resignation of Joe Cordiano from the Legislature. She was the province&#x27;s first openly lesbian cabinet minister and only the second openly LGBT cabinet minister after Deputy Premier George Smitherman. On January 18, 2010, she was moved to minister of transportation and in 2011 she was appointed minister of municipal affairs and housing and minister of aboriginal affairs.

In the 2007 provincial election, Wynne was challenged by the PC leader John Tory. Tory, who was elected to Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey (former PC leader Ernie Eves&#x27; riding) in a by-election, was seeking a seat in a Toronto-area riding. Though it was projected to be a close race, Wynne was re-elected with 50.4 percent of the popular vote, defeating Tory, who came in second with 39.7 percent of the popular vote.

===McGuinty cabinet===

==2013 leadership race==

Premier Dalton McGuinty announced on October 15, 2012, that he would resign as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and premier of the province once his successor was chosen.

On November 2, 2012, Wynne resigned her cabinet post and three days later launched her bid for the leadership of the party. Wynne was seen as having the strongest on-the-ground organization among the seven candidates, and along with former MPP Sandra Pupatello, and was one of the front runners. She had the most supporters running to be delegates at the convention, with 1,533, and was the only candidate to have supporters in place in all 107 of the province&#x27;s ridings. Days before members were to begin electing delegates Glen Murray announced he was exiting the leadership race and endorsed Wynne&#x27;s candidacy. Despite running with the most supporters for delegate positions Wynne placed second, with 468 delegates, behind Pupatello who had 509 delegates. Pupatello was also believed to have the most support among &quot;ex officio&quot; delegates, which are MPPs, MPs (members of parliament), defeated candidates and other Liberal insiders, and was expected to increase her lead over Wynne on the first ballot at the convention.

At the convention on January 26, 2013, she used her speech to discuss repairing relations with teachers and working with opposition parties, and took aim at her main rival Pupatello, who did not hold a seat, by saying that she was ready to govern and would recall the legislature on February 19. Wynne also addressed her sexuality saying; &quot;When I ran in 2003, I was told that the people of North Toronto and Thorncliffe Park were not ready to elect a gay woman. Well, apparently they were.&quot; She went on to say &quot;I don&#x27;t believe the people of Ontario judge their leaders on the basis of race, colour or sexual orientation – I don&#x27;t believe they hold that prejudice in their hearts.&quot;

When the first ballot results were announced Wynne received 597 votes, trailing Pupatello by only two votes. Eric Hoskins received the fewest votes of the six candidates and was therefore eliminated. Hoskins threw his support behind Wynne while fourth-place candidate Harinder Takhar announced he was endorsing Pupatello. On the second ballot, Pupatello&#x27;s lead grew to 67 votes over Wynne. Takhar, whose name was left on the second ballot, finished last and was eliminated from the race. Gerard Kennedy and Charles Sousa, who finished third and fourth respectively, withdrew from the race and both endorsed Wynne. With the support of both Kennedy and Sousa, her win was all but guaranteed on the third ballot. When the results of that ballot were announced Wynne received 57 per cent of the votes compared to 43 per cent for Pupatello.

==Premiership (2013–2018)==

Wynne was sworn in as premier of Ontario on February 11, 2013, becoming the province&#x27;s first female premier, and the first premier in Canada to be openly gay. After four months of prorogation of the legislature, Wynne resumed the house on February 17, 2013.

===Gas plant scandal===
After being sworn in as premier, Wynne quickly became embroiled in the Ontario power plant scandal, which had developed under the administration of her predecessor, Premier Dalton McGuinty. Opposition parties accused Wynne of having a role in the McGuinty government&#x27;s costly decision to cancel the construction of gas plants in Mississauga and North-East Oakville in 2011, when she was co-chair of the Liberal campaign. Wynne denied that she was involved in the gas plant meetings or in the decision to cancel the plants, and asked the auditor general to investigate the cost of cancelling the plants. After months of investigation, the auditor general released their report on the gas plants in October 2013, suggesting the cancellation of both gas plants could cost taxpayers as much as $1.1 billion. After the report was released by the auditor general, Wynne admitted the gas plant relocations &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have happened&quot;. She apologized, vowing to ensure that &quot;this doesn&#x27;t happen again&quot;.

In February 2013, the legislative committee that had been investigating the gas plants cancellation prior to McGuinty&#x27;s resignation and prorogation of the legislature in October resumed its work. Wynne called for the release of all documents related to the decision to the legislature&#x27;s Justice Committee and agreed to testify before the committee, while continuing to deny that she was involved in the decision to cancel the plants. Appearing before the committee in April 2013, Wynne testified she had had no role in the decision to cancel the plants, and had learned of the decision to cancel the plants through media reports.

In June 2013, opposition parties called on the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) to open an investigation into new allegations that staffers in Premier McGuinty&#x27;s office had deleted emails regarding the gas plants. On June 7, the OPP launched a criminal investigation into the deletion of the emails, after the Privacy Commissioner ruled that the gas plant emails were illegally deleted. In April 2014, OPP investigators stated that there was no evidence that the premier had been involved in the deletion of emails related to the gas plants, and that the Premier was not the subject of their investigation, which was instead focused on staffers and bureaucrats who had worked in Premier McGuinty&#x27;s office.

On March 24, 2014, Wynne introduced a piece of legislation called the &quot;Public Sector and MPP Accountability and Transparency Act&quot;, which implemented a wide range of new measures designed to increase government accountability and transparency. Among other things, the act required all MPPs, cabinet ministers, parliamentary assistants, opposition leaders, and their respective staff to post their expense reports online, expanded the powers of the integrity commissioner and ombudsman, and introduced a fine of $5,000 for the willful destruction of government records. While Wynne declined to characterize the act as a rebuke to McGuinty and those who had been involved in the deletion of gas plant-related emails, the act was widely seen as a response to the gas plants controversy and other controversies over government officials&#x27; and public sector employees&#x27; expenses.

In April 2014, Wynne launched a libel lawsuit against PC MPP Lisa MacLeod and Party Leader Hudak after they said that she &quot;oversaw and possibly ordered the criminal destruction of [gas plant] documents&quot;. In July 2015, Wynne, MacLeod and Hudak reached an agreement whereby the lawsuit was dropped. They said in a joint statement, &quot;Politics is not for the thin-skinned. However, our system also requires that politicians act honestly and based on fact, while respecting the views of others ... In the lead-up to the last election the debate went beyond differences over our approach and at times became personal. The lawsuit between us, and the comments that led to it, did not reflect our view that the other is in fact a great mother/father, an honourable person and a dedicated public servant.&quot; The statement avoided any apology or placement of blame.

===Hydro One===

In 2016, Kathleen Wynne decided to sell 30 per cent of Hydro One, an electric utility Crown corporation, to private owners. The owners are free to increase prices and sell up to 60 per cent of the government&#x27;s total shares. Wynne used approximately four billion dollars of the nine billion dollars which the shares were sold for to pay off government debt before the next election, and the other five billion dollars to the Trillium Trust to improve transit lines and to build infrastructure. Wynne faced major backlash for the privatization of Hydro One. Approximately 67 per cent of Ontario citizens did not agree with the privatization, and her approval rating dropped to 14 per cent, the lowest of any premier in Ontario&#x27;s history.

===2013 budget===

On March 21, 2013, Wynne introduced her government&#x27;s first budget with measures that included a $295 million investment into a youth jobs strategy to help tackle the high youth unemployment rate, reducing auto insurance rates by 15 per cent to save motorists $225 a year, $260 million investment to boost home care health services for 46,000 seniors, $45 million investment into an Ontario Music Fund to help Ontario musicians, a $200 per month earnings exemption for those on Ontario Works and Ontario Disability Support Program, $5 million into First Nations education, elimination of the employers health tax exemption for large companies, postponed tax cuts for big businesses, extended the capital cost allowance for machinery and equipment, increased the Ontario Child Benefit from $1,100 to $1,310 per year to support low-income families and other economic measures.

Critics called the budget a lavish expenditure in order to gain support from the New Democratic Party (NDP) for the budget. PC leader Tim Hudak had earlier said that he would not support the budget regardless of its contents. He said, &quot;the sooner there&#x27;s a change in government, the better it is to give hope to people in the province who have lost hope.&quot; On June 11, 2013, the budget passed by a vote of 64–36 with NDP support and all 36 PC members voting against it.

===Education===
Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s involvement with the administration of grade school and post-secondary education was largely marked by labour disruptions and teacher strikes. Wynne immediately started new collective bargaining negotiations with the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario (ETFO) after a year of labour distress that had culminated in the &quot;Putting Students First Act, 2012&quot;, which had suspended collective bargaining rights, imposed contracts on teachers and suspended the right to strike.

On April 8, 2014, the Wynne government reached a new bargaining agreement with the teachers unions and passed the &quot;School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014&quot;, which restored their bargaining rights, the right to strike, kept the wage freeze on teachers, eliminated the retirement gratuity for teachers, and assigned her provincial government control over funding for schools and programs. The legislation also gave the minister of education the power to audit school boards if disclosure of spending was not provided. Wynne established the Premier&#x27;s Youth Advisory Council to advise the premier on issues facing youth.

In February 2015, her government introduced changes to the sex education curriculum, which has not been updated since 1998, in public schools. These included lessons on masturbation, and &quot;gender expression&quot; with the changes being met with controversy and protests several thousand strong not only by the opposition parties but among parents; in one instance, some schools were empty as some parents pulled their children out in protest of these changes. In her final year as premier, Wynne also introduced back to work legislation for two different strikes by post-secondary educators, where the unions complained of precarious working conditions and predatory wages, in some cases caused by chronic under-funding from the provincial government. Her legislation to force an end to the strikes succeeded in the first case but failed in the second.

===Economy===
On January 30, 2014, Wynne announced her government increased the minimum wage from $10.25 to $11 after a four-year freeze on the rate and introduced legislation to ensure future increases to the minimum wage to keep up with the CPI (Consumer Price Index). Wynne also announced a partnership with Cisco Canada that would create 1,700 new jobs. Prior to these announcements, Wynne had announced tax relief for small businesses by increasing the employers&#x27; health-tax exemption from $400,000 to $450,000.

Between late October and early November 2014, Wynne went on a trade mission to China along with other provincial premiers. The trade mission attracted approximately a billion dollars&#x27; worth of investment and 1,800 new jobs to Ontario.

After Honda announced plans to invest $857 million in three plants, Wynne also announced that her government would invest 10 per cent of the total invested by Honda.

By the end of 2015, the unemployment rate in Ontario had become lower than the national average. The Conference Board of Canada also found that Ontario&#x27;s economy had the second strongest growth rate of all provinces in 2015 behind British Columbia (BC), and was projected to be in the top 3 for 2016 among BC and Manitoba.

===2014 election===

Throughout the spring of 2014, there was widespread speculation that a general election would be triggered upon the presentation of the 2014–15 provincial budget, due to recent gains in by-elections by the NDP, whose support was required for the Liberal government&#x27;s budget to pass. On May 1, 2014, the Wynne government handed down its budget, which was described as &quot;NDP-friendly&quot; by many pundits. One Queen&#x27;s Park columnist called the budget, &quot;the most progressive one this province has seen since [former NDP leader] Bob Rae was Premier.&quot; In it, the Liberals projected a $12.5 billion deficit for the 2014-15 fiscal year, with an attempt to eliminate the deficit by 2017–18. The budget included wage increases for home care and child care workers, a $29 billion transportation plan to fund roads, bridges, and transit around the province, an Ontario Registered Pension Plan, which would act as a supplement to the Canada Pension Plan, higher taxes on high-income earners, and increased fees for cigarettes and airplane fuel, among others.

The budget was contingent on NDP support, as the PCs had already indicated that they would vote against it. While NDP leader, Andrea Horwath, had, during the last two budget negotiations in 2012 and 2013, spent some time reviewing the budget and talking to her supporters before revealing how her party would vote, this time she almost immediately announced the NDP would not support the budget, thus sending the province into a general election. The day after the budget was read, Wynne went to the lieutenant governor to dissolve the Legislature and trigger an election, rather than wait for her budget to be voted down on the floor of the Legislature. The election was called for June 12, 2014, extending the campaign to five weeks (rather than the minimum of 29 days) to avoid a conflict with a Jewish holiday.

While pundits had predicted the Ontario election to be a wild card three-way race between the Liberals, PCs and NDP, the first two weeks of the campaign saw the polls stabilize into a narrow two-party race between Wynne&#x27;s Liberals and Tim Hudak&#x27;s PCs, with the NDP falling into a distant third. The first public poll of the campaign, conducted by Forum Research, showed the PCs ahead in the popular vote, but the Liberals likely on track to retain a minority government.

Wynne ran a fairly controversy-free campaign, although her performance in the televised leaders&#x27; debate on June 3 was criticized by pundits as being weak and she was on the defensive for many of the scandals that had plagued her predecessor, Dalton McGuinty. The NDP&#x27;s slow start and public internal rift over the party&#x27;s decision to reject Wynne&#x27;s budget coupled with the unpopularity of Hudak&#x27;s 100,000 job cut pledge helped Wynne throughout the campaign. She began to eat away at the NDP&#x27;s traditional left-wing support, especially in and around Toronto, and the controversies over some of Hudak&#x27;s economic policies hurt him among centrist voters across the province. Furthermore, Wynne ran hard near the end of the campaign on the premise that in a close election, the Liberals were the only party who were in a position to defeat the PCs. The Liberals ran ads in the final weeks of the campaign warning voters that a vote for the NDP would be a vote for the PCs as it would further divide the anti-Hudak vote (who was quite unpopular among a broad swath of Ontario voters). This tactic was similar to what the federal Liberals were successful at doing during the 2004 federal election, where the party pushed hard for strategic voting to stop the federal Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper. In fact, many of the top campaign operatives during Wynne&#x27;s election worked on the 2004 federal Liberal campaign.

Wynne&#x27;s Liberals were only endorsed by one major newspaper, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, while most other news organizations endorsed the Hudak PCs. There was a controversy that emerged regarding &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; election endorsement. According to an online leak, a majority of the members of the editorial board were prepared to endorse the Liberals, but were overruled by upper management. There was also controversy surrounding a cartoon in the Sun newspapers during the final week of the campaign that showed a pair of broken glasses, presumably Wynne&#x27;s, smashed on the ground with a smattering of blood. The cartoon received near universal condemnation for projecting the image that abusing women was somehow accepted in society. Nevertheless, in the final week of the campaign, Wynne led most public opinion polls, some of which projected a majority Liberal government on June 12, though the final polls of the campaign predicted different results. One pollster, Ipsos Reid, still projected on the final day of the campaign that the PCs were ahead among likely voters, and that the NDP and Liberals were tied at around 30 per cent.

On election day, Wynne&#x27;s Liberals led province-wide all night as they captured a fourth term in office, and moved from minority to majority government. However, the election results proved to be mixed:

:* The Liberals only lost 2 seats that they had held at dissolution, Teresa Piruzza in Windsor West and the open seat in Sudbury, but captured 10 seats from the PCs and NDP, all of them in and around the Golden Horseshoe.
:* They managed to capitalize on the NDP&#x27;s drift away from their left flank under Horwath&#x27;s leadership by winning long-held NDP seats in Toronto, but the NDP managed to hold on to the seats they had previously gained in by-elections, while also taking two seats from the PCs. The Liberals also won 7 PC seats in the GTHA, including ridings like Durham, Cambridge and Burlington that had been held by the PCs for decades.
:* Voter turnout also increased to 52.1 per centthe first increase in decadesbut it was the failure of the PCs to increase their vote count (while all other major parties saw theirs increase) that proved to be the key factor in the outcome.
:* The party was quite successful at turning out Liberal voters in competitive ridings, especially in the GTA, Ottawa, and Midwestern Ontario. Wynne herself was re-elected handily in her North Toronto riding of Don Valley West.

It was observed after the election, that her sexual orientation was treated as a complete non-issue during the campaign with Wynne subject to no significant comment because of that personal detail. On July 2, Wynne re-convened the Ontario Legislature to pass the budget that had been introduced, but not voted on, prior to the writs being dropped for the election.

===2015 budget===

Kathleen Wynne, under the advice of Ed Clark, partially privatized Hydro One and reformed the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Liquor Licence Act&quot; to allow the sale of six-packs of beer in Ontario grocery stores, the latter of which was the result of a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; exclusive on the anti-competitive practices made by the privately owned Beer Store.

Wynne also put transit expansion front and centre in the budget. On April 21, 2015, Wynne announced that the provincial government would foot the entire bill for the construction of the Hurontario–Main LRT in the Region of Peel, to connect Mississauga with Brampton, a major infrastructure project in one of the fastest growing regions of the province.

On May 26, 2015, Wynne announced that the provincial government would fund 100 per cent of the costs to build a LRT system in Hamilton. Wynne announced that $1 billion would be allocated for the project, with construction slated to get underway in 2019. Wynne also announced the extension of the Lakeshore GO Line from downtown Hamilton to a new station at Centennial Parkway in Stoney Creek.

===2016 budget===

The 2016 budget projected $133.9 billion in spending resulting in a deficit of $4.3 billion for 2016–17, with a return to a balanced budget in 2017–18. The province unveiled its climate change plan, which introduced a phased-in cap-and-trade plan that will be similar to schemes in California and Quebec. As a result, gasoline prices increased by 4.3 cents per litre in 2017 and natural gas rates rose by 3.3 cents per cubic metre. In education, the provincial government announced it would provide free college and university tuition for students from families with an annual household income of less than $50,000.

The province&#x27;s debt in 2016 was $296.1 billion and was expected to rise to $350 billion by 2020–21.

===Job approval rating===

In June 2016, a Forum Research Poll reported that Wynne&#x27;s approval rating had dropped from a high of 40 per cent to 18 per cent. In September 2016, a Forum Research poll reported that the Progressive Conservatives enjoyed 45 per cent support. Wynne&#x27;s Liberals enjoyed 25 per cent support, slightly ahead of the provincial New Democrats at 23 per cent.

In March 2017 the Angus Reid Institute reported that her job approval rating had fallen to 12 per cent, the lowest ever recorded.

===Negativity on social media===
Wynne has faced negativity on social media outlets, such as Twitter and Facebook. Although most of the negative tweets express anger solely about her record as premier, some include sexist and/or homophobic slurs. Her sexual orientation is said to have made her more vulnerable to these abuses. Although Wynne faces sexist and homophobic abuse, she was confident that the situation can change &quot;but it’s going to mean that people are going to have to speak up&quot;.

===Alberta legislature incident===
During an Alberta legislative session in May 2016, Wynne appeared as a special guest in the Alberta Legislature. During this session, Wildrose Party MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) and finance critic Derek Fildebrandt attacked her economic policies by calling Ontario a &quot;fiscal basket case&quot;. When the Wildrose party expressed &quot;regret&quot; over his comments, one of his constituents made a homophobic comment on Fildebrandt&#x27;s Facebook page, which he responded to by saying that he was &quot;proud of constituents like you&quot;. Afterwards, Wynne spoke out against the party, stating that they were &quot;out of step&quot; with reality. Fildebrandt was expelled from the Wildrose caucus, but was later re-admitted, after he apologized and claimed that his support of the homophobic comment on Facebook had been &quot;an honest mistake&quot;. Wynne accepted his apology via an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

===Leading to the 2018 election===

In 2016, the government spent almost $800,000 in rebates for electric vehicles costing more than $100,000. In 2017, the rules were changed so that electric vehicles with price tags of between $75,000 to $150,000 were made eligible for rebates of up to $14,000. In March 2018, Wynne&#x27;s government cancelled incentives for electric vehicles costing more than $75,000. In March 2017, the Liberal government announced &quot;free tuition&quot; for families earning less than $50,000 by updating the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP). Ontario&#x27;s minimum wage increased $2.40 from $11.60 to $14 effective from January 1, 2018. Wynne also planned to increase the minimum wage to $15 the following year. Also from January 1, 2018, Wynne made prescription drugs free for people aged 24 and under.

===2018 election===
Wynne&#x27;s Liberals headed into the 2018 provincial election campaign trailing far behind the PCs, led by former Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford. In early April, CBC News published their analysis of aggregate polls showing that Ford and the PCs were ahead of the other parties averaging 42.1 per cent support, compared to 27.2 per cent for the governing Liberals, 23.4 percent for the NDP and 5.7 per cent for the Greens and with 11 Liberal MPPs announcing they would not be running for re-election or having already resigned their seats in the months leading up to the election.

Voters were offered a &quot;stark choice&quot;, according to Wynne, between &quot;cutting and removing supports from people&quot; with &quot;billions in cuts&quot;, which she alleged the PCs would do if they won the election, and expanding investments in social programs such as pharmacare and childcare, which the Liberal platform promised.

In March 2018, the Liberals tabled a pre-election budget in the provincial legislature which promised billions of dollars in new spending for free childcare and expanded dental care but replaced the government&#x27;s previous balanced budget with a $6.7 billion deficit projected to last until 2024–2025. PC leader Doug Ford called the budget a &quot;spending spree&quot;. Towards the end of the election, Wynne pledged to recall the legislature in order to legislate striking graduate students at York University back to work, which NDP leader Andrea Horwath stated was a violation of the students&#x27; constitutional rights.

On June 2, five days before the election, Wynne conceded that the Liberals would not win a fifth term, but she urged voters to vote for Liberal candidates in the election to ensure a PC or NDP minority. Nevertheless, the election resulted in a PC majority government with the NDP as the official opposition. The Liberals lost almost half their vote from 2013 and were reduced to seven seats, their worst result since Confederation, and one short of the eight seats needed for official party status. Notably, the Liberals were decimated in the Golden Horseshoe; they won only three seats in Toronto, and lost all of their seats in the 905 region. They also won only one seat outside of Toronto and Ottawa. The seven-member rump caucus was also the only remnant of Wynne&#x27;s cabinet. Wynne narrowly held onto her own riding of Don Valley West, winning by only 181 votes. She announced her resignation as Liberal Party leader on election night. On June 29, 2018, Wynne formally resigned as premier. Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell appointed Doug Ford as her successor.

On October 20, 2020, Wynne announced that she would not be a candidate in the 43rd Ontario general election.

<doc id="1130838" wikidata="Q2038843" url="?curid=1130838" title="Atellan Farce">
<text>The Atellan Farce (Latin: &quot;Atellanae Fabulae&quot; or &quot;Fabulae Atellanae&quot;, &quot;favola atellana&quot;; &quot;Atellanicum exhodium&quot;, &quot;Atella comedies&quot;), also known as the Oscan Games (Latin: &quot;ludi Osci&quot;, &quot;Oscan plays&quot;), were masked improvised farces in Ancient Rome. The Oscan athletic games were very popular, and usually preceded by longer pantomime plays. The origin of the Atellan Farce is uncertain, but the farces are similar to other forms of ancient theatre such as the South Italian Phlyakes, the plays of Plautus and Terence, and Roman mime. Most historians believe the name is derived from Atella, an Oscan town in Campania. The farces were written in Oscan and imported to Rome in 391 BC. In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters speak their lines in Oscan, while the others speak in Latin.

==History and surviving evidence==
The Atellan Farce was a masked farce that originated in Italy by 300 B.C.and remained popular for more than 500 years. Originally, the farces were improvised and not recorded. Evidence of the original forms is scarce, primarily found in the depictions of scenes and characters on ancient vases.

The extant literary evidence contains only fragments of the Atellan Farce with 400 lines and the titles of approximately 115 farces are recorded from the first century BC by the dramatists Lucius Pomponius and Quintus Novius. With the evidence that does remain, historians believe the plays were between 300 and 400 lines and lasted from 15 to 28 minutes.

Surviving titles indicate that the Atellana or short sketches were meant to entertain the audience on holidays and market days. The names of some of these extant titles include &quot;The Farmer&quot;, &quot;The She-goat&quot;, &quot;The Woodpile&quot; and &quot;The Vine-Gatherers.&quot; While the actors in Atellan Farce were known to be Oscan, evidence of language-switching from Oscan to Latin is evident in a literary Atellana. We can also surmise that the plots of the sketches included ridiculous situations consisting of puns, horseplay and riddles of a vulgar and crude nature.

==Stock characters and origins==
Some of the hypothesized stock characters included:

* Maccus – Believed derived from either the Greek term &quot;makkoan,&quot; meaning &quot;to be stupid&quot; or the Greek prefix &quot;mac&quot;-, that denotes greed. The character Maccus makes the most appearances of all stock characters in the works of Pomponius and Novius and includes the play &quot;Maccus The Maid&quot; where confusion ensues from &quot;twin subjects.&quot; Maccus was a most popular clown and the leading character in many Atellan plays including &quot;The Fool&quot;, as a hunchback with a beak nose.
* Buccus – Although the origin of this name is not definitely known, the Latin word &quot;bucca&quot;, meaning &quot;cheek&quot; or &quot;mouth&quot; is a common consideration. and implies a &quot;country booby&quot; &quot;fat- cheeked, gluttonous braggart.&quot;
* Manducus – Deriving from the Latin for &quot;The chewer&quot;, Manducus is a hypothesized stock character that does not appear in any of the surviving titles Possibly Manducus and Dossennus are the same character and Manducus is simply the description for Dossennus. as the arrogant soldier.
* Pappus – The name is considered derived from the Greek &quot;pappos&quot; meaning &quot;grandfather.&quot; Pappus was easy to deceive, often falling victim to either his daughter or wife. The character appears in five extant plays. Pappus is the only character from Atellan Farce that has a name of Oscan origin as the old man.
* Centunculus – The name of a comic slave.
* Dossennus – The origin of the name Dossennus is believed to have originated from the word &quot;dorsum&quot; or &quot;back&quot; as the character was hump-backed as the pompous doctor or &quot;hump backed, crafty cheat.&quot;

The characters may have connections to similar roles in Commedia dell&#x27;arte and Punch and Judy. Both Atellan Farce and Commedia were improvised masked comedies. Stock characters in Atellan Farce are speculated as the beginnings of the Commedia dell&#x27;arte stock characters. For example, theorized character progressions include:

* Pappus → Pantalone
* Maccus + Buccus → Pulcinella
* Manducus → il Capitano

However, these connections remain speculative and are contested in ongoing research. There are similarities between Punch and the Commedia dell&#x27;arte character Pulcinella. However, there is no consensus that Punch&#x27;s derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella. The character Cicirrus, the Oscan word for &quot;gamecock&quot;, is thought to be a stock character.

==Authorship==
The subjects and characters were decided upon just before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens who were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were supplemented by songs in Saturnian metre, the common language, accompanied by lively gesticulation. The plays were characterized by coarseness and obscenity. Atellan play acting contained much pantomiming. All roles were played by males. The plays did not have elaborate scenery and were performed in normal theaters.

Atellan plays first became popular in Rome in the 3rd century B.C, with a revived popularity in literary form in the 1st century B.C. and included the stock characters in written verse.

Later, the dictator Sulla wrote some Atellan Fables. The dramatist Quintus Novius, who lived and wrote 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote fifty fables, including &quot;Macchus Exul&quot; (Exiled Macchus), &quot;Gallinaria&quot; (The Henhouse), &quot;Surdus&quot; (The Deaf One), &quot;Vindemiatores&quot; (The Harvesters), and &quot;Parcus&quot; (The Treasurer). When the Atellan plays were revived in the 1st century B.C. professional actors were no longer excluded from playing the stock characters&#x27; roles.

Lucius Pomponius of Bologna, influenced by Palliata Fabius Dorsennus composed several Atellan plays, including &quot;Macchus Miles&quot; (Macchus the Soldier), &quot;Pytho Gorgonius&quot;, &quot;Pseudoagamemnon&quot;, &quot;Bucco Adoptatus&quot;, and &quot;Aeditumus&quot;. Quintus Novius and a &quot;Memmius&quot; also authored these comedies. Ovid and Pliny the Younger found the work of Memmius to be indecent.

Pomponius is speculated to be the &quot;founder&quot; of the Atellan Farce plays.

==Controversy and suppression==
Taken from Tacitus (&quot;Annals&quot;, Book 14): &quot;...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor Tiberius finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players. &quot;They had often,&quot; he said &quot;sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate&#x27;s authority. The players, upon this, were banished from Italy&quot;.

Suetonius (&quot;Tiberius&quot;, 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying &quot;the old goat lapping up the doe&quot; (&quot;hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire&quot;) became popular.

In the 20s AD, the growth in popularity and revival of the Atellan plays was met with the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators. The performances became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all who performed in the farces were banished from Italy.

The &quot;Augustan History&quot; records that Hadrian furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.

==Contemporary comparisons==
Due to the outlandish nature and brevity that the Atellan Farces are believed to have, they are comparable to the sketches that one would see on a variety show such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; or &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Oftentimes the improvised play would center on an uncomplicated situation such as eating too much, becoming intoxicated or stealing. Such as in popular television shows as Saturday Night Live and Whose Line Is It Anyway, they would include adult content and done for the entertainment of others.

<text>The Sentinel Range is a major mountain range situated northward of Minnesota Glacier and forming the northern half of the Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica. The range trends NNW-SSE for about and is 24 to 48 km (15 to 30 mi) wide. Many peaks rise over and Vinson Massif (4892 m) in the southern part of the range is the highest elevation on the continent.

Sentinel Range comprises a main ridge (featuring Vinson Massif in its southern portion) and a number of distinct heights, ridges and mountains on its east side, including (south to north) Owen Ridge, Petvar Heights, Doyran Heights, Veregava Ridge, Flowers Hills, Sullivan Heights, Barnes Ridge, Maglenik Heights, Probuda Ridge, Bangey Heights, Sostra Heights and Gromshin Heights. It is separated from Bastien Range to the southwest by Nimitz Glacier, and from Heritage Range to the south by lower Minnesota Glacier.

The range was first sighted and photographed from the air on November 23, 1935, by Lincoln Ellsworth who in naming it recognized its prominent position as a landmark on an otherwise featureless ice surface. The range was first visited and partially surveyed in January 1958 during the Sentinel Mountains Traverse led by Charles R. Bentley. The entire range was subsequently mapped by USGS from aerial photography taken by the U.S. Navy, 1958-61.

<text>Klimavichy (; ; ) is a town in Mogilev Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Klimavichy District. Klimavichy is located east of Mogilev on the bank of the Kalinica River. In 2009, its population was 17,064. As of 2024, it has a population of 15,020.

==History==

First references in historical documents are dated by 1581 in relation to Mścisław Voivodship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was granted city status in 1777, and a coat of arms in 1781.
According to the census of 1897, the city had 4,714 inhabitants. 50.2 percent were Orthodox, 47.9 percent Jews and 1.5 percent Catholics.

It was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II on August 10, 1941, and liberated in October 1943.

In January 1939, there were 1,693 Jews in the village. There was a Yiddish school until 1938. The majority of the Jews were merchants. 
There were 4 executions of Jews in Klimovichi. At the end of August 1941, 13 Jews were arrested, taken to the Jewish cemetery in order to dig a pit. They were shot there afterwards. The second execution took place on November 6, 1941. Some Jews were sent to work and the remaining Jews were gathered in a garage near the hospital. Germans took their valuables. The Jews were then displaced near the airport, not far from the village of Dolgaya Gora and were shot by Germans and local policemen. On the same day, the Jews who were sent to work were shot at the same location. According to some sources, between 750 and 900 Jews were killed on that day. After this massacre, 80 Jews remained alive. They were concentrated in one house. At the end of November 1941, these Jews were forced to walk to Melovaya Gora, in the area of the town near the Lazhbanka River, and were shot. Some of those in the shooting were able to escape and run away. In April 1943, the children from mixed-families were imprisoned by the Germans and were shot on April 12, 1943.

<text>Marie Byrd Land (MBL) is an unclaimed region of Antarctica. With an area of , it is the largest unclaimed territory on Earth. It was named after the wife of American naval officer Richard E. Byrd, who explored the region in the early 20th century.

The territory lies in West Antarctica, east of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea and south of the Pacific Ocean portion of the Antarctic or Southern Ocean, extending eastward approximately to a line between the head of the Ross Ice Shelf and Eights Coast. It stretches between 158°W and 103°24&#x27;W. The inclusion of the area between the Rockefeller Plateau and Eights Coast is based upon Byrd&#x27;s exploration.

==Overview==
Because of its remoteness, even by Antarctic standards, most of Marie Byrd Land (the portion east of 150°W) has not been claimed by any sovereign state. It is by far the largest single unclaimed territory on Earth, with an area of , including Eights Coast, immediately east of Marie Byrd Land. In 1939, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt instructed members of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition to take steps to claim some of Antarctica as United States territory. Although this appears to have been done by members of this and subsequent expeditions, these do not appear to have been formalized prior to 1959, when the Antarctic Treaty System was set up. Some publications in the United States have shown this as a United States territory in the intervening period, and the United States Department of Defense has stated that the United States has a solid basis for a claim in Antarctica resulting from its activities prior to 1959. The portion west of 150°W is part of Ross Dependency claimed by New Zealand.

Five coastal areas are distinguished, which are listed from west to east:

==Exploration==
Marie Byrd Land was first explored from the west where it could be accessed from the Ross Sea. The far western coast of Marie Byrd Land was seen from the decks of Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s ship &quot;Discovery&quot; in 1902. He named the peninsula adjacent to the Ross Sea King Edward VII Land and the scattered outcrops that were within sight, the Alexandra Mountains. In 1911, during Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition, Kristian Prestrud led a sledge party that visited these isolated outcrops (nunataks) in the region bordering the eastern Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf. At the same time the first Japanese Antarctic Expedition led by Nobu Shirase landed a shore party on the peninsula.

Dean Smith was the pilot during aerial overflights in 1929 with Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s first Antarctic expedition (1928–1930). It originated from Little America near Amundsen&#x27;s original base camp &quot;Framheim&quot; in the Bay of Whales, led to the discovery of the Rockefeller Mountains and the Edsel Ford Ranges farther to the east. Byrd named the region after his wife Marie. A geological party led by L. Gould briefly explored parts of the Rockefeller Mountains.

The first deep overland exploration occurred during the second Byrd expedition (1933–1935) when a sledge party led by Paul Siple and Franklin Alton Wade reached as far east as the Fosdick Mountains in 1934. Aerial exploration discovered lands farther east along the Ruppert Coast.

The Third Byrd Antarctic Expedition, also called the United States Antarctic Service Expedition, took place from 1939 to 1941. This expedition established two base camps apart. West Base was near the former Little America base (68° 29&#x27; S, 163° 57&#x27; W) and East Base was near the Antarctic Peninsula on Stonington Island (68° 12&#x27; S, 67° 3&#x27; W). Exploration flights out of these two bases led to the discovery of most of the Marie Byrd Land Volcanic Province (e.g. Executive Committee Range) and much of the coastal region including the Walgreen, Hobbs, and Ruppert Coasts. During the expedition trail parties from West Base visited the northern Ford Ranges and south slopes of the Fosdick Mountains.

The United States Navy mounted several expeditions to Antarctica in the period 1946 to 1959. These expeditions (Operation Highjump led by R. E. Byrd, Windmill, and Deep Freeze I–IV) included aerial photography using the Trimetrogon system of aerial photographs (TMA; vertical, left, and right oblique images over the same point) over portions of coastal Marie Byrd Land.

The U.S. Navy began construction of Byrd Station at 80°S, 120°W with traverses out of Little America V in 1956–57 during Deep Freeze II. These efforts were in advance of the International Geophysical Year (IGY; from July 1957 to end of 1958) that saw several exploratory overland traverses with tractor trains (Sno-cats and modified bulldozers). Starting in January 1957 (pre-IGY) Charles R. Bentley led a traverse from Little America V to the new Byrd station along the route blazed by United States Army engineers a few months before (the Army-Navy Drive). His team conducted measurements of ice thickness and of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic and gravity field. The following summer season (1957–58) he led a second traverse out of Byrd Station that visited volcanoes of the Marie Byrd Land Volcanic Province for the first time. The traverse reached the Sentinel Mountains beyond eastern Marie Byrd Land before returning to Byrd Station. Bentley led a third traverse out of Byrd Station to the Horlick Mountains in 1958–59. These three traverses led to the discovery of the Bentley Subglacial Trench or Trough, a deep bedrock chasm between MBL and the Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica.

During 1958–1960 TMA flights and a traverse out of Byrd Station visited and mapped the Executive Committee Range. TMA were flown in western Marie Byrd Land in 1964 and 1965. Following these efforts the United States Geological Survey (USGS) mounted land surveys to establish a series of reference points and benchmarks throughout much of Marie Byrd Land during 1966–1968.

 explored the parts of the Walgreen Coast and Eights Coast in 1960–61. It had parties of geologists and surveyors along that were deployed to outcrops on land. This expedition to the far eastern reaches of Marie Byrd Land determined that Thurston Peninsula as proposed by earlier expeditions was in fact an island (Thurston Island). In the same season a geological party led by Campbell Craddock explored the Jones Mountains in the adjacent region.

The United States Byrd Coastal Survey during 1966–1969, led by F. A. Wade, conducted geologic mapping of the Alexandra and Rockefeller Mountains and the Ford Ranges and produced a series of 1:250,000 geologic maps of the region. This was a complex expedition involving remote helicopter camps and airborne geophysics.

Several geological expeditions explored Marie Byrd Land during the period 1978–1993. New Zealand geologists surveyed the Ford Ranges and Edward VII Peninsula in two expeditions, 1978–79 and 1987–88. Exploration of the Marie Byrd Land Volcanic Province began in earnest by U.S. geologists in 1984–85. The WAVE project (West Antarctic Volcano Exploration) focused on the volcanic province during the period 1989–1991. The SPRITE project (South Pacific Rim International Tectonic Expedition) explored regions and surroundings of the Hobbs Coast in 1990–1993. Members of both projects were from the U.S., Britain, and New Zealand. During the Austral summers of 1989–1990 and 1990–1991, a geological party from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) explored several of the mountain ranges within the northern Ford Ranges of Marie Byrd Land (FORCE expedition; Ford Ranges Crustal Exploration). GANOVEX VII a multinational expedition led by Germany visited Edward VII Peninsula in 1992–93.

Colorado College geologists led expeditions to the Ford Ranges in 1998–2001 (Ford Ranges), 2005–2007 and 2011–2013 (Fosdick Mountains).

==Research camps and stations==
Marie Byrd Land hosted the Operation Deep Freeze base Byrd Station (NBY; originally at 80°S, 120°W, rebuilt at 80°S, 119°W), beginning in 1957, in the hinterland of Bakutis Coast. Byrd Station was the only major base in the interior of West Antarctica for many years. In 1968, the first ice core to fully penetrate the Antarctic Ice Sheet was drilled here. The year-round station was abandoned in 1972, and after operating for years as a temporary summer encampment, Byrd Surface Camp, Byrd Station was reopened by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) in 2009–2010 to support operations in northern West Antarctica.

On Ruppert Coast of Marie Byrd Land is the Russian station Russkaya, which was occupied 1980–1990 and is now closed.

East of the Siple Coast off the Ross Ice Shelf, Siple Dome was established as a summer science camp in 1996. Ice cores have been drilled here to retrieve the climate history of the last 100,000 years. This camp also served as a base for airborne geophysical surveys supported by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).

In 1998–1999, a camp was operated at the Ford Ranges (FRD) in western Marie Byrd Land, supporting a part of a United States Antarctic Program (USAP) airborne survey initiated by UCSB and supported by the UTIG flying out of Siple Dome. 

In 2004–05, a large camp, Thwaites (THW) was established by the USAP north of NBY, in order to support a large airborne geophysical survey of eastern Marie Byrd Land by the UTIG.

In 2006, a major encampment, WAIS Divide (WSD) was established on the divide between the Ross Sea Embayment and the Amundsen Sea Embayment, in the easternmost portion of Marie Byrd Land, in order to drill a high resolution ice core. Drilling and coring ended in 2014.

In 2018, the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration commenced with a large and ongoing physical presence onshore of the Amundsen Sea. It entails marine, airborne, and on-ice geophysical exploration that will illuminate the character of Marie Byrd Land bedrock geology and the nature of the eastern boundary of the province. The goal is determining the stability of the glacier and prediction of global sea level rise from shrinking of the WAIS. 

==Geography and geology==
Adjacent to the continent, Marie Byrd Land is bordered by the Amundsen Sea in the east and the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf in the west. Mountain ranges are prominent along and near the coastline with a few exceptions. Marie Byrd Land is covered by the vast West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The WAIS in Marie Byrd Land drains off the continent to the east into the Ross Ice Shelf via seven ice streams. Along the coast of the Southern Ocean and the Amundsen Sea, ice drains via glaciers, the major one being the Thwaites. West Antarctica and Marie Byrd Land have elevations of up to 1.5 to 2 kilometers on the surface of the WAIS. In contrast, East Antarctica has interior elevations on its ice sheet of over 4 kilometers.

The West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) that evolved over the last hundred million years, includes all or part of Marie Byrd Land. The WARS extends from the Ross Sea continental shelf east into Marie Byrd Land. The ice streams and glaciers that drain the WAIS have been proposed to follow rift valleys, now buried by ice, which formed in the WARS. The WARS contains a volcanic province with volcanoes active from the Eocene epoch to a few thousand years ago.

A mantle plume was discovered deep below Marie Byrd Land. Heat from the plume has been proposed responsible for uplift of a significant portion of West Antarctica to form the Marie Byrd Land Dome.

A digital map of Antarctica includes the geology of Marie Byrd Land. The geologic history of Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica was summarized in a 2020 publication.

=== Glaciers, ice streams, and ice shelves ===
Prominent glaciers that drain the WAIS in MBL include the Thwaites, and also the Pine Island Glacier, both of which empty into the Amundsen Sea. Of the seven ice streams that drain into the Ross Ice Shelf, the Bindschadler and Whillans ice streams are the most extensive. The seven ice streams discharge 40 percent of the WAIS. Besides the Ross Ice Shelf, significant ice shelves on the coast of the Southern Ocean include the Sulzberger, and Nickerson.

=== Mountain ranges, peaks, summits, and sub-ice topography ===
Due to the burial of the continental basement of MBL by the WAIS, mountain ranges are exposed towards the coast of MBL where ice thickness is smaller. Prominent ranges include the Ford Ranges in western MBL, The Flood Range, the Executive Committee Range, and the Kohler Range. The Ford Ranges are the most extensive and include more than six individual named mountain groups. The Executive Committee Range includes five volcanoes, some proposed to be dormant or active. The Flood Range comprises a linear chain of Neogene and Quaternary age volcanoes. The Fosdick mountains in the northern Ford Ranges are a 30-kilometer-long span of Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. Most other exposed rock in MBL is Paleozoic metamorphosed sedimentary rock and granitoid, and Mesozoic granitoid. 

Away from the coasts, the WAIS buries individual mountains and ranges that are not named, the exception being major features such as the Bentley Subglacial Trench.

Marie Byrd Seamount () is a seamount named in association with Marie Byrd Land; name approved June 1988 (Advisory Committee on Undersea Features, 228).

<doc id="1130857" wikidata="Q999005" url="?curid=1130857" title="Bay of Whales">
<text>The Bay of Whales was a natural ice harbour, or iceport, indenting the front of the Ross Ice Shelf just north of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica, at the southernmost point of the world&#x27;s ocean. While the Ross Sea stretches considerably further south – encompassing the Gould Coast, located around from the South Pole – the majority of this expanse is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf, rather than open sea.

==Discovery and naming==
Ernest Shackleton named the feature on January 24, 1908, during the Nimrod Expedition, because of the large number of whales seen near this location.

==History==
During his quest for the South Pole, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen established a temporary base, which he named Framheim, at the Bay of Whales. The base was used between January 1911February 1912, and was named after Amundsen&#x27;s ship &quot;Fram&quot;.

The Bay of Whales was a logistical support base for Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s first (1928–1930), second (1933–1935) and third expedition (1939–1941)

The configuration of the Bay of Whales continuously changed. A survey by the second Byrd expedition in 1934 determined that the feature lay at the junction of two separate ice systems, the movements of which are influenced by the presence of Roosevelt Island. Commander Glen Jacobsen, USN, who visited aboard the USS &quot;Atka&quot; in January 1955, found that calving of the ice shelf rendered the iceport temporarily unusable.

The Bay of Whales was entirely eliminated in 1987 when the Iceberg B-9 broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf.

The Whale Bay Furrows, a series of undersea valleys on the central Ross continental shelf, were named in association with the Bay of Whales.

<doc id="1130867" wikidata="Q1345015" url="?curid=1130867" title="Emasculation">
<text>Emasculation is the removal of the external male sex organs, which includes both the penis and the scrotum, the latter of which contains the testicles. It is distinct from castration, where only the testicles are removed. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the potential medical consequences of emasculation are more extensive due to the complications arising from the removal of the penis. There are a range of religious, cultural, punitive, and personal reasons why someone may choose to emasculate themselves or another person.

The term &quot;emasculation&quot; may be used in a metaphorical sense, referring to the perceived loss of attributes traditionally associated with masculinity, such as strength, power, or autonomy.

== Method ==
There are several different methods of emasculation. Both the penis and testicles may be removed simultaneously using a sharp instrument, such as a knife or razor or swords. Non-crushing vascular clamps may also be used in medical surgery to cut off blood circulation and reduce bleeding.

Alternatively, the penis and testicles may be removed during a series of stages. Medical surgeons use this method when performing surgery on trans women who want their genitals removed over multiple sex reassignment surgeries (male-to-female), rather than in a single operation. In these surgeries, the tissue is used and re-shaped into the neo-vagina and vulva.

== Medical consequences ==
Short-term consequences of emasculation include bleeding and infection. Historically, death was also a potential complication, although the prevalence is disputed.

Long term complications include incontinence, urethral stricture, urine retention, urinary tract infection, urine extravasation and bladder stones. Some studies have found that emasculation may cause a range of physiological changes, such as a shortened torso, widened stomach and hips, increased height, bowed legs, and an elongated skull. Additionally, emasculates typically have less or no facial and body hair, increased fatty tissue or gynecomastia, and a feminine fat pattern distribution. The physiological effects of emasculation are more severe for people who undergo the procedure before the onset of puberty.

== Reasons ==

=== Cultural ===
==== Imperial China ====
Emasculation was performed in China on men to create palace eunuchs for the imperial court. The practice dates back to the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC) and continued up until 1924, when the eunuch system was abolished by the last emperor of China, Puyi. The last living palace eunuch, Sun Yaoting, died in 1996.

Originally, palace eunuchs were prisoners who were involuntarily emasculated. In the Qing dynasty, men began volunteering to undergo the procedure in order to gain employment, although instances of forced emasculation still occurred. One reason why recipients willingly underwent emasculation is that they saw employment as a palace eunuch as a way to acquire wealth and power. Alternatively, poverty was a reason why fathers forced their sons to undergo emasculation, and the desire for financial benefit motivated human traffickers to force emasculation on their victims.

There were several reasons why the Imperial court required its civil servants to be emasculated. Emasculation was thought to ensure a recipient&#x27;s undivided loyalty to the emperor, as it severs the recipient&#x27;s existing familial or social bonds and destroys their ability to produce future heirs. The choice to hire emasculated eunuchs also ensured the legitimacy of the emperor&#x27;s lineage. The choice to emasculate, rather than merely castrate, was motivated by a desire to protect the chastity of women in the court, as emasculation rendered a recipient physically incapable of having sex. While emasculation was a pre-requisite for gaining employment as a palace eunuch, it did not guarantee employment.

The emasculation procedure was typically performed by a trained &#x27;knifer&#x27;, or &#x27;knife expert&#x27;. To prepare for the operation, the recipient was bathed in cold water to numb his senses and, in some instances, his genitals were twisted to reduce blood flow. The recipient was then asked if he consented to the procedure, and if he answered yes the knifer excised the genitals with a single cut. Styptic powder was then applied to the wound to stop bleeding, and a pewter needle or spigot was inserted into the urethra to prevent stenosis (narrowing).

Some Chinese emasculates were the great historian Sima Qian, Cao Teng, the foster grandfather of Cao Cao, Zheng He, a Ming dynasty admiral of the imperial navy who sailed to Africa, and the surviving sons and grandson of rebel Yaqub Beg.

==== West Asia ====
To create eunuchs for the Arab slave trade, young black boys from South East Africa typically had their penis and scrotum amputated. White boys, by comparison, were usually only castrated.

=== Religious ===
==== Skoptsy ====
Emasculation was one form of genital mutilation practiced by the Skoptsy, a Russian Christian sect. For males, the other form of mutilation available was castration. Females could remove their nipples, breasts, labia majora, labia minora or clitoris. These practices may have begun sometime during the 1760s, after the sect was founded by Kondratii Selivanov, although they were only discovered by the broader community in 1772. They continued up until the 1930s, when the sect was destroyed and its members sentenced.

The Skoptsy practiced genital mutilation because they believed the genitals were the source of original sin, and that by removing them, they could attain salvation. The aim of removing the offending genitalia was to purify the body. Their belief was based on a literal reading of the verse of Matthew 19:12, which states: &quot;There are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother&#x27;s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven&#x27;s sake.&quot; In addition, the verses of Matthew 18:8,9 and Luke 23:29 were also cited as support. Of the two types of genital mutilation available to men, emasculation was called the Greater Seal. Castration, by comparison, was called the Lesser Seal. Emasculation was preferable because it rendered a recipient physically incapable of engaging in sinful sexual conduct, allowing them to attain a higher level of purity.

Originally, the emasculation procedure was performed by burning the testicles off with an iron. Later, the genitals were tied at the base and removed using a knife or razor blade. The wound was then cauterised, or a salve was applied, to prevent bleeding. Many Skoptsy were peasants and were familiar with animal husbandry, which meant their emasculation procedures were often performed with &quot;surgical precision.&quot; In some instances, members of the Skoptsy would perform the emasculation on themselves, in an act of self-surgery, though it was more typical for the procedure to be performed by an elder during a ceremony.

==== Hijra ====

Throughout the Indian subcontinent tradition, including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, some members of the Hijra community reportedly undergo emasculation, or &quot;nirvan.&quot;

Traditionally, emasculation was a rite of passage into the Hijra community. Today it remains an important ritual, though is not mandatory or universally practiced. When it is performed, it typically occurs several years after an individual has already participated within the Hijra community. While some Hijra are emasculated, others are intersex, undeveloped in puberty or impotent.

Whether or not a Hijra undergoes emasculation is influenced by a range of considerations. Some people are not emasculated because they are fearful of surgical complications, are under financial constraints, or merely as a matter of personal choice. For Muslim Hijra, emasculation may be avoided due to the belief that genital mutilation goes against Allah&#x27;s will.
Others see emasculation as necessary in order to be &#x27;reborn&#x27; as a Hijra. In this view, emasculated Hijra are seen as more &#x27;real&#x27; than those who are not. The decision to be emasculated may also be motivated by personal beliefs about whether a Hijra can have spiritual powers without undergoing the procedure. Amongst members of the Hijra community, this issue is subject to considerable debate.

In the past, the emasculation procedure was performed by barbers or by the individual themselves (i.e. self-emasculation). Nowadays, the operation is performed by a Hijra elder, also called a &quot;dai ma&quot; (midwife). They have no medical training, but believe they operate with the power of the patron goddess, Bahuchara Mata. The operation takes place early in the morning, around 3a.m. or 4a.m. Anesthesia is not administered. The penis and testes are tied together with a string, and the elder then makes two diagonal cuts with a sharp surgical knife to completely excise the organs. The elder allows the blood to gush from the wound, which is considered necessary to completely cleanse the recipient of their male parts. This is one reason why the procedure is performed by an elder rather than a medical professional, who might try to stop the haemorrhage, thus interfering with the ritual&#x27;s cleansing effect. Afterwards, no stitches are taken and the wound is left exposed, although a small stick is inserted into the urethra to prevent urethral stricture.

=== Punishment ===

==== Ancient China ====

Emasculation was one of the Five Punishments used in ancient China. It was the prescribed punishment for people who engaged in licentious conduct, such as infidelity or rape. The first evidence of its use dates to the Shang dynasty (1700–1100 BC), when the characters for a knife and male genitalia were carved into oracle bones. It continued up until the Sui dynasty (581–618 CE), when it was formally abolished.

==== Europe ====
=== Self-inflicted ===
==== Mental disorder ====
There are reports of self-emasculation cases resulting from mental disorder. Some academics claim that a majority of self-emasculations are a result of psychosis, although this finding has been challenged. Nonetheless, there are several reported cases of people with schizophrenia engaging in self-emasculation. 

It has been linked to other mental disorders such as dissociative identity disorder.

Klingsor syndrome (sometimes known as Skotpic syndrome) is a condition where people mutilate their genitals as a result of psychotic religious delusions. For example, in one case a person is reported to have mutilated his genitals after experiencing auditory hallucinations telling him he would only be allowed into the kingdom of heaven if he emasculated himself.

Body integrity dysphoria, or xenomelia, is another mental disorder that may drive a person to seek emasculation. People with this disorder are distressed by the presence of a limb that they do not identify as part of their body, including the genitals. Emasculation in this context alleviates their distress, enabling them to become &#x27;whole&#x27;. However, the amputation of healthy limbs by medical professionals is highly controversial. The inability to acquire medically administered emasculation has driven some to self-emasculation.

Occasionally, self-emasculation is practiced by those suffering from gender dysphoria. When compared with the general population, transgender persons are at a higher risk of engaging in acts of genital self-mutilation, including self-emasculation.

In some cases, a person with a mental illness has emasculated other people.

=== Transgender ===
Emasculation occurs voluntarily within the transgender community as a form of gender reassignment surgery, allowing recipients to renounce their masculine characteristics and bring their body into closer alignment with their identified gender. It may be sought by trans women (biological males who identify as female), who wish to assume their femininity, or by non-binary transgender individuals (biological males who identify as neither male nor female), who want to locate themselves outside of traditional gender categories.

For trans women, emasculation surgery may be performed with or without the creation of a vagina. When a vagina is created, the procedure is called a vaginoplasty, and where it is not, the procedure is called a vulvoplasty.

For non-binary transgender people, the purpose of emasculation is to make the body less congruent with one&#x27;s biological sex without the subsequent assumption of femininity. These individuals may identify as non-binary, a third-sex, eunuch, or another gender. Some adopt the term &#x27;nullo&#x27;, meaning someone whose gender has been nullified.

=== Involuntary or accidental ===
In some circumstances, a person may be emasculated involuntarily as the result of an accident, as part of a ritual attack, or due to poor circumcision practice.

In these cases, the objective of medical treatment is different than for cases of voluntary emasculation. The goals of treatment are to either reattach the severed genitals or to reconstruct an artificial penis and testes.

From 1960 to 2000, involuntarily emasculated infants were surgically reassigned female, similar to the treatment received by David Reimer after his penis was burnt off during a circumcision procedure. It is now understood from cases like Reimer&#x27;s that gender reassignment surgery in infancy can interfere with gender identity formation. Therefore, gender reassignment is no longer the standard practice for involuntarily emasculated infants.

==Other meanings==
By extension, the word &quot;emasculation&quot; has also come to mean rendering a male less masculine, including by humiliation. It can also mean to deprive anything of vigour or effectiveness. This figurative usage has become more common than the literal meaning. For example: &quot;William Lewis Hughes voted for Folkestone&#x27;s amendment to Curwen&#x27;s emasculated reform bill, 12 June 1809 ... &quot;

In horticulture, the removal of male (pollen) parts of a plant, largely for controlled pollination and breeding purposes, is also called emasculation.

<text>Anti EP is the second EP by British electronic music duo Autechre, released by Warp on 3 September 1994. It peaked at number 90 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as number 39 on the UK Dance Singles Chart. It is the only explicitly political record Autechre have released.

==Background==
&quot;Anti EP&quot; was a protest against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which would prohibit raves (described as gatherings where music is played), with &quot;music&quot; being defined as a &quot;succession of repetitive beats.&quot; Sean Booth explained the band&#x27;s strategy for the song &quot;Flutter&quot; by saying, &quot;We made as many different bars as we could on the drum machine, then strung them all together.&quot;

The packaging bore a sticker with a disclaimer about the repetitive nature of the rhythmic elements of &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Djarum&quot;. &quot;Flutter&quot; was programmed to have non-repetitive beats and therefore &quot;can be played at both forty five and thirty three revolutions under the proposed law&quot;; but following their disclaimer, it was advised that DJs &quot;have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment.&quot; The sticker acted as a seal, which was required to be broken in order to access the media enclosed in the packaging.

The profits from this release went to the political pressure group Liberty. The sticker ended with this last statement: &quot;Autechre is politically non-aligned. This is about personal freedom.&quot;

Despite &quot;Flutter&quot;&#x27;s ability to be played at 33 1/3 RPM and 45 RPM on vinyl, the CD version contains the song as played at 45 RPM.

==Critical reception==

Ken Tataki of AllMusic gave the EP 4 stars out of 5, saying, &quot;Beyond a doubt, this is an excellent showcase not only for the band, but also for the label that signed them.&quot; Writing for &quot;Fact&quot; in 2013, Maya Kalev called the EP &quot;a continued reminder of dance music&#x27;s extra-linguistic and innate potential for subversion.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Fact&quot; placed &quot;Flutter&quot; at number 1 on their list of the &quot;100 greatest IDM tracks&quot;.

Economically, Central Queensland is an important centre of primary sector industries, particularly for food and fibre production. Central Queensland includes the Bowen Basin which is rich in high quality coking coal, the Port of Gladstone produces 40% of the state&#x27;s export earnings, the Fitzroy River is the second-largest river system in Australia and commands significant water resources such as Fairbairn Dam. Gladstone has a significant aluminium smelter.

===Beef===
Rockhampton is claimed to be the beef capital of Australia, a title which is disputed by Casino in New South Wales. Beef production in the region is centred on Brigalow and speargrass land types. Every three years, Rockhampton holds the national Beef Australia exposition to celebrate the cattle industry as well as to facilitate trade opportunities for Australian beef producers.

===Mining===

Central Queensland is one of the world&#x27;s leading producers and exporters of black coal. Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to discover coal deposits in the region in 1845. In the 2011-2012 financial year the region produced 40% of the state&#x27;s total coal production.

Coal is extracted from the Bowen Basin and transported to port facilities at Port of Gladstone via the Blackwater railway system or to both Hay Point and Abbot Point via the Goonyella railway line. Coal mining is expanding west into the Galilee Basin and requires an extension of the Goonyella line to transport coal to port. Many mines in the region, particularly those within the Fitzroy River basin, were severely impacted by flooding during the 2010–11 Queensland floods.

Gold, silver, limestone, coal seam gas, magnesite and gemstones are also mined. Sapphires were discovered here in 1875. Gold was discovered in the Mount Morgan region around 1865. Mount Morgan Mine has since gone on to become one of Australia&#x27;s richest mines.

Purpose-built mining towns in Central Queensland include Dysart, Middlemount, Moranbah, Mount Morgan and Moura. Three mining disaster have occurred at Moura since 1975, resulting in the loss of 36 lives.

===Citrus canker outbreak===

In 2004, an orchard on Evergreen farm was the site of the first detection of citrus canker in Central Queensland. A significant part of the citrus growing industry was devastated when a total of of crop had to be destroyed so the disease would not spread across the country. In 2005 several fresh outbreaks were reported so the eradication expanded to include private backyard trees. The outbreak&#x27;s cause has not been fully explained despite a federal inquiry. In 2009 authorities from the Government of Queensland declared the eradication program complete.

==Protected areas==
The region contain 33 national parks. Great Keppel Island has been an island tourist attraction since the 1960s. It and several other islands in the area are surrounded by coral reefs. In the west of the region is Queensland&#x27;s central highlands and the Carnarvon Gorge, which is protected within the Carnarvon National Park. Carnarvon Gorge features white sandstone cliffs, steep-sided gorges a diverse range of significant plant and animal species and many walking tracks. Kroombit Tops National Park provides habitat for the endemic Kroombit tinker frog. Deepwater National Park is good place for turtle watching. From November to March three species of turtle lay their eggs on beaches protected within the park.
==Communities==
For this purpose the area of Central Queensland was restricted to the areas encircled by the Dawson Highway between Gladstone and Springsure; the Gregory Highway between Springsure and Clermont, and the Peak Downs Highway between Clermont and enters North Queensland via Mackay – extended right to the eastern coastline.

Major cities in the region are Emerald, Gladstone and Rockhampton. Some communities on the Capricorn Coast include Byfield, Yeppoon, Great Keppel Island, Emu Park and Cawarral.

In 1889 Central Queenslanders in Rockhampton established the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League with the hopes of turning Central Queensland into its own state. The core argument of secessionist movement was that the seat of government, Brisbane was in the south-east corner of the State. It was so far removed from substantial portions of the state that these areas and their citizens were left disadvantaged and neglected as political and economic interests focused on the south. Supplementing the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League, the women of Rockhampton established their own separation league in October 1892. Their main focus was preparing a petition to Queen Victoria.  The introductory text set out their grievances and described the immense size of Queensland: being twelve times the area of England and Wales, and larger than France, Germany, Spain and Portugal combined.

<doc id="1130878" wikidata="Q1255380" url="?curid=1130878" title="Nacho Vidal">
<text>Ignacio Jordà González (born 30 December 1973), better known as Nacho Vidal, is a Spanish pornographic actor and director.

==Early life==
Ignacio Jordà González was born in Mataró (Barcelona) in Catalonia. His nickname Nacho is the common nickname for Ignacio.

When he was young, Jordà moved with his family to Valencia, where part of his family originated. According to Nacho Vidal, his family was wealthy, had textile factories and extensive real estate assets, but ended up losing their wealth due to 1970s energy crisis, and at 14, he quit school to work and help his family.

As a teenager, he was in a punk band. He also was a boxer and enlisted in the Spanish Legion in Melilla.

==Career==
In 1994, Vidal started his porn career doing live sex shows with his girlfriend, Sara Bernat (born 1976), at the Sala Bagdad in Barcelona. There, he met the director of the Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival, José María Ponce, who introduced him to porn films. Vidal became a &quot;protégé&quot; of Rocco Siffredi, who brought him to Hollywood in 1998.

Vidal has starred in over 1,500 movies; he has also produced and/or directed many others (since 2000, including gay titles for the Evil Angel video company). Although self-stated as heterosexual, he has directed gay porn films.

Vidal has starred in Spanish mainstream movies and TV shows, including the Spanish TV series &quot;Los Simuladores&quot; and the Spanish movies &quot;Va a ser que nadie es perfecto,&quot; &quot;El Alquimista Impaciente&quot; and &quot;Impávido&quot;.

The 8-part Spanish-language TV series &quot;Nacho&quot; describes Vidal&#x27;s life and was released in Spain and Latin America in March 2023, with Vidal being portrayed by Martiño Rivas.

Recently Nacho has moved into the director&#x27;s chair, helming his own shot-in-Europe line called &quot;Killer Pussy&quot;. He directs and stars in the flicks, bringing audiences the cream of the crop of current European sex stars. The series has already won accolades, as Nacho&#x27;s ravenous romp with Czech beauty Helen in Killer Pussy (2000), which garnered an AVN nomination for Best Sex Scene in a Foreign Release.

==Personal life==

Vidal has stated that he is &quot;open-minded&quot;, but is heterosexual in his personal life. He had his first daughter with Venezuelan Rosa Castro Camacho.

On 31 May 2005, Vidal announced his retirement from pornography and married Colombian model Franceska Jaimes. They moved to a mansion previously owned by his family, located in the small town of Enguera, in Valencia, recovering it after his family&#x27;s financial losses. He and his wife decided to start a family there. However, the couple separated six weeks later, and Vidal returned to porn only a few months after announcing his retirement. They have two children, and divorced in 2015.

In February 2019, a Spanish newspaper stated that Nacho Vidal is HIV-positive. Later that year, in a 12-minute YouTube video, he clarified that his test was a false positive. He found after visits to a series of doctors that he has reactive arthritis, a highly painful, sometimes chronic or lifelong condition. This inflammatory syndrome is often triggered by a prior, treatable infection which may itself resolve (be healed). In Vidal&#x27;s case, he explains, it was repeated infections by the STDs chlamydia and gonorrhea contracted during his sex work, each instance having been quickly treated and cured. Because of the disease he cannot work and is seeking disability benefits.

In 2019, Vidal, Jaimes, and their trans-daughter Violeta were portrayed in the documentary &quot;Me llamo Violeta.&quot;

==Legal problems==
On 16 October 2012, Vidal and his sister María José Jordá González were arrested in Barcelona, suspected of involvement in money laundering and tax evasion on behalf of Chinese organized crime.
When Spanish police raided over 100 businesses in Madrid and Barcelona suspected of running money-laundering and tax evasion rackets in connection with the Chinese mob, Vidal and his sister were among the approximately 80 detained. Hundreds of police were involved in serving &quot;warrants to search 120 properties belonging to those suspected of laundering money from prostitution and extortion.&quot;

While prosecutors sought to hold Vidal in jail during the investigation and subsequent trial, on 19 October 2012, National Court Judge Fernando Andreu accepted the defense&#x27;s contention that, &quot;Vidal is not a flight risk because he signed a contract to participate in a reality show for the next three months.&quot; Upon his no-bail release, Vidal announced, &quot;Thanks to everyone for their support. I&#x27;ve gone without any charge.&quot;

Vidal&#x27;s movie studio Nacho Vidal Productions was implicated in the Spanish National Court-led sting, and charged with counts of flight of capital and tax evasion. The newspaper &quot;El País&quot; described Vidal as &quot;one of the high[est]-profile suspects arrested&quot; and explained that he was accused along with his sister of helping the ring &quot;by issuing false invoices from his movie production company.&quot;

On 4 June 2020, Vidal was arrested on manslaughter charges in relation to the death of a fashion photographer, José Luis Abad, in July 2019. Abad died as a result of inhaling vapors from the venom of a Colorado River toad in Vidal&#x27;s home in Enguera, in a traditional Amazonian ritual in which Vidal is alleged to have acted as shaman. Vidal was arrested together with two other unnamed individuals, a member of his family and an employee. A different news story says the death was from heart attack; the crime was not promptly calling in medical assistance.

In March 2021, Spanish authorities officially charged Vidal with reckless homicide in the death of Abad following an 11-month investigation. According to court statements, Vidal acted as &quot;the director&quot; of the ritual and had previous experience in taking the toxin. Vidal allegedly supplied the toxin and failed to properly control the amount the victim inhaled during the ceremony. The charges were dismissed in 2023.

<doc id="1130885" wikidata="Q1072053" url="?curid=1130885" title="I Was Born to Love You (song)">
<text>&quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot; is a 1985 song by Freddie Mercury that was released as a single from his first solo album, &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;. After Mercury&#x27;s death, Queen re-worked this song for their album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; in 1995, by having the other members play their instrumental parts over the original track. The Queen version from the &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; album also includes snippets of Mercury&#x27;s ad-lib vocals taken from &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; and from &quot;Living on My Own&quot;.

The song received its live debut on the 2005 tour of Japan, given by Queen + Paul Rodgers. Brian May and Roger Taylor performed the song acoustically. The song was also performed during the concerts given by Queen + Adam Lambert in South Korea and Japan, which was the first time that a full live band was used for the performance.

==Music videos==
The video for the original Freddie Mercury version of the song was directed by David Mallet and filmed at the now demolished Limehouse Studios, London. The video was choreographed by Arlene Phillips and shows Mercury singing in front of a wall of mirrors, then running through a house with a woman (Debbie Ash of Hot Gossip), before dancing on a podium.

The video for the version used on &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; was directed by Richard Heslop for the British Film Institute, and included on &quot;Made in Heaven: The Films&quot;. It shows inhabitants of a block of council flats. Couples kiss, kids play, and teenagers steal and destroy a car in a monochrome film. The audio also uses the vinyl edit.

For the 2004 re-release, a video was created mixing footage of Mercury&#x27;s original solo video intercut with footage of Queen performing live at Wembley Stadium, plus his solo video &quot;Living on My Own&quot;. This video is included on &quot;Queen Jewels&quot;, the 2004 Greatest Karaoke Hits DVD, and the Japanese release of the documentary &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
The song has appeared in multiple television advertisements, mainly in Japan. The original version recorded by Mercury appeared in the TV commercial of Japanese cosmetics company Noevia in the mid 1980s. The Queen version was released as a single exclusively in Japan in February 1996, because the song was used in a TV ad for Kirin Ichiban Shibori, one of the best-selling liquors of the country produced by the Kirin Brewery Company. The single became their first song that entered the Japanese chart since &quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)&quot;, released in 1977.

In 2004, Queen&#x27;s version was used as the theme for &quot;Pride&quot;, the successful Japanese drama starring Takuya Kimura and Yūko Takeuchi. &quot;Jewels&quot;, Queen&#x27;s tie-in compilation album released only in Japan, includes &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;.

In Malaysia, Mercury&#x27;s version, using a different mix, was used by Astro in TV advertisements to promote their coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The advertisement, commissioned by Astro through agency Dentsu LHS Malaysia and created by Pesona Pictures Indonesia, also have an unused version, which used Queen&#x27;s version of the song.

<text>Dundee Island () is an ice-covered island lying east of the northeastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and south of Joinville Island, Antarctica.
==Location==

Dundee Island is in the Joinville Island group in Graham Land.
It is south of Joinville Island and east of the Trinity Peninsula, which in turn is the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
It is separated from Joinville Island by Active Sound and the Firth of Tay, and separated from Trinity Peninsula by the Antarctic Sound.
Features include the Petrel Base (Argentina) and Cape Purvis in the south.
Nearby features include Eden Rocks and Paulet Island.

==Early history==
Dundee Island was discovered on Jan. 8, 1893 by Captain Thomas Robertson of the &quot;Active&quot; and named for the home port, Dundee, Scotland, from whence the ship sailed in company with three other vessels in search of whales.
It is from this island that the American businessman Lincoln Ellsworth, accompanied by the pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, took off on the 20 November 1935 for the first crossing of the Antarctic by plane.

==Petrel Base==

The Petrel Base is a scientific station in Antarctica belonging to Argentina. 
Its coordinates are and it is located on Welchness cape, Petrel Cove, the only area on Dundee Island that is free of ice and has access to the sea. The area has a diverse bird population. Weddell seals and leopard seals are sometimes seen near the coast.
It was established as Petrel Refuge in December 1952, with a small airstrip.
The airstrip was extended in summer of 1966–67, and a large metal hangar and other buildings were erected.
The base was evacuated after a fire in the winter of 1974, and became a temporary summer station in February 1978.
The base infrastructure has under roof, a logistics area and 25 beds.

== Features ==

Features and nearby features include, clockwise from the west:

===Welchness===
A gravel spit which forms the west extremity of Dundee Island. 
Roughly charted by the Dundee whaling expedition (1892-93) and named after Captain George Welch (d.1891), a leading Dundee whaler and Manager, from about 1860 onward, of the Jay Whale Fishing Company, which for many years owned the &quot;Dundee&quot; whaling expedition ship Active.

===Petrel Cove===
A small coastal indentation at the west end of Dundee Island between Welchness and Diana Reef on Joinville Island. 
The cove is adjacent to the Argentine station &quot;Petrel,&quot; established in 1951-52, from which it takes its name.

===Active Reef===
An isolated reef lying in the Firth of Tay, just off the north coast of Dundee Island. 
Discovered and named by Thomas Robertson, master of the Active, one of the ships of the Dundee whaling expedition of 1892-93. 
The Active ran onto this reef during a gale on January 10, 1893 and lay there for 6 hours before she could be gotten off.

===Cape Purvis===
A cape forming the south extremity of Dundee Island. 
Discovered in December 1842 by Captain James Ross, and named by him for Commodore (later Rear Admiral) John B. Purvis, Royal Navy, who was of assistance to Ross&#x27; expedition.

<doc id="1130891" wikidata="Q887590" url="?curid=1130891" title="Joinville Island">
<text>Joinville Island () is the largest island of the Joinville Island group, about long in an east–west direction and wide, lying off the northeastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, from which it is separated by the Antarctic Sound.
==Location==
Joinville Island lies in Graham Land to the east of the tip of Trinity Peninsula, which is itself the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The Antarctic Sound separates it from the Trinity Peninsula.
D&#x27;Urville Island is to the north, Danger Islands to the east and Dundee Island to the west.
Northern features include Cape Kinnes, Boral Point, King Point and Fitzroy Point.
Southern features include Mount Percy, Mount Quilmes, Tay Head and Moody Point.
==Sailing directions==
The US Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1976) describes Joinville Island as follows:
==Discovery and name==
Joinville Island was discovered and charted roughly during 1838 by a French expedition commanded by Captain Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, who named it for François d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Joinville (1818–1900), the third son of Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans.

==Northern features==
Features in the north of the island, from west to east, include:

===Cape Kinnes===
A cape which forms the west extremity of Joinville Island, off the northeast end of Antarctic Peninsula. 
Named by members of the Dundee whaling expedition 1892–93, for R. Kinnes, sponsor of the expedition.

===Madder Cliffs===
Reddish rock cliffs rising steeply from the sea to about high and forming the north side of the entrance to Suspires Bay, at the west end of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1953-54. 
The name, given in 1956 by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC), is descriptive of the red color of the rocks, madder being a red vegetable dye.

===Suspiros Bay===
A small bay indenting the west end of Joinville Island just south of Madder Cliffs. 
The name was proposed by Captain Emilio L. Díaz, commander of the Argentine Antarctic task force (1951-52).
The toponym alludes to the difficulties encountered in surrounding the bay.

===Balaena Valley===
A gently sloping valley, filled with ice, lying east of Suspires Bay in the west part of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953-54.
The Balaena (Alexander Fairweather, master) was one of the Dundee whaling ships that visited the Joinville Island group in 1892-93. 
The name was applied in 1956 by the UK-APC and derives from association with Cape Kinnes to the SW; Robert Kinnes was the Dundee shipowner and merchant who equipped these ships for their Antarctic voyage.

===Saxum Nunatak===
An isolated nunatak, high, standing north of Mount Tholus on the north side of Joinville Island. 
It is dome-shaped when seen from the south, but has a conspicuous rock wall on its northern side.

===Boreal Point===
A point forming the west side of Rockpepper Bay, along the north coast of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953-54. 
The feature was so named by the UK-APC because of its position on the north coast of Joinville Island.

===Rockpepper Bay===
A bay wide at its entrance, lying east of Boreal Point along the north coast of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953-54. 
So named by the UK-APC because of the very many small islands and rocks in the bay.

===King Point===
A point marking the west side of the entrance to Ambush Bay on the north coast of Joinville Island. 
Discovered on December 30, 1842 by a British expedition under Ross, who named it Cape King for Captain (later Rear Admiral) Phillip Parker King, RN, 1793-1856, English naval surveyor who made notable improvements to the charts of Australia and South America.

===Ambush Bay===
A bay wide indenting the north coast of Joinville Island immediately east of King Point. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953. 
The name arose because the bay is a trap for the unwary if its shallow and foul nature is not known.

===Fliess Bay===
A bay lying immediately west of Fitzroy Point along the north coast of Joinville Island. 
The name appears on an Argentine government chart of 1957. 
Named &quot;Caleta Almirante Fliess&quot; after Admiral Felipe Fliess (1878-1952) who, as a lieutenant, was commander of the Argentine navy group detached for duty with the crew of the ship Uruguay in 1903, on the occasion of the rescue expedition to the members of the SwedAE (1901-04) led by Doctor Otto Nordenskjold.

===Fitzroy Point===
A low point at the east side of Fliess Bay forming the northeast extremity of Joinville Island. 
Discovered on December 30, 1842 by a British expedition under James Clark Ross, who named it Cape Fitzroy for Captain (later Vice Admiral) Robert Fitzroy, RN (1805-65), English hydrographer and meteorologist.

==Southern features==
===D&#x27;Urville Monument===

===Nodule Nunatak===
A small but prominent isolated nunatak, high, standing south of Mount Tholus in the southern part of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953-54. The descriptive name was given by the UK-APC in 1956.

===Mount Tholus===
The highest mountain, high, in the ridge extending southwest from Postern Gap in the central part of Joinville Island. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953-54 and named by the UK-APC in 1956. 
The name is descriptive, &quot;tholus&quot; being a circular, domed structure.

===Postern Gap===
A pass in the central ridge of Joinville Island, just east of Mount Tholus. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1954. 
So named by the UK-APC because this is the only way through the ridge which gives access to the central part of the south coast of Joinville Island.

===Gibson Bay===
A small bay on the south side of Joinville Island, lying just west of Mount Alexander at the junction of Active Sound and the Firth of Tay.
Discovered and named on January 8, 1893 by Thomas Robertson, master of the ship &quot;Active&quot;, one of the Dundee whalers.

===Mount Percy===
A prominent mountain, high, the highest feature on Joinville Island, standing immediately north of Mount Alexander near the center of the island. 
Discovered by a British expedition under Ross on December 30, 1842, and named for Rear Admiral the Honorable Josceline Percy, RN, 1784-1856. 
Although this mountain is not surmounted by twin peaks, as described by Ross, there are a number of peaks of similar height in its vicinity, one of which may have given rise to Ross&#x27; description.

===Mount Alexander===
A mountain with several summits, the highest high, forming the rocky peninsula separating Gibson Bay and Haddon Bay, on the south side of Joinville Island. 
The cliff marking the extremity of the peninsula was discovered and named Cape Alexander on January 8, 1893 by Thomas Robertson, master of the ship Active, one of the Dundee whalers. 
The name was amended to Mount Alexander by the UK-APC in 1956 following a survey by the FIDS in 1953-54, the mountain summits of the peninsula being considered more suitable to name.

===Haddon Bay===
A bay lying immediately east of Mount Alexander along the south coast of Joinville Island. 
Discovered in January 1893 by Thomas Robertson, master of the ship Active, one of the Dundee whalers.
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953 and named by the UK-APC in 1956 for Professor Alfred C. Haddon (1855-1940), who helped Doctor W.S. Bruce with his preparations for scientific work with the Dundee whaling expedition.

===Mount Quilmes===
A mainly snow-covered mountain, , standing northeast of Haddon Bay. 
The name was given during the course of the Argentine Antarctic Expedition (1953-54) and memorializes the battle of the same&#x27;name in which the Argentine squadron of Admiral Guillermo Brown was engaged.

===Tay Head===
A rocky headland east of Mount Alexander, extending into the Firth of Tay on the south coast of Joinville Island. 
The name, given by the UK-APC in 1963, is derived from the Firth of Tay.

===Moody Point===
A point which forms the east end of Joinville Island. 
Discovered by a British expedition under Ross, 1839-43, and named by him for Lieutenant Governor Moody of the Falkland Islands.

===Williwaw Rocks===
Two small rocks lying south of Moody Point. 
Surveyed by the FIDS in 1953. 
The name arose because williwaws appear to be characteristic in the vicinity of Moody Point and the nearby Danger Islands.

===Scud Rock===
An isolated rock lying south of Moody Point. 
Roughly surveyed by the FIDS in 1953. 
So named by the UK-APC because scud (low, fast moving cloud) is characteristic of this area.

<text>Silesian-American Corporation (SACO) was registered as a corporation in Delaware in 1926 to assume ownership of the Giesche Spolka Akcyjna (Giesche) that was registered as a corporation in Katowice, Poland earlier during the interwar period. SACO gave substantial loans to Giesche’s Erben by selling $15,000,000 collateral trust sinking fund bonds that would mature on August 1, 1941. Giesche was that part of the holdings of the German corporation Bergwerksgesellschaft Georg von Giesche&#x27;s Erben (commonly referred to as Giesche’s Erben) that were in the previously German controlled Upper Silesia territory with the re-established Poland.

SACO was 100% owned by: the Silesian Holding Company (51% of common stock and 58,33% of preferred stock) and Giesche (49% of common stock and 41,67% of preferred stock). Silesian Holding Company was owned by Anaconda Copper Mining (65%) and W. Averell Harriman. Harriman&#x27;s portion would later be owned by Harriman, close affiliates and associates.

== WWII ==
Following invasion in 1939, Silesian-American was among the Polish corporations and companies that were brought under the supervision of a German military commissar, Dr. Albrecht Jung. During this time SACO was denied all income from the European Silesian-American activities and affiliates, and was hence unable to pay dividends on its outstanding bonds, which came due in 1941. At the time, the company had only about half a million dollars in cash. Accordingly, it filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter X of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.

== Repatriation scheme ==
Before entry to WWII by the U.S., the owners and leading managers of Giesche&#x27;s Erben sought, through a &quot;repatriation scheme&quot;, to regain legal control of Silesian-American through the leadership of Eduard Schulte, the Giesche’s Erben General Manager, and Jung. In 1941, the Swiss bank LaRoche acted jointly with Schulte to register another company in Switzerland, Internationale Kapitalanlegen Gesellschaft (Ikap). Schulte convinced Harriman and Cornelius Kelley (president of Anaconda Copper) to sell their shares in Silesian Holding Company to Ikap. However, the action could not be completed without coming under the scrutiny of the U.S. government owing to the Presidential freeze order, which was extended to Switzerland on June 14, 1941—the order mandated that transactions which potentially could benefit an enemy be subject to the review and approval of the United States Treasury Department. The first of three applications to transfer stock ownership from U.S. holders to enemy holders was refused by the Treasury Department on July 26, 1941; the other two were in August and December.

On November 17, 1942, the Alien Property Custodian as authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act, took over control of the German-owned shares of the Silesian-American Corporation. The stock, prior to August 31, 1939, stood in the stock book of Silesian in the name of Non Ferrum, Zurich, Switzerland, a Swiss corporation, which held the stock for the benefit of Bergwerksgesellschaft Georg von Giesche&#x27;s Erben, a German corporation. This action effectively put a stop to Schulte’s repatriation scheme.

== The post-war times ==
Before Silesian-American was finally dissolved, it took part in several legal proceedings in the 1950s.

<doc id="1130902" wikidata="Q423143" url="?curid=1130902" title="Sphingomyelin">
<text>Sphingomyelin (SPH, ) is a type of sphingolipid found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphocholine and ceramide, or a phosphoethanolamine head group; therefore, sphingomyelins can also be classified as sphingophospholipids. In humans, SPH represents ~85% of all sphingolipids, and typically makes up 10–20 mol % of plasma membrane lipids.

Sphingomyelin was first isolated by German chemist Johann L.W. Thudicum in the 1880s. The structure of sphingomyelin was first reported in 1927 as N-acyl-sphingosine-1-phosphorylcholine. Sphingomyelin content in mammals ranges from 2 to 15% in most tissues, with higher concentrations found in nerve tissues, red blood cells, and the ocular lenses. Sphingomyelin has significant structural and functional roles in the cell. It is a plasma membrane component and participates in many signaling pathways. The metabolism of sphingomyelin creates many products that play significant roles in the cell.

==Physical characteristics==

===Composition===
Sphingomyelin consists of a phosphocholine head group, a sphingosine, and a fatty acid. It is one of the few membrane phospholipids not synthesized from glycerol. The sphingosine and fatty acid can collectively be categorized as a ceramide. This composition allows sphingomyelin to play significant roles in signaling pathways: the degradation and synthesis of sphingomyelin produce important second messengers for signal transduction.

Sphingomyelin obtained from natural sources, such as eggs or bovine brain, contains fatty acids of various chain length. Sphingomyelin with set chain length, such as palmitoylsphingomyelin with a saturated 16 acyl chain, is available commercially.

===Properties===
Ideally, sphingomyelin molecules are shaped like a cylinder, however many molecules of sphingomyelin have a significant chain mismatch (the lengths of the two hydrophobic chains are significantly different). The hydrophobic chains of sphingomyelin tend to be much more saturated than other phospholipids. The main transition phase temperature of sphingomyelins is also higher compared to the phase transition temperature of similar phospholipids, near 37 °C. This can introduce lateral heterogeneity in the membrane, generating domains in the membrane bilayer.

Sphingomyelin undergoes significant interactions with cholesterol. Cholesterol has the ability to eliminate the liquid to solid phase transition in phospholipids. Due to sphingomyelin transition temperature being within physiological temperature ranges, cholesterol can play a significant role in the phase of sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin are also more prone to intermolecular hydrogen bonding than other phospholipids.

===Location===
Sphingomyelin is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it can be found in low amounts, and at the &quot;trans&quot; Golgi. It is enriched at the plasma membrane with a greater concentration on the outer than the inner leaflet. The Golgi complex represents an intermediate between the ER and plasma membrane, with slightly higher concentrations towards the trans side.

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of sphingomyelin involves the enzymatic transfer of a phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide. The first committed step of sphingomyelin synthesis involves the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. The product of this reaction is reduced, yielding dihydrosphingosine. The dihydrosphingosine undergoes N-acylation followed by desaturation to yield a ceramide. Each one of these reactions occurs at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The ceramide is transported to the Golgi apparatus where it can be converted to sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin synthase is responsible for the production of sphingomyelin from ceramide. Diacylglycerol is produced as a byproduct when the phosphocholine is transferred.
===Degradation===
Sphingomyelin breakdown is responsible for initiating many universal signaling pathways. It is hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinases (sphingomyelin specific type-C phospholipases). The phosphocholine head group is released into the aqueous environment while the ceramide diffuses through the membrane.

==Function==

===Membranes===
The membranous myelin sheath that surrounds and electrically insulates many nerve cell axons is particularly rich in sphingomyelin, suggesting its role as an insulator of nerve fibers. The plasma membrane of other cells is also abundant in sphingomyelin, though it is largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. There is, however, some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 – an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide – has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.

===Signal transduction===
The function of sphingomyelin remained unclear until it was found to have a role in signal transduction. It has been discovered that sphingomyelin plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways. The synthesis of sphingomyelin at the plasma membrane by sphingomyelin synthase 2 produces diacylglycerol, which is a lipid-soluble second messenger that can pass along a signal cascade. In addition, the degradation of sphingomyelin can produce ceramide which is involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway.

===Apoptosis===
Sphingomyelin has been found to have a role in cell apoptosis by hydrolyzing into ceramide. Studies in the late 1990s had found that ceramide was produced in a variety of conditions leading to apoptosis. It was then hypothesized that sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide signaling were essential in the decision of whether a cell dies. In the early 2000s new studies emerged that defined a new role for sphingomyelin hydrolysis in apoptosis, determining not only when a cell dies but how. After more experimentation it has been shown that if sphingomyelin hydrolysis happens at a sufficiently early point in the pathway the production of ceramide may influence either the rate and form of cell death or work to release blocks on downstream events.

===Lipid rafts===
Sphingomyelin, as well as other sphingolipids, are associated with lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are characterized by the lipid molecules being in the lipid ordered phase, offering more structure and rigidity compared to the rest of the plasma membrane. In the rafts, the acyl chains have low chain motion but the molecules have high lateral mobility. This order is in part due to the higher transition temperature of sphingolipids as well as the interactions of these lipids with cholesterol. Cholesterol is a relatively small, nonpolar molecule that can fill the space between the sphingolipids that is a result of the large acyl chains. Lipid rafts are thought to be involved in many cell processes, such as membrane sorting and trafficking, signal transduction, and cell polarization. Excessive sphingomyelin in lipid rafts may lead to insulin resistance.

Due to the specific types of lipids in these microdomains, lipid rafts can accumulate certain types of proteins associated with them, thereby increasing the special functions they possess. Lipid rafts have been speculated to be involved in the cascade of cell apoptosis.

==Abnormalities and associated diseases==
Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann–Pick disease, types A and B. It is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. Of the two types involving sphingomyelinase, type A occurs in infants. It is characterized by jaundice, an enlarged liver, and profound brain damage. Children with this type rarely live beyond 18 months. Type B involves an enlarged liver and spleen, which usually occurs in the pre-teen years. The brain is not affected. Most patients present with &lt;1% normal levels of the enzyme in comparison to normal levels. A hemolytic protein, lysenin, may be a valuable probe for sphingomyelin detection in cells of Niemann-Pick A patients.

As a result of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS), the myelin sheath of neuronal cells in the brain and spinal cord is degraded, resulting in loss of signal transduction capability. MS patients exhibit upregulation of certain cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid, particularly tumor necrosis factor alpha. This activates sphingomyelinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide; sphingomyelinase activity has been observed in conjunction with cellular apoptosis.

An excess of sphingomyelin in the red blood cell membrane (as in abetalipoproteinemia) causes excess lipid accumulation in the outer leaflet of the red blood cell plasma membrane. This results in abnormally shaped red cells called acanthocytes.

<text>Hybrid library is a term used by librarians to describe libraries containing a mix of traditional print library resources and the growing number of electronic resources.

==Overview==
Hybrid libraries are mixes of traditional print material such as books and magazines, as well as electronic based material such as downloadable audiobooks, electronic journals, e-books, etc. Hybrid libraries are the new norm in most public and academic libraries.

It seems that the term &quot;hybrid library&quot; was first coined in 1998 by Chris Rusbridge in an article for &quot;D-Lib Magazine&quot;.

Hybrid libraries evolved in the 1990s when electronic resources became more easily available for libraries to acquire for public use. Initially these electronic resources were typically access to material distributed on media such as CD-ROM or searches of specialised databases. OCLC helped push libraries towards acquiring digital resources by providing a centralized technology resource for participating libraries. Now, with the widespread availability of digital content, it includes Internet resources and documents which are online, such as eprints.

The libraries own and subscribe to different resources in different formats. Some of the common formats are ejournals, serials, print monographs, CD and DVD. The main components of digital library framework are user interfaces, repository, handle system, and search system. The handle system and search system are the major components that should be designed with interoperability features to search across different repositories owned by different vendors. The user interface should be designed in a generic way that it helps library patrons develop a common knowledge to do advanced searches across all repositories.

Hybrid libraries are the new norm for many archivists as well. Digitization has changed the way archivists have gone about preserving historical items. Archivists are now using digital technology to preserve items that were once only preserved by things like microfiche. Archivists now use things like digital imaging which make it possible for researchers to see historical items online.

The emergence of the hybrid library has put a new emphasis on copyright issues for many libraries. The complicated and changing copyright laws in both the United States and the European Union have made it a challenge for many libraries to make sure their patrons are using the digital items lawfully.

Hybrid libraries need staff that are trained in helping patrons navigate the vast amount of information available in the digital age. Librarians working in hybrid libraries have training in electronic media as well as the traditional print forms.

==Issues in hybrid library==

Some of the issues facing the hybrid libraries are the digital divide, interoperability, collection development, ownership of electronic resources and preservation of digital media.

Any advancement in information technology will be useful only when you know how to use it. The term digital divide is used to describe the gap between those with information technology knowledge and those who do not.

===Collection development===

Collection development is another challenge facing the hybrid libraries. The process of collection management in a hybrid library is similar to that of a traditional library. Hybrid libraries follow the same policies and procedures followed in traditional library collection development.

===Ownership of electronic resources===

Ownership of electronic resources is another issue facing the hybrid libraries. Ownership of electronic materials is virtual and not physical. There are no clear policies about the ownership of electronic materials once the subscription is cancelled or expired. Libraries have to pay attention to the legal contracts from the database vendors. If the libraries plan on archiving the electronic resources, then there are legal issues related to it. The most prominent legal issues are intellectual property and authenticity of digital information.

===Preservation of digital media===

With any new advanced technology related to digital information storage, the main question to be answered is its durability. Digital storage media like disc or tapes deteriorate over time. The main question related to digital preservation is what and how much should be preserved. To make the preservation of digital media cost effective, standardization of different media format is required. Following are the three possible approaches.

===Technology preservation, emulation, and migration===

In technology preservation, both hardware and software related to digital information are preserved. This may not be cost effective because changes to hardware and different versions of software need to be either maintained or constantly upgraded.

In emulation, some emulator software programs will mimic the hardware and software of the original data and display in the original format.

In migration, digital information is converted to a standard media with standard format.

<text>Gloria Monty (August 12, 1921 – March 30, 2006) was an American television producer working primarily in the field of daytime drama.

==Education==
Born Gloria Montemuro in Allenhurst, New Jersey and raised in the West Allenhurst neighborhood of Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey, she attended the University of Iowa, New York University, and Columbia University, where she earned her master&#x27;s degree in drama.

==Theatre work==
In 1952, she married writer and editor Robert O&#x27;Byrne, with whom she had founded a New York theater group, Abbe Theater School. With O&#x27;Byrne, Monty directed summer stock productions and led acting and speech workshops at The New School in New York City, where her pupils included Marlon Brando, Demi Moore and Tony Curtis.

==TV career==
After directing shows such as &quot;The First Hundred Years&quot;, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; (for many years), and &quot;Bright Promise&quot;, she is best known for taking over the ailing ABC Daytime serial &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1978 as Executive Producer. Fred Silverman, the head of ABC, gave Monty thirteen weeks to turn the show around, with cancellation threatened if she did not succeed. It subsequently became the top-rated American daytime drama and won several Daytime Emmy Awards.

To accomplish this turnaround, she increased the show&#x27;s pace, and focused main storylines on younger characters to reach out to younger viewers, particularly the pairing of ingenue Laura Spencer (Genie Francis) and troubled criminal Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary, whom she knew from his stint on her previous series, &quot;Bright Promise&quot;). She gave the sets a more contemporary look and feel, and employed production techniques once used only in primetime. One major result of the &quot;Monty Revolution&quot; was the faster pace of the show, effectively doubling the number of scenes in each episode. She was known for her rigid work ethic and for being tough with the cast and crew. “She demand[ed] excellence, but she reward[ed] it,” said coordinating producer Jerry Balme.

Monty was accused of perpetuating dangerous misconceptions about rape, implicitly exalting violence against women. But Monty viewed the “rape” as a choreographed &quot;seduction.” Under her tenure, &quot;General Hospital&quot; rose to the top spot in the ratings, with Luke and Laura&#x27;s 1981 wedding being the highest rated episode in daytime history (about 30 million viewers in 13 million households). Monty&#x27;s Revolution consisted of couples such as Luke/Laura, Frisco/Felicia, and Robert/Holly. She and various head writers also created the Quartermaine family, Bobbie Spencer, Luke Spencer, Lucy Coe, Robert Scorpio, Anna Devane, Robin Scorpio, the Cassadine family, and many other popular characters who would dominate the show in the 1980s and early 1990s.

&quot;General Hospital&quot; received cover stories in both &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which referred to Luke and Laura as the “Rhett Butler and Scarlett O&#x27;Hara of Soapland”. Included in the show&#x27;s fan base were celebrities Elizabeth Taylor and Sammy Davis Jr., both of whom guest starred on the series. She was also the executive producer of the primetime serial &quot;The Hamptons&quot;. She employed many former daytime performers for this show. The serial was unusual because it was videotaped rather than being filmed. Monty announced her departure from &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1986, working on her final episode as executive producer in January 1987. Her next two successors, H. Wesley Kenney (1987–1989) and Joseph Hardy (1989–1991), were both lauded by viewers, but &quot;GH&quot; fell out of first place in 1988 (with the ratings top spot being taken over by &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, the show that Kenney was hired from). By 1990, the show&#x27;s ratings were starting to sag significantly. That December, ABC&#x27;s daytime programming head Jackie Smith successfully hired Monty back as &quot;GH&quot; executive producer, and Monty resumed her role on February 13, 1991.

In early 1991, Monty lured Anthony Geary back to daytime, but not as the popular Luke Spencer. Instead, Monty went along with Geary&#x27;s demand to play a brand new character, Bill Eckert, Luke&#x27;s lookalike cousin. An entire new family, the blue-collar Eckerts, was ushered in, and quickly dominated storyline, while the longrunning Quartermaine family was phased out. Monty also fired a dozen actors, in what the press described as a &quot;bloodbath&quot;, including actress Jennifer Guthrie, who played heroine Dawn Winthrop. After Monty appointed her sister, Norma Monty, as head writer, the ratings eroded further.

Monty&#x27;s dismissal became inevitable between the declining ratings and the departure of popular cast members such as Tristan Rogers (Robert Scorpio) and Finola Hughes (Anna Devane, who Monty fired among much criticism). In early 1992, after only a year, Monty was replaced with Wendy Riche. She produced several made-for-television movies based on her friend Mary Higgins Clark&#x27;s novels. She also chaired the New Jersey Motion Picture &amp; Television Commission.

==Honors==
In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Monty.

==Death==
She and her sister moved to Rumson, New Jersey, in 1994. Monty died on March 30, 2006, at Rancho Mirage, California, from cancer, aged 84. She was buried at Saint Catharine&#x27;s Cemetery, Sea Girt, New Jersey.

<text>is a Shingon sect Buddhist temple located outside of Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is more popularly known as the , after its primary object of worship.

It is the 6th temple in the Bandō Sanjūsankasho pilgrimage circuit of 33 Buddhist temples in the Kantō region of eastern Japan to the goddess Kannon.

==History==
According to temple legend, Chōkoku-ji was founded by either the wandering holy ascetic Gyōki around 725 AD, or the famed prelate Kūkai from 810-835 AD. However, no historical documents have survived to substantiate this legend, and the history of the temple is thus uncertain. During the Kamakura period, the temple was a center for ecumenical studies linking the Shingon sect with the Tendai, Ritsu and Zen sects, along with Kakuon-ji in Kamakura and Shōmyo-ji in Mutsuura. At present, the temple belongs to the Kōyasan Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism.

The temple&#x27;s Main Hall dates from the Edo period and houses the &quot;honzon&quot; bronze Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu. The temple is also noted for its &quot;sakura&quot; in spring.</text><links>

<text>Sphingosine (2-amino-4-trans-octadecene-1,3-diol) is an 18-carbon amino alcohol with an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, which forms a primary part of sphingolipids, a class of cell membrane lipids that include sphingomyelin, an important phospholipid.

==Functions==
Sphingosine can be phosphorylated in vivo via two kinases, sphingosine kinase type 1 and sphingosine kinase type 2. This leads to the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a potent signaling lipid.

Sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, are lipid signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular processes.

== Biosynthesis ==
Sphingosine is synthesized from palmitoyl CoA and serine in a condensation required to yield dihydrosphingosine.

Dehydrosphingosine is then reduced by NADPH to dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine), acylated to dihydroceramide and finally oxidized by FAD to ceramide. Sphingosine is then solely formed via degradation of sphingolipid in the lysosome.

<doc id="1130917" wikidata="Q649833" url="?curid=1130917" title="Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal">
<text>had many names, each depending on the period of its existence, and the circumstances at that time. Many of the names were acronyms that were derived from its military name or designation, which changed from time to time. The arsenal was sometimes known as &quot;Kūgi-shō&quot; (空技廠, a contraction of &quot;Kōkū Gijutsu-shō&quot; 航空技術廠). The name Yokosuka prevailed however, even though it referred to the Arsenal&#x27;s location at Yokosuka, Japan.

==History==
The air arsenal&#x27;s roots go back to 1869 when the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established a naval arsenal at Yokosuka, about 13 miles south of Yokohama on Tokyo Bay. The arsenal provided ship building, repair and replenishment to the Japanese Navy. It was also a storage depot where munitions and other assorted supplies were brought as they were purchased.

When a number of foreign aircraft were purchased for evaluation, the Navy brought them to the arsenal for processing. The arsenal assembled the aircraft from their shipping boxes, and when assembled, they were flown by the pilots who had been sent abroad for flying lessons and evaluate the aircraft flown.

Modifications to these aircraft were done as weaknesses were found, or when an improvement was incorporated. To facilitate this work, the IJN established the Aeroplane Factory, Ordnance Department at the arsenal&#x27;s torpedo factory in May 1913.

The next year, the first acronym was used was Yokosho, a contraction of . The arsenal was renamed in December 1919. The name was assigned by April, 1923, when the arsenal was moved to Tsukiji with several other Naval support units. The entire Tsukiji facility was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Several names were used when the navy began establishment of the arsenal. Research was started again in 1924 when several aircraft were evaluated. Under the command of the newly formed Naval Air Headquarters, the was formed at Yokosuka on 1 April 1932. A large amount of draftsmen and Designers were transferred from the Hiro Naval Arsenal, ending aircraft production there.

==The war years==
During World War II, the arsenal was responsible for the design of several IJN aircraft, although the arsenal itself did not manufacture more than a few prototypes of the aircraft it designed. Its designs were mass-produced by companies such as Aichi Kokuki, Watanabe Tekkōjo steel foundry, (renamed in 1943 to ), and the . Aircraft designed by the arsenal are usually designated by the manufacturer&#x27;s letter &quot;Y&quot; for &quot;Yokosuka&quot;.

An example of the above is the Yokosuka D4Y1 which was mainly produced by Aichi. The D4Y1 and later models were also produced by the at Hiro.

<text>Graham Land is the portion of the Antarctic Peninsula that lies north of a line joining Cape Jeremy and Cape Agassiz. This description of Graham Land is consistent with the 1964 agreement between the British Antarctic Place-names Committee and the US Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names, in which the name &quot;Antarctic Peninsula&quot; was approved for the major peninsula of Antarctica, and the names Graham Land and Palmer Land for the northern and southern portions, respectively. The line dividing them is roughly 69 degrees south.

Graham Land is named after Sir James R. G. Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty at the time of John Biscoe&#x27;s exploration of the west side of Graham Land in 1832. It is claimed by Argentina (as part of Argentine Antarctica), Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory) and Chile (as part of the Chilean Antarctic Territory).

Graham Land is the closest part of Antarctica to South America. Thus it is the usual destination for small ships taking paying visitors on Antarctic trips from South America. (Larger ships are not allowed to disembark passengers.)

Until the discoveries of the British Graham Land Expedition of 1934–1937, it was generally supposed to be an archipelago rather than a peninsula. The mountains of Graham Land are the last range of the American Cordillera, the almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges forming the western &quot;backbone&quot; of North America, Central America, South America and the Antarctic Peninsula.

Argentina calls the area &quot;Tierra de San Martín&quot; (Land of San Martin) and also calls the northern peninsula (Trinity Peninsula) &quot;Península Trinidad&quot; or &quot;Tierra de la Trinidad&quot;. Similarly, Chile calls the entire Antarctic Peninsula &quot;Tierra de O&#x27;Higgins&quot; (Land of O&#x27;Higgins).

==Features==
===Peaks===
* Mount Brading, east of the northeast corner of Larsen Inlet.
* The Downfall, located between the heads of Arago Glacier and Woodbury Glacier.

===Plateaus===
The interior of Graham Land is occupied by a series of plateaus, namely (north to south) Laclavère Plateau, Louis Philippe Plateau, Detroit Plateau, Herbert Plateau, Foster Plateau, Forbidden Plateau, Bruce Plateau, Avery Plateau and Hemimont Plateau.

<text>Palmer Land () is the portion of the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica that lies south of a line joining Cape Jeremy and Cape Agassiz. This application of Palmer Land is consistent with the 1964 agreement between the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names and the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee, in which the name Antarctic Peninsula was approved for the major peninsula of Antarctica, and the names Graham Land and Palmer Land for the northern and southern portions, respectively. The line dividing them is roughly 69° S.
==Boundaries==
In its southern extreme, the Antarctic Peninsula stretches west, with Palmer Land eventually bordering Ellsworth Land along the 80° W line of longitude. Palmer Land is bounded in the south by the ice-covered Carlson Inlet, an arm of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, which crosses the 80° W line. This is the base of Cetus Hill.

This feature is named after Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer who explored the Antarctic Peninsula area southward of Deception Island in the sloop &quot;Hero&quot; in November 1820.

<doc id="1130941" wikidata="Q27075027" url="?curid=1130941" title="Golden-shouldered parrot">
<text>The golden-shouldered parrot (Psephotellus chrysopterygius), also known as the alwal, arrmorral, minpin, thaku and antbed parrot, is a rare bird of southern Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. A small parrot related to the more common hooded parrot (&quot;P. dissimilis&quot;) of the Northern Territory and the extinct paradise parrot of Queensland and New South Wales.

It is classified as Endangered due mostly to an increase in mid-story vegetation, which increases predation. A major conservation project is underway on Artemis Station to save the species from extinction. This was also the location for filming BBC&#x27;s Planet Earth 3. 

==Taxonomy==
The golden-shouldered parrot was formally described in 1858 by the English ornithologist John Gould from specimens collected by Joseph Elsey in northern Queensland while on an expedition led by Augustus Gregory. Gould placed the species in the genus &quot;Psephotus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psephotus chrysopterygius&quot;. The golden-shouldered parrot is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Psephotellus&quot; that was introduced in 1913 by the ornithologist Gregory Mathews. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is a diminutive of &quot;Psephotus&quot; which is from the Ancient Greek &quot;psēphōtos&quot; meaning &quot;inlaid with mosaic stones or jewels&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;chrysopterygius&quot; combines the Greek &quot;khrusos&quot; meaning &quot;gold&quot; with &quot;pterux&quot;, &quot;pterugos&quot; meaning &quot;wing&quot;.

This parrot is most closely related to the extinct paradise parrot (&quot;Psephotellus pulcherrimus&quot;) and the two together are sister to the hooded parrot &quot;Psephotellus dissimilis&quot;.

==Description==
The golden-shouldered parrot is 23–28 cm long and weighs 54–56 g. The adult male is mainly blue and has a characteristic yellow over the shoulder area. It has a black cap and pale yellow frontal band. It has an extended dark salmon pink lower belly, thighs and undertail-coverts. It has a grey-brown lower back.

Adult females are mainly dull greenish-yellow, and have a broad cream bar on the underside of the wings. The head in older females has a charcoal grey cap. The feathers of the vent area are a pale salmon pink. Juveniles are similar to the adult female though newly fledged males have a brighter blue cheek patch than females of the same age.

==Habitat==
The golden-shouldered parrot lives in open forested grassland liberally populated by numerous termite species and their mounds. Often these mounds are found every few metres apart. The parrot feeds on the seeds of small grass species and several months of the year, principally those prior to the onset of the wet season, the birds are almost entirely dependent on the small but plentiful seed of firegrass (&quot;Schizachyrium fragile&quot;). An important habitat requirement is the presence of suitably sized terrestrial termite mounds, in which the birds nest. This has led to the golden shouldered parrot and its relatives being known as the antbed parrots.

==Breeding==
The golden-shouldered parrot will build a nest in the taller magnetic termite mounds (up to 2 m high) but surveys point to the preference for the lower dome type mounds. This may be to do with the slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds. Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 –350 mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3–6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of air conditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot&#x27;s nest chamber at around 28–30 °C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13–35 °C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the golden shouldered parrot and the moth species &quot;Trisyntopa scatophaga&quot;, the antbed parrot moth. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae.

There appears to be a tendency for more male parrots relative to females to be born. This may be to counter the increased predation that males appear to suffer in the wild.

==Status==
The golden-shouldered parrot is listed as endangered (CITES I), with population surveys pointing to a total wild population of between 700-1,100 birds with around 300 breeding pairs. The remaining majority of birds are thought to be juvenile birds in their first year of life.

The species has a restricted range and suffers from a variety of threats, including changes to habitat structure, excessive predation and loss of feeding habitat. The main threat relates to changes to burning regimes and grazing pressure in the birds&#x27; grasslands and sparse open woodlands. Grazing pressure (by cattle and agile wallabies) and damage by feral pigs reduces important food plants, like cockatoo grass. The interaction between changed fire patterns and grazing pressure has also led to a phenomenon called &quot;woody thickening&quot;, whereby native trees and shrubs outcompete the grasses. Over time, this process results in the loss of grasslands and spare open woodlands, as they become dominated by higher tree densities. The extra cover that is created by this process allow the parrot predators, such as the pied butcherbird (&quot;Cracticus nigrogularis&quot;), to hunt more successfully. A number of cases have been noted where parrots raise nestlings on their own without a partner, or juveniles taking over the role of adults (that presumably have been killed). In captivity it is noted that golden-shouldered parrots will readily accept a new partner and this may be related to this wild breeding behaviour. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for golden-shouldered parrot conservation are Morehead River and Staaten River. 

Much of the current understanding about Golden-shouldered Parrots comes from Artemis Station. In 2019, the owners of Artemis - the Shephard family - started a collaboration with ecologist Steve Murphy, based at the University of Queensland. Together, Murphy and the Shephards started &quot;Artemis Nature Fund&quot; to enable practical conservation actions to take place on the property. The main actions revolve around resetting the landscape to a more open vegetation structure. Many places on Artemis have undergone severe woody thickening over the past few decades. The work on Artemis centres upon resetting the ecosystem back to a more open state, which should relieve predation pressure. Between July 2021 and December 2022, approximately 60 hectares of breeding habitat had been restored by clearing. Temporary removal of cattle and reinstating former burning practices are also being used to manage habitats. Research is showing that predators are less likely to use areas once they are restored to an open structure. On-going monitoring of the parrots using colour-banding is yet to demonstrate an increase in numbers, however, monitoring during the 2022 breeding season suggested that nests were more likely to be successful if they had received management attention, in the form of clearing. Supplementary feeding has been occurring on Artemis since the early 2000s. This is designed to help birds through periods of natural food shortage, which is exacerbated by grazing pressure. It also gives birds a safer place to feed and provides researchers to monitor the survival of colour-banded birds.

The Golden shouldered parrot is scarce in captivity. A population of perhaps 1,000 birds in Australia and perhaps 300 held in overseas aviaries means a limited gene pool is available. A dedicated group of breeders in Australia have attempted to promote the species and ensure that a viable breeding population is maintained in captivity. Many international breeders are also working toward this same goal.

The provision of heated nest boxes for breeding birds and the replication of a wild type diet is being used to try and formulate a successful regime leading to more predictable breeding results. Aviary birds can tend to become too fat if fed too rich a diet, resulting in infertility issues. The tendency to aggression between pairs means the keeping of one pair to an aviary and solid partitions between aviaries is essential to prevent injuries. The provision of earth floors in aviaries is considered best practice. Suspended flights do not allow for the parrots need to dig and feed on the ground as they do in the wild.

==Plot==

In the year 300X, the entire world is under the tyrannical rule of a regime called the Maruhage Empire (Chrome Dome Empire in the English translation of both the manga and anime). Its ruler, Emperor Tsuru Tsurulina IV (Czar Baldy Bald IV), has initiated the Hair Hunt, a crusade where his army, the Hair Hunters, invade settlements, shave bald every person they see, and leave said settlements in ruins. Standing against the Hair Hunt is Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, a bizarre, but powerful rebel who fights the Hair Hunters with the Hanage Shinken (Super Fist of the Nose Hair), a martial art that gives him the power to control his nose hairs like whips. Bo-bobo&#x27;s group consists of Beauty, a teenage girl he rescued; Heppokomaru (Gasser), a teenage boy who fights with the Onara Shinken (Super Fist of the Back Wind), allowing him to weaponize his own flatulence; and Don Patch (Poppa Rocks), an eccentric creature who leads the Hajike Gang (Wiggin Gang), a group that fights by confusing their enemies into submission. Bo-bobo is on an exciting, gag-filled quest in which he ventures from locale to locale, fighting the forces of the Maruhage Empire and gaining more allies along the way.

===Manga===

&quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot;, written and illustrated by Yoshio Sawai, was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from February 20, 2001, to November 14, 2005. Shueisha collected its 230 individual chapters into 21 volumes, released from July 4, 2001, to May 2, 2006.

A sequel manga titled was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from December 19, 2005, to July 2, 2007. Shueisha compiled the sequel&#x27;s 73 individual chapters into seven volumes released from July 4, 2006, to January 1, 2008.

In North America, the manga has been licensed by Viz Media and was published in a one-shot graphic novel form on October 5, 2005, including content from the ninth and tenth volumes of the Japanese release. It was later published monthly in &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; from July 2007 to June 2009. At Anime Expo 2008, when asked about why certain volumes were never published, Viz Media said it was for content reasons. Viz Media restarted the manga release in 2008. The first volume (eleventh volume of the Japanese release) was published on August 5, 2008. A total of five volumes of &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot; were published until October 5, 2010, before Viz Media ceased the series&#x27; publication.

A spin-off, titled , started in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Saikyō Jump&quot; on December 3, 2011. Shueisha released three volumes from November 2, 2012, to June 4, 2014. A second part, titled , was published on &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; from October 3, 2014, to August 3, 2015. A single volume was released on August 4, 2015.

===Anime===

The anime adaptation of &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot; is directed by Hiroki Shibata, produced by Toei Animation and ran for 76 episodes from November 8, 2003, to October 29, 2005, on TV Asahi. The first opening theme for episodes 1 to 32 is &quot;Wild Challenger&quot; by Jindou, and the second opening theme for episode 33 onwards is by Ulfuls. The first ending theme for episodes 1 to 19 is by Mani Laba, the second ending theme for episodes 20 to 32 is by Freenote, and the third ending theme for episode 33 onwards is &quot;H.P.S.J.&quot; by Mihimaru GT.

In North America, the anime was licensed by the Joy Tashjian Marketing Group, a licensing representative named by Toei Animation. A was shown on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Summer 2005 Kick-Off Special&quot; in May 2005, and then premiered on the network&#x27;s Toonami programming block on September 30 of that same year.

The series was originally licensed for home video release in North America by Illumitoon Entertainment in 2006, who released only two volumes on bilingual DVD in 2007, before their distribution deal with Westlake Entertainment fell through, and all further volumes were canceled. S&#x27;more Entertainment later announced on January 16, 2012, that they would release the series with English subtitles and dubbing on DVD on April 10 of the same year. This release, however, lacked an English subtitle track, despite a fully translated script being present on a PDF file on the fourth disc, indication on the box, and pre-release information that there would be a subtitle track on the release. S&#x27;more Entertainment released a statement claiming the packaging was wrong, and there never was an intention to subtitle the release, due to costs. In August 2018, Discotek Media announced that it had licensed the series, which was released on January 28, 2020, as a SD Blu-ray Disc set with all the 76 episodes.

===Stage play===
A stage play adaptation was announced on April 1, 2024. It was initially announced as an April Fools&#x27; Day joke at midnight, but was later confirmed to be real. The stage play, titled , is directed and written by Keita Kawajiri and is set to run at Theatre1010 in Tokyo from October 23–31, 2024.

<doc id="1130950" wikidata="Q1753419" url="?curid=1130950" title="Balance (Van Halen album)">
<text>Balance is the tenth studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on January 24, 1995, by Warner Bros. Records. The album is the last of the band&#x27;s four studio releases to feature Sammy Hagar as the lead singer. It is also the final Van Halen album to feature bassist Michael Anthony in its entirety. &quot;Balance&quot; reached number 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in February 1995 and reached triple platinum status on May 12, 2004, by selling more than three million copies in the US. &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.

Featuring a more serious tone than other Van Halen albums, &quot;Balance&quot; features a full integration of Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s guitar riffs and keyboard work and contains three instrumentals. The record received mixed reviews from many music critics.

The album was remastered by Donn Landee and released on October 6, 2023, as part of &quot;The Collection II&quot;; the four studio albums with Hagar, plus an extra disc of eight rarities from this era.

==Recording and production==
According to Ian Christe&#x27;s book, &quot;Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga&quot;, &quot;Balance&quot; was released amid internal fighting between Hagar and the Van Halen brothers. The band worked eight-hour days for three months recording the album. The first song on the record, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, features mystical overtones that came, in part, from Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s newfound sobriety. His therapist, Sat-Kaur Khalsa, urged him to relax and imagine where he was after drinking a six-pack of beer. After smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, and playing guitar for 20 years, he tried writing songs sober and wrote three songs in one half hour period. The album then moves into Hagar&#x27;s territory with &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. The song was taken from his ex-wife&#x27;s point of view, believing that she was still in love with him. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their fourth consecutive number one studio album.

Most of the &quot;Balance&quot; album was recorded at Eddie&#x27;s 5150 Studios, located in Studio City, except for five lead vocal tracks that were recorded in Vancouver, where the album&#x27;s producer Bruce Fairbairn resided. It was mixed by Mike Fraser and mastered at Sterling Sound, New York, by George Marino.

Following the recording of &quot;Balance&quot; and its subsequent &quot;Ambulance Tour&quot; (the band renaming the tour as Eddie was having hip issues and brother Alex had to wear a neck brace), Van Halen&#x27;s second incarnation broke up. Regarding this time period, in 1996 Eddie Van Halen told &quot;Guitar World&quot;: &quot;There had been a variety of conflicts brewing between manager Ray Danniels, Sammy, and the band since I quit drinking on October 2, 1994... It got so bad that I actually started drinking again.&quot;

===Songs===

&quot;Balance&quot; has a more serious direction than earlier Van Halen albums; as reviewer Johnny Cigarettes described the direction: &quot;Monks are chanting. Sleevenotes are in medieval script. The cover is Athena&#x27;s mystical arse. Van Halen have decided to get serious on us.&quot; Critic Howard Cohen wrote that, in contrast to the flashy minimalist sound of Van Halen&#x27;s earliest records, &quot;Balance&quot; features &quot;grand production: big drums, ambient keyboard textures and other sonic frills.&quot;

&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; kicks off the album. Complete with chanting monks and dangling metal bells, the song unveiled a vast, open, U2-like guitar wall that propelled through the darkest terrain the band ever tackled. Eddie revealed in 2012 that &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was written before Van Halen became a band. In an August 1995 interview with &quot;Total Guitar&quot;, Eddie took credit for &quot;[doing] these weird monk sounds at the very top of the record&quot;, though they have also been credited to monks from Gyuto Tantric University in Tibet. One reviewer noted the song&#x27;s &quot;decidedly Zeppish salvo of psuedo-mysticism&quot; and described the Gyoto monks as a sample, while &quot;Vulture&quot;″s Chuck Klosterman compares it a &quot;mid-period Yes album&quot;.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot; is a ballad that has been compared to the style of &quot;5150&quot; (1986), with an especially 1980s-style melody; its guitar tone has been compared to Tom Petty but with &quot;strategically&quot; deployed riffs. On &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot;, Hagar exhibits a social conscience similar to that of &quot;Right Now&quot; (1991), and meditates on the suicide of Kurt Cobain. Its guitar solo is atypical and has drawn comparison to Neil Young. &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; features changes in rhythm and fretboard textures, while &quot;Not Enough&quot; is a ballad written around a Ben Folds-esque piano part.

&quot;Amsterdam&quot; was written about Eddie and Alex&#x27;s birthplace. Eddie told &quot;Guitar World&quot;: &quot;I always hated the words to &#x27;Wham, Bam Amsterdam&#x27;, from &quot;Balance&quot;, because they were all about smoking pot. They were just stupid. Lyrics should plant some sort of seed for thought, or at least be a little more metamorphical.&quot; This is another song based on an idea that predates the album&#x27;s sessions as there is video of Eddie playing the riff to &quot;Amsterdam&quot; at 5150 Studios in 1987.

&quot;Balance&quot; also features three instrumentals. &quot;Strung Out&quot;, an avant-gade experiment described by &quot;Guitar World&quot; as a &quot;strange piano piece&quot;, was reportedly recorded by Eddie in the early 1980s, having rented pianist Marvin Hamlisch&#x27;s beach house for a summer vacation. The guitar explained: &quot;I just used to waste this beautiful piano. It was like a Baldwin or a Yamaha. It had cigarette burns all over it and I was sticking everything but the kitchen sink in it: ping-pong balls, D-cell batteries, knives, forks – I even broke a few strings. I don&#x27;t know what prompted me to do it. I was just fucking around. Actually, it started off with me playing the strings with my fingers. I would create harmonics by hitting the key and muffling the string up and down to bring harmonics out like on a guitar.&quot; According to Eddie, Fairbarn &quot;loved it&quot; and selected it for inclusion on &quot;Balance&quot; from the numerous tapes of these experiments that Eddie owned. &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot; has been described as a drum solo, though Eddie disagreed and called it &quot;a little intro&quot; for the next song. Klosterman compares it to the material on side two of Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vitalogy&quot; (1994), while music critic Johnny Cigarettes describes &quot;Strung Out&quot; and &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot;, respectively, as &quot;roughly approximating a carpenter next door and a toddler banging pots and pans.&quot;

&quot;Baluchitherium&quot; has been compared to Jeff Beck. According to Eddie: &quot;It didn&#x27;t start out being an instrumental track, it&#x27;s just nobody kinda liked where we were going with it. So we just left the vocal off – and just like basically any Van Halen song, you take the vocals off and the music still holds up. And here&#x27;s the proof because this one held up. And we thought, &quot;Oh fuck it, let&#x27;s put it out like that.&quot; It&#x27;s like what we were doing with the singing, with the vocal, it just didn&#x27;t add shit to it so we left it right off.&quot; The final minute of the song features a programmed rhythm.

During the &quot;Balance Tour&quot; show in Pensacola, Florida, Hagar stated that &quot;Take Me Back (Déjà Vu)&quot; was &quot;a true story&quot;. The song itself features a then almost 20-year-old riff Eddie had previously used on a song entitled &quot;No More Waiting&quot;, which the band played on occasion in the pre-&quot;Van Halen I&quot; era, making it the third known song on the album based on an older idea. Klosterman notes the heavy use of wind chimes in the song, and compares Hagar&#x27;s singing to Natalie Maines.

==Artwork==
The original title of the album was &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, for which photographer Glen Wexler created some concepts, including one with an androgynous four-year-old boy. Eventually they picked &quot;Balance&quot;, which Alex explained to Wexler was about the turmoil and changes surrounding Van Halen, including the recent death of long-time manager Ed Leffler. Alex asked for something &quot;exploring the duality of the human psyche&quot;; Wexler then sketched some new concepts, with the band liking the one with conjoined twins on a see-saw. The androgynous boy, who actually hailed from Denver but fans mistakenly considered to be Eddie&#x27;s son Wolfgang Van Halen, was then photographed in Wexler&#x27;s Hollywood studio, with Wexler&#x27;s daughter being the hand model that pulled his hair. The images were combined with a miniature landscape for the background using Fractal Design Painter (now called Corel Painter). Wexler detailed that the &quot;Balance&quot; cover had a number of ironies: &quot;the impossibility of the conjoined twins actually playing on the seesaw; the &#x27;calm&#x27; twin actually being the aggressive one, pulling the hair of his sibling to create the appearance of an aggressive child; and having no one else to play with in a desolate post-apocalyptic setting, in which unusable playground equipment is the only object in sight.&quot; He added that the twins were “designed” to mimic the shape of the “VH” logo. An alternate cover was used for the Japanese release, citing a cultural offense to the original version. On the inside, the compact disc shows the Leonardo da Vinci drawing &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, and the back of the booklet shows an egg balanced upright on a guitar.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Balance&quot; was released January 24, 1995, and is the first release by a platinum-certified act on Warner Bros. since Danny Goldberg stepped in as chairman/CEO. It is also the band&#x27;s first album since the loss of their longtime manager Ed Leffler, who died of thyroid cancer on October 16, 1993, before Ray Danniels took over management of the band (mostly due to Alex&#x27;s personal relationship with Danniels as brother-in-law). Warner Bros. VP of merchandising and advertising Jim Wagner said that early 1995 would be the right time to release a new Van Halen album, as &quot;It seems like we&#x27;ve always had success with big acts right after the first of the year&quot;. (Van Halen&#x27;s own &quot;1984&quot; was released in early January 1984.) &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot;, the first single from &quot;Balance&quot;, was released to top 40 and album rock radio on December 28, 1994. Van Halen became the first act to debut at No. 1 in 1995, as their first week sales of 295,000 units earned &quot;Balance&quot; the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The opening-week tally for Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Balance&quot; was 21% higher than that of &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;, the band&#x27;s previous studio album, which topped the chart with 243,000 units in the summer of 1991.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Balance&quot; reached number 8 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming their first British Top 10 placing; Martin C. Strong believes its UK sales were helped by the rare European tour undertaken by the group. In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, author Colin Larkin commented how &quot;Balance&quot; reconfirmed how the band&#x27;s popularity was &quot;seemingly impervious to the ravages of time or fashion.&quot;

Two concerts during the &quot;Balance&quot; tour were filmed and aired as a pay-per-view event at the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on August 18 and 19. There was talk of releasing a live DVD of the performances, which found the band to be at their peak during the tour. While the release of the DVD never materialized, most of the source material can be viewed on YouTube.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Balance&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Paul Evans commented on the album&#x27;s &quot;surprises&quot;, saying: &quot;While Eddie&#x27;s new look, a goatee and chopped pompadour, may seem a nod to the plaid-clad ranks, there&#x27;s nothing alternative about &quot;Balance&quot;. Nor, despite the Buddhist chanting that kicks off the disc, is there anything otherwise chic.&quot; Evans noted that Eddie dominates the album with majestic riffs, but further praised the other musicians, including highlighting Alex&#x27;s &quot;thunder-bucket snare&quot; as the group&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon&quot;, and approving of Hagar&#x27;s role as &quot;a sort of Everyman as a rock star, a true &quot;vox populi&quot;.&quot; &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; critic Joe Selvin wrote that Fairbairn&#x27;s production had not changed Van Halen&#x27;s sound and comments that, although subtleties are rare in the band&#x27;s work, touches of keyboards and acoustic guitar are present in the back of the mix. The reviewer highlighted the guitar work in &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and felt that the pair of &quot;uncharacteristic&quot; instrumentals &quot;pass for innovation.&quot;

In Britain, &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Johnny Cigarettes dismissed the group&#x27;s more serious direction, wishing for a return to the &quot;over-exuberant, good-time show metal about the simple pleasures in life&quot; that had typified the band&#x27;s tenure with David Lee Roth. He wrote that despite the promising lyrics for &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Big Fat Money&quot;, the music resembled a &quot;mess of blues, pseudo-epic folk, and Sammy Hagar&#x27;s bland gravel-u-like vocal blusterings&quot;, adding that the &quot;wanktackularly pretentious&quot; instrumentals further ruined the album. Andrew Mueller of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; similarly bemoaned how the band had become &quot;a flimsy pretext for the widdly-widdlying of Eddie van Halen and the ridiculous grunting of sweaty hod-carrier Sammy Hagar&quot;, dismissing the later for being &quot;caught halfway between Muttley from The Macc Lads and The Neph&#x27;s Carl McCoy.&quot;

Reviewing the album for &quot;Select&quot;, Clark Collis wrote that Van Halen had become humourless since Lee Roth&#x27;s departure, with &quot;Balance&quot; doing &quot;little to remedy&quot; this. He added: &quot;Naming a track &#x27;Seventh Seal&#x27; after the Ingmar Bergman movie may be an attempt to make an asset out of their dourness. But, 50 minutes of join-the-dots fretwork and dull HM shenanigans later, you decide.&quot; Deborah Frost of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that the songs &quot;sound as clumsily grafted together as the computer-manipulated Siamese-twin cover art&quot;, adding that although Eddie sporadically &quot;whips off the odd pantheon-worthy move&quot;, his bandmates &quot;might as well be on vacation.&quot; &quot;Centre Daily Times&quot; critic Howard Cohen believed the album lacked memorable melodies, with a wall of sound production that &quot;threatens to obscure Van Halen&#x27;s playing&quot;; but called it a &quot;step up&quot; from its &quot;uninspired and juvenile&quot; predecessor, &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that &quot;Balance&quot; &quot;tries to open up the Van Hagar formula somewhat&quot;, with Eddie placing stronger emphasis on subtle ballads and heavy rockers, but believes his attempts are &quot;weighed down by the most predictable rhythm section in all of rock &amp; roll, which gives each number the same unvarying deadlocked pulse, completely obliterating Eddie&#x27;s increased musical sensitivity.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;Balance&quot; is dismissed as &quot;a disgrace, from the pseudo-religious &#x27;The Seventh Seal&#x27; (featuring, for real, the monks of Gyuto Tantric University in Tibet) to Hagar&#x27;s ode to smoking &#x27;Panama red&#x27; in &#x27;Amsterdam&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Consequence&quot; writer Steven Ovadia considers it &quot;a shame&quot; that &quot;Balance&quot; was Hagar&#x27;s last album with Van Halen, because it &quot;hints at a possible musical shift that might have resulted in a different direction for the band&quot;. Commenting on Eddie&#x27;s full integration of keyboard sounds and riffs into his guitar work, he said: &quot;&quot;Balance&quot; saw Van Halen embrace a sonic shimmer that allowed him to evoke both instruments within one single performance in a way neither the guitarist nor the band had before, with Eddie flawlessly balancing the two.&quot;

==Legacy==
Sammy Hagar has since expressed mixed opinions on &quot;Balance&quot;, reflecting on its difficult production, but noted the presence of several great songs, including the &quot;Sammy grunge-type thing&quot; he pursued on &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot;, and deeming it to be &quot;more of a Sammy Hagar record than any of the other Van Halen albums. That is what&#x27;s odd about that.&quot; He wrote that Fairbairn gave him &quot;more trouble&quot; than any other producer during his time with Van Halen.

&quot;Balance&quot; is ranked at number 477 in Martin Popoff&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; (2010), compiled from the results of a large poll. Popoff himself believed the band were &quot;running on fumes&quot; by the recording of the album, despite the first-rate production of Fairbairn and Eddie and Alex &quot;shining brightly with their respective personal stamps&quot;. In rankings of the band&#x27;s albums, &quot;Balance&quot; has been ranked 11th best (second worst) by Matthew Wilkening of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, Eduardo RivadavIa of &quot;Loudwire&quot;, and the staff of &quot;Consequence&quot;.

Wilkening commented that songs like &quot;Don’t Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back (Deja Vu)&quot; showed Van Halen &quot;tackling more serious subjects and tones&quot;, but added that some songs &quot;come off rather lifeless, as if the chemistry within this lineup had already gone sour.&quot; Rivadavia deemed &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot; to be &quot;dialed in soft/hard singles&quot;, while &quot;everything else sounded like leftovers from VH&#x27;s previous album (not a terrible thing, but still). The inclusion of three instrumentals was, in retrospect, another dire omen of Eddie’s dwindling inspiration and Hagar’s diminishing interest.&quot; &quot;Consequence&quot; write that the album drags on far longer than other CD era-albums and add: &quot;It would be all too easy to point to the rise of grunge and alternative as the reason the band falls so far out of alignment here, but the album&#x27;s commercial success proves that losing currency wasn&#x27;t the issue. And it&#x27;s not like Van Halen were emulating grunge, or like they weren&#x27;t up for trying new things — the album is introduced with throat chanting courtesy of The Monks of Gyuto Tantric University, for example, while Eddie tries his hand at an Elton John/Billy Joel-style piano ballad on &quot;Not Enough.&quot; And yet the music is almost utterly bereft of inspiration.&quot;

<doc id="1130951" wikidata="Q4537333" url="?curid=1130951" title="Scribal abbreviation">
<text>Scribal abbreviations, or sigla (singular: siglum), are abbreviations used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in various languages, including Latin, Greek, Old English and Old Norse.

In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) sigla are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts).

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using sigla, arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials (stone, metal, parchment, etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, lapidaries, engravers, and copyists made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the Roman Republic, several abbreviations, known as sigla (plural of &quot;siglum&quot; &#x27;symbol or abbreviation&#x27;), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the Roman Empire. Additionally, in this period shorthand entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian Xenophon in the memoir of Socrates, and it was called . In the late Roman Republic, the Tironian notes were developed possibly by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero&#x27;s amanuensis, in 63 BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the Latin minuscule hand and square and rustic capital letters. The notation was akin to modern stenographic writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the Carolingians, who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a &quot;murky existence&quot; (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery ().

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. Sigla were mostly used in lapidary inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the Carolingian Renaissance (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called , were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called , appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ad hoc to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.

In epigraphy, common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called &quot;suspensions&quot; (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by &quot;contraction&quot; and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, or ; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: &quot;DM&quot; for (&#x27;Dedicated to the Manes&#x27;); &quot;IHS&quot; from the first three letters of ; and &quot;RIP&quot; for (&#x27;rest in peace&#x27;)) because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Traube, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation&#x27;s final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: denoted , thus, denoted ; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using to denote , they invented the form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a &quot;vinculum&quot; (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the &quot;tilde&quot; (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage. Besides the tilde and macron marks above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes.

The typographic abbreviations should not be confused with the phrasal abbreviations: &quot;i.e.&quot; ( &#x27;that is&#x27;); &quot;loc. cit.&quot; ( &#x27;in the passage already cited&#x27;); &quot;viz.&quot; ( &#x27;namely; that is to say; in other words&#x27; – formed with &quot;vi&quot; + the yogh-like glyph ꝫ, the siglum for the suffix &quot;-et&quot; and the conjunction ); and &quot;etc.&quot; (&quot;et cetera&quot; &#x27;and so on&#x27;).

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including ligatures (Æ, Œ, etc.), the long s (ſ), and the r rotunda (ꝛ). The &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; for vowels and &quot;v&quot; and &quot;j&quot; for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin ampersand (&amp;) replaces the conjunction &quot;and&quot; in English, in Latin and French, and in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the &quot;y&quot; is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign (⁊), resembling the digit seven (7), represents the conjunction &quot;et&quot; and is written only to the x-height; in current Irish language usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction (&#x27;and&#x27;). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the percentage sign (%), from the Italian (&#x27;per hundred&#x27;); the permille sign (‰), from the Italian (&#x27;per thousand&#x27;); the pound sign (₤, £ and #, all descending from or &quot;lb&quot; for ) and the dollar sign ($), which possibly derives from the Spanish word . The commercial at symbol (@), originally denoting &#x27;at the rate/price of&#x27;, is an abbreviation of the word Amphora—a kind of pot used as a unit of trade; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of e-mail addresses.

Typographically, the ampersand, representing the word &quot;et&quot;, is a space-saving ligature of the letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, its component graphemes. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), when Ancient Greek language manuscripts introduced that tongue to Western Europe, its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe&#x27;s vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-Latinist Protestant Reformation (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation &quot;Xmas&quot;, for &quot;Christmas&quot;, is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the Greek letter chi (Χ) for Christ&#x27;s name (deriving from the first letter in his name, ).

====Church Slavonic====

After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in Church Slavonic and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special diacritic symbol titlo, as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the (&#x27;Sacred names&#x27;) tradition of using contractions for certain frequently occurring names in Greek ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to &quot;good&quot; beings and the same words, when referring to &quot;bad&quot; beings, are spelled out; for example, while &quot;God&quot; in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as , &quot;god&quot; referring to false gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word meaning &#x27;angel&#x27; is generally abbreviated as , but the word meaning &#x27;angels&#x27; is spelled out for &#x27;performed by evil angels&#x27; in Psalm 77.

==Abbreviation types==
&#x27;s lists the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Vulgar Latin and Italian texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often copying errors. For example, &quot;e.g.&quot; is written with periods, but modern terms, such as &quot;PC&quot;, may be written in uppercase.

The original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to Western calligraphy or a beginner&#x27;s guide.

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two runes were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are &quot;fé&quot; (ᚠ &#x27;cattle, goods&#x27;) and &quot;maðr&quot; (ᛘ &#x27;man&#x27;).

 divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension ()
*by contraction ()
*with independent meaning ()
*with relative meaning ()
*by superscript letters ()
*by convention ()

===Suspension===

Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the ascender of the letters.
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:The third case is a stylistic alternative (vertical instead of oblique) of the ligatured cursive sign abbreviating various common finals in Latin like &quot;-um&quot;, &quot;-us&quot;, or &quot;-io&quot; (Latin Extended-D, Unicode chart), found in several fonts, here Andron.

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person&#x27;s name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: &quot;F.&quot; = and &quot;FF.&quot; = . Tripled sigla often stand for three: &quot;DDD&quot; = .

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored &quot;C&quot; (Ↄ) stands generally for or (the latter sometimes with a macron above: Ↄ̄).

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with an overline above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as (Greek letters chi + rho) = or = &quot;Jesus&quot;.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single-letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less ambiguous sigla with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
*pure: keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla
*mixed (impure): keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged

===Marks with independent meaning===
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (independent of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an &quot;n&quot; with a tilde (ñ) is used for . In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate &quot;m&quot;, and the same mark without a dot meant &quot;n&quot;. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark that resembles the Arabic numeral nine (ꝯ), or a mirrored &quot;C&quot; (ↄ) in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of Marcus Valerius Probus and Tironian notes with the same meaning as &quot;con&quot;.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript version of the previous mark (ꝰ), placed after the letter on the median line, represented &quot;us&quot; or &quot;os&quot;, generally at the end of the word, being the nominative case affix of the second declension, sometimes &quot;is&quot; or simply &quot;s&quot;. The apostrophe used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the Saxon genitive.
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing &quot;r&quot; (rhotic consonant) or &quot;ra&quot;. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing &quot;-a&quot; or syllable ending in &quot;-a&quot;. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small &quot;r&quot;-like mark and the other from an &quot;a&quot;-like one. In later texts, it became a diaeresis (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral two (2) and placed on the median line after the letter (e.g. eᷣ), indicates &quot;tur&quot; or &quot;ur&quot;, which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for &quot;ter&quot; or &quot;er&quot; but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in &quot;er&quot;.)
*The r rotunda with a cut (ꝵ) generally stood for &quot;-rum&quot; (a common genitive plural ending in Latin), but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter &quot;r&quot;.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note (⁊) or the ampersand (&amp;), was used with equal frequency as the conjunction &quot;et&quot; (&#x27;and&#x27;) or as &quot;et&quot; in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic &quot;-que&quot; (&#x27;and&#x27;). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the &quot;us&quot;/&quot;os&quot; mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===

The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: b̵, b̄ – &quot;bre-, ber-, -ub&quot;
*: c̄&quot; – (with a link on the right) – &quot;cum, con, cen-&quot;
*: ꝯ̄ – (above) – &quot;quondam&quot;
*: d̵, d̄ – &quot;de-, der, -ud&quot; (a crossed &quot;d&quot;, not &quot;ð&quot; = eth)
*: h̵, h̄ – &quot;haec, hoc, her&quot;
*: ꝉ – &quot;vel, ul-, -el&quot;
*: m̄ (above) – &quot;mem-, mun-&quot;
*: n̄ (above) – &quot;non, nun-&quot;
*: ꝋ (crossed horizontally, not Danish &quot;ø&quot;) – &quot;obiit&quot; (see: Theta infelix)
*: p̱ – &quot;per, par-, por-&quot;
*: p̄ (above) – &quot;prae, pre-&quot; (alternatively, a mark similar to &quot;-us&quot; comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter &quot;q&quot;)
*: p̄p̄ (above), p̱p̱ (below) – &quot;propter, papa&quot;
*: q̱ – &quot;qui&quot; and, in Italy, , but in England &quot;quam, quia&quot;
*: q̄ (above) – &quot;quae&quot;
*: q̄q̄ (above) or &quot;q̱q̱&quot; (below) – &quot;quoque&quot;
*: q̱̃ (tilde above and line below) – &quot;quam&quot;
*: t̵ – &quot;ter-, tem-, ten-&quot;
*: ū, v̄ (above) – &quot;ven-, ver, -vit&quot;

*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the mark like an Arabic numeral three (ꝫ) were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After &quot;b&quot;, they mean &quot;-us&quot; (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean &quot;-et&quot;). After &quot;q&quot;, they form the conjunction &quot;-que&quot; (meaning &quot;and&quot; but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the &quot;q&quot; could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above &quot;s&quot; meant &quot;-sis&quot;. The dot above median line on an &quot;h&quot; – &quot;hoc&quot;. Dot above &quot;u&quot; – &quot;ut&quot; or &quot;uti&quot;. The ꝫ could mean &quot;-est&quot;, or after &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;u&quot; vowels meant &quot;-m&quot; not &quot;us&quot; or &quot;ei&quot;, if after an &quot;o&quot; it meant &quot;-nem&quot;. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut &quot;r&quot; rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: &quot;e&quot; – &quot;.e.&quot; &quot;est&quot;, &quot;i&quot; – &quot;.i.&quot; &quot;id est&quot;, &quot;n&quot; – &quot;.n.&quot; &quot;enim&quot;, &quot;q&quot; – &quot;.q.&quot; &quot;quasi&quot;, &quot;s&quot; – &quot;.s.&quot; &quot;scilicet&quot;, &quot;t&quot; – &quot;.t.&quot; &quot;tune&quot;, .ꝯ. – &quot;quondam&quot;, .⁊. &quot;etiam&quot;.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing &quot;er&quot;, &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;re&quot;. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the &quot;us&quot; mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a &quot;q&quot; – &quot;qꝛ&quot; &quot;quia&quot;. After 15th century alone ꝛ &quot;et&quot; (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ &quot;etiam&quot;. After &quot;u&quot; and &quot;a&quot; at the end of a word (&quot;uꝛ&quot;, &quot;aꝛ&quot;) &quot;m&quot;, after &quot;s&quot; – &quot;sꝛ&quot;, &quot;ſꝛ&quot; &quot;et&quot; or &quot;ed&quot;.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter &quot;r&quot;, before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter &quot;r&quot; before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is &quot;r-coloured&quot;.

However, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;o&quot; above &quot;g&quot; meant &quot;gͣ&quot; &quot;gna&quot;, &quot;gͥ&quot; &quot;gni&quot; and &quot;gͦ&quot; &quot;gno&quot; respectively. Although in English, the &quot;g&quot; is silent in &quot;gn&quot;, but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above &quot;q&quot; meant &quot;qu&quot; + vowel: &quot;qͣ&quot;, &quot;qͤ&quot;, &quot;qͥ&quot;, &quot;qͦ&quot;, &quot;qͧ&quot;.

*&quot;a&quot; on &quot;r&quot;: &quot;rͣ&quot; – &quot;regula&quot;
*&quot;o&quot; on &quot;m&quot;: &quot;mͦ&quot; – &quot;modo&quot;

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were &quot;c&quot;, e.g. &quot;nͨ&quot;. A cut &quot;l&quot; above an &quot;n&quot;, &quot;nᷝ&quot;, meant &quot;nihil&quot; for instance.

For numerals, double-x superscripts are sometimes used to express scores, i. e. multiplication by twenty. For example, IIIIxx indicates 80, VIxxXI indicates 131.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as &quot;letter-like glyphs&quot;. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are alchemical and zodiac symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

Some important examples are two stacked horizontal lines (looks like =) for &quot;esse&quot; (&#x27;to be&#x27;), and an obelus consisting of a horizontal line and two dots (looks like ÷) for &quot;est&quot; (&#x27;it is&#x27;).

==Other==
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla. Many more ligatures were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts. Some letter variants such as r rotunda, long s and uncial or insular variants (Insular G), Claudian letters were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: thorn (þ) and eth (ð), each representing the English &quot;th&quot; sounds. An illuminated manuscript would feature miniatures, decorated initials or &quot;littera notabilior&quot;, which later resulted in the bicamerality of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
Various typefaces have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include &quot;record type&quot;, which was first developed in the 1770s to publish Domesday Book and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===

In the Unicode Standard v. 5.1 (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts &quot;Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement&quot; (26 characters), &quot;Latin Extended Additional&quot; (10 characters), &quot;Supplemental Punctuation&quot; (15 characters), &quot;Ancient Symbols&quot; (12 characters) and especially &quot;Latin Extended-D&quot; (89 characters).
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in LaTeX or using overstrike in MS Word).

Characters are &quot;the smallest components of written language that have semantic value&quot; but glyphs are &quot;the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed&quot;.

<doc id="1130966" wikidata="Q344153" url="?curid=1130966" title="İsmail Cem">
<text>İsmail Cem (born İsmail Cem İpekçi, 15 February 1940 – 24 January 2007) was a Turkish centre-leftist politician, intellectual, writer, author and journalist who served as the Minister of Culture of Turkey from July 7 to October 26, 1995, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey from June 30, 1997 to July 11, 2002.

== Background ==
İsmail Cem finished high school at Robert College in İstanbul in 1959 and graduated from the Law School at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland in 1963. He had his master&#x27;s degree in sociology of politics at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in 1983, Paris, France. He was an exchange student with AFS Intercultural Programs at Piedmont High School, Piedmont California for one year during his high school years after Işık Koleji.

Cem was the cousin of murdered liberal-leftist journalist, intellectual and human rights activist Abdi İpekçi, the editor in chief for then centre-leftist Milliyet newspaper. Cem was the son of İhsan İpekçi (1901-1966), who was one of the pioneers of the Turkish cinema industry, as the founder and partner of İpek Film, and several popular Istanbul movie theaters including Yeni Melek and İpek and his mother Zerife. İsmail Cem was an avid photographer, and held four photo exhibits in his lifetime, and published a book &quot;Mevsim, Mevsim&quot; (&quot;Seasons, Seasons&quot;).

== Journalism ==
Returning home in 1963, Cem started his professional career as a journalist. He worked in some major newspapers who published articles and became a columnist for Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and Politika, where he served as the editor in chief for the second newspaper from 1964 until 1966. Between 1971 and 1974, he served as the chief of the Istanbul office within the Turkish Newspaper Workers Union. In 1974–1975, he acted as the general manager of the state-owned Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) under the 37th and 38th governments. Cem&#x27;s tenure as the general manager of TRT, then the only TV station in Turkey, created some controversy. The conservatives and prominent right-wing figures like future President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel used their political and social influence to remove İpekçi from his post in several attempts, which have all proven fruitless.

== Writing career ==
Among with his political and journalistic successes, İpekçi is also known as one of the ideologists of social democracy in Turkey, and was counted among the prominent figures within the Turkish centre-left. İpekçi, who advocated a moderate agenda in a time of political turmoil, wrote extensive accounts of the economic and social factors lying beneath Turkey&#x27;s underdevelopment and theorized methods for the revitalization of Turkish left. Among his books are &quot;Turkiye&#x27;de Geri Kalmışlığın Tarihi&quot; (A History of Underdevelopment in Turkey), one of the most acclaimed books in the field of social sciences in Turkey and &quot;Sosyal Demokrasi Nedir?, Ne Değildir?&quot; (What is and What is not Social Democracy?), one of the first books to introduce social democracy to Turkish politics. İpekçi&#x27;s books, characterized by their plain but informative nature, are still popular and are growing even more popular, especially in light of the current dissent against AKP&#x27;s Islamism and the debate of reformation in Turkish left. He is also labeled as the visionary of the &quot;Anatolian Left (Anadolu Solu)&quot; . A more detailed bibliography of his works can be found below.

== Political career ==

He entered politics after being elected deputy of Istanbul from the Kadıköy district in the general elections held in 1987. He was re-elected in 1991 again from Istanbul and in 1995 from Kayseri. After the death of President Turgut Özal in 1993, he ran for president without success. In 1995, Cem left the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) and joined the Democratic Left Party (DSP). He was then appointed Minister of Culture. He served as minister of foreign affairs from 30 June 1997 until 11 July 2002. He was the fourth longest-serving minister of this position in Turkey.

===Relations with the European Union===
He negotiated candidate status for Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the European Union as foreign minister. He was largely credited with Turkey&#x27;s declaration as a full member candidate during the Helsinki Summit Meeting in 1999, after much negotiation with the EU and a night trip by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and the then European Commissioner Günter Verheugen to Ankara to iron out the last details.

===Relations with Greece===
Cem and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou worked to improve Turkish-Greek relations. It is during his tenure as foreign minister that a confident, albeit a step-by-step approach was taken towards a rapprochement between Turkey and Greece. The relations were actually at an all-time low after the Abdullah Öcalan affair, whereby Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and some officials of the Greek Foreign Ministry were involved in hiding organization PKK leader prior to his arrest by the Turkish police. İpekçi and Papandreou picked up the historically hostile relationships initially starting with some confidence measures.

== Later political career and illness ==
After a dispute with the party leader Bülent Ecevit, he resigned from the Democratic Left Party (DSP) ahead of 2002 parliamentary elections and formed the New Turkey Party (YTP) on 20 July 2002 together with his former party colleague Hüsamettin Özkan and Zeki Eker. İsmail Cem was elected leader of YTP, which did not do well in the elections.

Returning from the United States, where he was due to medical treatment of pulmonary cancer, he closed YTP on 24 October 2004, joining the CHP, despite newly affiliated with the SDHP until his death. İsmail Cem was acting as the chief advisor to Deniz Baykal, the leader of CHP, and lectured in Applied Foreign Politics of Turkey at the Istanbul Bilgi University until his death.

He was married to Elçin Trak, and the couple had a daughter, İpek Cem Taha, and a son, Kerim Cem.

==Funeral==

İsmail Cem died on 24 January 2007 in İstanbul after suffering for two years from lung cancer. He was honored with a state funeral, at which Speaker of the Parliament Bülent Arınç, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, current and former leaders of the political parties, his close friend former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, George Papandreou and Greek Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodoros Kasimis attended.

He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Papandreou laid on his grave a branch from the olive tree they both had planted 2000 in Greece as a symbol of peace.

== Legacy ==
İsmail Cem was especially admired by young people in Turkey during his time as a foreign minister. Some polls indicated that young people desired to see Cem as President of Turkey. İsmail Cem&#x27;s biography written by Turkish political scientist Ozan Örmeci, &quot;Portrait of a Turkish Social Democrat: İsmail Cem&quot; and its Turkish version &quot;Bir Türk Sosyal Demokratı: İsmail Cem&quot; found many readers among Turkish intellectuals and showed Cem&#x27;s unique place in Turkish social democratic movement.

<text>Mangajin was a monthly English-language magazine for students of Japanese language and culture by Mangajin, Inc. It was distinct from many other magazines of its type in that it unabashedly embraced Japanese popular culture, as a learning tool and a route towards rapid acclimation into Japanese society. Each issue featured selections from various popular manga translated into English with detailed cultural and linguistic commentary.

It was a unique language learning tool in that the manga that it excerpted showed the use of the language in various types of informal conversations. It would feature a few pages of manga with explanations of the grammar used and when that grammar/vocabulary combination might be appropriate. By contrast, most Japanese language textbooks for early students focus on formal versions of the language appropriate for business discussions.

The magazine ceased publication in December 1997 (issue 70) due to financial hardship. The name is a combination of the Japanese words for and .

==History==
&quot;Mangajin&quot; began shaping in 1988, when businessman and translator Vaughan P. Simmons began making prototypes of a magazine that could combine Japanese popular culture, entertainment, and language learning into one. Simmons worked with clients from American and European companies and saw how successful they could be with the Japanese and learned the culture, which boosted up the motivation for &quot;Mangajin&quot;. When developing the concept, manga became an ideal solution with the medium being so large and attracting some of the best artists and writers. Manga also gives a big perspective on real Japanese society and how the language is spoken. Simmons started creating a &quot;four-line-format&quot; which shows the actual text as found in a Japanese manga, a romanization for pronunciation, a literal translation showing the structure of the expression, and an idiomatic English equivalent.

Beginning with issue #49, the magazines include companion audio tapes for the corresponding issues until the end of the print edition at issue #70. Each tape contains audio reenactments of all of the Japanese manga material in that issue. Side A contains the stories acted by native Japanese-speaking voice actors. Side B contains stories read without pause, first in Japanese, then in English. For some of the longer/wordier issues, part of the line-by-line recording from Side A runs over onto Side B.

North American versions were distributed by Weatherhill, Inc. Following the end of print magazine publication, Wasabi Brothers Trading Company and Rolomail Trading became publishers for Mangajin materials. Following the purchases of Weatherhill, Inc. by Shambhala Publications, Mangajin materials were published by Shambhala Publications.

Japanese versions were distributed by Sekai Shuppan, inc.

<doc id="1130973" wikidata="Q1761720" url="?curid=1130973" title="The Greater Wrong of the Right">
<text>The Greater Wrong of the Right is the ninth studio album by Canadian electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy, released by SPV on May 25, 2004. It is their first full-length record since 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Process&quot;. It is also their first album since 1985&#x27;s &quot;Bites&quot; without the support of keyboardist Dwayne Goettel, who died in 1995, and their first album since the departure of producer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie. It was produced by Cevin Key and is Ohgr-collaborator Mark Walk&#x27;s first appearance as an official member of the band. The album&#x27;s artwork was created by longtime collaborator Steven R. Gilmore.

After the difficult recording of &quot;The Process&quot;, band members Key and Nivek Ogre chose to focus on solo projects before accepting an offer to perform as Skinny Puppy at the Doomsday Festival in 2000. Afterward, Key and Ogre reformed the band with Walk and recorded new material throughout 2003. Stylistically, the album is a departure from their earlier work as the band wished to explore more melodic song structures. It also features contributions from musicians such as Danny Carey and Wayne Static. The album was promoted by the single &quot;Pro-test&quot; and by a world tour.

&quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, who complimented its style and production. The album reached number 176 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and appeared on several other charts.

==Background==
Following the troubled recording of their 1996 album &quot;The Process&quot;, which ended with the death of keyboardist Dwayne Goettel, the surviving members of Skinny Puppy disbanded and sought alternative musical outlets. Nivek Ogre began work on his Ohgr project with Mark Walk and recorded the album &quot;Bedside Toxicology&quot; with Martin Atkins; Cevin Key made Download his primary focus and also released his first solo album, &quot;Music for Cats&quot;, in 1998; and producer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie began working with acts such a Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, and David Bowie.

In 2000, Key and Ogre reunited for a one-off performance as Skinny Puppy at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden. Ogilvie declined an invitation to participate in the show. Afterwards, the pair traveled to Prague where they discussed the possibility of producing a new Skinny Puppy album that would take the band&#x27;s sound in a new direction. Until they could produce the album, they took to contributing to each other&#x27;s solo projects. After scoring a deal with SPV, the pair officially reformed Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Walk. Their first new song together, titled &quot;Optimissed&quot;, was included on the &quot;Underworld&quot; soundtrack.

Key and Ogre both observed how positively their relationship had developed since their reunion, noting in particular a respect for each other&#x27;s opinions which had been absent in the past. Key attributed his rekindled partnership with Ogre to their sobriety from hard drugs, saying &quot;we have a few drinks, and we smoke weed. Every other drug only pulled us away from being better at what we could have been.&quot; Ogre remarked, &quot;why hold to your grave these irrelevant reasons not to have a relationship with someone you shared so much of your life with?&#x27; I spent a lot of time with this guy making music, you know?&quot; Ogilvie formed his own band, Jakalope, in 2003 and did not return to Skinny Puppy.

==Composition==
The band avoided external influences when recording the album, instead opting to seek inspiration from their previous work and hone elements that they thought they could expand on. This included using synthesizers that had been employed in the recording of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Remission&quot;, some of which were utilized in the song &quot;Past Present&quot;. Key also used a wide variety of new equipment when composing, explaining that it &quot;helped us to do a better job at what we&#x27;ve always done&quot;. Other inspiration came from shared experiences; the song &quot;Goneja&quot; was inspired by a trip Key and Ogre took to Jamaica. Additional musicians were brought in, including support from Tool drummer Danny Carey and Static-X frontman Wayne Static. Key worked with guest musicians one-on-one to avoid &quot;making it an overwhelming situation with too many cooks in the kitchen&quot;. The band dropped the jam session style of music making they had used in the past and adopted a more focused style of writing, where one member would come up with an idea and the others would take turns expanding on it. The band produced 40 demo tracks from which Ogre choose what he felt best suited his lyrics.

Commenting on the album&#x27;s sound, Key said he knew people would be divided on the band&#x27;s direction. He continued, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard some people complaining, like, &#x27;Ohhh, there&#x27;s just not enough pure hardcore noise or completely discombobulated beats,&#x27; and it&#x27;s like, well, maybe we&#x27;ll get there again! We could have made a solid noise album, but that would have been an album that sounded like not so much of a progression to us&quot;. Ogre agreed with Key&#x27;s sentiment:

I think the passage of time has painted us into a corner of being something so chaotic and so incredibly dark, but if you go back over our catalog there&#x27;s a lot of moments where there are softness and a less abrasive and very melodic aspect to what we did. We&#x27;ve always had that within us -- we&#x27;re not just doing this to be these malevolent, malignant tumoresque musicians who are continually delving into the evil side of life and supporting it to the very end! 

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; was released worldwide on May 25, 2004. The album was released as a digipack with a cardboard sleeve. The German promotional release came in a jewelcase and included the early working titles for songs. The Japanese release was distributed by Nippon Crown and came in a jewel case with a cardboard slipcover. It included a foldable booklet with a biography of the band and song translations in Japanese.

The album reached number 176 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and the number one position on the &quot;Deutsche Alternative Charts&quot;. It also reached the number nine and seven spots on &quot;Billboards&quot; Independent Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts, respectively. The band released a music video for the song &quot;Pro-test&quot; directed by long-time collaborator William Morrison. The video depicts a rivalry between two groups of breakdancers and was inspired by Morrison&#x27;s previous video work documenting the dance style.

The album was re-released by Metropolis Records on January 28, 2014.

===Tour===

Following the album&#x27;s release, Skinny Puppy embarked on a large world tour which included shows in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Their first show of the tour was at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. An additional 20 date North American tour began in October 2004. Supporting musicians included Chris Vrenna&#x27;s solo project Tweaker and Otto Von Schirach, who worked on the album. Key performed keyboard duties while Morrison joined the band as guitarist. Justin Bennett was hired as the band&#x27;s live drummer. Key&#x27;s custom made drum kit, dubbed the &quot;drumasaurous&quot;, was not utilized as it had been on previous tours. Key&#x27;s initial plan was for Carey to play drums, but he was unable join due to scheduling conflicts. A full schedule also caused the band to declined a spot on the 2004 Lollapalooza tour, which was ultimately cancelled due to poor ticket sales. According to Key, several shows, including a date in Israel, were cancelled due to the financial costs of transporting their gear. The band returned to Europe in 2005 for several festival dates including appearances at the Sziget Festival and M&#x27;era Luna Festival.

The costume used at the beginning of each show was designed by Ogre and built by a company called Cyberoptics. Ogre wanted the suit to invoke images of both a canine and a plague doctor, but admitted it resembled &quot;more of a soldier like character&quot;. The anti-Bush administration stance presented during the stageshow, which included caricatures of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney performing a mock execution of Ogre, prompted the conservative group Patriot Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood to attempt a boycott of college radio stations that played Skinny Puppy. Over the course of the tour, Ogre suffered several allergic reactions to the fake blood he used onstage and received chemical burns in his eyes at a show in Seattle. He said the reactions were likely caused by the flour he used to make the fake blood. A concert film was recorded using footage from shows in Montreal and Toronto, and released as &quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right Live&quot; in 2005.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Greater Wrong of the Right&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with an average score of 79 based on 7 reviews on review aggregator Metacritic. Scott Schinder of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;While its accessible sound may alienate longtime fans, Greater Wrong suggests this Puppy is heading for a rewarding adulthood&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Alexander Chow said the album was &quot;More polished and less textured, but still a diabolical nightmare&quot;. Paul Robicheau from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote &quot;They&#x27;re no longer the scary Puppy of the Eighties that inspired Nine Inch Nails. But there is still enough edge - musical and political - to fuel this streamlined return&quot;. &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; said that the album &quot;represents a kind of an aesthetic bridge, taking the best elements of contemporary metal, glitch and post-&#x27;90s industrial, and combining them in a way that will appeal to dyed-in-the-wool Puppy fans&quot; and newer listeners.

Mark Adair from &quot;Exclaim!&quot; criticized the album&#x27;s first two songs for being too radio-friendly, but praised the closing tracks, concluding that &quot;This disc goes from commercial to brilliant in ten songs. It is a more accessible sound than previous efforts, but still a solid entry to the band&#x27;s discography&quot;. Norman Narvaja of the &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; praised the album, saying &quot;In many ways, instead of clinging to old methods, the songs reflect where the players are in 2004&quot;, and concluded by saying the record &quot;confronts and challenges both old and new listeners&quot;. In a review for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Christa L. Titus described the album as &quot;a riveting set that draws from the act&#x27;s complex, mechanical palette&quot;. Jim Abbott of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said the album demonstrated &quot;the band&#x27;s ability to unite muscle with message&quot;. He praised songs such as &quot;Empte&quot; and &quot;Use Less&quot; for their lyrics and &quot;tribal beats&quot;, and concluded that &quot;the band&#x27;s ability to again make music of such demanding complexity suggests that all is not lost&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; said the album was the band&#x27;s most melodic and concluded &quot;the album exudes an energy that was mostly sporadic in their previous material&quot;.

Some critics were less positive, such as Nick Lewis from the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; who stated that while the album was &quot;not essential&quot;, it &quot;showcases a band that, 22 years later, is still relevant and ahead of its peers&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Mark Jenkins said the album was &quot;a credible but generally unsurprising attempt&quot; from the band, but commended more melodic tracks such as &quot;Empte&quot; and &quot;Past Present&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries described the album as &quot;The Process&quot; &quot;done right&quot;, but criticized songs such as &quot;Neuworld&quot;. However, he continued that the album sounded &quot;more inspired&quot; than their previous effort and concluded that with &quot;stunning structure from Key, it beats most of the current industrial music competition&quot;.

In a negative review for &quot;The Spectrum&quot;, Rustin Reber panned the album for its lack of guitar work, calling it &quot;electronic noise&quot;. He concluded, &quot;I&#x27;m probably prejudice against those who create every part of an entire song with a MIDI controller and recorded samples of music, but I doubt this is anything appealing to the few souls reading this article&quot;.

it is the largest sculpture of Lord Balaji in Asia.

This idol is made in a single black stone. There is a yearly celebration for Lord Balaji. Everyday visitors/tourists and the poor are provided with free food.

===Kanchani mahal===
In local folklore, the structure is connected with many tales and mysteries.

The structure and the bricks are of Mughal architectural pattern and was designed for camping of an army and housing a very high ranking army officer of those times.

The aforesaid monument is currently in ruins due to the lack of attention from the ASI. However, the story connected to Kanchani Mahal seems to be a myth. Looking at the ruins one could easily gauge that the bricks are of Mughalia shapes and the monument would have been constructed to house and camp a general (or Shahenshah) of Aurangazeb&#x27;s stature during Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj&#x27;s period in their campaign to crush the rising of the great Maratha warrior.

According to local people, Kanchani Mahal was a seven storeyed palace constructed by a king to his concubine (known as Kanchani in Hindi) to provide a safe place for her and to protect her from public humiliation. From the top of the seventh storey, she was able to see the temple and lighthouse in the village without needing to travel to the temple directly. She is said to have committed suicide from the seventh storey since she was often ridiculed by the public that her palace is on a higher level than the temple in the village. The building was constructed using a cementing material made of cow dung, which provided natural insulation from heat and cold. Today only two storeys remain and the rest of the building is deteriorated. The palace is estimated to be roughly 400 years old by the local people of Mehkar.

The ASI will be the right authority to ascertain the truth if they take an interest.

N G Deshpande, renowned poet of Maharashtra, composed extensively on Kanchan Mahal.

Kiran Shivhar Dongardive, another renowned poet from Mehkar has composed some poems on Kanchani Mahal. His poem is a work of fiction and cannot be construed as reality.
However, Kanchani in Marathi as well as in Hindi dialect literally means a Courtesan or a dancing girl meant to entertain clients of higher class.

===Painganga River===
Mehkar is on the banks of the Painganga River, another name of Paingnga river is &#x27;Pranhita&#x27;, which provides multiple recreational activities. On the bank of this river there is Saoji Galli. In it, there is an old Vitthal mandir rather first Vitthal mandir in Mehkar, idol of this Vitthal, got in hands of Kimbahune Anster in Vari, to Ananta Shastri, it was a very religious place. A religious story is also attached to the Painganaga River that this river is formed by falling out of &quot;Pranita Patram&quot; from lord Vishanu&#x27;s hand and has on location and story also mentioned in &quot;Padma Puram&quot;. At the site of the Olandeshwar Tempel river Painganga changes its direction when the water level is low.

<doc id="1130982" wikidata="Q2790777" url="?curid=1130982" title="Yokosuka Naval Arsenal">
<text>was one of four principal naval shipyards owned and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was located at Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture on Tokyo Bay, south of Yokohama.

==History==

In 1866, the Tokugawa shogunate government established the &quot;Yokosuka Seisakusho&quot;, a military arsenal and naval base, with the help of foreign engineers, including the French naval architect Léonce Verny. The new facility was intended to produce modern, western-style warships and equipment for the Tokugawa navy. The construction of the arsenal was an important first step for the modernization of Japan&#x27;s industry. Modern buildings, an aqueduct, foundry, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.

After the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration, the new Meiji government took over control of the facility in 1871, renaming it the &quot;Yokosuka Zosenjo&quot; (Yokosuka Shipyards). The first dry dock was opened in 1871, and is still in operation today. Japan&#x27;s first domestically produced warship, &quot;Saiki&quot;, was completed the same year.

The Yokosuka Naval District was established at Yokosuka, Kanagawa, in 1884, as the first of the naval districts responsible for the defense of the Japanese home islands, and the Yokosuka Shipyards was renamed the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1903. Japan had purchased five submarines from the American Electric Boat Company during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. These Holland Type VII submarines were built by Arthur Leopold Busch as he traveled to Japan during this time. Busch was a naval architect and shipbuilder who represented the newly organized company Electric Boat Company, now located at the Quincy, Massachusetts shipyard known as the Fore River Ship and Engine Company. These first five submarines became Japan&#x27;s (IJN) initial entry into the theater of underwater warfare that began nearly the same time as the outbreak of the war. Another representative of Electric Boat, Frank Cable, an electrician working for Isaac L. Rice&#x27;s company, trained two Japanese crews in the operation of such craft.

Arthur Busch was also the man responsible for building the United States Navy&#x27;s first submarine some five or so years before this time for the Holland Torpedo Boat Company. This particular craft was named the and was America&#x27;s first commissioned craft of this type. Two additional Holland-designed submarines were built for Japan by 1906 &quot;under contract&quot; and a licensing &quot;agreement&quot; with Holland&#x27;s company back in 1905. These pioneering submarines progressively got larger and larger as time went on, climaxing (in size) by the end of the Cold War. In 1909, Japan&#x27;s first domestically designed and produced battleship, , was launched.

Yokosuka became one of the main shipyards of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 20th century, building numerous battleships such as , and aircraft carriers such as and . Naval aircraft were designed at the nearby Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal.

During the Pacific War, the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was attacked by one bomber during the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 and by a large force of carrier aircraft during the Attack on Yokosuka on 18 July 1945. The facilities were seized by Allied forces at the end of World War II, and on 15 October 1945 the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was officially abolished.

The facilities were used after World War II by the U.S. Navy as the &quot;Yokosuka Ship Repair Facility&quot;, and its former property is now under the control of the U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka.

A steam hammer from the former Yokosuka Naval Arsenal is on display at the Verny Commemorative Museum in Yokosuka.

<doc id="1130983" wikidata="Q515965" url="?curid=1130983" title="Fort Frontenac">
<text>Fort Frontenac was a French trading post and military fort built in July 1673 at the mouth of the Cataraqui River where the St. Lawrence River leaves Lake Ontario (at what is now the western end of the La Salle Causeway), in a location traditionally known as Cataraqui. It is the present-day location of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The original fort, a crude, wooden palisade structure, was called Fort Cataraqui but was later named for Louis de Buade de Frontenac, Governor of New France who was responsible for building the fort. It was abandoned and razed in 1689, then rebuilt in 1695.

The British destroyed the fort in 1758 during the Seven Years&#x27; War and its ruins remained abandoned until the British took possession and reconstructed it in 1783. In 1870–71 the fort was turned over to the Canadian military, who continue to use it.

==History==
===Establishment and early use===
The intent of Fort Frontenac was to control the lucrative fur trade in the Great Lakes Basin to the west and the Canadian Shield to the north. It was one of many French outposts that would be established throughout the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi regions. The fort was meant to be a bulwark against the English who were competing with the French for control of the fur trade. By constructing the trading post the French could encourage trade with the Iroquois, who were traditionally a threat to the French because of their alliance with the English. Another function of the fort was the provision of supplies and reinforcements to other French installations on the Great Lakes and in the Ohio Valley to the south.

Explorer René Robert Cavalier de La Salle was ordered by governor Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle to select a location for a fort. He selected the strategic junction of Lake Ontario, the Cataraqui River, and the St. Lawrence River. Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac, de Courcelle&#x27;s successor, was concerned about further Iroquois threats, and endorsed La Salle&#x27;s proposal. Governor Frontenac and his close associates also hoped to personally benefit from building the fort by controlling trade. Frontenac, along with his entourage, journeyed up the St. Lawrence to the fort&#x27;s future site where he met leaders of the Five Nations of the Iroquois on July 12, 1673 to encourage them to trade with the French, and to begin the fort&#x27;s construction. The fort, which was constructed of wood surrounded by a wooden stockade consisting of sharpened poles, was completed within six days. La Salle administered the fort and built storage buildings and dwellings, brought in domestic animals and ensured some land outside the fort was cultivated with the aim of attracting settlers.

The fort was sited to protect a small sheltered bay (the &quot;cannotage&quot;) that the French could use as a harbour for large lake-going boats. Unlike the Ottawa River fur trade route into the interior, which was only accessible by canoes, larger vessels could easily navigate the lower lakes. The cost of transporting goods such as furs, trade items, and supplies through at least the lower Great Lakes would be reduced.

La Salle was granted seigneurial privileges in the vicinity of the fort. In return for these privileges, La Salle was obliged to reimburse Frontenac for expenses related to building the fort, keep 20 workers onsite for two years, and maintain the fort. In 1675, La Salle rebuilt the structure. Stone bastions and a stone wall were constructed to strengthen the fort and much of the wooden pallisade was rebuilt. He was also required to attract settlers and meet their spiritual needs by building a chapel and establishing a mission with one or two Recollet priests. A description of the fort written in the 17th century mentions that:

La Salle used Fort Frontenac as a convenient base for his explorations into the interior of North America.

===Iroquois siege and reconstruction===

Fur trade rivalries continued to cause friction between the French and the Iroquois in the 1680s. The French began a campaign against the Iroquois to resolve the Iroquois threat, beginning with Governor Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre&#x27;s unsuccessful expedition to Fort Frontenac and into Seneca territory south of Lake Ontario in 1684. In 1687 La Barre&#x27;s successor, the Marquis de Denonville, gathered an army to travel into the Seneca territory. To quell suspicion about his motives, Denonville let on that he was merely travelling to a peace council at Fort Frontenac. As Denonville and his army moved up the St. Lawrence toward the fort, several Iroquois, many of whom were friendly to the French, including women and children and some prominent leaders, were captured and imprisoned at Fort Frontenac by intendant de Champigny ostensibly to prevent them from revealing Denonville&#x27;s troops&#x27; location. Some were held hostage and sent to Montreal in the event that any French were captured, and some were sent to France to be used as galley slaves. Denonville&#x27;s troops and native allies went on to attack the Seneca.

In retaliation for these incidents the Iroquois laid siege to Fort Frontenac and blockaded Lake Ontario. The fort and the settlement at Cataraqui were besieged for two months in 1688. Although the fort was not destroyed, the settlement was devastated and many inhabitants died, mostly from scurvy. The French abandoned and destroyed the fort in 1689, claiming that its remoteness prevented proper defense and that it could not be adequately supplied. However, the French again took possession of the fort in 1695, and it was rebuilt and strengthened to serve primarily as a military base of operations. It was from Fort Frontenac that a 2,000-strong French force organized an attack on the Iroquois who inhabited areas south of Lake Ontario.

Increased tension between the British and the French in the 1740s led to the French upgrading the fort&#x27;s defensive capabilities by adding new guns, building new barracks and increasing the size of the garrison. However, when the Marquis de Montcalm arrived at the fort in 1756 to launch an attack on the British at Oswego, he was not impressed with its construction. One of his engineers noted that:

The fort&#x27;s strategic significance gradually decreased as other forts such as Fort Niagara, Fort Detroit, and Fort Michilimackinac with commanding positions on the new trade routes became more important. By the 1750s, Fort Frontenac essentially served only as a supply storage depot and harbour for French naval vessels, and its garrison had dwindled.

===Battle of Fort Frontenac===
During the Seven Years&#x27; War between Britain and France, who were vying for control of the North American continent, the British considered Fort Frontenac to be a strategic threat since it was in a position to command transportation and communications to other French fortifications and outposts along the St. Lawrence – Great Lakes water route and in the Ohio Valley. Although not as important as it once was, the fort was still a base from which the western outposts were supplied. The British reasoned that if they were to disable the fort, supplies would be cut off and the outposts would no longer be able to defend themselves. The trade with Indian trade in the upper country (the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot;) would also be disrupted.

Fort Frontenac was also regarded as a threat to Fort Oswego, which had been built by the British across the lake from Fort Frontenac in 1722 to compete with Fort Frontenac for the Indian trade, and later enhanced as a military establishment. General Montcalm had already used Fort Frontenac as a staging point to attack the fortifications at Oswego in August 1756.

The British also hoped that taking the well-known fort would boost troop morale and honour after their demoralizing battle defeat at Fort Ticonderoga (Fort Carillon) in July 1758.

In August 1758, the British under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Bradstreet left Fort Oswego with a force of a little over 3,000 men and attacked Fort Frontenac. The fort&#x27;s garrison was a mere 110 persons, including five officers and 48 enlisted men of the regular colonial troops, plus employees, women, children, eight Indians, and others commanded by Pierre-Jacques Payen de Noyan et de Chavoy. The garrison surrendered and was allowed to leave; Bradstreet captured the fort&#x27;s supplies and nine French naval vessels, and destroyed much of the fort. He quickly departed to avoid further conflict with any French support troops.

For the British, the victory meant that Fort Oswego was secured, and the army&#x27;s reputation was restored. For the French, the fort&#x27;s loss was considered to be only a temporary setback. Fort Frontenac&#x27;s surrender did not succeed in completely severing French communications and transportation to the west since other routes were available (e.g. the Ottawa River – Lake Huron route). Supplies could also be moved west from other French posts (e.g. Fort de La Présentation). In the long term, however, the surrender compromised French prestige among the Indians and contributed to the defeat of New France in North America. Since the fort was no longer perceived to be important to the French, it was never rebuilt and was left abandoned for the next 25 years.

French imperial power was waning in the late 1750s, and by 1763 France had withdrawn from the North American mainland. Cataraqui and the remains of Fort Frontenac were relinquished to the British at the Treaty of Paris.

===Reconstruction and modern times===

In 1783, the Cataraqui region was selected by the British as a location to settle United Empire Loyalists who had fled the United States after the American Revolutionary War. The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers&#x27; quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as Tête-de-Pont Barracks. During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops. Many of the present barrack buildings were built between 1821 and 1824.

After British imperial forces withdrew from most Canadian locations in 1870–71, the Canadian Militia authorized the creation of two batteries of garrison artillery which provided garrison duties and schools of gunnery. &quot;&quot;A&quot; &quot; Battery School of Gunnery was established at Tête-de-Pont Barracks and other locations in Kingston (&quot;&quot;B&quot; &quot; Battery was located in Quebec). These batteries were known as the Regiment of Canadian Artillery. When this regiment evolved into the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA), its headquarters was at the Tête-de-Pont Barracks from 1905 to 1939. When the RCHA left for operational duties during the Second World War, the fort was used as a personnel depot.

On 25 May 1923, the site of Fort Frontenac was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.

In 1939 the site of the fort again became known as Fort Frontenac. Canadian Army staff training began at Fort Frontenac when the Canadian Army Staff College moved to the fort from the Royal Military College in 1948. The college is now known as the Canadian Army Command and Staff College. Fort Frontenac was also the location of the National Defence College until 1994.

== Archaeology ==
In 1982, archaeological investigation began at the fort. In early 1984, the City of Kingston redesigned the intersection of Ontario and Place d&#x27;Armes Streets so that the northwest bastion (Bastion St. Michel) and curtain wall could be excavated and partially reconstructed. The research also provided important details about the development and use of the fort and surrounding area, and helped to establish the relationship between the physical remains and the information included in historical maps and plans.

Intact remains of the east bastion were located in 2020 by archaeologists while preparing for infrastructure work. Deposits associated with the fur trade era were found on the south side of the bastion wall, including trade beads, beaver jaws, gun flints, and fish bones.

<doc id="1130985" wikidata="Q1369652" url="?curid=1130985" title="Estadio Tecnológico">
<text>The Estadio Tecnológico was a multi-purpose stadium located in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, located on the campus of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). It hosted football and American football games during its 67-year existence, from 1950 to 2017.

Starting 2017, the stadium was demolished. The venue was replaced by the Estadio Borregos, completed in April 2019. The new stadium can seat 10,000 people and was designed for American Football and football games.

==History==
Construction of a new stadium to house the Borregos Salvajes American football team began in August 1949. A society raised half a million pesos in 17 days in order to break ground, with Constructora Maiz Mier as the general contractor.

The stadium was formally opened on July 17, 1950 by Mexican President Miguel Alemán Valdés. Originally, it seated 20,000 spectators. In 1965, a new upper deck was added on the west side to bring the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 33,600; this expansion was celebrated with a match between C.F. Monterrey and FK Vojvodina, champions of Yugoslavia, which the locals won 2–1.

The north end zone&#x27;s &quot;horseshoe&quot; was added in 1986 to bring the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 38,000 seats for its use in the 1986 Mexico FIFA World Cup. In the early 1990s, luxury boxes were added which reduced the capacity to its current figure.

In 1991, the first tartan athletics track in Mexico was installed in the Estadio Tecnológico. The original blue track was replaced with a more traditional red color in 2002.

By the mid-2000s, with the Estadio Tecnológico being the second-oldest venue in Liga MX at the time behind Estadio Azul in Mexico City and manager Miguel Herrera declaring it &quot;obsolete&quot;, C.F. Monterrey began exploring plans for a new stadium. Administration at FEMSA, which owned the club, said that although they had presented plans to Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM) administration to add 8,000 seats by lowering the field and eliminating the athletics track, these had not been approved, and so they began planning for a new stadium at a site known as La Pastora. Additionally, the proposed expansion would have aggravated the already troublesome parking situation in the neighborhood and could have affected the view from the stadium&#x27;s suites.

In February 2014, it was announced that the stadium would be demolished after its largest tenant, C.F. Monterrey, moved to Estadio BBVA Bancomer in 2015. The stadium is to make way for an urban redevelopment project known as Distrito Tec, which will include new academic buildings for the ITESM, a new sporting complex known as the Centro Deportivo Borrego, and a new American football stadium for the Borregos Salvajes. Demolition, however, was postponed to 2017. In an event in March, the Borregos flag that had flown over the stadium was lowered to be raised again at the dedication of the new Estadio Tecnológico, planned for September 6, 2018 to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the ITESM. As part of the project, an artificial turf field will be laid down for a temporary venue in which the Borregos Salvajes will play the 2017 college football season. 

On April 29, 2017, the Estadio Tecnológico opened to the public once more for a farewell ceremony attended by more than 12,000. Two women&#x27;s soccer matches on June 10, one between the national teams of Mexico and Venezuela and a friendly between the women&#x27;s teams of Tigres and Monterrey, were the final events held in the stadium before demolition began on the 29th.

==Tenants==
===C.F. Monterrey===

From 1952 to 1973 and again from 1980 to 2015, the Estadio Tecnológico was home to one of Monterrey&#x27;s most important soccer clubs, Club de Fútbol Monterrey (known as the Rayados). The club began playing its home matches at the Estadio Tecnólogico upon its revival as a Second Division squad in 1952—the first Rayados match saw them lose 3–1 to Veracruz—and remained there until 2015, except for a period between January 1973 and September 1980 when they played at the Estadio Universitario, home to rival club Tigres UANL.

In 1977–78, with preparations for the 1977 CONCACAF Championship underway at the Estadio Universitario, both Tigres and Rayados played at the Estadio Tecnológico, including the first &quot;Clásico Regio&quot; derby held in the stadium; it would be the first of 42 meetings between the two clubs venue, with the final fixture being a 2–2 draw in October 2014.

Monterrey won league titles in 1986 (Mexico 1986) and Apertura 2010 in the venue, as well as the Copa MX in 1991 and the CONCACAF Champions League in 2012–13.

The final Monterrey soccer fixture in the Estadio Tecnológico was played on May 9, 2015, a 2–2 tie against Pumas. The club began playing at the Estadio BBVA Bancomer in time for the Apertura 2015 tournament.

===International soccer===
International soccer came to the Estadio Tecnológico on several occasions.

The 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship marked the first FIFA event at the Estadio Tecnológico. The venue hosted five games, including three group stage fixtures, a quarterfinal and a semifinal.

Three matches of the 1986 FIFA World Cup were played at the Estadio Tecnológico, pitting the England national team against Portugal, Morocco and Poland.

===Borregos Salvajes===
The Estadio Tecnológico was initially built to house the university&#x27;s American football team, which played in the Estadio Tecnológico through the 2016 season. During that time, the Borregos Salvajes won 22 national titles. On several occasions, they won the title in the Estadio Tecnológico, with the first such championship coming in 1993. The final Borregos Salvajes game in the stadium took place on November 4, 2016, when the Borregos beat the team representing the ITESM Campus México 28–0.

==1986 FIFA World Cup==


==Other events==

Estadio Tecnológico hosted the 2016 World University American Football Championship. The stadium also hosted the Fundidores de Monterrey professional American football team of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional in its 2017 season. The club&#x27;s final game of the regular season, played on April 9, 2017, was the final American football match at the venue. Additionally, track and field events were held in the stadium, such as the Galatlética 2005, which featured Ana Gabriela Guevara and Tonique Williams.

Several concerts also stopped by the Estadio Tecnológico, beginning with a visit by Bon Jovi in February 1990 for two shows on the New Jersey Syndicate Tour. On February 12, 2006, the Irish rock band U2 opened the 4th leg of its Vertigo Tour at the Estadio Tecnológico, to a crowd of 42,000. In 2010, the Black Eyed Peas played the Estadio Tecnológico in what turned out to be the final concert in the stadium.

<doc id="1130996" wikidata="Q7015325" url="?curid=1130996" title="New Zealand Democrat Party (1934)">
<text>The New Zealand Democrat Party was a political party in New Zealand, founded in 1934 with the purpose of opposing socialist legislation by the government.

==Formation==
The Democrat Party was founded and developed by Albert Davy, a prominent political organiser of the time. He had worked first for the Reform Party, then for the United Party, and finally for the Reform Party again. Davy was highly effective in both campaign management and fundraising but often came into conflict with those for whom he worked. Politically, Davy was an advocate of reducing the size of government and of minimising government intervention in the business world. The slogan &quot;More Business in Government, Less Government in Business&quot;, which was once used by the Reform Party, was thought up by Davy.

When the United Party and the Reform Party formed a coalition, Davy initially supported it but later resigned in protest at the legislation the coalition enacted to counter the Great Depression. Davy denounced the coalition as &quot;socialistic by inclination, action and fact&quot;.

In 1934, Davy was approached by William Goodfellow, a wealthy Auckland businessman and industrialist. Goodfellow strongly opposed the economic policies of the United-Reform Coalition, and was also concerned by the rise of the Labour Party. Goodfellow hoped that a small but committed party could hold the balance of power in Parliament and force the government to adopt more business-friendly policies. It was hoped by Goodfellow and his allies that Davy&#x27;s talents could create an effective organisation.

Therefore, the New Zealand Democrat Party was founded. Its primary base of support was the business community, particularly in Auckland. Before long, however, Davy and Goodfellow came into conflict. The most notable cause for dispute was the scale of Davy&#x27;s plans. Goodfellow had wanted a small party focused on winning a select few seats, but Davy was recruiting candidates as though the Democrats were a major party.

Foodfellow tried to remove Davy from the chairmanship of the Democrats in July 1935 and later initiated court proceedings to recover part of the salary Davy had been paid. Davy remained in office, however, and the Democrat Party continued on. The sitting Mayor of Wellington, Thomas Hislop, was recruited as the party&#x27;s political leader, and Davy remained its chief organiser and strategist.

==1935 election==
In the 1935 elections, Davy&#x27;s campaign was not as effective as his previous efforts. The Democrats fielded fifty-one candidates, including seven former United Party candidates and members of Parliament, including Bill Veitch and Arthur Stallworthy. However, the Democrats did not win any seats. In total, they won around 7.8% of the national vote (66,695 votes). Despite their failure to enter Parliament, their impact on the election may have been the opposite to what was intended; by splitting the anti-Labour vote, they probably contributed to Labour&#x27;s overwhelming victory in 1935.

==Dissolution==
Among the defeated Democrat candidates were Frederick Doidge and Matthew Oram, who would become future National Party MPs. Davy himself went on to found the People&#x27;s Movement and the New Zealand Co-operative Party but eventually retired from politics and returned to business. The party&#x27;s remnants amalgamated with the National Party in 1936.

<text>In baseball or softball, a pinch runner is a player substituted into a game for the purpose of base running.

==Description==
A pinch runner may be faster or otherwise more skilled at base running than the player for whom the pinch runner has been substituted. Occasionally, a pinch runner is inserted for other reasons (such as a double switch, ejection, or if the original player on base has become injured). For statistical and scorekeeping purposes, the pinch runner is denoted by PR.

As with all substitutions at most levels of baseball, when a player is pinch run for, that player is removed from the game. Some leagues, especially for youths, may allow substituted players to re-enter a game. After serving as a pinch runner, a player may remain in the game and assume a defensive position, or may be substituted for at the manager&#x27;s discretion.

==Use in Major League Baseball==
In the early history of professional baseball, the National League, which began play in 1876, changed a rule in 1878 such that pinch runners were not allowed except in cases of illness or injury, with the substitute entering the game after the original player reached base. Later rule changes allowed for pinch runners at a manager&#x27;s discretion.

A pinch runner is not credited with a game played for the purpose of consecutive-game playing streaks, per the Official Rules used by Major League Baseball (MLB). For example, in May 1984, Alfredo Griffin of the Toronto Blue Jays scored the winning run in a game, yet his consecutive game streak ended as he appeared only as a pinch runner.

One of the most famous pinch runners in major-league history was Herb Washington of the Oakland Athletics. Oakland owner Charlie Finley, known as an unconventional thinker, came to believe that it would be useful to have a &quot;designated runner&quot;—a fast player on the roster whose only job was to periodically enter a game and run the bases for slower players. He signed Washington, a track star with no baseball experience. Washington appeared in 105 games for the Athletics in 1974 and 1975, scoring 33 runs and stealing 31 bases, without once playing the field or coming up to bat. His 1975 Topps baseball card is the only baseball card known to use a &quot;Pinch Runner&quot; position label.

Outfielder Dave Roberts made a notable appearance as a pinch runner in the bottom the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, stealing a base and going on to score the tying run in a game the Boston Red Sox went on to win in 12 innings, leading to a series victory over the New York Yankees.
As of 2023, MLB was considering allowing teams to have a &quot;designated runner&quot;. The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an official MLB Partner League, tested rules for a designated runner in 2023. As described by BallparkDigest.com, the rules for a designated runner were:
===s===
Between 1877 and 1949, major-league teams occasionally used &quot;courtesy runners&quot; in addition to pinch runners. A baserunner that had to leave the game temporarily, due to injury or an equipment issue, could be replaced by a courtesy runner. The courtesy runner could be a player who had not yet appeared in the game (in which case, the courtesy runner could still be used later as a substitute) or could be a player already in the game (in which case, that player&#x27;s position in the batting order was not affected). The player who had to leave was free to rejoin the game when his team returned to the field defensively, although in some cases, an injury proved to be serious enough that he was replaced by a substitute. The last use of a courtesy runner in the major leagues was in 1949.

An example of a courtesy runner occurred in a game between the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Browns during the season, on August 31. In the second inning, Detroit right fielder Jimmy Outlaw was hit in the head by a pitch, leaving him temporarily unconscious. With permission of the St. Louis manager, Detroit first baseman Rudy York, who had made the first out of the inning, ran for Outlaw. After Detroit finished batting that half-inning, both Outlaw (who had &quot;recovered shortly&quot;) and York returned to their defensive positions and played the rest of the game.

The Official Rules used by MLB now forbid courtesy runners.

===Mid-play runners===
During major-league history, there have been a few instances of &quot;mid-play runners&quot;. This is a rare situation where the Official Rules allow an injured baserunner to be substituted, and play then resumes. Two known instances—occurring in 1977 and 2005—occurred when a baserunner entitled to score was injured such that he had to be removed from the game, and a substitute was allowed to enter the game to finish the base running and score the run. A similar instance, which occurred in 2008 but did not involve injury, occurred due to a replay review that turned an apparent single, following which the batter was replaced by a pinch runner, into a home run—the pinch runner then ran out the home run to score the run.

===Some players known primarily as pinch runners===

<text>Robert Robert Livingston, also called The Judge (August 1718 – December 9, 1775), was a prominent colonial American politician, and a leading Whig in New York in the years leading up to the American Revolution.

==Early life==
Robert R. Livingston was born in August 1718 at Clermont Manor in what was then the Province of New York, a part of British America. He was the only child of Robert Livingston (1688–1775), known as &quot;Robert of Clermont&quot; and Margaret Howarden (1693–1758). His mother was the daughter of a wealthy English merchant in New York and granddaughter of Captain Isaac Bedlow, a Huguenot after whom Bedloe&#x27;s Island is named.

His paternal grandparents were Robert Livingston the Elder (1654–1728) and Alida (née Schuyler) Van Rensselaer Livingston (1656–1727), daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628–1683) and widow of Nicholas Van Rensselaer. His uncle was Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the second Lord of Livingston Manor. His great-grandfather was Reverend John Livingston, a Church of Scotland minister who died in exile in 1673.

==Career==
Livingston, known as &#x27;Judge Livingston&#x27; to distinguish him from his eponymous father and other prominent Livingstons, was a member of the New York Provincial Assembly from 1759 to 1768. He served as judge of the admiralty court from 1760 to 1763. He was a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, and, in 1775, a member of the Committee of One Hundred, which briefly governed New York City.

From 1763 until 1775, he served as a Justice of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature.

==Family==
In 1742, he married Margaret Beekman (1724–1800), daughter of Col. Henry Beekman and Janet Livingston (his second cousin), a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman and heir to immense tracts of land in Dutchess and Ulster counties. Their children included:
* Janet Livingston (b.1743-1824), who married Gen. Richard Montgomery (1738–1775) in 1773.
* Robert R. Livingston (1746–1813), the Chancellor of New York who married Mary Stevens, daughter of John Stevens, in 1770.
* Margaret Livingston (1749–1823), who married Thomas Tillotson (1750–1832), an army surgeon who became New York Secretary of State.
* Henry Beekman Livingston (1750–1831), who commanded the 4th New York Regiment at the Battles of Saratoga and Monmouth and during the winter at Valley Forge. He married Ann Hume Shippen, daughter of Prof. Dr. William Shippen and Alice Lee of Philadelphia, in 1781.
* Catharine Livingston (1752–1849), who married Freeborn Garrettson (1752–1827) in 1791 and helped to bring Methodism to the Hudson River Valley.
* John R. Livingston (1755–1851), a merchant who took over his father&#x27;s gunpowder mill during the Revolutionary War. He married, first, to Margaret Sheafe in 1779. After her death, he married Eliza McEvers, the daughter of Charles McEvers and Mary Bache, in 1789. Eliza was the sister of his brother Edwards&#x27;s first wife Mary.
* Gertrude Livingston (1757–1833), who married Gov. Morgan Lewis (1754–1844), son of Francis Lewis (1713–1802), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.
* Joanna Livingston (1759–1827), who married Peter R. Livingston (1766–1847), acting Lieutenant Governor of New York.
* Alida Livingston (1761–1822), who married John Armstrong Jr. (1758–1843), a U.S. Senator, U.S. Secretary of War, and U.S. Minister to France who was the son of Gen. John Armstrong, Sr.
* Edward Livingston (1764–1836), a U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State who married Mary McEvers, the daughter of Charles McEvers and Mary Bache, in 1788. After her death, he married Madame Louise Moreau de Lassy in 1805. She was the sister of Auguste Davezac.

Livingston died on December 9, 1775, at his estate in Clermont, New York, several months after his own father&#x27;s death on June 27, 1775.

===Descendants===
Through his son Major John R., he was the grandfather of Robert Montgomery Livingston (1790–1838), who married Sarah Barclay Bache in 1811. Livingston and his father were known for their quarrels with Cornelius Vanderbilt and Thomas Gibbons over his operation of steamboats and the breakup of the Chancellor Livingston and Gov. Aaron Ogden monopoly resulting from the landmark Supreme Court decision in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;.

His grandson-in-law was George Croghan, a nephew of William Clark, the explorer, Lewis Livingston, Charles Edward Livingston and George Rogers Clark. His granddaughters include Margaret Lewis, Elizabeth Stevens Livingston, Margaret Maria Livingston, Julia Livingston, and Coralie Livingston.

Through Chancellor Livingston, he was the 2x great-grandfather of Mary Livingston Ludlow (1843–1919), herself the mother of his 3x great-granddaughter, Anna Hall Roosevelt (1863–1892), herself the mother of First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962).

<text>Hylidae is a wide-ranging family of frogs commonly referred to as &quot;tree frogs and their allies&quot;. However, the hylids include a diversity of frog species, many of which do not live in trees, but are terrestrial or semiaquatic.

== Taxonomy and systematics==
The earliest known fossils that can be assigned to this family are from the Cretaceous of India and the state of Wyoming in the United States.

The common name of &quot;tree frog&quot; is a popular name for several species of the family Hylidae. However, the name &quot;treefrog&quot; is not unique to this family, also being used for many species in the family Rhacophoridae.

The following genera are recognised in the family Hylidae:

* Subfamily Hylinae
** Tribe Cophomantini 
*** &quot;Aplastodiscus&quot; – canebrake treefrogs 
*** &quot;Boana&quot; – gladiator treefrogs 
*** &quot;Bokermannohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Hyloscirtus&quot;
*** &quot;Myersiohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Nesorohyla&quot;
*** &quot;&quot;Hyla&quot; nicefori&quot;
** Tribe Dendropsophini
***&quot;Dendropsophus&quot;
*** &quot;Xenohyla
** Tribe Hylini
*** &quot;Acris&quot; – cricket frogs
*** &quot;Atlantihyla&quot; 
*** &quot;Bromeliohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Charadrahyla&quot;
*** &quot;Dryophytes&quot; – Ameroasian treefrogs
*** &quot;Duellmanohyla&quot; – brook frogs
*** &quot;Ecnomiohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Exerodonta&quot;
*** &quot;Hyla&quot; – common tree frogs
*** &quot;Isthmohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Megastomatohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Plectrohyla&quot; – spike-thumb frogs
*** &quot;Pseudacris&quot; – chorus frogs
*** &quot;Ptychohyla&quot; – stream frogs
*** &quot;Quilticohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Rheohyla&quot; – small-eared treefrog
*** &quot;Sarcohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Smilisca&quot; – burrowing frogs
*** &quot;Tlalocohyla&quot;
*** &quot;Triprion&quot; – shovel-headed tree frogs
** Tribe Lophiohylini
*** &quot;Aparasphenodon&quot; – casque-headed frogs
*** &quot;Argenteohyla&quot; – Argentinian frogs
*** &quot;Corythomantis&quot; – casque-headed tree frog
*** &quot;Dryaderces&quot; 
*** &quot;Itapotihyla&quot;
*** &quot;Nyctimantis&quot; – brown-eyed tree frogs
*** &quot;Osteocephalus&quot; – slender-legged tree frogs
*** &quot;Osteopilus&quot;
*** &quot;Phyllodytes&quot; – heart-tongued frogs
*** &quot;Phytotriades&quot; – Trinidad golden treefrogs
*** &quot;Tepuihyla&quot; – Amazon tree frogs
*** &quot;Trachycephalus&quot; – casque-headed tree frog
** Tribe Pseudini
*** &quot;Lysapsus&quot; – harlequin frogs
*** &quot;Pseudis&quot; – swimming frogs
*** &quot;Scarthyla&quot; – Madre de Dios tree frogs
** Tribe Scinaxini
*** &quot;Julianus&quot;
*** &quot;Ololygon&quot; (synonymous with &quot;Scinax&quot;)
*** &quot;Scinax&quot; – snouted tree frogs
** Tribe Sphaenorhynchini
*** &quot;Sphaenorhynchus&quot; – lime tree frogs
** Incertae sedis
*** &quot;&quot;Hyla&quot; imitator&quot; – mimic tree frog
* Subfamily Pelodryadinae (Australian tree frogs)
** &quot;Litoria&quot;
** &quot;Nyctimystes&quot;
** &quot;Ranoidea&quot;
** Incertae sedis
*** &quot;&quot;Litoria&quot; &quot;castanea&quot; 
*** &quot;Litoria&quot; &quot;jeudii&quot; 
*** &quot;Litoria&quot; &quot;louisiadensis&quot; 
*** &quot;Litoria&quot; &quot;obtusirostris&quot; 
*** &quot;Litoria&quot;&quot; &quot;vagabunda&quot; 
* Subfamily Phyllomedusinae (leaf frogs)
** &quot;Agalychnis&quot;
** &quot;Callimedusa&quot;
** &quot;Cruziohyla&quot;
** &quot;Hylomantis&quot; – rough leaf frogs
** &quot;Phasmahyla&quot; – shining leaf frogs
** &quot;Phrynomedusa&quot; – colored leaf frogs
** &quot;Phyllomedusa&quot;
** &quot;Pithecopus&quot;
The subfamilies Pelodryadinae and Phyllomedusinae are sometimes classified as distinct families of their own due to their deep divergence and unique evolutionary history (with Pelodryadinae being the sister group to Phyllomedusinae and colonizing Australia during the Eocene via Antarctica, which at the time was not yet frozen over), but are presently retained in the Hylidae.

==Description==
Most hylids show adaptations suitable for an arboreal lifestyle, including forward-facing eyes providing binocular vision, and adhesive pads on the fingers and toes. In the nonarboreal species, these features may be greatly reduced, or absent.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European tree frog (&quot;Hyla arborea&quot;) is common in the middle and south of Europe, and its range extends into Asia and North Africa.

North America has many species of the family Hylidae, including the gray tree frog (&quot;Hyla versicolor&quot;) and the American green tree frog (&quot;H. cinerea&quot;). The spring peeper (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;) is also widespread in the eastern United States and is commonly heard on spring and summer evenings.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Species of the genus &quot;Cyclorana&quot; are burrowing frogs that spend much of their lives underground.

===Breeding===
Hylids lay their eggs in a range of different locations, depending on species. Many use ponds, or puddles that collect in the holes of their trees, while others use bromeliads or other water-holding plants. Other species lay their eggs on the leaves of vegetation hanging over water, allowing the tadpoles to drop into the pond when they hatch.

A few species use fast-flowing streams, attaching the eggs firmly to the substrate. The tadpoles of these species have suckers enabling them to hold on to rocks after they hatch. Another unusual adaptation is found in some South American hylids, which brood the eggs on the back of the female. The tadpoles of most hylid species have laterally placed eyes and broad tails with narrow, filamentous tips.

===Feeding===
Hylids mostly feed on insects and other invertebrates, but some larger species can feed on small vertebrates.

<doc id="1131021" wikidata="Q610159" url="?curid=1131021" title="Elektra (2005 film)">
<text>Elektra is a 2005 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Elektra Natchios and directed by Rob Bowman. It is a spin-off from the film &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), with Jennifer Garner reprising her role as the titular character. The story follows Elektra, an assassin who must protect a man and his prodigy daughter from another assassin who was hired by the Hand. Goran Višnjić, Will Yun Lee, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Terence Stamp also star.

For the screenplay, Zak Penn, Stuart Zicherman, and M. Raven Metzner received &quot;written by&quot; credit. Mark Steven Johnson received credit for &quot;motion picture characters&quot; and Frank Miller for &quot;comic book characters&quot;. Filming started in early May 2004 in Vancouver.

The film was released on January 14, 2005. Upon its release, &quot;Elektra&quot; was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $57 million against a production budget of $43–65 million. It received negative reviews from critics, who found the script and storyline lacking, but many praised Garner&#x27;s performance. She reprised her role as Elektra in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Plot==
After being killed, Elektra Natchios is revived by blind martial arts master Stick. He teaches her the ancient art of Kimagure, which provides its practitioners with precognition as well as the ability to resurrect the dead. Elektra is expelled from the training compound because of her inability to let go of her rage and fear of seeing her mother&#x27;s killer as a child. She leaves and uses her training to become a contract killer.

Years later, Elektra&#x27;s agent McCabe receives an unusually large offer from an anonymous client wishing to hire Elektra. The only stipulation: she must spend a few days in a rented home on the island where the assassination is to be performed before the names of the targets are revealed. During the wait, Elektra catches a girl named Abby trying to steal her mother&#x27;s necklace. She sends her away, and later meets and befriends her father, Mark Miller. Abby invites Elektra to Christmas dinner on Mark&#x27;s behalf. Elektra develops a romantic interest in Mark but learns that he and Abby are the targets she has been hired to kill. Elektra spares them and leaves, but returns in time to protect them from assassins sent by The Hand, a crime syndicate of ninja mercenaries.

Roshi, master of The Hand, learns of the failed attempt and permits his son Kirigi to lead a new team of assassins to kill Elektra and return with Abby, referred to as &quot;The Treasure&quot;. Elektra tries to leave Abby and Mark with Stick, but he scolds her and tells her to protect them herself. She takes Mark and Abby to McCabe&#x27;s country house, but is followed by Kirigi, Typhoid, Stone, Kinkou, and Tattoo. Elektra flees with Mark and Abby through a secret underground exit to a forest, while McCabe sacrifices himself to buy them time.

Kirigi and the assassins hunt down the trio in the forest. Elektra kills Stone, while Abby and Mark kill Kinkou with one of his own daggers. As Elektra is distracted by the revelation that Abby has martial arts skills, Typhoid gives Elektra the &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;. Abby is captured by Kirigi. Stick and his Chaste ninjas arrive, forcing Kirigi, Typhoid, and Tattoo to retreat. Stick saves Elektra from death and takes them under his protection.

Stick confirms that Abby is the &quot;Treasure&quot;, a martial arts prodigy, whom the Hand seeks to use. Elektra learns that she was a Treasure herself, resulting in her mother becoming a casualty of the fight between The Chaste and The Hand. She guesses that Stick set up the hit on Mark and Abby in order to test Elektra&#x27;s propensity for compassion.

Elektra astrally projects herself to a meeting with Kirigi and challenges him to a fight, the winner claiming Abby for their own purpose. Elektra returns to her childhood home to face Kirigi and realizes that the horned demon who killed her mother was actually Kirigi.

Elektra is defeated by Kirigi. Abby arrives and engages him long enough for Elektra to recuperate. Elektra and Abby escape and hide in a hedge maze, but Abby is captured by snakes dispatched by Tattoo. Elektra finds Tattoo and snaps his neck, releasing Abby. Elektra engages Kirigi a second time and kills him. Typhoid poisons and kills Abby, before Elektra throws her sai at Typhoid, killing her. Elektra desperately tries to wake Abby, calms herself, lets go all of her rage, and successfully resurrects her using Kimagure.

Elektra gets ready to leave. She and Mark share one final kiss. Elektra tells Abby to live a normal life and that they each gave each other&#x27;s life back. Elektra leaves, hoping that Abby will not grow up to be like her. Stick appears and points out that Elektra did not turn out so bad. Elektra bows to Stick to thank him. He bows to Elektra and disappears.

Ben Affleck reprised his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil from &quot;Daredevil&quot; in a deleted cameo appearance, where he appeared to Natchios in a dream sequence.

==Production==
In 1987, after the success of Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Marvel tried to adapt the graphic novel into a live-action movie. After selling the rights of Elektra to New Line Cinema, Frank Miller was hired to pen a screenplay based on the graphic novel of the same name. Later on, screenwriters Jim McBride and L.M. Kit Carson were hired to write a second script. Director Oliver Stone later signed on to direct and wanted volleyball player, model, and actress Gabrielle Reece to star as Elektra. The project was cancelled after the rights to Elektra were sold to 20th Century Fox.

Garner reportedly did not want to do the film and only did it because she was legally required due to contractual obligations from &quot;Daredevil&quot;. The film was made during Garner&#x27;s hiatus from the television show &quot;Alias&quot;, and production was limited by that timeframe. Ben Affleck reprised his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil in a cameo appearance, but it was cut from the final film. The scene was included on the DVD as a deleted scene.

Director Rob Bowman knew going into the project that the production time was going to be short and they would be limited in what they could achieve, but thought that critics would appreciate what he was able to do with the relatively small $43 million budget. Bowman saw it not as an all action spectacle but as &quot;a story about a character learning about compassion&quot;. He said shooting and preparation made for very long days, and as little as four hours sleep a night, and that he used &quot;every trick in the book I had to pull that movie off in that short amount of time.&quot;
Bowman stated that the film was &quot;literally 12 frames of film from an R-rating&quot; due to MPAA objections to several death scenes.

==Music==
Elektra: The Album was released in 2005 by Wind-up Records. As with many Wind-up soundtracks, almost none of the songs featured on the album were actually used in the film except for &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, &quot;Wonder&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;, and &quot;Thousand Mile Wish (Elektra Mix)&quot; with the latter three being featured during the end credits. An Ali Dee remix of Submersed&#x27;s &quot;Hollow&quot; also appeared in the film, but the song&#x27;s original version appears on the soundtrack; The Ali Dee remix remains unreleased. The album contained several songs by artists on the Wind-Up roster that originally appeared in their respective previous albums, but aside from &quot;Never There (She Stabs)&quot;, &quot;Hey Kids&quot;, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, &quot;Breathe No More&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;, &amp; the original version of &quot;Hollow&quot;, all other songs featured were either created specifically for it, or debuted here before being included in the artists&#x27; later albums. A score album was released by Varèse Sarabande containing selections of Christophe Beck&#x27;s original music from the film.

==Release==
===Home media===
The DVD of &quot;Elektra&quot; was released on April 5, 2005. It featured several deleted scenes, including one featuring Ben Affleck reprising his role from &quot;Elektra&quot;″s predecessor, &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003). It was released on VHS in May 2005.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
An extended and slightly refined two-disc unrated director&#x27;s cut DVD was released in October 2005, featuring a cut detailed for home video release. Unlike the &quot;Daredevil&quot; director&#x27;s cut which added about thirty minutes of material not in the original theatrical release, this version only changed about seven minutes of footage, extending the total runtime by just three minutes. It was also criticized for poor video transfer.

A Blu-ray of &quot;Elektra&quot; was released on October 19, 2009, for release in the United Kingdom and France. The US version was released on May 4, 2010. It contains only the unrated director&#x27;s cut of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Elektra&quot; opened on January 14, 2005, in the United States in 3,204 theatres. In its opening weekend, it ranked fifth, taking $12,804,793. In its second weekend, it took $3,964,598, a drop of 69%. Domestically the total gross was $24,409,722, at the time the lowest for a film featuring a Marvel Comics character since &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. The film had a worldwide total of $56,681,566.

===Critical response===
The film received largely negative reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of , based on reviews with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Jennifer Garner inhabits her role with earnest gusto, but &quot;Elektra&quot; tone-deaf script is too self-serious and bereft of intelligent dialogue to provide engaging thrills.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 1.5 out of 4, and wrote: &quot;Plays like a collision between leftover bits and pieces of Marvel superhero stories. It can&#x27;t decide what tone to strike.&quot; Helen O&#x27;Hara at &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, and says &quot;Despite oozing star quality, Garner struggles to rise above the limitations of the script.&quot; Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; writes: &quot;&quot;Elektra&quot; proves no more than fitfully satisfying, a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; writes &quot;[Garner&#x27;s] grace and mystical abilities make for a lonely burden, and we are supposed to feel her pain. Instead, we feel our own for having to sit through this silly movie.&quot; Puig concluded that Garner &quot;is far more appealing when she&#x27;s playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;. Paul Byrnes of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; explained that &quot;if the film isn&#x27;t as bad as some others in the comics-to-cinema genre (Halle Berry&#x27;s &quot;Catwoman&quot; has rather lowered the bar), that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s good.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; writes: &quot;This doesn&#x27;t exactly set the world on fire, but I was charmed by its old-fashioned storytelling, which is refreshingly free of archness, self-consciousness, or &quot;Kill Bill&quot;-style wisecracks.&quot;

Director Rob Bowman was somewhat surprised by the negative reviews, he accepted the difficulty of making something with mass market appeal &quot;Everybody likes ice cream, but not everybody likes chocolate ice cream&quot; but acknowledged the film&#x27;s shortcomings and said &quot;if you can&#x27;t handle people not liking what you do, you shouldn&#x27;t be in the business&quot;.

===Accolades===
Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe were nominated for Best Kiss at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. Garner was nominated in the category Choice Movie Actress: Action Adventure/Thriller at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards.

==Legacy==
Film critic Scott Mendelson blamed the film for ruining Jennifer Garner&#x27;s career, and said it killed off the notion of a female lead superhero movie for a decade. In March 2005, producer Avi Arad told investors that Marvel had made a mistake rushing &quot;Elektra&quot; into release. &quot;We will never do that again,&quot; he said. In an email released because of the Sony Pictures hack, Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter cited &quot;Elektra&quot; as an example of an unprofitable female led superhero film. He wrote: &quot;Very bad idea and the end result was very, very bad.&quot;

In 2016, Katharine Trendacosta at io9 reviewed the film and called it &quot;somehow so much worse than you remember&quot; and said that the version of Elektra in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; could only be an improvement.

=== Marvel Cinematic Universe ===
Elektra appears in the Marvel&#x27;s Netflix television series &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;The Defenders,&quot; portrayed by Élodie Yung. Jennifer Garner&#x27;s Elektra appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024).

==Video game==
&quot;Elektra&quot; was supposed to have a video game based on the movie with support from the comics. The game was never released, as publishers felt it would not be popular enough. A game based on the film was released for mobile.

<doc id="1131022" wikidata="Q22328947" url="?curid=1131022" title="Apoplast">
<text>The &quot;apoplast &quot; is the extracellular space outside of plant cell membranes, especially the fluid-filled cell walls of adjacent cells where water and dissolved material can flow and diffuse freely. Fluid and material flows occurring in any extracellular space are called &quot;apoplastic&quot; flow or apoplastic transport. The apoplastic pathway is one route by which water and solutes are transported and distributed to different places through tissues and organs, contrasting with the symplastic pathway.

To prevent uncontrolled leakage to unwanted places, in certain areas there are barriers to the apoplastic flow: 
in roots the Casparian strip has this function 
Outside the plant epidermis of aerial plant parts is a protective waxy film called plant cuticle that protects against drying out, but also waterproofs the plant against external water.

The apoplast is important for all the plant&#x27;s interaction with its environment: 
The main carbon source (carbon dioxide) needs to be solubilized, which happens in the apoplast, before it diffuses through the cell wall and across the &quot;plasma membrane&quot;, into the cell&#x27;s inner content, the cytoplasm, where it diffuses in the symplast to the chloroplasts for photosynthesis. 
In the roots, ions diffuse into the apoplast of the epidermis before diffusing into the symplast, or in some cases being taken up by specific ion channels, and being pulled by the plant&#x27;s transpiration stream, which also occurs completely within the boundaries of the apoplast. Similarly, all gaseous molecules emitted and received by plants such as oxygen must pass through the apoplast. 
In nitrate poor soils, acidification of the apoplast increases cell wall extensibility and root growth rate. This is believed to be caused by a decrease in nitrate uptake (due to deficit in the soil medium) and supplanted with an increase in chloride uptake. H+ATPase increases the efflux of H+, thus acidifying the apoplast.
 
The apoplast is a site for cell-to-cell communication. During local oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions can diffuse through the apoplast and transport a warning signal to neighbouring cells. In addition, a local alkalinization of the apoplast due to such stress can travel within minutes to the rest of the plant body via the xylem and trigger systemic acquired resistance. 
The apoplast also plays an important role in resistance to aluminium toxicity.
In addition to resistance to chemicals, the apoplast provides the rich environment for microorganisms endophytes which arises[??] the abiotic resistance of plants.
 Exclusion of aluminium ions in the apoplast prevent toxic levels which inhibit shoot growth, reducing[?] crop yields.

==History==
The term apoplast was coined in 1930 by Münch in order to separate the &quot;living&quot; symplast from the &quot;dead&quot; apoplast.

==Apoplastic transport==
The apoplastic pathway is one of the two main pathways for water transport in plants, the other being symplastic pathway. 
In the root via the apoplast water and minerals flow in an upward direction to the xylem. 
The concentration of solutes transported through the apoplast in aboveground organs is established through a combination of import from the xylem, absorption by cells, and export by the phloem. 
Transport velocity is higher (transport is faster) in the apoplast than in the symplast. 
This method of transport also accounts for a higher proportion of water transport in plant tissues than does symplastic transport. 
The apoplastic pathway is also involved in passive exclusion. Some of the ions that enter through the roots do not make it to the xylem. The ions are excluded by the cell walls (&quot;plasma membranes&quot;) of the endodermal cells.

== Apoplastic colonization ==
It is well known that the apoplast is rich in nutrients, and microorganisms accordingly thrive there. There is an apoplastic immune system, but pathogens with effectors can modulate or suppress the host’s immune responses. This is known as effector-triggered susceptibility. Another factor in pathogens’ frequent colonization of the apoplast is that when they enter from the leaves, the apoplast is the first thing they come across. Therefore, the apoplast is a popular biotic interface and also a reservoir for microbes. One common apoplastic disease appearing in plants without restricted habitat or climate is black rot, caused by the gram-negative bacteria &quot;Xanthomonas campestris.&quot;

Entophytic bacteria can cause severe problems in agriculture by alkalizing the apoplast with their volatiles and therefore inhibiting plant growth. In particular, the largest phytoyoxic component of the volatiles of rhizobacteria has been identified as 2-phenylethanol. 2-phenylethanol can influence the regulation of WRKY18, a transcription factor engaged in multiple plant hormones, one of which is abscisic acid (ABA) hormone. 2-phyenlethanol modulates the sensitivity of ABA through WRKY18 and WRKY40, but WRKY18 is the central mediator of the pathway of triggering cell death and modulation of ABA sensitivity influenced by 2-phyenlethanol. Therefore, it results in the inhibition of root growth, and the plants have no capacity to grow without having the roots absorb nutrients in soils.

However, the microbial colonization in the apoplast is not always harmful to the plants, indeed, it can be beneficial to establish a symbiotic relationship with the host. One of the examples is the endophytic and phyllosphere microbes can indirectly promote plant growth and protect the plant from other pathogens by inducing salicylic acid (SA)and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways, and they are both parts of the pathogen associated molecular patterns triggered immunity (PTI). The productions of SA and JA hormones also modulate the ABA signaling to be the components on the defense gene expression, and there are a lot more responses with the involvement of other hormones to respond to different biotic and abiotic stress. In the experiment performed by Romero et al., they inoculated the known entophytic bacteria, &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; into Canola, a plant that grows in multiple habitats, and it is found its apoplastic fluids that are 99% identity to another bacteria, &quot;Pseudomonas viridiflava,&quot; by performing 16S rRNA sequences with the Genebank and reference strains. They further used the markers on the SA-responsive transcriptional factor and other specific genes such as lipoxygenase 3 as marker genes for JA signaling and ABA signaling to perform quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. It has shown &quot;Xanthomonas&quot; only activates the related gene of SA pathway, in comparison, &quot;Pseudomonas viridiflava&quot; is able to trigger the genes of both SA and JA pathway, which suggest &quot;Pseudomonas viridiflava&quot; originally in Canola can stimulate PTI by the accumulation of both signaling pathway to inhibit the growth of &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;&quot;.&quot; In conclusion, the apoplast acts as a crucial role in plants, involving in all kinds of regulations of hormone and transportation of nutrients, so once it has been colonized, the effect it brings cannot be neglected.

==Notes==
#Apoplast was previously defined as &quot;everything but the symplast, consisting of cell walls and spaces between cells in which water and solutes can move freely&quot;. However, since solutes can neither freely move through the air spaces between plant cells nor through the cuticle, this definition has been changed. When referring to &quot;everything outside the plasma membrane&quot;, the term &quot;extracellular space&quot; is in use.
#The word apoplasm is also in use with similar meaning as apoplast, although less common.

<text>The symplast of a plant is the region enclosed by the cell membranes, within which water and solutes can diffuse freely. 
By contrast the apoplast is any fluid-filled space within the cell wall and extracellular space. Neighbouring cells are interconnected by microscopic channels known as plasmodesmata that traverse the cell walls. These channels, allow the flow of small molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and ions between cells (from the inner part of one cell to the inner part of the next cell). Larger molecules, including transcription factors and plant viruses, can also be transported through with the help of actin structures. The symplast allows direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm flow of water and other nutrients along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow is used in the root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. Nutrient solutes move in this way through three skin layers of the roots: from cells of the &quot;epidermis&quot;, the outermost layer, through the &quot;cortex&quot; into the &quot;endodermis&quot;. 

Once solutes in the soil water reach the endodermal cells through apoplastic flow, they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the Casparian strip. Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the pericycle, where they can be moved into the xylem for long-distance transport.

==History==
Symplastic transport was first realized by Eduard Tangl in 1879, who also discovered plasmodesmata, a term coined by Eduard Strasburger, 1901. In 1880, Hanstein coined the term symplast. The contrasting terms apoplast and symplast were used together in 1930 by Münch.

<text>Peter Van Brugh Livingston (bp. November 3, 1710 Albany, New York – December 28, 1792 Elizabethtown, Union County, New Jersey) was a Patriot during the American Revolution who was a wealthy merchant and who served as the 1st New York State Treasurer from 1776 to 1778.

==Early life==
Peter Van Brugh Livingston was the second surviving son of Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor, and Catharine Van Brugh (b. 1689). His older brother was Robert Livingston (1708–1790) and his younger brothers included Philip Livingston (1716–1778), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and William Livingston (1723–1790), a signer of the United States Constitution and the 1st Governor of New Jersey. Livingston graduated from Yale College in 1731, and settled in New York City.

Livingston&#x27;s mother was the only child of his namesake, Pieter Van Brugh (1666–1740), the Mayor of Albany, New York from 1699 to 1700 and from 1721 to 1723. His grandfather&#x27;s sister, Catharina Van Brugh, married Hendrick van Rensselaer, the son of Jeremias van Rensselaer, patroon of Rensselaerswyck. Livingston&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Johannes Pieterse van Brugh (1624–1697), was one of the early settlers of New Netherland and was prominently connected with the Dutch West India Company.

His paternal grandparents were Alida Schuyler (1656–1727) and Robert Livingston the Elder (1654–1728), and his uncle was Robert Livingston (1688–1775) of Clermont.

==Career==
After his graduation from Yale, he became engaged in the shipping business with William Alexander, Lord Stirling. He was also engaged in the slave trade with his father. Livingston&#x27;s mercantile interests involved activities in the West Indies, North Carolina, and Fort Niagara, where he was involved in the fur trade.

In 1748, he helped found the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and became one of its original trustees, serving until 1761. In 1755, he furnished the supplies for the expedition of Governor William Shirley to Acadia.

In 1775, he was a member of the Committee of One Hundred. He was a delegate to the New York Provincial Congresses, and was President from May 1775 to August 1775 and from September 1776 to March 1777. He was also Chairman of the Committee of Safety from September 1776 to March 1777. In 1776, he was appointed Treasurer by the Provincial Congress, and remained in office until 1778, after the establishment of the State Government.

==Personal life==
His home in New York City was a large mansion on the east side of what is now Hanover Square, with grounds extending to the East River. Later he removed to Elizabethtown, N.J., and died there at the Liberty Hall.

On November 3, 1739, Peter Van Brugh Livingston married Mary Alexander (1721–1767), the daughter of James Alexander and Mary Spratt Provoost, and the sister of his business associate, Lord Stirling. Before her death in 1767, they had twelve children, including:

* Philip Peter Livingston (1740–1810), who was known as &quot;Gentleman Phil,&quot; and who married Cornelia Van Horne (b. 1759).
* Mary Livingston (1742), who died in infancy.
* Catherine Livingston (1743–1775), who married Nicholas Bayard.
* James Alexander Livingston (b. 1744).
* Mary Livingston (1746–1780), who married Capt. John Brown.
* Peter Livingston (b. 1753), who married Susan Blondel.
* Sarah Livingston (1755–1825), who married Capt. James Ricketts.
* William Alexander Livingston (1757–1780), who was killed in a duel.
* Susan Livingston (1759–1853), who married (1) John Kean in 1789; (2) Count Julian Niemcewicz in 1800, aide to Kosciuzko.
* Elizabeth Livingston (1761–1787), who married French consul Louis-Guillaume Otto.
* James Alexander Livingston (b. 1763), who died young.
* Ann Livingston (b. 1767), who died young.

On April 9, 1771, he married Elizabeth Ricketts, the widow of William Ricketts, in Elizabethtown, New Jersey.

===Descendants and honors===
Through his eldest son Philip, he was the grandfather of Van Brugh Livingston (1792–1868), who served as the American Chargé d&#x27;affaires (i.e. equivalent of the current U.S. Ambassador) to Ecuador from August 12, 1848 until November 12, 1849, appointed by President James K. Polk.

Livingston&#x27;s daughter Susan Niemcewicz established a scholarship at the College of New Jersey, named in honor of her father.

<doc id="1131027" wikidata="Q1651218" url="?curid=1131027" title="Nanniwan">
<text>&quot;Nanniwan&quot; is a revolutionary song written in 1943 with lyrics by communist playwright and poet He Jingzhi and music by Ma Ke. It was made popular by the Chinese Communist Party and continues to be one of the most recognisable songs in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Nanniwan is a gorge about 90 km southeast of Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi province. In response to economic blockades by the Imperial Japanese Army and Kuomintang in 1941, the Communists set up crops production committee with Ren Bishi as its head and began experimenting with small scale agricultural development as well as poppy production in a bid to become self-sufficient. The 359th brigade of the Eighth Route Army was deployed to Nanniwan to improve productivity. In 1943 Nanniwan was heralded a success, and a propagandist song was commissioned. The lyrics, written by He Jingzhi, were set to a traditional folk melody of northern Shaanxi.

The song rose during the last years of the Second Sino-Japanese War and continued to be popular after the Communist victory in 1949. It is the signature song of the important revolutionary singer Wang Kun, and Cui Jian, widely regarded as the &quot;father of Chinese rock,&quot; created a rock version of the song in 1987. It experienced a revival during the mid-1990s along with other revolutionary songs, with the release of many re-adaptations in Guoyue compilations. In the late 20th century Nan Ni Wan was also remade into a Chinese popular Lunar New Year song entitled &quot;Cai Yuan Gun Gun&quot; (), sung by Cindy Wong () and Zheng Yi () – Malaysian Chinese singers.

== Cui Jian performance controversy ==
Cui Jian was invited to perform for an annual official TV gala in 1987 where he sang a version of the song that was distinctly different. His version removed the final stanza that hails the achievements of the 359th Brigade, changing the tone of the song to sound more like a lament. The commander of the 359th Brigade, Wang Zhen, took offense and the performance cost Cui his job – he was banned from performing and forced to perform underground. Undeterred, Cui continued to perform Nanniwan at nearly every major performance of his following the ban.

== Lyrics ==
* This lyric, referring to Nanniwan as &quot;Jiangnan&quot;, implies it is as prosperous as the extremely fertile area immediately south of the Yangtze.

<text>The Estadio Universitario (&quot;University Stadium&quot;), nicknamed El Volcán (&quot;Spanish&quot; for &quot;The Volcano&quot;), is a football stadium located on the campus of the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León in San Nicolás de los Garza, Nuevo León, Mexico, in the metropolitan area of Monterrey.

==History==
===Construction===
Construction cost $23 million MXN when the stadium was completed in 1967. The official dedication occurred on May 30 of that year. Originally planned to hold nearly 90,000 spectators, the plan was downscaled to meet financial needs. After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, the stadium&#x27;s official capacity was 52,000. Later, modifications were made to improve the fan experience and increase safety, resulting in a reduced capacity; the stadium currently seats 41,615.

===Potential renovations===
In 2016, a proposal was floated to build a replacement venue for Tigres that would sit atop the Santa Catarina River running through central Monterrey. The proposed stadium would have seated 80,000. The National Water Commission, CONAGUA, rejected the project as potentially affecting the flow of the river (the dry riverbed was infamously developed with parks and parking facilities that were swept away in 2010&#x27;s Hurricane Alex).

==Sports==
===Football===
The stadium is the home venue for the Tigres UANL, playing in the Liga MX. It was given to Sinergia Deportiva, the for-profit company that administers Tigres, as part of the club&#x27;s assets.

The stadium hosted several matches of the 1986 FIFA World Cup. It also hosted Copa Libertadores de América matches in 2005 and 2006, when Tigres qualified for the prestigious tournament. For a short period, it was also the home venue for C.F. Monterrey. It also hosted several matches of the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup.

Between 1973 and 1980, C.F. Monterrey, the other top-flight soccer club in Monterrey, also used the Estadio Universitario. The club departed to return to the Estadio Tecnológico beginning in September 1980.

===American football===

While the Auténticos Tigres, the university&#x27;s American football team, have their own stadium (the Estadio Gaspar Mass), the Estadio Universitario is normally used for playoff games and ONEFA championships. One exception was the 2016 ONEFA championship game, played at Gaspar Mass due to a playoff soccer game scheduled for the next day.

On August 5, 1996, the stadium hosted the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys in the American Bowl, with the Chiefs winning by a score of 32-6. The event recorded 52,247 paid tickets.

==Concerts==
British rock band Queen performed during The Game Tour on October 9, 1981, to more than 150,000 fans on their first and only tour of Mexico.

Artists and bands such as Rod Stewart, Guns N&#x27; Roses, The Rolling Stones, Iron Maiden, Johnny Gill, The Cure, Coldplay, Bruno Mars, Shakira, Aerosmith and Metallica have performed at the stadium.

==1986 FIFA World Cup==

In the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico, the stadium hosted 4 matches:
==2022 CONCACAF W Championship==

The 2022 CONCACAF W Championship held in Mexico, the stadium hosted 8 matches:

<doc id="1131044" wikidata="Q607245" url="?curid=1131044" title="Recognition of same-sex unions in Romania">
<text>Romania does not allow same-sex marriage or civil unions. Registered partnerships have been debated in the Parliament of Romania several times since 2008, though no bill on the matter has successfully passed. In May 2023, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Romania was violating the European Convention on Human Rights by not recognizing same-sex unions. The government appealed the decision to the Grand Chamber in August 2023, but this appeal was rejected on 25 September 2023. Romania is now legally obliged to provide legal recognition to same-sex couples, and may risk financial sanctions from the Council of Europe if it fails to change the law.

In June 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that under certain circumstances same-sex spouses of European Union citizens should be granted a right of residency in Romania. The Constitution of Romania does not define marriage directly, but Article 48 of the Constitution defines marriages between &quot;spouses&quot; as the foundation of the family.

==Health-related rights==
In June 2019, the Chamber of Deputies voted in favour of amending patient rights legislation, allowing patients to designate any person over 18 years of age as their &quot;legal representative&quot; through a statutory declaration. This allows a person in a same-sex relationships to visit their partner in hospital and to make medical decisions on their behalf. The initiator of the law specifically referred to the fact that about 10% of Romanian couples at the time were unmarried as one of the reasons for the reform. The law was promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis on 24 July 2019 and came into effect on 28 July 2019. While the law does not specifically mention same-sex couples, it provides a mechanism for same-sex couples to obtain equal visitation and medical decision-making rights to different-sex married couples, by appointing themselves as a &quot;legal representative&quot; through a public notary.

==Registered partnerships==
Registered partnerships (, ) are not available in Romania, despite several previous unsuccessful attempts to change the law. The first bill to recognise registered partnerships was introduced in 2008. In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling obliging Romania to legally recognize same-sex unions, otherwise risking financial sanctions from the Council of Europe.

The primary LGBT advocacy group in Romania is ACCEPT, which advocates for partnership rights and same-sex marriage. The organisation launched a campaign to legalise same-sex registered partnerships in Romania during Bucharest Pride in 2006, which lasted from 30 May to 4 June, and was organised under the theme &quot;Same-sex marriage and civil unions in Romania&quot;. This event provoked widespread debate over the issue in the media. ACCEPT activists organised a public debate and seminar on same-sex partnerships on 31 May 2006, and called on the Government of Romania to legalise same-sex marriage or registered partnerships, offering its assistance in drafting a legislative proposal. Romaniţa Iordache, the executive director of ACCEPT, said on 31 May 2006 that &quot;Article 200 [the last anti-gay law] has been abrogated, but we [the LGBT community] still do not have equal rights, even though the Constitution guarantees this.&quot; A spokesman for ACCEPT, Florin Buhuceanu, claimed that &quot;guaranteeing the equality of rights through the recognition of gay marriage... is just a step forward.&quot;

===Early bills===
On 23 February 2008, Péter Eckstein-Kovács, a parliamentarian from the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, proposed a bill to legalise registered partnerships, providing unmarried same-sex and opposite-sex couples a number of legal rights and benefits. He said that the current Family Code was &quot;adopted more than fifty years ago and no longer reflected social realities, both in the case of homosexuals and heterosexuals&quot;. This marked the first time in Romania that a politician had explicitly supported registered partnerships for same-sex couples. The bill failed to pass. Eckstein-Kovács re-introduced a partnership bill on 23 July 2008. However, that bill died in the Senate following the 2008 election.

A registered partnership bill was introduced by Viorel Arion from the Democratic Liberal Party in February 2011. It would have provided same-sex and opposite-sex couples with some of the rights of marriage. It received a favourable recommendation from the Legislative Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. However, the bill was opposed by the government, and ultimately failed to pass.

In April 2013, MP Remus Cernea from the Green Party announced he would introduce a bill to grant same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples, prompting fierce reactions from opponents of the move. Among the most vehement reactions was from Senator Puiu Hașotti, who described homosexuals as &quot;sick people&quot; and &quot;not natural&quot;, prompting a formal complaint by the organization ACCEPT to the National Council for Combating Discrimination. On 4 July 2013, Cernea introduced the bill to the Senate. A few months later, the Romanian Government issued a statement confirming it would not support the bill, and on 17 December 2013 the bill was rejected by the Senate by 110 votes to 2. On 13 March 2014, a judicial committee unanimously advised the Parliament to reject the proposal. On 11 June 2014, the bill was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies with 298 votes opposed to the bill, 4 in favor and 5 abstentions. On 31 March 2015, another civil union bill was rejected by the Senate with 49 votes against the bill, 8 in favor and 3 abstentions.

===Reform attempts in 2018–2019===
In April 2018, Liviu Dragnea, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, expressed his support for registered partnerships. On 9 October 2018, just days after the failed referendum to ban same-sex marriage in the Romanian Constitution, the Minister for European Affairs, Victor Negrescu, said that a bill allowing registered partnerships had been finalized and would be introduced in mid-October. However, in mid-October 2018, some media reported that the introduction of the bill had been postponed, and that the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Dragnea himself were no longer supportive. On 29 October, the Senate rejected a partnership bill introduced by Oana Bîzgan, an independent. On 31 October, a group of 42 deputies from different parties submitted another bill to the Chamber of Deputies.

Two separate civil union bills were rejected by the Senate in March 2019. One bill would have recognised same-sex and opposite-sex couples &quot;for the purpose of setting up a shared private life and household&quot;, while the other bill would have granted shared rights for couples entering a partnership and covered aspects such as succession rights, protection from domestic violence, the obligation to support an incapacitated partner, and fiscal facilities or social benefits granted by the state.

===&quot;Buhuceanu&quot; ruling and aftermath===
On 23 May 2023, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in &quot;Buhuceanu and Others v. Romania&quot; that the Romanian Government had violated the human rights of 21 same-sex couples by refusing to recognise their relationships. The lead plaintiff was Florin Buhuceanu, the former executive director of ACCEPT. The couples had sued in 2019 and 2020 for being &quot;deprived of their dignity as spouses&quot;, and cited disadvantages, such as being barred from spousal bereavement leave, mortgage programmes or joint health insurance. The ECHR ruled that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights requires the government to recognise same-sex unions. The government was given three months to appeal the decision, but if the appeal was rejected, Romania would be required to pass legislation recognising same-sex unions, otherwise risking sanctions from the Council of Europe. Reacting to the decision, President Klaus Iohannis said the topic was &quot;a complicated issue for Romania&quot;. Members of the Orthodox Church and the Alliance for the Union of Romanians called for the decision to be &quot;ignored&quot;, which is legally impossible.

The government announced its intention to appeal the decision in August 2023. According to Csaba Ferenc Asztalos, such an appeal was unlikely to succeed, as the ECHR had already ruled in the case of &quot;Fedotova and Others v. Russia&quot; in January 2023 on the same issue being appealed by the government. The ECHR later also issued similar rulings with respect to Ukraine in &quot;Maymulakhin and Markiv&quot;, Bulgaria in &quot;Koilova and Babulkova&quot; and Poland in &quot;Przybyszewska and Others&quot;. If the appeal was rejected, the decision would become mandatory for all 46 members of the Council of Europe. 

The appeal was rejected by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on 25 September 2023, making &quot;Buhuceanu&quot; final and definitive. Romania is now legally obliged to recognize same-sex unions. If the government fails to change the law and the Council of Europe launches infringement procedures, the financial sanctions faced by Romania could amount to between €1,830 and €109,800 for each day of delay (9,102 RON to 546,145 RON), as well as a minimum lump sum of €1,708,000 (8,495,592 RON). Lucian Romașcanu, a spokesman for the ruling Social Democratic Party, said in a statement that &quot;the European Court&#x27;s final ruling on the protection and legal recognition of LGBT families in Romania must be thoroughly analysed by the government and explained to society. Romania is committed to fulfilling its obligations as an EU member state&quot;, but also said there were &quot;significant cultural differences&quot; between Romania and the rest of the European Union. In November 2023, when asked whether the government intended to enforce the ruling, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu issued a statement that &quot;Romanian society is not ready for a decision at the moment. It is not one of my priorities and… I don&#x27;t think Romania is ready.&quot; The situation remained unchanged in November 2024; Buhuceanu said, &quot;This issue cannot be separated from what&#x27;s going on with the democracy status of Romania. It&#x27;s inconceivable to have final judgments that are not respected immediately.&quot;

==Same-sex marriage==
===Background===
While running for president in 2004, Traian Băsescu said that he saw &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with same-sex marriage. The opposition Social Democratic Party later used his comments against him during the presidential campaign. Băsescu would serve as president from 2004 to 2014.

On 13 February 2008, the Senate voted in favour of an amendment to the Civil Code of Romania, proposed by the Greater Romania Party, to explicitly define marriage as being only between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;. Previously, the law had only used the words &quot;between spouses&quot;. The amendment was approved with 38 votes for, 10 votes against and 19 senators abstaining. It was not voted on by the Chamber of Deputies, and as new elections took place at the end of that year, the legislation died. In May 2009, a new civil code was proposed by the government. The parliamentary subcommittee responsible for drafting the Civil Code amended the definition of marriage, explicitly stating that it must be &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;. An amendment was also passed stating that the Romanian state would not recognise foreign same-sex marriages. Article 259(1) of the Civil Code states that marriage is &quot;the freely consented union between one man and one woman&quot;. In addition, article 277(1) of the code emphasizes that &quot;marriage shall be prohibited between persons of the same sex&quot;.

A lesbian couple was able to marry at Bucharest City Hall in September 2022 because one of the spouses was transgender and had not completed a legal gender change.

===Political viewpoints===
With the exceptions of the Save Romania Union and the Green Party, none of Romania&#x27;s major political parties, either in government or in opposition, explicitly support same-sex marriage or registered partnerships, or have proposed any law regarding it, resulting in the debate about this issue in the political sphere being more reserved than in civil society and the media.

On 6 June 2006, the &quot;Cotidianul&quot; newspaper conducted interviews with representatives of the five main political parties, asking them about their stance on same-sex marriage. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the parliamentary delegation of the National Liberal Party, part of the governing coalition, declined to give an official party view on the matter. Instead, he said that &quot;both the party and myself have given proof that we are in favour of recognising sexual minorities. However, personally I am against marriage between people of the same sex.&quot; The leader of the Democratic Party, also part of the governing coalition, was similarly elusive, stating that: &quot;Now is not the right moment to talk about this issue [same-sex marriage]. We now have other much more important things to do regarding European integration. Let&#x27;s integrate firstly, and then we can see the way in which mentalities change. Eventually, we will discuss this issue then.&quot; Romania&#x27;s EU accession took place in January 2007. Mayor Liviu Negoiţă of Sector 3 in Bucharest said that &quot;if a law will exist [legalising same-sex marriage], I will respect it. As a mayor, I don&#x27;t have any other choice. Personally, I respect the sexual choice of each person&quot;. The largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose stance on social issues is usually more conservative than that of the then-governing parties, stated that they would &quot;not initiate and would not support such a legislative proposal&quot;. However, the party&#x27;s official spokesperson also proclaimed that, &quot;a public debate [on same-sex marriage] is necessary, in order to see in what way the standards regarding fundamental liberties can be improved in regard to people with another sexual orientation&quot;.

Opposition was seen most clearly from the far-right, nationalist Greater Romania Party. The vice-president of the party stated that &quot;clearly, we wouldn&#x27;t initiate such a legislative proposal, since we&#x27;re a Christian party. The sin of sodomy is one of the biggest [sins].&quot; The Conservative Party was less vocal in its opposition to same-sex marriage, with Octavian Petrovici, the vice-president of the party&#x27;s Bucharest division, stating about same-sex couples that &quot;it&#x27;s their own choice, and in the same way that we respect the option of every citizen, we respect the choice of these people. However, it is a long way from respecting a choice to making special laws, which do not match the values and principles that our party affirms.&quot; On 27 November 2006, the women&#x27;s wing of the Conservative Party adopted a resolution opposing same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. The resolution declared that &quot;the family has as its primary aim our continuity and we will continue to support its development, particularly since we will be confronted in the future with an accentuated process of aging and a significant reduction in the population. We reject categorically the legalisation of same-sex marriage.&quot; On 10 June 2007, after Bucharest Pride, the Conservative Party reiterated its position on same-sex marriage, stating: &quot;The sexual options of each citizen are accepted and respected in Romania, but from here until the adoption of special laws for sexual minorities is too long a way. We support the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman.&quot;

===Attempts to pass constitutional ban===
Article 48 of the Constitution of Romania states:
Amending the Romanian Constitution requires approval by the people through a referendum. Until 2014, referendums required a 50% voter turnout to be valid, but changes to electoral law subsequently reduced this to 30%.

====June 2013 attempts====
On 5 June 2013, a parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the Constitution voted to include sexual orientation as a protected ground against discrimination. The same committee voted, the following day, to change the text on marriage from &quot;the family is founded on the freely consented marriage of the spouses&quot; to &quot;the family is founded on the freely consented marriage between a man and a woman alone&quot;, thus banning same-sex marriage. Green MP Remus Cernea described the move to ban same-sex marriage as &quot;clearly a democratic setback; Romania should now be included among the most homophobic countries in the world.&quot; Many NGOs opposed the move to ban same-sex marriage and released a common statement arguing that the provision prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation should remain in the Constitution. Florin Buhuceanu, the executive director of ACCEPT, said: &quot;We see the scale of schizophrenia: one day you accept sexual orientation as a constitutional protected ground [against discrimination], the next day you act discriminately on the basis of sexual orientation proposing a different treatment for these citizens of Romania of this sexual orientation.&quot; Csaba Ferenc Asztalos, the president of the National Council for Combating Discrimination, thought that the new amendments &quot;are brought to the table just to manipulate, just to incite, just to serve other goals then a real problem (...) [and] that at this point we are channeling the societal hatred through acts like the Constitution only, for example, to have [political] quorum (...) and this is not normal&quot;.

Faced with backlash from civil society and domestic and international organizations, the committee retracted both amendments. Save Romania Union was the only party with parliamentary representation that positioned itself against a potential referendum to amend the constitutional definition of the family and ban same-sex marriage in Romania.

====2018 referendum====

The Romanian Government announced plans to hold a referendum in the fall of 2017, following a successful citizens&#x27; initiative by a group opposed to same-sex marriage, the Coaliția pentru Familie, which collected an estimated 3 million signatures in support of banning same-sex marriage. The Chamber of Deputies approved the initiative on 9 May 2017 in a 232–22 vote. However, no referendum was held that year. The government proposed to hold the referendum in May or June 2018, though these months also passed without a vote. Eventually, the referendum was confirmed to be held on 6 and 7 October 2018. The amendment was supported by religious groups. President Klaus Iohannis opposed the amendment, while many human rights activists called for a boycott. The referendum proceeded as planned on 6 and 7 October, and cost an estimated €43 million. It failed to achieve validity as the turnout was 21.1%, well below the 30% required under the law. The lowest turnout (8.5%) was recorded in Covasna County. The highest turnout (30.7%) was in Suceava County, the only county to surpass the 30% threshold.

===Court cases===
====2018 Constitutional Court ruling====
On 27 September 2018, less than two weeks before the referendum to ban same-sex marriage, the Constitutional Court of Romania ruled that same-sex couples have the same rights to privacy and family life as heterosexual couples. The ruling, hailed as &quot;landmark&quot; by LGBT advocacy groups, stated that legal rights and obligations should be equal under law. However, the court also ruled that the term &quot;spouses&quot; can only refer to a &quot;man and woman&quot;, since this was the intention of the original constitutional lawmakers.

====2018 European Court of Justice ruling====

In 2018, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in favour of a Romanian man, Adrian Coman, who sought to have his marriage to his American husband Clai Hamilton recognised in Romania. The couple had married in Belgium in 2010, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2003. European Union (EU) law permits a non-EU spouse of an EU citizen to join their spouse in the member state where the European national resides. However, Romanian authorities refused to issue a residence permit to Hamilton, arguing that he could not be recognised as Coman&#x27;s spouse because Romanian law prohibits same-sex marriages. The couple filed suit, arguing that the refusal discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, which is banned in Romania.

The Romanian Constitutional Court heard oral arguments in the case in 2016 and later decided to consult the ECJ on the matter. The ECJ began examining the case in November 2017. In January 2018, Advocate General Melchior Wathelet advised the court to rule in favour of the couple:
Opinions of the Advocate General are not legally binding but are normally followed by the court. The ECJ ruled in the couple&#x27;s favour on 5 June 2018, holding in &quot;Coman and Others v General Inspectorate for Immigration and Ministry of the Interior&quot; that EU member states may choose whether or not to allow same-sex marriage, but they cannot obstruct the freedom of residence of an EU citizen and their spouse. The court also ruled that the term &quot;spouse&quot; is gender-neutral and does not necessarily imply a person of the opposite sex. Coman welcomed the ruling, saying, &quot;We can now look in the eyes of any public official in Romania and across the EU with certainty that our relationship is equally valuable and equally relevant for the purpose of free movement within the EU.&quot; White &amp; Case, the law firm that represented the couple, and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) welcomed the court ruling, but it drew criticism from religious and conservative groups. The Romanian Orthodox Church called the ruling &quot;anti-democratic&quot;.

On 18 July 2018, the Romanian Constitutional Court ruled that the state must grant residency rights to the same-sex partners of EU citizens. This followed an attempt for recognition by Coman and Hamilton following the ECJ ruling the previous month. In March 2021, it was reported that Romania had yet to issue a residence permit to Hamilton.

In September 2023, the government announced its intention to draft legislation to comply with the ECJ ruling. The draft law would allow foreign same-sex marriages performed in a European Union state to be recognized in Romania.

===Religious performance===
Most major Christian denominations in Romania do not bless or perform same-sex marriages. The Romanian Greek Catholic Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church oppose same-sex marriage and do not allow their clergy to officiate at such marriages. The three denominations campaigned to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage in the 2018 referendum. The Unitarian Church of Transylvania did not take a position on the amendment. In 2017, its synod voted to only bless marriages recognized by the state, but allowed individual members to express their own opinions on the matter. Deputy Bishop Dávid Gyerő expressed support for same-sex marriage in 2016.

Romania&#x27;s first religious same-sex marriage ceremony was performed on 5 June 2006 following Bucharest Pride, when Florin Buhuceanu, a spokesman for ACCEPT, married his Spanish partner of four years. The symbolic marriage, which has no legal status in Romania, was blessed by the Metropolitan Community Church in Bucharest, an international denomination which recognises same-sex unions and supports LGBT rights. The couple officially married later in 2006 in a civil marriage in Spain, where same-sex marriage is legal.

==Public opinion==
The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 21% of Romanians supported same-sex marriage. This represented a 10% increase from 2006. Support across the European Union was 61%. According to a 2017 Pew Research Center poll, 26% of Romanians supported same-sex marriage, while 74% were opposed. Opposition was 66% among 18–34-year-olds. An IRES () poll conducted in December 2018 found that 27% of Romanians supported same-sex marriage, while 72% were opposed and 1% were undecided or did not answer. In addition, 38% of Romanians supported registered partnerships, while 60% were opposed and 2% were undecided or did not answer.

The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 29% of Romanians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 63% were against.

An ACCEPT 2021 study, carried out by telephone questionnaires on 1,064 people aged 18 years old and over, showed that 43% of respondents supported reforms to allow either civil unions or same-sex marriage. This figure was twice what had been reported in 2016. Support was highest among those who were under the age of 34 at 56%. Of those questioned, 68% said that same-sex families should be protected by the law in Romania like all other families. The majority of those that expressed support for allowing same-sex marriage also supported allowing same-sex couples to raise children.

A GLOBSEC survey conducted in March 2023 showed that 37% of Romanians supported same-sex marriage, while 58% were opposed. The 2023 Eurobarometer found that 25% of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 69% were opposed. The survey also found that 27% of Romanians thought that &quot;there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex&quot;, while 68% disagreed. This was the second lowest level of support for same-sex marriage in the European Union, ahead only of Bulgaria.

<text>The Barbary lion was a population of the lion subspecies &quot;Panthera leo leo&quot;. It was also called North African lion, Atlas lion and Egyptian lion. It lived in the mountains and deserts of the Maghreb of North Africa from Morocco to Egypt. It was eradicated following the spread of firearms and bounties for shooting lions. A comprehensive review of hunting and sighting records revealed that small groups of lions may have survived in Algeria until the early 1960s, and in Morocco until the mid-1960s. Today, it is locally extinct in this region. Fossils of the Barbary lion dating to between 100,000 and 110,000 years were found in the cave of Bizmoune near Essaouira.

Until 2017, the Barbary lion was considered a distinct lion subspecies. Results of morphological and genetic analyses of lion samples from North Africa showed that the Barbary lion does not differ significantly from the Asiatic lion and falls into the same subclade. This North African/Asian subclade is closely related to lions from West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa, and therefore grouped into the northern lion subspecies &quot;Panthera leo leo&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Barbary lion zoological specimens range in colour from light to dark tawny. Male lion skins had manes of varying colouration and length.
Head-to-tail length of stuffed males in zoological collections varies from , and of females around . Skull size varied from . Some manes extended over the shoulder and under the belly to the elbows. The mane hair was long. 

In 19th-century hunter accounts, the Barbary lion was claimed to be the largest lion, with a weight of wild males ranging from . Yet, the accuracy of such data measured in the field is questionable. Captive Barbary lions were much smaller but kept under such poor conditions that they might not have attained their full potential size and weight.

The colour and size of lions&#x27; manes was long thought to be a sufficiently distinct morphological characteristic to accord a subspecific status to lion populations. Mane development varies with age and between individuals from different regions, and is therefore not a sufficient characteristic for subspecific identification. The size of manes is not regarded as evidence for Barbary lions&#x27; ancestry. Instead, results of mitochondrial DNA research support the genetic distinctness of Barbary lions in a unique haplotype found in museum specimens that is thought to be of Barbary lion descent. The presence of this haplotype is considered a reliable molecular marker to identify captive Barbary lions.
Barbary lions may have developed long-haired manes, because of lower temperatures in the Atlas Mountains than in other African regions, particularly in winter.
Results of a long-term study on lions in Serengeti National Park indicate that ambient temperature, nutrition and the level of testosterone influence the colour and size of lion manes.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Felis leo&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a type specimen from Constantine, Algeria. Following Linnaeus&#x27;s description, several lion zoological specimens from North Africa were described and proposed as subspecies in the 19th century:
*&quot;Felis leo barbaricus&quot;, described by the Austrian zoologist Johann Nepomuk Meyer in 1826, was a lion skin from the Barbary Coast.
*&quot;Felis leo nubicus&quot;, described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843, was a male lion from Nubia that had been sent by Antoine Clot from Cairo to Paris, and died in the Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes in 1841.
In 1930, Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the lion to the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;, when he wrote about the Asiatic lion.

In the 20th and early 21st centuries, there has been much debate and controversy among zoologists on lion classification and validity of proposed subspecies:
*In 1939, Glover Morrill Allen considered &quot;F. l. barbaricus&quot; and &quot;nubicus&quot; synonymous with &quot;F. l. leo&quot;.
*In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott recognized only two lion subspecies in the Palearctic realm, namely the African lion &quot;Panthera leo leo&quot; and the Asiatic lion &quot;P. l. persica&quot;.
*Some authors considered &quot;P. l. nubicus&quot; a valid subspecies and synonymous with &quot;P. l. massaica&quot;.
*In 2005, &quot;P. l. barbarica&quot;, &quot;nubica&quot; and &quot;somaliensis&quot; were subsumed under &quot;P. l. leo&quot;.
*In 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used &quot;P. l. leo&quot; for all lion populations in Africa.
The Barbary lion was considered a distinct lion subspecies.
In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group subsumed the lion populations in North, West and Central Africa and Asia to &quot;P. l. leo&quot;.

The Barbary lion was also called North African lion, Atlas lion, and Egyptian lion.

===Genetic research===
Results of a phylogeographic analysis using samples from African and Asiatic lions was published in 2006. One of the African samples was a vertebra from the National Museum of Natural History (France) that originated in the Nubian part of Sudan. In terms of mitochondrial DNA, it grouped with lion skull samples from the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and the northern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

While the historical Barbary lion was morphologically distinct, its genetic uniqueness remained questionable.
In a comprehensive study about the evolution of lions in 2008, 357 samples of wild and captive lions from Africa and India were examined. Results showed that four captive lions from Morocco did not exhibit any unique genetic characteristic, but shared mitochondrial haplotypes with lion samples from West and Central Africa. They were all part of a major mtDNA grouping that also included Asiatic lion samples. Results provided evidence for the hypothesis that this group developed in East Africa, and about 118,000 years ago traveled north and west in the first wave of lion expansion. It broke up within Africa, and later in West Asia. Lions in Africa probably constitute a single population that interbred during several waves of migration since the Late Pleistocene. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion specimen from Sudan clustered with &quot;P. l. leo&quot; in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to &quot;P. l. melanochaita&quot;.

A comprehensive genetic study published in 2016 confirmed the close relationship between the extinct Barbary lions from Northern Africa and lions from Central and West Africa and in addition showed that the former fall into the same subclade as the Asiatic lion.

==Former distribution and habitat==
Fossils of the Barbary lion dating to between 100,000 and 110,000 years were found in the cave of Bizmoune near Essaouira.
The Barbary lion lived in the mountains and deserts of the Maghreb of North Africa from Morocco to Egypt. It was eradicated following the spread of firearms and bounties for shooting lions.
Today, it is locally extinct in this region.
Historical sighting and hunting records from the 19th and 20th centuries show that the Barbary lion survived in Algeria until the early 1960s, and in Morocco until the mid-1960s. It inhabited Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. The westernmost sighting of a Barbary lion reportedly occurred in the Anti-Atlas in western Morocco. It ranged from the Atlas Mountains and the Rif in Morocco, the Ksour and Amour Ranges in Algeria to the Aurès Mountains in Tunisia.
In Algeria, the Barbary lion was sighted in the forested hills and mountains between Ouarsenis in the west to the Chelif River plains in the north and the Pic de Taza in the east. It inhabited the forests and wooded hills of the Constantine Province southward into the Aurès Mountains.

In the 1830s, lions may have already been eliminated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and near human settlements.
In Libya, the Barbary lion persisted along the coast until the beginning of the 18th century, and was extirpated in Tunisia by 1890. By the mid-19th century, the Barbary lion population had massively declined, since bounties were paid for shooting lions. The cedar forests of Chelia and neighbouring mountains in Algeria harboured lions until about 1884. The Barbary lion disappeared in the Bône region by 1890, in the Khroumire and Souk Ahras regions by 1891, and in Batna Province by 1893.
The last recorded shooting of a wild Barbary lion took place in 1942 near Tizi n&#x27;Tichka in the Moroccan part of the Atlas Mountains. A small relict population may have survived in remote montane areas into the early 1960s. The last known sighting of a lion in Algeria occurred in 1956 in Beni Ourtilane District.

Historical accounts indicate that in Egypt, lions occurred in the Sinai Peninsula, along the Nile, in the Eastern and Western Deserts, in the region of Wadi El Natrun and along the maritime coast of the Mediterranean. In the 14th century BC, Thutmose IV hunted lions in the hills near Memphis. The growth of civilizations along the Nile and in the Sinai Peninsula by the beginning of the second millennium BC and desertification contributed to isolating lion populations in North Africa.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In the early 20th century, when Barbary lions were rare, they were sighted in pairs or in small family groups comprising a male and female lion with one or two cubs. Between 1839 and 1942, sightings of wild lions involved solitary animals, pairs and family units. Analysis of these sightings indicate that lions retained living in prides even when under increasing persecution, particularly in the eastern Maghreb. The size of prides was likely similar to prides living in sub-Saharan habitats, whereas the density of the Barbary lion population is considered to have been lower than in moister habitats.

When Barbary stag (&quot;Cervus elaphus barbarus&quot;) and gazelles became scarce in the Atlas Mountains, lions preyed on herds of livestock that were carefully tended. They also preyed on wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;).

Sympatric predators in this region included the African leopard (&quot;P. pardus pardus&quot;) and Atlas bear (&quot;Ursus arctos crowtheri&quot;).

==In captivity==

The lions kept in the menagerie at the Tower of London in the Middle Ages were Barbary lions, as shown by DNA testing on two well-preserved skulls excavated at the Tower in 1936 and 1937. The skulls were radiocarbon-dated to around 1280–1385 and 1420−1480.
In the 19th century and the early 20th century, lions were often kept in hotels and circus menageries. In 1835, the lions in the Tower of London were transferred to improved enclosures at the London Zoo on the orders of the Duke of Wellington.

The lions in the Rabat Zoo exhibited characteristics thought typical for the Barbary lion. Nobles and Berber people presented lions as gifts to the royal family of Morocco. When the family was forced into exile in 1953, the lions in Rabat, numbering 21 altogether, were transferred to two zoos in the region. Three of these were shifted to a zoo in Casablanca, with the rest being shifted to Meknès. The lions at Meknès were moved back to the palace in 1955, but those at Casablanca never came back. In the late 1960s, new lion enclosures were built in Temara near Rabat. Results of a mtDNA research revealed in 2006 that a lion kept in the German Zoo Neuwied originated from this collection and is very likely a descendant of a Barbary lion.
Five lion samples from this collection were not Barbary lions maternally. Nonetheless, genes of the Barbary lion are likely to be present in common European zoo lions, since this was one of the most frequently introduced subspecies. Many lions in European and American zoos, which are managed without subspecies classification, are most likely descendants of Barbary lions. Several researchers and zoos supported the development of a studbook of lions directly descended from the King of Morocco&#x27;s collection.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the Addis Ababa Zoo kept 16 adult lions. With their dark, brown manes extending through the front legs, they looked like Barbary or Cape lions. Their ancestors were caught in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a zoological collection for Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.

Since 2005, three Barbary lions were kept in Belfast Zoo obtained from Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, and a new Barbary lion enclosure was opened in 2023.

==Cultural significance==
The lion also appeared frequently in early Egyptian art and literature. Statues and statuettes of lions found at Hierakonpolis and Koptos in Upper Egypt date to the Early Dynastic Period. The early Egyptian deity Mehit was depicted with a lion head. In Ancient Egypt, the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was venerated as protector of the country. She represented destructive power, but was also regarded as protector against famine and disease. Lion-headed figures and amulets were excavated in tombs in the Aegean islands of Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Paros and Chios. They are associated with Sekhmet and date to the early Iron Age between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. The remains of seven mostly subadult lions were excavated at the necropolis Umm El Qa&#x27;ab in a tomb of Hor-Aha, dated to the 31st century BC. In 2001, the skeleton of a mummified lion was found in the tomb of Maïa in a necropolis dedicated to Tutankhamun at Saqqara. It had probably lived and died in the Ptolemaic period, showed signs of malnutrition and had probably lived in captivity for many years.
The Barbary lion is a symbol in Nubian culture and was often depicted in art and architecture. Nubian deities, such as Amun, Amesemi, Apedemak, Arensnuphis, Hathor, Bastet, Dedun, Mehit, Menhit, and Sebiumeker, were depicted as lion protectors in Kushite religion.

In Roman North Africa, lions were regularly captured by experienced hunters for venatio spectacles in amphitheatres.

The Morocco national football team is called the &quot;Atlas Lions&quot;, and the supporters are usually seen wearing T-shirts with a lion&#x27;s face or wearing a lion suit.

<text>Caravaggio is a 1986 British historical drama film directed by Derek Jarman. The film is a fictionalised retelling of the life of Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is Tilda Swinton&#x27;s film debut.

==Plot==
Told in a segmented fashion, the film opens as Caravaggio dies from lead poisoning while in exile, with only his long-time, mute companion Jerusaleme, who was given by his family to the artist as a boy, by his side. Caravaggio thinks back to his life as a teenage street ruffian who hustles and paints. While taken ill and in the care of priests, young Caravaggio catches the eye of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte. The Cardinal nurtures Caravaggio&#x27;s artistic and intellectual development but seems to molest him.

As an adult, Caravaggio still lives under the roof of, and paints with the funding of, Del Monte. Caravaggio is shown employing street people, drunks and prostitutes as models for his intense, usually religious paintings. He is depicted as frequently brawling, gambling, getting drunk and is implied to sleep with both male and female models. In the art world, Caravaggio is regarded as vulgar and entitled for his Vatican connections.

One day, Ranuccio, a street fighter for pay, catches Caravaggio&#x27;s eye as a subject and potential lover. Ranuccio also introduces Caravaggio to his girlfriend Lena, who also becomes an object of attraction and a model to the artist. When both Ranuccio and Lena are separately caught kissing Caravaggio, each displays jealousy over the artist&#x27;s attentions. One day, Lena announces she is pregnant without stating who the father is and will become a mistress to the wealthy Scipione Borghese. Soon, she is found murdered by drowning. Ranuccio weeps as Caravaggio and Jerusaleme clean Lena&#x27;s body. Caravaggio is shown painting Lena after she dies and mournfully writhing with her body. Ranuccio is arrested for Lena&#x27;s murder, but he claims to be innocent. Caravaggio pulls strings and goes to the pope to free Ranuccio. When Ranuccio is freed, he tells Caravaggio he killed Lena so they could be together. In response, Caravaggio cuts Ranuccio&#x27;s throat, killing him. Back on his deathbed, Caravaggio is shown having visions of himself as a boy and trying to refuse the last rites offered him by the priests.

== Cast ==
==Production==
===Set design===
In keeping with Caravaggio&#x27;s use of contemporary dress for his Biblical figures, Jarman intentionally includes several anachronisms in the film that do not fit with Caravaggio&#x27;s life in the 16th century. In one scene, Caravaggio is in a bar lit with electric lights. Another character is seen using an electronic calculator. Car horns are heard honking outside Caravaggio&#x27;s studio, and in one scene, Caravaggio is seen leaning on a green truck. Cigarette smoking, a motorbike, and the use of a manual typewriter also featured in the film.

===Production design===
The production designer was Christopher Hobbs who was also responsible for the copies of Caravaggio paintings seen in the film.

==Details and awards==
&quot;Caravaggio&quot; was Jarman&#x27;s first project with Tilda Swinton, and it was her first film role. The cook Jennifer Paterson was an extra. The film was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement.

==Home media==
&quot;Caravaggio&quot; was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in July 2008. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the trailer, a gallery of production designs and storyboards, feature commentary by Gabriel Berestain, an interview with Christopher Hobbs titled &quot;Italy of the Memory&quot;, and interviews with Tilda Swinton, Derek Jarman, Nigel Terry.

<doc id="1131049" wikidata="Q506941" url="?curid=1131049" title="Russian pyramid">
<text>Russian pyramid, also known as Russian billiards (, ), is a form of billiards played on a large billiard table with narrow pockets. It is played across Russia and several former Soviet/Eastern Bloc countries. In the West, the game is known as pyramid billiards, or simply pyramid.

==Equipment==
*Table: Playing-surface sizes vary. The official tournament size is , the same size used for professional snooker. Smaller sizes as used by other cue sports are also found in less-formal venues. The used in Russian pyramid tables are typically much thinner than those of pool and snooker tables, but is occasionally heated, similar to carom billiards tables.
*Balls: There are sixteen balls, fifteen and a , but in contrast to pool, the numbered balls are usually white, and the cue ball is red or yellow. They are typically larger and heavier than other types of billiard balls. The official tournament size is in diameter, weighing approximately 255 g (9 oz), while smaller balls – e.g., , , and (regular pool ball size) – are available for smaller table sizes. The old tournament size was 68 mm in diameter.
*Pockets: The are only 3 mm (approx. in) wider than the diameter of the ball, while the are 12–13 mm (approx. – in) wider than the diameter of the ball. This requires great precision to pocket a ball in such tight pockets.
*Cues: Due to larger ball size, the cues used for Russian pyramid are slightly thicker and heavier than those of pool cues, and the tip diameter is wider (up to 15 mm), in comparison to 10–13 mm used in pool cues. Specialty shots like and are usually more difficult to perform with a Russian pyramid cue, due to its heavier nature. These shots are also not allowed in official tournaments, doing so may result in a .

==Rule variations==

There are several rule variations of Russian pyramid. All games begin with fifteen numbered white balls in a , as in straight pool, eight-ball, and blackball. Players may pocket any object balls on the table regardless of number, and the first player to pocket eight or more balls wins the . In addition, shots do not have to be .
Depending on the game variant, some specific balls may have to be in specific positions within the rack. The first player firmly s the rack with the from just in front of the .
The most common varieties are the following, each of which has slight local variations on the rules:
*Free pyramid (also known as American pyramid)
:Any ball may be used as the cue ball. Players can pocket the ball they struck if it hits another ball first, with the goal being to the struck ball off one or more other balls into a pocket. Should the struck ball be pocketed without striking any other balls, the shot is a , and that ball is behind the baulk line.

*Dynamic pyramid (also known as Siberian pyramid or Nevsky pyramid)
:Only one ball is the cue ball. Players can pocket the cue ball with a carom shot off another ball and then the scorer must choose an object ball to be taken off the table. The player then has and may place it anywhere on the table but may not pocket it until the next stroke; otherwise, it is a foul.

*Combined pyramid (also known as Moscow pyramid or combo pyramid)
:The rules are the same as in dynamic pyramid, except that, after the cue ball is pocketed, the cue ball is spotted between the () and head or baulk, but not on top of that line; from here until the next stroke, balls can be only pocketed in the side and far-corner pockets. In pool, this part of the table is called the and the Russian equivalent is (&quot;dom&quot;), &#x27;house&#x27;.

*Classical pyramid
:The rules are similar to fifteen-ball pool. The object is to score at least 71 points. For each correctly pocketed object ball, the player wins the number of points on the ball (except for the 1-ball, which scores 11 points). The last remaining ball on the table, regardless of its number, is worth 10 points. The total number of points is 130.

*14.1 pyramid (also known as straight pyramid or long pyramid)
:The rules are very similar to free pyramid, except that a frame continues until 14 balls are pocketed, similar to straight pool; these 14 balls are then re-spotted into an incomplete pyramid. The objective is to score at least a given number of points.

*Scratch pyramid (also known as SVOI)
:Similar to free pyramid, but pocketing object balls before the cue ball is a foul; therefore, the player must pocket the cue ball after hitting object balls. Other balls can be pocketed as long as the cue ball is potted first.

==In popular culture==
Versions of the game have featured prominently in notable Russian films such as &quot;The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed&quot; (1979) and &quot;The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers&quot; (1968). An episode of the popular animated television series &quot;Kikoriki&quot; has two characters playing the game. The main characters of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, or &quot;Zhmurki&quot; (Russian: Жмурки) play Russian pool in the bar scene.

A Russian pool configuration can be seen in “Tulsa King” starring Sylvester Stallone in Season 1, episode 5, while making a phone call, he walks around a pool table with all-white balls racked, and a white cue ball.

Russian pyramid has been adapted into video games, both in stand-alone form and as a play mode in multi-cue-sports video games. Many recent releases have been mobile games for Android and iOS.

==&quot;Russian pool&quot;==
Colored numbered balls for playing eight-ball, nine-ball, and other pool games on Russian billiards tables are also produced. The balls are 68 mm ( in) in diameter, like the standard ones for Russian pyramid, and thus much larger than the American-style balls they are patterned after .

<text>The Te Ana-au caves are a culturally and ecologically important system of limestone caves on the western shore of Lake Te Anau, in the southwest of New Zealand. They were re-discovered in 1948 by Lawson Burrows, who found the upper entry after three years of searching, following clues in old Māori legends. It later became a major tourist attraction for the area, as the part of the caverns close to the lake shore is home to glowworms. The unofficial name used by the national caving association is &quot;Aurora&quot;. The caves are geologically young (estimated 12,000 years) and hence there is only one tiny stalactite.

The Māori name Te Ana-au can be translated as &quot;The Swirling Cave&quot; (&quot;te&quot;: the; &quot;ana&quot;: cave; &quot;au&quot;: swirling) in reference to the water running through it. The water, Tunnel Burn, is the outflow of Lake Orbell.

Lawson Burrows and his business partner Wilson Campbell set up Fiordland Travels as a tourism company for their venture. In 1965, they sold their company to Olive and Les Hutchins, who had been in the tourism business in Fiordland since 1954. The Hutchins took over the company name but rebranded in 2002 to Real Journeys. The company rebranded again to RealNZ in 2022.

Since the caves lie in the Murchison Mountains (where the endangered South Island takahē were rediscovered), and are themselves very fragile, access is restricted. Commercial guided tours by punt through the water-filled caverns run daily, operated by RealNZ.

<text>The Rogerenes (also known as the Rogerene Quakers or Rogerines) were a religious sect founded in 1674 by John Rogers (1648–1721) in New London, Connecticut. Rogers was imprisoned and spent some years there. He was influenced by the Seventh Day Baptists and the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and opposed the established Puritan church. 

Rogerenes initially held to a Seventh Day (Saturday) Sabbath, but over the years began to regard each day as equally holy. Their disdain for Sunday worship often brought them into sharp conflict with their neighbors. Increasingly, they adopted, a pacifist stance, including war tax resistance, which further brought them the ridicule of the larger community. 

Some of the Rogerenes left Connecticut and migrated to New Jersey. settling in parts of present-day Morris County. One such group settled in what is now the Landing section of Roxbury Township, New Jersey near Lake Rogerine, known as Mountain Pond in about 1700. Another, smaller group of Rogerenes in about 1734 settled on the eastern side of Schooley&#x27;s Mountain near present-day Hackettstown, New Jersey.

After their conflict with the Congregational church waned and disappeared the Connecticut Rogerenes became active in the Abolitionist movement. They continued their anti-war stance by sponsoring peace rallies at an open-air site near Mystic that by the 1880s attracted thousands of attendees. The site is now known as the Peace Sanctuary. Because their progressive attitudes were increasingly mirrored in American society as it evolved from the 19th century into the 20th, the Rogerenes gradually disappeared as a distinct social and religious group.
