<text>Mr. Majestyk is a 1974 American action film directed by Richard Fleischer and written by Elmore Leonard. Charles Bronson stars as the title character, a melon farmer and Vietnam War veteran who comes into conflict with gangsters. Leonard, who wrote the film with an original screenplay, took the name Majestyk from a character in his 1969 crime novel &quot;The Big Bounce&quot;. He would also write the novelization of the film.

==Plot==
Vince Majestyk is a farmer, and a former U.S. Army Ranger instructor and Vietnam War veteran, who owns and operates a watermelon farm in rural Colorado. He needs to harvest his crop soon in order to keep the farm financially solvent.

A small-time hood, Bobby Kopas, attempts to coerce Majestyk into a protection racket of using unskilled drunks to harvest his watermelon crop. Majestyk runs him off with Kopas&#x27; own shotgun and hires experienced Mexican migrant workers, including Nancy Chavez, a crop picker who is also a union leader. Kopas brings assault charges against Majestyk, resulting in the farmer being placed under arrest before he can finish the harvest.

In jail, Majestyk meets and annoys Frank Renda, a notorious mob hit man being transferred to a higher-security prison. Renda&#x27;s men try to break him out of police custody during a prisoner transport by bus. In the escape attempt, Majestyk drives off in the bus with Renda still in handcuffs, eventually taking him to his hunting cabin in the nearby foothills. Majestyk hopes to trade Renda to the police in return for being released to finish harvesting his melons. Renda offers his captor $25,000 for his freedom, but Majestyk declines. Renda then threatens to kill Majestyk if he doesn&#x27;t release him, and Majestyk pretends to be persuaded to take the money, but contacts both the police and Renda&#x27;s mafia contacts to come pick them up.

Wiley, Renda&#x27;s girlfriend, arrives and they manage to turn the tables on Majestyk, although he is able to escape. Renda learns the charges for which he had been imprisoned have been dropped. He meets up with his right-hand man, Lundy, who advises him to fly to Mexico and enjoy himself; Renda will have none of it as he wants revenge on Majestyk. He arranges for Kopas to drop the assault charges against Majestyk, and orders his men to find the &quot;melon picker&quot; so he can have the satisfaction of killing him personally.

They arrive at the farm to kill Majestyk, but not finding him they instead machine-gun the melons and rough up the hired hands, forcing them to depart. That same night, as Majestyk and Nancy have a drink at a bar in town Renda approaches and tells him he plans to kill him. Instead of being intimidated, Majestyk knocks Renda down, telling him to &quot;call the cops&quot;, further infuriating Renda. The next day, Kopas badly injures Majestyk&#x27;s foreman Larry Mendoza, as he tries to deliver a load of melons, putting him in the hospital.

Renda and his men surround Majestyk&#x27;s home, but Majestyk gets away in the back of a pickup truck driven by Nancy, and a prolonged car chase ensues. The police set up roadblocks and launch a helicopter hoping to find them. Luring Renda and his men into the foothills, Majestyk turns the tables on them and becomes the attacker, killing most of Renda&#x27;s men during the pursuit. Realizing they are now the hunted, Renda retreats to their lodge hideout where he, Wiley, Lundy, and Kopas hole up. Renda sends Wiley outside to negotiate with Majestyk, hoping to force him to show himself, but Majestyk sends her away with Nancy. After removing the keys from their vehicle, Majestyk then assaults the cabin, killing Lundy after Renda sacrifices him to save himself. Disgusted, Kopas decides to leave when he realizes Renda will also sacrifice him to get to Majestyk. With Kopas&#x27; help, Majestyk gets the drop on Renda and kills him. The police soon arrive and arrest Kopas and Wiley, while Majestyk drives off with Nancy.

==Production==
===Filming===
The movie was filmed on location in La Junta, Colorado, Canon City, Colorado, Rocky Ford, Colorado, and Manzanola, Colorado.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The Ford Motor Company used scenes licensed from the movie showing extreme driving of Majestyk&#x27;s 1968 Ford F-100 pickup truck during commercials for its 1976 Ford trucks.

===Home Media===
The film was first released to DVD in 2003 by MGM/UA on a dual-sided disc that contained both the Widescreen and Standard versions. On the back cover there is a picture of Bronson holding a shotgun with a cigarette in his mouth. Although Bronson smoked in real life, his character in the movie smoked only once, indicating that this may be an outtake or publicity still. The picture is missing from the back cover of Kino Lorber&#x27;s Blu-ray release for 2021, but is still there on the 2014 bare-bones release.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The movie was popular with Bronson action film enthusiasts. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Except for some dutiful splattering of gore, it ticks along rather steadily, under Richard Fleischer&#x27;s unruffled direction. There is a take-it-or-leave-it air that snugly suits the star&#x27;s performance, or vice versa.&quot; The scene in which Nancy and Majestyk drive away in a pickup truck with Renda&#x27;s men in hot pursuit became one of the most famous chase sequences of the period, following the recent trend of those in &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968) and &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971).

On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an 82% rating based on 17 reviews.

<text>Lake Christabel is a small lake in the north of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located 12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass. The lake is the source of the Grey River, one of the longest rivers on the South Island&#x27;s West Coast, although its outlet is underground. The lake lies behind a landslide dam, thought to have been created by a prehistoric earthquake. The river runs under the debris for about . A 1976 survey said it was, &quot;one of the very few lakes in New Zealand in a natural, unmodified state&quot;. It estimated its depth at over . Galaxias brevipinnis (climbing galaxias) and Anquilla dieffenbachii (longfin eel) were the only fish found.

<text>Milton-next-Gravesend is an area and ecclesiastical parish, part of the Gravesend built-up area, in the Gravesham district, north-west of Kent, England.

==History==
Feudal ownership of land in the parish was the subject of a legal action of 1076, &quot;Abbot Scotland v Hamo the Sherrif&quot; [sic], leading to St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury taking back its stake in ownership.

Neighbouring Gravesend became a town under Royal Charter in the 13th century and included Milton. The Church of England&#x27;s founding was heralded by Henry VIII&#x27;s split with Rome and the Dissolution of the Monasteries by which all of the abbots were retired, and their institutions&#x27; endowments – such as in this parish – were confiscated.

Until about the 1840s, much of the population was scattered in rural farmhouses, country houses and cottages or those living along the east side of the High Street and thus not in Gravesend parish. The boundary between the two parishes is along the middle of Gravesend&#x27;s High Street (which puts the old Town Hall in Milton, not Gravesend) then Windmill Street and Singlewell Road. Just as Northfleet developed to the west of Gravesend, so decennial censuses record that this parish saw an almost fourfold increase in population between 1831 and 1901 (from 4,348 to 9,256, in 1851, to 15,534 in 1901). In the next ten year census the number of houses slightly increased, as did occupation rates; the population next stood at 14,994.

On 1 April 1915 the parish was abolished and merged with Gravesend. It is now in the unparished area of Gravesend.

==Churches==
Two churches co-exist: the ancient parish church, dedicated to St Peter and Paul (at ) at the heart of the old settlement; and Christ Church at the western end of the parish, built in 1856 when the town of Gravesend began to grow eastwards. In other faith centres, the parish has the more protestant place of worship of St Paul&#x27;s United Reformed Church, and two small independent churches/chapels.

St Peter and St Paul saw five of its bells cast in 1656 by John Hodson. A treble was added in 1810 (cast by Thomas Mears II) and the ring was augmented to 8 by two new trebles in 1930 (cast by Mears &amp; Stainbank). The tenor is just under , tuned to F#.

==Notable people==
Sarah Baker (c.1735–1816), actress and theatre manager, was born here.

<doc id="1126377" wikidata="Q599966" url="?curid=1126377" title="Peyer's patch">
<text>Peyer&#x27;s patches (or aggregated lymphoid nodules) are organized lymphoid follicles, named after the 17th-century Swiss anatomist Johann Conrad Peyer. They are an important part of gut associated lymphoid tissue usually found in humans in the lowest portion of the small intestine, mainly in the distal jejunum and the ileum, but also could be detected in the duodenum.

== History == 

Peyer&#x27;s patches had been observed and described by several anatomists during the 17th century, but in 1677 Swiss anatomist Johann Conrad Peyer (1653–1712) described the patches so clearly that they were eventually named after him. However, Peyer regarded them as glands which discharged, into the small intestine, some substance which facilitated digestion. It was not until 1850 that the Swiss physician Rudolph Oskar Ziegler (1828–1881) suggested, after careful microscopic examination, that Peyer&#x27;s patches were actually lymph glands.

== Structure ==
Peyer&#x27;s patches are observable as elongated thickenings of the intestinal mucosa measuring a few centimeters in length. About 100 are found in humans. Microscopically, Peyer&#x27;s patches appear as oval or round lymphoid follicles (similar to lymph nodes) located in the mucosa layer of the ileum and extend into the submucosa layer.
The number of Peyer&#x27;s patches peaks at age 15–25 and then declines during adulthood.
In the distal ileum, they are numerous and they form a lymphoid ring. At least 46% of Peyer&#x27;s patches are concentrated in the distal 25 cm of ileum in humans. It is important to note that there are large variations in size, shape, and distribution of Peyer&#x27;s patches from one individual to another one.
In adults, B lymphocytes are seen to dominate the follicles&#x27; germinal centers. T lymphocytes are found in the zones between follicles. Among the mononuclear cells, CD4+/CD25+ (10%) cells and CD8+/CD25+ (5%) cells are more abundant in Peyer&#x27;s patches than in the peripheral blood.

Peyer&#x27;s patches are characterized by the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), which covers all lymphoid follicles. FAE differs from typical small intestinal villus epithelium: it has fewer goblet cells therefore mucus layer is thinner, and it is also characterized by the presence of specialized M cells or microfold cells, which provide uptake and transport of antigens from lumen. Moreover, basal lamina of follicle-associated epithelium is more porous compared to intestinal villus. Finally, follicle-associated epithelium is less permeable for ions and macromolecules, basically due to higher expression of tight junction proteins.

== Function ==
Because the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to the external environment, much of it is populated with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Peyer&#x27;s patches thus establish their importance in the immune surveillance of the intestinal lumen and in facilitating production of the immune response within the mucosa.

Pathogenic microorganisms and other antigens entering the intestinal tract encounter macrophages, dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, and T-lymphocytes found in Peyer&#x27;s patches and other sites of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Peyer&#x27;s patches thus act for the gastrointestinal system much as the tonsils act for the respiratory system, trapping foreign particles, surveilling them, and destroying them. Peyer&#x27;s patches have adaptive immune capabilities through inducing selective apoptosis of B cells due CD122-targeted interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling. Additionally, the B cell population can be restored. 

Peyer&#x27;s patches are covered by a special follicle-associated epithelium that contains specialized cells called microfold cells (M cells) which sample antigen directly from the lumen and deliver it to antigen-presenting cells (located in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side). Dendritic cells and macrophages can also directly sample the lumen by extending dendrites through transcellular M cell-specific pores. At the same time the paracellular pathway of follicle-associated epithelium is closed tightly to prevent penetration of antigens and continuous contact with immune cells. T cells, B-cells and memory cells are stimulated upon encountering antigen in Peyer&#x27;s patches. These cells then pass to the mesenteric lymph nodes where the immune response is amplified. Activated lymphocytes pass into the blood stream via the thoracic duct and travel to the gut where they carry out their final effector functions. The maturation of B-lymphocytes takes place in the Peyer&#x27;s patch.

==Clinical significance==
Although important in the immune response, excessive growth of lymphoid tissue in Peyer&#x27;s patches is pathologic, as hypertrophy of Peyer&#x27;s patches has been closely associated with idiopathic intussusception.

Having too many or larger than normal Peyer&#x27;s patches is associated with an increased risk of prion diseases, and intussusception in children. A history of viral illness is a risk factor for enlarged or inflamed Peyer&#x27;s patches.

&quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; and poliovirus also target this section of the intestine.

Disturbances in the gut microbiota and immune regulation within Peyer&#x27;s patches are implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease, where chronic inflammation can arise due to overactive immune responses. As Peyer&#x27;s patches are packed with immune cells and produce protective proteins such as secretory IgA to maintain gut balance, their dysfunction can trigger inappropriate immune responses, driving the inflammation and tissue damage characteristic of autoimmune diseases.

Several rivers have their sources on or close to the slopes of Mount Hopkins, notably the Landsborough River to the west, the Dobson River to the east, and Hopkins River to the south. At Mount Hopkins, the traditional boundaries of the former Otago, Westland, and Canterbury Provinces meet, these boundaries survive today as provincial districts, and only serve for the purposes of determining anniversary days. However, the modern day boundaries of the Otago region, the West Coast region and the Canterbury region meet further south at Mt Strauchon, which is also on the Main Divide.

<text>Jorge Samuel Caballero Álvarez (; born 24 December 1974) is a retired Honduran football defender.

He currently is the president of Honduran national league club Deportes Savio.

==Club career==
Caballero began his career with hometown club Deportivo Melgar. He then joined Olimpia, playing with the team from 1996 until transferring overseas in 2001. The central defender moved to Serie A to play for Udinese, where his second season was hampered by a long knee injury lay-off. He would remain in Udine until moving to Salernitana in 2004. He only played in 2 cup games for them and then signed for Nacional in Uruguay, but the move did not materialise since Nacional had too many foreigners in their squad, so he joined Defensor Sporting instead. In Uruguay he was unlucky with injuries again.

At the start of 2005, he moved to Major League Soccer and the Chicago Fire. Caballero had a disappointing 2005 with the club, and was released. He spent the 2006 preseason with the Colorado Rapids.

===China===
Caballero had a lengthy spell with Chinese side Changchun Yatai and played in the 2008 AFC Champions League with them.
In the 2008-2009 Winter Market it was reported that two teams from Honduras, Marathon and Olimpia, were interested in the signing of Samuel Caballero after he publicly stated his desire to return to Honduras in order to be close to family and return to the National Team. However, the player still had a contract with the Chinese Club Changchun Yatai and stated that if he did not receive any offers he would return to the club and complete his contract.

===Career end controversy===
In summer 2011 he finally returned to Honduras to sign with Necaxa and declared the team would be his final before retiring. However, he would never play for the club since he was still contracted to Changchun Yatai and they did not give him permission to play for Necaxa.

==International career==
Caballero has played an important part at the national team setup for over 10 years, mostly playing alongside other Honduran greats like Amado Guevara, Julio César de León and Carlos Pavón.
He made his debut for Honduras in a January 1998 friendly match against Costa Rica and has earned a total of 71 caps, scoring 11 goals. He has represented his country in 22 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 1999 UNCAF Nations Cup as well as at the 1998, 2000, 2005 and 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cups. Also, he played at the 2001 Copa América. and was one of three of Honduras&#x27; over-age players at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

His final international was a March 2009 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Trinidad &amp; Tobago.

<doc id="1126385" wikidata="Q970089" url="?curid=1126385" title="Unfaithful (2002 film)">
<text>Unfaithful is a 2002 American erotic thriller film directed and produced by Adrian Lyne and written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr., adapted from the Claude Chabrol film &quot;The Unfaithful Wife&quot; (1969). Starring Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Olivier Martinez, and Erik Per Sullivan, the film follows Edward (Gere) and Connie Sumner (Lane), a couple living in the suburbs of New York City whose marriage is jeopardized when the wife has an affair with a stranger (Martinez) she encounters by chance.

&quot;Unfaithful&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on May 10, 2002, and was screened at the 37th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on July 8, 2002. The film was a box office success, grossing $119.1 million against its $50 million production budget. Despite mixed reviews from critics, Lane received critical acclaim for her performance.

At the 7th Satellite Awards, Lane won for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, and was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role at the 9th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama at the 60th Golden Globe Awards, and the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 75th Academy Awards, respectively.

==Plot==
Edward and Connie Sumner live in upscale Westchester County, New York with their 8-year-old son, Charlie. While shopping in SoHo, the wind knocks Connie into a man named Paul Martel, and they fall over. At his apartment, Paul cleans and ices her leg, then puts his hand on hers. Connie gives him her first name only. Paul insists that Connie take a book before she leaves, pointing out a passage about seizing the moment. His number is inside the book.

Connie later calls him from Grand Central Terminal. Paul invites her over, and they flirt again. On her third visit, they dance and have sex. Connie keeps finding excuses to continue visiting Paul. Edward becomes suspicious when he notices Connie&#x27;s satin lingerie and catches her in a lie.

Edward fires an employee for perceived disloyalty. The employee, who saw Connie and Paul together, tells Edward to look at his own family. Edward hires a private investigator and is devastated to see photos confirming the affair.

One day, Connie forgets to pick up Charlie from school and realises her wrongdoing. With Edward being away, Connie attempts to give Paul a phone call and end the affair via phone call. With the phone call not being answered, Connie attempts to leave a voicemail message but is interrupted by Charlie. Connie then decides she wants to end things with Paul in person instead.

After doing a grocery shopping errand, she drives over to Paul&#x27;s home to tell him the news in person but spots him with another woman. She confronts him, and they later have an argument. She questions him about the number of women he is seeing. Paul, having no care for Connie’s frustration, arrogantly contradicts himself. He claims the other woman is just a friend and nothing more. However, Connie sees through the lie. She mentions that their affair is over and tells him she hates him. Connie angrily storms out of his apartment, but Paul unexpectedly catches up and forces himself on her. She tries to fight him off and pleads with him to stop. However, realising she is still attracted to Paul, Connie forgives him. At this point, Connie weakens his advances and Paul successfully wins her over. They then makeup with each other and have passionate sex in the hallway.

Connie leaves, missing Edward. Paul lets Edward in, and Edward finds a snow globe he gave Connie. He fractures Paul&#x27;s skull with it, killing him. While cleaning up the evidence, he overhears Connie&#x27;s voice message ending the affair. Edward erases it and puts Paul&#x27;s body in the trunk of his car before dumping it in a landfill.

NYPD detectives find Connie&#x27;s number at Paul&#x27;s and visit the Sumners&#x27;. His estranged wife has reported him missing. Connie is surprised that Paul was married, and claims that she barely knew him. The cops return when Paul&#x27;s body is found.

At the dry cleaner, Connie finds the photos of her and Paul in Edward&#x27;s clothes. At a party that night, she finds the snow globe back in their collection. When she confronts Edward, he reveals that he knew all along about her infidelity. Edward breaks down while mentioning how hard he worked to give her and Charlie a better life. He then accuses her of being ungrateful and throwing away all of his hard work for an affair. Edward confesses that he wanted to kill her, not Paul.

Days later, Connie discovers a hidden compartment in the snow globe, where years earlier, Edward placed a photograph of them and infant Charlie, with the message ″To My Beautiful Wife, the Best Part of Every Day!″ Realizing how much he loved her, she burns the incriminating photographs. Edward says that he will turn himself in, but she objects. They return to a normal life together.

Returning home one evening, Edward stops at a red light. Connie falls into an escape fantasy that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees it sounds perfect. Consoling her as she cries, it is revealed that Edward stopped next to a police station.

==Production==
===Development===
According to actor Richard Gere, an early draft of the screenplay presented the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship, which gave Connie some justification for having an affair. According to Gere and to director Adrian Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, to create greater sympathy for Connie. Both men opposed the change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio&#x27;s suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: &quot;I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. I loved the idea of the totally arbitrary nature of infidelity.&quot; The Sumners&#x27; relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair the result of a chance meeting.

===Pre-production===
During pre-production, the producers received a videotaped audition from Olivier Martinez, who was selected for Paul. His character was portrayed as French once Martinez was cast. Lyne said, &quot;I think it helps one understand how Connie might have leapt into this affair—he&#x27;s very beguiling, doing even ordinary things.&quot; Once cast in the role, Martinez, with Lyne&#x27;s approval, changed some of his dialogue and the scene in which he first seduces Lane&#x27;s character, while she is looking at a book in Braille. According to Martinez, &quot;The story that was invented before was much more sensual, erotic and clear.&quot;

George Clooney turned down his role in order to star in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;. Jennifer Lopez was offered the role of Connie, but turned it down she felt that the script &quot;wasn&#x27;t great&quot;. Lyne cast Diane Lane as Connie after seeing her in &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot;. He felt that the actress &quot;breathes a certain sexuality. But she&#x27;s sympathetic, and I think so many sexy women tend to be tough and hard at the same time.&quot; Lyne also wanted Gere and Lane to gain weight in order to portray the comfort of a middle-age couple. In particular, he wanted Gere to gain 30 pounds and left donuts in the actor&#x27;s trailer every morning.

Lyne asked director of photography Peter Biziou, with whom he made &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, to shoot &quot;Unfaithful&quot;. After reading the script, Biziou felt that the story was appropriate for the classic 1.85:1 aspect ratio because it &quot;so often has two characters working together in the frame&quot;. During pre-production, Biziou, Lyne and production designer Brian Morris used a collection of still photographs as style references. These included photos from fashion magazines and shots by prominent photographers.

===Filming===
Initially, the story was set against snowy exteriors, but this idea was rejected early on. Principal photography began in New York City on March 22, 2001 and wrapped on June 1, 2001 with Lyne shooting in continuity whenever possible. During the windstorm sequence where Connie first meets Paul, it rained and Lyne used the overcast weather conditions for the street scenes. The director also preferred shooting practical interiors on location so that the actors could &quot;feel an intimate sense of belonging&quot;, Biziou recalls. The cinematographer also used natural light as much as possible.

At times, Lyne&#x27;s directing took its toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that &quot;makes the colors less contrasty, more muted&quot;. According to Biziou, &quot;The texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame&quot;. The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 hours a day and Gere remembers, &quot;Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections&quot;. Lane acquired an oxygen bottle in order to survive the rigorous schedule.

The film has many explicit sex scenes, including a tryst in a restaurant bathroom and a passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne&#x27;s repeated takes for these scenes were demanding for the actors, especially for Lane, who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the scenes. To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had the actors watch clips from &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;, and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. Lane and Martinez would also talk over the scenes in his trailer beforehand. Once on the set, they felt uncomfortable until several takes in. She said, &quot;My comfort level with it just had to catch up quickly if I wanted to be the actress to play it.&quot; Martinez was not comfortable with nudity. Lane said that Lyne would often shoot a whole magazine of film, &quot;so one take was as long as five takes. By the end, you&#x27;re physically and emotionally shattered.&quot;

Lane had not met Martinez before filming, and they did not get to know each other well during the shoot, mirroring the relationship between their characters. A full four weeks of the schedule was dedicated to the scenes in Paul&#x27;s loft, which was located on the third floor of a six-story building located on Greene Street. Biziou often used two cameras for the film&#x27;s intimate scenes to reduce the number of takes that had to be shot.

===Post-production===
Lyne shot five different endings to &quot;Unfaithful&quot; based on his experiences with &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, whose initial ending was rejected by the test audience. According to Lyne, he had some debate with the 20th Century Fox officials, who wanted to &quot;make the marriage gray, the sex bad. I fought that. I tried to explore the guilt, the jealousy—that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m interested in.&quot; The studio did not like the film&#x27;s &quot;enigmatic&quot; ending, which they felt failed to punish crimes committed by the characters. It imposed a &quot;particularly jarring &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; final line&quot;, which angered Gere.

Following negative reactions from test audiences, the studio reinstated the original ending; a few weeks before the film was to open in theaters, Lyne asked Gere and Lane to return to Los Angeles for reshoots of the ending. Lyne claimed that the new ending was more ambiguous than the original and was the original one by screenwriter Alvin Sargent. Lyne also thought the new ending &quot;would be more interesting and provoke more discussion&quot;, saying he intentionally &quot;wanted to do a more ambiguous ending, which treats the audience much more intelligently&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Unfaithful&quot; was released in 2,617 theaters in the United States on May 10, 2002, grossing US$14 million on its first weekend, with an average of $5,374 per screen, ranking in second place behind &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. It made $52 million in the U.S. and Canada, and a total of $119 million worldwide, well above its $50 million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 50% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Diane Lane shines in the role, but the movie adds nothing new to the genre and the resolution is unsatisfying.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.

CNN film critic Paul Tatara wrote, &quot;The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times, and that&#x27;s a bad sign when they&#x27;re supposed to be having a collective heart attack.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an &quot;A−&quot; grade and praised Lane for delivering &quot;the most urgent performance of her career&quot;, writing that she &quot;is a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie&#x27;s real story.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Instead of pumping up the plot with recycled manufactured thrills, it&#x27;s content to contemplate two reasonably sane adults who get themselves into an almost insoluble dilemma.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The only performer who manages to get inside her character is Lane. Whether it&#x27;s her initial half-distrustful tentativeness, her later sensual abandon or her never-ending ambivalence, Lane&#x27;s Constance seems to be actually living the role in a way no one else matches, a way we can all connect to.&quot;

Stephen Holden in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the &quot;taut, economical screenplay&quot; that &quot;digs into its characters&#x27; marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four and Mike Clark wrote, &quot;Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979&#x27;s &quot;A Little Romance&quot;.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Stephen Hunter wrote, &quot;In the end, &quot;Unfaithful&quot; leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It&#x27;s an ill movie that bloweth no man to good.&quot; David Ansen, in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, wrote, &quot;&quot;Unfaithful&quot; shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It&#x27;s a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense of what goes on between a man and a woman, a husband and a wife.&quot; Andrew Sarris, in his review for the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, wrote, &quot;Ultimately &quot;Unfaithful&quot; is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there&#x27;s almost no humor,&quot; and concluded that it was &quot;one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups&quot;.

===Accolades===
The studio campaign&#x27;s theme consisted of what the studio called the film&#x27;s &quot;iconic scene&quot;: Constance recalling her first tryst with Paul as she takes a train home. According to Tom Rothman, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, &quot;That scene captured the power of her performance. It&#x27;s what everyone talked about after they saw her.&quot; Four days before the New York Film Critics Circle&#x27;s vote, Lane was given a career tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. A day before that, Lyne held a dinner for the actress at the Four Seasons Hotel. Critics and award voters were invited to both. Lane won the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle awards and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress, losing the latter to Nicole Kidman in &quot;The Hours&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Unfaithful&quot; the 27th on their &quot;50 Sexiest Movies Ever&quot; list.

<doc id="1126389" wikidata="Q5275361" url="?curid=1126389" title="Differential pulse voltammetry">
<text>Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (also differential pulse polarography, DPP) is a voltammetry method used to make electrochemical measurements and a derivative of linear sweep voltammetry or staircase voltammetry, with a series of regular voltage pulses superimposed on the potential linear sweep or stairsteps. The current is measured immediately before each potential change, and the current difference is plotted as a function of potential. By sampling the current just before the potential is changed, the effect of the charging current can be decreased.

By contrast, in normal pulse voltammetry the current resulting from a series of ever larger potential pulses is compared with the current at a constant &#x27;baseline&#x27; voltage. Another type of pulse voltammetry is squarewave voltammetry, which can be considered a special type of differential pulse voltammetry in which equal time is spent at the potential of the ramped baseline and potential of the superimposed pulse.

==Electrochemical cell==
The system of this measurement is usually the same as that of standard voltammetry. The potential between the working electrode and the reference electrode is changed as a pulse from an initial potential to an interlevel potential and remains at the interlevel potential for about 5 to 100 milliseconds; then it changes to the final potential, which is different from the initial potential. The pulse is repeated, changing the final potential, and a constant difference is kept between the initial and the interlevel potential. The value of the current between the working electrode and auxiliary electrode before and after the pulse are sampled and their differences are plotted versus potential.

==Uses==
These measurements can be used to study the redox properties of extremely low concentrations of chemicals because of the following two features: 1) in these measurements, the effect of the charging current can be minimized, so high sensitivity is achieved and 2) only faradaic current is extracted, so electrode reactions can be analyzed more precisely.

==Characteristics==
Differential pulse voltammetry has these characteristics: 1) reversible reactions have symmetric peaks, and irreversible reactions have asymmetric peaks, 2) the peak potential is equal to E1/2r-ΔE in reversible reactions, and the peak current is proportional to the concentration, 3) The detection limit is about 10−8 M.

<text>The location of Hong Kong, adjacent to the coast, is not close to the system of major rivers in southern China, though the water to the west of Hong Kong is influenced by Pearl River. In 1,103 km2 of land, the territory is largely hilly with over 200 islands. Because of this, the terrain can nurture relatively shorter and smaller rivers in Hong Kong than in southern China.

Historically, these rivers once sustained intensive farming for the need of population before the age of developing new towns. Many rivers can be found in the New Territories, especially in the areas north of Tai Mo Shan, where rice growing and fish farming were once everywhere amidst several river systems.

<doc id="1126401" wikidata="Q18967" url="?curid=1126401" title="Van Wilder">
<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder (also known as Van Wilder: Party Liaison in certain countries) is a 2002 romantic comedy film directed by Walt Becker in his directional debut and written by Brent Goldberg and David T. Wagner. The film stars Ryan Reynolds as the title character, alongside Tara Reid, Tim Matheson, and Paul Gleason.

The film follows the misadventures of its lead character, Van Wilder, a seventh-year senior who has made it his life goal to help undergrads at Coolidge College succeed in the future. After an article is written about his legacy by fellow student, Gwen Pearson (played by Reid), Van Wilder&#x27;s party lifestyle is brought to light. This attracts the attention of Wilder&#x27;s father, played by Matheson, who cuts off his tuition. Wilder becomes stuck in the middle of a love triangle between Gwen and her mean-spirited boyfriend, Richard Bagg while struggling to graduate. He tries various schemes to earn enough money to pay his tuition and graduate, with help from Gwen and the rest of the student body, except for a couple of sinister enemies who attempt to sabotage his efforts.

The film received mostly negative reviews from critics but was popular with audiences. The film grossed $21,305,259 at the US box office; $16,970,224 at the international box office; and $38,275,483 overall, thus making it a box-office success.

A sequel, &quot;Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj&quot;, was released on December 1, 2006. A prequel, &quot;Van Wilder: Freshman Year&quot;, was released straight-to-DVD on July 14, 2009.

The movie was loosely inspired by a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article featuring comedian Bert Kreischer.

==Plot==
Vance &quot;Van&quot; Wilder is a confident and sardonic seventh-year senior at Coolidge College who spends his days driving around campus in his customized golf cart, posing nude for figure drawing classes, and organizing soirees and fundraisers for his peers. His father severs financial support upon learning that his son is still in school.

Van seeks a payment extension from the registrar, Deloris Haver. After having sex with her, she hands him the paperwork for an extension, whereupon Van realizes he only needed to ask for it.

After a couple of attempts to get money fast, Van is approached by the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity, offering to pay him $1000 to throw them a blowout party to boost their popularity. Gwen Pearson, a reporter for the school paper, writes a story crediting Van as the party&#x27;s host. Van, who usually refuses to do interviews for the paper, realizes the article can be the &quot;cash cow&quot; he needs to stay in school and agrees to sit down with Gwen for a follow-up piece.

Gwen&#x27;s boyfriend, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Bagg, is a pre-med student and the president of his fraternity Delta Iota Kappa, as well as of the student government. As he learns of Gwen&#x27;s work with Van, suspecting a growing bond between them, he moves to sabotage their prospective romance.

Van and Richard exchange escalating pranks. Gwen learns that Van stopped attending classes years ago, 18 credits short of graduation. Angry that she dug into such personal details, he disassociates himself from her, taking a contemplative look at his life.

Richard arranges to sabotage Van&#x27;s latest party with Jeannie, a member of a sister sorority, by smuggling children in and getting them drunk, then calling campus police to the scene. Van is arrested for providing alcohol to minors and faces expulsion from Coolidge. He prepares to leave the college until his friend Taj inspires him to fight the charges.

Van throws himself at the mercy of the court, asking that rather than expelling him, they force him to graduate. He offers to complete his remaining credits before the semester ends, earning a degree in leisure studies. The academic board votes 3–2 in favor of Van&#x27;s reinstatement; Professor McDougal&#x27;s was the decisive vote for reinstatement, surprisingly. Van begins studying for the finals, which will be held in six days.

Outside the court, Jeannie reveals Richard&#x27;s plot to Gwen and his infidelity. Angered by this, Gwen pretends to forgive Richard and then spikes his protein shake with a powerful laxative just before his entrance exam to Northwestern Medical School. While taking the exam, Richard begins to have uncontrollable flatulence and hurries down the line with his exam, not even reading the questions due to his dire need for release.

As he rushes to the bathroom, Richard is intercepted by his future alumni, intending to interview him for his entrance. Unable to hold it in any longer, Richard drops his pants and proceeds to defecate violently in a wastebasket in front of the doctors, much to their horror and disgust.

Van uses the entire exam period for his last final with his least favorite professor, Prof. McDougal, who later delivers the news to him that he passed. McDougal explains that he had been so harsh on Van all those years because he believed that he was not living up to his potential, not because he had also hooked up with McDougal&#x27;s daughter freshman year.

Gwen finishes her article on Van for the graduation issue. In it, she reveals his many contributions to the students and staff of Coolidge in the last seven years, his superhuman accomplishment of doing a semester&#x27;s worth of studying in just six days, and Richard&#x27;s plot to have him expelled. Both Richard&#x27;s reputation and medical school dreams are permanently tarnished.

The university celebrates Van&#x27;s graduation with a wild party in his honor. After reading Gwen&#x27;s article, his father admits that he was wrong and expresses his pride in Van&#x27;s success. Gwen arrives, lovingly reuniting with Van.

<text>Club Deportivo Marathón is a Honduran professional football club based in San Pedro Sula. Founded on 25 November 1925, Marathón currently plays in the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional de Honduras.

==History==

Club Deportivo Marathón was founded on 25 November 1925 in San Pedro Sula by Eloy Montes and a group of his friends. Ever since, Marathón has become one of the most prestigious clubs in Honduras, winning multiple titles. Club Deportivo Marathón has its own sporting venue that has different fields for the first team all the way to the lower youth levels, and even a tennis cement based foosball lit for night games. The venue has since improved through the years by the support of Friends of the Marathón Group (GAMA) and the different boards of directors through the years.

===First title (1979)===
The club would win its first title in 1979, under the orders of Ángel Ramón Rodríguez. With figures like Roberto Bailey, Arturo Bonilla, Francisco Javier Toledo, Celso Güity, Efraín Osorio, Ramón Osorio, René Suazo, Jorge Alberto Bueso, Félix Carranza, Jorge Phoyoú, Alberto Merelles, and Juan Carlos Wéber among others, the club remained in first place in the regular season standings. Having secured their classification to the final, &quot;El Monstruo Verde&quot; defeated Pumas UNAH 2–0 over two legs.

===Second title (1985)===
It took six years for Marathón to win another championship. This was achieved in 1985. At that time, Gonzalo Zelaya of La Ceiba was the team coach. In the regular season, Marathón was second in their group behind C.D. Olimpia on goal difference. In the final round, Marathón was the champion with 4 wins, 1 draw and only 1 loss to rivals: Vida, Motagua and Olimpia. In the deciding match in San Pedro Sula at the Estadio Francisco Morazán, Marathón faced off with Vida. With a goal from Roy Padilla Bardales, the emerald outfit won 1–0 and was crowned league champion for the second time.

===Third title (2002)===

Marathón had a drought of nearly 17 years without a league title. However, at the beginning of the new century, the club began having a resurgence. This is due to that, in 2001, the Honduran coach Chelato Uclés, began a major renovation project. Forming a team without many big name players, Uclés led Marathón to the top once again, establishing &quot;El Monstruo Verde&quot; as one of the strongest teams in the league. Uclés led the team went to the Apertura final, losing against Motagua on penalties (5–3). However, the great work of Marathón was applauded and recognized by several journalists, hobbyists and technicians in the country for their offensive and attractive football. In the Clausura season, Marathón finished third in the regular season with 29 points, and faced Platense in the semifinals. In the first leg, Marathón won 2–1 in San Pedro Sula, with a brace from Enrique Reneau, while Platense pulled one back with a goal from Clifford Laing. In the second leg, Marathón drew 0–0 at Puerto Cortés and qualified for the final. Marathón faced Olimpia in the final, who defeated Victoria 3–2 on aggregate in the semifinals. In the first leg played at the Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano, Marathón defeated Olimpia 4–1 with a penalty from Nigel Zúniga, and goals from Enrique Reneau and Óscar Vargas. In the second leg at Estadio Tiburcio Carías Andino, Olimpia won 1–0, but it wasn&#x27;t enough as Marathón won 4–2 on aggregate and secured a third league title.

===Fourth title (2003)===
Just after 13 months, Marathón would again win another title. In the Clausura tournament, the &quot;Esmeraldas&quot; were directed by the Brazilian Flavio Ortega. Ortega replaced the Argentine Miguel Angel Lemme, who left in the middle of the season. Flavio Ortega lifted the team to finally reach second place in the regular season (only surpassed by Olimpia). In the semi-finals, Marathón faced Real España. In the first leg both teams tied 1–1; Henry Jimenez scored first for Real España, but Pompilio Cacho drew level. Three days later in the return game, played at the Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano, both sides drew 1–1 once again. Marathón entered the final, having finished higher in the regular season standings. Marathón faced Motagua in the final, with The Motagüenses having eliminated Olimpia in the semifinals. The first leg of the final was played at the Estadio Tiburcio Carías Andino, and Marathón surprised to win 1–0 with a goal from Emil Martínez, who was later sent off. In the return leg, Marathón had a total number of 35,000 fans at the Olímpico Metropolitano, the second highest attendance record in the history of Liga Nacional. Motagua struck first with a goal from Luis Oseguera in the 39th minute, however Pompilio Cacho scored the equalizer at the end of the first half. In the second half, Marathón were up 2 by goals, both scored by Denilson Costa. With this, Marathón were champions for a fourth time.

===Fifth title (2004)===
The team won its fifth title in 2004. Former player Nicolás Suazo led Marathón against Olimpia. After winning the first game in San Pedro Sula, Marathón won the tie in extra-time thanks to two goals from Edgardo Simovic.

===Sixth title (2007)===
On 22 December 2007, Marathón won its sixth league title. Under the guidance of Manuel Keosseián, the club beat Motagua in San Pedro Sula by 2–0 score after a 0–0 draw on the first leg in Tegucigalpa. Mitchel Brown and Erick Scott scored the winning goals.

===Seventh title (2008)===
On 13 December 2008, Marathón won its seventh title in its history and the fifth one of the new century. With Keosseián again as the coach, the club beat Real España at the Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano by a 1–0 scoreline in the first leg. In the second leg, both teams finished in a 1–1 draw.

===Eighth title (2009)===
In the 2009–10 season, Marathón faced Olimpia in the Apertura final. Having lost 1–0 in the first leg in Tegucigalpa, &quot;Los Panzas Verdes&quot; won 2–0 in the second leg with goals from Guillermo Ramírez and Jerry Palacios.

===Ninth title (2018)===
On 19 May 2018, Marathón was crowded a ninth time. Marathón faced Motagua and having finished 1–1 over two legs, Marathón came out victorious 5–4 on penalties. Under the guidance of the coach Hector Vargas, the club maintained their composure during the entire season.

==Stadium==
Marathón plays its home games in Estadio Yankel Rosenthal, which is located in San Pedro Sula. Marathón is the only team in Honduras to have its own stadium. Yankel Rosenthal is a multi-purpose stadium located in Colonia La Sabana in San Pedro Sula, Honduras has a capacity of 7,000 fans. The project, which was scheduled to be completed in full for 2007, was postponed to 2009 due to financial problems.

This event created the National Classic.

===Clásico Sampedrano===

El Clásico Sampedrano (The Sampedran Derby) is contested between Marathón and Real C.D. España. These two teams are from San Pedro Sula, hence the name.

As of 31 December 2020, Marathón is ranked at 384 out of 400, sitting behind Shanghai Shenhua F.C. of the Chinese Super League.

<text>Juan Negrín López (; 3 February 1892 – 12 November 1956) was a Spanish physician and politician who served as prime minister of the Second Spanish Republic. He was a leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, PSOE) and of the left-leaning Popular Front government during the Spanish Civil War. He also served as finance minister. He was the last Loyalist premier of Spain (1937–1939), leading the Republican forces defeated by the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco. He was President of the Council of Ministers of the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Republican government in exile between 1937 and 1945. He died in exile in Paris, France.

None of the leaders of the Second Spanish Republic has been as vilified as Negrín, not only by Francoist historians but also by important sectors of the exiled Spanish Left. The leaders of his own Socialist Party were among his detractors, including his friend and fellow socialist leader Indalecio Prieto. He has been depicted as primarily responsible for losing the civil war, leading with a dictatorial style, selling Spain out to the communist Soviet Union, and robbing the Spanish treasury. 

According to the historian Stanley G. Payne, after the end of the civil war there was no person more hated than Negrín. More recent scholarship, like the work of Negrin&#x27;s biographer Gabriel Jackson, dispelled most of these accusations. According to Jackson, Negrín was a pragmatic, social democratic leader who allied with the Soviets to keep the Republican cause alive until the outbreak of a world war, which would grant Republican Spain more allies in Western Europe. The PSOE expelled Negrín in 1946, but he was posthumously rehabilitated in 2008.

==Early years==
Born in Las Palmas on the Canary Islands, Negrín came from a deeply Catholic middle-class family. His father, Juan Negrin Cabrera, was a prosperous and reputable merchant and businessman of the islands, married to María Dolores López Marrero. Juan was the firstborn son and had one brother Heriberto, who adhered to the Claretian order, and a sister Dolores.
Since Juan had excelled in science subjects and had shown an interest in medicine, his father decided to send him, at the age of 15, to study in Germany in 1906, attracted by the enormous prestige of German universities at the time.

===In Germany===
Negrin studied for two years at the Medical Faculty of Kiel. In 1908, to specialize in medical physiology, he moved to Leipzig, to the best physiology institute of Germany and even in Europe. He stayed in Germany for almost a decade, studying first medicine, then chemistry and to some extent, economics. He proved to be a brilliant student with extraordinary capacity for scientific research. In 1912 (when he was only twenty years old) under the guidance of Theodor von Brücke he obtained a doctorate in medicine and was immediately incorporated into the Institute of Physiology in Leipzig as a research assistant and then as an assistant professor.

On 21 July 1914 he married María Fidelman Brodsky, a piano student and daughter of a wealthy family of Russian exiles living in the Netherlands. The couple had five children, three of whom survived: Juan, Rómulo, and Miguel. Negrín spoke English, French, German, and Russian, in addition to his native Spanish.

===Back to Spain===
At the end of 1915, in the middle of the First World War, the increasing difficulties he encountered in Germany to continue working prompted Negrin to return to Spain. He already had a solid professional prestige guaranteed by his research on the adrenal glands and the central nervous system and by a remarkable series of articles published in the best scientific journals in Europe. He was a pupil of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who won the Nobel Prize of Medicine. In 1919 he obtained his medical degree in Spain, and in 1922 he became a professor of physiology at the Physiology Department at the Complutense University of Madrid Medical School at the age of 29. His physiology laboratory in Madrid became an internationally renowned research centre and a truly exceptional school of scientific training. Among the many students he inspired was Severo Ochoa, winner of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine:

Negrin opened wide, fascinating vistas to my imagination, not only through his lectures and laboratory teaching, but through his advice, encouragement, and stimulation to read scientific monographs and textbooks in languages other than Spanish.

According to Ochoa, Negrín was a demanding tutor and a high proportion of students failed his exams. He also set up a private laboratory that was very successful. In 1923, his youngest daughter died in childbirth, which Negrín himself attended. Two years later, his other daughter died at the age of ten as a result of a typhus epidemic. These misfortunes would lead to the estrangement of the marriage and the entry into Negrín&#x27;s life of Feliciana López de Dom Pablo, one of his laboratory assistants, who would become his companion in 1926 until his death. His wife did not tolerate this relationship and attributed permanent affairs to him.

===In politics===

During his stay in Germany, Negrin had become very close to German social democracy, then at one of the moments of its maximum height and socio-political and cultural influence, but far removed from his conservative family tradition. Negrín joined the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) in the spring of 1929, at the height of the crisis of the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera and the monarchy of Alfonso XIII. He aligned himself from the very beginning with the moderate and reformist faction headed by Indalecio Prieto – with whom he forged a close friendship that only broke down due to the civil war – and opposed to the one led by Francisco Largo Caballero, representing the left (Marxist and revolutionary) wing of the UGT trade union and the PSOE. From 1930 onwards, he declined his academic activity in favour of politics, and in 1934 he requested a leave of absence from his professorship. In the 1931 Spanish general election he was elected deputy for Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, and re-elected in 1933 and 1936.

Between April 1931 and July 1936, as political tension and social polarisation increased in Spain, Negrín identified in the socialist movement with Prieto&#x27;s moderate positions and firmly opposed to the radical tendency led by Largo Caballero. The moderate faction of the PSOE, the majority in the executive committee, was in favour of maintaining the coalition with Prime Minister Manuel Azaña&#x27;s Republicans in order to complete the ambitious programme of social democratic political and social reforms that had been launched by the left-wing government between 1931 and 1933 (secularisation of the state, agrarian reform, administrative decentralisation, military reform, progressive labour legislation, etc.). According to Prieto, Negrín and their supporters, this republican-socialist conjunction was essential to successfully promote the reforms and overcome the double opposition offered by the possible reaction of the right-wing defenders of the status quo with the help of the army and by the also possible revolution of the anarcho-syndicalist or communist-inspired workers&#x27; left.

In Spanish socialism he represented a clear option of republicanism and centrism, identifiable with the political position of his friend Indalecio Prieto. With regard to the revolutionary general strike of 1934 – against the appointment of three ministers of the conservative Catholic Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights (, CEDA) to the right-wing government of Alejandro Lerroux – sponsored by Largo Caballero, Negrín opted for the option of republican unity advocated by Prieto as opposed to the revolutionary project put forward by Largo Caballero, which caused him to distance himself from Luis Araquistain and led to an irreparable split within Spanish socialism. The events of 1934, in particular the uprising in Asturias, were a prelude to the civil war.

==Spanish Civil War==

After the military uprising in Morocco on 17 July 1936, Spain was rapidly divided in two: a &quot;Republican&quot; or &quot;Loyalist&quot; Spain consisting of the Second Spanish Republic, and a &quot;Nationalist&quot; Spain under the insurgent generals, and, eventually, under the leadership of General Francisco Franco. The Republic faced tremendous odds from the outset, including the Nationalist military superiority, internal divisions, and European non-intervention.

The Non-Intervention Agreement, initiated by the French and the British governments, and signed in August 1936, in which European powers renounced all trade in war material, direct or indirect, effectively subjected the Spanish Republic to international isolation and a &quot;de facto&quot; economic embargo and placed the Republicand only the Republicat an enormous material disadvantage throughout the conflict. Italy and Germany supported the Spanish Nationalists from the outset of the Civil War. The Soviet Union began supporting the Republicans four months later.

From the first moment of the war, Negrin combined his activities as a deputy and, later, as a minister, with frequent visits in his private car to different places on the front line of Madrid to encourage the combatants and provide them with food and supplies. Negrín helped many people to escape from the revolutionary &quot;&quot; in July and August 1936. His personal courage in pursuit of this was attested to by a friend who recounted that he &quot;made every effort, at considerable risk to himself... to save people in Madrid.&quot; As a result, Negrin was nearly killed by anarchists but was saved by the intervention of finance ministry security staff.

===Minister of Finance===
 He was named Minister of Finance in September 1936 in the government of Largo Caballero. He only accepted the post out of party discipline, as he considered that Largo Caballero as Prime Minister gave an excessively radical image of the Republic to the outside world and was a serious political and diplomatic blunder that would make it impossible to obtain vital aid from France and Great Britain. As the finance minister, he built up the &quot;Carabineros&quot; (custom guards), a force of 20,000 men which was later nicknamed the &quot;Hundred Thousand Sons of Negrín&quot; (an allusion to the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis), in order to recover the control of the French frontier posts, which had been seized by the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT).

With the approval of President Azaña, Largo Caballero and other influential ministers (including Prieto), he took the controversial decision to transfer the Spanish gold reserves to the Soviet Union in return for arms and equipment urgently needed to continue the war (October 1936). Worth $500 million at the time (another $240 million had been sent to France in July), critics argued that this action put the Republican government under the control of Joseph Stalin.

===Prime minister===
The Barcelona May Days of 1937, when factions on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War engaged each other in street battles and anarchist and communist Republican soldiers fought for control of strategic points in Barcelona, led to a governmental crisis that forced Largo Caballero to resign. On 17 May 1937, President Manuel Azaña named Negrín the 135th Prime Minister of Spain, to end the indiscipline and disarray in the rearguard. Negrín&#x27;s government included Indalecio Prieto named minister of War, Navy and Air, Julián Zugazagoitia as minister of interior (both socialists), the communists Jesús Hernández Tomás as minister of education and Vicente Uribe as minister of agriculture, the republicans José Giral as foreign minister and Bernardo Giner de los Ríos as public works minister, the Basque Manuel Irujo as minister of justice and the Catalan Nationalist Jaume Aiguader as minister of labour. Negrín&#x27;s energetic and willful management, exemplified in his campaign slogan (&quot;resistir es vencer&quot;, &quot;to resist is to win&quot;), captured for a time the hopes and desires of the depressed and semi-despondent rearguard and revived the meagre forces of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces.

====Goals====
In the anarchist-controlled areas, Aragon and Catalonia, in addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast social revolution in which the workers and peasants collectivised land and industry, and set up councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government. Negrin&#x27;s main objectives were to fortify the central government, to reorganize and fortify the Republican Armed Forces and to impose law and order in the Republican-held area, against largely independent armed militias of the labour unions (CNT) and parties, thus curtailing the social revolution inside the Republic. He also wanted to break the international isolation of the Republic in order to get the arms embargo – imposed by the Non-Intervention Committee – lifted, and from 1938 to search an international mediation in order to finish the war. He also wished to normalize the position of the Catholic Church inside the Republic. Eventually, the &#x27;normalization&#x27; in Spain was intended to connect the Spanish conflict with Second World War, which he believed to be imminent, although the Munich Agreement between Hitler and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain on 30 September 1938 definitively made all hope of outside aid vanish.

====PCE&#x27;s support====
Although Negrín had always been a centrist in the PSOE, he maintained links with the Communist Party of Spain (, PCE), whose policies at that point were in favour of a Popular Front alignment. Negrín relied on the Communists to curtail the anarchist wing of the Spanish Left, and was forced to rely on the Soviet Union, then led by Stalin, for weapons and armament, because of the arms embargo. The government and the communists were able to exploit their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, through diplomacy and force. The militias of the anarchists and the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM) were integrated into the regular army, albeit with resistance. The POUM Trotskyists were outlawed and denounced by the Soviet-aligned Communists as an instrument of the fascists. Republican Spain needed the Soviet Union&#x27;s support because the Non-Intervention Agreement imposed on the conflict prevented the democratically elected government from acquiring arms and other war materiel in its own right on the open market arms to defend itself.

====Military situation====

On the military level, along 1937 he launched a series of offensives in June (Huesca and Segovia), July, Brunete and August, Belchite, in order to halt the Nationalist offensive in the North, but all failed and by October the Nationalists had occupied all of the Northern territory. Beginning December, he launched an offensive in order to free Teruel, but by February the Republican Army had to retreat after suffering heavy losses and the rebel faction launched a counter-offensive in Aragon, cutting in half the Republican-held zone. In July 1938 Negrín launched an offensive in order to cross the Ebro River and reconnect the two Republican-held zones. The Republican army managed to cross the Ebro, but by November had to retire after it suffered heavy casualties and lost most of its materiel. Finally, in February 1939, he ordered to launch an offensive in Extremadura to stop the Nationalists advancement in their offensive against Catalonia, but was halted after a few days and Catalonia fell.

====Home front====
The military situation of the Spanish Republic deteriorated steadily under Negrín&#x27;s government, largely because of the superior quality of the opposing generals and officers many of whom were veterans of the Rif War, and by 1938 the overwhelming advantage of the rebels in terms of men (20%), aircraft and artillery provided by Germany and Italy. The Munich Agreement effectively caused a collapse in Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers. Throughout 1938, the unremitting succession of serious military defeats and the failure to secure Franco-British aid, was reflected in a deterioration of material living conditions in the rear (especially in terms of food) that deeply affected the political morale of the popular and military resistance of the Republican side. Late 1938, the freezing and half starved civilian population in the Siege of Madrid was suffering from severe malnutrition due to the restricted daily ration of 100 grams of bread and lentils (nicknamed &quot;Dr Negrín’s pills&quot;). Disheartened by a fifth column, a war weariness took hold of Madrid and defeatism was widespread. 

====Peace negotiations====
 In May 1938, Negrín issued the &quot;Thirteen Points&quot; &quot;(Trece Puntos)&quot;, a program for peace negotiations, including absolute independence of Spain, liberty of conscience, protection of the regional liberties, universal suffrage, an amnesty for all Spaniards and agrarian reform, but Franco rejected any peace deal. Before the fall of Catalonia and the capture of Barcelona by the Nationalists on 26 January 1939, Negrín proposed, in the meeting of the Cortes in Figueres, capitulation with the sole condition of respecting the lives of the vanquished and the holding of a plebiscite so the Spanish people could decide the form of government, but Franco again rejected the new peace deal. On 9 February 1939, Negrín moved to the Central Zone (30% of the Spanish territory) with the intention of defending the remaining territory of the republic until the start of the general European conflict, and organize the evacuation of those most at risk. Negrín thought that there was no other course but resistance, because the Nationalists refused to negotiate any peace deal:

To fight on because there was no other choice, even if winning was not possible, then to salvage what we could – and at the very end our self respect... Why go on resisting? Quite simply because we knew what capitulation would mean.

The critical year of 1938 saw a rupture in the PSOE and the political and personal friendship between Negrín and Prieto. Prieto was removed from the Defence ministry for his defeatism and joined with Largo Caballero and Julián Besteiro (the leader of the PSOE right-wing faction) in denouncing the government&#x27;s policy as favourable to the communists and opposed to the idea of international mediation. Negrín explained his position to his friend and confidant Juan Simeón Vidarte:

Do you think this odious servitude does not weigh as heavily on me as on anyone else? But there is no other way. When I speak to our friends in France, it is all promises and good words. Then inconveniences begin to arise, and of what was promised there is nothing left. Nothing remains of what was promised. The only reality, however much it pains us, is to accept the help of the Soviet Union, or to surrender unconditionally. (...) What else can I do? Negotiated peace always; unconditional surrender so that half a million Spaniards will be shot, never.

====Casado&#x27;s coup====

After the fall of Barcelona, President Manuel Azaña had fled to France, where he resigned as President of the Republic on 3 March 1939. Colonel Segismundo Casado, joined by Besteiro, general José Miaja, Cipriano Mera and disillusioned anarchist leaderstired of fighting, which they regarded then as hopelessplanned a coup d&#x27;état. Seeking better surrender terms, they seized power in Madrid on 5 March 1939, created the National Defence Council &quot;(Consejo Nacional de Defensa)&quot;, and deposed Negrín. On 6 March, Negrín fled to France. Although the troops led by the PCE rejected the &quot;coup&quot; on Madrid they were defeated by Cipriano Mera&#x27;s troops. The uprising against the Negrín government succeeded, at the cost of nearly 2,000 lives. The Junta tried to negotiate a peace deal with the nationalists, but Franco only accepted an unconditional surrender of the Republic. Finally all the members of the Junta (except Besteiro) fled, and by 31 March 1939 the Nationalists seized all the Spanish territory.

==Exile and death==

Unlike President Azaña, Negrín remained in Spain until the final collapse of the Republican front and his fall from office in March 1939. Negrín decided to openly support the Franco-British war effort against Germany and Italy, remaining in Paris until the fall of France (June 1940) and then going to London. He resided there throughout the Second World War, repeatedly refusing to leave Europe and seek safe haven in Mexico, as did a large number of the Republican leadership. He organized the S.E.R.E. () to help Republican exiles. He remained prime minister of the Spanish Republican government in Exile between 1939 and 1945 (although ignored by most of the exiled political forces).

The Francoist dictatorship stripped Negrín of his academic position and confiscated his estate. In July 1941 he was sentenced to the exorbitant fine of 100 million pesetas by the Special Court of the Law of Political Responsibilities, while in September 1941, the Special Court for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism sentenced him to 30 years in prison (the maximum penalty, even though Negrin was neither a Mason nor a Communist). His father was imprisoned in Las Palmas for the mere fact of being his father, leaving prison in 1941 to die shortly thereafter in poverty after having been illegally expropriated of all his property.

===Disagreements with exile community===
In August 1945, at the end of the war with the defeat of the Axis powers, Negrin tried to gather the unanimous support of all the political forces in exile in order to offer a unitary republican front that could gather the support of the allied governments against Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, taking advantage of his international discredit and the strong rejection that his recent behaviour of sympathy and support for the Italian-German war effort had provoked. In Negrin&#x27;s opinion, only such a united front would serve as a guarantee before Washington and London of the presence of a replacement alternative to the Franco regime that did not run the risk of resuming the horrors of civil war. However, in view of the impossibility of gaining the support of all the political forces in exile, Negrín resigned from his position as head of the government of the Republic in exile before the plenary session of the Cortes in exile meeting in Mexico in August 1945. The PSOE expelled Negrín and a number of additional party members through a note published in &quot;El Socialista&quot; on 23 April 1946, before the celebration of a party congress in Toulouse.

To no avail, in 1948 Negrín spoke out in favour of Franco&#x27;s Spain&#x27;s participation in the post-war Marshall Plan, which was opposed by the Spanish Republican government in exile. In his opinion, the economic assistance to Spain was indispensable to the economic recovery of Europe, while its exclusion could have no other result than to increase further the sufferings of the Spanish people. According to Negrín, dreaming of the re-establishment of the Republic through hunger and the impoverishment of Spain was a mistake and mere flawed wishful thinking.

===Death and aftermath===
Negrín died from a heart attack in Paris on 12 November 1956 at the age of 64, and is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. After the death of Negrín, his son Rómulo Negrín, following the instructions of his father, handed over the so-called &quot;Negrín dossier&quot; – an incomplete series of documents related to the administration of the gold deposited in the Soviet Union – to the government of Francoist Spain in order to prove that it had been spent entirely for the Republican war effort. Negrín had refused to hand over documentation to the exiled Republican government for over 15 years. Willingly handing the documentation over to the Francoist authorities caused profound distress in the exile community. The Francoist authorities accepted the documentation, but publicly hushed up its content so as not to have to negate the propaganda myth of the Spanish gold stolen and squandered by the Republicans in Moscow.

==Legacy==
According to the historian Stanley G. Payne, after the end of the civil war there was no person more hated. Franco&#x27;s side considered him a &quot;red traitor&quot;, while within the Republican camp, some of his former allies reproached him for the &quot;useless&quot; prolongation of the war and for having &quot;served&quot; the plans of the Soviet Union. A New York Times editorial at the time of his death said: 

Gabriel Jackson&#x27;s biography depicts Negrín as &quot;a fundamentally honest and decent human being who sacrificed his health, reputation, and academic career in a failed attempt to save his country from disaster,&quot; and as &quot;an accomplished scientist and cosmopolitan intellectual who in normal circumstances would have never had to become a politician, let alone take his country’s reins during the most difficult years of its long history.&quot; Jackson was a staunch defender of Negrín. &quot;Negrín was one of those rare prepared politicians, with character; very valuable for his time,&quot; he said. According to Jackson: 

Negrín was one of the most controversial characters of the Spanish Civil War. &quot;Demonized or praised, Negrin has been considered both a faithful servant of the permanent communist conspiracy in the pay of Moscow, and the most loyal politician to the Republican cause because of his faith in the final triumph, or he has been defined as a kind of seer who knew how to predict the inexorability of the Second World War, so that his policy of resistance at all costs (&quot;resistir es vencer&quot;, &quot;to resist is to win&quot;) would have led to the victory of the Republic, if the Spanish war had lasted five more months,&quot; say Spanish historians Ángel Bahamonde Magro and Javier Cervera Gil. Negrín was post-humously rehabilitated by the PSOE in 2008.

In 2010, a Spanish documentary film, &quot;Ciudadano Negrín&quot; (Citizen Negrín), directed by Sigfrid Monleón, Imanol Uribe and Carlos Álvarez Pérez was released. The documentary reconstructs the life of Juan Negrín from a variety of sources, including his grandchildren Carmen and Juan. With the help of historians such as Gabriel Jackson and Ángel Viñas, the film aims to give the protagonist a voice, using his writings, speeches and letters to construct the story. The production also benefits from the discovery of home movies filmed by Negrín himself in exile. In 2013, Negrín&#x27;s granddaughter Carmen Negrín handed over 150,000 original documents that he had transferred to France in several shipments to save them from destruction. The use and custody of the legacy rests with the Juan Negrín Foundation, a non-profit organization founded in Las Palmas, on his home island of Gran Canaria, in 1992.

<doc id="1126429" wikidata="Q713077" url="?curid=1126429" title="Fort Santo Domingo">
<text>Fort Santo Domingo is a historical fortress in Tamsui District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. It was originally a wooden fort built in 1628 by the Manila-based Spanish East Indies of the Spanish Empire, who named it in . However, after refurbishing it in stone, the initial fort was repeatedly ordered to be dismantled and withdrawn from around 1637 by Spanish Governor-General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera for economic downsizing and retrenchment, which their rival Dutch East India Company (VOC) of the Dutch Empire soon found out and later invaded in 1641 and won by the Second Battle of San Salvador in 1642. After the battle, the Dutch rebuilt a fort in the original site in 1644 and renamed it in , after Antonio van Diemen, the then Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Since the Dutch were called in Taiwanese Hokkien ) by the Han Chinese immigrants during the time, the fort was then nicknamed in Taiwanese Hokkien .

In 1724, the Qing Government repaired the fort, and built a perimeter wall with four gates. From 1868 onwards the fort was leased to the British government as its consulate, and a new two-storey building was built nearby as the consul&#x27;s residence. The fort continued to be used as a British consulate during Japanese rule, but was briefly closed during the Pacific War.

After the war, it was returned to British control. The site was used as an unofficial British embassy until 1972, though official diplomatic relations between Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom were terminated in 1950. Afterwards the fort was temporarily managed by Australia and the United States of America, before the fort was returned to the government of Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1980. Since then, the fort has been a National Historical Site, open to tourists and archaeologists alike. It is considered a potential World Heritage Site.

The site of Fort Santo Domingo includes the main fortress, the former British consul&#x27;s residence, and the south gate built during Qing dynasty. Among the architectures, the main fortress is one of the oldest buildings on the whole island, and there were four cannons placed in the front of the fortress, which could be traced back to Jiaqing era. The former British consul&#x27;s residence is on the east side of the main fortress, and is a two-storey English-style building. The south gate is the only Chinese style architecture among all the buildings, and is made from Guangin Stones.

Fort Santo Domingo is located near Hobe Fort, which was built during the late Qing era.

==History==

===Spanish Era===

After the Spanish established a permanent colony at San Salvador (Palm Island; modern-day Hoping Island), they proceeded in 1629 to occupy Tamsui, &quot;which even at this early period was frequented by many Chinese merchants, who came from Fokien to barter with the Formosa natives.&quot; On a night in 1636, a group of local people, angered by the taxes that the Spanish governor had imposed, successfully attacked the fort and demolished it. In 1637, the Spanish rebuilt the fort using stone and raised the walls&#x27; height to twenty feet or more. A church was also built on a hill, and the locals helped to make a road to it from the fort. &quot;Peter Nuits the Dutch Governor of Formosa, reported these facts to his home authorities and exposed in an interesting report the injury that the Spaniards were doing to Dutch trade and the necessity of sending an expedition to drive them away.&quot;

Owing to economic downturn affecting the Spanish Empire (during the last years of the Iberian Union) around the 1630s to 1640s, shrinking revenues and rising defense costs and the Spanish East Indies&#x27;s armies and resources spread thin on multiple fronts with multiple enemies (e.g. Johor Sultanate, Maguindanao Sultanate, Dutch East India Company as part of the Dutch-Portuguese War), the Spanish Governor-Generals of the time saw the Spanish presence in Taiwan as a drain on resources and personnel. Governor-General Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera would write letters in 1636 to King Philip IV: &quot;That the enemy [Dutch East India Company] maintains a post [in Formosa] does not at all embarrass or hinder the Crown of Castile, for the Chinese do not fail to come in twenty-four hours to the forts of Your Majesty that are on this side of the sea [i.e., Manila], bringing the necessary merchandise and supplies. That island, Sire, is of very little use to your Majesty, and it serves only to consume a large part of the revenues.&quot; Rather than waiting for the king&#x27;s response, Corcuera convened a war council proposing to abandon Spanish Formosa or withdraw some of its forces, as it was then deemed as a waste of soldiers, money, and food supplies, as shipments directly arriving to Spanish Manila brought by Chinese merchant ships was deemed more economical, ideally plying the route from Portuguese Macau rather than going near Dutch Formosa that the Portuguese and Spanish as part of the Iberian Union were at war with in the Dutch-Portuguese War. Nearly all members of the war council agreed but Governor-General Corcuera forgoed advising the king on the matter and ordered the governor of Spanish Formosa to send a force to punish the natives who attacked Fort Santo Domingo in 1636 to make sure any withdrawal of manpower and abandonment of the fort did not show fear of the natives, then the governor was to withdraw all artillery and soldiers and dismantle it entirely to take back to the main fort in Keelung and downsize most all manpower and resources back to Manila, leaving only 125 soldiers in Keelung. The governor in Keelung was reluctant to carry this order out since he had just renovated Fort Santo Domingo with stone, so it appears that he did not dismantle the fort, but at least brought back most of the personnel in October 24, 1637 back to the Philippines. Corcuera got mad at him and reappointed a new governor repeating his previous order to dismantle Fort Santo Domingo and withdraw all forces to Keelung with the previous governor later being exiled to Ternate for his disobedience. The new governor followed through on dismantling Fort Santo Domingo, except leaving a small redoubt guarding an entrance to Keelung. Corcuera ordered more forces to be recalled from Formosa and reduced the yearly supply ships from Manila to Formosa from two to one.

With the remaining force in Keelung, Spanish authority beyond Keelung collapsed as the natives of Tamsui believed that the Spanish left out of fear &quot;because those who had until then lived in a fortress of cane and wood now did not even dare to be in one of stone.&quot; The Spanish friars who used to live outside the forts and ventured far from military outposts were now afraid to leave the fort in Keelung and the paths between Tamsui and Keelung were now dangerous even for a group of armed Spaniards. Fewer Chinese merchant ships arrived as well and the few who arrived found that the Spanish force in Keelung had no money anymore to buy from them. What little money was left was used to strengthen the fort in Keelung. The Spanish friars in Keelung sent letters to Manila to lobby to invest more in Formosa, which the friars of Manila urged the Governor-General, but Corcuera repeatedly refused to the point that he would use Formosa as a place of exile for one of his enemies.

Rumors soon reached the Dutch through the Chinese merchant ships telling them that the Spanish intended to abandon Formosa entirely, just waiting for permission from their king. The Dutch who had heard of reports of gold mines in the northeast of Formosa felt they could not go prospecting until the Spanish presence was removed. The Dutch learned more of the Spanish situation from Chinese merchants, which later in April 1641, they allowed a Chinese merchant to send two junk ships from the Bay of Tayouan (Anping, Tainan, Dutch Formosa) to Tamsui to buy sulfur, but at the same time carrying Dutch soldiers and a VOC official, which were welcomed in Tamsui. A small group of Dutch soldiers also surveyed the east coast of Formosa and arrived within about 30km of Keelung. In August 1641, the Dutch sailed to the Bay of Keelung, studying the Spanish situation.

After a failed first attempt in 1641, the Dutch made a second expedition on 3 August 1642: &quot;the Dutch appeared off Tamsui with a comparatively powerful squadron of four frigates, a large cutter, nine small vessels, besides several transports...&quot; After the Dutch mounted artillery at an elevation commanding the fort, they succeeded in taking the fort on 24 August. The Dutch also expelled the Spaniards from nearby Keelung. The Spanish fort in Tamsui had by then already been razed by the Spanish themselves. It is also claimed that no traces remain of the forts on Palm Island, as they were destroyed by Zheng Jing, son of Koxinga.

===Dutch era===
The Dutch then became the &quot;undisputed masters of Formosa&quot;, and built a new fort on the site with the intention to maintain the trade of sulfur and deer skin, while also deploying vessels in the Tamsui River to protect the trading zone. The fort was named as Fort Antonio, with the name of Governors-General of the Dutch East Indies, Anthony van Diemen, during the time.

In 1644, they replaced it with the structure still standing today, also called Fort Antonio. The &quot;Old Dutch Fort&quot; made of brick and stone has been described as &quot;impregnable against any engines of war that those early days could produce.&quot;

The locals called the Dutch &quot;the red-haired people&quot;, which led to the compound&#x27;s Hokkien name ().
===Qing era===
From 1683 to 1867 the Qing Dynasty Chinese government controlled the fort and during this time (1724) built a stone wall with four gates around it, of which only one, the main gate, survives.
 
Following the Second Opium War, in 1868 the British took over the fort, made it their trade consulate, and painted it red (it was previously white). The fort was struck during the 1884 French bombardment of the Battle of Tamsui but suffered no damage. The linguist Herbert Allen Giles resided in the fort from 1885 to 1888 and completed some of his work on the Wade-Giles system of romanization of Standard Chinese there. Next to the fort the British built their consular residence in 1891.

The Fort is adjacent to Aletheia University, which traces its origins back to 1872 when the Reverend Dr. George Leslie Mackay, a Canadian Presbyterian, established a mission and then a medical service and a school.

===Modern era===
The consulate closed during World War II and reopened after the end of the war. The premises remained as the British consulate in Taiwan until 1972, when the United Kingdom recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It then served as the Australian embassy in Taiwan for a few months, until that nation also recognized the PRC. Aletheia University then attempted to acquire the fort, but no deal was reached by the time negotiations ended in 1978. The government of the Republic of China terminated the lease in 1980, taking ownership of the fort by 30 June. It was opened to tourists on 25 December 1984.

The fort is classified as a grade one listed historical site and is now a museum with the interior recreated from photographs. In 2003, maintenance of the site was entrusted to the Taipei County Government from the Ministry of the Interior. It was reopened after refurbishment in 2005.

==Tourist information==
The fort and the former British consular residence, an elegant Victorian house fused with some Chinese elements, now function as a museum. The location provides a beautiful outlook on the Tamsui River and Guanyin Mountain. 

The fort is open to the public Tuesday – Sunday, 9am – 5pm. There is an NT$80 charge for admission, with some exceptions.

==Transport==
The fort is accessible within walking distance North West from Tamsui Station of the Taipei Metro.

<doc id="1126432" wikidata="Q1365583" url="?curid=1126432" title="Bad debt">
<text>In finance, bad debt, occasionally called uncollectible accounts expense, is a monetary amount owed to a creditor that is unlikely to be paid and for which the creditor is not willing to take action to collect for various reasons, often due to the debtor not having the money to pay, for example due to a company going into liquidation or insolvency. A high bad debt rate is caused when a business is not effective in managing its credit and collections process. If the credit check of a new customer is not thorough or the collections team is not proactively reaching out to recover payments, a company faces the risk of a high bad debt. Various technical definitions exist of what constitutes a bad debt, depending on accounting conventions, regulatory treatment and institution provisioning. In the United States, bank loans with more than ninety days&#x27; arrears become &quot;problem loans&quot;. Accounting sources advise that the full amount of a bad debt be written off to the profit and loss account or a provision for bad debts as soon as it is foreseen.

==Doubtful debt==

Doubtful debts are those debts which a business or individual is unlikely to be able to collect. The reasons for potential non-payment can include disputes over supply, delivery, the condition of the item, or the appearance of financial stress within a customer&#x27;s operations. When such a dispute occurs, it is prudent to add this debt or portion thereof to the doubtful debt reserve. This is done to avoid over-stating the assets of the business as trade debtors are reported net of doubtful debt. When there is no doubt that a debt is uncollectible, the debt becomes bad. An example of a debt becoming uncollectible would be: once final payments have been made from the liquidation of a customer&#x27;s limited liability company, no further action can be taken.

==Doubtful debt reserve==
Also known as a &quot;bad debt reserve&quot;, this is a contra account listed within the current asset section of the balance sheet. The doubtful debt reserve holds a sum of money to allow a reduction in the accounts receivable ledger due to non-collection of debts. This can also be referred to as an allowance for bad debts. Once a doubtful debt becomes uncollectible, the amount will be written off.

==Accounting practices ==

===United States===
In financial accounting and finance, bad debt is the portion of receivables that can no longer be collected, typically from accounts receivable or loans. Bad debt in accounting is considered an expense.

There are two methods to account for bad debt:
# Direct write off method (Non-GAAP): a receivable that is not considered collectible is charged directly to the income statement.
# Allowance method (GAAP): an estimate is made at the end of each fiscal year of the amount of bad debt. This is then accumulated in a provision that is then used to reduce specific receivable accounts as and when necessary.
#*Allowance for bad debts are amounts expected to be uncollected but that are still possible to be collected (when there is no other possibility for collection, they are considered uncollectible accounts). For example, if gross receivables are US$100,000 and the amount that is expected to remain uncollected is $5,000, net receivables will be US$95,000.

The matching principle of accounting calls for revenues and expenses to be recorded in the period in which they are incurred. When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called &quot;allowance for doubtful accounts&quot;. At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from allowance for doubtful accounts.

====Taxability====
Some types of bad debts, whether business or non-business-related, are considered tax deductible. Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code provides the requirements for which a bad debt to be deducted.

====Section 166====
Section 166 limits the amount of the deduction. There must be an amount of tax capital, or basis, in question to be recovered. In other words, there is an adjusted basis for determining a gain or loss for the debt in question.

An additional factor in applying the criteria is the classification of the debt (non-business of business).

====Business bad debts ====
Business bad debts are debts closely related to your business or trade. They are created or gained through transactions directly or closely related to your business or trade. A loss from a business bad debt occurs once the debt acquired or gained has become wholly or partly worthless.

Bad business debt examples include:

* Credit sales to customers
* Loans to clients, suppliers, distributors, and employees
* Business loan guarantees

When deducting a business bad debt, the deduction is figured through the taxable income that is based on your business&#x27;s full or partial gross income.

====Nonbusiness bad debts====
Nonbusiness bad debts are all other debts that are not business bad debts. To deduct a nonbusiness bad debt, it has to be completely worthless. A debt becomes worthless when it is reasonable to believe it will never be repaid after you have taken the steps to collect it. The deduction can only be taken in the year that the debt is determined to be worthless.

====Mortgage bad debt====
Mortgages that may be non-collectible can be written off as bad debt as well. However, they fall under a slightly different set of rules. As stated above, they can only be written off against tax capital, or income, but they are limited to a deduction of $3,000 per year. Any loss above that can be carried over to the following years at the same amount. Thus a $60,000 mortgage bad debt will take 20 years to write off. Most owners of junior (2nd, 3rd, etc.) fall into this when the 1st mortgage forecloses with no equity remaining to pay on the junior liens.

There is one option available for mortgages not available for the business debt: donation. The difference is that a valuation of $10,000 can be taken without an appraisal. An appraisal may be able to increase the value to more and must be based on other similar mortgages that actually sold, but generally it is less than the face value. The real difference is that as a donation the amount of deduction is limited to up to 50% of adjusted gross income per year with carryovers taken over the next five years. This is because the deduction is now classified as a donation instead of a bad debt write off and uses Schedule A instead of Schedule D. This can significantly increase the current year&#x27;s tax reductions compared to the simple write off. The caveat is that it must be completed prior to the date of final foreclosure and loss. The process is simple, but finding a charity to cooperate with is difficult since there will be no cash value as soon as the 1st mortgage forecloses.

====Problem loan====
Problem loans are loans that borrowers do not pay back because they are unable to or do not want to. These loans arise due to banks giving excess loans, loans with difficult repayment terms, and improper documentation.

<text>Voyage from Yesteryear is a 1982 science fiction novel by British writer James P. Hogan.

== Origins ==
According to Hogan, the idea for the book originated around 1976 when he was asked by a friend about whether there was a solution to &quot;the Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland. He said that there was no solution that he could see and that the only thing that might work was separating the children and the adults to prevent the prejudices from being taught at an early age. However, some years later he returned to the concept of a society free from conditioning, which formed part of the basis for &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story opens early in the 21st century, as an automated space probe is being prepared for a mission to explore habitable exoplanets in the Alpha Centauri system. However, Earth appears destined for a global war which the probe designers fear that humanity may not survive. It appears that the only chance for the human species is to reestablish itself far away from the conflict but there is no time left for a crewed expedition to escape Earth. The team, led by Henry B. Congreve, change their mission priority and quickly modify the design to carry several hundred sets of electronically coded human genetic data. Also included in this mission of embryo space colonization is a databank of human knowledge, robots to convert the data into genetic material and care for the children and construct habitats when the destination is reached, and a number of artificial wombs. The probe&#x27;s designers name it the &quot;Kuan-Yin&quot; after the bodhisattva of childbirth and compassion.

Shortly after the launch, global war indeed breaks out and several decades later, Earthbound humanity is united under an authoritarian government. It is this government that receives a radio message from the fledgling &quot;Chironian&quot; civilization revealing that the probe found a habitable planet (Chiron) and that the first generation of children have been raised successfully.

As the surviving power blocs of Earth before the conflict are still evident, North America, Europe and Asia each send a generation ship to Alpha Centauri to take control of the colony. By the time that the first generation ship (the American &quot;Mayflower II&quot;) arrives after 20 years, Chironian society is in its fifth generation.

The &quot;Mayflower II&quot; has brought with it thousands of settlers, all the trappings of the authoritarian regime along with bureaucracy, religion, fascism and a military presence to keep the population in line. However, the planners behind the generation ship did not anticipate the direction that Chironian society took: in the absence of conditioning and with limitless robotic labor and fusion power, Chiron has become a post-scarcity economy. Money and material possessions are meaningless to the Chironians and social standing is determined by individual talent, which has resulted in a wealth of art and technology without any hierarchies, central authority or armed conflict.

In an attempt to crush this anarchist adhocracy, the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; government employs every available method of control; however, in the absence of conditioning the Chironians are not even capable of comprehending the methods, let alone bowing to them. The Chironians simply use methods similar to Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;satyagraha&quot; and other forms of nonviolent resistance to win over most of the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; crew members, who had never previously experienced true freedom, and isolate the die-hard authoritarians.

Frustrated with their lack of success, the authoritarian faction stages a military coup on board the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; and launches the ship&#x27;s heavily armed &quot;battle module&quot;, threatening to attack unless they submit to a military dictatorship. Having isolated the authoritarians, the Chironians destroy the module with an antimatter particle beam weapon. The remainder of the crew dissolve their government and join Chironian society. The week after, the laser communications beam to the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; cuts off, having been destroyed in another global war that had taken place 4.5 years ago.

The epilogue is set five years after these events and shows that the Chironians also assimilated the crews of the Asian and European starships. Now united, the Chironians refit and recommission the &quot;Mayflower II&quot; with an advanced antimatter drive and rename it the &quot;Henry B. Congreve&quot;. The &quot;Henry B. Congreve&quot; is sent back to Earth to rebuild human civilization (with the new drive, this journey will only take eight years), fulfilling the &quot;Kuan-Yin&quot;&#x27;s mission of preserving humanity.

==Reception and influences==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #57, and stated that &quot;Solid and quite worthy stuff, but practically devoid of characterization.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Voyage from Yesteryear&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;The clash of worlds is a clash of world-views, the peaceful anarchy of Chiron against the new authoritarian regimes of Earth. It&#x27;s unfortunate Hogan couldn&#x27;t have made it just a &quot;little&quot; less obvious which side&#x27;s going to win.&quot;

Much of the reaction to the novel has been related to the creation of the Chironian society. Ken MacLeod praised the &quot;attractive and ... plausible depiction of a communist anarchy&quot; while John Clute compared it with the work of Eric Frank Russell. The strong libertarian themes in the novel led to it winning the Prometheus Award in 1983, the first of Hogan&#x27;s two wins.

Hogan&#x27;s essay &quot;What Really Brought Down Communism?&quot; explains the reception given to the book in the Soviet Union. In the mid-1980s, Hogan was informed that the novel had been serialized in a Polish science fiction magazine &quot;Fantastyka&quot;, and, in the absence of a functioning exchange mechanism, paid for it in Polish złotys credited to an account taken out in Hogan&#x27;s name. The story was republished in other Eastern European countries where its depiction of nonviolent resistance against authority proved popular. In 1989, Hogan attended a convention in Kraków before travelling to Warsaw to meet the publishers of the magazine serial and draw out the money he had been paid. However, inflation following the collapse of the communist regime had reduced the value of the money in the account to just $8.43. Hogan concluded: &quot;So after the U.S. had spent trillions on its B-52s, Trident submarines, NSA, CIA, and the rest, that was my tab for toppling the Soviet empire. There&#x27;s always an easy way if you just look.&quot;

<text>Simon Philip Bates (born 17 December 1946) is an English disc jockey and radio presenter. Between 1976 and 1993 he worked at BBC Radio 1, presenting the station&#x27;s weekday mid-morning show for most of this period. He later became a regular presenter on Classic FM. He hosted the breakfast show on Smooth Radio from January 2011 until March 2014, and took on the same role at BBC Radio Devon from January 2015 until January 2017.
He was the first presenter of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Food and Drink&quot; programme in 1982.

==Early life and career==
Bates was raised in Suffolk and Shropshire and educated at Adams&#x27; Grammar School before working for radio stations in New Zealand and Australia. Bates returned to the UK in 1971 to join the BBC, initially working for BBC Radio 4 as a continuity announcer and newsreader and then joining BBC Radio 2 in 1972 also reading the news and announcing as well as presenting a number of music programmes including &quot;Sounds Easy&quot;, &quot;Sweet &#x27;n&#x27; Swing&quot;, &quot;Night Ride&quot;, &quot;Late Night Extra&quot; and, from March 1974, &quot;The Early Show&quot;. Bates left BBC Radio 2 in January 1976 and joined BBC Radio 1 in May the same year standing in for Tom Browne to host the Sunday Top 20 show before beginning to present the Sunday morning show two months later.

==Broadcasting career==

===BBC Radio 1===

Initially a weekend presenter playing new pop records, Bates took over the weekday mid-morning programme in November 1977 and remained for 16 years, with up to 11 million listeners.

Two long-running features of his programme were &quot;The Golden Hour&quot; and &quot;Our Tune&quot;. Bates inherited &quot;The Golden Hour&quot; from Tony Blackburn. Listeners had to guess the year from records played and clues given by Bates.

&quot;Our Tune&quot; ran from 1980 at 11am. Over Nino Rota&#x27;s theme to Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s film &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), Bates read a sentimental story sent by a listener, ending with a record chosen by the correspondent. In &quot;The Birthday File&quot; Bates played music by stars celebrating a birthday.

Bates&#x27; programme featured Jonathan King to comment about music and interviewed stars at the BRIT Awards. In 1989 his summer series &quot;Round The World&quot; was broadcast from a different country each day. He went round the world in 67 days and raised £300,000 for Oxfam. Bates presented the Sunday afternoon Top 40 from 2 April 1978 to 26 August 1979 and from 8 January 1984 to 23 September 1984. He presented BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; regularly from 1980 to 1988. He presented the station&#x27;s roadshow before retiring from the duties after his round-the-world trip in 1989.

When Matthew Bannister arrived to modernise Radio 1, Bates was thought to be under threat. Bannister says in &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite&quot; that he feared Bates&#x27;s supposed subversive influence rather than his broadcasting style. Bates resigned in summer 1993 before the station could dismiss him, playing &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)&quot; by Reunion as his last record.

Bates has been on all five national BBC stations – apart from his stint at BBC Radio 1 and his broadcasts for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4, he also presented a Prom concert on BBC Radio 3 in 1987 and presented a digest of the daily papers on the original BBC Radio 5 (now BBC Radio Five Live) in 1990.

===After Radio 1===
After leaving Radio 1 he worked for Irish-based long wave station Atlantic 252, reviving &quot;Our Tune&quot; and then presented a TV version of the feature daily for BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; in 199495 and later for Sky One.

During these few years he also became the face of the VSC often seen before films that had come out on rental video, describing the classification of the film. This was lampooned by comedians such as Harry Enfield and Ben Elton. Bates appeared as himself in a parody of these announcements in adverts for the video game &quot;Primal Rage&quot;.

From September 1995 to April 1996, Bates broadcast for Talk Radio UK (now TalkSPORT) as the breakfast show presenter. He was then heard on London&#x27;s Liberty Radio as mid-morning presenter until 1997.

In 1997, Bates joined Classic FM, presenting the weekly Classic Romance programme. He was also heard on BBC Southern Counties Radio presenting a Sunday morning show until late 1998. In addition, between 1996 and 1998, Bates presented a show on the Classic Gold Network on weekday evenings. He then moved to London&#x27;s LBC as breakfast host from 1999 to 2002. He also did an earlier stint for LBC in the 10-till-1 morning slot.

===Classic FM===
Bates originally appeared on Classic FM in 1997, presenting the weekly &quot;Classic Romance&quot; show. In mid-2002 he was offered his first daily slot, presenting the drivetime show. From June 2003 he hosted the Classic FM weekday breakfast show and the one-hour &quot;Classic FM at the Movies&quot; programme, discussing films and film music on Sunday evening. In September 2006, his programme&#x27;s hours changed from 711am to 8amnoon. In 2010 Bates was moved to mid morning (9am to 1pm) and shortly afterwards it was announced he left the station in January 2011 to present a show on Smooth Radio.

===Gold===
As well as his daily show for Classic FM, Bates could also be heard on the Gold Radio Network every Sunday morning from 8am to noon.

===Smooth Radio===

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that from January 2011 Simon Bates would take over as host of the Breakfast Show on Smooth Radio, leaving Classic FM after 13 years of broadcasting. Bates&#x27; show replaced local programming on a number of regional radio stations and began on 4 January 2011, except for Scottish stations which continued with locally produced shows. He brought back both &quot;The Golden Hour&quot; and &quot;Our Tune&quot; to the show. &quot;The Golden Hour&quot; aired every day from 9am to 10am as it did originally, while Our Tune aired each morning at 8:40am. Other features in the show included the Thousand Pound Minute, where listeners needed to answer ten questions correctly within 60 seconds to win £1,000.

In September 2012 the radio industry news website &quot;Radio Today&quot; reported that Bates had started to present a separate breakfast show for Smooth Radio&#x27;s sister station, Smooth 70s. Smooth Radio did not publicise the show, but confirmed Bates was providing &quot;a little content&quot; when asked about the programme. The content was &quot;voice tracked&quot; from the main breakfast show.

Bates left Smooth Radio on 21 March 2014.

===BBC Radio Devon===
Bates, who lived on a farm in mid-Devon, started hosting the BBC Radio Devon breakfast show from 6:30am to 10am on weekdays from 12 January 2015. He also featured the Golden Hour from 9am to 10am; the years ranged from 1956 to 2004.

===2017===
Bates left BBC Radio Devon on 8 January 2017 to &quot;move on to other things.&quot; Gordon Sparks took over the breakfast show.

On 2 October 2017, Bates participated in Radio 1 Vintage, doing an interview about his time on BBC Radio 1.

===2020===

In 2020, Bates was hired to do the voice over for Channel 5&#x27;s weekly countdown of the 30 biggest selling singles of one year in the UK (known under a number of titles such as &quot;Britains Favourite 80s Songs&quot;, &quot;The 90s Greatest Hits 1990 -1999&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Biggest 90s Hits&quot; and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite 90s Songs&quot;).

===2023===

Boom Radio announced that in August, Simon Bates will be joining and presenting a regular Sunday show, which will air on Sunday afternoons between 2pm-4pm. And in October 2023, he began presenting hits from the 1970s on Boom Radio - Saturdays - 12pm-2pm.

<doc id="1126444" wikidata="Q3487115" url="?curid=1126444" title="By Any Other Name">
<text>&quot;By Any Other Name&quot; is the 22nd episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by D.C. Fontana and Jerome Bixby (based on Bixby&#x27;s story) and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast February 23, 1968.

In the episode, beings from another galaxy commandeer the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in an attempt to return home.

The title is taken from a line spoken by Juliet in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;: &quot;that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet&quot;, a line quoted by Captain Kirk during the episode.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; responds to a distress call from an uncharted planet. A landing party beams down to locate the source, and promptly finds a humanoid male and female, Rojan and Kelinda of the Kelvan Empire, who immediately paralyze Kirk and the landing party and order Kirk to surrender the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Rojan tells Kirk that the Kelvans originate from the Andromeda Galaxy, and have come to find planets suitable for conquest in the Milky Way galaxy. As their own ship had been destroyed by the negative-energy barrier at the galactic rim, they need the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to make the 300-year return journey. Three other Kelvans transport aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and quickly gain control of the ship.

Rojan orders the landing party to a cave guarded by Kelinda. Mr. Spock uses his Vulcan telepathic ability to lure her into the cave, where Kirk knocks her unconscious and seizes her control belt. Spock is thrown back out of the mind meld by the Kelvans&#x27; alienness. Their freedom is short-lived, however, and as punishment Rojan orders the Kelvan Hanar to activate his belt, transforming two of the landing team members to small spongy cuboctahedral blocks of a chalk-like substance. Rojan picks up the blocks and crushes one to dust, killing Yeoman Thompson. He then transforms the other block (Lt. Shea) back into human form.

Back in their cell, Spock relates the experience of his mental contact with Kelinda. The Kelvans, it seems, are not humanoid after all, but have taken human form for convenience; they are actually huge creatures with hundreds of tentacles.

Kirk and Spock decide to try to adapt McCoy&#x27;s neural scanning equipment into a countermeasure to the Kelvans&#x27; paralysis field. As a pretext for beaming back to the ship, Spock feigns illness by placing himself into a deep trance. The Kelvans transport the rest of the landing party and themselves to the ship shortly afterwards.

Spock determines that there is no hope of penetrating the paralysis field projector&#x27;s casing. Instead, he has Scott rig the matter/antimatter system to explode on contact with the galactic barrier if Kirk so orders, but which Kirk opts not to activate.

Once the ship has crossed the galactic barrier, the Kelvans reduce (&quot;neutralize&quot;) all personnel except Kirk, Scott, Spock, and McCoy into cuboctahedral spongy blocks of a chalk-like substance. Spock remembers more from his mental contact with Kelinda and reveals that the Kelvans in their natural form have very weak senses and emotions, but in their present form they are having human reactions. Kirk decides to use their inexperience with physical and emotional stimuli against them.

Scott introduces the Kelvan engineer Tomar to the alcoholic beverages such as Saurian Brandy, something &quot;green&quot; from Ganymede and finally &quot;very very very old scotch&quot;, McCoy injects Hanar with a &quot;supplement&quot; for Anemia that is actually a stimulant, and Kirk begins a flirtation with Kelinda, provoking feelings of jealousy in Rojan. Kirk is eventually able to goad Rojan after &quot;apologizing&quot; to Kelinda again into attacking him, and, in the course of the fight, points out that Rojan is behaving like a human and that his descendants who reach the Andromeda Galaxy will be alien inferiors in the eyes of the Kelvans. Realizing Kirk is correct, Rojan relinquishes control of the ship to Kirk, who then gives the order to return &quot;home&quot; to our galaxy while sending a &quot;robot ship&quot; to Kelva with a Federation proposal. The world on which Rojan and his people were marooned is suggested as their new home.

<text>Kahurangi Point is a headland on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, overlooking the Tasman Sea. It is located in Kahurangi National Park between Karamea and Farewell Spit.

Kahurangi Point is traditionally regarded as the northernmost point of the West Coast region, although for most purposes it is considered part of the Tasman District region.

A lighthouse was built in 1903, automated in 1926, staff removed in 1960 and replaced with an LED beacon in 2007. The materials for the building were shipped to Big River about to the north, then carted along the beach and hauled up a light tramway. The keeper&#x27;s house is now a Department of Conservation hut.

The Kahurangi upwelling system makes the area rich in oceanic biodiversity and the waters off Kahurangi Point is one of areas being frequented by pygmy blue whales along with off South Taranaki Bight which was discovered in 2007 and was confirmed in 2014.

<doc id="1126453" wikidata="Q608243" url="?curid=1126453" title="Drug Policy Alliance">
<text>The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) is a New York City–based nonprofit organization that seeks to advance policies that &quot;reduce the harms of both drug use and drug prohibition, and to promote the sovereignty of individuals over their minds and bodies&quot;. The organization prioritizes reducing the role of criminalization in drug policy, advocating for the legal regulation of marijuana, and promoting health-centered drug policies.

==History==
The Drug Policy Alliance was formed when the Drug Policy Foundation and the Lindesmith Center merged in July 2000. Lindesmith Center founder. Ethan Nadelmann served as its first Executive Director. From October 2017, it was led by Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno. Since September 2020, it has been led by executive director Kassandra Frederique.
==Main issues==
===Drug war===
DPA believes that the War on drugs in America has failed. They present the argument that the United States has spent billions of dollars on making the country drug-free, but many illicit drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and many others, are more potent and prevalent than ever before.

===Communities affected===
DPA believes that the war on drugs does not affect all of the American population the same way, and that some communities are disproportionately affected.

== Results ==
In 2020, DPA&#x27;s advocacy and political arm, Drug Policy Action, spearheaded the passage of the Oregon Ballot Measure 110, which made Oregon the first state in the nation to decriminalize drug possession while significantly expanding access to evidence-informed, culturally responsive treatment, harm reduction and other health services.

<doc id="1126465" wikidata="Q15500028" url="?curid=1126465" title="The Children of Sanchez (book)">
<text>The Children of Sanchez is a 1961 book by American anthropologist Oscar Lewis about a Mexican family living in the Mexico City slum of Tepito, which he studied as part of his program to develop his concept of culture of poverty. The book is subtitled &quot;Autobiography of a Mexican family&quot;. According to the dedication by the author in the opening pages of the book, the actual last name of the family is not &quot;Sanchez&quot;, in order to maintain the privacy of the family members. 

Due to criticisms expressed by members of the family regarding the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government and Mexican presidents such as Adolfo Ruiz Cortines and Adolfo López Mateos, and its being written by a foreigner, the book was banned in Mexico for a few years before pressure from literary figures resulted in its publication.

The particular ethnographic reality that Lewis is focussing on in his book was the plight of the urban poor in a developing country. The political implications of this approach caused some concern when The
Children of Sánchez was published in Mexico in Spanish in 1964. Formal charges were made against Lewis and the publisher by the Mexican Geographical and Statistical Society, accusing them of writing and publishing an obscene and denigrating book. The hearing of the case, the text of which was appended to the second Mexican edition by Joaquin Mortiz, resulted in the dismissal of the charges against Lewis and the publisher as unfounded.

Jesús Sánchez, age fifty, is the father, and his four children are Manuel, age thirty-two; Roberto, twenty-nine; Consuelo, twenty-seven; and Marta, twenty-five. The content of the book itself consists of the life stories and accounts of these five people, as recorded in their own words by the author. Most of the interviews and the recorded events center around the Casa Grande Vecindad, a large one-story slum settlement, in the center of Mexico City. Elizabeth Hardwick described the result as &quot;a moving, strange tragedy, not an interview, a questionnaire or a sociological study.&quot; 

==Film==
A film based on the book and with the same title was directed by Hall Bartlett and was released in 1979. It stars Anthony Quinn as Jesús Sánchez.

<doc id="1126467" wikidata="Q1921408" url="?curid=1126467" title="Mercenary (video game)">
<text>Mercenary is a 3D action-adventure game written for the Atari 8-bit computers and published by Novagen Software in 1985. It was converted to the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, and Commodore 16/116/Plus/4. The game uses vector graphics renderings of vast, sparse environments and has various methods of completing the game. It was also released as Mercenary: Escape from Targ and Mercenary: A Flight Simulator Adventure. 

&quot;Mercenary&quot; was favourably reviewed and followed by two sequels: &quot;Damocles&quot; and &quot;Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis&quot;.

==Plot==
Having crash-landed on the planet Targ (&quot;en route&quot; to the Gamma System of &quot;Damocles&quot;), the player&#x27;s main objective is to find a means of escape. There are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous &quot;good guys&quot;) and the Mechanoids (invading &quot;bad guys&quot;), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ.

The player is accompanied and advised by Benson, a &quot;9th generation PC&quot;. This interaction is handled via a scrolling news ticker at the bottom of the display. As well as providing assistance to the player, much of the humour within the games comes from the occasional sarcastic remarks made by Benson.

==Gameplay==

The player explores a world rendered in realtime 3D graphics, completing a number of non-linear tasks in order to achieve a single main objective. The title of the series derives from the player&#x27;s role in carrying out tasks as a &quot;hired gun&quot;. The player is able to play the warring factions off against one another to their own advantage. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there.

==&quot;Mercenary: The Second City&quot;==

&quot;Mercenary: The Second City&quot;, released in 1986, is an expansion pack. Initially its major distinction is the new colour scheme, representing the other side of the planet. The ground is now red rather than the original green, and the sky is no longer blue. Instead, it is pink in the Amiga and Atari (8-bit and ST) versions, dark blue on the Commodore 8-bit platforms (C64 and Plus/4) and yellow on the ZX Spectrum.

However, after a similar objective, the substantive differences reveal themselves subtly: there is a different city layout, a more intricate underground complex, a new set of puzzles to overcome and several significant changes with game objects.

==Reception==
&quot;Mercenary&quot; received strong positive reviews from gaming magazines across all platforms, with the original &quot;Mercenary&quot; receiving a Gold Medal from &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine. &quot;RUN&quot; reviewer Bob Sodaro noted the replay value of &quot;Mercenary&quot; for the Commodore 64, writing: &quot;Prior to marking up the maps [included with the game], you should make a number of photocopies so you&#x27;ll have clean copies when playing subsequent adventures&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; also advised making copies of the map and taking notes. It described the game&#x27;s size and Atari 8-bit version&#x27;s graphics as &quot;awesome&quot;, but warned that a colour display was required. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Mercenary&quot;″s video effects make it a good game overall. But if you aren&#x27;t in the right place to pick up the clues, you&#x27;ll get nowhere&quot;.

The ZX Spectrum version of &quot;Mercenary&quot; was voted number 15 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number six on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the Commodore 64 version 33rd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

Steve Jarratt, editor of &quot;Edge&quot;, listed &quot;Mercenary&quot; as one of his favorite games of all time and the game was ranked 67th in the magazine&#x27;s list of top 100 games in 2000.

==Legacy==
===&quot;Damocles&quot;===

&quot;Damocles&quot; (also advertised as &quot;Mercenary II&quot;) is the second game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga platforms in 1990. Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were in development but cancelled. &quot;Damocles&quot; represents the game environment using filled polygon graphics. Two mission disks were released.

===&quot;Mercenary III&quot;===

&quot;Mercenary III&quot; (also known as &quot;Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis&quot; or &quot;Damocles II&quot;) is the third game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga in 1992. This time the roads of the various cities are populated by vehicles such as taxis and buses. Observation and attack spacecraft are present in the skies. Interaction with other characters is possible to a limited degree.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Mercenary&quot; and &quot;The Second City&quot; were later combined into the &quot;Mercenary Compendium&quot;.

In the 2000s, the three games were ported to Microsoft Windows. It was distributed with the agreement of the former Novagen team. The program, called &quot;MDDClone&quot; (Mercenary, Damocles, Dion crisis Clone) is freeware, includes all three games, selectable through a drop-down list. The graphics and gameplay are identical to the Atari ST version, with the additional option to fix some bugs that were originally present.

Another port, focusing on the first game, was released in 2010. Called &quot;MDDClone-SDL&quot;, this offers support for higher resolutions and texture mapping. Versions for Windows, OSX, Linux and FreeBSD are available.

In 2018, an open source port of &quot;Damocles&quot; and &quot;Mercenary III&quot; was released. Called &quot;Mercenary Reloaded&quot;, this port offers support for higher resolutions, a higher frame rate with smoother movements, virtual reality as per the specifications of the Oculus Rift head-mounted display, and a separate side-by-side stereoscopic mode.

<text>Princetta Kay Adams (born April 9, 1941) is an American country music singer.

== Biography ==
Kay Adams was born Princetta Kay Adams in Knox City, Texas, the fourth of five children to Charley Alva Adams (1908–1969) and Ola May Henson (1914–1993). Her father was a talented fiddle player. She moved at the age of 10, along with her family, to Vernon, Texas.

In the 1960s, Adams arrived on the country scene with the songs &quot;Six Days a Waiting,&quot; &quot;Old Heart Get Ready,&quot; &quot;Anymore,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk Trouble To Me,&quot; &quot;Trapped,&quot; &quot;Roll Out The Red Carpet,&quot; &quot;I Cried At Your Wedding,&quot; &quot;Honky Tonk Heartache&quot; and &quot;She Didn&#x27;t Color Daddy.&quot; She appeared as a regular on such Bakersfield based country music TV programs as &quot;Buck Owens&#x27; Ranch&quot; and the &quot;Dave Stogner Show&quot;.

At the inaugural Academy of Country Music Awards, in 1965, Adams was named Top New Female Vocalist. Merle Haggard was named Top New Male Vocalist, while Top Male Vocalist and Top Female Vocalist went to Buck Owens and Bonnie Owens. The following year, Adams was nominated for Top Female Vocalist.

Before 1966, women never recorded songs about truck driving. Adams, however, had a hit that year with &quot;Little Pink Mack,&quot; a song giving the point of view of a woman driver, which is the only song on the album by a woman. In the song her truck has chrome and it &quot;has polka-dot curtains hangin&#x27; in the sleeper,&quot; but is the fastest big-wheeler on the road. In her &quot;truck drivin&#x27; boots&quot; she stands about five-foot three, but she can take care of herself. With a full-force Bakersfield sound twangy Telecaster and some fuzz-tone steel guitar backing, she delivers the story of a truck driving woman who makes it clear she &quot;cut my baby teeth on a set of Spicer gears. I’m a gear-swappin’ mama, and I don’t know the meaning of fear.&quot; All the truckers are asked, &quot;Who&#x27;s the gal in the little pink Mack?&quot;

It was just a couple years before Tammy Wynette sang the praises of standing by one’s man, and a decade before Loretta Lynn celebrated reproductive freedom in her controversial hit, &quot;The Pill,&quot; but country singer Kay Adams demolished at least one gender stereotype in 1966 with her hit single &quot;Little Pink Mack.&quot;

Adams&#x27;s vocal style carried a lot of Wanda Jackson’s sassy, husky-throated rockabilly abandon, a hint of Wynette’s lovelorn sob and a sense of Connie Smith’s emotional openness. More than just a novelty tune, &quot;Little Pink Mack&quot; was a friendly-but-firm challenge to the testosterone and diesel-fueled world of the &quot;knights of the highway,&quot; long distance truckers.

Adams was married first to Robert W. Willard, in 1958. They were divorced in 1967 at Bakersfield. She and her second husband also divorced. She married for a third time, to songwriter Buck Moore. She and Willard had two sons, Daniel Ray Willard (born December 19, 1959) and Stewart Wayne Willard (born December 16, 1961).

Her 1966 album &quot;A Devil Like Me Needs An Angel Like You&quot;, was a duo with singer Dick Curless. She also sang on the soundtrack-album of the western movie &quot;Killers Three&quot; (|1968), which also featured Merle Haggard and Bonnie Owens. In the 1970s, she recorded &quot;I Never Got to Nashville&quot; for Cliffie Stone&#x27;s Granite Records. Most recently she recorded &quot;Mama Was A Rock (Daddy Was A Rolling Stone)&quot; in 1996 with BR5-49 for the compilation CD &quot;Rig Rock Deluxe: A Musical Salute To The American Truck Driver&quot;, and &quot;Trixie&#x27;s Diesel-Stop Cafe&quot; with The Dixie Bee-Liners on their 2009 bluegrass concept album &quot;Susanville&quot;.

Kay Adams&#x27;s albums include &quot;A Devil Like Me Needs An Angel Like You,&quot; &quot;Wheels And Tears,&quot; &quot;Make Mine Country,&quot; and &quot;Alcohol And Tears.&quot;

<text>The Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe, commonly known as the Bishop in Europe, is the ordinary of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese in Europe in the Province of Canterbury.

==Overview==
The diocese provides the ministry of Anglican chaplains, not only in the area of Gibraltar in British jurisdiction but also in all of mainland Europe, Morocco and the territory of the former Soviet Union. The see is based in the City of Gibraltar where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located at the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity. 

Bishops in Europe John Hind (1993–2001) and Geoffrey Rowell (2001–2013) resided in England at Bishop&#x27;s Lodge in Worth, Crawley, West Sussex (close to Gatwick Airport, to facilitate ease of travel). Incumbent Robert Innes (2014–present) is based in Waterloo, Belgium. The diocesan office and administrative team, with the office of the suffragan bishop, is in Tufton Street, London, part of the Church House complex.

The bishopric has existed since the union in 1980 of the see of Gibraltar (founded 1842) with the Jurisdiction of North and Central Europe of the see of London (headed by the suffragan Bishop of Fulham). 

== List of Anglican Bishops of Europe ==

(Any dates appearing in italics indicate &quot;de facto &quot; continuation of office. The start date of tenure below is the date of appointment or succession. Where known, the date of installation and ordination as bishop are listed in the notes together with the post held prior to appointment.)
== Suffragan and assistant bishops ==
The bishop also has one suffragan bishop, known as the Suffragan Bishop in Europe (currently vacant; the most recent incumbent was David Hamid) and various honorary assistant bishops from the Church of England and other churches in communion with the Church of England. Immediately prior to the 1980 (re)erection of the diocese and the creation of the post of Suffragan Bishop, the Diocese of Gibraltar and the jurisdiction of Fulham shared a full-time assistant bishop in a similar post – at least Harold Isherwood and Ambrose Weekes served in that role; indeed Weekes became the first Suffragan Bishop in 1980. &quot;(See Suffragan Bishop in Europe.)&quot;

Edmund Capper and Ambrose Weekes were assistant (auxiliary) bishops of the diocese in 1988; Weekes was still one in 2004. Ken Giggall, former Bishop of St Helena, Chaplain of Sanremo with Bordighera was also an auxiliary bishop (1979–1981). Frank Sargeant, retired Bishop at Lambeth, was an assistant bishop of the diocese, 1999–2008.

Nicholas Reade, retired bishop of Blackburn, was licensed an honorary assistant bishop in 2013.

<doc id="1126473" wikidata="Q1969256" url="?curid=1126473" title="Alianza F.C. (El Salvador)">
<text>Alianza Fútbol Club, also known simply as Alianza, is a professional football club based in San Salvador, El Salvador. Founded in 1958, Alianza was almost immediately successful, winning its first championships in the 1966 and 1967 Salvadoran seasons. Even more significantly, Alianza was the first Central American and Salvadoran club to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1967, and is currently one of only three Salvadoran teams to have done so.

==History==

===The beginning===
&quot;Atlético La Constancia&quot; was formed in 1958 by a group of workers in San Salvador. Although small in terms of financial status, they were able to reach the Liga de Ascenso (second division) final in 1958. They lost 2–0 in a two legged series against Águila. The club, however, purchased a spot in the first division at the expense of Once Municipal. This enabled them to gain the sponsorship of the Intercontinental Hotel and its president, Peruvian Axel Hochkoeppler.

Because of Hochkoeppler&#x27;s support, Alianza FC president Enrique Sol Meza decided to name the club Alianza FC in honor of Alianza Lima. Hernán Vivanco joined the club as the coach and began getting the players to play an exciting style of football. That style and a strong advertising campaign quickly won over the support of the population of San Salvador. Before long, Alianza was surpassing Juventud Olímpica as the nation&#x27;s most popular club.

One of Alianza&#x27;s greatest triumphs happened in 1966, when they defeated a Santos side that included the great Pelé. The win took place at the Estadio Nacional Flor Blanc, and featured the efforts of loaned Argentines Dante Juárez, Juan Verón and Santiago, all on loan at the time.

===Orquesta Blanca===
1966 was also the year that Alianza won its first tile. Due to the cohesion and speed with which Hernán Carrasco had the team playing, Alianza became known as &quot;La Orquesta Alba&quot; (the Dawn Orchestra). The team was made up of many great players, including Edgar &quot;Pata Gorda&quot; Morales, Roberto &quot;La Burra&quot; Rivas, Alberto &quot;Pechuga&quot; Villalta, Raúl &quot;Araña&quot; Magaña, Guido Alvarado, Salvador Mariona, Mario Monge, Luis &quot;Cascarita&quot; Tapia, Miguel &quot;El Chueco&quot; Hermosilla, Ricardo Sepúlveda and Jorge &quot;El Conejo&quot; Liévano.

The team won fifteen straight matches on their way to the league championship, where they defeated Águila 2–1. Goals were scored by Hermosilla and Mario Monge. In all, &quot;La Orquesta Alba&quot; outscored their opponents eighty-three to thirty-nine and won twenty of their thirty-six matches.

The club repeated as champions in 1967, defeating Sonsonate FC 5–1 in the finals. They then went on to become the first El Salvadoran club to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, defeating Jong Colombia over a three-leg series. Alianza lost the first leg, but won the second to force a replay. They prevailed 5–3, with Tapia and Flores scoring twice each.

===Decline and title drought===
After the 1967 title, members of the Orquestra began retiring. Players like Brazilian internationals Camargo, Taneses and Nilton Rodarte, Peruvian international Fernando Alva, Uruguayan international Julio César &quot;El Pocho&quot; Cortés, Chilean international Hugo Ottensen came through the ranks. So too did domestic players including Miguel &quot;La Mica&quot; González, Herbert Machón, &quot;Míchel&quot; Cornejo, Armando Cortez Sandoval, Jaime &quot;Samba&quot; Saravia, Roberto &quot;El Cuchillo&quot; Guerra, Jaime &quot;La Chelona&quot; Rodríguez and Carlos &quot;El Cacho&quot; Meléndez. However, the 1970s were less successful than the 1960s.

They reached the playoff finals four times (1971, 1973, 1975–76, and 1978–79) but finished runner-up each time. Then, after a string of disappointing seasons, the club came out of the wilderness to challenge for the title in 1985. However, they would be runners-up again, losing 5–2 to city rivals Atlético Marte.
===Title success===
In 1986, the title drought finally ended. Ricardo Sepúlveda, a member of &quot;The Orquesta Alba&quot;, returned to the club as a manager and led them to their third championship and first in twenty years. The championship match pitted Alianza against Águila, and it ended 0–0 after extra time. The game went to penalties, and Alianza won 3–1, with Carlos Reyes scoring the decisive goal. A corner had been turned.

The brilliance of Chilean Raúl Toro powered Alianza to a fourth title in 1989; he scored the winning goal in the final against Luis Ángel Firpo. 1993–94 saw a fifth crown, as the Uruguayan Gustavo Faral managed the club to a 2–1 championship win over FAS.

1997 saw Alianza win its second international championship, when they defeated Deportivo Saprissa from Costa Rica to win the UNCAF Club Championship. The management of technician Juan Carlos Masnik and the heroic efforts of players such as Horacio Lugo, Marcelo Bauza, Uruguayan Alejandro Curbelo and Adrián de la Cruz powered the team to two more titles soon after.

===The Invincibles===
Alianza went through the Apertura 2017 season undefeated, becoming the first Salvadoran side to achieve such a feat. Their 4–1 win over Santa Tecla in the final was the icing on the cake, and saw a double from Rodolfo Zelaya, plus strikes from league leading goalscorer Gustavo Guerreño, and midfielder Marvin Monterrosa.

<text>Charles Pye (chr: 24 September 1820 – 12 July 1876) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Pye was approximately 37 years old, and a sergeant-major in the 53rd Regiment of Foot (later The King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 17 November 1857 at Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the VC:
Charles Pye is not to be confused with Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Colquhoun Pye (11 Nov 1834 – 17 Feb 1872), son of Henry John Pye and Mary Anne Walker of Clifton Campville, Staffordshire. Charles Colquhoun Pye was not the recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Charles Pye was the eldest child of Thomas Pye and Alice Hall. Born in 1820 his birth date is unknown. His baptism occurred on 24 September 1820 at St Mary&#x27;s church, Castle Church, Staffordshire. Charles was probably a few months old when he was baptised. His death certificate and obituary state he was 56 years old when he died, which suggests he was born prior to July 1820.

Charles&#x27;s brothers, Timothy (b 1822) and Philip (b 1824), were born at Rickerscote where their father, Thomas Pye, was a labourer. His sister Harriet (b 1826) and brother Peter (b 1830) were born in Birmingham, where Thomas was a brickmaker.

Following the death of their mother, Thomas took his children back to the family home at Rickerscote to be raised by his brother, George Pye and sister Mary Pye. George Pye was later quoted in a newspaper saying that Charles was &quot;educated at Stafford&quot; and indeed his later correspondence was well written.

With the conviction and transportation of their father in 1836 the children were virtually orphaned. Where Charles worked after the completion of his schooling is unknown, however, by 1840 he enlisted at Coventry, Warwickshire, from there being sent for service to India with the 40th Regiment.
Pye was promoted to Corporal and transferred into the 53rd Foot in 1858. He became adjutant in 1859 and was promoted without purchase to lieutenant on 9 April 1860.

On 14 April 1860 the 53rd Regiment, including Charles&#x27;s wife, Mary Ann and her children, Catherine and Matthew Farrell, returned to England on the &quot;Lady Clarendon&quot;.

In 1862 Charles Pye took his discharge and emigrated to New Zealand with his wife and stepdaughter. Here he was appointed Captain of the Auckland Militia in July 1863, and the following year as Captain of the Colonial Defence Force. He served at Hairini and Te Ranga in the Bay of Plenty and a redoubt near Tauranga, Pye&#x27;s Pa was named in his honour.

Following his discharge Charles Pye lived at Papakura then for a short time at Shortland (Thames) where he owned the Duke of Edinburgh goldmine. In 1875 he sailed to Australia, travelling to Kirkstall, Victoria, Australia where he purchased his father&#x27;s farm (his father having married again, had a second family in the district) in 1876 a month before he died on 12 July 1876. He is buried in the same cemetery as his three half brothers.

His medals were donated to the Auckland War Memorial Museum.

==Later life==
At the end of the Maori wars the Colonial Defence Force was stationed at Papakura where Charles was involved in the local community. He had been a far better soldier than a businessman as his bankruptcy attested. 
Following the disbanding of the Defence Force in 1866 and the opening up of the goldfields at Thames, Charles and his wife, Mary Ann moved to Karaka Hill, Shortland, Thames. He purchased the Duke of Edinburgh goldmine but was later led into speculating and lost heavily. By 1875, having discovered his father&#x27;s address he sailed to Australia where they reunited after an absence of forty years. He was taken ill with bronchitis which proved fatal and was buried in the Tower Hill cemetery at Koroit near Warrnambool. Mary Ann Pye died at her son-in-law&#x27;s home at Mangere on 31 December 1900 and is buried at the Mangere cemetery with her daughter and grandchildren. The farming locality of Pyes Pa, south of Tauranga, is named after him.
Memorials honouring Captain Pye can be found at Stafford, UK (his birthplace) and Kirkstall near Koroit, Victoria (his death place).

<text>Ross is a small town located in the Westland District on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, south-west of Hokitika and north-east of Hari Hari by road.

==History==
Ross was established in the 1860s, during the West Coast gold rush, and became an important centre for miners. At its largest, the town had around 2,500 inhabitants, but the population declined after local goldfields were depleted in the early 1870s. Quartz was occasionally mined on Mount Greenland, a nearby ridge, but little more gold was found until two miners discovered a large 3.1-kilogram nugget in 1909, which was later named the &quot;Honourable Roddy Nugget&quot;, after Roderick McKenzie, the Minister for Mines at the time.

From 1872 to the early 1900s a number of Chinese lived and worked in Ross, and a Chinese Miners&#x27; Memorial Garden on the shore of Ross Lake commemorates them.

The settlement was originally called Jones Flat, but was also sometimes known as Georgetown and Totara. It was given the name Rosstown, which was shortened to Ross in about 1866, after George Ross, who was the Canterbury Provincial Council&#x27;s treasurer at the time of the naming.

==Local government==
Following the abolition of Westland Province in 1876, Ross became part of Westland County. In 1878, Ross Borough was formed, with its own borough council and mayor, and remained in existence until 1972, when it merged back into Westland County. Since the local government reforms of 1989, Ross has been part of Westland District.

==Economy==

The town&#x27;s economy is based around farming and forestry; a large open-cut mine operated directly adjacent to the town since 1988, and the large pit it created was filled with water in the 2000s to create Ross Lake.

== Amenities and attractions ==
Amenities in Ross include a dairy/convenience store with a New Zealand Post agency and a small self-service petrol station, a volunteer fire brigade and a police station.

Beside Ross Lake is the Chinese Miners&#x27; Memorial Garden, created over a two-year period by the Ross volunteer group Westland Regional Environment Incorporated Society (WRENIS) led by Biddy Manera, at a cost of $180,000. It includes a Chinese pavilion (liang ting) and ornamental tree planting. In winter 2020 a slip in Jones Creek blocked the outlet of the lake, and the pavilion was flooded and thousands of dollars worth of trees and shrubs were killed. Fully repairing the lake outlet would require a resource consent, so in the meantime WRENIS volunteers dug a small channel by hand to divert some of the flow of Jones Creek to a culvert, allowing lake levels to stabilise; work done by hand did not require a consent. Their work was repeatedly vandalised, however, for months and on an almost daily basis, causing the lake to rise and drown the gardens again. The Westland Regional Council, which manages waterways, was called in to support WRENIS&#x27;s efforts. After two rounds of public consultation involving the Department of Conservation, the Westland District Council, and the Ross Community society, all parties agreed in March 2021 to lower the lake levels and prevent future flooding, with the District Council covering the cost of the resource consent.

==Education==

Ross School is the sole school in the town. It is a coeducational contributing (year 1–6) primary school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1875 and celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2000.

The nearest intermediate and secondary school (year 7–13) is Westland High School in Hokitika.

== Transport and infrastructure ==
State Highway 6 passes through the town, connecting it in the north to Hokitika and south to Hari Hari and Franz Josef.

Intercity Coaches provides a bus service tor Ross with daily services to both Fox Glacier and Greymouth.

Ross is at the southern end of the West Coast Wilderness Trail, a cycle route with its northern end at Greymouth.

A branch line railway known as the Ross Branch was extended from Ruatapu to Ross on 1 April 1909, serving as the southern terminus of the line owned by the New Zealand Railways Department. However, a lengthy privately owned bush tramway ran south from the railway station to serve logging interests near Lake Ianthe and a railway extension from Ross through the Haast Pass to connect with the Otago Central Railway was proposed in the early 20th century, but did not eventuate. From the 1940s until 9 October 1962, a Vulcan railcar service operated directly from Christchurch to Ross twice a day. A lack of traffic and expensive maintenance costs meant the line was closed beyond Hokitika on 24 November 1980. Much of the old track bed between Ruatapu and Hokitika can be driven as it serves as an access road for local farmers, and a disused truss bridge still stands north of Ross.

<doc id="1126486" wikidata="Q932563" url="?curid=1126486" title="C.D. Águila">
<text>Club Deportivo Águila, commonly known as Águila, is a Salvadoran professional football club based in San Miguel. The club currently competes in Primera División, the top tier of El Salvador football league system.

Águila is one of the most successful clubs in El Salvador football history.
C.D. Águila have won seventeen Primera División championships, one Copa Presidente, and one CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup 1976. Their CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup 1976 win made them the second Salvadoran team to win a CONCACAF title.

Since 1956, Águila have played their home games at Estadio Juan Francisco Barraza. The stadium is one of the biggest stadiums in El Salvador.

Aguila is one of the most widely supported football clubs in El Salvador, and has long standing rivalry with neighbours Dragón, known as the San Miguel derby, and also competes with power club FAS, known as El Clásico (English: The Classic).

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Club Deportivo Águila was founded on 15 February 1926, in the City of San Miguel, by a group of young people. The first club President was Victor Vanegas.
The major goal of the club was first to establish a baseball team, and later develop football and basketball teams. At the beginning, baseball and football were not as successful as basketball with the team dominating in both El Salvador as in neighbouring countries.

In 1956, a group met in San Miguel and decided to form a football team named Club Deportivo Águila. Their first act was to meet with the president of Alacranes, Miguel Sagastizado, after sometime negotiating, they purchased their spot in Liga B and this was ratified by FESFUT on 21 August 1956. In the first season the club played under the name of CD A, this was due to another club in the division Águilas FC from Santa Tecla having a similar name.
To attract big names players the clubs paid a minimum of 75 colones per month (US$8), which was above the average of their three biggest rivals (Dragon Rácing and Corona) paid their players per month, which was around 30 to 50 colones (US$3.40 – 5.70). This allowed them to signed players such as Juan Francisco Barraza, Esteban Blanco, Salvador Hernández, Fito Fuentes, Juan Merthem, Atilio Pineda, Honduran Manuel Larios, Saul Molina and Rodolfo Fuentes. This came at great cost professionally as FESFUT barred the players to play for the national team as no second division players were allowed to represent the national team.
They hired Argentinian Agustin Noriega who previously coached Guatemalan club like Guatemala Deportiva.
CD A first game was a 2–2 all draw with Titan, with Juan Antonio &quot;Maquinita&quot; Merlos scoring both goals, by the end of the season Juan Merlos was the team leading scorer with 16 goals.

During its time in the lower leagues, it fought for the affections of the San Miguel people alongside rival Dragón, but when they were promoted to the Liga, it attracted a following not only from San Miguel but also from the entire country. Proof of this was demonstrated by the fact that the teams sold more tickets when the local club played against Águila.

===First titles===
After two years in the Liga B (Segunda Division), Aguila qualified to Championship/Promotional series against Atlético Constancia (Currently known as Alianza F.C. Aguila won the first game 2–0, thanks to a double from Juan Antonio Merlos, and after 0–0 draw in the second leg. Aguila were promoted to the first division for the first time in the club history.
In their very first campaign, Under the tutelage of Conrado Miranda, Aguila won their first titles thank to combination of based players Juan Francisco Barraza, Juan Antonio Merlos and Saul Molina, and the incorporation of Costa Rican Fernando Jiménez. They became the first club to win a title after gaining promotion, only two other clubs have done that in the history of Primera Division (C.D. Platense Municipal Zacatecoluca and C.D. Vista Hermosa).

===Titles===
C.D. Águila ranks second in the number of championships won in El Salvador with fifteen titles. The two most successful managers in the club history are Conrado Miranda (1959, 1975, 1976) and Argentinian Hugo Coria (Apertura 1999, Apertura 2000, Clausura 2001) with three titles each, Juan Francisco Barraza (1972, 1983) and Victor Manuel Ochoa (1963, 1964) with two titles each, while Honduran Carlos Padilla (1960), Brazilian Zózimo (1968), Chilean Hernán Carrasco Vivanco (1986) and Serbian-Salvadoran Vladan Vićević (Clausura 2006) won one title each. They were also winners of the Copa President in 2000 and won the CONCACAF Champions League.

The members of the team that conquered the first championship in 1959 were Luis Alberto López, Rodolfo Fuentes, Justiniano Jiménez, Manuel Larios, Raúl Vásquez, Raúl Bonilla, Raúl Lizano, Juan Francisco Barraza, Juan Antonio Merlos, and Saúl Molina.

<text>A yard of ale or yard glass is a tall beer glass used for drinking around of beer, depending upon the diameter.

The glass is approximately long, shaped with a bulb at the bottom, and a widening shaft, which constitutes most of the height. 

The glass most likely originated in 17th-century England, where the glass was known also as a &quot;long glass&quot;, a &quot;Cambridge yard (glass)&quot; and an &quot;ell glass&quot;. It is associated by legend with stagecoach drivers, though was mainly used for drinking feats and special toasts.

Drinking a yard glass full of beer as quickly as possible is a traditional pub game; as with the toe of a beer boot, the bulb at the bottom of the glass makes it possible for the contestant to be splashed with a sudden rush of beer toward the end of the feat. The fastest drinking of a yard of ale in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; is 5 seconds.

==Description==
The glass is approximately , shaped with a bulb at the bottom and a widening shaft, which constitutes most of the height. In countries where the metric system is used, the glass may be . Because the glass is so long and in any case does not usually have a stable flat base, it is hung on the wall when not in use.

==History==

The glass most likely originated in 17th-century England, where the glass was known also as a &quot;long glass&quot;, a &quot;Cambridge yard (glass)&quot; and an &quot;ell glass&quot;. Such a glass was a testament to the glassblower&#x27;s skill as much as the drinker&#x27;s. John Evelyn records in his &quot;Diary&quot; the formal yet festive drinking of a yard of ale toast to James II at Bromley in Kent (now southeast London), 1685. 

Yard glasses can be found hanging on the walls of some English pubs, and there are a number of pubs named &quot;The Yard of Ale&quot; throughout the country.

==Usage==
Drinking a yard glass full of beer is a traditional pub game in the UK. Some ancient colleges at Oxford University have sconcing forfeits. While it is popularly said that former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was previously the world record holder for the fastest drinking of a yard of beer, Hawke did not set a world beer drinking record. The record he set was a minor record for students of University College, while much faster records were set elsewhere by other people.

In New Zealand, where it is referred to as a &quot;yardie&quot;, drinking a yard glass full of beer is traditionally performed at a 21st birthday by the celebrated person.

<doc id="1126492" wikidata="Q727758" url="?curid=1126492" title="Fender Precision Bass">
<text>The Fender Precision Bass (or &quot;P-Bass&quot;) is a model of electric bass guitar manufactured by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. In its standard, post-1957 configuration, the Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument usually equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard.

Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951. It was the first electric bass guitar to earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the best-selling and most-imitated electric bass guitars with considerable effect on the sound of popular music. Leo Fender designed the Precision bass for big band guitarists. Kansas City–based Roy Johnson of Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band was the first bassist to use the Precision in a concert setting. Music critic Leonard Feather wrote about this new development in &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, expressing surprise at hearing bass sounds from a guitar. Hampton soon replaced Johnson with bassist Monk Montgomery (Wes Montgomery&#x27;s brother) who was depicted in a sketch next to the Precision bass models inside Fender&#x27;s printed catalog in 1957–58. Montgomery helped to popularize the Precision during Hampton&#x27;s European tour of 1953, despite some sour responses from veteran double bass players who were quoted in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; saying the new electric bass was just &quot;a weak note amplified&quot; or &quot;an amplified plink-plonk.&quot;

== Design alterations and variants ==

The original Precision Bass of 1951 shared several of its design features with the Telecaster electric guitar, the main difference being its double cutaway body. The 1954 Stratocaster guitar with its contoured edges for comfort, was inspired by the Precision bass.
In turn the Precision Bass then borrowed design elements from the Stratocaster guitar: The model season of 1954/55 saw the introduction of a body shape and comfort carve similar to the Stratocaster.
The 1957 model had its headstock and pickguard redesigned to resemble the Stratocaster, and a rounder neck heel replacing the original square shape. A redesigned pickguard was made of a single layer of gold-anodized aluminium with 10 screw holes.

Most notably, in the 1957 model, the original single-coil pickup was replaced by the &quot;split-coil&quot; design with staggered pole pieces which is now known as the typical Precision pickup. Its two coils are typically connected in a hum-cancelling mode, a feature that was not emphasized by Fender at the time, as Seth Lover&#x27;s patent on the humbucker pickup had not yet expired.

In 1959 a glued-on rosewood fingerboard featuring &quot;clay&quot;-style dot position markers replaced the one-piece maple neck and remained standard until 1966/67, when the now-CBS-owned Fender company began to offer a separate, laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood fingerboards were then made of a veneered, round-laminated piece of wood and pearloid dot markers replaced the &quot;clay&quot;-style inlays introduced in 1959.

In 1960 the aluminum pickguard was replaced with a 13-screw celluloid design having three or four layers of black, white, white pearloid or with a brown &quot;tortoise-shell&quot; pattern). In the same year the newly designed Fender Jazz Bass was released.

The original Telecaster-derived design, with a few updates, was reintroduced in 1968 as the Fender Telecaster Bass. Within a few years, this evolved into a model distinctly different from the contemporary Precision Bass, alongside which it was marketed through 1979. Two artist-designed models use the Telecaster Bass body style; the Mike Dirnt Precision Bass, using today&#x27;s standard single split-coil pick-up, and the Sting Precision Bass, using a single coil pick-up as did the earliest design.
Since 1969 the one-piece maple neck option was offered on many Fender basses, with the rosewood fretboard as an alternative. Some Precision Basses made in the 1970s were also available with an unlined fretless rosewood, ebony or (usually) maple fingerboard, popularized by Sting and Tony Franklin.

In 1968, the headstock graphic was changed to a new &quot;waterslide&quot; design. In 1977, the &quot;Precision Bass&quot; wordmark was changed to a smaller, sans-serif design.

In the mid-1990s Fender briefly offered a fretless Precision Bass as a part of the first generation of the &quot;American Standard&quot; line. This variant was dropped at the end of the 20th century.


==Active electronics models==
From 1980 to 1984 various models of the Precision Bass were given new active pickups and a high-mass brass bridge. The Special (1980) featured a split-coil pickup with white covers, gold hardware, a 2-band EQ and an active/passive toggle switch. The Elite (1983) had one (Elite I) or two (Elite II) split-coil humbucking pickups, TBX tone circuit and a Schaller fine-tune bridge later used on the Plus Series models of the early 1990s. Some models were available with solid walnut body and stained ebony fretboard.

Precision Bass Lyte models were made in Japan and came to the market in late 1984. They had a smaller body shape and a modern C-shape maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets. They had an active P-J pickup configuration with a 2 band eq and pickup pan knob. They were produced until 1995.

The later 1980s and 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain models. The limited-edition Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was a luxurious version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted maple top with no pickguard, highly figured neck, 3 stacked knobs and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers. Only 400 of this model were produced. 
Some P-Basses with J-style bridge pickups used the Jazz Bass control layout—2 volumes and tone—and a side-mount jack socket. Others had the front pickup volume control moved forward to leave room for a top-mounted jack socket.
Other variants include dual stacked control knobs similar to that of an early 1960s Jazz Bass or a 3-way pickup selector switch (as used on the Tony Franklin Signature and Plus Series P-Basses).

==Model additions and name changes==
In 1983, Fender introduced the Standard Series with a new Bullet truss rod system, updated die-cast tuning machines, chrome hardware, white pickup covers and a single-ply white pick guard. The Headstock graphics were changed to reflect a blend of new and vintage. The Fender logo remained underneath the string guide but was changed to silver with a black outline. The &quot;Precision Bass&quot; wordmark was changed to a boldface font similar to the early 1960s model but remained to the right of the Fender logo.
From 1984 to 2000, this was referred to as the American Standard Precision Bass. The most notable visual change was the return to black pickup covers. The model was revamped in 1995. In 1996, a special run of 500 instruments was sold as the Limited Edition 50th Anniversary Precision Bass to celebrate the company&#x27;s anniversary. This model had gold hardware and a &quot;Fender 50&quot; stamp on the neck plate.

In 1984, Fender introduced a lower cost Standard Precision Bass model made in Japan. The Standard model was made in Japan until 1990 when Fender shifted operations to its new Mexican factory which produced the model from 1991 to 2018.

The American Deluxe Precision Bass was added to the revamped lineup in 1995. It had an Ash Body (offered until 2006), 18-volt preamp with 3-Band Active EQ and an added Humbucker in the bridge position.

The American Series Precision Bass was introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2008. From 2003 the S-1 switching system allowed the pickup coils to be switched from series to parallel, offering a wider tonal range, but this was discontinued in 2008 with the second generation of American Standard Series instruments. 2011 models bear a special &quot;Fender 60&quot; badge on the back of the body to celebrate the company&#x27;s 60th Anniversary.

In 2002, Fender added a new lower-cost American passive model series known as the Highway One. There were two iterations of this line - known as Highway 1 and Highway One. Highway 1 featured 60&#x27;s spaghetti logo, and a nut side truss rod adjustment port. They were painted with thin nitro lacquer. In 2006, it was updated with a BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles and a Greasebucket tone circuit. The Highway One Precision Bass featured &#x27;70s styling and thin satin nitro lacquer finish. The series remained available until it was discontinued in 2011.

The American Standard, American Deluxe (featuring a J-style humbucking pickup in the bridge position and an active 3-band EQ with an 18V power supply), Highway One and American Vintage series models were manufactured in Corona, California.

Following the success of the Aerodyne Jazz Bass, Fender briefly produced the Japanese-made Aerodyne Classic Precision Bass from 2006 to 2008. This model retained the basic shape of the classic Precision but had dramatically thinner contours. It had a basswood body with figured maple top and cream binding, Precision and Single-coil Jazz pickup combination and matching finish headstock.

On December 5, 2008, the American Standard Precision Bass was updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard. Other features included a high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight staggered tuning machine and a return to the knurled chrome flat-top control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with aged white Stratocaster control knobs.

As of March 23, 2010, all American Deluxe Precision Basses came with an N3 stacked-coil Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position, a 21-fret tinted maple neck with compound rosewood or maple fingerboard with white or black pearloid dot markers, an active/passive toggle switch, a high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage tuners, a stealth retainer bar for the A string and a bold CBS-era headstock decal. As of March 23, 2012 the American Standard Precision Bass (except the 5-string version) came with a Custom Shop 60&#x27;s P-Bass split-coil humbucking pickup. The 2012 color chart listed 3-Color Sunburst, Olympic White, Black, Candy Cola, Jade Pearl Metallic, Charcoal Frost Metallic as available finishes during that period. As of April 19, 2012 the American Standard Precision Basses are loaded with the Custom Shop &#x27;60s Precision Bass split single-coil pick-ups, a 20-fret graphite-reinforced maple neck with compound rosewood or maple fingerboard with white or black pearloid dot markers and a high-mass vintage bridge. It be bought as a 4 or 5 string bass. and were again made available in 2011; the 2004 color chart listed Aged Cherry Sunburst, Butterscotch Blonde and Tobacco Sunburst as available finishes during that period.

The Road Worn Series 50s P-Bass (introduced in 2009) features a distressed alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finish, a 1-ply gold anodized pickguard, a synthetic bone nut, American Vintage hardware, a split-coil humbucking pickup and a one-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 20 vintage frets.

Fender offered the Made-in-Mexico Blacktop Series from 2013 to 2014. Like Most of the other instruments in this series, the Blacktop Precision Bass was given high-output humbuckers. It also had a Hi-Mass Bridge, Vintage Jazz Bass Style Knobs (Volume, Volume, Tone) and a C-shape neck with 9.5&quot; Radius.

In May 2016, Fender brought back the American Elite Precision Bass to replace the American Deluxe series. The new model featured a Precision neck pickup combined with a 4th-generation Jazz noiseless pickup, 18-volt active circuit with 3-band EQ, passive bypass switch, Posiflex graphite support rods in the neck which. The 21-fret neck profile was a modern “C” shape at the genuine bone nut, and changed along the length of the neck to a modern D-shaped profile at the updated neck heel, with a compound radius of 9.5–14&quot;. Fender produced this bass until 2019.

In January 2017, Fender retired its American Standard line to be replaced by the American Professional Series. The Precision Bass was updated with new V-Mod pickups, upgraded tuners that featured increased sustain and better tuning stability, Narrow-Tall frets and a &#x27;63 P Bass profile neck. Fender ceased production of this model in 2020.

On June 19, 2018, Fender announced that it would be upgrading the build quality of its Made in Mexico Standard Series by replacing it with the Player Series instruments. The Player Precision Bass received new Alnico V pickups, modern C-shaped neck with a contemporary 9.5&quot; fingerboard radius, synthetic bone nut, new Fender standard open-gear tuners and a choice of Pau Ferro or Maple fretboards.

Fender updated the Elite Series on November 5, 2019, when it announced the arrival of the American Ultra Precision Bass. The Ultra retained similar features to the Elite Series model but now had updated body contouring and sculpted neck heel, Modern &quot;D&quot; Neck Profile with a compound radius of 10&quot;–14&quot;, new Ultra Noiseless pickups and a redesigned active/passive preamp. New finishes offered were Aged Natural, Mochaburst and Ultraburst with rosewood fretboard and Arctic Pearl with maple fretboard.

In October 2020 Fender introduced the American Professional II Precision Bass. Updates included a V-Mod II pickup which had varying amounts of Alnico in each pickup pole for a more balanced sound, new sculpted neck heel (similar to those seen previously on the Elite models), Super-Natural neck finish, Posiflex graphite rods for added neck stability and tapered-shaft turning machines. Fender also added new finishes were also added to the lineup: Dark Night, Mercury, Miami Blue and Mystic Surf Green. Finishes that remained in the lineup were 3-Color Sunburst, Black and Olympic White.

In July 2024, Fender released the Player II Precision Bass, adding a vintage-style tint to the neck and headstock, reintroduction of a Rosewood fingerboard option, rolled fingerboard edges and new vintage inspired colour options, Hialeah Yellow, Coral Red, Birch Green and Aquatone blue, added to the remaining 3 Tone Sunburst, Black and Arctic White from the former Player series. The text below the serial number now reads &#x27;Made in Ensenada&#x27;, as opposed to the prior Made in Mexico.

==Squier models==
Fender initially revived the Squier sub-brand to produce lower-cost guitars and basses in 1982. The first model the brand produced was the JV series which was made in Japan. This later became known as the Squier Traditional P-Bass and was retired in 1996.

The current basic model is the Affinity Precision Bass. This model was introduced in 1996 and was made in China. In more recent years, the Affinity Precision Bass PJ (named for its Precision-Jazz pickup configuration) was added to the lineup. The wordmark on the headstock graphic refers to this model as a Squier P-Bass. The PJ model is currently the only variation produced and released in the Affinity line.

Squier introduced the Vintage-Modified Series in 2007 to slot between the Affinity Series and the Made-In-Mexico Fenders. The Squier Vintage-Modified Precision Bass Had a Duncan Designed™ PB101 Split Single-Coil Pickup and late-70&#x27;s style headstock graphics. The Squier Vintage-Modified Precision Bass PJ was added in 2013 with Fender-designed Split Single-Coil Precision and Single-coil Jazz Pickups. Both models (along with the rest of the line) were subsequently replaced with Fender-Designed pickups before the Vintage-Modified line was discontinued altogether by 2019.

2020 saw the introduction of a short scale Precision. The Squier Mini Precision Bass has a 28.6&quot; (726mm) scale with 9.5&quot; radius and 1.5&quot; nut width. Similar to the previously introduced Mini Strat, the body remains faithful to the shape and contours of its full-size counterpart but is scaled down to correctly match with the neck.

==5-String variants==
Fender made an American Deluxe 5-string model with a split-coil neck pickup, a humbucking bridge pickup and a 3-band active EQ between 1998 and 2007. In 2008, Fender first produced a passive American Standard Precision Bass V with a single passive split-coil Precision pickup (three poles toward the neck, two poles toward the bridge) and single volume/tone. It remained in the same configuration when Fender transitioned to the American Professional Precision Bass V model in 2017 and the American Professional II Precision Bass V in 2020. Squier also produced a Standard version sporting two J-Bass pickups with alnico magnets. The company has also built a Korean-made Squier ProTone Precision V with dual humbuckers and gold hardware in the mid-1990s. In the mid-2010s, Squier produced the Vintage Modified Precision Bass V with the basic passive P bass single pickup and single volume/tone.

<text>The Fender Jazz Bass (often shortened to &quot;J-Bass&quot;) is the second model of electric bass created by Leo Fender. It is distinct from the Precision Bass in that its tone is brighter and richer in the midrange and treble with less emphasis on the fundamental frequency. The body shape is also different from the Precision Bass, in that the Precision Bass has a symmetrical lower bout on the body, designed after the Telecaster and Stratocaster lines of guitars, while the Jazz Bass has an offset lower bout, mimicking the design aesthetic of the Jaguar and Jazzmaster guitars.

==History==
First introduced in 1960 as the Deluxe Model, it borrowed design elements from the Jazzmaster guitar. It was renamed the Jazz Bass as Fender felt that its redesigned neck—narrower and more rounded than that of the Precision Bass—would appeal more to jazz musicians.

The Jazz Bass has two single coil pickups with two pole pieces per string. As well as having a slightly different, less symmetrical and more contoured body shape (known in Fender advertising as the &quot;Offset Waist Contour&quot; body), the Jazz Bass neck is noticeably narrower at the nut than that of the Fender Precision Bass. While the Precision Bass was originally styled similarly to the Telecaster guitar, the Jazz Bass&#x27; styling was inspired by the Jazzmaster guitar, with which the Jazz shared its offset body and sculpted edges, which differentiate it from other slab-style bass bodies.

The original intention of the instrument was to appeal to upright bass players. The original Jazz Bass had two stacked knob pots with volume and tone control for each pickup. Original instruments with this stacked configuration are highly valued in the vintage guitar market. In late 1961, it received three control knobs: one volume knob for each pickup and a third to control the overall tone. Despite this new feature, many stacked knob models were made until about 1962. Another feature the initial models had were the &quot;Spring Felt Mutes&quot;, which were present on basses from 1960 until 1962. The mutes were designed to dampen the overtones and the sustain; they were screwed in place between the bridge and aft pickup. Those felt mutes were not a tremendous success and were replaced by a cheaper, more simple foam mute glued underneath the bridge cover, as was used by the Precision Bass from 1963 onwards. Over the following years, as the use of mutes gradually declined, both the Precision and Jazz Bass models eventually began to be produced without bridge/tailpiece covers.

A number of cosmetic changes were made to the instrument when CBS purchased the Fender companies in 1965. During 1965/66, the Jazz Bass received bound rosewood fingerboards with pearloid dot position inlays (which replaced the older &quot;clay&quot;-style of the early 1960s) and oval-shaped tuning machines. Block-shaped fingerboard inlays and an optional maple fingerboard were introduced after 1966/67. At first, necks with rosewood fretboards received pearloid blocks/binding, and maple fretboard necks received black. Fender switched to pearloid blocks/binding on all necks in mid-to-late 1973. Fender also switched to the three-bolt neck &quot;micro-tilt adjustable&quot; neck and the &quot;bullet&quot; truss rod in mid-to-late 1974, before reverting to the more standard four-bolt neck fixing and dot-shaped fretboard markers in 1983. White pickup covers and a pickguard/control plate were introduced the same year. In 1986, Fender introduced the Japanese-made Fender Performer Bass, also with micro-tilt neck, designed by John Page and intended to be an Elite version of the Jazz Bass; however, the radical styling was not popular and production ceased the same year.

Two other changes that were more important to the tone of the instrument also occurred in the early 1970s. From 1960 until late 1970, the two pickups on the Jazz Bass were spaced apart. The bridge pickup was then moved closer to the bridge, creating a spacing of . Many players believe that this change contributed to a somewhat brighter tone from the bridge pickup. According to Fender itself, this change happened in 1972. However, Fender&#x27;s own history is clearly incorrect, as there are unquestionably examples of Jazz basses made in late 1970 that use the 4&quot; pickup spacing. Both 3.6&quot; and 4&quot; spacing are found in Jazz basses made in 1971, and there are even a few Jazz basses made in 1972 that use the older 3.6&quot; spacing. Around the same time, Fender began using ash for most of the instrument bodies. Prior to the early 70&#x27;s, most Jazz basses had bodies made of alder, except for those that were finished in a clear or (&quot;natural&quot;) finish - for those basses, ash was nearly always the wood of choice. In the early 70s, ash bodies became increasingly common, and by 1974 ash bodies were the rule, rather than the exception. Ash is generally thought to produce a somewhat brighter (and correspondingly less warm) tone than alder. By the mid-1970s, the combination of 4&quot; pickup spacing and the use of heavier ash bodies with maple fingerboards combined to produce a notably brighter tone than that produced by Jazz basses from the 60s.

American Standard Jazz Basses produced between 1989 and mid-1994 featured a larger body shape, a &#x27;curved&#x27; neck plate set into a chambered pocket for greater sustain and a 22-fret neck, similar to that of a Precision Bass Plus, with a standard vintage-style top-load bridge, two separate volumes and a master TBX tone circuit.

Usually known as &quot;Boner&quot; Jazz Basses, these early American Standard models (designed by George Blanda, who was Fender&#x27;s senior R&amp;D engineer during that period) were discontinued in 1994 and shouldn&#x27;t be confused with the Fender Jazz Bass Plus, which has the same 22-fret neck design, but utilizes a different (downsized) body styling, Lace Sensor pickups, Schaller &quot;Elite&quot; fine-tuner bridge on the four-string model or Gotoh Hardware high-mass bridge on the 5-string model, and Phil Kubicki-designed active electronics. Unlike the Fender Precision Bass Plus, which had an optional maple neck, the Boner Jazz Bass was offered only with a rosewood fingerboard.

The Jazz Plus Bass was available with an alder body and the option of a natural-finish ash body on the four-string model for a $100 upcharge, either a maple or rosewood fretboard on the four-string and pau ferro (an exotic hardwood whose tone is brighter than rosewood yet warmer than ebony) on the five-string. The Jazz Plus debuted in 1989 (the five-string model was released in 1990), but was discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the USA Deluxe Series Jazz Bass the following year.

 A fourth push button control is available on American-made Jazz Basses produced between mid-2003 until 2008. Known as the &quot;S-1 Switch&quot;, this feature allows the pickups to operate in standard, parallel wiring, or alternatively in series wiring when the switch is depressed. While in series, both pickups function as a single unit with one volume control, giving the Jazz Bass a sound more similar to the Precision Bass.

The two pickups are built to be opposite from each other in both magnetic polarity and electrical phase, so that when heard together, hum is cancelled—the humbucking effect. The Highway One Jazz Bass is a moderately priced American-made bass introduced in 2003, featuring a Leo Quan BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, 1970s styling, and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006.

In 2008, the American Series models were replaced by a new American Standard line, which greatly differs from the first-generation American Standard Series basses introduced in 1994. The 2008 American Standard Jazz Bass retained the &quot;American Series&quot; rolled-edge neck with highly detailed nut and fret work, as well as the familiar rounded body shape with the vintage body radius, but deleted the S-1 switching system and incorporated a new high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage-style tuning machines, a richer and deeper neck tint, gloss maple or rosewood fingerboard and satin back for smooth playability. It also has a thinner finish undercoat that lets the body breathe and improves resonance. In March 2012, Fender updated the American Standard Jazz Bass (except the five-string version) with Custom Shop 1960s Jazz Bass pickups.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body, finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer, and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument&#x27;s history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era thumb rest and bridge pickup positioning, modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods.

==Design features==

The Jazz Bass has a bright sound, with more high end than the Precision Bass. This makes it ideal for slap playing as well as finger-style players. This bright sound is because of the two pickups at different points in the string&#x27;s length. The bridge pickup gives a tone with more treble, while the neck pickup will yield a rounder sound. The ability to blend the volume of both pickups allows for a wider variety of tones than the Precision Bass can produce. Pickups are RWRP (reverse wound, reverse polarity) from one another, so all hum will be canceled when both pickups are at full volume.

Having both pickups cranked up at full volume produces the classic scooped, &quot;growling&quot; sound which many players—such as Marcus Miller and Will Lee—use for slap bass playing. This sound is the product of certain frequencies from both pickups being out of phase and cancelling each other, leaving a &quot;scoop&quot; on the midrange. This is similar to what happens on some guitars when one blends the sounds from two different pickups, such as the Fender Stratocaster.

Some &quot;Deluxe&quot; Jazz Bass models feature an active pre-amp (usually with three bands of equalization) in place of a single passive tone control; these basses have three separate equalizer controls: bass and treble responses are controlled by the base and top of a stacked double pot, while midrange is controlled by a second knob. They came with 22 frets, abalone dot position inlays and an 18-volt power supply on some models. Known as the Jazz Bass Deluxe since being introduced as part of a major reworking of Fender&#x27;s Electric Bass lineup in 1995, they have been renamed the American Deluxe Jazz Bass.

The American Deluxe Jazz Bass (available in four-string fretted and fretless, five-string fretted and left-hand versions) featured two samarium-cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, designed by Bill Lawrence. Fender used downsized bodies to accommodate the 22-fret neck and reshaped the pickguard with nine screw holes.

American Deluxes produced between 1995 and 1999 were initially available with &quot;single-pole&quot; pickups designed by John Suhr. These were soon changed to the Bill Turner-designed dual-coil Ceramic Noiseless units with nickel-plated (gold-plated on certain models) polepieces until the advent of the Bill Lawrence-designed Samarium Cobalt series in 2004.

Other refinements include a strings-through-body/top-load bridge, &quot;Posiflex&quot; graphite neck support rods, rolled fingerboard edges, highly detailed nut- and fretwork. Five-string versions are presented with a 4+1 tuner arrangement and two Hipshot string trees since 2002. The asymmetrical five-bolt neck plate, along with the smooth contoured heel allow much easier access to the upper registers. Bound fingerboards with pearloid block inlays were added with the introduction of the American Deluxe Jazz Bass FMT &amp; QMT in late 2001, featuring flamed or quilted maple tops and gold-plated hardware. Fender discontinued these models in 2007.

In 2010 the American Deluxe Jazz Bass was updated with a pair of N3 stacked-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, an active/passive toggle switch, CBS styling and a 21-fret bound compound radius maple neck featuring rosewood or maple fingerboards with rectangular block inlays. Other features include Hipshot vintage lightweight tuners, &quot;Strong Arm&quot; string retainer bar for the A and low B strings, and Fender&#x27;s High Mass Vintage (HMV) bridge. The American Deluxe series was discontinued in 2016.

The American Elite Jazz Bass, introduced in 2016, sports a compound modern C-to-D neck shape, fourth-generation noiseless pickups, a &quot;spoke-wheel&quot; truss rod system for easier neck relief adjustments and a new asymmetrical neck heel. It is offered with a compound radius ebony (since 2017) or maple fingerboard, in 4 and 5-string versions.

The Mexican Deluxe Active Jazz Bass combines many of the features of the American Deluxe models with a traditional Standard Jazz Bass body, vintage-style hardware, a contoured neck heel and a 12&quot;-radius 20-fret rosewood or maple fingerboard. It comes in 4 and 5-string versions and sports a three-band active circuit powered by two dual-coil ceramic Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups and an 18V power supply with an active/passive switch (as of 2016).

The Custom Classic model was made at the Fender Custom Shop. This Custom Shop Jazz Bass was a cross between the American Vintage and the American Deluxe series. Features include an oversized select alder or premium ash body, a modern 34&quot;-scale C-shape maple neck with an unbound rosewood, pau ferro or maple fingerboard featuring triangular pearloid block inlays and 21 medium-jumbo frets. Available in four- and five-string versions, all Custom Classic Jazz Basses came with a pair of custom-wound dual-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, a three-band active preamp, five-bolt neck plate, 18V power supply and a Deluxe string-through-body/top-load bridge with milled nickel-plated brass saddles. Models manufactured prior to 2003 (formerly known as &quot;American Classics&quot;) were identical to the mid-1990s American Deluxe basses in appearance, excepting the 22-fret bound maple neck featuring a rosewood fretboard and white block inlays. Fender discontinued the five-string version in 2009. The Custom Classic four-string Jazz Bass has been renamed Custom Active Jazz Bass as of 2010, featuring Fender&#x27;s high-mass vintage (HMV) bridge and a 1960s Jazz Bass &quot;U&quot; shape neck.

The Standard Jazz Bass model is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, Baja California along with the other Standard Series guitars (replaced by the Player models in 2018). On December 5, 2008, the Standard J-Bass has given CBS era-style decals, a three-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard (also available in a fretless version with a rosewood fingerboard and 20 inlaid white fretline markers). Other features included two staggered bi-pole single-coil pickups and a return to the black bakelite control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with black Stratocaster control knobs. The five-string version (introduced in 1992), available with pao ferro or rosewood fingerboard and a five-in-line tuner configuration with Gotoh Mini machineheads (c. 2006), has been updated with a tinted maple neck featuring a dark rosewood fingerboard and a 4+1 tuner configuration with Fender/Ping tuning machines as of 2009. In 2017 Fender switched to pao ferro fingerboards before discontinuing the Standard series in 2018.

All five-string Jazz basses came with pau ferro fretboard since 1990 (some US Deluxe models were also available with a plain maple neck option). Fender offers its 5-string basses with rosewood or maple fretboard as of 2006 after discontinuing the pau ferro fingerboard option in late 2005. In 2008, Fender introduced the fretted and fretless Steve Bailey signature models, its first six-string Jazz Basses to feature a 9.5&quot; to 14&quot; compound-radius ebony fingerboard.

==24-fret Jazz Bass==
In July 2005, Fender introduced its first 24-fret bass since the Fender Performer Bass, the Fender Jazz Bass 24. The Jazz Bass 24 featured a sleek alder body, a 34&quot;-scale length, modern C-shaped maple neck with a two-octave rosewood fingerboard, abalone dot inlays, 24 medium-jumbo frets, Hipshot-licensed tuners, Fender/Gotoh High Mass top-loading bridge, two custom-wound Seymour Duncan SJB-3 Quarter Pound pickups, a passive/active push/pull volume knob and a 3-band active EQ with a &quot;slap&quot; mid-scoop switch. It was available in the Fender price list as part of the Deluxe Series line, with Cherry Sunburst (discontinued as of 2007) and Tobacco Sunburst finishes over a quilted maple top and chrome-plated hardware. The 5-string version was introduced in 2007.

In 2008, Fender offered both the four- and five-string versions of the 24-fret Jazz Bass in a stealthy Flat Black finish (with matching headstocks and hardware). These 2-octave Jazz Basses were gone from the Fender pricelist as of 2009.

The Steve Bailey 6-string signature model produced between 2009 and 2011 also had a 2-octave fingerboard and was tuned BEADGC

Fender 24-fret Jazz Basses were made in Korea.

==Fender Jaguar Bass==

In 2005, Fender introduced the Fender Jaguar Bass, as of 2008 available in Hot Rod Red, Olympic White, Sunburst and Black finishes, with a three-ply white or tortoise pickguard. This is a variation on the traditional Jazz Bass design—differences being that it has only one master volume and tone, but additional on/off switches for pickup selection, series/parallel switching, and a two-band active preamp with bypass switch.

The Jaguar bass retains the slim Jazz neck, bi-pole pickups, Jazzmaster/Jaguar body design and the trademark Jazz Bass growl.

As of 2008, the Jaguar Bass comes in Olympic White and three-colour Sunburst finishes, together with a four-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard. These colours were previously available only for the Japanese domestic market.

In 2012, Fender also introduced the Reverse Jaguar Bass in its line of Pawn Shop Series guitars. This special issue features a reversed body stock orientation, and also reverses the humbucking pickups for a unique tone.

Fender also offers several models of the Jaguar Bass in the Squier line (and an American Standard version since 2014), most with a Precision/Jazz &quot;P-J&quot; pickup configuration.

<doc id="1126510" wikidata="Q134108" url="?curid=1126510" title="Mount Merapi">
<text>Mount Merapi (, ) is an active stratovolcano located on the border between the province of Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548. It is located approximately north of Yogyakarta city which has a population of 2.4 million. Thousands of people live on the flanks of the volcano, with villages as high as above sea level.

Smoke can often be seen rising from the mountaintop, and several eruptions have caused fatalities. A pyroclastic flow from a large explosion killed 27 people on 22 November 1994, mostly in the town of Muntilan, west of the volcano. Another large eruption occurred in 2006, shortly before the Yogyakarta earthquake. In light of the hazards that Merapi poses to populated areas, it was designated as one of the Decade Volcanoes, which are considered worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to densely populated areas.

On the afternoon of 25 October 2010, Merapi erupted on its southern and southeastern slopes. A total of 353 people were killed over the next month, while 350,000 were forced to flee their homes; most of the damage was done by pyroclastic flows, while heavy rain on 4 November created lahars which caused further damage. Most of the fissures had ceased erupting by 30 November, and four days later the official threat level was lowered. Merapi&#x27;s characteristic shape was changed during the eruptions, with its height lowered to .

Since 2010, Merapi had experienced several smaller eruptions, most noticeably two phreatic eruptions which occurred on 18 November 2013 and 11 May 2018. The first and larger of these, caused by a combination of rainfall and internal activity, saw smoke issued up to a height of . There have been several small eruptions since the beginning of 2020, which are of great interest to volcanologists.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Merapi&quot; is a compound of Sanskrit &quot;Meru&quot; meaning &quot;mountain&quot; with Javanese &quot;api&quot; which means &quot;fire&quot;. Thus &quot;Merapi&quot; can be loosely translated as &quot;Mountain of Fire&quot; or &quot;Fire Mountain&quot;.

==History==
===Geological history===

Merapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern Java. It is situated at a subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian plate is subducting under the Sunda plate. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire—a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia. Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing lava emitted was basaltic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous andesitic lavas often generating lava domes. Dome collapse has often generated pyroclastic flows, and larger explosions, which have resulted in eruption columns, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.

Typically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10–15 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.

The very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with ash. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the Hindu Kingdom of Mataram; however, the evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.

In April, increased seismicity at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano&#x27;s cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano&#x27;s neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of , compared to the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated.

By early May, active lava flows had begun. On 11 May, with lava flow beginning to be constant, some 17,000 people were ordered to be evacuated from the area and on 13 May, Indonesian authorities raised the alert status to the highest level, ordering the immediate evacuation of all residents on the mountain. Many villagers defied the dangers posed by the volcano and returned to their villages, fearing that their livestock and crops would be vulnerable to theft. Activity calmed by the middle of May.

On 27 May, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck roughly southwest of Merapi, killing at least 5,000 and leaving at least 200,000 people homeless in the Yogyakarta region, heightening fears that Merapi would &quot;blow&quot;. The quake did not appear to be a long-period oscillation, a seismic disturbance class that is increasingly associated with major volcanic eruptions. A further 11,000 villagers were evacuated on 6 June as lava and superheated clouds of gas poured repeatedly down its upper slopes towards Kaliadem, a location that was located southeast of Mt. Merapi. The pyroclastic flows are known locally as &quot;wedhus gembel&quot; (Javanese for &quot;shaggy goat&quot;). There were two fatalities as the result of the eruption.

===2010 eruption===


In late October, the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Geological Agency (CVGHM), (&quot;Indonesian language&quot;—Pusat Vulkanologi &amp; Mitigasi Bencana Geologi, Badan Geologi-PVMBG), reported that a pattern of increasing seismicity from Merapi had begun to emerge in early September.

Observers at Babadan west and Kaliurang south of the mountain reported hearing an avalanche on 12 September. On 13 September, white plumes were observed rising above the crater. Lava dome inflation, detected since March, increased from background levels of to per day to a rate of per day on 16 September. On 19 September, earthquakes continued to be numerous, and the next day CVGHM raised the Alert Level to 2 (on a scale of 1–4). Lava from Mount Merapi in Central Java began flowing down the Gendol River on 23–24 October signalling the likelihood of an imminent eruption.

On 25 October, the Indonesian government raised the alert for Mount Merapi to its highest level (4) and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground. People living within a zone were told to evacuate. The evacuation orders affected at least 19,000 people; however, the number that complied at the time remained unclear to authorities. Officials said about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 23–24 October, and that the magma had risen to about below the surface due to the seismic activity

After a period of multiple eruptions considered to exceed the intensity and duration of those in 1872 on 10 November 2010 the intensity and frequency of eruptions was noticed to subside. By this time, 153 people had been reported to have been killed and 320,000 were displaced. Later the eruptive activities again increased requiring a continuation of the Level 4 alert and continued provision of exclusion zones around the volcano. By 18 November the death toll had increased to 275. The toll had risen to 324 by 24 November and Syamsul Maarif, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) explained that the death toll had risen after a number of victims succumbed to severe burns and more bodies were found on the volcano&#x27;s slopes.

In the aftermath of the more intensive eruptive activities in late November, Yogyakarta&#x27;s Disaster Management Agency reported that there were about 500 reported cases of eruption survivors in Sleman district suffering from minor to severe psychological problems, and about 300 cases in Magelang. By 3 December the death toll had risen to 353.

On 3 December, the head of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Dr. Syamsul Maarif, M. Si, accompanied by the head of the Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation CVGHM (PVMBG), Dr. Surono made a joint press release at the BNPB Command Post in Yogyakarta. At 09.00 am that day, the CVGHM (PVMBG) lowered the status of Mount Merapi to the level of Caution Alert (Level III). They clarified that with this alert level the potential of hot ash clouds and projected incandescent material remained. The Geological Agency provided several recommendations including that there would be no community activities in the disaster prone areas and proclaimed an ongoing exclusion zone of radius.

===2018 eruption===

A phreatic eruption began on the morning of 11 May, prompting the evacuation of areas within a radius of the volcano. Adisutjipto International Airport in Yogyakarta was closed due to the eruption&#x27;s ash plume. This eruption initiated a new phase of dome growth. It led to new evacuations at Merapi in November 2020. The danger of pyroclastic flows was increasing and expanding.

===2021 eruption===

Eruptions started on 4 January causing evacuations of the Yogyakarta region. The geological authority had invoked the second-highest alert level in November after sensors picked up increasing activity warning the situation could become more unstable. On 27 March, another small eruption occurred, spewing lava and creating pyroclastic flows. Merapi began erupting once again on 8 August 2021, sending new lava flows down the slope of the volcano. On 16 August, the volcano erupted again, belching a cloud of ash into the air as lava flowed down its crater. The explosions spewed clouds as far as 3.5 kilometres (2 miles) from the rumbling volcano, blanketing local communities in grey ash.

On 9 December, a pyroclastic flow traveled along the Bebeng River for a distance of 2.2 km. This comes just as Mount Semeru erupted in an unrelated event, killing at least 43 people.

===2023 eruption===
An eruption started on 11 March at around 12 p.m. local time (Western Indonesia Time, GMT+7). A lava flow up to 7 kilometers long and a column of hot cloud rising up to 100 meters high were observed. Local authorities advised residents living in Merapi&#x27;s slope to stay at least 7 kilometers away from the crater.

===2024 eruption===
An eruption occurred on 19 January starting at 6:59 a.m. local time, with six pyroclastic flows reaching up to 2 kilometers being recorded. On 21 January, the volcano emitted a lava flow up to 2 kilometers long and a column of hot cloud rising up to 100 meters. Authorities advised residents living in Merapi&#x27;s slope to stay at least 7 kilometers away from the crater.

==Monitoring==

Mount Merapi is the site of a very active volcano monitoring program. Seismic monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between Merbabu and Merapi), and Plawangan monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into Kaliurang as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.

The eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 seismographs currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the hypocentres of tremors and quakes.

A zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5 km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the magma reservoir which feeds the eruptions.

Other measurements taken on the volcano include magnetic measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.

Lahars (a type of mudflow of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50 mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.

== Check dam ==
There are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged. The cost for recovery is about Rp 1 trillion ($116 million).

==Sterile zone==
Following the 2010 eruption, three Indonesian government departments declared a prohibited zone in which nobody can permanently stay and no infrastructure is allowed in 9 villages (dusun): Palemsari, Pangukrejo, Kaliadem, Jambu, Kopeng, Petung, Kalitengah Lor, Kalitengah Kidul and Srunen, all in Cangkringan district.

==National park==

In 2004, an area of 6,410 hectares around Mount Merapi was established as a national park. The decision of the Ministry of Forestry to declare the park has been subsequently challenged in court by The Indonesian Forum for Environment, on grounds of lack of consultation with local residents. During the 2006 eruption of the volcano it was reported that many residents were reluctant to leave because they feared their residences would be confiscated for expansion of the national park, meaning they would not have a house.

==Museum==
*Merapi Museum Center, Kaliurang Street Kilometer 25.7, Pakem subdistrict, Sleman, Yogyakarta. A replica of Merapi&#x27;s Post 2010 eruption has been created and Indonesian student visits to the museum has increased 30 percent since the latest eruption.

==Mythology==

Merapi is very important to the Javanese people, especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.

===Creation===

Although most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.
It is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, Java was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by Batara Guru) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred keris at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means &quot;fire of Rama and Permadi.&quot; 

===Spirit &quot;Kraton&quot; of Merapi===
The Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (&quot;makhluk halus&quot;). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in Javanese &quot;kraton&quot;) used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the Yogyakarta Sultanate, complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.
Besides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of ancestors who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (&quot;abdi dalem&quot;), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give prophecies or warnings.

===Spirits of Merapi===
To keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly take offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of Yogyakarta&#x27;s coronation. For the Yogyakarta Sultanate, Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north–south axis line between Merapi&#x27;s peak and the Indian Ocean, referred by locals as the Southern Ocean. The sacred axis is signified by Merapi peak in the north, the Tugu Yogyakarta monument near Yogyakarta main train station, the axis runs along Malioboro street to Northern Alun-alun (square) across Keraton Yogyakarta (sultan&#x27;s palace), Southern Alun-alun, all the way to Bantul and finally reaching Samas and Parangkusumo beach on the estuary of Opak river and the Indian Ocean. This sacred axis connected the hyangs or spirits of mountain revered since ancient times—often identified as &quot;Mbah Petruk&quot; by Javanese people—The Sultan of Yogyakarta as the leader of the Javanese kingdom, and Nyi Roro Kidul as the queen of the Southern Ocean, the female ocean deity revered by Javanese people and also mythical consort of Javanese kings.

<text>The Primera División of the &#x27; (&quot;Professional Football League&quot;), more commonly known as La Liga Mayor or La Primera&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is the top professional football league in El Salvador.

It was established in 1947, and in 2011 had 10 clubs. Initially the league was run as a year-long tournament, but since 1998 there are two tournaments each year, much like in many other football leagues in the Americas.

The Apertura season runs from August to December, while the Clausura season runs from February to July.

Of the 56 teams to have competed in the league, FAS has won the title 19 times, followed by Alianza (18), Aguila (17), Firpo and Isidro Metapan (10)

==Competition format==
La Liga Mayor follows the usual double round-robin format.

During the course of a given season (Apertura or Clausura), each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 22 games.

Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the top eight clubs at the end of the season progressing through to the finals.

If points are equal between two or more clubs, goal difference usually determines their placement.

Although when it comes to qualifying for the finals, if the team in eighth and ninth spot are equal on points, then a &quot;Repechaje&quot; or Playoff is needed to determine which team gains entry into finals.

A system of relegation exists between the &quot;Primera División&quot; and the &quot;Segunda División&quot;.

In May each year, at the conclusion of both the &quot;apertura&quot; and &quot;clausura&quot; seasons, the team with the fewest points on aggregate over both seasons, is automatically relegated to the &quot;Segunda División&quot;.

===CONCACAF Central American Cup===
La Liga Mayor has three guaranteed spots in the CONCACAF Central American Cup. The winner of each &quot;apertura&quot; and &quot;clausura&quot; season gains automatic entry into this tournament. To determine the third spot, aggregate points over both seasons is used, the best no-champion team in the season qualified to the tournament. If the same team is to win both the &quot;apertura&quot; and &quot;clausura&quot; seasons, the last spot belongs to the second best no-champion team in the season.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1921, the Salvadoran Sports Commission (Comisión Nacional de Educación Física) held its first National Sports Week. Although initially this event did not include any participation from football clubs, it would go on to be the basis of what would grow to be the Liga Mayor of today. In 1924, due to high demand, the commission included a football tournament in the annual Sports Week. Due to the enormous success of this event, it was decided that starting in 1926 the Sports Week tournament would in turn become the country&#x27;s official National Football Championship. The championship was to be contended by three teams who represent the three different zones of the country playing in a double round robin format. The first three teams to compete in the tournament were, Nequepio (Central Zone), Chinameca Sporting Club (Eastern Zone) and Olímpic (Western Zone). This format was used until 1930.

===Controversy===
Controversy occurred after the 1929–30 championship when finalists Excélsior F.C. (who represented the western zone) complained that the second leg of the final against Hércules should not be registered, as they felt that the referee in that game had helped Hércules win the title. The Sports Commission did not agree and the result was not changed. As a result, Excélsior F.C. withdrew from the tournament and Hércules was crowned champion. This led to there being talk of corruption from event organisers against teams from the western part of the country, and as a result teams from that zone refused to take part in any of the following Championships. Because of this there was no national playoff held again until 1937.

===Return of the National Championship===
The national championship returned to its original format in 1937, but was short lived, as once again, teams complained of there still being corruption within the tournament. Again as a result, there was no national championship during 1939 and 1941. Although no national championship was played, there was still regional championships which over time are now considered to be legitimate national championships.

===Introduction of a league format===
In 1947 the Salvadoran Football Federation tried to organize a National Championship in league format, but this proved to be unsuccessful and the tournament was suspended after only a few rounds. It proved to be more successful the following season, but was postponed once again in 1949. Although this new format did not begin very well, because of a lack of organisation, it did prove to work very well during the 1950 championship, and throughout the 1950s.

===The league begins to form===
The 1950s saw interest in the league begin to grow nationwide and although the league did have some problems, with teams dropping out at the end of any given season, it would not affect the league as a whole, as there were various new teams that were anxious to take part in the league and take the place of those that had left. In 1955, league organisers announced that the championship would now be played out in a double round robin format, with a maximum of 10 teams taking part in the league. This year also saw the introduction of promotion and relegation into the league.

===Switch to Apertura/Clausura format===
In 1998, league officials decided to change the league format from a yearlong tournament to an Apertura/Clausura schedule, with the hope that it would garner more interest in the league and give a chance for its player to rest between seasons.

===Annex Major League Soccer El Salvador===
These are the three league format that existed in Salvadoran national football league until now

*Short Tournament (1926–1946)

Three regional champions, faced each other in the national championship. Each team represented a different section of the country (West zone, Central zone, East zone).

*League System (1947–1997)

This format consisted of all against all and twelve national teams participated.

*Apertura/Clausura format (1999–present)

The current league format, consisting of two short football tournaments annually mind between opening and closing ceremonies are held.

===New league format 2015/2016===
For the 2015–16 season, the league will have 12 teams leaving behind 10 team years. With the approval of this new format, major league soccer Cadre El Salvador, seeks to be more competitive and bring football to more people throughout the country.

==Primera Division clubs==
The following 11 teams are competing in the 2024–25 Primera División season.



==Sponsorship==
ON January 2023, league president Pedro David Hernández announced Instituto Nacional de los Deportes de El Salvador &quot;INDES&quot; as the official sponsor, with the goal of modernizing the league&#x27;s image. The contract was signed for seven years worth estimated 9 million dollars

Since 2021, Pioneer Deportes has been the official match ball manufacturer. In 2021, the contract was extended for three years concluding until 2024. In 2024, Molten was announced to be the new ball sponsor.

<doc id="1126518" wikidata="Q6168351" url="?curid=1126518" title="Jazz bass">
<text>Jazz bass is the use of the double bass or electric bass guitar to improvise accompaniment (&quot;comping&quot;) basslines and solos in a jazz or jazz fusion style. Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low-pitched walking basslines that outlined the chord progressions of the songs. From the 1920s and 1930s Swing and big band era, through 1940s Bebop and 1950s Hard Bop, to the 1960s-era &quot;free jazz&quot; movement, the resonant, woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz big bands.

Beginning in the early 1950s, some jazz bass players began to use the electric bass guitar to replace the double bass. The electric bass guitar, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage, gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified electric instruments of rock music, creating jazz fusion. Jaco Pastorius is considered by many to be the finest exponent of jazz on the electric bass, via his work with Weather Report, Joni Mitchell, Pat Metheny and others.

Most jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the bass guitar, although the ability to &quot;double&quot; (play both instruments) is common. A small number of players, such as Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci, have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments. Whether a jazz bassist is comping (accompanying) with a walking bassline or soloing, or playing on a double bass or a bass guitar, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and timefeel that creates a sense of swing and groove.

== Double bass ==
Beginning around 1890, the African-American communities in early New Orleans used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches, ragtime, and dixieland music. This ensemble was initially a marching band with sousaphone (or occasionally bass saxophone) supplying the bass line. As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and brothels, the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments. Many early bassists doubled on both the brass bass and string bass, as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played walking basslines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes.

Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic slap sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well.

Double bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player Jimmy Blanton, who played with Duke Ellington, and Oscar Pettiford, who pioneered the instrument&#x27;s soloistic use in Bebop. The &quot;cool&quot; style of jazz was influenced by players such as Scott LaFaro and Percy Heath, whose solos were very melodic.

Free jazz was influenced by the composer/bassist Charles Mingus (who also contributed to hard bop) and Charlie Haden, best known for his work with Ornette Coleman. In the 1950s, some big band bandleaders began to ask their upright players to use the then-newly available Fender bass, the first widely available electric bass. In the 1970s, as jazz and rock music were blended by performers to create the &quot;fusion&quot; genre, players such as Jaco Pastorius began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass.

Apart from jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz, the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s. The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted bass guitar. The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass, because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal frets. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that the sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings. The solid body upright, also known as a &quot;stick&quot; bass or &quot;EUB&quot; variation is still widely used by bass players in salsa and timba bands, because its sound is so well suited to those styles. The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass, making touring and travelling easier, and its solid (or mostly solid) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a bass amp without feedback.

=== Playing techniques ===
In jazz, since the 1950s, the double bass is usually played with amplification and it is mostly played with the fingers, &quot;pizzicato&quot; style, except during some solos, where players may use the bow. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.

Using amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise). While jazz double bass players use amplification, they typically use much smaller, lower-powered bass amplifiers and smaller speaker cabinets than those used by an electric bass player playing in a jazz fusion show. An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12&quot; combo amp to the gig. When a small jazz combo is playing in a small jazz club, the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification, so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound; if that same band were to play on a huge jazz festival mainstage, all of the bass tone reaching the audience&#x27;s ears will be from the sound reinforcement system.

An unamplified acoustic bass&#x27; tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument&#x27;s hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a preamplifier, impedance-matching device, and/or a Direct Injection (DI box) box before it is routed to the PA system, electronic effects, or the bass instrument amplifier.

In traditional jazz and swing it is sometimes played in the &quot;slap style&quot;. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are &quot;slapped&quot; against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a snare drum-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolate two, or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line.

=== Variants ===
In both jazz and jazz fusion bands, some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the electric upright bass (abbreviated EUB and sometimes also called stick bass). The stick bass is also widely used in salsa, because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music, even in studio recording. It is an electronically amplified version of the double bass that has a minimal or &#x27;skeleton&#x27; body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the double bass so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. As well, an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent. The scale length of EUBs varies: some scales are 42&quot;, similar to most double basses, whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30&quot; like a short scale bass guitar. The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB.

Solid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without electronic amplification. Hollow-bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice. However, since hollow-bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a double bass, they cannot reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier. To amplify the EUB, the string vibrations are sensed with a pickup. Early EUBs used magnetic pickups similar to those in electric guitars, or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups (e.g., the Ampeg &quot;Baby Bass&quot;). Many modern EUBs use piezoelectric pickups located in the bridge or a combination of pickup types. The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and equalized with a preamplifier and then sent to a bass amplifier or a PA system. For silent practice an EUB can also be connected to headphones.

Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to &quot;roll off&quot; the treble frequencies or &quot;notch out&quot; the &quot;scratchy-sounding&quot; frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to audio feedback than the double bass when amplified. To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be radiussed (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.

== Electric bass ==
The electric bass was introduced to jazz in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson, and later Monk Montgomery, first used the instrument in Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band. When the electric bass is used in jazz, it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the bass is used to accompany, it may be used to perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and &quot;jazz standards&quot;, in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass.

The electric bass player can play all of the same types of bass lines played by her upright bass cousin. However, due to the design of the electric bass as a guitar-family instrument, it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass. For example, an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid, syncopated sixteenth notes. For Latin or salsa tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play challenging, fast-moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove.

In a fusion band, electric bass players have to provide a solid, heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer, electric guitarist (amplified through a guitar amp) and synthesizer or electric piano player performing (amplified through a keyboard amp) are all playing. As well, fusion bands are more likely to play a rock-size venue, such as a large club or theatre, than a small jazz club. To provide a good bass sound, a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful bass amplifier and a larger speaker cabinet than an upright player would use, such as a 4X10&quot; cabinet, or even two 4X10&quot; cabinets.
In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called &quot;blowing&quot; in jazz parlance. Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are Jaco Pastorius, Victor Wooten, and Marcus Miller.

=== Fretted and fretless bass guitars ===
One of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with frets on the fingerboard or not. On a fretted bass, metal frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. Fretless basses have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the double bass. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player&#x27;s finger. The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of glissando, vibrato and microtonal intonations such as quarter tones and just intonation.

In a small combo, the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes. In a band with a bandleader, the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass. Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing. While fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion, bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist Steve Di Giorgio.

Bill Wyman takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass guitar by removing the frets. The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius created his own fretless bass guitar by removing the frets from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.

Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have &quot;fret line&quot; markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance sustain, and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as &quot;boutique&quot; or custom-made instruments.

== Alternative instruments ==

While the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass (or a related instrument such as an electric upright bass) or the electric bass to supply the &quot;low end&quot;, there are some exceptions. In jazz organ trios, a Hammond organ player, such as Joey de Francesco, performs the basslines using the bass pedalboard or their lower manual, along with a drummer and a saxophonist. In some jazz fusion groups, the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a bass synthesizer or other keyboard. As well, in some duos and other small groups, the basslines may be provided by a piano player; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer, the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer&#x27;s voice. Similarly, in some duos or trios, a jazz guitarist may play basslines, a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven-string guitar with a low &quot;B&quot; string. In traditional Dixieland or New Orleans-style jazz groups, the basslines may be played by a tuba or other low brass instrument.

<text>San Salvador Fútbol Club was a professional football club located in San Salvador, El Salvador that participated in Primera División de Fútbol Profesional from 2002 to 2008.

The club played its home games at Estadio Cuscatlán, which is the largest stadium in El Salvador.

==History==
The club was only founded on 7 January 2002 and bought the licence of ADET to compete in the 2002 Clausura season of the Salvadoran Premier Division. They boasted an impressive squad of Salvadoran internationals, most prominently Salvadoran legend Mágico González, and won the Clausura 2003 league title.

After the Clausura 2008 season, San Salvador finished second last in the league and as a result had to take part in a playoff with Segunda División runner-up Juventud Independiente to stay in the First division. San Salvador lost the home and away playoff 4–2 on aggregate and was relegated. Following this San Salvador continued to have problems, although this time it was due to players complaining that they had not been paid. San Salvador could not afford to pay its players, so it decided to sell its spot in the Segunda División, and paid its players with the money that they got. This effectively killed the club, and it has since ceased operations.

<text>William Hughes Mearns (1875–1965), better known as Hughes Mearns, was an American educator and poet. A graduate of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, Mearns was a professor at the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy from 1905 to 1920. Mearns is remembered now as the author of the poem &quot;Antigonish&quot; (or &quot;The Little Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;). However, his ideas about encouraging the natural creativity of children, particularly those age 3 through 8 were novel at the time. It has been written about him that, &quot;He typed notes of their conversations; he learned how to make them forget there was an adult around; never asked them questions and never showed surprise no matter what they did or said.&quot;

==Career==
Mearns wrote two influential books: &quot;Creative Youth&quot; 1925 and &quot;Creative Power&quot; 1929. Essayist Gabriel Gudding credits those books with &quot;[lighting] a fuse&quot; under the teaching of creative writing, influencing a generation of scholars.

He also served for a time (starting in 1920) as head of the Lincoln School Teachers College at Columbia University. He was also a proponent of John Dewey&#x27;s work in progressive education.

==Antigonish==

Mearns is credited with the well-known rhyme, composed in 1899 as a song for a play he had written, called &quot;The Psyco-ed&quot;. The play was performed in 1910, and the poem was first published as &quot;Antigonish&quot; in 1922.
:&quot;Yesterday upon the stair&quot;
:&quot;I met a man who wasn’t there&quot;
:&quot;He wasn’t there again today&quot;
:&quot;I wish, I wish he’d go away&quot;

:&quot;When I came home last night at three&quot;
:&quot;The man was waiting there for me&quot;
:&quot;But when I looked around the hall&quot;
:&quot;I couldn’t see him there at all!&quot;
:&quot;Go away, go away, don’t you come back any more!&quot;
:&quot;Go away, go away, and please don’t slam the door&quot;

:&quot;Last night I saw upon the stair&quot;
:&quot;A little man who wasn’t there&quot;
:&quot;He wasn’t there again today&quot;
:&quot;Oh, how I wish he’d go away&quot;
::&quot;Antigonish&quot; (1899)

Mearns also wrote many parodies of this poem, entitled &quot;Later Antigonishes&quot;, such as &quot;Alibi&quot;:
:As I was falling down the stair
:I met a bump that wasn&#x27;t there;
:It might have put me on the shelf
:Except I wasn&#x27;t there myself.

<doc id="1126534" wikidata="Q976172" url="?curid=1126534" title="Carlton Centre">
<text>The Carlton Centre is a 50-storey skyscraper and shopping centre located on Commissioner Street in central Johannesburg, South Africa. At , it was the tallest building in Africa for 46 years from its completion in 1973 until 2019. It is today the continent&#x27;s fifth tallest building after The Leonardo (also in Johannesburg), the Mohammed VI Tower in Morocco, the Great Mosque of Algiers Tower in Algeria and the Iconic Tower in Egypt. From completion until 1977 it was also the tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere: the only South African building to have held that title. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are in diameter and extend down to the bedrock, below street level. The building houses both offices and shops, and has over 46 per cent of the floor area below ground level.

The Carlton Centre is linked to the Carlton Hotel by a below-ground shopping centre with over 180 shops.

==History==
===Design and construction===
Part of the land required for this project consisted of northern and southern city blocks bordered by Commissioner Street in the north, and Main in the south connected by Smal Street. To the west was Kruis Street connected by Fox Street to Von Wielligh in the east. On the two southern blocks bordered by Fox, Kruis, Main and von Wielligh stood the old Castle Lager brewery. A new brewery was constructed in the southern suburbs, so this site was demolished by South African Breweries and sold to the Schlesinger family who turned the blocks into temporary parking lots. Original Carlton Hotel had been demolished in 1963 by John Schlesinger, son of I.W. Schelesinger, and the company had plans to build a shop and office block.

South African Breweries, under Tom Sceales, decided to build a hotel in the Johannesburg CBD, and after seeking his board&#x27;s permission to reverse the old decision to sell off the land, repurchased the land. At the same time, Anglo American&#x27;s property division was investigating property to purchase in order to create a superblock in the city. The two ideas merged, and Harry Gotlieb of J.H. Isaacs was employed as the two party&#x27;s secret intermediary, who purchased the Schlesinger&#x27;s southern block. He then negotiated the purchase of the northern block between Fox and Commissioner streets from fifteen companies and thirty individuals. One holdout, Barclays Bank, would purchase a 10% stake in the project for its sale of its plot, leaving SA Breweries and Anglo each with a 45% share. Part of a block in Main Street across from the Southern section was purchased. The project was announced on 24 November 1963.

US architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed the Carlton Centre in conjunction with a local firm W. Rhodes-Harrison, Hoffe and Partners. The concept plan was for a fifty storey office building, 600 room luxury hotel, and a department store at ground level. The latter three buildings would sit on plaza with an open air circular court leading two underground shopping levels. The plan included 2,000 parking spaces below the plaza including one level for deliveries for the retail shops and restaurants. A building, across from the plaza on Main Street, consisted of a ground floor with shops and department store, and two subfloors consisting of shops connected to plaza&#x27;s underground shopping level. The upper floors, above the shops and department store, consisted of six levels for parking with the last level consisting of a conference exhibition floor. The buildings would be constructed of poured in place concrete with a sandblasted grey granite finish with floor space of 3,500,000 square feet. The design of the office tower is very similar to that of One Seneca Tower in Buffalo, New York, completed in 1973.

Anglo American Properties began construction in the late 1960s by the closing roads to form a city superblock. Excavation of the superblocks basement began in 1966 by LTA, excavating 1 million tons of earth to a depth of 30m and boreholes drilled to keep out the water table. The excavations and basement shell were completed in 1968. Murry &amp; Roberts won the tender to build the site and started work in 1968.

The original department store on the north-western edge of the superblock opened on 14 July 1971 with Garlicks as the tenant. The other original department store was OK Bazaars. Offices shops and shops opened between 1971 and 1972. Carlton Panorama, as it was called at the time, and on the top floor of the office block, was handed over from contractors in August 1973.

In 1972, SA Breweries sold its share to Anglo America because it was concerned about the financial viability of the project. The Carlton Centre was officially opened on 1 September 1973 at a total cost of over R88 million. The hotel itself had cost R23 million. Western International Hotels was appointed to run the new Carlton Hotel.

The Kine Centre, consisting of a cinema, office block and retail shops, was built by the Schlesinger&#x27;s opposite the northern part of the super block on Commissioner Street and connected it to the Carlton Centre by underground pedestrian tunnel accessed from pavement at street level.

===Use===
The building is the head office of transport parastatal Transnet, who purchased it in 1999 from Anglo American Properties (Amaprop). In June 2007, then Transnet group chief executive Maria Ramos revealed the company&#x27;s intention to offer the building for sale. The Carlton Centre had served as Transnet&#x27;s headquarters since 2000; it had also been the headquarters of AECI in the 1980s and 1990s before the city&#x27;s urban decay began, after the parastatal purchased it for R33 million from Anglo American Properties. The disposal of the property forms part of Transnet&#x27;s restructuring programme, which includes the disposal of non-core assets. Due to the Great Recession, the parastatal announced it would not seek a buyer until markets recovered.

Although Transnet has given no indication of the price, the replacement cost of the building has been estimated at R1.5 billion.

The centre, after being almost empty, now has 93 percent occupancy of its office space and retail occupancy of 65 percent. Pick n Pay plans to take 3,000 square metres in the centre and the South African Revenue Service has moved from Rissik Street to its premises of 5,000 square metres in the centre. While there have been proposals to reinstate the Carlton Hotel at some stage, no official announcements to this end have been made.

==Other information==
The 50th and topmost floor of the Carlton Centre was called the Carlton Panorama and is known colloquially as the &quot;Top of Africa&quot;. Once the tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere, the Carlton Centre opened with the 5-star and 30-storey Carlton Hotel taking up most of the floor space of the complex. The hotel was popular among the rich and famous, hosting many famous guests over the years. Urban decay in the inner city during the 1990s affected the hotel, which ceased operations in 1998 after nearly 25 years of operation.

<text>Thomas James Feely (born May 23, 1976) is an American sportscaster and former professional football player. He started his playing career as a placekicker with the Florida Bobcats in the Arena Football League (AFL) as a free agent in 1999 before playing for several National Football League (NFL) teams. Since his retirement, Feely has worked as a reporter and analyst for CBS/Turner Sports.

Feely played college football for the Michigan Wolverines. He was also a member of the AFL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Storm and in the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons, New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs, New York Jets, Arizona Cardinals, and Chicago Bears. He was a member of the &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; All-Rookie Team with the Falcons in 2001.

==Early years==
Feely attended Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida. While there, he set Hillsborough County career and season records for field goals and extra points. Feely played for the Temple Terrace Spirit Soccer team that won the National Championships when he was 16 years old.

==College career==
Feely was a four-year letterman at the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1998. As a senior in 1998, he converted 17 of 22 field goal attempts and 40 of 41 point-after attempts on his way to a mention for the All-Big Ten team. His longest career field goal was 51-yard kick against Baylor as a junior. He finished his career 20-for-26 in field goals and 43-for-44 in extra points.

==Professional career==

===Florida Bobcats===
After going undrafted in the 1999 NFL draft, Feely kicked for the Florida Bobcats of the Arena Football League. That season, he went 2-for-5 in field goal attempts and 8-for-13 in extra point attempts. He added three tackles (two solo) and forced a fumble.

===Tampa Bay Storm===
Feely kicked for the Tampa Bay Storm in 2000, converting one of six field goal attempts and three of four extra point attempts. He returned one kickoff for 22 yards.

===Atlanta Falcons===
In March 2001, Feely worked out for the Washington Redskins but was not signed. On April 12, he signed a one-year, $209,000 contract with the Atlanta Falcons. Although Jake Arians had been expected to be the Falcons&#x27; placekicker during the 2001 season, Feely won the job.

As a rookie with the Falcons in 2001, Feely converted 29 of 37 field goal attempts (78.4%) and all 28 extra point attempts. He also converted 14 of 15 field goals away from the Georgia Dome. His 115 points tied him with the Eagles&#x27; David Akers for second in the NFC, behind only Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins. Feely converted a 55-yard attempt against the Arizona Cardinals on September 30. He also caught one pass for -2 yards from Falcons punter Chris Mohr on a fake field goal attempt. For his performance during the season, Feely was a consensus all-rookie selection.

An exclusive-rights free agent in the 2002 offseason, Feely was tendered a one-year, $300,000 contract by the Falcons on February 22. He signed the deal on June 7. That season, he converted 32 of 40 field goal attempts (80 percent) and all but one of 43 extra point attempts. His 32 field goals tied him with Tampa Bay Buccaneers kicker Martín Gramática for most in the NFL. It also broke Morten Andersen&#x27;s previous franchise record of 31 set in 1995. Feely earned NFL Special Teams Player of the Week honors after converting three field goals of more than 40 yards against the Carolina Panthers on October 20, and eventually earned NFC Special Teams Player of the Month honors for converting 9 of 10 field goals and all nine points after touchdowns. In 2003, Feely converted 19 of 27 field goal attempts (70.4 percent) and 32 of 33 extra point attempts.

On March 6, 2004, the Falcons re-signed Feely – a restricted free agent – to a one-year contract worth $628,000. That season, he achieved a field goal percentage of 78.3 by converting 18 of 23 tries. He connected on all 40 of his extra point attempts that season. On September 19 against the St. Louis Rams, he recovered his own onside kick. In two playoff games, Feely was a perfect 2-for-2 in field goals and 7-for-7 on PATs.

===New York Giants===
An unrestricted free agent in the 2005 offseason, Feely signed a three-year deal with the New York Giants on March 12. The contract included base salaries of $540,000 (2005), $545,000 (2006) and $550,000 (2007). In a preseason game against the New York Jets that year, Feely scored all his team&#x27;s points in a 15–14 victory by connecting on five field goals, including two over 50 yards. In week 12 in 2005 at the Seahawks however, Feely failed to connect on 3 consecutive potential game-winning field goals, and the Giants lost 24–21 despite compiling 490 yards total offense. The Giants ended up in a wild-card playoff game where they lost to Carolina. Feely broke the New York Giants franchise record for best field goal percentage over a two-year period. He had an 83% followed by an 85% year while with the Giants.

===Miami Dolphins===
As a free agent in the 2007 offseason, the Miami Dolphins signed Feely to a three-year contract worth just under $5 million on March 8. The team subsequently traded placekicker Olindo Mare to the New Orleans Saints on April 3.

During his first season with the Dolphins, experienced the most productive season of his career and in franchise history. He missed just two of his 23 field goal attempts, setting a new franchise record for field goal percentage at 91.3. The record had previously been 90.5 percent by Mare in 2001. Through the 2007 season, Feely had converted 164 straight extra point attempts and had created five recovered onside kicks.

During the 2008 offseason, it was reported that new Dolphins Vice President Bill Parcells did not like Feely&#x27;s outspoken nature and that he would not be assured a roster spot despite his 2007 success. The Dolphins released fellow kicker Dave Rayner on June 6, leaving only undrafted rookie Dan Carpenter (Montana) to challenge Feely for the team&#x27;s placekicking job in 2008. He was released by the Dolphins on August 12, 2008.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
On August 25, 2008, Feely was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs, and released one day later.

===New York Jets===
After New York Jets kicker Mike Nugent was injured in the team&#x27;s Week 1 contest against the Miami Dolphins, they signed Feely on September 8, 2008. On November 13, Feely kicked a game-winning 34-yard field goal in overtime against the New England Patriots; the Jets took sole possession of first place in the AFC East for the first time since November 19, 2001.

Through 10 games, Feely had made 16 of his 20 field goal attempts (80.0%), with an average of 35.1 yards and a long of 55 yards and converted all 23 PATs for a total of 71 points. Feely reportedly began working out his upper body five days a week in the Jets new training facility, saying, &quot;I work out hard in the weight room just so I don&#x27;t get injured.&quot; His workout primarily centered on deadlifts.
On March 4, 2009, Feely re-signed a one-year contract with the Jets.

In Week Six of the 2009 season against the Buffalo Bills, Feely broke Pat Leahy&#x27;s record of 23 consecutive field goals, hitting his 24th. However, he missed his next attempt in the second-quarter, leaving the team record at 24.

On December 21, 2009, Feely went 0–2 in field goal attempts. He &quot;shanked&quot; a 38-yard try and had a 37-yarder blocked, as the Jets lost to the Atlanta Falcons 10–7. On January 9, 2010, Feely recorded his first career punt in a playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals, when he was unexpectedly pressed into service after his teammate Steve Weatherford was sidelined with an irregular heartbeat.

===Arizona Cardinals===
Feely signed with the Arizona Cardinals on April 2, 2010.
On December 12, 2010, Feely became just the fourth kicker in 40 years to run for a touchdown, scoring on a fake field goal against the Denver Broncos. Feely also kicked a career-high five field goals in the game.
Feely scored 25 points in that game, the most points scored by a player in a single game since October 21, 2007, when Rob Bironas scored 26 against the Houston Texans. On Christmas Day in 2010, Feely kicked a 48-yard field goal for a win over the Dallas Cowboys. On October 14, 2012, in a Week 6 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, Feely hit a 61-yard field goal, setting a new career best. However, in the same game, his 38-yard field goal attempt was deflected with 3 seconds left in the fourth quarter, which the Cardinals went on to lose 16–19 in OT. Feely re-signed with the Cardinals for the 2014 season. The Cardinals released Feely on August 25, 2014.

===Chicago Bears===
The Chicago Bears signed Feely on December 3, 2014, as injury cover for Robbie Gould when he was considered doubtful for the game against the Dallas Cowboys. Feely played the remaining four games of the season for the Chicago Bears, three of which were at Soldier Field.

==Career regular season statistics==

==In the media==

Feely appeared on &quot;ESPN First Take&quot;, and also with his wife Rebecca, on &quot;A Baby Story&quot; on TLC, which aired January 11, 2006.

After missing three field goals for the Giants in an overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks in 2005, Feely was the subject of a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch. The NFL Films parody, entitled &quot;The Long Ride Home: The Jay Feely Story&quot;, featured comedian Dane Cook as Feely on the Giants&#x27; five-hour flight home from Seattle, where he is forced to land the plane through two large radio towers that look like field goal posts.

Feely joined the CBS Sports Network in 2015 as a color analyst covering college football. Beginning in 2017, Feely also served as a color commentator for CBS&#x27; NFL telecasts, working alongside Beth Mowins, the first full-time female NFL play-by-play announcer. In 2018, he was set to be color analyst with play-by-play partner Mowins on the #8 team of NFL on CBS for Weeks 13 and 17, but he settled for sideline reporter for Weeks 10 and 17 as the #5 announcing team. He also joined neurosurgeon, CNN medical reporter and fellow Michigan alum Sanjay Gupta as a commentator on the Wolverines&#x27; TeamCast for the school&#x27;s appearance in the 2018 NCAA Men&#x27;s Final Four, airing on TNT. When he is not working as analyst, he is the reporter for the #4 team for the NFL on CBS. In 2021, Feely teamed up with Dedes and started on the #7 team of NFL on CBS for Week 1 while James Lofton was away; Andrew Catalon and Tiki Barber teamed up as the #6 announcing team, and Tom McCarthy and Aaron Taylor teamed up as the #5 announcing team. He and Dedes served the #6 team of NFL on CBS for the rest of the 2021 and 2022 seasons. In 2023, Feely teamed up with Tom McCarthy and Lofton to stay at the #6 team.

==Personal life==
A number of Feely&#x27;s family members have also been involved in sports. His grandfather, Thomas J. Feely was a college basketball and baseball coach for St. Thomas College in St. Paul, Minnesota from the early 1950s to 1984. He was inducted into the N.A.I.A. National Basketball Hall of Fame both as a coach and as a player.

Feely&#x27;s father, Thomas J. &quot;T.J.&quot; Feely, is a former College of St. Thomas running back and also a tennis coach who owns the Feely Kicking School of Tampa, Florida. Feely enjoys golf and has played with the Mater Dei golf team on multiple occasions.

Feely and his wife, Rebecca, live in Arizona. The couple have four children, one of whom, Jace, is the kicker for the University of Colorado. Feely is also close friends with former college teammates Tom Brady and Desmond Howard.

Feely has appeared on Fox News&#x27; &quot;Hannity&quot; talking about his disagreements with President Barack Obama&#x27;s policies and whether he is running for president.

In 2011, Feely became a member of School of the Legends, and contributes to the organization with instructional videos, which focus on his position as a kicker.

Feely is a supporter of President Donald Trump, and called it an honor to play golf with him on August 15, 2020.

<text>In mathematics, engineering, computer science and economics, an optimization problem is the problem of finding the &quot;best&quot; solution from all feasible solutions.

Optimization problems can be divided into two categories, depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete: 
* An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a &quot;discrete optimization&quot;, in which an object such as an integer, permutation or graph must be found from a countable set. 
* A problem with continuous variables is known as a &quot;continuous optimization&quot;, in which an optimal value from a continuous function must be found. They can include constrained problems and multimodal problems.

==Continuous optimization problem==

The &quot;standard form&quot; of a continuous optimization problem is
formula_1
where
* is the &quot;objective function&quot; to be minimized over the -variable vector ,
* are called &quot;inequality constraints&quot;
* are called &quot;equality constraints&quot;, and
* and .

If , the problem is an unconstrained optimization problem. By convention, the standard form defines a minimization problem. A maximization problem can be treated by negating the objective function.

==Combinatorial optimization problem==
Formally, a combinatorial optimization problem is a quadruple , where
* is a set of instances;
* given an instance , is the set of feasible solutions;
* given an instance and a feasible solution of , denotes the measure of , which is usually a positive real.
* is the goal function, and is either or .

The goal is then to find for some instance an &quot;optimal solution&quot;, that is, a feasible solution with
formula_2

For each combinatorial optimization problem, there is a corresponding decision problem that asks whether there is a feasible solution for some particular measure . For example, if there is a graph which contains vertices and , an optimization problem might be &quot;find a path from to that uses the fewest edges&quot;. This problem might have an answer of, say, 4. A corresponding decision problem would be &quot;is there a path from to that uses 10 or fewer edges?&quot; This problem can be answered with a simple &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;.

In the field of approximation algorithms, algorithms are designed to find near-optimal solutions to hard problems. The usual decision version is then an inadequate definition of the problem since it only specifies acceptable solutions. Even though we could introduce suitable decision problems, the problem is more naturally characterized as an optimization problem.

<doc id="1126540" wikidata="Q574530" url="?curid=1126540" title="Kumara, New Zealand">
<text>Kumara is a town on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located south of Greymouth, close to the western end of , which leads across Arthur&#x27;s Pass to Christchurch. The Taramakau River flows past to the north.

The population was 285 in the 2018 census, a decrease of 24 (7.76%) from 2013.

The name may come from the Māori language Kohe mara, which is the blossom of the tātarāmoa, or bush lawyer.

The Coast to Coast annual multisport race starts at Kumara Beach.

==History==
Kumara was founded and became one of the country&#x27;s chief gold mining centres following the discovery of gold at Dillmanstown, about to the south-east, in 1876. The tramline from Greymouth to Paroa was extended to Kumara the following year. The population was 4,220 in October 1877. The town became a borough in 1877. Kumara Hospital was operating by 1881 and continued into the twentieth century. In 1882, the Kumara volunteer fire brigade was formed.

Kumara was the home town of prominent politician Richard Seddon, who was elected mayor of the town in 1877, and served as Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906.

In 1925, the manager of Pearns Hotel in Kumara was charged by police after she refused to supply accommodation to two visiting temperance lecturers. The Pearn&#x27;s Brewery became part of Westland Ales around this time.

Although the town once had 50 pubs, the numbers dwindled. In June 2009, the last remaining pub, the Empire Hotel, had its licence cancelled by the Liquor Licensing Authority. In 2010, the last store of the town faced closure, with only a few hundred inhabitants left, but it was hoped that one of the New Zealand Cycle Trails to run through the town would lift the settlement&#x27;s fortunes again. In November 2012 the Theatre Royal Hotel reopened as the only pub serving Kumara, and in November 2013 the West Coast Wilderness Trail cycleway running from Greymouth to Ross was officially opened with a ceremony in Kumara.

==Demographics==

== Former swimming pool ==

In 1934, a community swimming pool was constructed using voluntary labour. The pool was built during the 1930s depression when mining activity and the population of the area had both declined. It was long and wide, with a depth of at the deep end. The pool was built in the unique surroundings of debris left behind from old gold diggings, with the walls made from boulders from the diggings. Water for the pool was conveyed from the Dillmanstown Kapitea Reservoir using old iron pipes recovered from historic sluicing schemes. The pool was originally part of a sports complex for the township including a basketball court and a cricket pitch. The pool is no longer in use but the area has been registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category 2 listed place.

<text>Mortal Engines is a young adult science fiction novel by Philip Reeve, published by Scholastic UK in 2001. The book focuses on a futuristic, steampunk version of London, now a giant machine striving to survive on a world that is running out of resources.

&quot;Mortal Engines&quot; is the first book of a series, the &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot;, published from 2001 to 2006. It has been adapted as a 2018 feature film.

The book won a Nestlé Smarties Book Prize and the 2003 Blue Peter Book Award. It was shortlisted for the 2002 Whitbread Award, the 2004 ALA&#x27;s Notable Books for Children award and the 2020 Blue Peter Awards 20th anniversary prize.

==Summary==
===Setting===
The book is set in a post-apocalyptic world, ravaged by the &quot;Sixty Minute War&quot;, a global conflict so violent it caused massive geological upheaval. To escape earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other natural threats, a Nomad leader called Nikola Quercus (known throughout the Quartet as Nicholas Quirke, and revered as a deity) installed massive engines and wheels on London, enabling it to dismantle (or eat) other cities for resources. The technology rapidly spread and evolved into what is known as &quot;Municipal Darwinism&quot;. Although the planet has since become stable, Municipal Darwinism has spread worldwide. Because scientific progress has almost completely halted and much technological and scientific knowledge was lost during the war, &quot;Old Tech&quot; is highly prized and recovered by scavengers and archaeologists. Europe, some of Asia, North Africa, South America, Australia, and the Arctic are dominated by Traction Cities. In contrast, North America - often identified as &quot;the dead continent&quot; due to the extensive destruction it suffered during the war - and the rest of the world is the stronghold of the Anti-Traction League, which seeks to keep cities from moving and thus stop the intense consumption of the planet&#x27;s remaining resources.

London is the principal Traction City in the novel, which has returned to a Victorian-era society. London&#x27;s society is divided into four major and several minor Guilds. The Engineers are responsible for maintaining the machines necessary for the survival of London, many of which are found by the Guild of Historians. The Historians are in charge of collecting and preserving highly prized, often dangerous artifacts. The Navigators are responsible for steering and plotting the course of London. The Merchants are in charge of running London&#x27;s economy. London is officially ruled by an elected Mayor. The Lord Mayor is Magnus Crome, who is also the head of the Guild of Engineers. Like most Traction Cities, London is built on a series of tiers. This encourages the system of social classes, with the wealthier nobles at the top of the city and the lower classes further down, closer to the noise and pollution of the city&#x27;s massive engines. Atop the whole of London sits St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral: the only building known to have survived the Sixty Minute War.

==Plot==
The book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent, as punishment for skipping a chore, to the &quot;Gut&quot; of London, where captured Traction cities or towns are stripped of resources. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook&#x27;s residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground and, after an argument, they start following the city&#x27;s tracks to reboard it.

The pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a cyborg &quot;Stalker&quot; called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him.

Tom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London.

Hester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down, and saving her life.

Valentine is sent away by Crome on a &quot;secret mission&quot;, much to Katherine&#x27;s dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London and that the Guild of Engineers had reassembled it inside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The Cathedral&#x27;s dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London.

Tom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League&#x27;s northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the &quot;13th Floor Elevator&quot;. Tom and Hester take the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves.

With MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League&#x27;s base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester&#x27;s mother, Pandora and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester&#x27;s half-sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA but are caught in their attempt.

The Guild of Historians, led by Tom&#x27;s boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the &quot;13th Floor Elevator&quot; above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father&#x27;s way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him.

Hester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;, apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads.

==Characters==
A few of the people in &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; are named after places in Devon, where Reeve lives, including Chudleigh, Tamerton Foliot and the River Plym. In the quartet, Miss Plym and Chudleigh Pomeroy are both in the Guild of Historians, and Tamarton Foliot is an &quot;Alternative&quot; historian. Both Shrike and Smew are named after birds, and Pennyroyal is named after a flower.

*Hester Shaw, a 15-year-old short-tempered assassin whose parents were murdered by Valentine and seeks vengeance.
*Anna Fang, a friendly but deadly aviatrix and Anti-Tractionist agent who rescues Hester and Tom from being sold into slavery.
*Thaddeus Valentine, the dashing and handsome famous archaeologist and Head of the Guild of Historians on London, formerly a scavenger, and father to Katherine.
*Katherine Valentine, Thaddeus Valentine&#x27;s daughter who begins to become suspicious about her father&#x27;s activities.

==Title==
The title references Act III, Scene iii of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot; (&quot;Othello: And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throats / Th&#x27;immortal Jove&#x27;s dread clamors, counterfet, / Farewell: Othello&#x27;s Occupation&#x27;s gone&quot; – line 352). In the novel, it refers to the fact that the society of Municipal Darwinism is not sustainable living and that the cities&#x27; engines are indeed mortal.

==Development==
Philip Reeve has stated that his plans to write a science fiction novel were laid in the late 1980s.

The original drafts were intended to be an adult novel but after several rejections, Scholastic said they might be interested in &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; as a children&#x27;s story. In the refactoring the story was simplified, removing several characters and much content such as the city politics that Reeve thought would not be interesting to children.

The Mortal Engines world was originally written as an alternative universe set in the early 1900s, but Reeve has stated this turned out to require just too much explaining as how and where history could have diverged. He was inspired to start then due to &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

==Critical reception==
At Goodreads, &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; has a score of 3.92 out of 5.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the book, calling it &quot;staggering feat of engineering ... [that] ... offers new wonders at every turn&quot;.

==Adaptation==

A film adaptation by Peter Jackson was announced in 2009. In October 2016, Jackson announced that the film would be his next project as producer and co-writer, alongside long-time collaborators Fran Walsh (also his wife) and Philippa Boyens. The film was directed by Jackson&#x27;s long-time collaborator Christian Rivers.

On 18 November 2020, upon asked whether &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; would be rebooted for television, Reeve responded that, while that would be nice, it seemed unlikely.

==Legacy==
Critics have suggested that the 2019 Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Carnival Row&quot; is influenced by the &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; series of novels, amongst other influences.

<text>Club Social y Deportivo Xelajú Mario Camposeco, commonly known as Xelajú MC or just Xela and nicknamed Superchivos is a Guatemalan professional football club competing in the Liga Nacional, the top tier of Guatemalan football. They are located in Quetzaltenango, Department of Quetzaltenango, and play their home matches in the &quot;Estadio Mario Camposeco&quot;. They are the most successful team (in terms of national titles won) not based in the capital city in the history of the league.

==History==
The club was founded in 1928 as Germania; after ten years of existence, their name would be changed to ADIX &quot;(Asociación Deportiva Independiente de Xelajú)&quot;, and during that time the uniform colors were established as red jersey and blue shorts, a combination that remains to date. The team was renamed Xelajú Mario Camposeco in honor of local footballer Mario Camposeco who was the captain of the club in the 1940s, helped them win 10 consecutive Quetzaltenango department titles, and who was still an active player when he died in a plane crash in 1951.

The &quot;Superchivos&quot; have been Guatemalan champions seven times, in 1961–62, 1980, 1995–96, 2006–07, 2011–12, 2022-23, and 2024. Xelajú has won the Copa Centenario once, in 1972–73. In the 2007 Clausura tournament, they eliminated five-time defending champion Municipal in semi-finals, to reach their first final since the inception of the &quot;Apertura&quot;/&quot;Clausura&quot; format.

<text>Novagen Software Ltd (commonly referred to as Novagen) was a British software developer which released a number of computer games on a variety of platforms from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s.

The company was set up by Paul Woakes and Bruce Jordan and employed approximately 18 people. In addition to running Novagen, Paul Woakes also developed and programmed the vast majority of the company&#x27;s products and the first version of a custom loading scheme that worked ten times faster than Commodore&#x27;s own, which became Novaload.

<text>The term Greater Johannesburg may refer to:
* The area governed by the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council (GJMC) from 1995 to 2000.
* The current City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, which superseded the GJMC in 2000 with the incorporation of much of Midrand and some of Modderfontein.
* The place itemised in the 1996 census, defined as the MLC&#x27;s constituting the GJMC (i.e. Northern, Eastern, Western and Southern Johannesburg MLC&#x27;s) plus Kempton Park/Tembisa MLC, Edenvale/Modderfontein MLC and Midrand/Rabie Ridge/Ivory Park. the name &quot;Greater Johannesburg&quot; has not been used in any subsequent census.
* The Johannesburg conurbation which includes Johannesburg and the areas of the East Rand, area under the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality and the West Rand. It is often referred to as the &quot;Witwatersrand&quot;, or &quot;Rand&quot;, after a low mountain range that runs through the area. Greater Johannesburg&#x27;s growth was largely based initially on the discovery of gold, and the urban area runs the length of the gold-bearing reef from east to west. The case for including the East and West Rand in Johannesburg, as well as Soweto, is based on a number of factors:
** The area shares the same dialling code, 011 and 010
** The East Rand and Soweto campuses of the former Vista University are incorporated into the University of Johannesburg.
** OR Tambo International Airport, which serves Johannesburg, is located in the East Rand.
** Roodepoort, always traditionally part of the West Rand, was incorporated into the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in 2000, while Soweto, always regarded as Johannesburg&#x27;s sister city or major township during Apartheid, was administered as part of the West Rand in the past.
** Residents from both the East and the West Rand often work in Johannesburg.
** The areas are not only strongly linked economically, but existing transport axes have also created strong functional links between Johannesburg and its hinterland.
** Eastgate Shopping Centre, Johannesburg, the second-largest in the metro area, straddles the border between Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni.
** Vehicles of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) are identical in design, but JMPDs are orange and EMPDs are yellow. The JMPD and EMPD sometimes carry out joint operations.
** Transport routes between Johannesburg, East and West Rand share the same metropolitan route numbering system.

<doc id="1126571" wikidata="Q32389" url="?curid=1126571" title="Zoroastrian Dari language">
<text>Zoroastrian Dari ( literally Behdīnān dialect) is a Persian dialect and a Northwestern Iranian ethnolect.

Zoroastrian Dari used to be spoken by almost a million people in central Iran, up until the 1880s. Nowadays, it is used as a first language by an estimated 8,000 to 15,000 Zoroastrians in and around the cities of Yazd and Kerman in central Iran, and by the Irani community in India.

Dari is also known as Behdināni or pejoratively as Gabri (sometimes Gavrŭni or Gabrōni). Dari has numerous dialects.

==Genealogy==
Genealogically, Dari Persian is a member of the Northwestern Iranian language subfamily, which includes several other closely related languages, for instance, Kurdish, Zazaki, and Balochi. These Northwestern Iranian languages are a branch of the larger Western Iranian language group, which is, in turn, a subgroup of the Iranian language family.

==Name==
The language known as Zoroastrian Dari is also referred to as &#x27;Behdinâni&#x27; (&quot;language of the people of good religion&quot;) or pejorative name, &#x27;Gabri&#x27; (&quot;language of the infidels&quot;). The roots of the name &#x27;Gabri&#x27; date back to the Muslim invasion of Iran and are resented by speakers of Dari to refer to their ethnolect. 

==Dialects==

According to Farudi and Toosarvaredani, Dari is traditionally divided into two main dialects: the variety spoken in Yazd and the one spoken in Kerman. However, this division of the ethnolect conceals the complexity of the actual dialectical situation. The Yazdi dialect has approximately thirty varieties, each distinct and unique to one of the Zoroastrian neighborhoods in and around Yazd. Were it not for the geographic proximity of the Yazdi dialects, they would be classified as distinct dialects. The Kermani dialect may also contain (or may have contained at one time) a comparable level of dialectical complexity.

==Endangered status==

The pressures affecting the vitality of Dari Persian today are largely economic. In order to obtain an economic advantage, speakers are giving up their ethnolect for the dominant dialect of Iran, standard Persian. Parents intentionally do not transmit Dari to their children in order that they may have what is felt to be an advantage in school and in life. The ethnolect loss can also occur more indirectly and less visible when people move to larger urban centers or abroad in pursuit of better economic opportunities; the lack of a complete ethnolect environment in which to immerse a child decreases or completely inhibits the transmission of the ethnolect to new generations.

In past times, Dari speakers experienced political pressures to yield up their ethnolect as well. The period since the seventh-century Muslim conquest of Persia has been a time of great persecution for the Zoroastrians of Iran. Political pressures have directly resulted in ethnolect loss when Zoroastrians have deliberately abandoned their ethnolect as a means of hiding their religion so as to escape persecution. Political pressures have also led to language loss indirectly; the oppression the Zoroastrians have been experienced under Iran&#x27;s rulers has driven a steady stream of Zoroastrians to more tolerant areas, mostly the capital, Tehran. Again, an environment where the ethnolect is spoken does not exist in these places, inhibiting the transmission of Dari to new generations.

Linguists currently consider Dari to be in a state of language shift. Many of the language&#x27;s speakers have assimilated to the dominant dialect and have given up—intentionally or unintentionally—their traditional ethnolect. Ethnolects like Dari are transferring from a state of maintenance, in which an etholect is being sustained in the face of pressure from a dominant dialect, to extinction, a state in which the ethnolect is no longer spoken.

Many of Dari&#x27;s dialects are facing extinction at an even more rapid pace than the language as a whole. Since each of Dari&#x27;s many dialects has a smaller community of speakers, they are more susceptible to the forces driving the language towards extinction. Some dialects have already effectively reached extinction, for example, the Mohammadabad dialect, which, it is reported, possesses only a few speakers living in Tehran. The Kerman dialect, always susceptible because of the smaller size of its Zoroastrian population, also seems to be largely lost.

<text>What a Girl Wants is a 2003 American teen comedy film directed by Dennie Gordon and written by Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler. Based on the 1955 play &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; by William Douglas-Home, it is the second adaptation for the screen of this work and stars Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, Eileen Atkins, Anna Chancellor, and Jonathan Pryce. The film tells the story of a seventeen-year-old girl who goes to the United Kingdom to meet the father she never knew.

The film was released on April 4, 2003, received mixed reviews and grossed $51 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old Daphne Reynolds is an American girl, living with her wedding singer mother, Libby, above a restaurant in Chinatown, Manhattan. Many years earlier, Libby had met Briton Henry Dashwood in Morocco, and they had gotten married in a Bedouin wedding ceremony, under uncertain legality. They then returned to his family&#x27;s estate in England. His father died soon afterward, making Henry the new Lord Dashwood, Earl of Wycombe. Alistair Payne, the family&#x27;s aristocratic advisor, tricked Libby into leaving Henry without telling him of her pregnancy, then lied to Henry and claimed Libby had fallen in love with someone else.

Libby has always been honest with Daphne about who her father was, though Daphne felt a sense of emptiness without him. Daphne soon graduates from high school and she runs off to London to try and meet her father. Henry has disclaimed his seat in the House of Lords to run for election to the House of Commons, hoping to eventually become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Henry is being pushed by Alistair, acting as his political advisor. As a result, Henry has become engaged to Alistair&#x27;s snobbish daughter, Glynnis, who only wants to marry Henry in order to become the new Countess of Wycombe, who also had an equally snobbish and bratty teenage daughter, Clarissa.

Checking into a London hostel, Daphne meets Ian Wallace, a local boy who works there to support his dream of becoming a musician. After forming a friendship when Ian shows Daphne around London, they start dating. When Henry catches Daphne at his estate, he is stunned to learn he has a daughter, but his mother, Jocelyne, the current Countess of Wycombe, immediately welcomes her in, giving her a room at the estate. After confirming things in a phone call with Libby, Henry embraces the opportunity to connect with her. Daphne tries to win the acceptance of her father&#x27;s social circle, but is repeatedly thwarted by Glynnis and Clarissa, who feel threatened by her arrival. In addition, Daphne has to ward off the advances of a boy, Armistead Stewart, a sleazy and arrogant upper-class boy whom Clarissa fancies and with whom Ian has long-standing rivalry. Daphne eventually pushes Armistead into the River Thames.

Daphne inadvertently wins over the British aristocracy, including an elderly royal, Princess Charlotte, whenever she interacts with them. However, Henry&#x27;s political campaign suffers due to Daphne&#x27;s flamboyant behavior, and his subsequent misbehavior with her. He asks her to assume the more dignified manner of the Dashwood lineage, after which Henry&#x27;s polling numbers quickly begin to improve. But Ian is disappointed in her new behavior, made worse when she attends the Queen&#x27;s garden party instead of hanging out with him.

During her Debutante party, hosted by her father, whose mother Jocelyne flies Libby over to attend, Daphne overhears Alistair telling Glynnis how he &quot;got rid&quot; of her mother. When Daphne confronts him, Glynnis locks her in another room. Glynnis then asks Ian, the band&#x27;s lead singer, to announce the father–daughter dance, knowing Henry will have to dance with Clarissa. Libby frees Daphne, but when they see Henry dancing with Clarissa, Daphne rejects her new self, telling Henry she is returning to the United States. Sometime later, Henry surprises everyone by announcing that he is withdrawing from the election. As he leaves the press conference, Henry discovers that Alistair knew about Libby&#x27;s pregnancy and manipulated their separation; he punches Alistair in the face for this deceit, then breaks off his engagement to Glynnis.

Daphne is serving as a caterer at a wedding, where Libby is the singer. When the father–daughter dance begins, Henry shows up, telling Daphne that he loves her for who she is. Daphne embraces him, calling him &quot;Dad&quot; for the first time. Daphne finally gets the father–daughter dance she has been longing for her whole life. Henry informs Daphne that he has brought a large apology present for her—at which point Ian appears and asks her to dance. As Ian and Daphne dance, Henry apologizes to Libby, and the two also start dancing.

In the epilogue, Glynnis has married a wealthy nobleman, who is incredibly boring, Clarissa has married Armistead, who still womanizes, and Alistair now works on a London tour bus. Now able to be together, Henry and Libby are legally married in another Bedouin ceremony, while Daphne is accepted into the University of Oxford, still being in a happy relationship with Ian. The film ends with Daphne, Henry, Libby, Ian, and Jocelyn having a family picnic in the backyard.

==Release==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 36% based on 109 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Little girls will definitely enjoy it, but it&#x27;s too syrupy and predictable for adults.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

The film is available on various streaming services.

Edward Guthmann of The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it a &quot;dreadful teen comedy.&quot; Anya Kamenetz of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the film as &quot;a sanitized adventure for the Mary Kate-and-Ashley set.&quot;

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $11.4 million in 2,964 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #2 at the box office behind fellow newcomer &quot;Phone Booth&quot; ($15 million). By the end of its run, the film had grossed $36.1 million domestically and $14.6 million internationally, totaling $51 million worldwide.

===Promotion===
Before the U.S. release of the film, print advertisements were altered to remove the peace sign that Bynes was giving in the poster as the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, and their allied forces had begun. A rep for Warner Bros. explained: &quot;&#x27;In a time of war, we made a slight alteration so that we could avoid any potential political statement in a completely nonpolitical film.&quot;

<text>George Brough ( ) (21 April 1890 – 12 January 1970), was a motorcycle racer, world record holding motorcycle and automobile manufacturer and showman. He was known for his powerful and expensive Brough Superior motorcycles which were the first superbikes. George died in 1970 but his legacy lives on in the many Brough Superior motorcycles maintained by enthusiasts to this day.

==Early life==
George was the second son of motorcycle pioneer William Edward Brough and was born at 10 Mandalay Street, Basford, Nottingham on 21 April 1890. William Brough had been building motorcycles at his factory in Nottingham since the 1890s so it was expected that George and his brother would join in the family business.

==Business==

George wanted to develop his father&#x27;s business and make high-performance motorcycles. His father was not convinced, however, so George set up his own factory nearby in 1919 at Haydn Road in Nottingham to produce what he called the Brough Superior range of motorcycles and motor cars. The name &quot;Superior&quot; was suggested by a friend, but his father reputedly took it personally. George&#x27;s motorcycles lived up to the claim, however, and he brought together the best components he could find and added distinctive styling details. He had a flair for marketing and in 1922 rode a Brough Superior SS80 which he called &quot;Spit and Polish&quot; at Brooklands. managing an unofficial lap.

3,048 motorcycles of 19 models were made in 21 years of production. Most were custom built to customers&#x27; requirements and rarely were any two of the same configurations. Each motorcycle was assembled twice. The first assembly was for fitting of all components, then the motorcycle was disassembled, and all parts were painted or plated as needed, then the finished parts were assembled finally. Every motorcycle was test ridden to ensure that it performed to specification and was certified by George Brough. The SS100 model was ridden at 100 mph or more prior to delivery. The SS80 model was ridden at or more before delivery. If any motorcycle did not meet specification, it returned to the shop for rework until it performed properly.

In 1929 an SS100 was purchased by Sir William Lyons who two years later applied the same name to his own first four-wheeled vehicle, much to Brough&#x27;s disgruntlement at the time, though the two later became close friends. &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S&quot; were the first two initials of the Swallow Sidecar Company which Lyons had co-founded back in 1923.

In 1940, World War II brought an end to production as the factory was turned over to produce Rolls-Royce Merlin aeroengines. After hostilities had ceased there were no suitable engines available, so the company was wound up.

==Racing career==
In 1928, George Brough recorded at Arpajon, unofficially the world&#x27;s fastest speed on a solo motorcycle.

Brough was noted for riding wearing a flat cap which he had specially made to his requirements.

It is regarded by many as the most beautiful of the West Coast lakes, and is a popular tourist and leisure destination.

== Geography ==
Lake Kaniere lies southeast of Hokitika, between two mountain ranges. At about , it is second only to Lake Brunner in size among the West Coast&#x27;s lakes. It is oriented north-south, 8 km long and 2 km wide, and has a maximum depth of 195 m. Mount Graham and Mount Upright / Te Taumata o Uekanuku are on the west coast of the lake, Tūhua on the east. The lake is included in the Lake Kaniere Scenic Reserve.

The road from Hokitika meets the northern shore of the lake at &quot;The Landing&quot; and splits; Dorothy Falls Road runs up the entire eastern side of the lake past Hans Bay and Dorothy Falls to the Styx River, while the other fork goes a short way west to Sunny Bight. A four-hour hiking trail continues down the west side of the lake before joining Dorothy Falls Road. Most of the houses at Lake Kaniere today are holiday homes, and there is a DOC campground at Hans Bay.

== Geology ==
Lake Kaniere was created by the action of glaciers in the last ice age 14,000 years ago, like many West Coast lakes. It currently drains into the Tasman Sea at its northern end via the Kaniere River, but in the past its outlet was at the southern end, emptying into the Styx River. This exit was blocked by a landslide, diverting the water north.

== Fauna ==
The streams that feed into the lake are home to several species of native fish, including common bullies, longfin eels, banded kōkopu and giant kōkopu. The lake has been stocked with fish in the past, and mostly contains brown trout and perch.

Many species of native birds can also be found on and around the lake, such as little shags, black shags, New Zealand scaup, paradise shelducks and pūkeko, and also, rarely, grey ducks. There are several pairs of whio in the Styx River at the southern end of the lake. In the surrounding forest are yellow-crowned kākāriki, ruru, rifleman, brown creeper, and sometimes kea.

Early Māori settlers found large numbers of kākāpō around the lake.

== Flora ==
Lake Kaniere Scenic Reserve is largely composed of mature rimu, and is considered one of the most ecologically-significant areas of lowland forest in the central West Coast. The rimu forest composition varies: on the flat outwash terraces, it contains rātā (&quot;Metrosideros&quot;) and kaikawaka (&quot;Libocedrus bidwillii&quot;), while on the slopes there is more supplejack (&quot;Ripogonum scandens&quot;), kiekie (&quot;Freycinetia banksii)&quot;, and miro (&quot;Prumnopitys ferruginea&quot;). In the swampier areas there are other tree species including manoao (&quot;Manoao colensoi&quot;), kaikawaka, and kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;).

== Human history ==

In pre-European times, Lake Kaniere was an important mahinga kai (food gathering place) for Māori, with longfin eels and weka being two of the most important food resources in and around the lake.

In 1909 a small hydroelectric station was built on the Kaniere River, at a cost of £15,000, to power the pumping equipment at the Ross gold mine. Water is taken near the weir at the northern end of the lake and travels 9 km through a series of tunnels and flumes to a twin power plant capable of generating 520 kW; the water race was originally used for gold sluicing in the Kaniere area. The most prominent of the wooden flumes, Johnson&#x27;s Flume, collapsed in 1973 and was replaced by earthworks. The Kaniere Forks power station later supplied the gold dredge at Rimu, and after 1931 exclusively generated power for Hokitika, today supplying 3.75 GWh annually to the town. A 3½ hour walkway follows the water race, part of the West Coast Wilderness Trail.

Lake Kaniere is a popular location for leisure activities such as camping, picknicking, jetboating, jetskiing, and water skiing. It is occasionally used by naturists for nude swimming; New Zealand has no official nude beaches, as public nudity is legal on any beach where it is &quot;known to occur&quot;. It is also the main water supply for Hokitika.

<text>Lake Mapourika is located on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It lies north of Franz Josef Glacier, and the out-flowing Ōkārito River drains it into the Ōkārito Lagoon. It is the 3rd 
largest of the West Coast lakes, a glacier formation from the last ice age. Since the water from glacial melts no longer drains into the lake, it is filled with fresh rain water which runs through the surrounding forest floor, collecting tannins, giving it its dark colour. As the winds of the region sweep high above the mountains of the Southern Alps, the water is left unruffled and quite reflective of the forest on the lake fringes.

<text>Ciara Princess Wilson ( ; Harris; born October 25, 1985) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. She was discovered by record producer Jazze Pha in the early 2000s, and rose to prominence with her debut studio album, &quot;Goodies&quot; (2004). Its namesake lead single (featuring Petey Pablo) peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the follow-ups, &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; (featuring Missy Elliott) and &quot;Oh&quot; (featuring Ludacris), both peaked at number two on the chart. The album received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and received two nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Ciara also guest appeared on the 2005 singles &quot;Lose Control&quot; by Missy Elliott and &quot;Like You&quot; by Bow Wow, both of which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Her second studio album, &quot;&quot; (2006), topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned three platinum-certified songs: the top ten single &quot;Get Up&quot; (featuring Chamillionaire) and the top 20 singles &quot;Promise&quot; and &quot;Like a Boy.&quot; Ciara&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Fantasy Ride&quot; (2009), spawned top ten single &quot;Love Sex Magic&quot; (featuring Justin Timberlake), which was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Her fourth studio album, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (2010), spawned the top 50 single &quot;Ride&quot; (featuring Ludacris). Due to the album&#x27;s commercial underperformance, Ciara signed with Epic Records to release her fifth album, &quot;Ciara&quot; (2013). It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the double platinum single &quot;Body Party&quot;. Her sixth album, &quot;Jackie&quot; (2015) spawned the platinum single &quot;I Bet&quot;.

The following year, Ciara signed a modeling contract with IMG, became a Global Brand Ambassador for the cosmetics company Revlon, and married quarterback Russell Wilson. Her seventh album and first independent release, &quot;Beauty Marks&quot; (2019), entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the platinum single &quot;Level Up&quot;. She signed with Uptown Records for the release of her first extended play, &quot;CiCi&quot; (2023).

In her acting career, she has appeared in the films &quot;All You&#x27;ve Got&quot; (2006), &quot;Mama, I Want to Sing!&quot; (2012), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012), and the television series
&quot;The Game&quot; (2013). Ciara starred in the 2023 remake of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; as Nettie. Ciara has received multiple accolades, including a Grammy Award, two BET Awards, the Woman of the Year award from Billboard Women in Music, two MTV Video Music Awards, eight Soul Train Awards, and fifteen Ascap Music Awards. As of 2019, Ciara has sold over 45 million records worldwide.

==Early life==
Ciara Princess Harris was born in Fort Hood, Texas, on October 25, 1985, the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris. An army brat, she grew up in Georgia, New York, Utah, California, Arizona, and Nevada. She was named after the Revlon fragrance Ciara which was introduced in 1973. During her teens, Ciara and her family settled in College Park, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, where she attended North Clayton High School before graduating from Riverdale.

In her mid-teens, Ciara formed the all-girl group Hearsay with two of her friends. The group recorded demos, but as time went on, they began to have differences and eventually parted ways. Despite this setback, Ciara signed a publishing deal as a songwriter.

Her first writing credit was on Blu Cantrell&#x27;s debut album, &quot;So Blu&quot;, for the song &quot;10,000 Times&quot;. She also wrote the song &quot;Got Me Waiting&quot; for R&amp;B singer Fantasia Barrino&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Free Yourself&quot;. It was when she was writing songs that she met music producer Jazze Pha, whom she called her &quot;music soulmate&quot;. In 2002, the two recorded four demos: &quot;1, 2 Step&quot;, &quot;Thug Style&quot;, &quot;Pick Up the Phone&quot;, and &quot;Lookin&#x27; at You&quot;, which all appeared on her debut album that was released two years later. &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; was the second single released from the album and it was a hit.

==Career==

===2003–2005: &quot;Goodies&quot;===
After graduating from Riverdale High School in Riverdale, Georgia, in 2003, she was signed by LaFace Records executive, L.A. Reid, whom she was introduced to by Jazze Pha. She began production on her debut album later that year. In early 2004, she wrote a demo with record producer, Sean Garrett, which came to the attention of Lil Jon and became her debut single &quot;Goodies&quot;. Lil Jon stated later that he knew it would be big seeing how it sounded similar to Usher&#x27;s international hit, &quot;Yeah!&quot;.

Ciara released her debut album &quot;Goodies&quot; on September 28, 2004. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 125,000 copies in its initial week and topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Following the release of the album, Ciara was called the &quot;First Lady of Crunk&amp;B&quot;. &quot;Goodies&quot; had a 71-week run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 10, 2006. Charting at twenty-two on the Canadian Albums Chart, it was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. The album charted at 26 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 20 weeks on the chart. It was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry.

&quot;Goodies&quot;″ lead single, the title track, featuring Petey Pablo, was released on June 8, 2004. Conceived as a crunk female counterpart to Usher&#x27;s &quot;Yeah!&quot;, the lyrical content goes against the grain, speaking of abstinence, rejecting advances because &quot;the goodies will stay in the jar.&quot; Critics hailed it as an &quot;anthem of the summer&quot; and one of the best singles of the year, complimenting its dance-feel and beat, and the irony of the &quot;clever&quot; lyrics. The single performed well worldwide, topping the charts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and charting in the top 10 of other charts, receiving Platinum certification in the United States. &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; featuring Missy Elliott was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The song peaked in the top 10 of many countries, topping the charts in Canada, and went on to become Platinum or Gold in many countries. &quot;Oh&quot; featuring Ludacris was released as the third single on March 5, 2005. The song performed well worldwide, appearing in the top 10 of seven charts, and certified either Platinum or Gold in multiple regions.

Following the success of the album, Ciara released a CD/DVD entitled &quot;&quot; in the United States on July 12, 2005, which featured remixes to &quot;1, 2 Step&quot; and &quot;Oh&quot;, as well as two new songs. The release was certified platinum in the United States. She made guest appearances on Missy Elliott&#x27;s single &quot;Lose Control&quot; and on Bow Wow&#x27;s single &quot;Like You&quot;, which both peaked at number three in the United States and obtained worldwide success. She was an opening act for Gwen Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005&quot; and went on tour with Chris Brown and Bow Wow on the &quot;Holiday Jam Tour&quot; in December 2005. At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, Ciara received four nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;1, 2 Step&quot;, Best Rap Song for Missy Elliott&#x27;s single &quot;Lose Control&quot;, and won her last nomination, Best Short Form Music Video for &quot;Lose Control&quot;.

===2006–2007: &quot;Ciara: The Evolution&quot; and acting debut===
On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, &quot;&quot;. According to the singer, the title of the album is &quot;about so much more than just my personal growth – it&#x27;s about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.&quot; The source of the album&#x27;s creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general. &quot;Ciara: The Evolution&quot; became Ciara&#x27;s first and only number one album on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and her second number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of 338,000 in the first week. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, and has sold 1.3 million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The album&#x27;s international lead single, &quot;Get Up&quot;, which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand. The song was used for the film &quot;Step Up&quot; (2006) and featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The album&#x27;s US lead single, &quot;Promise&quot;, reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;Like a Boy&quot; was released as the second international single which reached within the top 20 in the UK, Finland, France, Ireland, Sweden Switzerland, and also in the United States. The fourth and final single from the album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Leave &#x27;em Alone&quot;, reached number 10 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100.&quot; The song became Ciara&#x27;s fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4. The song achieved moderate success in other international markets.

In support of the album, Ciara went on in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest &#x27;07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold-out arena. Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad Tour&quot; in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on &quot;So What&quot; by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100.&quot; She also appeared on Tiffany Evans&#x27; single &quot;Promise Ring&quot;. The song achieved little success on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production &quot;All You&#x27;ve Got&quot; in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.

===2008–2011: &quot;Fantasy Ride&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and label change===

In October 2008, Ciara was honored as &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, because of her success as a recording artist and leadership in embracing the changing music business.
Although her third album was originally scheduled for a September 2008 release, &quot;Fantasy Ride&quot; was released after several delays in May 2009. The album combines her R&amp;B and hip hop sound from her previous albums along with a new pop and dance sound. While talking to MTV News, Ciara said, &quot;I&#x27;m having a bit more fun with my lyrics. I&#x27;m not afraid. In the beginning, I was conscious and really protective and somewhat scared about doing some things. With this album I&#x27;m not holding back, there&#x27;s freedom. It&#x27;s just the space I&#x27;m in right now.&quot; It became Ciara&#x27;s first top ten album in the UK.

&quot;Go Girl&quot; was the first single released from the album. It was originally the lead single from the album, but the single achieved minimum success and was later deemed a promo single. However, the single managed to reach the top of the charts in Japan. The album&#x27;s official lead single, &quot;Never Ever&quot;, which features Young Jeezy, was released in the United States in January 2009 and reached a peak of number nine on the U.S. Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. The second single, &quot;Love Sex Magic&quot;, featuring Justin Timberlake, became a worldwide hit, peaking within the top 10 in 20 countries including the U.S., where it peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It went on to be certified platinum in Australia and received a gold accreditation in New Zealand. It received a nomination for &quot;Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals&quot; at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards and also for Best Choreography in a Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Work&quot;, the final single, achieved moderate success in international markets.In July 2009, Ciara headlined the &quot;Jay-Z &amp; Ciara Live&quot; tour with Jay-Z. Her performance received mixed reviews; critics said although her dancing was top-notch, she seemed disconnected from the crowd. She was also the support act for Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Circus&quot; tour, where she performed eight nights at London&#x27;s prestigious O2 Arena during June 2009. Her performance received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, who noted her dancing skills as being spectacular and arguably better than Britney Spears&#x27;. Ciara made a guest appearance on Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Stepped On My J&#x27;z&quot; from his album &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot;. The song achieved minimal success in the U.S.. Ciara was also featured on Enrique Iglesias&#x27; single, &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Love&quot;, from his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. The song became an international hit, peaking in the top 10 of over 15 countries, and being certified Gold in Russia, with sales of over 100,000. In February 2010, Ciara along with Pitbull was featured on the remix to Ludacris&#x27; hit single &quot;How Low&quot;. The following month, Ciara made a cameo appearance in the music video of Usher&#x27;s single, &quot;Lil&#x27; Freak&quot;.

Ciara released her fourth studio album, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, on December 14, 2010. She told Pete Lewis of &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; magazine that the album is about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R&amp;B/urban basics, in the days of &quot;Goodies&quot; and &quot;1, 2 Step&quot;. It was executive-produced by the singer alongside her A&amp;R agent Mark Pitts and writing/production duo Tricky Stewart and The-Dream who also produced records for her previous album, &quot;Fantasy Ride&quot;. &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; debuted at number forty-four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 37,000 copies, becoming her first album to not peak within the top three. On the U.S. R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, the album opened at number 11, her only album to not peak within the top two of the chart.
The lead single, &quot;Ride&quot;, which features Ludacris, was released on April 26, 2010. It peaked at number 42 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number three on the U.S. Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming her twelfth top ten hit on the chart, and number seventy-five on the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video won the award for &quot;Best Dance Performance&quot; at the 2010 Soul Train Music Awards. &quot;Speechless&quot; was released as the second single from the album and achieved minimal success, peaking at only number 74 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;Gimmie Dat&quot;, the third single from the album was praised by critics but failed to become a hit, peaking at only 63 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number 27 on the urban charts in the UK. In November 2010, Ciara performed at the Summerbeatz tour alongside Flo Rida, Jay Sean, Akon, Travie McCoy and Ja Rule. In the summer of 2011, Ciara was a part of the Malibu Rum Tour. She performed in seven shows across the US.

In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, she released an official statement to her Facebook page complaining of inadequate promotion and funding from the label. She stated that she received a lack of support from the label, and even paid for the promotion of some singles, such as &quot;Gimmie Dat&quot;, herself. The frustration she felt while working with her third and fourth albums led her to request that she be released from her contract. In May 2011, Ciara was removed from the Jive Records website roster. On July 12, 2011, it was reported that she had reunited with L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records, and was confirmed in September 2011.

===2012–2013: &quot;Ciara&quot; and further acting===

During an interview with &quot;Sway in the Morning&quot; in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s just really about the vibe, and I&#x27;ll just tell you that it&#x27;s a good vibe going. It&#x27;s really important for me to take my time with this record and it&#x27;s important for the whole team. It&#x27;s really, really good energy.&quot; She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In an interview, Ciara said &quot;I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I&#x27;m excited about... When it comes to artists, when it comes to writers, when it comes to producers, I really wanted to push. We pretty much reached out and worked with a lot of people that I&#x27;ve never worked with before, which is really fun.&quot;

During a press conference with MTV in May 2012, Ciara announced her fifth studio album would be titled &quot;One Woman Army&quot; and said the lead single, &quot;Sweat&quot;, would be out very soon. The single, which features rapper 2 Chainz, premiered online on June 4, 2012, and was to be released via iTunes on June 19, 2012. However, the release of the single was scrapped at the last minute for unknown reasons. On August 13, 2012, Ciara revealed that the official lead single for the album would be titled &quot;Sorry&quot;. On September 13, 2012, the official music video for &quot;Sorry&quot; was premiered on BET&#x27;s 106 &amp; Park as well as VEVO. &quot;Sorry&quot; was made available for purchase as a digital download on September 25, 2012, and impacted U.S. Urban contemporary and Rhythmic radio stations on October 9, 2012. In the United States, &quot;Sorry&quot; reached a peak at 40 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart while charting at number 22 on Billboard&#x27;s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart listing of the top 25 songs that have yet to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On October 21, 2012, &quot;Rap-Up&quot; magazine posted a behind-the-scenes sneak peek of &quot;Got Me Good&quot;, the second single from the album. The song and video, which was directed by Joseph Kahn, premiered on the Sony JumboTron in Times Square in New York City on October 25, 2012. The single was released via digital download on November 6, 2012. &quot;Got Me Good&quot; impacted rhythmic radio on November 13, and mainstream radio on December 4.

On April 15, 2013, the same day the album&#x27;s track listing was revealed, it was also announced that the album is not titled &quot;One Woman Army&quot; anymore and that the new title is &quot;Ciara&quot;. Due to their low performance on the charts, the label decided not to include &quot;Sweat&quot;, &quot;Sorry&quot;, and &quot;Got Me Good&quot; on the tracklist. Instead, it was later announced that a new song titled &quot;Body Party&quot; would serve as the lead single. It was released in March 2013 and reached number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the U.S. Billboard &quot;Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs&quot; chart. The second single was &quot;I&#x27;m Out&quot; featuring Nicki Minaj. The album was released on July 9, 2013. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 59,000 copies in the U.S. The album became Ciara&#x27;s fourth album to chart within the top three of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The album charted at number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums&lt;ref name=&quot;US Billboard R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from music in 2012, Ciara also starred in two movies during this time. She starred in the straight-to-DVD film, &quot;Mama, I Want to Sing!&quot;. She played Amara Winter, a preacher&#x27;s daughter who was discovered by a well-established musician. She appeared as Brie in the 2012 comedy film, &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot;. Ciara made an appearance as herself playing Lauren London&#x27;s best friend on the Season 6 premiere of BET&#x27;s &quot;The Game&quot; which aired on March 26, 2013, she continued to be a recurring cast member throughout the season.

=== 2014–2016: &quot;Jackie&quot; and motherhood ===

In September 2013, producer Mike WiLL Made It revealed that Ciara had begun work on her sixth studio album. In December 2013, Ciara confirmed she was in the process of making a new album. During an interview with &quot;Rap-Up&quot; magazine Ciara revealed that recording for her sixth album began around Thanksgiving of 2013 and she would be releasing new music &quot;really soon&quot;. In late January 2014, Ciara premiered a live version of a song entitled &quot;Anytime&quot; at the Degree Women Grammys Celebration in Los Angeles, on February 2, 2014, Ciara premiered the studio version, produced Boi-1da and Katalyst featuring her then-boyfriend and rapper Future.
After her engagement to Future, Ciara revealed to &quot;W&quot; in April 2014 that her sixth studio album would be predominantly inspired by her then-fiancé. Ciara gave birth to her first child in May 2014, a boy fathered by Future. After claims of Future&#x27;s infidelity during their relationship had surfaced, it was reported that the couple&#x27;s engagement had been called off. Following their very public break-up, Ciara&#x27;s album release was further postponed to 2015, and during this time the singer &quot;quietly&quot; recorded new music, while concentrating on motherhood.

&quot;I Bet&quot;, the lead single from her album &quot;Jackie&quot;, was released on January 26, 2015.
In May 2015, Ciara embarked on her first headlining tour in six years. The month-long Jackie Tour kicked off on May 3, 2015, in Chicago and included stops in New York, Boston, New Orleans, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The first round of US dates wrapped May 31 in San Francisco.
Ciara&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Jackie&quot;, was released on May 1, 2015. It includes the singles &quot;I Bet&quot; and &quot;Dance like We&#x27;re Making Love&quot;. The album debuted at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 25,000 units (19,900 in sales), and has the lowest first-week sales amongst her first six albums.

After appearing in the US talent show, &quot;I Can Do That&quot;, she host the 2016 edition of the Billboard Music Awards. A few months later, she announced during the red-carpet of the American Music Awards that she was pregnant.

=== 2017–2021: &quot;Beauty Marks&quot; and entrepreneur projects ===

During 2016, Ciara worked on her seventh studio album and stated that the album would feature her undertaking a new musical direction. On January 27, 2017, it was announced that Ciara had signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records. On July 17, 2018, Ciara released the single and its accompanying music video, &quot;Level Up&quot;. The song was the first single from her seventh studio album &quot;Beauty Marks&quot;, released on May 10, 2019. In addition to &quot;Level Up&quot;, the album spawned the singles &quot;Freak Me&quot;, &quot;Dose&quot;, &quot;Greatest Love&quot; and &quot;Thinkin Bout You&quot;. Ciara performed &quot;Thinkin Bout You&quot; at the 2019 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

In July 2019, it was announced that Ciara would appear as a judge alongside David Dobrik and Debbie Gibson in a new musical competition on Nickelodeon titled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Musical Family&quot;. On December 23, 2019, Ciara featured on the remix of longtime friend Blanco Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Git Up&quot;.

After taking a break from music to focus on her pregnancy, Ciara released a song and video titled &quot;Rooted&quot;, featuring Ester Dean, on August 13, 2020. Between 2020 and 2021, Ciara and her husband Russell Wilson embarked on several business projects, opening the fashion house The House of LR&amp;C, and signed a first look deal with Amazon Studios to start Why Not You Productions.

===2022–present: &quot;CiCi&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot;===
In March 2022, it was announced that Ciara had joined the cast of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; as Nettie Harris. &quot;The Color Purple&quot; was released in the United States on December 25, 2023, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Ciara appeared on the cover of the 2022 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot;, making her the third musician to do so since the issue launched in 1964.

On June 29, 2022, it was announced that Ciara had signed a new record deal with Republic and Uptown Records, in partnership with her label, Beauty Marks Entertainment. Ciara&#x27;s eighth studio album will be released through the partnership. The first release from the deal was announced to be the single, &quot;Jump&quot;, released on July 8, 2022. In September 2022, it was insinuated that Ciara had collaborated with Summer Walker for a second time. On September 28, 2022, Ciara released the uptempo single &quot;Better Thangs&quot;, which features Walker. The official music video, directed by Mia Barnes premiered online on September 30, 2022. On choosing Walker to collaborate with, Ciara divulged &quot;I&#x27;ve always done collaborations because it felt right, it was authentic. It felt like the artist was going to bring a certain flair to this song that it needed… I played [Summer Walker] a few songs on the album and [...] this is the one song that I thought was perfect for her, but I wanted it for her because she also really liked it.&quot; The single has reached 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult R&amp;B Songs chart, becoming Ciara&#x27;s first top twenty hit on the chart. In November 2022 a remix of &quot;Better Thangs&quot; featuring rapper GloRilla was released.

On March 24, 2023, Ciara released the single &quot;Da Girls&quot;, which was followed on April 14, 2023, with a remix with Lola Brooke and Lady London.

==Artistry==

===Vocals and musical style===

Ciara is known for her often &quot;breathy soprano&quot; vocals. Allison Stewart of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented that she has a &quot;reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&amp;B singer needs&quot;. Randall Roberts of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that she &quot;has been the most synthetic of the R&amp;B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines, and, often, weird, futuristic Gary Numan-esque bleeps woven through.&quot; He further commented: &quot;Ciara&#x27;s sights are mostly set on one aspect of said universal truth -- desire -- and how it manifests itself on the dance floor ... at the mall ... or in the bedroom... Ciara&#x27;s debut album featured production from Jazze Pha. In reviewing the album, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; noted the influence of Destiny&#x27;s Child, and compared some of its material to Aaliyah&#x27;s, albeit &quot;less sexy&quot;. In reviewing her second album &quot;&quot;, Jody Rosen of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Ciara&#x27;s comfort with rave-inspired beats sets her apart from Cassie, Amerie, Rihanna, and other would-Beyoncés...[Her] singing is nimble throughout: She whispers, coos, wails, and reels off speedy syncopations worthy of Beyoncé herself.&quot; Her third album, &quot;Fantasy Ride&quot;, saw the singer showcasing a new pop and dance direction, which she recalled later on her sixth album &quot;Jackie&quot;. Ciara&#x27;s music is generally contemporary R&amp;B, but it also incorporates other genres including hip hop, crunk, dance-pop, electropop and funk. Critics have described her singles &quot;Goodies&quot;, &quot;1, 2 Step&quot;, &quot;Get Up&quot;, and &quot;Go Girl&quot; as club bangers. Ciara has also dabbled in gospel, country, and afrobeats.

===Influences===
Ciara said that watching Destiny&#x27;s Child and Janet Jackson perform on television inspired her to pursue a career in music, and cites Jackson and her brother Michael as her biggest inspirations. Ciara considered herself to reach &quot;a career pinnacle&quot; when she featured on Janet Jackson&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Discipline&quot;. Ciara spoke of Michael Jackson&#x27;s legacy, &quot;Whenever someone asks me who inspires me to do what I do, I always say Michael. That&#x27;s it for me. He&#x27;s everything to me. He&#x27;s really a part of the reason why. He&#x27;s going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it&#x27;s important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music.&quot;

Ciara also cites TLC, Jodeci, Sade, Frank Sinatra, Aaliyah, and Whitney Houston as some of her other musical influences. Her second studio album &quot;&quot; (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.
During the recording of her fifth self-titled album &quot;Ciara&quot; (2013), she was inspired by Al Green and Missy Elliott.

===Stage presence, dancing, and music videos===

Ciara has generally received praise for her stage presence and routines during live performances. Dalondo Moultrie of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; applauded Ciara&#x27;s stage presence saying that she &quot;put on one of the best performances I have seen yet at [Crocodile Rock]&quot;. Moultrie continued to call her dance steps &quot;incredible&quot;, notings her &quot;pelvic thrusts&quot;, &quot;body bending twists&quot;, &quot;periodic bursts of light&quot;, and commending her for being in sync with the music. In summary, he praised Ciara&#x27;s live performances for their &quot;high-energy songs, sexy dance moves, flawless vocals, and [the] top-flight light show&quot;. Sia Michel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised Ciara&#x27;s relentless professional presence stating: &quot;Ciara led a squad of hip-hop dancers through stylishly choreographed routines. Striding about in a headset, she was a commanding and relentlessly professional presence.&quot; Bill White of &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote that due to Ciara&#x27;s high energy, &quot;it hardly mattered that she was singing to backing tracks ... Usually this type of performance seems cut-rate and dishonest, but Ciara, with the help of slick lighting and sharp choreography, made it work&quot;.

Ciara has still gotten some criticism for her performances, typically relating to her vocals. Jon Caramanica of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a mixed reception of Ciara&#x27;s performance ability, writing that her physical style reduced her emotional impact, and that her &quot;lack of vocal presence guarantees that it is easier to connect with her music physically than emotionally.&quot; Vincent Jackson of &quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot; also noted Ciara&#x27;s limited vocal ability when critiquing her , but praised her confidence and approved of her decision &quot;to put most of her energy into her almost nonstop, aerobic dance performance&quot;.

Dance is big part of Ciara&#x27;s artistry and music videos.
Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bim Adewunmi said &quot;She makes music to dance to, and her videos are testament to that ... Ciara&#x27;s currency as a dancer is precision and high difficulty. Her body becomes a sort of human syncopated beat – an urgent thing, parts moving seemingly independently but all working to a greater good. On a purely technical level, her dancing is damn near untouchable&quot;. Ciara&#x27;s dancing is generally praised and she&#x27;s often considered one of the best or most emulable dancers in music. Ciara&#x27;s dance ability has been compared to Michael and Janet Jackson. Her dancing is often described as sexy, energetic, and precise. Ciara is noted for her often tomboyish dance aesthetic and androgynous choreography, particularly in her videos for 1, 2 Step and Like A Boy. Ciara&#x27;s style of dancing is generally street, but she has also done ballroom and step in her videos and performances. Ciara also did an interpretive dance routine in pointe shoes for her I Bet music video, though her use of the shoes prompted some backlash from the ballet community.

===Alter ego===

At the time of &quot;Fantasy Ride&#x27;s&quot; (2009) release, Ciara introduced her alter ego &quot;Super C&quot;. Ciara said that Super C is her &quot;inner strength and aggressive persona&quot; – a futuristic, superhero-esque woman, loosely based on the robotic character Ciara portrayed in the &quot;Go Girl&quot; music video. Ciara described her reasoning for developing an alter ego, &quot;There&#x27;s so much negative energy in the world, especially within the blogging world, they try so hard to tear you down. [With the superhero concept] it&#x27;s like, &#x27;I refuse to let you and that negative energy tear me down or stop any blessing that I know is there for me.&#x27; That&#x27;s when the inner superhero comes out.&quot;

==Impact==

With the release of her debut single &quot;Goodies&quot;, Ciara was dubbed the Princess of Crunk or the First Lady of Crunk&amp;B. In the early to mid-2000s, &quot;Goodies&quot; along with other crunk music hits like &quot;Get Low&quot;, &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Freek-a-Leek&quot; produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. &quot;Yeah!&quot; and &quot;Goodies&quot; were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&amp;B, called crunk&amp;B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the top mainstream hits of 2004. Since then, crunk&amp;B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&amp;B on the charts in 2008. &quot;Goodies&quot; spent seven weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977.

The album&#x27;s lead single&#x27;s success exemplified urban music&#x27;s commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts by R&amp;B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&amp;B hits that year. Along with Usher&#x27;s streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&amp;B charts were topped by OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, Terror Squad&#x27;s &quot;Lean Back&quot;, and Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot;. Chris Molanphy of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; later remarked that &quot;by the early 2000s, urban music &quot;was&quot; pop music.&quot;

Ciara is considered to be &quot;one of the most reliable suppliers&quot; of beat-driven party music and the female face of crunk. Her debut album has been credited with helping &quot;return R&amp;B to Atlanta&quot; and setting the standard for a new generation of R&amp;B singers. Many female R&amp;B and K-pop acts have had their image or style of music compared to Ciara&#x27;s. Ciara peaked commercially in the mid-2000s, but she continued releasing hit songs in the 2010s. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Natalie Weiner said that Ciara&#x27;s 2013 hit &quot;Body Party&quot; was &quot;one of [her] biggest and most critically acclaimed songs&quot;. It was certified double platinum in the U.S. and received numerous accolades. Ciara&#x27;s 2015 single &quot;I Bet&quot; also went platinum in the U.S. Pitchfork journalist Katherine St. Asaph took note of Ciara&#x27;s longevity, and responded to her reemergence in 2018:
&quot;Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot; came out almost 15 years ago. That&#x27;s a testament to just how improbably resilient Ciara&#x27;s career has been. Though she&#x27;s never quite regained that initial &quot;princess of crunk-n-B&quot; level of mainstream stardom, she has sustained a cult fanbase and delivered a remarkably consistent run of songs to back it up. 

Ciara&#x27;s viral 2018 hit &quot;Level Up&quot; was likely the most saturated hit single of her career. Along with the wildly popular #LevelUp dance challenge that accompanied, the song was pushed to the forefront of Arizona politician Mark Kelly&#x27;s winning campaign for the senate. The song is also noted for helping to bring Jersey and Baltimore club music to the mainstream, with the former being incorporated into its production. Ciara&#x27;s music in general is popular and influential amongst club and underground music producers, with many remixes sampling her voice gaining popularity over the years. Canadian underground producer Jacques Greene was convinced to prioritize his music career after his song &quot;Another Girl&quot;, which leaned on her vocals, gained traction. Latin R&amp;B artist Rauw Alejandro admired Ciara early in his career because her music was &#x27;club-friendly&#x27; and &#x27;ripe for remixing&#x27;.

Ciara has been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&amp;B for her contributions. According to &quot;The Fader&quot;, Ciara positioned herself as a &quot;tomboyish, androgynous alternative&quot; to her peers and the gender-swapping looks from her &quot;Like A Boy&quot; video both predates similar efforts from artists like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, and made gender-swapping &quot;cool&quot; for female popstars. The publication also said her dance videos created a template for artists like Tinashe and raised discussion on female sexuality before feminism became more prominent in the music industry. On July 28, 2024, Ciara was honored with her own official day in Atlanta.

Ciara has been cited as a musical influence or inspiration by many artists, including Ari Lennox, Baby Tate, Chloe × Halle, DaniLeigh, Dawn Richard, Dua Lipa, Flo, Girls&#x27; Generation, Grimes, Haim, Iza, Jackson Wang, Jesy Nelson, Jhené Aiko, Kehlani, Keke Palmer, Kyla, LaTocha Scott, Latto, Layton Greene, Lil Mama, Masego, Normani, Rauw Alejandro, Scott Hoying, Tate McRae, Taylor Swift, Tierra Whack, Tinashe, Victoria Monét, and 2ne1. Ciara&#x27;s public relationships have inspired K. Michelle and Summer Walker to release tracks titled &quot;Ciara&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Ciara became engaged to rapper Future, with whom she has a son, born on May 19, 2014. She ended their engagement in August 2014. 

Ciara began dating NFL quarterback Russell Wilson in early 2015. They announced their engagement on March 11, 2016. They married on July 6 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England. Ciara took Wilson&#x27;s last name when they married. She and Wilson have three children together, born in 2017, 2020 and 2023 respectively.

Ciara identifies as a Christian.

==Other ventures==
===Business===
Ciara became the face of Jay-Z&#x27;s Rocawear clothing line and spokesperson for the women campaign titled &quot;I Will Not Lose&quot;, which debuted in the summer of 2007. In the October issue of &quot;Vibe Magazine&quot;, she appeared, apparently nude, on the magazine cover but claimed &quot;Vibe&quot; had airbrushed her clothes off. She told &quot;MTV News&quot; that she was hurt by the photos and was quite shocked when she finally got her hands on the month&#x27;s issue. She later confirmed that she was in fact clothed.

In 2009, Ciara signed a multimillion-dollar deal with the modeling agency Wilhelmina Models. After signing the deal, she has been in many magazine spreads. In addition to that, she also has her eyes set on beginning a new clothing line. In June 2008, she was in talks with the department store Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s to create an affordable clothing line, but it never happened. On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Ciara would be modeling in the German edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;. During that time, it was also announced that Ciara would be the new face of a major multimedia ad campaign for Verizon&#x27;s smartphone the LG Chocolate Touch. Ciara filmed a commercial for the campaign, which features her dancing to her 2009 single, &quot;Work&quot;. In March 2010, it was officially confirmed and announced that Ciara was the spokesperson in the new ad campaign for Adidas Originals. A commercial for the campaign was released the same month, featuring numerous other celebrities.

On May 12, 2016, it was announced that Ciara signed a modeling contract with IMG. Later that year, she became a Global Brand Ambassador for the cosmetics giant Revlon.

In August 2019, she and her husband Russell Wilson became part of the ownership group of Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer.

In 2020, along with her husband and entrepreneur and mentor Christine Day, she founded the fashion house The House of LR&amp;C, combining the Good Man Brand, LITA by Ciara and Human Nation collections. In 2021, Ciara releases the Dare To Roam collection of recycled plastic backpacks and bags. A year later, The House of LR&amp;C received B Corp status.

Ciara, along with her husband, owns the television entertainment, advertising, and film production company Why Not You Productions, which has been affiliated with Amazon Prime Video since 2021.

In October 2021, Ciara has joined Caribbean rum brand Ten To One Rum as an investor and co-owner. Ciara will be responsible for marketing, creative, and business development, as well as strategic alliances, in her new position.

In September 2021, Ciara and Wilson announced that they were writing a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Why Not You?&quot; (Random House, 2022) to help kids pursue their dreams. The book, cowritten with JaNay Brown-Wood and released on March 1, 2022, received a starred review from &quot;School Library Journal&quot; and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

Later in August, Ciara would announce the launch of her skincare line, &quot;On A Mission&quot;, set for mid-September.

===Philanthropy===

In September 2008, Ciara contributed to the song &quot;Just Stand Up!&quot; with fifteen other female artists, who shared the stage to perform the song live on September 5, 2008, during the &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; television special. The proceeds from the single were given to the fundraiser. The television special helped raise $100 million for cancer research.

In 2009, Ciara became the face of Dosomething.org&#x27;s &quot;Do Something 101&quot; campaign to raise school supplies for those in need at the start of the school year. She filmed a public service announcement to endorse the campaign.

In December 2017, Ciara joined her husband&#x27;s nonprofit &#x27;Why Not You&#x27; Foundation as a board director. Through the foundation, she would eventually open a charter school called Why Not You Academy in June 2021 following an announcement eight months prior. They would also partner with the NFL Players Association and Goalsetter to open checking accounts for students at Denny International Middle School with a donation of $35,000 in May 2021. Ciara would later partner with the Black Women&#x27;s Health Imperative and Hologic&#x27;s Project Health Equality on their collaborative &#x27;Cerving Confidence&#x27; campaign to raise awareness about the disproportionate effects of cervical cancer on black women.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Ciara donated one million meals to Food Lifeline to help the Puget Sound Region.

<doc id="1126579" wikidata="Q856902" url="?curid=1126579" title="Bidder's organ">
<text>Bidder&#x27;s organ is a spherical, brownish organ in most members of the family Bufonidae (true toads). The organ is located just in front of the kidney, or mesonephros. It is formed at the cranial tip of the male and female gonad during the larval stage. Its main function appears to be endocrine, taking part in regulating sex hormones.

Normally, it contains miniature egg follicles which have the capability to mature (becoming active). Zoologists have experimented with the physiology of the organ by castrating male toads (removing the testicles). In doing so, the Bidder&#x27;s organ enlarges and produces viable oocytes (egg cells). Only rudimentary oviducts are developed, though, preventing eggs from actually being laid. The Bidder&#x27;s organ only develops into an ovary analogue when testicles are removed experimentally or not functioning properly (e.g. due to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals). Importantly, females can have Bidder&#x27;s organs in addition to true ovaries, which suggests that the Bidder&#x27;s organ might not be a rudimentary ovary.

It is named in honour of Friedrich Bidder.

==Anatomy==
The organ&#x27;s internal anatomy consists of two parts; the central portion, consisting of connective tissue and rich in blood vessels, and its periphery, consisting of the cortex, which contains follicles in various stages of development. Molecules of various proteins are present in the outer layer of the follicles, homologous to the zona pellucida of the ovum. The physiology of the Bidder&#x27;s organ is unique, having no connection with temperature-dependent sex determination (i.e., reptiles, avians, and mammals).

<text>Hester Shaw, later known as Hester Natsworthy, is the lead heroine of Philip Reeve&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot;.

==Background and life==
Hester Shaw, aged around fifteen at the beginning of the Quartet, is the daughter of Thaddeus Valentine and Pandora Shaw. She was raised by Shrike.

Hester is portrayed as having copper hair and a gray eye. She has a scar which cut her face from forehead to jaw, a wrenched mouth, a stump nose, and a single eye.

The character&#x27;s surname comes from Shaugh Prior.

==Role==
In the first novel of the &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot; (known in the US as &quot;The Hungry City Chronicles&quot;), &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, her botched assassination attempt on Thaddeus Valentine led to her meeting Tom Natsworthy and set off a chain of events that would change the course of history. She is a key character in each book in the Quartet, often in the center of conflicts that occur. She is the mother of Wren Natsworthy.

==In other media==
In the &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; student short film made in 2009, Alyssa Burnett plays Hester. One of her photos in the role has been mistakenly identified as a cosplay.

There is a 28mm figure based on Hester Shaw.

In &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;, the film adaptation of the first book, Hester is portrayed by Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar as an adult, while the young Hester is played by New Zealand child actress Poppy Macleod. Her scar is heavily toned down, and she is aged to her twenties. Hilmar described her character as challenging to play. Christian Rivers, the director of the film, addressed the fan criticism over Hester&#x27;s scar, stating that audiences would be &quot;put off the film&quot; if it were more true to the books. The author acknowledged the difference. Reviewers from FilmBook, Screen Rant, and USA Today remarked that this rendition of Hester lacks character development. Other changes include: she lost her mother when she was eight and she fought Valentine aboard his airship.

<text>José Basco y Pérez de Vargas, 1st Count of the Conquest of Batanes Islands ( (1731–1805) was a naval officer of the Spanish Navy who served as the 53rd governor of the Spanish Philippines under the Spanish Empire, from 1778 to 1787. An &quot;economic minded&quot; governor-general in Spanish-ruled Philippines, his rule tried to subjugate the Ivatan natives of Batanes, which led to the death of the indigenous Ivatan hero, Aman Dangat.

==Governor General of the Philippines==
He established the &quot;Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País&quot;, or the &quot;Economic Society of Friends of the Country&quot;, which revived the tobacco industry in the Spanish Philippines. He established the basis for the massive growth of Philippine agricultural export, with a policy of tolerance towards (theoretically) illegal activity of foreign retailers, mainly the English and North Americans, who went to Manila to complete their product shipments. He also made the colony less dependent on the Viceroyalty of New Spain by freeing the Philippine and other Pacific Islands from the control of New Spain. Hoping to free the Philippines from Mexican and Chinese trade, Basco established reforms including incentivizing the production of cotton, spices, sugarcane, and mining, as well as rewarding scientific reforms.

In 1782, Basco sent an expedition to conduct the formalities of acquiring the Ivatans&#x27; consent to become subjects of the King of Spain. The Ivatans, with their elders and leaders, such as the heroic Aman Dangat, revolted against Spanish rule in response.

Regardless, on June 26, 1783, Joseph Huelva y Melgarjo was declared by the Spanish government as the first Governor of Batanes. The new province was named Provincia de la Concepcion, and Governor General Basco was named “Conde de la Conquista de Batanes”. The capital town, Basco, was named after him.

By January 21, 1789, King Carlos III granted as a prize for his numerous services the title of &quot;Count of Conquista of the Batanes Islands&quot;; grace to which he added to the appointments of Squad leader and Governor of Cartagena. Basco was replaced by Pedro de Sarrio on November 22, 1787.

<doc id="1126588" wikidata="Q1437219" url="?curid=1126588" title="Batan Island">
<text>Batan Island ( ) is the main island of Batanes, an archipelagic province in the Philippines. It is the second largest of the Batanes Islands, the northernmost group of islands in the Philippines.

==Geography==
Batan is a dumbbell-shaped volcanic island, part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. The northern part of the island is dominated by the high active volcano, Mount Iraya, which last erupted in 1454. The lower portion of the island is the inactive volcano Mount Matarem, about tall. A hilly narrow neck of land, about long and from wide, separates the two volcanoes of the island. At around the vicinity of Mount Matarem, the island is at its widest at about .

Sabtang Island, the nearest island to Batan is located about southwest of the southern tip of the island. Itbayat, the largest island of the archipelago, is about northwest of the central part of Batan.

==Geology==
The Batan Volcanic Complex includes the Pliocene Matarem composite volcano of basalt and andesite flows, 5.8 to 1.7 Ma, on the southern part of the island, and the Quaternary Mt. Iraya basalt and andesite lava flows on the northern part of the island. The central isthmus has an outcrop of Late Miocene andesitic flows, 9 - 7 Ma. Western Mt. Iraya has a pyroclastic flow deposit dated 1,480 years B.P., that includes ash and pumice. The periphery of Mt. Matarem includes lahar and tuffaceous deposits. The Miocene Batan Group are sedimentary rocks that includes the Liguan, Caracaran and Bilbao formations. The Middle Miocene Bilbao limestone overlies the Early Miocene Caracaran siltstone, which overlies the Liguan limestone. The Liguan and Bilbao include coal measures up to 300 meters thick.

==History==
=== Japanese invasion ===
The Japanese invasion of the Philippines began with the invasion of Batan Island by a 490-man naval combat unit and a number of air corps troops aboard two transports that were escorted by one destroyer and four torpedo boats. This was the first landing on American territory, which transpired on the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Japanese forces quickly secured the existing small airfield outside Basco without resistance and began expansion work immediately as a forward base of operations against Luzon. Work was discontinued only a few days later as the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered an airfield in Basco redundant. On 10 December 1941, the naval combat force was redeployed.

== Governance ==
Four of the six municipalities of Batanes are located on the long island including the provincial capital of Basco. The other municipalities are Ivana, Mahatao and Uyugan.

<doc id="1126590" wikidata="Q251281" url="?curid=1126590" title="Álvaro Saborío">
<text>Álvaro Alberto Saborío Chacón (; born 25 March 1982) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer, who played as a forward. Saborío originally retired in 2017 but returned months later.

A full international for Costa Rica since 2002, Saborío has over 110 caps and 36 goals for the nation, whom he represented at five CONCACAF Gold Cups, in addition to one tournament each at the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, and Copa América.

==Club career==
Saborío is a product of C.F. Monterrey&#x27;s youth system. He played with the club&#x27;s reserve team in the Segunda División de México and with affiliate Coyotes de Saltillo in the Primera A.

===Deportivo Saprissa===
Saborio began his professional career with Saprissa in his native Costa Rica. He made his Costa Rican Primera División debut against Limonense on 8 August 2001. Saborío was the leading goal-scorer of the 2003–2004 Costa Rican season, finishing the year with 25 goals, five above Whayne Wilson.

With Saprissa, he has won a league title and a CONCACAF Champions Cup and was part of the team that played the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship Toyota Cup, where Saprissa finished third behind São Paulo and Liverpool. At the tournament, he scored two goals and ended up tied with three other players for top scoring honors.

===FC Sion===
He moved to Swiss Super League outfit FC Sion after playing for Costa Rica at the 2006 World Cup. He formed a good partnership at FC Sion with Poland&#x27;s Zbigniew Zakrzewski.

His performances in Switzerland reportedly caught the eye of Stoke City&#x27;s manager Tony Pulis who aimed to sign him in the summer of 2009, however he instead joined Bristol City on loan.

===Bristol City===
Saborío played his first game for Bristol City in a Championship match on 13 September against Coventry City making an impact by setting up fellow striker Nicky Maynard. Saborío also picked up his first yellow card in English football as the match ended in a 1–1 draw. Saborio scored his first goal for Bristol City in their 1–1 draw with Scunthorpe United.

He left Bristol City, and his contract was terminated with FC Sion in February 2010 so that he could return to Costa Rica.

===Real Salt Lake===

Saborío signed with Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake in March 2010. He made a huge impact in his first season in Salt Lake: RSL boasted the highest-scoring offense in MLS in 2010 (45 goals); Saborío led the way with a team-high 12 tallies. For his efforts, he earned the MLS Newcomer of the Year award. He also starred for the club in the CONCACAF Champions League tournament, scoring eight goals as Real Salt Lake advanced to the championship round.

After a successful first season at the club, Saborío was made Salt Lake&#x27;s first ever Designated Player, signing a four-year contract with the club on 1 December 2010.

Saborío became the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, and their key target man. As of 5 May 2012, Saborío had scored 38 goals across all competitions, eight of them coming from CONCACAF Champions League play.

On 18 November 2013 Saborío was named FutbolMLS.com&#x27;s Latino del Año.

Saborío scored a goal in the 52nd minute of the 2013 MLS Cup on 7 December. His goal was equalized by Aurélien Collin in the 76th minute. He later missed his penalty kick when the game went into a penalty kick shoutout, in which Sporting Kansas City won.

===D.C. United===
On 16 July 2015, Saborío was traded to D.C. United for Luis Silva. He scored his first goal for United on 26 July 2015, against the Philadelphia Union. On 2 October 2015, Saborío scored a stoppage time winner against New York City FC to clinch United a spot in the 2015 MLS Playoffs.

Saborío re-signed with United on 17 November 2015.

On 14 November 2016, Saborío announced that he was to leave United after two seasons. He played 31 games, scored 10 goals, and contributed 10 assists for D.C. United.

===Deportivo Saprissa===
On 10 January 2017, Saborío signed a one-year contract with Deportivo Saprissa. On 9 February 2017, Saborío announced his retirement due to conflicts with Saprissa fans.

===San Carlos===
Saborío was a leading figure in San Carlos&#x27; double championship: first in the second division, and once in the first division, they won the Torneo de Clausura for the 2018-2019 season.

==International career==
Saborío was an important player for the Costa Rica national team at numerous levels. He represented the U-23 team at the 2004 Olympics, scoring the qualifying goal that took them there, and subsequently started three of four games for the team, scoring a goal against Portugal.

Saborío made his senior debut for Costa Rica in an October 2002 friendly match against Ecuador and has, as of October 2021, earned a total of 112 caps, scoring 36 goals, placing him third at his country&#x27;s all-time goalscorers list behind Rolando Fonseca and Paulo Wanchope.

Saborío, better known as &quot;Pipe&quot;, has been notably recognized for his accomplishments with Deportivo Saprissa, and the high number of goals he scored in a short period. But after a year at the club his Costa Rican coach got a hold of him and he took part in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He was mostly a substitute for the side, behind Rónald Gómez and former Manchestet City forward Paulo Wanchope. He also scored the first goal ever in the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica, in the inaugural match against China. Saborío was at the centre of much controversy in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, criticized heavily for his misses, including two penalty kicks in the quarterfinals against Honduras, and for a training pitch incident where he allegedly kicked a ball at a child who was in the stands.

Saborío scored eight times in Costa Rica&#x27;s successful 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, including a hat-trick in a 4–0 away win over Guyana on 12 June 2012, and a further two goals on 16 October in a 7–0 win over the same opponents. On 12 May 2014, Saborío was named to Costa Rica&#x27;s 30-man preliminary roster for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. However, on 29 May, the Costa Rican Football Federation confirmed that Saborío had broken the fifth metatarsal bone in his left foot during a training session with the national team and would subsequently miss the World Cup.

Saborío was in Costa Rica&#x27;s squad for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup and earned his 100th cap on 11 July at the BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, assisting Bryan Ruiz&#x27;s goal in a 1–1 Group B draw with El Salvador; he was the fifth Costa Rican to make one hundred appearances.

==Personal life==
A son of former Costa Rica international Álvaro Grant MacDonald and Marlene Saborío, Saborío can speak four languages: Portuguese, Spanish, French and English.

<text>Stadion Galgenwaard () is a football stadium in Utrecht, Netherlands. It has been the home of the FC Utrecht since 1970. The stadium, which underwent a renovation starting at the beginning of the 21st century, has a capacity of 23,750 spectators.

The stadium reopened in 1982 after an extensive facelift. At the time it was one of the most modern stadiums in the world, especially due to the moat around the pitch. After twenty years FC Utrecht felt the need for expansion and renewal. The main stand was moved to the North side and opened for the start of the 2001–2002 season.

The old main stand was rebuilt after that and a year later FC Utrecht had two new stands along the sides of the pitch. Last season, the goal stands were replaced, and the stadium now has 23,750 seats.

Seven international matches of the Netherlands national football team have been played in the stadium. The first was a friendly on 27 April 1983 against Sweden which ended 3–0 for the visitors. The most recent, played on 3 September 2004, was also a friendly: a 3–0 win against Liechtenstein.

The stadium was also the host of 2 World Cup finals. In 1998, the Netherlands field hockey team became world champions, beating Spain in the final 3–2. In 2005, the final of the Football World Youth Championship was played in the Galgenwaard. Argentina won, beating Nigeria 2–1.

During the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2017, the stadium hosted 4 group stage matches.

<doc id="1126592" wikidata="Q7698942" url="?curid=1126592" title="Temporally ordered routing algorithm">
<text>The Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) is an algorithm for routing data across Wireless Mesh Networks or Mobile ad hoc networks.

It was developed by Vincent Park and Scott Corson at the University of Maryland and the Naval Research Laboratory. Park has patented his work, and it was licensed by Nova Engineering, who are marketing a wireless router product based on Park&#x27;s algorithm.

==Operation==
The TORA attempts to achieve a high degree of scalability using a &quot;flat&quot;, non-hierarchical routing algorithm. In its operation the algorithm attempts to suppress, to the greatest extent possible, the generation of far-reaching control message propagation. In order to achieve this, the TORA does not use a shortest path solution, an approach which is unusual for routing algorithms of this type.

TORA builds and maintains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rooted at a destination. No two nodes may have the same height.

Information may flow from nodes with higher heights to nodes with lower heights. Information can therefore be thought of as a fluid that may only flow downhill. By maintaining a set of totally ordered heights at all times, TORA achieves loop-free multipath routing, as information cannot &#x27;flow uphill&#x27; and so cross back on itself.

The key design concepts of TORA is localization of control messages to a very small set of nodes near the occurrence of a topological change. To accomplish this, nodes need to maintain the routing information about adjacent (one hop) nodes. The protocol performs three basic functions:
* Route creation
* Route maintenance
* Route erasure
During the route creation and maintenance phases, nodes use a height metric to establish a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rooted at destination. Thereafter links are assigned based on the relative height metric of neighboring nodes. During the times of mobility the DAG is broken and the route maintenance unit comes into picture to reestablish a DAG routed at the destination.

Timing is an important factor for TORA because the height metric is dependent on the logical time of the link failure. TORA&#x27;s route erasure phase is essentially involving flooding a broadcast clear packet (CLR) throughout the network to erase invalid routes.

===Route creation===
A node which requires a link to a destination because it has no downstream neighbours for it sends a QRY (query) packet and sets its (formerly unset) route-required flag. A QRY packet contains the destination id of the node a route is sought to. The reply to a query is called an update UPD packet. It contains the height quintuple of the neighbour node answering to a query and the destination field which tells for which destination the update was meant for.
A node receiving a QRY packet does one of the following:
* If its route required flag is set, this means that it doesn&#x27;t have to forward the QRY, because it has itself already issued a QRY for the destination, but better discard it to prevent message overhead.
* If the node has no downstream links and the route-required flag was not set, it sets its route-required flag and rebroadcasts the QRY message.
A node receiving an update packet updates the height value of its neighbour in the table and takes one of the following actions:
* If the reflection bit of the neighbours height is not set and its route required flag is set it sets its height for the destination to that of its neighbours but increments d by one. It then deletes the RR flag and sends an UPD message to the neighbours, so they may route through it.
* If the neighbours route is not valid (which is indicated by the reflection bit) or the RR flag was unset, the node only updates the entry of the neighbours node in its table.
Each node maintains a neighbour table containing the height of the neighbour nodes. Initially the height of all the nodes is NULL. (This is not zero &quot;0&quot; but NULL &quot;-&quot;) so their quintuple is (-,-,-,-,i). The height of a destination neighbour is (0,0,0,0,dest).
Node C requires a route, so it broadcasts a QRY.
The QRY propagates until it hits a node which has a route to the destination, this node then sends an UPD message.
The UPD is also propagated, while node E sends a new UPD.

===Route Maintenance===
Route maintenance in TORA has five different cases according to the flowchart below as an example:

&quot;Partition Detection and Route Erasure&quot;

# The links between Nodes D-F and E-F reverse.
# Node D propagates the reference level.
# Node E &quot;reflects&quot; the reference level. The reference heights of the neighbors are equal, with the reflection bit not set. E sets the reflection bit to indicate the reflection and sets its offset to 0.
# Node C propagates the new reference level.
# Node A propagates the reference level.

===Route Erasure===

When a node has detected a partition it sets its height and the heights of all its neighbours for the destination in its table to NULL and it issues a CLR (Clear) packet. The CLR packet consists of the reflected reference level (t,oid,1) and the destination id.

If a node receives a CLR packet and the reference level matches its own reference level it sets all heights of the neighbours and its own for the destination to NULL and broadcasts the CLR packet. If the reference level doesn&#x27;t match its own it just sets the heights of the neighbours its table matching the reflected reference level to NULL and updates their link status.

<text>The Apple Cinema Display is a line of flat-panel computer monitors developed and sold by Apple Inc. between 1999 and 2011. It was initially sold alongside the older line of Studio Displays, but eventually replaced them. Apple offered 20, 22, 23, 24, 27, and 30-inch sizes, with the last model being a 27-inch size with LED backlighting.

The Cinema Display line had three distinct design languages during its lifetime, the first featuring transparent polycarbonate plastic, and the later two featuring anodized aluminum. The first displays were designed to match the colorful plastic of the Power Mac G3 and later the Power Mac G4, while the second revisions were designed to match the aluminum aesthetics of the Power Mac G5 and PowerBook G4. The last available design matched the unibody laptops released in October 2008, and had a glossy screen.

The Apple Cinema Display name was retired in July 2011 with the introduction of the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Cinema Display models were no longer offered on the Apple Store website as of August 2014.

== Models ==
=== Cinema Display ===
The first model—the 22-inch Apple Cinema Display—was introduced in September 1999 alongside the Power Mac G4 and used DVI for video input. It was enclosed in a high-density plastic frame with an easel-style stand and had a display resolution of 1600×1024. 

The 22-inch model was upgraded in July 2000 with the Apple Display Connector (ADC), which ran DVI, USB, and 28V power through a single connector. It did not require an external power brick when it was connected to a computer with an ADC port on it.

It was eventually replaced by a 20-inch model on January 28, 2003, that also used an ADC connector and sported a widescreen display with up to 1680×1050 resolution and a brightness of 230 cd/m2.

The 20-inch Cinema Display was updated again June 28, 2004 to match the aluminum design of the new Cinema HD Display. It retained the 1680x1050 resolution of the previous model but saw its brightness increased to 250 cd/m2, and was introduced at a $1,299 price point. Apple continued to sell this display with no further changes until October 2008.

=== Cinema HD Display ===
The 23-inch model, dubbed the &quot;Cinema HD Display,&quot; was introduced on March 20, 2002, and supported full 1:1 1080p playback on a 1920x1200 pixel display.

On June 28, 2004, Apple introduced a redesigned line of Cinema Displays, along with a new 30-inch model that, like the 23-inch model, carried the &quot;Cinema HD Display&quot; name. The new models had an anodized aluminum enclosure that matched Apple&#x27;s high-end lines of professional products. An alternative stand or a wall mount could be used with a VESA mount adapter kit that was sold separately. Though the display enclosures had not been redesigned for a long period of time, several &quot;silent&quot; improvements were made to the brightness levels and contrast ratios.

==== 30-inch model compatibility ====
Due to the high resolution (2560×1600), the 30-inch model requires a graphics card that supports dual-link DVI. When the monitor was released, no Macintosh models were sold with a dual-link DVI port. A Power Mac G5 with the new Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra DDL graphics card was initially required to run the display at full resolution.

All Power Mac G5, PowerBook G4, and Mac Pro mid 2006 to mid 2010 models are capable of supporting it without the use of any adapters. Discrete MacBook Pros are also capable of driving the 30-inch display, while all Macs released after October 2008 require an additional adapter. The 30-inch Cinema Display was introduced together with the GeForce 6800, which supports two DVI-DL ports. ATI&#x27;s aftermarket AGP X800 Mac Edition also supports dual-link DVI, but has only one port. The Radeon 9600 Mac/PC was another aftermarket graphics card that supported dual-link DVI and was also compatible with older AGP-based Power Macs.

If a computer with a single-link DVI port (such as a Mac laptop with a mini-DVI connector) is connected to the 30-inch display, it will only run at 1280×800, even if the computer is capable of supporting 1920×1200 over a single-link connection.

=== LED Cinema Display ===

On October 14, 2008, the 20-inch Cinema Display and the 23-inch Cinema HD Display were discontinued and replaced with the 24-inch LED Cinema Display. Its chassis is made with aluminum and glass, reflecting the appearances of the current iMac, unibody MacBook Pro, and unibody MacBook designs. The display features a built-in iSight camera, microphone and dual speaker system. A MagSafe cable runs from the back of the display and provides 85W of charging for MacBooks. It is the first Cinema Display to use LED backlighting and Mini DisplayPort for video input; however, the LED backlighting is edge-lit as opposed to the fully back-lit CCFL of the previous models, resulting in a lower brightness cd/m2 output.

The 24-inch LED Cinema Display is only officially compatible with Macs that have a Mini DisplayPort port. A third-party converter must be used in order to use the display with older Macs.

Newer MacBooks that only have USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3) ports can connect to the 24-inch LED Cinema Display using a USB-C to Mini DisplayPort adapter. However, Apple&#x27;s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter cannot be used even though it has the same physical connections. Due to differences in the electrical signaling of Thunderbolt 2 and Mini DisplayPort, a generic USB-C to Mini DisplayPort adapter must be used instead.

With the introduction of LED panels, the matte, anti-glare screen panels were retired, except for the 30-inch Cinema Display. Apple had already moved away from matte screens in its line of iMac desktop computers on August 7, 2007. Apple had not offered any equipment with a matte, anti-glare screen after the 15-inch non-Retina MacBook Pro was discontinued in October 2013 until the introduction of the Pro Display XDR in 2019. This had been a cause for concern among users who wanted matte screens for their area of work, particularly graphic designers, photographers and users who extensively view their screens. Matte screens, like matte-surface photographs, diffuse reflected light and cannot provide the same black levels as glossy screens, which are required for working with HDR images and videos and thus are disadvantaged in this area. However, the matte screens have a far lower level of reflectivity, which improves ease-of-use.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; referred to Apple&#x27;s removal of the matte screen as one of their worst design decisions.

On July 26, 2010, the 24-inch LED Cinema Display and the 30-inch Cinema HD Display were replaced by a 27-inch model that supports up to 2560×1440 resolution. This model was sold for $999.

On July 20, 2011, the LED Cinema Display was discontinued and replaced by the Apple Thunderbolt Display.

== Technical specifications ==

=== LCD models ===
* On August 7, 2006 the Aluminium Cinema displays had a silent upgrade that boosted the brightness and contrast ratios to 300/400 cd/m2 and 700:1. The last Cinema displays are still desirable to professionals being the last anti-glare displays made by Apple (until the Pro Display XDR) and having a true IPS 8-bit (no dithering) fully back-lit panel and slightly higher brightness than that of the newer Apple Thunderbolt displays, which have a reflective glossy screen and an edge-lit panel. These displays (including the LED Cinema 24”) are the last Apple desktop monitors made in 16:10 aspect ratio that is also used on MacBook Pros and provides more vertical work space.

<doc id="1126609" wikidata="Q1928341" url="?curid=1126609" title="Michael Kurland">
<text>Michael Joseph Kurland (born March 1, 1938) is an American author, best known for his works of science fiction and detective fiction. Kurland lives in San Luis Obispo, California.

==Writing career==
Kurland&#x27;s early career was devoted to works of science fiction. His first published novel was &quot;Ten Years to Doomsday&quot; (written with Chester Anderson) in 1964. Other notable works include &quot;Tomorrow Knight&quot;, &quot;Pluribus&quot;, &quot;Perchance&quot;, and &quot;The Unicorn Girl&quot;. &quot;The Unicorn Girl&quot; was the middle volume of the Greenwich Village Trilogy by three different authors, the other two being Chester Anderson and T.A. Waters. (Anderson&#x27;s book, &quot;The Butterfly Kid&quot;, was nominated for a Hugo Award.) 
Kurland has also written two novels, &quot;Ten Little Wizards&quot; and &quot;A Study in Sorcery&quot;, set in the world of Randall Garrett&#x27;s Lord Darcy, prefiguring his later success as a mystery writer.

Following the success of &quot;The Infernal Device&quot;, which was nominated for an Edgar Award (as was his earlier &quot;A Plague of Spies&quot;), Kurland turned his attention to detective fiction. Several of his subsequent novels have been sequels to &quot;The Infernal Device&quot;, and feature Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s nemesis, Professor Moriarty. In this series, Professor Moriarty is an antihero (and sometimes a real hero) who resignedly tolerates Holmes&#x27;s obsessively exaggerated opinion of his criminal empire, and is often brought into reluctant alliance with his nemesis in order to counter menaces ranging from threats to their associates to threats to the nation.

He has edited three themed anthologies of Sherlock Holmes short stories, &quot;My Sherlock Holmes&quot; (stories narrated by characters other than Watson or Holmes), &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Hidden Years&quot; (stories set during the period in which Holmes was supposed to be dead) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes: the American Years&quot; (stories set in the time between Holmes&#x27; graduation from university and his meeting Dr. Watson).

He is also the author of numerous non-fiction works, including &quot;How to Solve a Murder: the Forensic Handbook&quot; and &quot;How to Try a Murder: the Handbook for Armchair Lawyers&quot;.

<text>Assab or Aseb (, ) is a port city in the Southern Red Sea Region of Eritrea. It is situated on the west coast of the Red Sea.
Languages spoken in Assab are predominantly Afar, Tigrinya, and Arabic. After the Italian government took control of the port in 1882, it laid the foundations for the formation of the colony of Italian Eritrea, which became the independent country of Eritrea following its independence from Ethiopia in the 1990s.
==History==
Assab is about northwest of the ancient city of Arsinoe Epidires.

===19th century===
Assab had limited contact with the hinterland, and until the middle of the 19th century it was nothing more than a tiny Afar fishing village with a population of only 100 people and twenty huts. It gained considerable attention on 15 November 1869 when the port of Assab was bought by the Italian missionary Giuseppe Sapeto on behalf of the Rubattino Shipping Company. Upon reaching Assab, Sapeto found two sultans, the brothers Hasan ibn Ahmed and Ibrahim ibn Ahmed, who were both willing to sell the port for 6,000 Maria Theresa dollars. Sapeto justified his purchase by claiming that the port was ideally situated for Italy due to its proximity to the Bab-el-Mandeb and he also argued that the port, though nominally under the control of the sultan of Aussa, was in fact its own independent polity. Nevertheless, the purchase received considerable controversy in Italy where it was opposed by both the press and the parliament but also attracted strong condemnation by the Egyptians who declared the sale to be illegal.

The Italian government, impressed by the possibility of developing the port for access to Ethiopia further inland, seized control of the area in 1882 and took steps to open up the route inland to Shewa. Count , the Italian envoy to Menelik II, signed a contract with the Ethiopian ruler, agreeing to supply him with 2,000 Remington rifles which were imported via Assab. Antonelli also visited Aussa in 1883 where he was able to befriend the Afar sultan, Muhammad Hanfari and he convinced him to sign a treaty of commerce with the Italian government. As a result, the trade between Assab and Shewa soon expanded and by the end of the following year Antonelli was able to bring in 50,000 rifles and 10 million cartridges in exchange for 600 camels bearing gold, ivory and civet.

In 1884, the port was visited by the Italian traveler G.B Licata who estimated the population to be 111 Afars, 140 Arabs, 43 Italians, 12 Abyssinians and 10 Somalis. Despite still being a small settlement, Assab was regarded as a place of promise, Licata described it emotionally in 1884 as the beginning of &quot;great things to come. Beautiful for what it will be when Italy will have made it in truth a colony; it is pleasing in fact because it is a young thing, and touching as an Italian thing.&quot;

Following the occupation of Massawa in 1885, the settlement inevitably declined. The occupation of the more northernly town provided the Italians with a much larger port that gave them easier access to Ethiopia. The port&#x27;s firearm trade with Shewa also broke down due to the outbreak of hostilities with Menelik II. After the disastrous Battle of Adwa, Assab was largely forgotten and the Italians concentrated their interest on Massawa.

===20th century===
By the early years of the 20th century, the port of Assab had been rendered redundant. Ethiopia, suspicious of Italy, preferred to do business with the French at Djibouti. The completion of the Ethio-Djibouti Railways led to further decline in trade passing through Assab. In the absence of any significant trade from the inland, the settlement depended on salt production which was exported to Japan, as well as some nearby date plantations. The population during this time period was estimated to be between 1,000 and 3,000 inhabitants with 100 to 140 Italians.

A 1922 British War Office report stated that the settlement was no more than a small village and consisted of &quot;less than a hundred round grass huts of the native population with a few European built houses and a modest custom house&quot;. The rise of fascism seems to have made an impression as the British traveller Hermann Norden observes &quot;even without a sight of the flag from the Government buildings the traveller would know he was in an Italian possession, for the black children in the winding lanes give the fascist salute&quot;.

After the Second Italo-Ethiopian War the development of Assab was given a new impetus by the building of a road to Dessie and the reconstruction of the port. Assab was one of the last Italian holdouts to surrender to the Allies during the East African Campaign. Assab was captured on 11 June 1941 by the 3/15th Punjab Regiment, which captured its entire garrison including its commander, Pietro Piacentini.

After Eritrea&#x27;s federation with Ethiopia in 1952 (and incorporation in 1962), Assab became an important port of entry for the southern and central parts of the country. Assab was further expanded by construction work, with aid from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia during the reign of Haile Selassie I. Construction of an oil refinery began in 1964 and it opened in 1967. This development motivated a large number of Ethiopian immigrants from Tigray and Wollo, to seek jobs as dock workers or work in the salt and fishing industries. The Derg military regime was eager to detach Assab from the rest of Eritrea administratively, espesically as nationalist sentiments among the Afar began to grow in the 1970s. Ethiopian trade in Assab increased to over 60% as war in other parts of Eritrea made other ports unsuitable. By 1989, Assab had a population of 39,600 inhabitants. The oil refinery was shut down for economic reasons in 1997. Ethiopia used Assab as the port for two-thirds of its trade with the world until the Eritrean–Ethiopian War broke out in 1998. Borders between Eritrea and Ethiopia closed and trade with Ethiopia ceased. The port and the port town declined and by 2005 the population had dropped to an estimated 20,222 inhabitants.

===21st century===
In 2008, following a border dispute with neighbouring Djibouti and consequently an unsafe border between the countries, which saw forces from Qatar acting as mediators in a buffer zone, the role of Assab diminished further.

During the Tigray War, the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) accused Ethiopia of deploying drones from a military base in Assab belonging to the United Arab Emirates.

==Infrastructure==
Assab is served by Assab International Airport. The United Arab Emirates reportedly uses the port and airport for logistics, and as a detention centre.

==Climate==
Assab has the typical hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) of the Danakil Region. The city&#x27;s climate is arid and extremely hot, with an extremely low average annual rainfall of . Assab experiences high temperatures during both the day and the night, with the annual mean average temperature approaching .

<text>The Jadoon, also known as Gadoon or Jadun (; Hindko: جدون) is a Pashtun tribe primarily residing in the Hazara and Kohistan regions as well as in the Swabi district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Some members of the tribe also live in Nangarhar and Kunar in Afghanistan. 

==History==
A small section of the Jadoon tribeusing the ethnonym &quot;Gadun&quot;speaks Pashto but rest of the tribe in the Hazara region has been assimilated into the Hindkowan Hazarewal community and speaks Hindko. Sir Olaf Caroe, a British Raj-era administrator of NWFP, counts Jadoon tribe under Panni sub-division in the genealogy of the Gharghasht in his book &quot;The Pathans&quot;. According to the historian I︠U︡riĭ Vladimirovich Gankovskiĭ (Yuri V. Gankovsky), professor of Pakistan Studies at Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, the Jadoons were a tribe of Indo-Aryan origin that were assimilated by the Kakar.

==Genetics==

Y haplogroup and mtdna haplogroup samples were taken from Jadoon, Yousafzai, Sayyid, Gujaran and Tanoli men living in Swabi District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Jadoon men have predominantly East Asian origin paternal ancestry with West Eurasian maternal ancestry and a lesser amount of South Asian maternal ancestry according to a Y and mtdna haplogroup test indicating local females marrying immigrant males during the medieval period. Y Haplogroup O3-M122 makes up the majority of Jadoon men, the same haplogroup carried by the majority (50-60%) of Han Chinese. 82.5% of Jadoon men carrying Q-MEH2 and O3-M122 which are both of East Asian origin. O3-M122 was absent in the Sayyid (Syed) population and appeared in low numbers among Tanolis, Gujars and Yousafzais. There appears to be founder affect in the O3-M122 among the Jadoon. 76.32% of Jadoon men carry O3-M122 while 0.75% of Tanolis, 0.81% of Gujars and 2.82% of Yousafzais carry O3-M122.

56.25% of Jadoons in another test carried West Eurasian maternal Haplogroup H (mtDNA). Dental morphology of the Swabi Jadoons was also analyzed and compared to other groups in the regions like Yousufzais and Sayyids.

<text>USS &quot;Blenny&quot; (SS/AGSS-324), a submarine in commission from 1944 to 1969, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the blenny, a fish found along the rocky shores of the Atlantic Ocean. During World War II, &quot;Blenny&quot; conducted four war patrols in the Java Sea and South China Sea between 10 November 1944 and 14 August 1945 . She sank eight Japanese vessels totaling 18,262 tons. In addition, she is credited with destroying more than 62 miscellaneous Japanese small craft by gunfire.

After World War II, &quot;Blenny&quot; served in the United States Pacific Fleet along the United States West Coast. She also visited Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Japan and China and conducted a war patrol during the Korean War. She later transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet and served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. She was scuttled as part of an artificial reef in 1989.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Blenny&quot; (SS-324) was laid down on 8 July 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 9 April 1944, sponsored by Miss Florence King, daughter of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest J. King, and commissioned on 27 June 1944 with Lieutenant Commander William H. Hazzard in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

====July–October 1944====
Following training at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton and at Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Blenny&quot; got underway for Key West, Florida, on 29 August 1944. She arrived at Key West on 5 September 1944 and trained at the Fleet Sound School there. She then headed for the Panama Canal, transiting it on 19 September 1944, and departed Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 28 September 1944. She reached Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 15 October 1944.

====First war patrol====
On 10 November 1944, &quot;Blenny&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor to begin her first war patrol. After fueling at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 22 November 1944, she departed on 23 November bound for a patrol area off the coast of Luzon in the Philippine Islands. On 1 December 1944, she fired a single torpedo at a Japanese escort vessel but missed. The Japanese retaliated with a severe, but unsuccessful, depth-charge attack. On 6 December, she escaped unscathed from another close call when a low-flying Japanese plane dropped two bombs that near-missed &quot;Blenny&quot;.

On 14 December 1944, &quot;Blenny&quot; claimed her first two successes. In the morning, she made a surface gun attack on a Japanese 300-gross register ton &quot;sea truck&quot; — the U.S. term for a type of small cargo ship — and sank it. Late that night, she sank the 800-displacement ton frigate &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 28&quot; with torpedoes in a surface attack. On 23 December, &quot;Blenny&quot; torpedoed and sank what she thought was a 10,000-ton transport which after the war was identified as the Japanese 4,156-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Kenzui Maru&quot;. Her parting shot of the patrol came on 27 December 1944 when she fired torpedoes at an unidentified cargo ship and claimed to have damaged her, although Japanese records did not substantiate the claim. &quot;Blenny&quot; set course for Fremantle, Australia on 31 December 1944 and arrived there on 13 January 1945 to begin a refit, concluding her patrol.

====Second war patrol====
&quot;Blenny&quot; departed Fremantle to embark upon her second war patrol on 5 February 1945. This time her patrol area was in the South China Sea off the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina. On 20 February, she made an unsuccessful submerged attack on a Japanese convoy escorted by two destroyers. The attack did not succeed, and she suffered through a series of depth-charge attacks from the convoy&#x27;s escorts which also proved unsuccessful. On the night of 26 February 1945, she encountered the Japanese 10,238-gross register ton tanker &quot;Amato Maru&quot; and sank her with a spread of torpedoes. Though &quot;Blenny&quot; also claimed to have damaged two similar ships, a postwar check of Japanese records failed to corroborate that claim.

On 28 February 1945, &quot;Blenny&quot; received orders to put into Subic Bay on Luzon to reload torpedoes, and she arrived there on 2 March. She returned to her patrol area on 4 March. Sixteen days later, she had her most successful day of the war on 20 March 1945 when she sank three Japanese ships in one 24-hour period: the 500-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Yamakuni Maru&quot;, the 834-gross register ton &quot;No. 21 Nanahin Maru&quot;, and the 1,039-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Hosen Maru&quot;. After receiving two rescued aircrewmen from the submarine on 25 March 1945, she set a course for Subic Bay and a refit.

====Third war patrol====
On 16 April 1945, &quot;Blenny&quot; put to sea for her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the South China Sea off French Indochina in which she was to perform lifeguard duty to rescue ditched United States Army Air Forces aircrews. She sighted no Japanese ships during her time in the South China Sea and returned to Subic Bay on 16 May 1945 to take on additional fuel. On 18 May she returned to sea to resume her patrol and shaped a course for a new patrol area in the Java Sea.

On 25 May 1945, &quot;Blenny&quot; encountered a small Japanese submarine chaser close inshore. She had to make her approach to an attack position in relatively shallow water, so she flooded down and backed awash toward the shore and the submarine chaser while a sailor on her fantail took depth soundings with a lead line. She fired torpedoes from her stern torpedo tubes and claimed to have sunk the submarine chaser, although she estimated the submarine chaser to be of only 170 tons displacement and the postwar survey counted only vessels of 500 tons or more, making her claim impossible to verify.

On 30 May 1945, &quot;Blenny&quot; sank a small lugger with gunfire, then encountered the Japanese 520-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Hokoku Maru&quot; and sank her in a daylight attack. On 5 June 1945, she departed the Java area and set a course for Fremantle, Australia. She arrived at Fremantle on 9 June 1945 and commenced a refit.

====Fourth war patrol====
&quot;Blenny&quot; embarked upon her fourth war patrol on 5 July 1945. Departing Fremantle, she shaped a course for a patrol area in the Java Sea and north from there to the eastern coast of Japanese-occupied British Malaya. On 11 July 1945 she made her first kill of the patrol by sinking a &quot;sea truck&quot; by gunfire. On 16 July she torpedoed and sank the converted Japanese gunboat in the Java Sea west of Surabaya, Java, at . She then engaged a small vessel that had been in company with &quot;Nankai&quot;, but her gunfire failed to inflict much damage on the vessel because of extreme range and &quot;Blenny&quot;′s inability to close with the vessel.

For the remainder of the patrol, &quot;Blenny&quot; encountered only sampans, junks, and the like, sinking a large number of them after ascertaining their nationality and seeing to the safety of their crews. On 3 August 1945, she stopped a sampan and rescued from it a boarding party of U.S. sailors from the submarine which &quot;Cod&quot; had been forced to abandon two days earlier when she crash-dived to avoid being strafed by an approaching Japanese plane. On 7 August, a Japanese plane attacked &quot;Blenny&quot;, dropping a small bomb which missed, and &quot;Blenny&quot; dove to evade.

On 11 August 1945, &quot;Blenny&quot; left her patrol area and shaped a course for Subic Bay, which she reached on 14 August 1945, concluding her patrol. On 15 August 1945, World War II came to an end with the cessation of hostilities with Japan.

===Post-World War II===
====1945–1954====
After completing a refit, &quot;Blenny&quot; departed Subic Bay on 31 August 1945. She arrived at Guam in the Mariana Islands on 5 September 1945 and began a series of training exercises. She remained in the Marianas until 12 January 1946, when she got underway for the United States. She made a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Diego, California, on 30 January 1946. She stayed there for two months before shifting to San Francisco, California, on 30 March 1946. During the summer of 1946, she operated along the United States West Coast.

On 2 August 1946, &quot;Blenny&quot; departed San Diego and headed, via Pearl Harbor, for the Far East. She arrived at Subic Bay late in August 1946 and remained there until 2 September, at which time she got underway for Tsingtao, China. She served in Chinese waters, at Tsingtao and Shanghai, until late October 1946. After operations in Japanese waters which lasted until 3 November 1946, she set a course for San Diego, which she reached in late November 1946.

&quot;Blenny&quot; remained at San Diego until 17 February 1947, when she got underway for Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 March 1947 and stayed until 18 March, when she headed back to San Diego. She arrived at San Diego on 8 April 1947 and then operated along the coast of California through the end of July. On 30 July 1947, she got underway from San Diego on a United States Naval Reserve training cruise to the Pacific Northwest, during which she visited ports in Washington and British Columbia in Canada. She resumed operations along the coast of California late in August 1947. She made two winter cruises in Alaskan waters in 1947–1948 and 1948–1949 and made a midshipman cruise to Canada. In July 1950, she began a voyage to Pearl Harbor, then, after participating in fleet maneuvers off Hawaii, returned to San Diego early in August 1950. When not otherwise engaged, &quot;Blenny&quot; conducted operations along the U.S. West Coast during these years.

In 1951, &quot;Blenny&quot; underwent conversion under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) Program to a GUPPY IA. After its completion, she operated along the U.S. West Coast until 30 April 1952, when she got underway for Pearl Harbor, then continued across the Pacific for a cruise in the Far East, arriving in Yokosuka, Japan, on 24 May 1952. While in the Far East, &quot;Blenny&quot; conducted routine United States Seventh Fleet operations and made a 35-day reconnaissance war patrol off the Korean Peninsula during the Korean War. She departed Yokosuka to return to the United States on 18 October 1952. After stops at Chichi Jima in the Volcano Islands and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Diego early in November 1952.

&quot;Blenny&quot; resumed operations along the U.S. West Coast until she was reassigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet in the spring of 1954. On 11 May 1954 she stood out of San Diego and shaped a course for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 24 May 1954 and headed for Naval Submarine Base New London at Groton, Connecticut, which she reached on 9 June 1954.

====1954–1969====

Operating from Naval Submarine Base New London, &quot;Blenny&quot; participated from 1954 until the early 1960s in U.S. Atlantic Fleet, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and antisubmarine warfare exercises, in addition to operating with a U.S. Navy submarine development group engaged in evaluating new equipment. Her primary mission was the development of attack submarine tactics and antisubmarine warfare tactics, but she also test-fired new types of torpedoes. During these years, her operations took her as far south as the British West Indies and as far north as the coast of Newfoundland.

In the early 1960s, &quot;Blenny&quot; began making periodic deployments to the Mediterranean Sea for duty with the United States Sixth Fleet, alternating between tours of duty with the Sixth Fleet and extended assignments in the western Atlantic Ocean, where she conducted test and evaluation operations and took part in antisubmarine warfare training. Sometime in 1969, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-324.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In September 1969, &quot;Blenny&quot; was placed in commission, in reserve. She was decommissioned on 7 November 1969 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, berthed initially at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1973.

&quot;Blenny&quot; subsequently was moved to Portsmouth, Virginia. She remained there until 3 July 1979, when she was moved to Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia. Plans made in 1984 to sink her as a target during an exercise were cancelled. Instead a decision was made in 1987 to donate her to the State of Maryland for use as an artificial reef. She was scuttled on 7 June 1989 to form part of an artificial reef in the Atlantic Ocean about off Ocean City, Maryland.

<text>Benguela (; Umbundu: Luombaka) is a city in western Angola, capital of Benguela Province. Benguela is one of Angola&#x27;s most populous cities with a population of 555,124 in the city and 561,775 in the municipality, at the 2014 census.

==History==

===Portuguese rule===

Benguela was founded in 1617 as &quot;São Felipe de Benguela&quot; by the Portuguese under Manuel Cerveira Pereira, 8th Governor of Angola (1604–1607). 
It was long the centre of an important trade, especially in slaves to Brazil and Cuba. Ships anchored about off the shore, in depths of and transferred loads to smaller boats which used five or six jetties in the town. However, the nearby deep-water sheltered harbour of Lobito was a much larger port. 

Besides the churches of S. Felipe and S. António, the hospital, and the fortress, as of 1911 there were only a few stone-built houses. A short way beyond Benguela is Baía Farta, where salt was manufactured and sulphur was extracted. Close to Baia Farta was the beach of Baia Azul. The city prospered and grew in the following decades. 

The Benguela Railway was built in the early 20th century by Portugal to connect the city and Lobito to the interior, and it achieved great success when linked to the Copperbelt of Katanga, DR Congo and Zambia.

Starting in the early 20th century, Benguela attracted, developed, and retained quality businesses and professionals into its growing economy. Sisal and fishing industries expanded and the financial, construction and services market boomed until 1974.

===Post-independence===
In 1975, after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, Portugal, the Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola became independent. 

Due to the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), which lasted more than 20 years after independence from Portugal, the important Benguela railway line closed, with only the short distance of between Benguela and Lobito remaining operational. 
In 1983 Benguela had a population of 155,000. During the civil war the city of Benguela increased its population due to refugees from the countryside.
===21st century===
In the mid-2000s, with a more peaceful environment, restoration of the railway between Benguela and Huambo commenced.

While the colonial part of the city consists of relatively good-quality houses, as of 2011 most of the refugees live in slum areas.

==Transports==
The city has an airport, the Benguela Airport.
The city is connected to the railway with the Benguela Railway.

==Economy==

Benguela was one of the centres of Portuguese trade to the African interior. The city remains an important commercial link between western and eastern Angola. Coffee, corn, sisal, sugarcane, and tobacco are grown in the interior regions of Angola and widely traded in Benguela. 

Manganese from the interior is also traded in Benguela. Industries local to the city include fish processing and the milling of sugarcane. The city also produces pottery, soap, and tools.

Foreign trade is handled through the deep-water port of Lobito, which is located north of Benguela. Lobito, once the busiest port in Angola, was severely disrupted during the Angolan Civil War. The port has since revived and supports trade in the Benguela region.

== Education ==

The &quot;Universidade Katyavala Bwila and Ruvandro Ferreira&quot; was founded in 2009.

== Culture ==
===Religion=== 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : 
*Roman Catholic Diocese of Benguela (Catholic Church)
*Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola (World Communion of Reformed Churches)
*Evangelical Reformed Church in Angola (World Communion of Reformed Churches)
*Baptist Convention of Angola (Baptist World Alliance)
*Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assemblies of God.

<doc id="1126621" wikidata="Q1024460" url="?curid=1126621" title="C.S. Cartaginés">
<text>Club Sport Cartaginés Deportiva S.A., also known as Cartaginés, is a Costa Rican football club, that currently plays in the Liga de Fútbol de Primera División, the top division of Costa Rican football league system. Cartaginés&#x27; home venue is Estadio Jose Rafael Fello Meza, located in Barrio Asis of Cartago.

Established in 1906, Cartaginés is currently the oldest club competing at the top division. It has won 4 Costa Rican league championships, 5 national cups, 1 national Supercup, and 1 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (in 1994).

==History==
Club Sport Cartaginés was founded on July 1, 1906, by Willie Pirie, a Canadian immigrant, together with a group of Costa Ricans of British descent and some England immigrants that lived in Cartago. Since there were few football teams at the time in the country, games were repeatedly held against teams in Cartago such as Combate and Monte Libano. The team&#x27;s original uniform colors were red and blue. Club Sport Cartaginés&#x27; first official match was seen as a local social event as the municipal Philharmonic played prior to the game.

In 1914, Club Sport Cartaginés got into the Costa Rican football scene with a new name: &quot;The Americano&quot;. The name Americano lasted until 1921 when Costa Rica&#x27;s Primera División started its national championship. At that time, Americano reverted to its original name of Club Sport Cartaginés and changed their uniform and colors to vertical white and blue stripes, a scheme that still prevails today. The 1923 National Championship Final saw Club Sport Cartaginés face La Libertad, a match that Cartaginés won by a score of two to one giving the club its first of three national titles.

After the seasons many of Cartaginés&#x27; players left the team to play in Europe and in teams based in San José. Due to the mass exodus of players from the team Club Sport Cartaginés disbanded in 1925. By 1934 the popularity of football in Cartago reemerged as a tournament of local Cartago teams participated. After the tournament it was decided to form Club Sport Cartaginés once again with the best players that participated in the tournament and to emerge as a third division team winning the third division title in 1935. In 1936 the team managed to be victorious in the Second Division, winning all of its games and being crowned the champions, thus earning them a spot in the top flight.

In their returning season to the First Division, Club Sport Cartaginés once again made it to the Final, and once again facing La Libertad, defeating them by a score of 1-0 and achieving the status of national champions in Costa Rica&#x27;s national stadium in San Jose. By 1940 Cartaginés only had three players left from its 1936 championship season, but they still managed to make it to the final against heavily favorites Herediano. At half time the score was in favor of the latter as they led 3–1, but Cartaginés fought back in the second half, scoring three goals and beating Herediano by a score of 4–3.

The 1940 Cartaginés team was the last one to win any national league championship for Cartago for the next 81 years, something which a local myth states to be the result of a curse set that year on the team by a priest at the highly revered temple Basílica de Los Ángeles, when the players celebrated their victory by storming the Basilica riding on top of their horses, which was considered sacrilegious. Another myth credits the lack of titles to the curse of &quot;El Muñeco&quot;, a strange voodoo-like doll that was supposedly buried under Cartaginés&#x27; turf at their stadium in order to prevent them from winning further titles and bringing bad luck to the club. 

In the years following the 1940 Championship, the club discovered their currently considered greatest player, José Rafael &quot;Fello&quot; Meza Ivancovich. Within a few years, Jose Rafael became known as &quot;El Maestro&quot;, the teacher. He was named so because his new tricks and ways of playing, innovative at the time. The influence of &quot;Fello&quot; Meza was so deep, that the club&#x27;s current stadium is named in his honor. Also, in 2009 he was included in UNAFUT&#x27;s (governing body of Costa Rican football clubs) official list of Costa Rica&#x27;s 100 best players of the 20th century.

In 1966 Cartaginés was the first Costa Rican club to travel to the United States playing against Guadalajara and Emelec. During those years the club assembled one of its most famous squads, called the &quot;Ballet Azul&quot; (Blue Ballet, because their graceful style of play), trained by coach Alfredo &quot;Chato&quot; Piedra, and spearheaded by their current historical top scorer, Leonel Hernández (164 goals), which stayed in the club during his entire career. As a recognition for Hernández for his loyalty, the club retired his jersey number, 11.

Cartaginés struggled during the 80s, a low point being the relegation in 1982 to the second division, which forced a club rebuilding in order to obtain a spot in Costa Rica&#x27;s Primera División. A breakthrough came for Cartaginés when in 1983 they won the &quot;Segunda&quot; championship, and returned to the top flight, in which has remained since then. In 1987 they lost the championship final to Herediano.

In the 90s, the club was unable to break Saprissa and Alajuelense&#x27;s hold on the top position, finishing runners-up in 1993 and 1996. The former season, however, allowed them to participate and win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 1994, their current biggest achievement, defeating Mexican club Atlante 3–2 in the final.

In the 21st century, the club tried to push for the championship during the 2000s and 2010s decades, with a runners-up position in the 2012-2013 season their best league result. However, they won the 2014 and 2015 editions of the Costa Rican Cup, the national knockout football competition. Their most decorated player of this period was Randall Brenes, known as &quot;Chiqui&quot;, which in 2017 became the second striker of the club (after Leonel Hernández) to reach the 100 league goals cap, and retired with a total of 103 in 280 appearances.

The long wait for the national title was over for the 2021-2022 season, when Cartaginés defeated Liga Deportiva Alajuelense (2–1 aggregate) in the Clausura final to win their 4th league championship. Those days Cartago was filled with people celebrating with bugles and flags that finally, after 81 years, they had won the tournament. They also won that year the Costa Rican Cup for the third consecutive time, defeating Herediano in the final (3–2 aggregate).

<doc id="1126627" wikidata="Q69869" url="?curid=1126627" title="2004 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 58th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It was the 55th FIA Formula One World Championship, and was contested over eighteen races from 7 March to 24 October 2004.

The championship was dominated by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, with Schumacher winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the seventh and final time. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello finished the championship in second with Jenson Button coming in third for BAR. Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship for a record 14th time ahead of BAR and Renault.

In this championship, several records were broken. Michael Schumacher won 13 races, breaking his record of 11 race wins in one season from . He also broke the record for most consecutive World Drivers&#x27; titles (5) and Ferrari broke the record for most consecutive Constructors&#x27; titles (6).

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.
† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

Four of the ten teams, Ferrari, Renault, Jaguar, and Toyota, were subsidiaries of major car companies. However, BAR was a division of British American Tobacco. Williams and McLaren, both privately owned teams, had engine supply agreements with BMW and Mercedes-Benz respectively, and Honda produced engines for BAR.

The other three teams, Jordan, Sauber and Minardi, were also privately owned but received little substantial sponsorship and consequently tended to end up toward the back of the grid. Sauber received Ferrari engines badged under the Petronas name and received sponsorship from the Malaysian oil and gas company.

===Free practice drivers===
Five constructors entered free practice only drivers over the course of the season.
 – Leinders was entered as third driver for Round 1 but was refused a FIA Super Licence until he completed the required mileage in a Formula One car. He satisfied this requirement before the next race.

===Driver changes===
* The 2004 season featured several driver line-up changes prior to the season, and more changes during the season proper. Minardi, Jordan, and Sauber started 2004 with completely new driver line-ups.
* At BAR, following Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s departure from the team before the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix, former test driver Takuma Sato was permanently given the second race seat alongside Jenson Button; after serving in a temporary capacity during 2003, Anthony Davidson became the permanent test driver replacing Takuma Sato.
* At Minardi, Nicolas Kiesa was unable to keep his seat and was released. Jos Verstappen left Minardi as a result of sponsorship problems and an unwillingness to spend another year competing with other backmarkers in the non-competitive team. Gianmaria Bruni, who had performed a limited amount of testing in 2003, was signed to a full-time drive. Zsolt Baumgartner was confirmed as the second full-time driver after the Hungarian government provided sponsorship; Baumgartner had performed replacement duties at Jordan in 2003 after Ralph Firman suffered injuries from a crash in Hungary. Completing the all-new line-up, Bas Leinders and Tiago Monteiro were signed as test drivers for 2004. Leinders was signed from the ranks of the World Series by Nissan, while Monteiro was signed from the American Fittipaldi Champ Car team.
* Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Sauber mutually parted ways at the end of 2003. Frentzen then moved out of F1 and joined fellow ex-F1 drivers Mika Häkkinen and Jean Alesi in the DTM. Nick Heidfeld was also released by Sauber, and appeared to have no drive for 2004. However several successful test drives at Jordan landed him a seat there. Fisichella left Jordan after 2003 having signed a drive for Sauber. This meant that Heidfeld and Fisichella effectively swapped seats. Sauber&#x27;s other new driver was Felipe Massa, who left his test position at Ferrari and returned to the team where he had raced in 2002. As Sauber used Ferrari engines in 2003, Massa took considerable knowledge of Ferrari components with him.
* Choosing not to extend Justin Wilson&#x27;s contract, Jaguar signed Christian Klien to partner Mark Webber in the R5. Wilson turned down a test drive and departed Jaguar to join the Mi-Jack Conquest Racing team in Champ Car racing in America. Björn Wirdheim was signed as their Friday test driver. The other Friday test drivers are Franck Montagny, who was rewarded for a championship year in the World Series by Nissan with a permanent test drive at Renault, Ryan Briscoe, who joined Ricardo Zonta as a test driver at Toyota, and Pedro de la Rosa, who returned to F1 as a test driver for McLaren.

====Mid-season changes====
*Giorgio Pantano was replaced by Timo Glock at the . Pantano left Jordan after the , with Glock replacing him again for the remainder of the season.
*After Ralf Schumacher was injured during the , Marc Gené replaced him at the French and British Grands Prix. Antônio Pizzonia then replaced him from the to the . Schumacher returned for the .
*Cristiano da Matta was replaced by test driver Ricardo Zonta from the onward. Zonta was dropped by Toyota for the before replacing Olivier Panis at the , who stepped down from his race seat and retired from the sport.
*Jarno Trulli&#x27;s relationship with the Renault team deteriorated after his first victory at the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix. He left the team after the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, which was also Pantano&#x27;s last race for the Jordan team. Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve replaced Jarno Trulli at Renault for the final three races. Trulli missed the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix, but he returned in the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix and the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix with the Toyota team. That meant the 2004 Japanese Grand Prix was Jarno Trulli&#x27;s first race with the new team.

===Team changes===
* As part of a global restructuring and cost-cutting exercise, Ford announced during the season that they would not be entering into the F1 championship in 2005 via their Jaguar team. They also announced that their Cosworth motor and engineering divisions were being sold. The Jaguar team was eventually bought by Red Bull and continued to compete under the Red Bull Racing name in 2005.

== Regulation changes ==
From the 2004 season onward, all the teams that did not finish in the top four in the previous year&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship were allowed to run a third car in the Friday practice session before each Grand Prix, for testing purposes. While other teams were permitted to have test drivers, they were not allowed to compete in the Friday practice. Sauber chose not to run its third driver in these sessions because of the added expense.

The 2004 season also saw a change in technical regulations, including banning fully-automatic gearboxes and launch control, both of which had been used for the past three seasons. 2004 was the first time since the beginning of (pre-Spanish Grand Prix) that cars competed without these systems. However, the use of traction control was still permitted by the FIA, and continued to be allowed for use over the next three seasons, until it was banned for the 2008 season.

==Calendar==
The 2004 Formula One calendar featured two new events: the Bahrain Grand Prix and the Chinese Grand Prix, held at two newly built circuits in Sakhir and Shanghai. The season featured the most races outside Europe to that point; eight Grands Prix were held in the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. The Brazilian Grand Prix moved from its traditional early season slot to become the season finale, whereas the United States Grand Prix moved from its previous date in late September to late June as a back-to-back race with the Canadian Grand Prix.

The only exit was the Austrian Grand Prix, after seven years of racing at the A1-Ring, the modified circuit old Österreichring. The grandstands and pit buildings were demolished during the year, rendering the track unusable for any motorsport category. The circuit eventually reopened in 2011 as the Red Bull Ring and was later reinstated to the F1 calendar in 2014.

==Season report==

=== Opening rounds ===

Ferrari dominated the opening weekend at Albert Park in Australia, comfortably locking out the front row in qualifying and earning a 1–2 in the race. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on his way to a lights-to-flag victory, with teammate Rubens Barrichello and Renault&#x27;s Fernando Alonso joining him on the podium. Schumacher followed that up with another pole and victory at Sepang, finishing ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya and Jenson Button, the British driver scoring his first career podium and the BAR Honda team&#x27;s best result since the 2001 German Grand Prix. Mark Webber, who split the Ferraris in qualifying in his unfancied Jaguar, suffered a poor start before colliding with Ralf Schumacher and spinning out.

Formula One&#x27;s first visit to the Arab world since the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix took place at the Bahrain International Circuit. The Ferrari duo of Schumacher and Barrichello once again finished 1–2 in both qualifying and the race, with Button&#x27;s second consecutive podium elevating him to third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship as the series headed for Europe.

=== European rounds ===
Jenson Button scored his and BAR&#x27;s maiden pole at the San Marino Grand Prix, but Michael Schumacher overtook him on the eighth lap and finished nearly ten seconds ahead. Button and Juan Pablo Montoya completed the rostrum—the latter beating Fernando Alonso to the line by just two seconds—while Kimi Räikkönen recorded his first finish of the season in eighth, using a two-stop strategy to claim the final point from last on the grid. Despite suffering from a defective exhaust, Schumacher dominated the Spanish Grand Prix as well, as front-row starter Montoya retired with brake problems and early leader Jarno Trulli took third behind Rubens Barrichello.

At the Monaco Grand Prix, Trulli scored his first career victory from pole after surviving intense pressure from Jenson Button. Rubens Barrichello in third was the only other driver on the lead lap, albeit more than a minute behind the leaders. Teammate Schumacher was one of several front-runners who retired, the championship leader&#x27;s five-win streak ending after a collision with Juan Pablo Montoya under the safety car. That safety car period was necessitated by Fernando Alonso, who slammed the barrier on lap 42 while attempting to lap the Williams of Ralf Schumacher in the tunnel. Earlier in the race, a fast-starting Takuma Sato suffered a spectacular engine failure on the third lap at the Tabac corner; the smoke from the rear of his BAR machine blinded the queue behind him, causing Giancarlo Fisichella to mount the back of David Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren and flip over. Olivier Panis stalled as the race was due to begin, shortening the race to 77 laps as the remaining drivers completed a second formation lap. Panis later recovered to eighth place as he and sixth-placed Cristiano da Matta scored Toyota&#x27;s first points of the season.

Michael Schumacher returned to his winning ways by leading the majority of the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, with Barrichello and Button following him home in second and third. Ralf Schumacher, meanwhile, collided with da Matta at the start, causing both cars to retire from the race. Front-row starter and one-time leader Sato joined the list of retirements with a late engine failure, as did the McLaren duo of Räikkönen and Coulthard, both of whose Mercedes engines expired at the manufacturer&#x27;s home race.

=== North American doubleheader and return to Europe ===

At the Canadian Grand Prix, Timo Glock replaced Giorgio Pantano at Jordan for financial reasons. Ralf Schumacher qualified on pole position, joined by Jenson Button on the front row, with Michael Schumacher only starting from sixth. After a series of lead changes, the elder Schumacher ultimately crossed the line first, followed by his brother and Rubens Barrichello. But the Williams of Ralf Schumacher—along with his fifth-placed teammate Juan Pablo Montoya and the Toyotas of Cristiano da Matta and Olivier Panis in eighth and tenth—would later be excluded from the results due to an irregularity in the brake ducts, promoting Barrichello to second and Button to third. The McLaren and Jordan teams were also beneficiaries of the four disqualifications, with Glock—in his Formula One début—and Nick Heidfeld both scoring points.

Barrichello qualified on pole for the United States Grand Prix, with Michael Schumacher alongside him. Schumacher would go on to win once more as Barrichello and Takuma Sato—scoring his first and only Formula One podium—completed the top three. It was a race dominated by accidents, however, beginning with a first-lap incident that eliminated Gianmaria Bruni, Giorgio Pantano, Felipe Massa és Christian Klien. On the ninth lap, Fernando Alonso suffered a puncture and crashed at the end of the start-finish straight, with Ralf Schumacher crashing at the oval section for the same reason on the following lap. Schumacher suffered a concussion and fractured vertebrae in that final-corner accident, which kept him out of the following six races. Thanks to the high attrition rate, only eight cars crossed the line; the final finisher was Zsolt Baumgartner, who became Hungary&#x27;s first points scorer and earned the Minardi team their first point since 2002.

In France, Michael Schumacher beat Alonso with a clever four-stop strategy. Barrichello overtook the second Renault of Jarno Trulli on the final corner of the race to snatch third place, while Marc Gené, who replaced the injured Ralf Schumacher at Williams for the French and British Grands Prix, finished tenth. Michael Schumacher overpowered polesitter Kimi Räikkönen to take his tenth win of the season at Silverstone. Räikkönen, who finished second, bagged McLaren&#x27;s first podium in 2004, ahead of Barrichello in third. The race was notable for Jarno Trulli&#x27;s massive accident, the Italian losing control of his car at Bridge and hitting the tyre barrier before rolling in the gravel trap.

Schumacher won from pole at the German Grand Prix, beating Jenson Button—who started thirteenth after a ten-place penalty for an engine change—and Fernando Alonso. Front-row starter Juan Pablo Montoya could only manage a fifth-place finish, while his new teammate Antônio Pizzonia finished seventh. After setting the fastest lap of the race, Kimi Räikkönen suffered a high-speed rear wing failure at the end of the start-finish straight on lap 14 and crashed into the tyre wall.

A string of disappointing results from Toyota&#x27;s Cristiano da Matta led to his replacement by test driver Ricardo Zonta from the Hungarian Grand Prix onward. There, Schumacher led another Ferrari 1–2 in both qualifying and the race to secure Ferrari the Constructors&#x27; trophy, with the race&#x27;s 2003 winner Alonso completing the podium.

The Belgian Grand Prix also included numerous accidents and safety car periods. A first-lap collision between Mark Webber and Takuma Sato eliminated both of them; Zsolt Baumgartner avoided the initial wreckage but knocked teammate Gianmaria Bruni&#x27;s car into the wall, which then bounced back and collected Giorgio Pantano. On the thirtieth lap, Jenson Button suffered a right-rear puncture and lost control of his car, crashing into the Minardi of Zsolt Baumgartner that he was attempting to lap. Kimi Räikkönen eventually won the race, his first of the year, from a lowly 10th place on the grid. Michael Schumacher finished second and thus secured himself the world title, as his forty-point gap to Rubens Barrichello—who finished the race third—was by that point insurmountable.

=== Concluding rounds and Brazilian finale ===

At the Italian Grand Prix, Barrichello led a Ferrari 1–2 in front of the loyal Tifosi, although Schumacher, who started third, spun off on the first lap and had to rejoin the race at the back of the field. Following the race, Jarno Trulli parted ways with Renault, with 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve returning to Formula One as his replacement. Immediately before the Chinese Grand Prix, fellow Italian Giorgio Pantano was dropped by the Jordan team and replaced once more by Timo Glock for the last three races. That race was also won by Barrichello from pole, with Button and Räikkönen less than 2 seconds behind. Michael Schumacher started from the pit lane and could only make it to 12th place following several mistakes and a puncture, while a returning Ralf Schumacher retired with suspension damage.

The Japanese Grand Prix weekend was affected by Typhoon Ma-on, which caused widespread damage to parts of Japan and saw the postponement of qualifying to the morning of race day. With the rain dying down in time for the race, Michael Schumacher took his 13th win from pole, with his brother Ralf starting and finishing second and Jenson Button completing the podium. A collision between David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello—who set the fastest lap of the race—eliminated both of them from the Grand Prix. Following his acrimonious split from Renault, Jarno Trulli finished eleventh in his first race for Toyota, while his teammate Olivier Panis retired from the sport after the race.

The Brazilian Grand Prix was won by Juan Pablo Montoya—who also set the fastest lap—from second on the grid, with his soon-to-be McLaren teammate Kimi Räikkönen and polesitter Barrichello finishing behind him. It was Montoya&#x27;s last outing for Williams and the team&#x27;s last victory until the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. It was also the final race for Minardi duo Zsolt Baumgartner and Gianmaria Bruni and the Jaguar team&#x27;s last entry before they were bought by Red Bull. David Coulthard finished his last season with (the team he had been with since ) without a podium finish during the season.

<text>Panorama Mesdag is a panorama by Hendrik Willem Mesdag. Housed in a purpose-built museum in The Hague, the panorama is a cylindrical painting (also known as a Cyclorama) more than 14 metres high and about 40 metres in diameter (120 metres in circumference). From an observation gallery in the centre of the room the cylindrical perspective creates the illusion that the viewer is on a high sand dune overlooking the sea, beaches and village of Scheveningen in the late 19th century. A foreground of fake terrain around the viewing gallery hides the base of the painting and makes the illusion more convincing.

==History==
Mesdag was a marine painter of the Hague School; in 1880 he was engaged by a Belgian company to paint the panorama, which with the assistance of his wife Sientje Mesdag-van Houten and some student painters (including George Hendrik Breitner), was completed by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and the company went bankrupt in 1886. Mesdag purchased the panorama and met its losses from his own pocket. The panorama is now the oldest surviving panorama in its original location.

<text>Louis-Gustave Binger (; 14 October 1856 – 10 November 1936) was a French officer and explorer who claimed the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire for France.

Binger was born at Strasbourg in the Bas-Rhin . In 1887 he traveled from Senegal up to the Niger River, arriving at Grand Bassam in 1889. During this expedition he discovered that the Mountains of Kong did not exist. He described this journey in his work &quot;Du Niger au golfe de Guinée par le pays de Kong et le Mossi&quot; (From the Niger to the Gulf of Guinea though the land of the Kong and the Mossi) (1891).

In 1892 he returned to the Guinea Coast to superintend the forming of the boundaries between the British and French colonies. In 1893 Binger was appointed governor of the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, where he remained until 1898. He returned to France that year, to an administrative post in Paris at the French Colonial Ministry. In 1899 the Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Founder&#x27;s Medal for his exploratory work.

Louis Gustave Binger died at L&#x27;Isle-Adam, Île-de-France, France and was buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. The city of Bingerville in the Ivory Coast is named after him.

<text>Miss Colombia (Formally &quot;Concurso Nacional de Belleza de Colombia&quot;, English: &quot;National Beauty Contest of Colombia&quot;) is the national beauty pageant organization in Colombia.

The current Miss Colombia is Catalina Duque Abréu of Antioquia, who was crowned on 10 November 2024.

==Pageant rules==
Colombia has rigid and strict rules regarding participation of any Miss Universe aspirant: once a contestant registers for the pageant, she is confined to her own Department and cannot move or relocate to other states/provinces. However, she can participate more than once for the same department. As example, the winner of 2003 had already come in fourth place at the Miss Valle pageant the year before she won and eventually went on to win the national title and crown.

Initially, the pageant&#x27;s winners held the title for six months period; Yolanda Emiliani Roman, Miss Colombia 1934, held her title for the longest reign in the pageant&#x27;s history. The winner of Señorita Colombia previously represented her country at Miss Universe, but will attend Miss International following a loss of the franchise in 2020. On occasion, when the winner does not qualify (such as due to age) for either contest, a runner-up finalist is selected by the national director and sent.

==Titleholders==

===Señorita Colombia – Universo===
Main article: Miss Universe Colombia
::&quot;The winner of Señorita Colombia represents her country at Miss Universe. On occasion, when the winner does not qualify (due to age) for either contest, a runner-up is sent. Since 2020, the election of Miss Universe Colombia took over the franchise of Miss Universe in Colombia.&quot;

===Señorita Colombia – Mundo===
::&quot;From 1968 to 1990, the National Beauty Contest of Colombia organization were the license holders, and the Colombian representative to Miss World. Began 1991 the election of Miss Mundo Colombia organization took over the franchise of Miss World in Colombia.&quot;

===Señorita Colombia – Supranacional===

::&quot;From 2010 to 2016 the Miss Earth Colombia organization were the license holders, and the Colombian representative to Miss Supranational. In 2017, Señorita Colombia was in charge of selecting the Colombian representative for Miss Supranational until 2023. In 2022, The winner of Señorita Colombia represents her country at Miss Supranational.&quot;

===Señorita Colombia – Grand International===
Main article: Miss Grand Colombia

==Controversies==

===David Letterman on Miss Colombia===
In May 2001, David Letterman joked about the &#x27;special talent&#x27; which the then-reigning Miss Colombia Andrea Noceti possessed – that she was able to &quot;swallow 50 balloons full of heroin&quot; for the (non-existent) talent competition in the Miss Universe 2001 pageant. The remark not only infuriated the beauty queen, but also the people in Colombia.

Miss Colombia openly threatened to sue Letterman but later withdrawn the statement after Letterman formally apologised to her in the Late Show with David Letterman about the quip made. Letterman had invited the beauty queen to appear on his show as a gesture of appeasement.

== Sponsors ==
Some of the Miss Colombia Beauty Contest include jewelries like Joyeria Casareo and André Laurent Joyeria, media companies like RCN TV and Cromos Magazine and beauty companies like Jolie de Vogue and Leonisa.

<doc id="1126638" wikidata="Q188211" url="?curid=1126638" title="Invariant (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, an invariant is a property of a mathematical object (or a class of mathematical objects) which remains unchanged after operations or transformations of a certain type are applied to the objects. The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to isometries of the Euclidean plane. The phrases &quot;invariant under&quot; and &quot;invariant to&quot; a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an equivalence relation is a property that is constant on each equivalence class.

Invariants are used in diverse areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology, algebra and discrete mathematics. Some important classes of transformations are defined by an invariant they leave unchanged. For example, conformal maps are defined as transformations of the plane that preserve angles. The discovery of invariants is an important step in the process of classifying mathematical objects.

== Examples ==
A simple example of invariance is expressed in our ability to count. For a finite set of objects of any kind, there is a number to which we always arrive, regardless of the order in which we count the objects in the set. The quantity—a cardinal number—is associated with the set, and is invariant under the process of counting.

An identity is an equation that remains true for all values of its variables. There are also inequalities that remain true when the values of their variables change.

The distance between two points on a number line is not changed by adding the same quantity to both numbers. On the other hand, multiplication does not have this same property, as distance is not invariant under multiplication.

Angles and ratios of distances are invariant under scalings, rotations, translations and reflections. These transformations produce similar shapes, which is the basis of trigonometry. In contrast, angles and ratios are not invariant under non-uniform scaling (such as stretching). The sum of a triangle&#x27;s interior angles (180°) is invariant under all the above operations. As another example, all circles are similar: they can be transformed into each other and the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is invariant (denoted by the Greek letter π (pi)).

Some more complicated examples:
* The real part and the absolute value of a complex number are invariant under complex conjugation.
* The tricolorability of knots.
* The degree of a polynomial is invariant under a linear change of variables.
* The dimension and homology groups of a topological object are invariant under homeomorphism.
* The number of fixed points of a dynamical system is invariant under many mathematical operations.
* Euclidean distance is invariant under orthogonal transformations.
* Area is invariant under linear maps which have determinant ±1 (see ).
* Some invariants of projective transformations include collinearity of three or more points, concurrency of three or more lines, conic sections, and the cross-ratio.
* The determinant, trace, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues of a linear endomorphism are invariant under a change of basis. In other words, the spectrum of a matrix is invariant under a change of basis.
* The principal invariants of tensors do not change with rotation of the coordinate system (see Invariants of tensors).
* The singular values of a matrix are invariant under orthogonal transformations.
* Lebesgue measure is invariant under translations.
* The variance of a probability distribution is invariant under translations of the real line. Hence the variance of a random variable is unchanged after the addition of a constant.
* The fixed points of a transformation are the elements in the domain that are invariant under the transformation. They may, depending on the application, be called symmetric with respect to that transformation. For example, objects with translational symmetry are invariant under certain translations.
*The integral formula_1 of the Gaussian curvature formula_2 of a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold formula_3 is invariant under changes of the Riemannian metric &quot;formula_4&quot;. This is the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

===MU puzzle===
The MU puzzle is a good example of a logical problem where determining an invariant is of use for an impossibility proof. The puzzle asks one to start with the word MI and transform it into the word MU, using in each step one of the following transformation rules:

# If a string ends with an I, a U may be appended (&quot;x&quot;I → &quot;x&quot;IU)
# The string after the M may be completely duplicated (M&quot;x&quot; → M&quot;xx&quot;)
# Any three consecutive I&#x27;s (III) may be replaced with a single U (&quot;x&quot;III&quot;y&quot; → &quot;x&quot;U&quot;y&quot;)
# Any two consecutive U&#x27;s may be removed (&quot;x&quot;UU&quot;y&quot; → &quot;xy&quot;)

An example derivation (with superscripts indicating the applied rules) is
:MI →2 MII →2 MIIII →3 MUI →2 MUIUI →1 MUIUIU →2 MUIUIUUIUIU →4 MUIUIIUIU → ...

In light of this, one might wonder whether it is possible to convert MI into MU, using only these four transformation rules. One could spend many hours applying these transformation rules to strings. However, it might be quicker to find a property that is invariant to all rules (that is, not changed by any of them), and that demonstrates that getting to MU is impossible. By looking at the puzzle from a logical standpoint, one might realize that the only way to get rid of any I&#x27;s is to have three consecutive I&#x27;s in the string. This makes the following invariant interesting to consider:

:&quot;The number of I&#x27;s in the string is not a multiple of 3&quot;.

This is an invariant to the problem, if for each of the transformation rules the following holds: if the invariant held before applying the rule, it will also hold after applying it. Looking at the net effect of applying the rules on the number of I&#x27;s and U&#x27;s, one can see this actually is the case for all rules:

The table above shows clearly that the invariant holds for each of the possible transformation rules, which means that whichever rule one picks, at whatever state, if the number of I&#x27;s was not a multiple of three before applying the rule, then it will not be afterwards either.

Given that there is a single I in the starting string MI, and one is not a multiple of three, one can then conclude that it is impossible to go from MI to MU (as the number of I&#x27;s will never be a multiple of three).

==Invariant set==

A subset &quot;S&quot; of the domain &quot;U&quot; of a mapping &quot;T&quot;: &quot;U&quot; → &quot;U&quot; is an invariant set under the mapping when formula_5 Note that the elements of &quot;S&quot; are not fixed, even though the set &quot;S&quot; is fixed in the power set of &quot;U&quot;. (Some authors use the terminology &quot;setwise invariant,&quot; vs. &quot;pointwise invariant,&quot; to distinguish between these cases.)
For example, a circle is an invariant subset of the plane under a rotation about the circle&#x27;s center. Further, a conical surface is invariant as a set under a homothety of space.

An invariant set of an operation &quot;T&quot; is also said to be stable under &quot;T&quot;. For example, the normal subgroups that are so important in group theory are those subgroups that are stable under the inner automorphisms of the ambient group.
In linear algebra, if a linear transformation &quot;T&quot; has an eigenvector v, then the line through 0 and v is an invariant set under &quot;T&quot;, in which case the eigenvectors span an invariant subspace which is stable under &quot;T&quot;.

When &quot;T&quot; is a screw displacement, the screw axis is an invariant line, though if the pitch is non-zero, &quot;T&quot; has no fixed points.

In probability theory and ergodic theory, invariant sets are usually defined via the stronger property formula_6 When the map formula_7 is measurable, invariant sets form a sigma-algebra, the invariant sigma-algebra.

== Formal statement ==

The notion of invariance is formalized in three different ways in mathematics: via group actions, presentations, and deformation.

=== Unchanged under group action ===
Firstly, if one has a group &quot;G&quot; acting on a mathematical object (or set of objects) &quot;X,&quot; then one may ask which points &quot;x&quot; are unchanged, &quot;invariant&quot; under the group action, or under an element &quot;g&quot; of the group.

Frequently one will have a group acting on a set &quot;X&quot;, which leaves one to determine which objects in an &quot;associated&quot; set &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are invariant. For example, rotation in the plane about a point leaves the point about which it rotates invariant, while translation in the plane does not leave any points invariant, but does leave all lines parallel to the direction of translation invariant as lines. Formally, define the set of lines in the plane &quot;P&quot; as &quot;L&quot;(&quot;P&quot;); then a rigid motion of the plane takes lines to lines – the group of rigid motions acts on the set of lines – and one may ask which lines are unchanged by an action.

More importantly, one may define a &quot;function&quot; on a set, such as &quot;radius of a circle in the plane&quot;, and then ask if this function is invariant under a group action, such as rigid motions.

Dual to the notion of invariants are &quot;coinvariants,&quot; also known as &quot;orbits,&quot; which formalizes the notion of congruence: objects which can be taken to each other by a group action. For example, under the group of rigid motions of the plane, the perimeter of a triangle is an invariant, while the set of triangles congruent to a given triangle is a coinvariant.

These are connected as follows: invariants are constant on coinvariants (for example, congruent triangles have the same perimeter), while two objects which agree in the value of one invariant may or may not be congruent (for example, two triangles with the same perimeter need not be congruent). In classification problems, one might seek to find a complete set of invariants, such that if two objects have the same values for this set of invariants, then they are congruent.

For example, triangles such that all three sides are equal are congruent under rigid motions, via SSS congruence, and thus the lengths of all three sides form a complete set of invariants for triangles. The three angle measures of a triangle are also invariant under rigid motions, but do not form a complete set as incongruent triangles can share the same angle measures. However, if one allows scaling in addition to rigid motions, then the AAA similarity criterion shows that this is a complete set of invariants.

=== Independent of presentation ===
Secondly, a function may be defined in terms of some presentation or decomposition of a mathematical object; for instance, the Euler characteristic of a cell complex is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension. One may forget the cell complex structure and look only at the underlying topological space (the manifold) – as different cell complexes give the same underlying manifold, one may ask if the function is &quot;independent&quot; of choice of &quot;presentation,&quot; in which case it is an &quot;intrinsically&quot; defined invariant. This is the case for the Euler characteristic, and a general method for defining and computing invariants is to define them for a given presentation, and then show that they are independent of the choice of presentation. Note that there is no notion of a group action in this sense.

The most common examples are:
* The presentation of a manifold in terms of coordinate charts – invariants must be unchanged under change of coordinates.
* Various manifold decompositions, as discussed for Euler characteristic.
* Invariants of a presentation of a group.

=== Unchanged under perturbation ===
Thirdly, if one is studying an object which varies in a family, as is common in algebraic geometry and differential geometry, one may ask if the property is unchanged under perturbation (for example, if an object is constant on families or invariant under change of metric).

==Invariants in computer science==

In computer science, an invariant is a logical assertion that is always held to be true during a certain phase of execution of a computer program. For example, a loop invariant is a condition that is true at the beginning and the end of every iteration of a loop.

Invariants are especially useful when reasoning about the correctness of a computer program. The theory of optimizing compilers, the methodology of design by contract, and formal methods for determining program correctness, all rely heavily on invariants.

Programmers often use assertions in their code to make invariants explicit. Some object oriented programming languages have a special syntax for specifying class invariants.

===Automatic invariant detection in imperative programs===

Abstract interpretation tools can compute simple invariants of given imperative computer programs. The kind of properties that can be found depend on the abstract domains used. Typical example properties are single integer variable ranges like codice_1, relations between several variables like codice_2, and modulus information like codice_3. Academic research prototypes also consider simple properties of pointer structures.

More sophisticated invariants generally have to be provided manually.
In particular, when verifying an imperative program using the Hoare calculus, a loop invariant has to be provided manually for each loop in the program, which is one of the reasons that this approach is generally impractical for most programs.

In the context of the above MU puzzle example, there is currently no general automated tool that can detect that a derivation from MI to MU is impossible using only the rules 1–4. However, once the abstraction from the string to the number of its &quot;I&quot;s has been made by hand, leading, for example, to the following C program, an abstract interpretation tool will be able to detect that codice_4 cannot be 0, and hence the &quot;while&quot;-loop will never terminate.
void MUPuzzle(void) {
 volatile int RandomRule;
 int ICount = 1, UCount = 0;
 while (ICount % 3 != 0) // non-terminating loop
 switch(RandomRule) {
 case 1: UCount += 1; break;
 case 2: ICount *= 2; UCount *= 2; break;
 case 3: ICount -= 3; UCount += 1; break;
 case 4: UCount -= 2; break;
 } // computed invariant: ICount % 3 == 1 || ICount % 3 == 2

<text>In theoretical physics, an invariant is an observable of a physical system which remains unchanged under some transformation. Invariance, as a broader term, also applies to the no change of form of physical laws under a transformation, and is closer in scope to the mathematical definition. Invariants of a system are deeply tied to the symmetries imposed by its environment.

Invariance is an important concept in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their symmetries and invariants.

==Examples==

In classical and quantum mechanics, invariance of space under translation results in momentum being an invariant and the conservation of momentum, whereas invariance of the origin of time, i.e. translation in time, results in energy being an invariant and the conservation of energy. In general, by Noether&#x27;s theorem, any invariance of a physical system under a continuous symmetry leads to a fundamental conservation law. 

In crystals, the electron density is periodic and invariant with respect to discrete translations by unit cell vectors. In very few materials, this symmetry can be broken due to enhanced electron correlations.

Another examples of physical invariants are the speed of light, and charge and mass of a particle observed from two reference frames moving with respect to one another (invariance under a spacetime Lorentz transformation), and invariance of time and acceleration under a Galilean transformation between two such frames moving at low velocities. 

Quantities can be invariant under some common transformations but not under others. For example, the velocity of a particle is invariant when switching coordinate representations from rectangular to curvilinear coordinates, but is not invariant when transforming between frames of reference that are moving with respect to each other. Other quantities, like the speed of light, are always invariant.

Physical laws are said to be invariant under transformations when their predictions remain unchanged. This generally means that the form of the law (e.g. the type of differential equations used to describe the law) is unchanged in transformations so that no additional or different solutions are obtained.

Covariance and contravariance generalize the mathematical properties of invariance in tensor mathematics, and are frequently used in electromagnetism, special relativity, and general relativity.

==Informal usage==
In the field of physics, the adjective covariant (as in covariance and contravariance of vectors) is often used informally as a synonym for &quot;invariant&quot;. For example, the Schrödinger equation does not keep its written form under the coordinate transformations of special relativity. Thus, a physicist might say that the Schrödinger equation is &quot;not covariant&quot;. In contrast, the Klein–Gordon equation and the Dirac equation do keep their written form under these coordinate transformations. Thus, a physicist might say that these equations are &quot;covariant&quot;.

Despite this usage of &quot;covariant&quot;, it is more accurate to say that the Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations are invariant, and that the Schrödinger equation is not invariant. Additionally, to remove ambiguity, the transformation by which the invariance is evaluated should be indicated.

<text>Fécamp () is a commune in the northwestern French department of Seine-Maritime.

==Geography==
Fécamp is situated in the valley of the river Valmont, at the heart of the Pays de Caux, on the Alabaster Coast. It is around northeast of Le Havre, and around northwest of Rouen.

==History==

===Origin of the name===
According to its late medieval founding legend, the trunk of a fig tree (&quot;ficus&quot;) carrying the Precious Blood of Christ collected by Joseph of Arimathea was washed ashore on the riverbank at Fécamp in the 1st century. Immediately, a fountain of holy blood gushed from the site; the relic attracted many medieval pilgrims, enhancing the reputation of the city.

The monks&#x27; legend justified the artificial etymology of the name to &quot;Fici-campus&quot;, the camp of the fig tree. Fécamp, however, is mentioned in 875 as &quot;Fiscannum&quot; and in 990 as &quot;Fiscannus&quot; and as late as 1496 which stem from the Germanic root &quot;fisc&quot; (English &quot;fish&quot;) with an unknown suffix. It used to be the name of the Valmont River.

===Pre-history===
The prehistoric site, on the high ground inland from the port of Fécamp, reveals human occupation dating back to Neolithic times. Spreading over 21 hectares, surrounded by walls and ditches for a length of nearly 2000 meters, including a praetorian door. Objects recovered range in date from the Neolithic until Roman times.

===Roman times===
Many items of the Gallo-Roman period have been found locally, particularly coins (including two gold Gallic coins found in 1839). A bronze axe, of Celtic design, was unearthed in 1859.

Fécamp was on the ancient road linking Arques-la-Bataille and Lillebonne with the north of Gaul. The archaeological diggings around the Ducal palace (in the grounds of the present abbey) in 1973-1984 revealed some evidence of the La Tène Celtic culture and Gallo-Roman works. Two Gallo-Roman cemeteries have also been discovered.

During Roman times, a road linked Fécamp to Étretat, passing through the present-day village of Fond-Pitron. The current D940 follows the original Roman road.

===Middle Ages===
====The Abbey====

===More from the Middle Ages===

In the 7th century, Saint Leger was exiled to Fécamp. In 932, William I of Normandy (Long-Sword) founded the castle that was to be the residence of the Dukes of Normandy up until 1204, after which the Norman Duchy was integrated within the French royal domain. The castle was the birthplace of many Norman dukes, including Richard I of Normandy (born 933) and Richard II of Normandy (who died 22 August 1027).

In 1202, King John of England granted a community system to Fécamp. In 1410, the English razed the town. In 1449, Fécamp was freed from the English occupation.

For Fécamp, the French Wars of Religion ended in July 1593, when Captain de Bois-Rosé rallied the city to Henry IV of France after his conversion to Catholicism. It was at Fécamp that Charles II of England landed, on 16 October 1651, soon after the Battle of Worcester, where he had been finally defeated by Cromwell.

===Modern era===
The history of Fécamp has always revolved around the fishing industry and its harbour (first mentioned in the 11th century).
The reputation of the salt-herrings of Fécamp was established as early as the 10th century, that of smoked herrings from the 13th century. An association of whale fishermen was created in the 11th century.
Fishing for cod started commercially in the 16th century, under the impetus of Nicolas Selles, an early shipping magnate.
Throughout the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, Fécamp had an important role as the chief fishing port in France for cod and cod-related fish. This was the case up until the 1970s, when Canada stopped all access to their fishing grounds.
First practiced by three-masted sailing ships, Atlantic fishing trips could last more than six months, the time taken to fill the hold with cod, which were salted to preserve them.

The fishing was actually carried out in small boats, carrying only two or three fishermen. Many of these small boats would be lost in the fog and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing-boats.
* In the 19th century, the recipe for Bénédictine liqueur was “rediscovered” by Alexandre Legrand. The Palais Bénédictine now houses a visitors’ centre, which shows how the liqueur is made.

<doc id="1126657" wikidata="Q740865" url="?curid=1126657" title="Wadi Halfa">
<text> (, , &quot;Esparto Valley&quot;) is a city in the Northern state of Sudan on the shores of Lake Nubia near the border with Egypt. It is the terminus of a rail line from Khartoum and the point where goods are transferred from rail to ferries going down the lake. As of 2007, the city had a population of 15,725. The city is located amidst numerous ancient Nubian antiquities and was the focus of much archaeological work by teams seeking to save artifacts from the flooding caused by the completion of the Aswan Dam.

==Climate ==
Wadi Halfa has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) typical of the Nubian Desert. Wadi Halfa receives each year the highest mean amount of bright sunshine, with an extreme value of 4,300 h, which is equal to 97–98 % of possible sunshine. In addition to this, the town receives a mean annual amount of rainfall of . Many years usually pass without any rain falling on the ground.

Wadi Halfa experiences long, hot summers and short, warm winters. The annual mean temperature is about . From May to September, inclusively, the averages highs exceed . The annual mean rate of potential evaporation is also among the highest found throughout the world, totalling as much as .

==History==

Archaeological evidence indicates that settlements have existed in the area since ancient times, and during the Middle Kingdom period, the Egyptian colony of Buhen across the river existed until the Roman period. The modern town of Wadi Halfa was founded in the 19th century, when it became a port on the Nile for steamers from Aswan, such as the &quot;Nubia&quot;. During the Turko-Egyptian conquest of 1820, Wadi Halfa was used as a stopping point for troops headed south. Communications developed in the latter half of the 19th century, with a telegraph line to Egypt connected in 1866 and ill-fated attempts to build a railway to Kerma in 1873 and 1877. The eventual establishment of the Sudanese rail head at Wadi Halfaconnected via steamer to the Egyptian network via a port just south of Asyutcaused the site to eclipse the former caravan site at Korosko.

In 1885, Wadi Halfa entered a period of turmoil after falling under the Mahdist War regime. Conflicts frequently broke out on the border, and in 1889, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi&#x27;s army entered the town on the way to the Battle of Tushki. Wadi Halfa was briefly the headquarters of the British-led Egyptian and British forces under Kitchener seeking to defeat the forces of Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi proclaimed by his disciples, from 1881 to 1885. The rail line up the Nile was originally begun in 1897 to support this military buildup. It extends, via Atbara, to El Obeid and beyond into southern and western Sudan. 

A river monitoring station functioned in Wadi Halfa between 1911 and 1931, to monitor changes associated with the Aswan reservoir, but from 1931 to 1962 it was moved to Kajnarty, 47 kilometres to the north of the town. A railroad hotel was built in the town during the 20th century, and during World War II, Wadi Halfa was a communications post for Allied forces in Africa. By 1956, the town had grown to a population of 11,000. On 8 November 1959, the signing of the Sudanese-UAR Nile Water Agreement brought the area into much debate. This was because the agreement to flood the area upon the creation of the Aswan Dam would directly affect some 52,000 people in the area who would have to be resettled over a four-year period from 1960. Worst affected were the Nubians who demonstrated in Wadi Halfa on 23–24 October 1960 against being resettled. Subsequently, on 26 October demonstrations took place in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, which had to be dispersed by police using tear gas. The government was quick to suppress the agitation, placing Wadi Halfa under martial law and terminating communications with the rest of the country. Protests in Khartoum, mainly by students, led to the temporary closure of the Khartoum campus of Cairo University and about 50 arrests. The old town was completely destroyed after the construction of the Aswan High Dam due to flooding in 1964. Most of the town was relocated, and by 1965 the population of New Halfa was just 3,200. During the 1970s, the area was under intense scrutiny by archaeologists working to protect ancient Nubian monuments.

Wadi Halfa was featured in part four, entitled &quot;Shifting Sands&quot;, of the eight part Michael Palin television documentary series &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; released by the BBC in 1992.

In 2005, a museum and interactive Nubian village were planned for Wadi Halfa, but by 2014 nothing had been done.

==Economy==

Agriculture plays an important role in local economy. The Chinese have invested in a fish processing plant in the town.

== Transport ==
The trans-African automobile route — the Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Wadi Halfa. 

In 2012 agreement was achieved between Sudan and Egypt to complete a Standard gauge link Aswan and Wadi Halfa, whose progress was stalled by civil unrest in Sudan in 2023.

<text>Open Up and Say... Ahh! is the second studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released on April 27, 1988, through Enigma Records and Capitol Records. It proved to be the band&#x27;s most successful release, and spawned four hit singles: &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Your Mama Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (a Loggins and Messina cover) and their only number one single to date, &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;. The album peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Open Up and Say Ahh&quot; was certified platinum in 1988 and 5× platinum in 1991 by the RIAA. It also has been certified 4× platinum in Canada and gold by the BPI.

==Production and marketing==
The album was recorded and mixed at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Paul Stanley from KISS (whose song &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; had been covered by Poison the year before) was originally selected to produce the record, but was unable to fulfill the role due to scheduling conflicts. Instead, the band worked with Tom Werman. Werman was an experienced rock producer, having worked with artists such as Ted Nugent, Cheap Trick, Twisted Sister and Mötley Crüe.
Following the album was the release of the band&#x27;s first video compilation, titled &quot;Sight for Sore Ears&quot;, which featured all the music videos from &quot;Open Up and Say...Ahh!&quot; and &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;.

The original front cover of the album, which featured model Bambi dressed as a luminous red demon with a protruding tongue, caused controversy among parental groups. The band changed the cover so that only the model&#x27;s eyes were visible.

==Track information==
Vocalist Bret Michaels allegedly wrote the band&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot;, in response to a failed love affair with a Los Angeles stripper. Poison had been playing at a cowboy bar called The Ritz in Dallas, Texas. After the show, Michaels called the woman at her apartment and heard a man&#x27;s voice in the background. Heartbroken, he wrote the song with an acoustic guitar in a laundromat.

The first single &quot;Nothin&#x27; But a Good Time&quot; was born from the merger of a guitar riff by C. C. DeVille and a chorus by Michaels. Michaels later explained that he was in search of a &quot;kick ass big arena rock song&quot; which would make him feel good about his life. The song was about &quot;not wanting to be held back by working a job and being depressed&quot;, as portrayed in its music video.

The fourth single, &quot;Your Mama Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, was a cover version of the 1972 song written by Loggins and Messina from their 1972 self-titled album.

Two additional songs written for the record, &quot;Livin&#x27; for the Minute&quot; and &quot;Face the Hangman&quot;, were later released as B-sides. &quot;Face the Hangman&quot; was later included on &quot;Crack a Smile... and More!&quot;.
