<text>Kyneton ( ) is a town in the Macedon Ranges region of central Victoria, Australia. The Calder Freeway bypasses Kyneton to the north and east.

The town has three main streets: Mollison Street, Piper Street and High Street. Piper Street has the oldest streetscape of these, and still has many of its original buildings. The railway station, about from Melbourne on the Deniliquin railway line, is a terminus for two weekday peak-hour trains. The town is the council seat of the Shire of Macedon Ranges. At the 2021 census, Kyneton recorded a population of 7,513.

==History==
The region is located on the border of Djadjawurrung and Taungurong country. Before British colonisation these Indigenous Australian people resided mostly along the Coliban and Campaspe Rivers. Village-like communities existed in particular in the area around the junction of these rivers. Large in-ground stone ovens which they used to cook meat and murnong were commonly found in the region.

Major Thomas Mitchell, New South Wales Surveyor-General crossed and named the Campaspe River near present-day Kyneton on his 1836 expedition. 

Charles Ebden was the first British colonist to occupy the region that includes the site of Kyneton. On 26 May 1837, he established a sheep station which he called Carlsruhe 6 km south of what is now Kyneton. Thomas Walker, a Sydney businessman, walked from Sydney to Melbourne in 1837, recording the trip in a journal &quot;A month in the Bush of Australia&quot;. Thomas Walker met Ebden in May 1837 on the journey south.

In June 1838 the Waterloo Plains massacre of 8 - 23 Djadjawurrung people occurred on the newly established Barfold sheep run north of Kyneton.

Unlike a majority of towns in the area, Kyneton predates the separation of the Port Phillip District from the Colony of New South Wales and the Victorian gold rushes, having been established in 1850, whereas separation occurred and the gold rushes started the year after. Construction of Kyneton’s oldest surviving stone building, the Church of England Rectory, located at 61 Ebden Street, commenced in 1850 and is a rare surviving example of a pre-gold rush and pre-separation dwelling.

At this time, Kyneton was a growing rural centre, and served as a major stop for those heading to the gold rushes at Mount Alexander and Bendigo. The post office opened on 1 July 1843 as Mount Macedon and was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.

Local government came to Kyneton with the proclamation of the Kyneton Municipal District in 1857. This body was short-lived, as it was amalgamated with the Carlsruhe, the Lauriston &amp; Edgecombe, and the Tylden &amp; Trentham Road Districts in December 1864 to form the Kyneton United Road District. The Kyneton United Road District was almost immediately redesignated as Kyneton Shire in January 1865. It absorbed part of Glenlyon Shire in 1873, Malmsbury Borough in 1915 and part of Ballan Shire in 1921. In 1995 Kyneton Shire was abolished by part being amalgamated with Creswick Shire, part of Daylesford &amp; Glenlyon Shire and part of Talbot &amp; Clunes Shire to form Hepburn Shire, and the remainder being amalgamated with Gisborne Shire, Newham &amp; Woodend Shire and Romsey Shire to form Macedon Ranges Shire.

Joseph Furphy (aka Bek Stanwix) attended Kyneton primary school in the mid-1850s.

In November 1857, the humanitarian Caroline Chisholm moved her family to Kyneton, where her husband Archibald sat on the magistrates&#x27; bench and their two elder sons ran a store.

Kyneton Mounted Rifle Corps was formed in 1859, as one of the volunteer brigades set up when Britain was involved in wars in Afghanistan, Crimea and India. The Kyneton Mounted Rifle Corps was among the earliest in the colony of Victoria. The corps was later amalgamated in the 1880s to form the Victorian Mounted Rifles. Although the individual volunteer units had been disbanded by Federation (1901), many members became part of the 4th and 12th regiments of Light Horse at the Battle of Beersheba (1917) against Turkish troops of the Ottoman Empire.

Henry Gregory (politician) (1860-1940), Western Australian State and Federal politician, was born and educated in Kyneton.

Sir Stanley Argyle, Premier of Victoria 1932–35, was born in Kyneton in 1867 and the family lived at Rock House, a double fronted double story bluestone house that still stands to the west of the town on the banks of the Campaspe River.

Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Hurry (1868-1951), Commander of the 38th Battalion AIF in France in 1918, was born and died in Kyneton. He was the Member for Bendigo in the Commonwealth Parliament from 1922 until 1929.

The Kyneton Courthouse tried Ned Kelly in 1870 for robbery under arms. This courthouse has since continued to function, although only as a magistrates&#x27; court on Mondays.

== Population ==
In the 2021 Census, there were 7,513 people in Kyneton. 79.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.2%. 89.1% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 48.2%, Catholic 20.7% and Anglican 9.2%.

==Notable residents==
== Media ==
Kyneton&#x27;s main locally produced newspaper is the &quot;Midland Express&quot;, which also serves the surrounding region. The town receives television from Mount Alexander, and is served by a community radio station, 100.7 Highlands FM, based in Woodend.

==Climate==
Kyneton has a temperate mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), with distinctly cold mornings in the summer. Cold fronts occur frequently throughout much of the year, and even in summer they are a fairly regular occurrence. Light snowfalls occur sporadically in the cooler months and sleet is a common feature.

== Tourist attractions ==
Kyneton offers tourists several points of interest locally including the Botanic Gardens (established in the mid-1800s) and several walks along the Campaspe River.

Various Farmers Markets and festivals throughout the year make the town popular as a day trip destination. The township also serves as a starting point for many nearby destinations, such as Trentham Falls and Hanging Rock in Newham.

There are many attractions that can be accessed from Kyneton’s Northern Gateway including Black Hill Reserve, Bald Hill Reserve, Green Hill, Turpin Falls, Kyneton golf course, Kyneton Bushland Resort, Kyneton Ridge Winery, the Northern Biolinks corridor, Rollinson Reserve Horse riding facilities, The Cascades, etc 

Kyneton Museum, located in the old Bank of New South Wales building (built in 1856), houses an extensive collection of local historical items.

Being located well away from any heavily populated areas and their inherent light pollution, Kyneton is also a destination for astronomers seeking a clear view of the Southern Hemisphere night skies due to relatively low light pollution levels as opposed to Australian cities. The Cobaw Plateau is host to a 500-hectare facility for astronomical observation.

== Arts and Culture ==
The Macedon Ranges is home to the most artists per capita in Victoria. Kyneton, with the beauty in the changing seasons and enthusiastic cafe culture, is a hub for artists and crafts people.

<text>John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), professionally known as John Butler, is an American-Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is best known for his time as the eponymous frontman of the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band that formed in Perth Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998.

The John Butler Trio recorded five studio albums, including three that reached number one on the Australian charts: &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot;, &quot;Grand National&quot; and &quot;April Uprising&quot;. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association.

Butler was born in the United States and moved to Australia at an early age. He began playing the guitar at the age of sixteen. In 2002, Butler, along with several partners, formed their own record label Jarrah. He is also the co-founder of The JB Seed, a grant program that seeks to improve artistic diversity in Australia.

==Early life and education==
John Charles Wiltshire-Butler was born on 1 April 1975 to an Australian father, Darryl Wiltshire-Butler, and an American mother, Barbara (née Butler).[A] He was named after his paternal grandfather, John Wiltshire, a forestry worker who died fighting a bushfire in Nannup. Butler has British, Bulgarian, and Greek ancestry through his father. His genealogy was investigated on an episode of the SBS Television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which aired on 1 November 2009. The show traced his family history from his deceased grandfather&#x27;s war diaries through to ancestors in Bulgaria and the events of the 1876 April Uprising.

In January 1986, after his parents divorced, Butler&#x27;s father moved the family to Western Australia. They eventually settled in Pinjarra, a small country town, and Butler attended Pinjarra Primary School and Pinjarra Senior High School. He began playing guitar at the age of sixteen after his grandmother gave him a 1930s dobro belonging to his deceased grandfather. In 1996, he attended Curtin University in Perth and enrolled in an art teaching course, but eventually abandoned his studies to pursue a career in music. Some of his first musical performances were as a busker at the Fremantle Markets. Butler was also participant in the Western Australian skateboarding scene, and is recognised for his involvement with the internationally renowned &quot;Woolstores&quot; street spot in Fremantle.

==Career==
John travelled to Encinitas, California, after high school, where he spent two years with his brother Jim and began his music career in a band called Vitamin. John Butler&#x27;s first gig was 9 September 1994 at the Metaphor Cafe in Escondido, California. There Vitamin was written up and reviewed in &quot;Go&quot; magazine they performed all around the San Diego area and played one show in Houston, Texas opening for Dive, who later became Osmant between in 1995. Vitamin recorded two tracks, &quot;Deadhorse&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot; in the Belly Up Studios in Solana Beach, California in 1994. Vitamin bandmate Ozzie Rea fronted Perth funk band, Proton. The two can be found on &quot;The Live at Mojo&#x27;s&quot; CD and performed together on New Years Ever Y2K. John Butler was a busker on the streets of Fremantle playing his own compositions. In mid-1996, he released a self-recorded cassette of his instrumentals, &quot;Searching for Heritage&quot;, which sold 3,000 copies. He played different styles of music including &quot;Indian, Celtic, bluegrass and folk&quot;. Butler had his first paid performance in 1997 at the Seaview Hotel in Fremantle. In 1998, North Fremantle Mojo&#x27;s club owner Phil Stevens hired Butler as a regular performer. Stevens became his manager and later his business partner.

===Vitamin===
John Butler began his music career in a band called Vitamin. His first paying gig was at the Metaphor Cafe in Escondido, California. Vitamin was written up twice in the Escondido Times-Advocate. Vitamin gigged all over San Diego and played one show in Houston, Texas in 1995. Vitamin recorded two tracks, &quot;Deadhorse&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;, in the Belly Up Studios, Solana Beach, California in 1994. Vitamin bandmate Ozzie Rea moved to Australia in 1998 and fronted a Perth funk band called Proton who shared John Butler Trio&#x27;s drummer. The trio can be found on The Live at Mojo&#x27;s CD and gigged together on New Years Eve Y2K. The members of Vitamin were John Butler (12-string guitar, vocals); Ozzie Rea (vocals); Justin Bancroft (electric guitar); Taria Flower Star (bass); Duck Grossberg (bass); Desiree (congas); Gabe (Djembe); Jim (Harmonica); and Hailey Odom (harmonica).

===John Butler Trio===

====&quot;John Butler&quot;====
Butler was joined by drummer Jason McGann (Mojos sound engineer) and bass player Gavin Shoesmith to form the John Butler Trio and recorded the &quot;John Butler&quot; album which was released on Waterfront Records in December 1998. At various times the members of the John Butler Trio included drummers Michael Barker (2003–2009) and Nicky Bomba, bass players Rory Quirk (2001–2002), Andrew Fry (April 2002 – November 2002), Shannon Birchall (2002–2009) and Byron Luiters. The band&#x27;s musical style was influenced by Black Sabbath, Fleetwood Mac and Jeff Lang. The band toured throughout Western Australia in 1999. 

====&quot;Three&quot;====
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Three&quot;, was produced by Butler and Shaun O&#x27;Callaghan. It was released and distributed on Waterfront Records in April 2001. It featured the tracks &quot;Take&quot; and &quot;Betterman&quot;, which both received radio airplay on the Australian alternative youth radio station Triple J and rated in its annual Hottest 100. The band appeared at the Big Day Out concert series and the Woodford Folk Festival.

====&quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot;====
The song &quot;Zebra&quot; was released as a single in December 2003 and received mainstream radio airplay and reached the top 30 on the ARIA Charts. It was selected as &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; at the APRA Music Awards of 2004. The album, &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot;, was released in March 2004 and peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was the first independently released and distributed album to debut at No. 1 and Butler received the ARIA &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; award that same year.

====&quot;Grand National&quot;====
In September 2006, John Butler Trio released a promotional studio diary of the recording progress of their next album, &quot;Grand National&quot;, which was released in March 2007 and peaked at No. 1. In December 2006, &quot;Funky Tonight&quot; (EP) was released and included tracks from their live shows, such as &quot;Daniella&quot;, &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Funky Tonight&quot;. The band performed at the Melbourne entertainment hub, Federation Square at Easter 2007. The one off performance featured musicians who had collaborated on &quot;Grand National&quot;, including Vika and Linda Bull, Jex Saarhelart and Nicky Bomba. The performance was telecast on JTV and was released on DVD in November.

====&quot;April Uprising&quot;====
On 21 October, Butler featured on SBS Television&#x27;s documentary called &quot;Destination Australia – Bridge Between Two Worlds&quot; performing to refugee children in a class at Perth&#x27;s Highgate Primary School. Butler&#x27;s discovery of his Bulgarian ancestor&#x27;s involvement in the April Uprising provided the title for the trio&#x27;s next No. 1 album, &quot;April Uprising&quot;, issued in March 2010. Butler performed &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot; and the Kev Carmody/Paul Kelly song &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot; (with Carmody, Kelly, Missy Higgins and Dan Sultan) at the Kelly tribute concerts staged by Triple J in mid-November 2009, which was released as the 2010 live album &quot;Before Too Long&quot;.

On 19 February 2011, Butler performed for the first time with his wife Danielle, also known as Mama Kin, under the moniker Brave and the Bird, at the &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; event (an annual fundraiser for the homeless) held at the Fremantle Arts Centre.

====&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;====
The early sessions for the John Butler Trio&#x27;s sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band&#x27;s largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band&#x27;s lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band&#x27;s headquarters and the frontman&#x27;s artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: &quot;I had always brought the material.&quot; After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy.

Butler explained in an interview during the band&#x27;s US tour:

But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that&#x27;s kind of what I do. I&#x27;ll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I&#x27;ll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I&#x27;ll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.

One of the songs on the album, &quot;Wings Are Wide&quot;, was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather&#x27;s Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.&quot; Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills.

==Solo==
On 29 June 2007, Butler gave a live solo performance at Twist and Shout Records in Denver, Colorado, which was released in January 2008 as an eight-track EP, &quot;One Small Step&quot;, with A$1 from each record sold being donated to Oxfam&#x27;s &quot;Close the Gap&quot; campaign. &quot;One Small Step&quot; was Butler&#x27;s first official solo release. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007, Butler performed &quot;Funky Tonight&quot; in a collaboration with fellow Australian musician Keith Urban. Radio station, Triple J&#x27;s listeners voted &quot;Grand National&quot; their favourite album for 2007.

&quot;Ocean&quot; garnered John Butler newfound success when recordings of live performances of the song went viral on the internet.
Butler made a cameo appearance in 2009 Australian film, &quot;In Her Skin&quot;, as a busker. The film&#x27;s soundtrack featured three songs by the John Butler Trio, &quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;Caroline&quot; and &quot;What You Want&quot;.

&quot;Ocean&quot; by John Butler featured on the benefit album &#x27;Surfing Medicine: Volume I&#x27; released in 2009 with Slightly Stoopid, The Pharcyde, and others raised enough funds for charity to conduct an international peer reviewed herbal cancer research and treatment publication in Journal of Ethnobiology and project by Indigenous leaders from Hawai&#x27;i, Jamaica and Africa in Kormantse territory of Ghana which led to a cover story about the &#x27;Ocean&#x27; funded charity music project in a surf magazine that won 2 Silver Medals at the American Advertising Awards for best collateral material for any magazine issue and series in America in 2015. Kelly Slater also featured the track &#x27;Ocean&#x27; for the charity album project with John Butler in a PSA he released to help promote the project.

In July 2009, Butler undertook a solo overseas tour commencing in North America, where he played at the Montreal Jazz Festival, the Rothbury Music Festival in Michigan and The Mile High Music Festival in Denver. In North America he sold out headline shows in Toronto and Los Angeles. In Europe, Butler played at the Folies Bergère in Paris and London&#x27;s Union Chapel. He also performed at Cannes, Amsterdam and Antwerp.

Upon his return in August, he took part in the &quot;Cannot Buy My Soul&quot; concert at the Queensland Music Festival. Butler performed alongside other local musicians (including Paul Kelly, Missy Higgins, Troy Cassar-Daley, Clare Bowditch, Tex Perkins and Bernard Fanning) reinterpreting the catalogue of indigenous Australian musician Kev Carmody. Butler&#x27;s interpretation of the song, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal&quot;, was included on the compilation album, and later was featured on the iTunes Deluxe album of &quot;Grand National&quot;. Butler participated at the Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures located in Northeast Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.

==Jarrah ==
In July 2002, Jarrah Records was created by Butler, members of fellow Western Australian act The Waifs and their common manager, Phil Stevens. Being a partner in a record label allowed Butler to maximise artistic control of his recordings.

==Equipment and technique==
Butler plays harmonica, didgeridoo, drums, lap-steel, banjo and amplified acoustic guitars and his custom-made, 11-string Maton guitar. Butler prefers the Maton custom 11-string guitar and often uses a Seymour Duncan SA-6 Mag Mic pick-up with a Marshall Amplification JMP Super Lead Head and a Marshall 4×12 cabinet. He uses a variety of electronic effects including distortion, reverb / delay and wah-wah pedal to achieve his unique sound. Butler uses long, pointed fibreglass fingernails for finger picking. Ocean&#x27;s arrangement is similar to Salento pizzica.

==Political activism==

Butler is an advocate of peace, environmental protection, and global harmony. He has supported The Wilderness Society and the Save Ningaloo Reef campaign.

In 2005, Butler and Caruana co-founded the JB Seed grant program – renamed as The Seed in 2010 – to support artistic expression and encourage the &quot;social, cultural and artistic diversity in Australian society&quot;. The couple contributed $80,000 to establish the project. Other supporters include Paul Kelly, Correne Wilkie (Manager, The Cat Empire), Paul and Michelle Gilding (Ecoscorp), Maureen Ritchie, Missy Higgins, John Watson (Eleven Music), John Woodruff (JWM Productions), Sebastian Chase (MGM Distribution), Philip Stevens (Jarrah Records), The Waifs and Blue King Brown.

Butler is one of the largest supporters of the &quot;Save The Kimberley&quot; campaign in Australia and performed at the Save the Kimberley concert in Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s Federation Square in October 2012. On 4 October 2012, Butler was joined by 150 people during a protest outside the BHP Billiton headquarters in Melbourne; the protest was in response to the corporation&#x27;s involvement with a proposed James Price Point gas industrial complex in Western Australia&#x27;s Kimberley region.

Butler performed at another concert in support of the Kimberley cause on 24 February 2013, with Missy Higgins also appearing again, with the event held at The Esplanade in Fremantle, Western Australia. Jarrah Records, the record label that Butler co-founded with The Waifs and Phil Stevens, worked in partnership with The Wilderness Society to stage the free event that also featured the band Ball Park Music and Bob Brown, former leader of the Australian Greens. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards.

In response to the proposed dumping of around of dredged seabed onto the Great Barrier Reef, a legal fighting team was formed by World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) in late 2013/early 2014. The legal team received further support in April 2014, following the release of the &quot;Sounds for the Reef&quot; musical fundraising project. Produced by Straightup, the digital album features Butler, in addition to artists such as The Herd, Sietta, Missy Higgins, The Cat Empire, Fat Freddys Drop, The Bamboos (featuring Kylie Auldist) and Resin Dogs. Released on 7 April, the album&#x27;s 21 songs were sold on the Bandcamp website.

Butler is against Coal Seam Gas (CSG) and gave a free supporting concert at the Bentley protesting the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, Australia, on 20 April 2014.

Butler supports freedom of West Papua on Republic of Indonesia.

==Personal life==
Butler is married to Danielle Caruana, an Australian musician and vocalist who performs under the name of Mama Kin. They have two children, a daughter and a son. They also have an adopted son, Alex, who is also a musician.

After wearing dreadlocks for 13 years, Butler cut them off in early 2008. In an interview with the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper in 2008, Butler acknowledged that he had been referred to as the &quot;million dollar hippie&quot; in various articles and around his hometown in Australia. The nickname refers to his inclusion on the &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; list of the 50 richest entertainers in 2004, with reported earnings of A$2.4 million.

Prior to the release of the John Butler Trio&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, Butler explained:

I still care about everything I care about. But I don&#x27;t know how to write another song about a greedy arsehole ruining the planet. I have done it. I started writing about the damage of war and the environment, but as you drill down deeper, move closer to the core of the heart, there are so many great stories to be had which aren&#x27;t literally talking about a problem.

Butler also admitted to substance use: &quot;I&#x27;ve never had any big addictions. I feel like I might smoke pot a bit too much, and I&#x27;ve done cigarettes.&quot; He affirmed to his audience that he is &quot;normal&quot; and is &quot;going through all the same things&quot; they are, and he asked that he not be placed on a &quot;pedestal&quot;.

<text>The Patagones or Patagonian giants were a mythical race of giant humans rumoured to be living in Patagonia described in early European accounts. They were said to have exceeded at least double normal human height, with some accounts giving heights of or more. Tales of these people maintained a hold upon European conceptions of the region for nearly 300 years.

== History ==
The first mention of these people came from the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, who claimed to have seen them while exploring the coastline of South America en route to the Maluku Islands in their circumnavigation of the world in the 1520s. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the expedition&#x27;s few survivors and the chronicler of Magellan&#x27;s expedition, wrote in his account about their encounter with natives twice a normal person&#x27;s height:

Pigafetta also recorded that Magellan had bestowed on these people the name &quot;Patagão&quot; (i.e. &quot;Patagon&quot;, or &quot;Patagoni&quot; in Pigafetta&#x27;s Italian plural), but he did not further elaborate on his reasons for doing so. The original word would probably be in Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s native Portuguese (&quot;patagão&quot;) or the Spanish of his men (&quot;patagón&quot;). Since Pigafetta&#x27;s time the assumption that this derived from &quot;pata&quot; or foot took hold, and &quot;Patagonia&quot; was interpreted to mean &quot;Land of the Bigfeet&quot;. However, this etymology remains questionable, since amongst other things the meaning of the suffix &quot;-gon&quot; is unclear. It is now understood that the name comes from a character in &quot;Primaleón&quot;, a very popular 1512 Spanish chivalric romance novel, a type of fiction said to be widely read by Magellan and his conquistador colleagues. Nevertheless, the name &quot;Patagonia&quot; stuck, as did the notion that the local inhabitants were giants; maps of the New World of the time sometimes attached the label &quot;regio gigantum&quot; (&quot;region of giants&quot;) to the area.

In 1579, Francis Drake&#x27;s ship chaplain, Francis Fletcher, wrote about meeting very tall Patagonians, of &quot;7 foote and a halfe&quot;.

In the 1590s, Anthony Knivet claimed he had seen dead bodies long in Patagonia.

Also in the 1590s, William Adams, an Englishman aboard a Netherlander ship rounding Tierra del Fuego, reported a violent encounter between his ship&#x27;s crew and unnaturally tall natives.
The Dutch sailors Sebald de Weert in 1598, Olivier van Noort in 1599, and Joris van Spilbergen in 1615 claimed that giants were living in Patagonia. 

In 1766, a rumour leaked out upon their return to Great Britain that the crew of HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, captained by Commodore John Byron, had seen a tribe of natives in Patagonia when they passed by there on their circumnavigation of the globe. However, when a newly edited revised account of the voyage came out in 1773, the Patagonians were recorded as being —very tall, especially by 18th century standards, but by no means giants.

== Explanations ==
In 1615, a grave with bones of the giants in Puerto Deseado was reported by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire. This claim was possibly initiated by fossil finds.

Later writers consider the Patagonian giants to have been a hoax, or at least an exaggeration and misreporting of earlier European accounts of the region.

These accounts may also refer to the Selk&#x27;nam people. However, like that of the Tehuelche language, the language of the Selk&#x27;nam people does not match the records of the giant&#x27;s language that Magellan is claimed to have encountered. There is a photograph of a seven-foot tall Selk&#x27;nam (&quot;Ona&quot;) man in the US Library of Congress.

<text>East Saginaw was a city in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is now part of the city of Saginaw.

==History==
Much of the area that later became East Saginaw was granted by treaty to James Reilly, the Métis son of fur trader Stephen V. R. Reilly and his Chippewa wife, Men-aw-cum-ego-qua, considered the Pocahontas of the village.

In 1824, the American Fur company erected a log cabin where the Bancroft house now stands and in 1826 it was tenanted by Captain Leon Snay, a celebrated French hunter and trapper. In 1849, Charles W. Grant was the first permanent American settler here and he encouraged the building of the first school-house near Snay&#x27;s cabin in 1851.

There were three major fires in the history of East Saginaw. The first broke out in the kitchen of the Irving house on July 5, 1854, and spread throughout the village, destroying houses, mills, stores, and of lumber. In total $101,200 worth of damages, $80,000 of which was insured for $43,000. Two days prior, the first saw mill was destroyed with a $9,000 loss on the building in addition to of lumber valued at $6,000. The second fire started in the Jeffers’ block on Water street on May 7, 1861, and was too large by the time it was discovered. Twenty-three buildings and property valued at $55,000 were destroyed, insured for $17,500. Despite the village burning down twice, the settlers remained, stubbornly rebuilding it once again. The third fire started in the wholesale liquor store on Washington Street on January 26, 1865, and spread rapidly to every building for an aggregated $125,000 worth of damages.

East Saginaw was settled in 1850, and was incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1859. On June 2, 1889, the Michigan State Legislature passed an act to consolidate the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City, Michigan (the west side of the Saginaw River) to form the present-day city of Saginaw, which became effective with the election of officers for the consolidated city in March 1890.

<text>Gorkamorka is a tabletop skirmish wargame produced by Games Workshop. It is set on the desert world of Angelis in the Warhammer 40,000 setting, and prominently features Orks.

The player takes control of a group of warriors with the objective to gain wealth and experience. The rules are derived from the second edition of Warhammer 40,000, with extra vehicle rules and an extensive campaign system added. In 1998 it received an expansion set, &quot;Digganob&quot;, which introduced additional playable factions, special characters, and scenarios.

In 2008 the rule book and source book for Gorkamorka were released on the Games Workshop website under the &quot;Out of Print Games&quot; section. The expansion set was not released in the same way.

A video game based on Gorkamorka was also being developed for Windows and the Dreamcast, but was scrapped shortly before the latter system was discontinued.

==Background==
Aeons ago a Space Hulk filled with Orks on a Waaagh! (a huge Ork invasion) crashed into Angelis plowing a massive canyon, &quot;Da Skid&quot;, and devastating the world&#x27;s ecosystem. The Orks, a race who can survive just about any catastrophe, promptly decided that this was not the Waaagh! and resolved to find a way off-world as quickly as possible. They turned to their Mekboyz (Ork technicians, engineers, mechanics and the closest thing they have to scientists) for aid, who set the other Orks to work gathering up wreckage from the crash. Construction began on a huge machine, although what it was going to do differed depending on the ideas of the individual Mekboy.

The lack of unity in the construction and the machine&#x27;s resemblance to a religious idol led to conflict amongst the Ork population. A religious schism occurred and factions formed based around whether believers felt the idol was of the Ork god Gork or Mork. The resulting violence destroyed the entire machine, forcing the Meks to broker an unsteady peace between the warring sides. From then on the machine would be known as Gorkamorka, at least until the day of completion.

Angelis was a suspected Necron tombworld, prompting Imperial efforts to assess the planet. At the time of the crash there were surveyors underground within the pyramids, an Imperial outpost, and an Imperial cruiser in orbit. The cruiser was brought down by the hulk with the disfigured descendants of the crash survivors became &quot;Muties&quot;, while those inside the pyramids became primitive tribals known as &quot;Diggas&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to lead a group of warriors to fame and fortune within the setting. Players choose from a range of factions with varying motivations and abilities and fight battles against others. Most of these groups are between five and fifteen fighters with appropriate transport, known as a &quot;mob&quot;. Battles take place in an assortment of locations and scenarios, including sieges, races, and rescue missions.

Games are designed to be played in a series and form a campaign, wherein fighters gain new abilities and suffer permanent battle injuries or death, and new warriors are purchased, or &quot;retire&quot; once they get to too high of a level. Players earn money (&quot;Teef&quot;) based on how well they perform and the relative strength of their opponents. The campaigns are designed to be open-ended, allowing new players to join and leave at any time thanks to a mechanic which adjusts the rewards players receive evening out the power disparity. The closest thing to winning a campaign would be reaching the &quot;retirement&quot; level before other players.

==Mob types==
; Orks : A fungus/algal-based race whose culture revolves around war, Orks are the most common species in the universe of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. They are split into two factions, Gorkers and Morkers. Gorkers favour brutal weaponry while Morkers favour enhancing their vehicles.
; Diggas : Tribal humans, descendants of an Imperial surveying team.
; Rebel Grots : A sub-set of the orkoid species similar to goblins.
; Muties : Mutants originating from the shipwrecked crew of the survey team&#x27;s orbiting vessel.

==Community creations==
Since the release of the rulebook PDFs on the Games Workshop site in 2008 the community surrounding Gorkamorka has grown substantially online resulting in the creation of a large volume of fan-made content. Several community created mob types have been added to the game:
;Feral Orks : Primitive Orks with no access to higher technology, relying instead on squigs, squiggoths, and psychic powers.
;Freebooters : Orks who have no affiliation with Gorkers or Morkers, preferring instead to live as pirates and mercenaries.
;The Dust Rats : Humans trapped within the Imperial surveyors&#x27; outpost at the time of the space hulk&#x27;s crash. Best described as somewhere between a militia and the Imperial Guard.
;Snortaz : Orks who eschew vehicles in favour of large boars.
;Dark Eldar : A cruel and technologically advanced race from the Warhammer 40K universe.

==Bibliography==

==Reception==
The French games magazine &quot;Backstab&quot; was less than impressed with this game, complaining that the rules appeared to be a simple cut and paste from previous products. The game was given a poor rating of only 5 out of 10 with the comment, &quot;We were expecting vehicle rules &quot;à la &quot;Car Wars&quot;&quot; just to feel the wind in our hair, but we end up with slow trucks and tracks whose movement is so random that now you have to be as lucky during the movement phase as you are during combat. It&#x27;s funny, completely chaotic but... a bit boring. No?&quot;

The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; #29 (Jan./Feb., 1998) stated that &quot;First off, let me just say that if you&#x27;re a member of the Green Party (by which I mean an adherent to all things Orcish and Gobliny), &quot;Gorkamorka&quot; is a game you&#x27;re gonna go ape, er, Ork over.&quot;

<doc id="1133768" wikidata="Q324589" url="?curid=1133768" title="Club Atlético Lanús">
<text>Club Atlético Lanús () is an Argentine sports club based in Lanús, a city of the Buenos Aires Province. Founded in 1915, the club&#x27;s main sports are football and basketball. In both sports, Lanús plays in Argentina&#x27;s top divisions: Primera División (football) and Liga Nacional de Básquet (basketball). Domestic football major titles won by the club include two Primera División championships, the Copa Bicentenario and one Supercopa Argentina. At international level, Lanús has won one Copa CONMEBOL, and one Copa Sudamericana.

The so-called &quot;Southern Classic&quot; (&quot;Clásico del Sur&quot;), considered a modern classic in Argentine football, is contested against &quot;Banfield&quot;, and thanks to the good results of both in recent years it is also considered one of the most attractive clásicos of Primera División.

Apart from football, Lanús hosts many other sports such as athletics, gymnastics, martial arts, handball, field hockey, roller skating, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and weightlifting. Besides, the club has a futsal team in Colombia that was founded in 2011.

==History==

===Origins and foundation===

In 1854 Anacarsis Lanús arrived from France and acquired the lands where he would later establish the city of Lanús, one of the biggest suburbs of Greater Buenos Aires. Two institutions were named &quot;Lanús&quot; by that time. One of them was Lanús Athletic Club, which took part of the 1897 Argentine Primera División championship although the club then abandoned the tournament. The other club was Lanús United (predecessor of current Club Atlético Lanús) which participated in the Copa de Competencia, organised by dissident Federación Argentina de Football in 1913 and 1914.

On 3 January 1915, a new club was established from the merging of two institutions, Lanús United (that was in a desperate financial situation) and Club El Progreso. Miguel Usaray was designed as president, the first in the history of the club. In an assemble held on 27 January 1915, the name &quot;Club Atlético Lanús&quot; was officially established.

===Debut in Primera: the 1920s===
The club began to play its matches in División Intermedia (the second division of Argentine football league system by then) at Lanús United old stadium, located in Margarita Wield and General Deheza streets. In 1919 the club got promotion to the top division, Primera División, after beating Argentino de Quilmes. In the first division, Lanús played its first games in the official association, then switching to dissident Asociación Amateurs de Football (AAmF), where the team joined on 8 August 1920, when the squad was defeated by Racing Club by 1–0. That first season in the top division Lanús finished 11th of 20th.
During successive years, Lanús did not achieve great campaigns in Primera, even finishing last in 1923. That season the squad only achieved two wins and lost 14 games of 20. In 1926 Lanús finished 6th and the 1927 season the team finished 3rd to San Lorenzo and Boca Juniors. Lanús earned 50 points with 22 wins over 33 matches played, being defeated 5 times.

On 24 February 1929 Lanús opened its new stadium in the intersection of Héctor Guidi and General Arias streets. The stadium (with wood stands as it was usual for that time) was built on a 50,000 m2 land given by the British-owned company Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (&quot;Ferrocarril del Sud&quot;. Then president of the club, Silvio Peri, made the arrangements to get the cession did not have any cost for the institution, at least for the first years. On 24 March 1929 Lanús played its first match there facing Platense, defeating it by 5–2.

=== The &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s ===
In 1931 football became professional in Argentina. Lanús did not make a good campaign, finishing penultimate achieving only 22 points, 28 less than champion Boca Juniors. One year later the club inaugurated a new grandstand in its stadium. The first version of the Lanús Anthem, composed by Domingo Ilvento (music) and Daniel Cao (lyrics) was also released.

In 1933 founding member Miguel Iguzguiza made the arrangements to acquire the lands where the new headquarters would be built, on José C. Paz avenue (current 9 de Julio avenue). This was approved in a meeting held on 23 December. One year later the Association obliged both Club Lanús and rival team Talleres de Remedios de Escalada to join in order to play the tournament under the name &quot;Unión Talleres-Lanús&quot;, threatening them to be relegated if they did not accept. This fusion was ended in 1935 when both clubs played again separately.

Some of the most notable players of those years were Atilio Ducca (the most capped player in Lanús&#x27; history with 291 games). In 1939 forward Luis Arrieta came to the club, scoring 31 goals during his first season with the club. Arrieta was also the top-scorer in 1943 along with Ángel Labruna (River Plate) and Raúl Frutos (Platense). Arrieta would later become the all-time top scorer of Lanús, with 120 goals.

Lanús remained in Primera until 1949 when the team was relegated after a controversial decision from the Association. At the end of the tournament, Boca Juniors was placed last and Lanús penultimate. On 8 December Boca smashed Lanús by 5–1, which finished last along with Huracán. In order to define which team would be relegated, Lanús and Huracán had to play a relegation series. Huracán won the first game 1–0 and Lanús took revenge by 4–1 in the second match so a third game was played. With a partial score of 3–3 the referee awarded a penalty kick to Lanús. The Huracán players, in disagreement with the decision, abandoned the field being the match suspended. The Argentine Association not only did not punished Huracán but it decided to play a new match. During that fourth game the referee did not award a penalty kick to Lanús while Huracán was winning the match by 3–2. As a result, the Lanús players left the field (as their rivals had done before). But the Association decided to punish Lanús relegating the club to Primera B.

===Return to Primera===

After the controversial decision made by the AFA, Lanús played the 1950 season in the second division. With still 1 fixture to play, Lanús won the championship when the team defeated Argentinos Juniors by 3–1 therefore promoting to Primera División. In Primera B, Lanús played 22 matches with 15 wins and 3 losses. The team achieved large victories over El Porvenir (5–1), Colón (4–2), Temperley (4–1 and 4–0), Argentinos Juniors (4–0), Unión de Santa Fe (6–1) and Nueva Chicago (6–1). The line-up for the game that set up the return to Primera was: Alvarez Vega; Daponte, Mercado; Vargas, Strembel, Vivas; Contreras, Gil, Pairoux, Florio, Moyano. Former Boca Juniors coach Mario Fortunato led the team to the title.

===&quot;The Globetrotters&quot;===

Back in the top division, Lanús would be the sensation of 1951 championship, finishing the first round in the 1st place along with Independiente. Forward José Florio was the top scorer with 21 goals, having been sold to Italian club Torino for a record $ 1,500,000. The club later used the money to build a gym.

Lanús finished 5th in 1954 and 1955. One year later Lanús would achieve its best performance in Primera División until then, finishing 2nd. to River Plate. Due to an outstanding line of forwards (that scored 49 goals in 30 games) and their skills with the ball, that squad was nicknamed &quot;The Globetrotters&quot; honoring the famous basketball team. The team suffered a lot of injuries all season long, with only Dante Lugo playing all matches. The usual team was Vega; Prato, Beltrán; Daponte, Hector Guidi, Nazionale; Carranza, Lugo, Alfredo Rojas, Urbano Reynoso, Moyano.

The &quot;Globetrotters&quot; thrashed their rivals with large victories over Argentinos Juniors (4–0), Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata (5–3), San Lorenzo (4–0) and Huracán (4–2). Nevertheless, the team was beaten by 3–1 by River Plate, that would be later the champion. River Plate squad had players with less individual skills than Lanús&#x27;, but they were more experienced and those qualities helped them to get the championship at the end of the season.

===The &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s===

After some very irregular performances in Primera División, Lanús was relegated in 1961. The team finished 12th of 24th but it was relegated (along with Los Andes) due to the league system calculated the average during the last three championships (1959, 1960, 1961).

Three years later Lanús won the Primera B title, returning to Primera División. The two forwards of the team, Manuel Silva and Bernardo Acosta, soon got recognition due to the famous &quot;wall pass&quot; they did together, being nicknamed &quot;&quot;Los Albañiles&quot; (&quot;The Construction Workers)&quot;.

In 1966 Héctor Guidi, one of the most notable players in club&#x27;s history, left football. Three years later Acosta would be transfer to Sevilla. Manuel Silva moved to his new club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in 1970, finishing with the &quot;Albañiles&quot; era. That same year the team was relegated to the second division (along with Unión de Santa Fe) after finishing 7th of 7 in the &quot;Torneo reclasificatorio&quot;.

In 1971 Guidi became manager and Lanús started a new season in Primera B. The team made a great campaign winning a new title in second division and therefore promoting to Primera División. Lanús played a total of 28 games, winning 17 with 4 losses. The squad scored 68 goals and received 31. Unfortunately for the club, the tenure of Lanús on 1972 Primera División season was the worst in its history, being relegated again at the end of the championship.

===The worst crisis===
Four years later, Lanús returned to Primera after winning the promotion tournament. Once more, the team remained a very short time in Primera so Lanús was relegated after the 1977 season. Lanús was relegated after a controversial decision by penalty kicks in a match against Platense. After 20 penalties shot by all outfield players, it was the goalkeepers&#x27; turn. The Lanús goalkeeper shot first, but missed. It was the Platense goalkeeper&#x27;s turn, but instead, Platense striker Miguel Ángel Juárez took it, breaking the rules. The referee allowed the goal, and Lanús were relegated illegitimately. The club reclaimed, but the Argentine football association did not respond.

In Primera B Lanús had a very poor season and was eventually relegated to the Third Division (Primera C). With debts of over US$2 million, the club faced its worst crisis. By 1979 the club only had 2,000 members facing its first season in the Third Division. The political groups linked with the club&#x27;s debts decided to forget its differences with the club and helped the club face forward.

Lanús won the 1981 Primera C title various fixtures before the season ended. The club, with help from the fans, was promoted to the Second Division once again having more than 10,000 members. In 1984 the team reached the semifinals of the promotion playoff to the First Division, when the team had to face Racing Club. In the first leg, Racing Club beat Lanús 2–0. In the second leg, played in Independiente&#x27;s stadium, the referee gave Racing Club a controversial penalty kick after disallowing a Lanús goal. Racing Club scored a goal, but the match was eventually suspended because of Lanús&#x27; fans. The match was continued at Atlanta&#x27;s stadium some days after, and Lanús were down 2–1 after dominating the game. The referee, Emilio Misic, mistakenly gave the final whistle 5 minutes before the end of regulation. The Racing Club players already started celebrating, so the referee used that excuse not to reverse the decision. Lanús was once again disadvantaged because of a referee error, therefore losing the series and failing to gain promotion to the First Division.

Already having more than 25,000 members, the team was promoted to the Second Division in 1986. With Miguel Ángel Russo as manager, the team returned to the First Division after 13 years. Thanks to the team&#x27;s goalkeeper, Alcides Herrera, the team beat Quilmes in the finals of the promotion playoff. The club also started to repair the old stadium made of wood. Lanús made a poor campaign in Primera División being relegated to Primera B Nacional (the second division since 1986). The club&#x27;s executives decided to keep Miguel Ángel Russo as manager, regardless of relegation.

===The resurrection: the 1990s===
Lanús returned to the top division on 24 May 1992, when more than 30,000 supporters saw how Lanús beat Deportivo Maipú 2–0 winning the 1991–92 Primera B Nacional title. The line-up for the final was Ojeda, Gómez, Agüero, Mainardi, González; H. Enrique, Kuzemka, Schurrer, Angelello; Gambier, Villagrán, with Russo as manager. At the end of the season, Lanús had totalized 57 points in 42 games, with 21 wins and 6 losses, scoring a total of 64 goals and receiving 34.

The good campaign of the team during the 1993 Apertura allowed it to qualify for the Copa CONMEBOL, where Lanús participated for the first time in an international tournament. The team was eventually eliminated by San Lorenzo in the quarter-finals. On 1 October, Ariel Ibagaza made his debut for the team, where he and Hugo Morales formed a midfield duo highly praised by Lanús&#x27; fans.

In 1995 Héctor Cúper took charge of the team at the start of the Apertura. Lanús finished 3rd by goal difference and points. The next year turned out to be one of the club&#x27;s most important. Lanús brought in Claudio Enría from Newell&#x27;s and Gonzalo Belloso. In the Clausura, Lanús eventually finished 3rd. In the second spell of the year, the club brought in Oscar Mena, Gustavo Falaschi and Gustavo Siviero. Lanús had to face two tournaments at once for the first time in their history, the local tournament and the Copa CONMEBOL. In the local tournament, they finished 3rd once again.

===International success===
In 1996 Lanús won the Copa CONMEBOL, a tournament created in 1992. The team eliminated Bolívar in the first stage (4–1, 0–1), then passed Guaraní (2–0, 6–2). In semi-finals defeated Rosario Central (3–0, 3–1) reaching the finals against Independiente Santa Fe of Colombia. In the first leg, Lanús won 2–0. In the second leg, Lanús lost 1–0, resulting in an aggregate score of 2–1, which made Lanús champion. It was Lanús&#x27; first major and international title. The line-up for the final match was: Roa; Serrizuela, Falaschi, Siviero, Bresen; Mena, Cravero, Ibagaza, Coyette; Enría, Ariel López. With Mario Gómez as head coach, Lanús also reached the cup final in 1997 but was defeated by Brazilian team Atlético Mineiro (1–4, 1–1).

In 1998, Lanús finished 2nd once more with 40 points behind Vélez Sarsfield, which to date being the club&#x27;s best campaign in terms of points. Four years later Lanús had to play a relegation playoff versus Huracán de Tres Arroyos, winning 2–1 in Platense&#x27;s stadium and drawing 1–1 in their stadium. With an aggregate score of 3–2 in favor, Lanús remained in Primera División.

===First national title===
In 2003 the stadium repairs were finished. Three years later, with a team based from its youth divisions, Lanús was the runner-up of Torneo Clausura. In 2007 the club got qualification for the 2nd time in a row to the Copa Sudamericana and -for the first time in club&#x27;s history- to the Copa Libertadores.

Lanús also won its first Primera División title, the 2007 Apertura, being coached by Ramón Cabrero. Lanús celebrated in the 18th fixture with a 1–1 tie to Boca Juniors at La Bombonera. The line-up for that match was: Bossio; Graieb, Ribonetto, Hoyos, Velázquez; Blanco, Pelletieri, Fritzler, Valeri; Acosta, Sand. The squad totalized 38 points in 19 matches, with Sand as the topscorer of the tournament with 15 goals.

The next year Lanús participated in the 2008 Copa Libertadores, finishing unbeaten in the first stage. In the second round, Lanús was eliminated by Mexican Atlas. In domestic competitions, Lanús once again finished sub-champions of 2011 Clausura, behind Vélez Sarsfield.

===Successful 2010&#x27;s decade===
Lanús qualified to play the 2012 Copa Libertadores, where the squad got its biggest win in international competitions in history (6–0 against Paraguayan Olimpia in La Fortaleza). The team led by Gabriel Schürrer won its group and reached the round of 16, where it was eliminated by Vasco Da Gama in penalty shootout.

In 2013, Lanús obtained its second international title, the Copa Sudamericana after beating Brazilian club Ponte Preta in the finals.
In May 2016, Lanús won its second league title, the 2016 Primera División after thrashing San Lorenzo by 4–0 in the final match played at River Plate stadium. The goals were scored by Junior Benítez, Miguel Almirón, José Sand and Lautaro Acosta. The line-up for the match was Fernando Monetti; José Luis Gómez, Gustavo Gómez, Diego Braghieri,Maximiliano Velázquez; Román Martínez, Iván Marcone, Miguel Almirón; Oscar Benítez, José Sand,Lautaro Acosta. The squad was coached by Jorge Almirón.

On 31 October 2017, the club advanced for the first time in its history to the 2017 Copa Libertadores final, after completing a historic feat, defeating fellow Argentine club River Plate by 4–3 on aggregate in the semi-finals, when they were out 3–0 before the end of the first half in the second leg. They lost the final to Grêmio in both legs.

=== 2020s ===
In October 2024, the Argentine Association officialised a championship won by Lanús in 1955, the Copa Juan Domingo Perón, organised by the body and the Government of Buenos Aires Province together. AFA included this competition (held only once) in its list of official domestic cups After this decision, Lanús totalised seven official titles through its history.

<text>Marion Mahony Griffin (; February 14, 1871 – August 10, 1961) was an American architect and artist. She was one of the first licensed female architects in the world, and is considered an original member of the Prairie School. Her work in the United States developed and expanded the American Prairie School, and her work in India and Australia reflected Prairie School ideals of indigenous landscape and materials in newly formed democracies. The scholar Debora Wood stated that Griffin &quot;did the drawings people think of when they think of Frank Lloyd Wright (one of her collaborating architects).&quot; According to architecture critic, Reyner Banham, Griffin was &quot;America’s (and perhaps the world’s) first woman architect who needed no apology in a world of men.&quot;

She produced some of the finest architectural drawing in America and Australia, and was instrumental in envisioning the design plans for the capital city of Australia, Canberra. Towards the end of her life, she wrote &quot;The Magic of America,&quot; an autobiography accompanied with various illustrations dedicated toward showcasing her life&#x27;s work and values&quot;.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Mahony was born in 1871 in Chicago, Illinois, to Jeremiah Mahony, a journalist, poet, and teacher from Cork, Ireland, and Clara Hamilton, a schoolteacher. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1880, her family moved North of Chicago to nearby Winnetka. Scholars note that it is very likely that her family was heavily involved in the intellectual and Unitarian community there at the time, as both her parents were deeply ambitious about education and art. Winnetka&#x27;s Unitarian Chapel often held discussions about the arts, politics, and social issues heavily revolving around democracy. Mahony often recalled her childhood in Winnetka in her autobiography, &quot;The Magic of America&quot;, describing how she had become fascinated by the freeing nature and quickly disappearing landscape as suburban homes filled the area.At the time, Winnetka was known to be more &quot;like a pioneer town than a suburb.&quot; This landscape inspired Mahony&#x27;s focus on nature in her architectural practices, and her family&#x27;s involvement in the intellectual community further influenced her democratic principles and philosophy.

After Mahony&#x27;s father died by suicide in 1882, her mother decided to move out of Winnetka to the West Side of Chicago where she became an elementary school principal in a Chicago Public School to support her children. Her mother became a pioneer in public education, and was involved in many women&#x27;s groups across the city. Mahony described her mother as &quot;the most democratic of human beings&quot;, firsthand seeing her involvement with many social reformers, activists, artists, and intellectuals. She grew up with a range of female role models in Chicago. Anna Wilmarth, who was part of their inner circles personally funded Mahony&#x27;s education at the Massuchusetts Institute of Technology after she was influenced by her cousin, architect Dwight Perkins, to pursue an architectural degree. After Sophia Hayden, Mahony was the second woman to have studied architecture and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1894.

==Architectural career==
=== Start of her career ===
After completing her degree at MIT, Mahony returned to Chicago and started her professional career at her cousin, Dwight Perkins&#x27; practice in Chicago’s Steinway Hall, a shared office of more progressive artists and architects during the time. Perkins himself was a former MIT student, however he never completed his architectural degree. Although Mahony was more educated than him, he fostered the significant improvement of her drafting and design skills as she gained hands-on experience. Subsequently, she became the first licensed female architect in Illinois in 1898. Through Perkins, Mahony met Frank Lloyd Wright. She was later hired and worked with Wright from 1895-1909 in both Chicago and his Oak Park studio. She went to work designing buildings, furniture, stained glass windows, and decorative panels. Barry Byrne, a coworker of Mahony&#x27;s described her as “the most talented member of Frank Lloyd Wright’s staff.&quot;

=== Approach to architecture ===
From the progressive educational philosophies, and inner circles of women and social reformers that she was exposed to from a young age, Mahony&#x27;s values heavily revolved around collaboration and spilled into most of her architectural work. In a field of competitive individualists, she saw architecture as a collective endeavor. In her autobiography she emphasized the advantages of working together, especially in creating spaces that were meant to bring people together. Further, her philosophy, reflecting the later formed Prairie School ideals, was rooted in the human relationship to nature and democracy. Almost always, she integrated architecture with the natural world, creating perspectives of landscapes working together with structures in her renderings. In her autobiography, her biggest discussions were centered around democracy, character, integrity, and the right to artistic expression. 

=== Greatest contributions ===
Although Mahony was considered an illustrator or delineator of the work of other architects, her &quot;rich and fruitful&quot; graphic representation and style combined perspective, plan, and section on one sheet for the first time.Through this original style, Mahony challenged traditional rendering conventions during the time. She combined art and architecture in her draftsmanship, and was known to have an &quot;exceptional feel&quot; for linear compositions that integrated architecture with nature. Her interest in Japanese prints gave her several unique compositional techniques of color, depth, emphasis, and line weight that played a crucial role in the development of the Prairie School. This new presentation of designs was revolutionary in presenting architectural work to the world. Mahony&#x27;s work became a powerful marketing tool, that enabled conversations with clients as they had become able to visualize the plans presented.

In the fifteen years that Mahony had worked for Wright, she was an important contributor to his reputation and brand identity, particularly to the influential &quot;Wasmuth Portfolio&quot;, for which Mahony had &quot;contributed nearly half [of the drawings] which appear attributable.&quot; Her rendering of the K. C. DeRhodes House in South Bend, Indiana, in particular, was praised by Wright and many critics. Her presentation drawing of the home was exceptionally skillful with clear-cut lines, and her original use of stylized trees and flowers to frame the structure. The foliage was just as sharp as the structure presented, further highlighting her integration of architecture with the natural world. 

=== Lack of credit ===
Wright understated the contributions of others of the Prairie School, Mahony included. A clear understanding of Marion Mahony&#x27;s contribution to the architecture of the Oak Park Studio comes from Wright&#x27;s son, John Lloyd Wright, who says that William Drummond, Francis Barry Byrne, Walter Burley Griffin, Albert Chase McArthur, Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts, and George Willis were the draftsmen—the five men and two women who each made valuable contributions to Prairie-style architecture for which Wright became famous. Her beautiful watercolor renderings of buildings and landscapes became known as a staple of Wright&#x27;s style, though she was never given credit by the famous architect. For example, Wright &quot;desperately&quot; tried to attribute the K. C. DeRhodes House to himself. He annotated the rendering writing &quot;after FLLW and Hiroshige&quot;. Yet, Mahony&#x27;s initials, &quot;MLM&quot;, were included in very small print under the foliage of the rendering.

=== Mid-late career ===
When Wright eloped to Europe with Mamah Borthwick Cheney in 1909, he offered the Studio&#x27;s work to Mahony but she declined. It is unclear whether Mahony had a positive or negative perception of Wright after having worked with him. In her autobiography she wrote, &quot;The Chicago school died not only because of the cancer sore in it - one who originated very little but spent most of his time claiming everything and swiping everything.&quot; Research notes suggest that Mahony was referring to Wright however, she never explicitly made negative claims about him. 
After Wright had gone, Hermann V. von Holst, who had taken on Wright&#x27;s commissions, hired Mahony with the stipulation that she would have control of the design. In this capacity, Mahony was the architect for a number of commissions Wright had abandoned. Two examples were the first (unbuilt) design for Henry Ford&#x27;s Dearborn mansion, Fair Lane and the &quot;Amberg House&quot; in Grand Rapids, Michigan. During this time, Mahony recommended Walter Burley Griffin to von Holst to develop landscaping for the area surrounding the three houses commissioned from Wright in Decatur, Illinois. Griffin was a fellow architect, a fellow ex-employee of Wright, and a leading member of the Prairie School of architecture. 

Mahony and Griffin worked on the Decatur project before their marriage in 1911; afterward, Mahony worked in Griffin&#x27;s practice. The two of them, developed the largest collection of Prairie Style homes surrounding a natural setting. They collaborated on various projects across the United States, Australia, and India. Mahony produced a visual solution to Griffin&#x27;s renderings with the use the combination of illustration and elevation that created a totally new method of presentation. Architectural historians such as Thomas S. Hines, note that Mahony&#x27;s watercolor perspectives of Griffins&#x27; design for Canberra, the new Australian capital, were instrumental in securing first prize in the international competition for the plan of the city. However, deeply rooted in her collaborative approach, she would publicly refer to her contributions as &quot;our projects&quot;, often making note of the love and loyalty she had for her husband. 

When Walter Burley Griffin was appointed Director of Design and Construction of Canberra in 1914, the couple moved to Australia to oversee the building of Canberra. Mahony managed the Sydney office and was responsible for the design of their private commissions. Cafe Australia, Newman College, and the Capitol Theatre were three architectural structures worked on by Mahony, and for which the couple hired local artists, including Bertha Merfield, in whose friendship Marion shared an interest in the decorative potential of the eucalyptus form, which they sketched together around Tasmania. Marion&#x27;s memoirs record the rough journey across Bass Strait in the SS &quot;Loongana&quot;, compensated over December 1918–January 1919 with &#x27;a wonderful fortnight which enabled me to add a number of unique trees to my set of Forest Portraits.&#x27;

In Australia, Mahony and Griffin was introduced to Anthroposophy and the ideas of Rudolf Steiner which they embraced enthusiastically, and in Sydney they joined the Anthroposophy Society. These would later have a great influence on her autobiography. In Australia, they pioneered the Knitlock construction method, inexactly emulated by Wright in his California textile block houses of the 1920s. Following the completion of the construction of the Capitol Theatre in 1924, Marion and her husband moved to Castlecrag and furthered its community development.

Later in 1936, Mahony Griffin traveled to India to work in her husband&#x27;s practice in Lucknow. Little is known about her full function in the Lucknow office, however from writings between Walter Burley Griffin and his draftsmen Mr. Halder, it&#x27;s clear that she took on the role of managing the office, training, and supervising the student draftsmen. In a manuscript of the letter between the two included in &quot;The Magic of America&quot;, Mr. Halder stated, &quot;Marion is working like a slave and she is the only effective help I have had for this exhibition.&quot; In addition to this, she continued drafting and illustrating in her unique graphic style, yet it&#x27;s hard to attribute which of her works belonged to her when both her and her husband signed their initials on them. Lucknow reinvigorated her interest in architecture as she finished the rendering of the library and museum for Raja of Mahmudabad as Walter Burley Griffin lied on his death bed. Her artistic approach in this piece was deemed to be an evolution of the renderings she had produced earlier. It was not only an expression of the building, but a work of graphic art that shared characteristics with the rendering of the DeRhodes house.
==Death and legacy==
Marion Mahony Griffin did not stay long in Australia after Walter&#x27;s death. By then in her late 60s, she returned to the United States and afterward was largely retired from her architectural career. &quot;The one time she addressed the Illinois Society of Architects, she made no mention of her work, instead lectured the crowd on anthroposophy.&quot;

She did however spend the next twenty years working on a massive volume of 1,400 pages and 650 illustrations detailing her and Walter&#x27;s working lives, which she titled &quot;The Magic of America&quot;, which has yet to be formally published in book form. A manuscript deposited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 was digitized, and since 2007 has been available online. In 2006 the National Library of Australia acquired a large collection of the Griffins&#x27; work including drawings, photographs, silk paintings and ephemera from the descendants of the Griffins’ Australian partner Eric Milton Nicholls.

Battling memory loss toward the end of her life, Marion Mahony Griffin died in poverty in 1961 at the age of 90. She was buried in Graceland Cemetery.

=== Public memory ===
Following her death, Marion Mahony Griffin was often only seen for her supporting role in the lives of Frank Lloyd Wright and her husband, Walter Burley Griffin. Despite her commentary on designs, compiled papers, and personal writings, her individual and unique contributions to the field were described as being &#x27;for&#x27; other architects she worked with. Many of her renderings were captioned with being &quot;for Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; or &quot;for Walter Burley Griffin.&quot; Over the years historians and scholars were consistently misinformed about her. Her name was often misspelled, and the discourse surrounding her name often went out of its way to describe her physical features rather than her work. She was often ridiculed for her late marriage to Griffin, and said she &quot;lacked most feminine graces.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until later, that early characterizations of her were left behind, and she had begun to get credited for her work. Over a century later she would be known the &quot;greatest architectural delineator of her generation&quot; by architectural writer Reyner Banham. Although during her life, her talent was seen as only an extension of the work done by male architects, recent architectural historians now credit at least half of the drawings in Wright’s portfolio, &quot;Ausgeführte Bauten und Entwürfe, von Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;, “one of the three most influential architectural treatises of the twentieth century,&quot; to Mahony. 

In 2015, the beach at Jarvis Avenue in Rogers Park, Chicago was named in Mahony Griffin&#x27;s honor. When she returned to the United States in 1939, after her husband&#x27;s death, she lived near the beach. The Australian Consul-General, Roger Price, attended the beach&#x27;s dedication for the woman who was instrumental in the design the Australian capital.

Among the few works attributed to Mahony that survive in the United States is a small mural in George B. Armstrong elementary school in Chicago, and some of the home she had designed in Decatur, Illinois.

The Australian Institute of Architects, NSW Chapter, honored her work with an annual award, the Marion Mahony Griffin Prize, for a distinctive body of work by a female architect for architectural education, journalism, research, theory, a professional practice or built architectural work.

<text>General Charles Foulkes, (3 January 1903 – 12 September 1969) was a Canadian soldier, and an officer of The Royal Canadian Regiment.

==Military career==
One of eight children, Foulkes was born in Stockton-on-Tees, England, on 3 January 1903. His family moved to Canada, eventually settling at 230 Hill Street in London, Ontario. He completed his secondary school education at the London Collegiate Institute (now Central Secondary School) before going to the University of Western Ontario.

He joined the Canadian Militia in 1926. In 1937 he attended the Staff College in Camberley, England. His report concluded that he was, &quot;Sound and competent, and possessed of drive and determination.&quot;

At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Foulkes was serving as a major with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. He went on to be a General Staff Officer with 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. After serving as the 3rd Brigade&#x27;s commander from August 1942, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division in January 1944 and led the division through the Normandy Campaign. In November 1944 he was made General Officer Commanding I Canadian Corps in Italy before it returned to Northwest Europe in early 1945. He received rapid promotion during the war, rising from major in 1939 to lieutenant-general in 1944.

On 4 May 1945, south of Hamburg, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery accepted the unconditional surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany including all islands, in Denmark and all naval ships in those areas. The surrender preceded the end of World War II in Europe and was signed in a carpeted tent at Montgomery&#x27;s headquarters on the Timeloberg hill at Wendisch Evern.

On 5 May 1945, Foulkes summoned German General Blaskowitz to the Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen to discuss the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands. His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard, acting as commander in chief of the Dutch Interior Forces, attended the meeting as well. Blaskowitz agreed with all of the proposals made by Foulkes. However, nowhere in the building – some sources claim: nowhere in the whole town – could a typewriter be found. Thus the surrender document could not be typed. The next day, 6 May, both parties returned, and in the presence of both General Foulkes and Prince Bernhard, Blaskowitz signed the surrender document which in the meantime had been typed.

After the war, Foulkes was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS) and, in 1951, the year he was promoted to full general, the first Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. General Guy Simonds as army chief clashed with Foulkes about where to station the newly-envisaged Canadian force in West Germany. The continentalist Foulkes, who wanted to move Canada closer to the United States, wanted the Canadians to serve with the U.S Army forces in southern West Germany. Simonds by contrast argued that for historical reasons the Canadians should serve with the British forces in northern West Germany, arguing that the Canadians would fight better with them if the Soviet Ground Forces and their Eastern European satellites should invade West Germany. Simonds stated that the Canadians had fought alongside the British successively in the Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean War, and moreover the Canadian Army was closely modelled after the British Army right down to having British-style uniforms and ranks and the same regimental structure; for all these reasons, Simonds felt that placing the Canadians with the British in northern West Germany would be a better fit. As the Canadian decision-makers had been &quot;shocked by the American performance in Korea&quot; while the British forces fighting in Korea had fought well, Simonds won the debate and it was agreed that the Canadians would serve as part of the British Army of the Rhine, though Foulkes was able to ensure the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) units would serve with the United States Air Force instead of the Royal Air Force.

Foulkes retired in 1960.

In 1968 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He taught at Carleton University in 1968 and 1969. He died in Ottawa in 1969.

His medals and other personal artifacts are on display at the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario. He was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Western Ontario on 11 June 1947.

<doc id="1133782" wikidata="Q152626" url="?curid=1133782" title="Attica (wife of Agrippa)">
<text>Attica (born ca 58–51 BC, perhaps died around 32–29 BC) was the daughter of Cicero&#x27;s Epicurean friend Titus Pomponius Atticus. She was also the first wife of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, close friend of the emperor Augustus.

==Early life==
Attica is generally held to have been born in 51 BC but some historians have argued for earlier dates, E. F. Leon proposed 55 BC, which was accepted by Meyer Reinhold and Stephen V. F. Waite while D. R. Shackleton Bailey dated Cicero&#x27;s letter where he mentions her recent birth to 58 BC.

Her mother, Pilia (born before 75 BC), daughter of Pilius, was a maternal granddaughter of Marcus Licinius Crassus, a member of the First Triumvirate. Her father Atticus and Pilia were married circa 58–56 BC, when Atticus was already 53 or 54 years old. Her mother died after 12 years of marriage in 46 BC.

==Name==
Attica&#x27;s father Titus Pomponius Atticus was at a relatively advanced age adopted by his maternal uncle, Quintus Caecilius, this meant according to the Roman custom that his name changed to Quintus Caecilius Pomponianus Atticus; Attica is presumed to have been born after this and thus known as &quot;Caecilia&quot;, but she has frequently been referred to as &quot;Pomponia&quot;. She was often called by the diminutive name &quot;Atticula&quot; by her father&#x27;s friend Cicero.

==Relationship to Cicero==
Attica is several times mentioned in the letters between her father and Cicero. Cicero was very fond of this little girl, whom he would never see growing into an adult as he was murdered in 43 BC. He gave her the pet name Attica, the feminine equivalent to her father&#x27;s cognomen Atticus. In his letters to Atticus Cicero often sent greetings to her, and often asked if she had one of her bouts of high fever that caused distress to him. In one letter in the beginning of the 40s BC Cicero tells him not to reprimand Attica, who was sulking and angry at Cicero. He said that she was quite right in insisting that Cicero on his last visit had not said goodbye to her properly.

==Education==
Attica was given a broad literary education. Her education started at the early age of five or six. Her father procured her a private tutor named Quintus Caecilius Epirota, one of his freedmen. Epirota was eventually accused of being inappropriate with Attica and was banished.

==Marriage and children==

Attica became Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa&#x27;s first wife. Agrippa was the right-hand man and trusted friend of Octavian (the future emperor Augustus). The two were childhood friends and had studied together in Apollonia, Illyria (modern Albania) before Julius Caesar had adopted Octavian. This made the match a very fortunate one for Attica. Cornelius Nepos states that it was Mark Antony who arranged the marriage for the couple. Nepos also notes that while Agrippa had the opportunity to marry into the nobility, he preferred to wed an equestrian.

It is uncertain when the marriage took place and the betrothal may have been decided on as early as 42 BC. Ronald Syme held that the marriage likely took place around 37 BC.

Attica&#x27;s and Agrippa&#x27;s daughter Vipsania Agrippina was born around 36 BC, she was engaged at only a year old to the future emperor Tiberius. It is possible that she and Agrippa had another daughter who was married to Quintus Haterius.

==Later life and death==

Around 28 BC Agrippa married for the second time to Octavian&#x27;s niece Claudia Marcella Major, it is unknown what became of Attica, historians have speculated that she may have died before this or that Agrippa divorced her.

Some historians have postulated that it is possible that Agrippa brought up the earlier incident of potential intimacy with her teacher Epirota from her youth as an excuse to divorce her if he wished to marry someone closer to Octavian. Gail Hamilton argued against this speculation, reasoning that Agrippa&#x27;s closeness with Attica&#x27;s father would make it unlikely that he would sacrifice his wife to slander. Luigi Cantarelli pointed out that Seutonius did not indicate that Attica was in any way to blame for Epirota&#x27;s actions, which Reinhold observes is true. Reinhold as well noted that Agrippa was greatly attached to Atticus. Agrippa continued to support and elevate members of Attica&#x27;s birth family the Pomponii in places like Butrint (where a statue of Attica may have stood) during Augustus reign.

Cantarelli has argued that it is possible that Attica was no longer alive in 32 BC because she is not mentioned by Nepos among those called to her father&#x27;s deathbed. E. Rapp believed that coins from Nemausus which depict Agrippa with a beard (a sign of public mourning in Roman culture) indicate that she died in 29 BC since the coin celebrates Agrippa&#x27;s victory over Antony and Cleopatra which was in 30 BC. Reinhold agreed that the coins could be an indication of Agrippa&#x27;s mourning after a death, but rejected Rapp&#x27;s dating of them to 29 BC.

<text>A mobile game is a video game that is typically played on a mobile phone. The term also refers to all games that are played on any portable device, including from mobile phone (feature phone or smartphone), tablet, PDA to handheld game console, portable media player or graphing calculator, with and without network availability.
The earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.

In 1997, Nokia launched &quot;Snake&quot;. &quot;Snake&quot;, which was pre-installed in most mobile devices manufactured by Nokia for a couple of years, has since become one of the most played games, at one point found on more than 350 million devices worldwide. Mobile devices became more computationally advanced allowing for downloading of games, though these were initially limited to phone carriers&#x27; own stores. Mobile gaming grew greatly with the development of app stores in 2008, such as the iOS App Store from Apple. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a mobile-platform holder, the App Store significantly changed the consumer behaviour and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as almost every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps.

Towards the end of the 20th century, mobile phone ownership became ubiquitous in the industrialised world due to the establishment of industry standards, and the rapid fall in cost of handset ownership, and use driven by economies of scale. As a result of this explosion, technological advancement by handset manufacturers became rapid. With these technological advances, mobile phone games also became increasingly sophisticated, taking advantage of exponential improvements in display, processing, storage, interfaces, network bandwidth and operating system functionality. The first such game that demonstrated the desire for handset games was a version of &quot;Snake&quot; that Nokia had included on its devices since 1997.

In 1999, NTT Docomo launched the i-mode mobile platform in Japan, allowing mobile games to be downloaded onto smartphones. Several Japanese video game developers announced games for the i-mode platform that year, such as Konami announcing its dating simulation &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;. The same year, Nintendo and Bandai were developing mobile phone adapters for their handheld game consoles, the Game Boy Color and WonderSwan, respectively. By 2001, i-mode had users in Japan, along with more advanced handsets with graphics comparable to 8-bit consoles. A wide variety of games were available for the i-mode service, along with announcements from established video game developers such as Taito, Konami, Namco, and Hudson Soft, including ports of classic arcade games and 8-bit console games.

By the mid-2000s there was a large market for mobile games, of which many were built on the Java ME platform that many devices at the time supported. Earlier they could be obtained using SMS short codes before manufacturers as well as mobile network operators started offering them for download both on the Web (on a PC to be transferred to the device) or directly via the air (using GPRS, 3G or Wi-Fi). The launch of Apple&#x27;s iPhone in 2007 and the App Store in 2008 radically changed the market. The iPhone&#x27;s focus on larger memory, multitasks, and additional sensing devices, including the touchscreen in later model, made it ideal for casual games, while the App Store, which is also independent from mobile carriers, made it easy for developers to create and post apps to publish, and for users to search for and obtain new games. Further, the App Store added the ability to support in-app purchases in October 2009. This allowed games like &quot;Angry Birds&quot; and &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; to find new monetization models away from the traditional premium &quot;pay once&quot; model. Meanwhile, Apple&#x27;s disruption caused the market to stabilized around iPhone devices and Google&#x27;s Android-based phones which offered a similar app store through Google Play.

A further major shift game with 2012&#x27;s &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; and &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, games that used a stamina-like gameplay feature found in social-network games like &quot;FarmVille&quot; to limit the number of times one could play it in a single period, but allowed optional in-app purchases to restore that stamina immediately and continue playing. This new monetization brought in millions of players to both games and millions of dollars in revenue, establishing the &quot;freemium&quot; model that would be a common approach for many mobile games going forward. Mobile gaming grew rapidly over the next several years, buoyed by rapid expansion in China. By 2016, top mobile games were earning over a year, and the total revenue for the mobile games sector had surpassed that of other video game areas.

Other major trends in mobile games have include the hyper-casual game such as &quot;Flappy Bird&quot; and &quot;Crossy Road&quot; and location-based games like &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;.

Mobile gaming has impacted the larger video game market by drawing demand away from handheld video game consoles; both Nintendo and Sony had seen major drops in sales of their 2011 handhelds compared to their 2004 predecessors as a result of mobile gaming. At the same time, mobile gaming introduced the concept of microconsoles, low-cost, low-powered home video game consoles that used mobile operating systems to take advantage of the wide variety of games available on these platforms.

===Calculator games===

Calculator gaming is a form of gaming in which games are played on programmable calculators, especially graphing calculators.

In 1980, Casio&#x27;s MG-880 pocket calculator had a built-in &quot;Invaders&quot; game (essentially a downscaled &quot;Space Invaders&quot; clone), released in the Summer that year. Another early example is the type-in program &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s Force Battle&quot; for the TI-59, published in &quot;BYTE&quot; in October 1980. The magazine also published a version of &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; for the HP-41C. Few other games exist for the earliest of programmable calculators (including the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, one of the first scientific calculators), such as the long-popular &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; game often used as an early programming exercise. However, limited program address space and lack of easy program storage made calculator gaming a rarity even as programmables became cheap and relatively easy to obtain. It was not until the early 1990s when graphing calculators became more powerful and cheap enough to be common among high school students for use in mathematics. The new graphing calculators, with their ability to transfer files to one another and from a computer for backup, could double as game consoles.

Calculators such as HP-48 and TI-82 could be programmed in proprietary programming languages such as RPL programming language or TI-BASIC directly on the calculator; programs could also be written in assembly language or (less often) C on a desktop computer and transferred to the calculator. As calculators became more powerful and memory sizes increased, games increased in complexity.

By the 1990s, programmable calculators were able to run implementations by hobbyists of games such as &quot;Lemmings&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; (Lemmings for HP-48 was released in 1993; Doom for HP-48 was created in 1995). Some games such as Dope Wars caused controversy when students played them in school.

The look and feel of these games on an HP-48 class calculator, due to the lack of dedicated audio and video circuitry providing hardware acceleration, can at most be compared to the one offered by 8-bit handheld consoles such as the early Game Boy or the Gameking (low resolution, monochrome or grayscale graphics), or to the built-in games of non-Java or BREW enabled cell phones.

Games continue to be programmed on graphing calculators with increasing complexity. A wave of games appeared after the release of the TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus series, among TI&#x27;s first graphing calculators to natively support assembly. TI-BASIC programming also rose in popularity after the release of third-party libraries. Assembly remained the language of choice for these calculators, which run on a Zilog Z80 processor, although some assembly implements have been created to ease the difficulty of learning assembly language. For those running on a Motorola 68000 processor (like the TI-89), C programming (possible using TIGCC) has begun to displace assembly.

Because they are easy to program without outside tools, calculator games have survived despite the proliferation of mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs.

==Industry structure==
Total global revenue from mobile games was estimated at $2.6 billion in 2005 by &quot;Informa Telecoms&quot; and &quot;Media&quot;. Total revenue in 2008 was $5.8 billion. The largest mobile gaming markets were in the Asia-Pacific nations Japan and China, followed by the United States. In 2012, the market had already reached $7.8 billion A new report was released in November 2015 showing that 1887 app developers would make more than one million dollars on the Google and iOS app stores in 2015.

Mobile gaming revenue reached $50.4 billion in 2017, occupying 43% of the entire global gaming market and poised for further growth. It is expected to surpass the combined revenues from both PC gaming and console gaming in 2018.

==Different platforms==
Mobile games have been developed to run on a wide variety of platforms and technologies. These include the (today largely defunct) Palm OS, Symbian, Adobe Flash Lite, NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s DoJa, Sun&#x27;s Java, Qualcomm&#x27;s BREW, WIPI, BlackBerry, Nook and early incarnations of Windows Mobile. Today, the most widely supported platforms are Apple&#x27;s iOS and Google&#x27;s Android. The mobile version of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 10 (formerly Windows Phone) is also actively supported, although in terms of market share remains marginal compared to iOS and Android.

Java was at one time the most common platform for mobile games, however its performance limits led to the adoption of various native binary formats for more sophisticated games.

Due to its ease of porting between mobile operating systems and extensive developer community, Unity is one of the most widely used engines used by modern mobile games. Apple provide a number of proprietary technologies (such as Metal) intended to allow developers to make more effective use of their hardware in iOS-native games.

==Monetization==

With the introduction of the iOS App Store and support for in-app purchases by October 2009, the methods through which mobile games earn revenue have diverged significantly away from traditional game models on consoles or computers. Since 2009, a number of models have developed, and a mobile game developer/publisher may use one or a combination of these models to make revenue.

;Premium
:The premium model is akin to the traditional model where the user pays for the full game upfront. Additional downloadable content may be available which can be purchased separately. Initial games released to the App Store before in-app purchases were available used this approach, and still common for many types of games.

;Freemium
:The freemium or &quot;free to try&quot; model offers a small portion of the game for free, comparable to a game demo. After completing this, the player is given the option to make a one-time in-app purchase to unlock the rest of the game. Early games shortly after the introduction of the in-app purchase feature used this approach such as &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; and &quot;Fruit Ninja&quot;.

;Free-to-play
:A free-to-play game requires no cost at all to play, and generally is designed to be playable from start to finish without having to spend any money into the game. However, the game will include gameplay mechanics which may slow progress towards completing the game. Commonly in mobile games, this is some form of energy or stamina that limits how many turns or actions a player can take each day. By using in-app purchases, the player can immediately restore their energy or stamina and continue on. In-app purchases can also be used to buy power-ups and other items to give the player a limited-time advantage to help complete the game. While free-to-play games had been common on computers prior to mobile, the method was popularized in mobile gaming with &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; and &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;.
;Advertising-supported
:A ad-supported game will be free to download and play, but periodically or persistently, the game will show an advertisement to the user which they will have to watch through before they can continue with the game. The developer earns revenue from the advertising network. In some cases, an in-app purchase allows the player to fully disable ads in these games.

;Subscription model
:A subscription-based game will offer a base version with limited features that can be played for free, but additional premium features can be obtained if the user pays a monthly subscription fee. If they terminate their subscription, they lose access to those features, though typically not any game progression related to those features, and can pick up those features later by restarting their subscription.

Many game apps are free to play through a combination of these models. Over time, mobile developers of these types of apps have observed that the bulk of their players do not spend any funds on their game, but instead revenues are generated from a small fraction, typically under 10% of their total players. Further, most of the revenue is generated by a very small fraction, about 2%, of the total players, who routinely spend large amounts of money on the game. A similar split on revenue had been seen in social-network games played in browsers. These players are known as &quot;whales&quot;, inspired by same term used for high rolling gamblers. The social nature of a mobile game has also been found to affect its revenue, as games that encourage players to work in teams or clans will lead to increased spending from engaged players.

==Common limits of mobile games==
Mobile games tend to be small in scope (in relation to mainstream PC and console games). Storage and memory limitations (sometimes dictated at the platform level) place constraints on file size that presently rule out the direct migration of many modern PC and console games to mobile. One major problem for developers and publishers of mobile games is describing a game in such detail that it gives the customer enough information to make a purchasing decision.

==Location-based mobile games==
Games played on a mobile device using localization technology like GPS are called location-based games or location-based mobile games. These are not only played on mobile hardware but also integrate the player&#x27;s position into the game concept. In other words, while it does not matter for a normal mobile game where exactly the player is (play them anywhere at any time), the player&#x27;s coordinate and movement are the main elements in a location-based mobile game.

A well known example is the outdoor recreational activity of geocaching, which can be played on any mobile device with integrated or external GPS receiver. External GPS receivers are usually connected via Bluetooth.

Several other location-based mobile games, such as the 2001 game &quot;BotFighters&quot;, were closer to research prototypes rather than being commercial successes.

Location-based mobile games sometimes have augmented reality functionality, such as in the case of the 2016 game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;. Usually in these cases the augmented reality functionality is not at the center of the experience.

==Augmented reality games==

Mobile devices have been used as a platform for Augmented reality (AR in short) games, using the device&#x27;s camera(s) to as an input for the game. While playing the game, the player aims the device&#x27;s camera at a location and through the device&#x27;s screen, sees the area captured by the camera plus computer-generated graphics atop it, augmenting the display and then allowing the player to interact that way. The graphics are generally drawn as to make the generated image appear to be part of the captured background, and will be rendered app memorizing as the player moves the device around. The most successful and notable example for a mobile game that has an augmented reality feature is &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; (2016), where the player travels to locations marked on their GPS map and then can enable the augmented reality mode to find Pokémon creatures to capture. However, as of January 2022 there has been a lack of significant AR mobile games success since, with several AR mobile game projects being shut down, such as Microsoft&#x27;s Minecraft Earth and Niantic&#x27;s 

== Multipurpose games ==
Since mobile devices have become present in the majority of households (at least in the developed countries), there are more and more games created with educational, lifestyle and, health improvement purposes. For example, mobile games can be used in speech-language pathology, children&#x27;s rehabilitation in hospitals (Finnish startup Rehaboo!), acquiring new useful or healthy habits (Habitica), memorizing things and learning languages (Memrise).

There are also apps with similar purposes which are not games per se, in this case, they are called &quot;gamified apps&quot;. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a line between multipurpose games and gamified apps.

==Multiplayer mobile games==

Many mobile games support multiple players, either remotely over a network or locally via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or similar technology.

There are several options for playing multiplayer games on mobile phones: live synchronous tournaments and turn-based asynchronous tournaments. In live tournaments random players from around the world are matched together to compete. This is done using different networks such as Game Center, Google Play Games, and Facebook.

In asynchronous tournaments, there are two methods used by game developers centered around the idea that players matches are recorded and then broadcast at a later time to other players in the same tournament. Asynchronous gameplay resolves the issue of needing players to have a continuous live connection. This gameplay is different since players take individual turns in the game, therefore allowing players to continue playing against human opponents.

This is done using different networks including Facebook. Some companies use a regular turn-based system where the end results are posted so all the players can see who won the tournament. Other companies take screen recordings of live players and broadcast them to other players at a later point in time to allow players to feel that they are always interacting with another human opponent.

==Distribution==
Mobile games can be distributed in one of four ways:
* Over the Air (OTA): a game binary file is delivered to the mobile device via wireless carrier networks.
* Sideloaded: a game binary file is loaded onto the phone while connected to a PC, either via USB cable or Bluetooth.
* Pre-installed: a game binary file is preloaded onto the device by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).
* Mobile browser download: a game file is downloaded directly from a mobile website.

Until the launch of Apple App Store, in the US, the majority of mobile games were sold by wireless carriers, such as AT&amp;T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile US. In Europe, games were distributed equally between carriers and off-deck, third-party stores.

After the launch of Apple App Store, the mobile OS platforms like Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows Phone, the mobile OS developers themselves have launched digital download storefronts that can be run on the devices using the OS or from software used on PCs. These storefronts (like Apple&#x27;s iOS App Store) act as centralized digital download services from which a variety of entertainment media and software can be downloaded, including games and nowadays majority of games are distributed through them.

The popularity of mobile games has increased in the 2000s, as over US$3 billion worth of games were sold in 2007 internationally, and projected annual growth of over 40%. Ownership of a smartphone alone increases the likelihood that a consumer will play mobile games. Over 90% of smartphone users play a mobile game at least once a week.

Many mobile games are distributed free to the end user, but carry paid advertising: examples are &quot;Flappy Bird&quot; and &quot;Doodle Jump&quot;. The latter follows the &quot;freemium&quot; model, in which the base game is free but additional items for the game can be purchased separately. Some of the most popular mobile game developers and publishers include Gameloft and King.

<text>Norma McCormick (born July 5, 1944 in Dauphin, Manitoba) is a Canadian politician. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1993 to 1995, and a member of the Liberal Party of Manitoba.

She was born Norma Kester, the daughter of Norman McDonald Kester and Margaret Evelyn Strang. Before entering public life, McCormick was a health-care business owner. She is the founder, and from 1987 to 1993, the president of Corporate Health Works, Inc.

==Political career==
She first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, finishing third in the central-Winnipeg riding of Wolseley. She did not run for office again until 1993, when she was elected for the nearby riding of Osborne, replacing Reg Alcock, who had resigned to run in that year&#x27;s federal election. McCormick defeated her nearest opponent, New Democrat Irene Haigh, by over 500 votes. Her time in the legislature was brief. In the 1995 provincial election, she lost to NDP candidate Diane McGifford by almost 1,000 votes. She has not sought a return to office since that time.

===Electoral record===



After her defeat, McCormick returned to the leadership of Corporate Health Works, Inc. She has also taught courses in occupational safety at the University of Manitoba.

She has served as the chair of the Standards Council of Canada&#x27;s Consumer and Public Interest Committee. In 2009, she was named chairperson of the International Organization for Standardization&#x27;s Committee on Consumer Policy for 2010–2011.

<doc id="1133796" wikidata="Q7404760" url="?curid=1133796" title="Salisbury Dock">
<text>Salisbury Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall and is connected to Nelson Dock to the north, Trafalgar Dock to the south and inland to Collingwood Dock. 

==History==
Designed by Jesse Hartley, the dock opened in 1848. Its purpose was as a half tide dock, 
connected directly to the river via two lock entrances. These provided access between the Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. 
By the mid twentieth century, the dock was the principal hub for coastal and barge traffic in Liverpool.

===Victoria Tower===
The hexagonal Victoria Tower, consisting of six clock faces, is located between the now disused lock entrances. 
The tower was based on an 1846 design by Philip Hardwick and built by Jesse Hartley in 1847-8 using irregular shaped granite blocks. The tower is inscribed with the date of its construction: &#x27;1848&#x27;. South of the former river entrance is the former Dock Master&#x27;s Office, also built by Hartley in 1848 using masonry in the Cyclopean style. The tower&#x27;s bell provided tidal and weather warnings to shipping. Although Grade II listed, the buildings are now disused and derelict. 

==Regeneration==
Salisbury Dock is part of the Stanley Dock Conservation Area 
and is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to the Pier Head. 
In 2007, the Peel Group, owners of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, unveiled the £5.5 billion &#x27;Liverpool Waters&#x27; regeneration programme. The project includes the restoration of Victoria Tower and the construction of two skyscrapers near the historic building.

<text>Winnie Yu Tsang (, born 1954) is a Hong Kong radio personality and was the deputy chairman of Commercial Radio Hong Kong from 2004 through 2015.

Yu is known for her puns in creating radio programme titles and slang phrases (e.g., si-dan-up/&quot;是但噏&quot;, literally &quot;freestyle talk&quot;, as a phonetic translation of &quot;stand-up&quot;).

Over the years, Yu has mentored many musicians and DJs, including Tat Ming Pair and Jan Lamb.

==Early life and career==
Yu grew up at Mid-Levels on Hong Kong Island, with her parents, sister and brother. She attended St. Stephen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College, a Christian all-girls school (kindergarten through high school). She wrote and produced many controversial plays in the strict environment of the religious school.

Yu left secondary school in 1971, when she was only in Fifth Form. She joined Hong Kong Commercial Radio (CR) as a DJ and first hosted a breakfast radio programme titled &quot;Morning Friends&quot; (早晨老友記). She was subsequently given the role of creative director and then programme director of the newly formed youth radio channel CR2.

In 1982, Yu left CR to form her own production company, Mes Amis Productions, and was involved in a range of media projects, including movie production.

She was invited to return to CR in 1988 as general manager, a position she held until the 2000s, when she started to gradually step out of the station&#x27;s administration. Yu resigned as CEO in 2003 and became the CEO of PCC Skyhorse, a joint venture company between Commercial Radio and Pacific Century Cyberworks.

==Recent history==
Yu returned to CR in 2004 as deputy chairman during one of the company&#x27;s most controversial periods and instituted a number of programming changes. Most notable was the cancellation of &quot;Teacup in a Storm&quot; (風波裡的茶杯), hosted by Albert Cheng, after much controversy. The host, along with Wong Yuk-man (another radio personality), were fired from the station and new programmes were initiated, including &quot;On A Clear Day&quot;.

Yu was involved in a new project created jointly by Commercial Radio and the charity St. James&#x27; Settlement and funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Skyhigh, which is described as a media training and creative production house exclusively for disadvantaged youth living in the Tin Shui Wai district of Hong Kong, offering training and job placement within the media industry.

In 2015, Yu resigned from CR after more than four decades, effective January 1, 2016.

<text>Daniel Kopec (February 28, 1954 – June 12, 2016) was an American chess International Master, author, and computer science professor at Brooklyn College.

==Education==
He graduated from Dartmouth College in the class of 1975. Kopec later received a PhD in Machine Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1982 studying under Donald Michie.

==Chess==

Kopec was Greater NY High School Champion at 14, and reached master at 17. Kopec won the Scottish Chess Championship in 1980 while pursuing his doctorate in Edinburgh. He lived in Canada for two years during the 1980s, and competed there with success, including second-equal in the 1984 Canadian Chess Championship. Kopec achieved the FIDE International Master title in 1985 and had several top three finishes (including second place ties) in the US Open.

He wrote numerous books on the subject of chess, produced eight chess instructional DVDs, and ran chess camps starting in 1994. Kopec also worked to promote his chess opening, the Kopec System (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bd3!?). With Ivan Bratko, he was the creator of the Bratko–Kopec Test, which was one of the de facto standard testing systems for chess-playing computer programs in the 1980s.

<doc id="1133814" wikidata="Q1544332" url="?curid=1133814" title="Central Australia Railway">
<text>The former Central Australia Railway, which was built between 1878 and 1929 and dismantled in 1980, was a 1067 mm narrow gauge railway between Port Augusta and Alice Springs. A standard gauge line duplicated the southern section from Port Augusta to Maree in 1957 on a new nearby alignment. The entire Central Australia Railway was superseded in 1980 after the standard gauge Tarcoola–Alice Springs Railway was opened, using a new route up to 200 km to the west. A small southern section of the original line between Port Augusta and Quorn has been preserved and is operated as the Pichi Richi Railway.

==Naming==
The line became known as the &quot;Central Australia Railway&quot; when the Commonwealth Railways took it over from the South Australian Railways in 1929. Before then, it was known by several names, in part because the northern end point had not be determined, funding being intermittent. Government acts and the press used a number of terms prior to construction including:
* Port Augusta Railway
* Northern Railway
* Great Northern Railway
* Port Augusta to (far) North Railway.
After construction, railway was referred to as:
* &quot;Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway&quot;
* &quot;North–South Railway&quot; in possible anticipation to extend the line to Darwin.

It has also often been referred to as the &quot;Great Northern Railway&quot; in the 1890s and into the twentieth century. The most southern part of the line between Port Augusta and Quorn is now referred to as the Pichi Richi Tourist Railway.

Another colloquial name used was &quot;The Ghan&quot;, after the passenger train that utilised the line. It is suggested that &quot;The &#x27;Ghan&quot; name is in recognition of the Afghan Cameleers that plied their trade in the area well before the railway; however, see The Ghan (Etymology) for alternatives. This colloquial term for the railway appears to have been widely in use from at least the early 1930s; it may have been in use prior to this. The new Adelaide–Darwin railway line initially used &quot;The New Ghan&quot; as a trading name. It has now reverted to &quot;The Ghan&quot;, relegating the original line name colloquially as &quot;The Old Ghan&quot;.

==History==

=== Initial proposal ===
From the proposal for a line heading north of Port Augusta to turning the first sod in 1878 took 18 years and the process was referred to by the press as one &quot;which has so far failed to extend itself out of the region of nebulous ideas.&quot;.

The key issues reported at the time were as follows.

==== Cost benefits ====
Significant debate about the cost delayed and eventually altered the final design. The costs were significant for the South Australian colony and there was rigorous debate over that period. Mineral extraction was touted as the key benefit, with farming and passenger traffic deemed by many as being uneconomic alone although others suggest the key products were &#x27;wool, station stores, and copper&#x27; in that order. The cost per kilometre was set in the Acts which precluded more expensive options.

==== Gauge and minimum speed ====
There was fierce debate about the gauge of the line, the maximum weight to be carried and maximum speed as all three dictated the cost.

==== Route and end point ====
A multitude of routes and end-points were nominated with over a dozen potential routes explored, most of these to the north. End points that were discussed included Government Gums (Farina, South Australia (320 km), Yudnamutana, South Australia (390 km) and Beltana (232 km). The 1867 Act stated that the line would be 200 miles from Port Augusta. Newspapers of the time did mention extending the line to Port Darwin although this was not gazetted in Parliament.

==== Funding: public or private sector ====
The South Australian Railways, as the agent of the colonial government, wanted to build the line, and there were others who thought that investors, predominantly from the United Kingdom, would offer better value for money. The South Australian Railways developed a trial called the Northern Extension Railway to Burra to test the engineering capabilities.

==Legislation==
The following Acts were passed by the parliament of South Australia and, after federation in 1901, the Australian parliament.


== Construction ==
Design, construction, as well as a hiatus, occurred in four periods distinct under both South Australian and Federal Australian Governments over a fifty-year period.

=== Initial design and route ===
Around 1871, there was general agreement between Robert C. Patterson, Assistant Engineer (report writer), H. C. Mais, (Engineer-in-Chief) and Surveyor General. George Goyder (creator of the Goyder line of rainfall) about the length and route of the railway. All three could not see going further north than Beltana (232 km) due to rain fall and environment, The two options out of Port Augusta were the Western Plains and the Pichi Richi routes. The Pichi Richi route, while more expensive, offered access to the farmland to the west.

An extensive permanent survey was conducted circa 1876 and the final route mapped to Government Gums due to the water available at the terminus. The length was to be &quot;198 miles 66.92 chains&quot;, and the route consisted of &quot;no less than 64 bridges, ranging in length from 20 feet to 740 feet, 470 flood-openings from 10 to 40 feet wide, 550 culverts from 2 feet 6 inches to 10 feet wide, 61 pipe-drains,and 14 water courses&quot;.

=== Initial build to Farina (Government Gums) ===
The first sod was turned at Port Augusta on 18 January 1878 and took until 1882 to reach Government Gums (320 km), 1884 Maree (372 km), 1888 Coward Springs (501 km) and finally Oodnadatta in 1891 (770 km). Construction was by South Australian Railways as a narrow gauge railway.

=== Cessation of work ===
Between 1891 and 1926, the railway line was not extended. Discussion occurred about whether the existing line should be extended or a standard-gauge railway from Tarcoola should be initiated. The South Australian Railways were transferred to the Australian federal government on 1 January 1911, but because the federal government at that stage did not possess a railway department, the South Australian Railways continued running the service until 1 January 1926. In 1926, Commonwealth Railways took over the running and commenced planning for extending the railway line north.

=== Completion from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs ===

Extending the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs commenced around 1926 and was completed on 6 August 1929.

The Northern Territory Act (Cth 1910) required the building of a north–south railway although no date was specified. Two unballasted routes were shortlisted with a standard gauge line from Kingoonya to Alice Springs estimated at 4.5m pounds and the 1.7m pound narrow gauge extension from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The 270 miles 65 chain extension was passed after a number of debates in Federal Parliament.

Railway workers were paid 5 pounds, 8 shillings a week and a request for this to be raised to 6 pounds per week was refused by Sir John Quick in the Federal Arbitration Court on 11 March 1927.

The first train consisted of 12 carriages including Mail and Fruit vans. There were 60 first class and 60 second class passengers and left on 5 August 1929 however an official ceremony to be attended by the Prime Minister was cancelled due to the cost of running a special train.

== Operations ==

===Conditions===
The tortuously curving narrow-gauge line between Marree and Alice Springs was notoriously prone to delays, often caused by flash floods washing away bridges and tracks. Some track was laid on sand without ballast, and wood sleepers were used, serving as food for termites, causing unstable tracks.

===Floods===
The choice of route through the most arid regions of Australia was influenced above all by the need for water for steam locomotives. Since time immemorial, Aboriginal people had followed a chain of artesian springs and waterholes to sustain them when carrying ochre from the Far North of South Australia to trading places in the south. The explorer John McDouall Stuart followed a similar route during several expeditions between 1858 and 1862. The route taken by the Overland Telegraph ten years later, to which Stuart is believed to have given attention during his travels, was very similar. When the railway route was surveyed, it was hardly surprising that it followed the reliable sources of water. The downside – an endless source of frustration for the railway maintainers – was that washouts occurred at some locations almost every year. When heavy rains fell inland in New South Wales and Queensland, gigantic &quot;flash floods&quot; came down normally dry riverbeds; bridges, embankments and other earthworks gave way under the onslaught. All but the largest bridge were severely damaged or washed away entirely, and miles of track were washed out – almost every year at some locations. 

=== World War II ===
In 1944, it was reported that trains had increased on the line from the normal two a week to 56, whilst the North Australia Railway had increased from one a week to 147. Rolling stock, sidings, marshaling areas and water points for the steam engines were all key issues in increasing traffic on the line.

=== Diesel locomotives ===
The first diesel-electric locomotive entered service in June 1954. It was one of 14 locomotives ordered for both the Central and North Australia Railway. Built by the Birmingham Carriage and Wagon company, the locomotives had a maximum range of about and were designed to haul at on level track.

==Film==
Shortly before the closure of the narrow gauge line in 1980, BBC Television filmed an episode of the television series &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot; featuring the original route of the Ghan (and the infamously slow speed of the train).

== Decline, conversion to standard gauge and closure ==
After World War II, the railway line existence became questionable for a number of reasons:

* The railway had a history of extensive flood damage as the original steam engines required access to streams which were prone to floods.
* The track was narrow gauge and not ballasted and thus loads and speeds were both reduced, reducing the profitability of the line.
* Goyder&#x27;s Line of rainfall (1865), excluding rains in 1865, 1872 and some other years, was shown as being highly accurate with communities and cropping lands north of his line being abandoned after long dry spells. The entire railway is north of this line.
* Trucks and roads were becoming more reliable and utilised in South Australia.
* The 1910 Northern Territory Acceptance Act mandating a railway line between Darwin and Adelaide requiring a standard gauge railway, which would need to be less susceptible to flooding than the existing route designed for diesel-electric engines rather than steam.
* Improved railway engineering and construction methods allowed for improved design.
* The standard gauge upgrade of the southern section of the line from near Port Augusta to Maree placed pressure on the remaining narrow gauge sections that remained opened due to transfer and maintenance costs.

===Standard gauge line to Marree===
In 1949, both South Australia and the Federal Government enacted the Railway Standardisation (South Australia) Agreement Act which looked at the upgrade of all lines to standard gauge, including the Central Australia Line. The act was more of an overarching statement rather than a commitment to complete all lines in a set order or time.

The Leigh Creek and Telford Cut Coalfields were first excavated in 1943 following a shortage of coal during World War II and between 1951 and 1954, discussions surrounded two route options to upgrade to standard gauge. Option B2 was upgrading the current line to Telford, the C option was the chosen option which was up to 32 km west of the current line. The South Australian and Federal governments bickered over by-passing the township of Quorn and it was only after a Royal Commission, that the Commonwealth Railways got their way with option C avoiding Quorn and the work commenced on the 255 km line.

The South Australian Government and agriculturists wanted to extend the standard gauge line a further 88 km to Marree. This would reduce the bruising of the cattle and shorten the time to market as well as increase the number of cattle that could be transferred. Transferring livestock at Telford was considered problematic with coal dust and machinery.

The federal minister of transport travelled to the area in mid-1954 and confirmed the extension from Telford Cut to Marree. The cost was set at 1,241,000 pounds, compared to 821,000 pounds to bring the existing line up to an acceptable level including ballasting and possible bridge replacement.

The Minister for Transport, Senator George McLeay and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, Mr. P. J. Hannaberry, both stated that they were &quot;strongly in favour&quot; to extend the standard gauge line all the way to Alice Springs in 1952. By April 1954, Hannaberry had changed his mind and stated it was &quot;out of the question&quot;.

In 1957, the Marree Railway Line, the new standard gauge line from Stirling North (near Port Augusta) to Marree (372 km from Port Augusta) opened, replacing the existing line via Quorn. This was predominantly for coal to be transferred from the Leigh Creek and Telford Cut Coalfields to the power stations at Stirling North. The line was extended to Marree for cattle to be transported to market from the grazing plains, including around the Birdsville Track.

=== Closures ===
With the new standard gauge Marree Railway Line opened, the narrow gauge line began to close in sections:

*1957: The section between Brachina (173 km) to Beltana (232 km) is closed in March
*1957: The section between Leigh Creek (262 km) to Marree (372 km) is closed in July
*1958: Beltana (232 km) to Leigh Creek (262 km) closed in July.
*1972: Port Augusta (0 km) to Hawker (105 km) closed.
**Some sections of the narrow-gauge line remain in operation as the Pichi Richi Railway and the section from Port Augusta to Stirling North was realigned and restored in 2000–2002.
*1981: The entire narrow gauge line was closed with the section between Marree (372 km) and Alice Springs (1243 km) abandoned, replaced by Tarcoola-Alice Springs line standard gauge line.
*1987: Standard gauge between Marree and Telford Cut closed.
*2016: Stirling North-Telford Cut standard gauge line mothballed after power station and mine closure. On 3 December 2016, Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia began storing wagons in the disused sidings at Stirling North. various rail operators including Bowmans Rail, Sydney Rail Services, One Rail Australia, Southern Shorthaul Railroad and Pacific National have operated trains to and from the sidings for desire or temporary storage of trains and wagons. 

*2018: For a short period between 28 February 2018 &amp; 29 July 2018, Bowmans Rail were operating a section of the former Leigh Creek Line for a few kms to off-load containers used in the construction of the Bungala Solar Farm. 

*2023: Trains now run as required to CFCLA’s (now RailFirst Asset Management) Stirling North Yard including twice in 2023.

== Heritage trail, restoration and preserved sections ==
The old railway route is now a heritage trail.

In 1974, the newly formed Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society commenced a restoration program, headquartered at Quorn at the picturesque southern end of the railway; Stirling North, near Port Augusta, was the other terminus. It progressively restored and operated the Pichi Richi Railway as a working museum, upgrading track and undertaking preservation of a wide range of South Australian Railways rolling stock and some locomotives, secured against deterioration in the former running sheds. Between 2000 and 2002, the line was extended 12 km (7 mi) to Port Augusta station, running alongside the standard gauge mainline for about half the distance.

In May 2016, traffic ceased on the standard gauge line between Telford Cut coal mine and Port Augusta after the power station at Port Paterson was shut down.

The Farina Restoration Project Group, whose members travel to the former town at agreed periods to work voluntarily, is restoring the small, now-deserted railway township of Farina.

<text>Around the World in 80 Days (sometimes spelled as Around the World in Eighty Days) is a 1956 American epic adventure-comedy film starring David Niven, Cantinflas, Robert Newton and Shirley MacLaine, produced by the Michael Todd Company and released by United Artists.

The picture was directed by Michael Anderson and produced by Mike Todd, with Kevin McClory and William Cameron Menzies as associate producers. The screenplay, based on the classic 1873 novel of the same name by Jules Verne, was written by James Poe, John Farrow, and S.J. Perelman. The music score was composed by Victor Young, and the Todd-AO 70 mm cinematography (processed by Technicolor) was by Lionel Lindon. The film&#x27;s six-minute-long animated title sequence, shown at the end of the film, was created by award-winning designer Saul Bass.

The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

==Plot==
Broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow presents an onscreen prologue, featuring footage from &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (1902) by Georges Méliès, explaining that it is based loosely on the book &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; by Jules Verne. Also included is the launching of an unmanned rocket and footage of the earth receding.

In 1872, an English gentleman Phileas Fogg claims he can circumnavigate the world in eighty days. Met with scepticism, he makes a £20,000 wager (worth about £ today) with four fellow members of the Reform Club (each contributing £5,000 to the bet) that he can make the journey and arrive back at the club eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening.

Together with his resourceful French valet, Passepartout, Fogg goes hopscotching around the globe generously spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can accommodate tight steamship schedules. Having reached Paris they hear that a tunnel under the Alps is blocked. The Thomas Cook agent who assists them offers to hire or sell them his hot air balloon. Fogg buys it and they fly over the Alps drinking champagne.

Blown off-course, the two accidentally end up in Spain, where we see a table-top flamenco sequence performed in a bar. Later, Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight. Next, they go to Brindisi in Italy. Meanwhile, back in London, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen £55,000 (around £ today) from the Bank of England so Police Inspector Fix is sent out by Scotland Yard to trail him (starting in Suez) but must keep waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in the British controlled ports they visit.

In India, Fogg and Passepartout rescue beautiful young widow Aouda from being forced into a funeral pyre with her late husband. The three then travel to Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and the Wild West (including the Sioux Nation). Reaching New York, they arrange their passage on a cargo steamship travelling to Venezuela – Fogg bribes the captain to go to England. Alas, they run out of coal mid-ocean and the ship stops. Fogg buys the ship and then instructs the crew to take everything that burns, including lifeboats, to provide fuel.

They arrive in Liverpool, where, still with just enough time left to travel to London and win his wager, Fogg is promptly arrested by the diligent yet misguided Inspector Fix.

Detaining Fogg at the police station, the embarrassed Fix discovers that the real culprit has already been apprehended by police in Brighton. Although Fogg is exculpated and free to go, he now has insufficient time to reach London before his deadline, and so has lost everything but the enduring love of the winsome Aouda. Upon returning to London, Fogg asks Passepartout to arrange a church wedding for the next day, Monday. Salvation comes when Passepartout is shocked to be informed that the next day is actually Sunday. Fogg then realizes that by traveling east towards the rising sun and crossing the International Date Line, he has gained a day. Thus, there is still just enough time to reach the Reform Club and win the bet. Fogg rushes to the club, arriving just before the 8:45 pm chime. Passepartout and Aouda then arrive behind him, inadvertently shocking everyone, as no woman has ever entered the Reform Club before.

==Cast==
The film boasts an all-star cast, with David Niven and Cantinflas in the lead roles of Fogg and Passepartout. Fogg is the classic Victorian upper-class English gentleman, well-dressed, well-spoken, and extremely punctual, whereas his servant Passepartout (who has an eye for the ladies) provides much of the comic relief as a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; for the film in contrast to his master&#x27;s strict formality. Joining them are Shirley MacLaine as the beautiful Indian Princess Aouda and Robert Newton as the determined but hapless Detective Fix, in his last role. Suzanne Alexander and Marla English were initially the finalists for the role of Princess Aouda, but it was given to MacLaine, who accepted the role after having turned it down twice. Others who tested for the role were Sylvia Lewis, Lisa Davis, Audrey Conti, Eleanore Tanin, Eugenia Paul, Joan Elan, and Jaqueline Park.

The role of Passepartout was greatly expanded from the novel to accommodate Cantinflas, the most famous Latin-American comedian at the time, and he winds up stealing the film. While Passepartout describes himself as a Parisian in the novel, this is unclear in the filmhe has a French name, but speaks fluent Spanish when he and his master arrive in Spain by balloon. In the Spanish version, the name of his character was changed from the French Passepartout to the Spanish Juan Picaporte, the name the character has in the early Spanish translations of the novel. There is also a comic bullfighting sequence which was especially created for Cantinflas and is not in the novel. Indeed, when the film was released in some Spanish-speaking nations, Cantinflas was billed as the lead. According to the guidebook, this was done because of an obstacle Todd faced in casting Cantinflas, who had never previously appeared in an American movie and had turned down numerous offers to do so. Todd allowed him to appear in the film as a Latin, &quot;so,&quot; the actor said himself, &quot;...to my audience in Latin America, I&#x27;ll still be Cantinflas.&quot;

More than 40 famous performers make brief cameo appearances, including John Gielgud, Charles Boyer, Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, Cedric Hardwicke, Peter Lorre, Charles Coburn, Noël Coward, Buster Keaton, George Raft, Cesar Romero, Red Skelton and Frank Sinatra. The film was significant as the first of the so-called Hollywood &quot;make work&quot; films, employing dozens of film personalities. John Wayne turned down Todd&#x27;s offer for the role of the Colonel leading the Cavalry charge, a role filled by Colonel Tim McCoy. James Cagney, Gary Cooper, and Kirk Douglas—along with Wayne—were considered for the role, but according to Michael Todd, &quot;they all wanted to kid it.&quot; Promotional material released at the time quoted a Screen Actors Guild representative looking at the shooting call sheet and crying: &quot;Good heavens Todd, you&#x27;ve made extras out of all the stars in Hollywood!&quot; As of 2025, Shirley MacLaine is the last surviving billed cast member, as well as the uncredited Marion Ross.

==Production==
&quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; was produced by Broadway showman Michael Todd, based on a musical by Orson Welles and Jules Verne&#x27;s adventure novel. Todd had never before produced a film. The director he hired, Michael Anderson, had directed the highly acclaimed British World War II feature &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; feature (1956), and other classic films. Todd sold his interest in the Todd-AO format to help finance the film.

Because Todd-AO ran at 30 frames per second, which was incompatible with the 35mm standard of 24 fps, &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; was filmed twice, like the first feature in Todd-AO, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Unlike &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, however, which was filmed additionally in 35mm CinemaScope, &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; was filmed simultaneously in Todd-AO at 24 frames per second so that from this negative, 35mm reduction prints could be produced for general release. After these two films, the specification for Todd-AO was altered after the third film in the format, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, to 24 fps running, making it unnecessary to film subsequent productions twice.

In his 1971 autobiographical book &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, actor David Niven discussed his meeting with Todd and the subsequent events that led to the film being produced. According to Niven, when Todd asked him if he would appear as Fogg, Niven enthusiastically replied, &#x27;I&#x27;d do it for nothing!&#x27; He later admitted to being grateful that Todd did not hold him to his claim. He also described the first meeting between Todd and Robert Newton (who had drinking problems) when the latter was offered the role of the detective, Fix; Niven alleged that Newton was offered the part on condition that he did not drink any alcohol during the filming, and that his celebration following the completion of his role led to his untimely demise (he did not live to see the film released).

Filming took place in late 1955, from August 9 to December 20. The crew worked fast (75 actual days of filming), producing of film, which was edited down to of finished film. The picture cost just under $6 million to make, employing 112 locations in 13 countries and 140 sets. Todd said he and the crew visited every country portrayed in the picture, including England, France, India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), Spain, Thailand, and Japan. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s review of the film, the cast, including extras, totaled 68,894 people; it also featured 7,959 animals, &quot;including four ostriches, six skunks, 15 elephants, 17 fighting bulls, 512 rhesus monkeys, 800 horses, 950 burros, 2,448 American buffalo, 3,800 Rocky Mountain sheep and a sacred cow that eats flowers on cue&quot;. There is also a cat at the Reform Club. The wardrobe department spent $410,000 to provide 74,685 costumes and 36,092 trinkets. This is allegedly the most costumes ever required for a Hollywood production.

Some 10,000 extras were used in filming the bullfight scene in Spain, with Cantinflas as the matador; Cantinflas had previously done some bullfighting. They used all 6,500 residents of a small Spanish town called Chinchón, from Madrid, but Todd decided there were not enough spectators, so he found 3,500 more from nearby towns. He used 650 Indians for a fight on a train in the West. Many were indeed Indians, but some were Hollywood extras. All 650 had their skin color altered with dye. Todd used about of orange-coloured dye for those extras.

Todd sometimes used models of boats, ships, and trains in the film, but he often decided that they did not look realistic so he switched to the real thing where he could. The scene of a collapsing train bridge is partly without models. The overhead shot of a train crossing a bridge was full scale, but the bridge collapse was a large-scale miniature, verifiable by observing the slightly jerky motion of the rear passenger car as the train pulls away, as well as the slowed-down water droplets which are out of scale in the splashing river below. All the steamships shown in the first half are miniatures shot in an outdoor studio tank. The exception is the American ship shown at the intermission point, which is real. The &quot;American&quot; ship is the Japanese training barque &quot;Kaiwo Maru&quot;. A tunnel was built for a train sequence out of paper mache. After the train filming was complete, the &quot;tunnel&quot; was pushed over into the gorge. Many of the special effects are described and pictured in a 1956 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; article.

The scenes of the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by steamship took place off San Francisco and were shot on a specially built prop steamer, a converted barge mocked up to resemble a small ocean-going steamship, with mock paddles driven by the electric motor from an old streetcar. In his memoirs, Niven described the whole thing as being dangerously unstable (though stability improved as it was dismantled as though to feed it into its own furnaces as the plot required).

One of the most famous sequences in the film, the flight by hydrogen balloon, is not in the original Jules Verne novel. Because the film was made in Todd-AO, the sequence was expressly created to show off the locations seen on the flight, as projected on the giant curved screen used for the process. A similar balloon flight can be found in an earlier Jules Verne novel, &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;, in which the protagonists explore Africa from a hydrogen balloon.

Many of the balloon scenes with Niven and Cantinflas were filmed using a crane. Even that height bothered Niven, who was afraid of heights. Tom Burges, who was shorter than Niven, was used as a stand-in for scenes where the balloon is seen from a distance. Many of the lots used in the film are now on the land occupied by Century City, an office complex in the Los Angeles area.

In his memoirs, Niven related that Todd completed filming while in considerable debt. The post-production work on the film was an exercise in holding off Todd&#x27;s creditors long enough to produce a saleable film, and the footage was worked upon under the supervision of Todd&#x27;s creditors and returned to a secure vault each night, as if it were in escrow.

The film&#x27;s release and subsequent success vindicated Todd&#x27;s considerable efforts.

==Release==
The film premiered on October 17, 1956, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City and played to full houses for 15 months. It ran for 102 weeks at the theatre, with 1,564 performances, 2,173,238 patrons and a gross of $4,872,326.

It topped &quot;Variety&quot; monthly box office chart for seven months during 1957. By the time of Todd&#x27;s death in a private plane crash, 18 months after the film had opened, it had grossed $33 million.

By November 1958, the film had earned worldwide rentals of $22 million including $4.6 million from overseas from just 280 engagements. None of the overseas engagements at that date had been in Todd-AO.

In Spanish and Latin American posters and programs of the movie, Cantinflas is billed above the other players because he was very popular in Spanish-speaking countries. There were two souvenir programmes sold in theatres. For Roadshow screenings Todd-AO is mentioned, though for general release those pages are not contained in the book. The programme was created by Todd&#x27;s publicist, Art Cohn, who died in the plane crash with him. His biography, &quot;The Nine Lives of Michael Todd&quot;, was published after their deaths which put a macabre spin on the title.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Bosley Crowther called the film a &quot;sprawling conglomeration of refined English comedy, giant-screen travel panoramics and slam-bang Keystone burlesque&quot; and wrote that Todd and the film&#x27;s crew &quot;commandeered the giant screen and stereophonic sound as though they were Olsen and Johnson turned loose in a cosmic cutting-room, with a pipe organ in one corner and all the movies ever made to toss around&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called it &quot;brassy, extravagant, long-winded and funny&quot; and the &quot;Polyphemus of productions&quot;, writing &quot;as a travelogue, &quot;Around the World&quot; is at least as spectacular as anything Cinerama has slapped together&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; highlighted the performance of &quot;the famous Mexican comic, Cantinflas [who in] his first U.S. movie ... gives delightful evidence that he may well be, as Charles Chaplin once said he was, ‘the world&#x27;s greatest clown’.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 43 reviews and gave the film an aggregate score of 72%, with an average rating of 6/10, with the site&#x27;s consensus stating: &quot;It&#x27;s undeniably shallow, but its cheerful lack of pretense -- as well as its grand scale and star-stuffed cast -- help make &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; charmingly light-hearted entertainment.&quot;
The development of the film and the personal life of actor Mario Moreno during that time were dramatized later in the 2014 film &quot;Cantinflas&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning five (including Best Picture), beating out critically and publicly praised films: &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot;, &quot;Giant&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. It is also one of the few Best Picture winners not to be nominated in any acting category.

Although not nominated for Best Original Song, the film&#x27;s theme song &quot;Around the World&quot; (music by Victor Young; lyrics by Harold Adamson), became very popular. It was a hit for Bing Crosby in 1957, and was a staple of the easy-listening genre for many years: &quot;Around the world, I searched for you / I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous ... No more will I go all around the world / For I have found my world in you.&quot;

The film was screened at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

===Anniversary celebration===

On the first anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, Todd threw a party at the Madison Square Garden attended by
18,000 people; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the party a &quot;spectacular flop&quot; though Todd shrugged off the remark, saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t say it was a little bust.&quot; The event, featured on a 90-minute CBS telecast, could boast of &quot;a colossal hodgepodge of bagpipers, folk dancers, Philadelphia Mummers, Russian wolfhounds, oxen, Siamese cats, elephants, clowns, a fire engine, and a symphony orchestra.&quot;

==Distribution and ownership==

The film was originally distributed by United Artists in two Todd-AO 70 mm versions, one for Todd-AO 70 mm release at 30 frames per second, and an alternative 70 mm version at 24 frames per second reduced to 35 mm for general release.

The original Todd-AO 70mm running time without the extra music was 179 minutes. However, after the Chicago showing Todd cut four minutes out of the Western sequence where Cantinflas is pursued by Indians. The 70mm print shown at The Rivoli theatre in NYC was 175 minutes. However, the original 35mm Technicolor/anamorphic magnetic stereo and mono optical prints ran the complete 179 minutes with the chase scene intact. Although the leaders on the optical sound prints were labelled for Perspecta directional encoding, the prints do not contain the signal and were standard mono.

In 1968, additional cuts were made including removing most of the prologue with the changing aspect ratios. Only a brief few shots with Edward R. Murrow remained and the entire &quot;Trip to the Moon&quot; clips were cut. Since the opening shot of Murrow was 1.33 window boxed in the wide frame, they had to crop and blow up that shot for the 2.35 ratio which made it very grainy. The intermission was also cut for the 1968 re-release which included the freeze frame of the ship and fade into the second half. The reels just
jump cut with an awkward sound gap between the first and second half. The chase scene was missing from this version too which reduced the running time to 167 minutes. However, some uncut 179-minute 35mm Technicolor prints were struck too which meant at least some theatres played the Roadshow version even though the vast majority showed the shorter cut. 35mm IB/Scope copies of both versions exist from 1968. The 24 frames per second 70mm prints were also the 167-minute version in that year too. As a publicity stunt, Todd Jr. called the press when he removed a 70mm copy from a bank vault claiming it had been stored there since 1956 for safe keeping and was being shown at a theatre again. The copy they exhibited was the cut re-issue 167-minute version.

Around 1976, after its last network television broadcast on CBS, United Artists lost control of the film to Elizabeth Taylor, who was the widow of producer Michael Todd and had inherited a portion of Todd&#x27;s estate. In 1983, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the film from Taylor, and reissued the film theatrically in a re-edited 143-minute version (this version would subsequently air only once on Turner Classic Movies, this was before any restoration on the movie was announced). In the years that followed, a pan-and-scan transfer of the alternative 24 frame/s version (presented at its full 183-minute length) was shown on cable television.

In 2004, Warner Bros. issued a digitally restored version of the 24 frame/s incarnation on DVD, also at its full 183-minute length, but also including the original intermission, Entr&#x27;acte, and exit music segments that were a part of the original 1956 theatrical release, and for the first time on home video at its original 2.2:1 aspect widescreen ratio.

This restored version was reconstructed from the best available elements of the 24 frame/s edition Warner Bros. could find, and was subsequently shown on Turner Classic Movies. The original elements from the 30 frame/s/70 mm Todd-AO version (as well as the original prints derived from these elements) still exist, albeit in faded condition due to the passage of time, but remain to be formally restored by Warner Bros. There is some missing footage in the India train ride where the image artificially fades in and out to compensate for the missing shots.

Warner Bros. retained Andy Pratt Film Labs who in conjunction with Eastman Kodak developed a method to remove the cracked and faded-to-brown, clear lacquer from the original 65 mm Technicolor negative. Warners did nothing further to restore the negative. Due to costs of making a 70 mm release print even without magnetic striping, using DTS disk for audio, there are no immediate plans for any new prints. The 65 mm roadshow print negative was used for the DVD release. Had any 35 mm Anamorphic elements been used the aspect ratio would have been 2.35:1. Mike Todd had limited 35 mm anamorphic prints made with a non-standard compression ratio to provide a 2.21:1 viewing experience. These special 35 mm prints are called Cinestage, the same name of Mike Todd&#x27;s showcase theatre in Chicago.

Best available prints of the 30 frame/s/70 mm version have recently been exhibited in revival movie houses worldwide. As of the present time, Warner Bros. remains the film&#x27;s rights holder.

==Soundtrack and home media==
The DVDs for &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; include four hours of supplemental material, in addition to the restored three-hour wide-screen presentation. Included on one of the disks is a documentary film, about 50 minutes long, about Michael Todd.

The soundtrack was commercially released on vinyl and audio tape. Two CD versions were released as well, including a digital remastering of the original Decca album on MCA in the 1980s and an expanded version with extra tracks on the Hit Parade Records label in Canada in 2007. There was also a model kit of the balloon, a board game, and a Dell Comics adaptation. A Cantinflas puppet was released separately, dressed in an outfit similar to the Passepartout costume.

==Theme parks==
Alton Towers theme park in England had a dark boat ride based on the film operating between 1981-1993.

<text>&quot;For the current city, see Saginaw, Michigan&quot;

The City of Saginaw (Saginaw City) is a defunct city in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan that has been consolidated into a new municipality bearing the same name. To distinguish between the currently existing &quot;City of Saginaw&quot; and the former City of Saginaw, the name &quot;Saginaw City&quot; is used for the defunct city even though it was never incorporated under that name or called such during its time.

The first permanent white settlement in the area was a fur-trading post on the west side of the Saginaw River established in 1816 by Louis Campau. The U.S. federal government extinguished Native American interests for most of the land in the area with the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819, clearing the way for white settlers. In 1822 the post became Fort Saginaw. Campau platted the town in 1823.

Saginaw City was incorporated as a city in 1857. On June 2, 1889, the Michigan State Legislature passed an act to consolidate the cities of Saginaw City and East Saginaw to form the present-day city of Saginaw, which became effective with the election of officers for the consolidated city in March 1890.

<text>A psammoma body is a round collection of calcium, seen microscopically. The term is derived .

==Cause==
Psammoma bodies are associated with the (nipple-like) histomorphology and are thought to arise from,
# Infarction and calcification of papillae tips.
# Calcification of intralymphatic tumor thrombi.

==Association with lesions==
Psammoma bodies are commonly seen in certain tumors such as:
* Papillary thyroid carcinoma
* Papillary renal cell carcinoma
* Ovarian papillary serous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma
* Endometrial adenocarcinomas (papillary serous carcinoma ~3%-4%)
* Meningiomas, in the central nervous system
* Peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma
* Somatostatinoma (pancreas)
* Prolactinoma of the pituitary 
*Glucagonoma
* Micropapillary subtype of lung adenocarcinoma

==Benign lesions==

Psammoma bodies may be seen in:
* Endosalpingiosis
* Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma
* Melanocytic nevus

==Appearance==
Psammoma bodies usually have a laminar appearance, are circular, acellular and basophilic.

<text>George Douglas Gimarc ( ; born 1957) is an American disc jockey, record and radio program producer and author based in Texas and is in the Texas Radio Hall of Fame. He is known for his knowledge about the classic rock radio format, recorded music in general, and specifically the era of punk rock. His broadcast programs have been heard in various formats in the U.S., Canada, Europe and New Zealand, via licensed stations and unlicensed pirate radio transmitters.

==Early life==
After attending Wallace Elementary School in Dallas, George Gimarc graduated from Lake Highlands High School in the class of 1975.

===DJ career===
Gimarc began his career as an intern at WRR AM in Dallas in April 1975, then worked at college as a disc jockey on the University of North Texas radio station KNTU. In the spring of 1977, he started a new weekly show called Punk &amp; New Wave, which eventually became known as The Rock &amp; Roll Alternative when it moved to KZEW-FM in Dallas, making its debut on May 18, 1980. This was one of the first regular new wave or punk radio shows in the United States.

&quot;The Rock &amp; Roll Alternative&quot; program was responsible for introducing acts such as R.E.M., The Go-Go&#x27;s, U2, The Psychedelic Furs, The Sex Pistols, Devo, The B-52&#x27;s, XTC, The Smiths, The Cult, and hundreds of others to the listening audience of the Dallas and Fort Worth metroplex listening area from 1977 onwards. It went through three different theme songs, but its most familiar was the one provided by new friends The Bangles when they were recording their first album.

&quot;The Rock &amp; Roll Alternative&quot; program moved to commercial radio on May 18, 1980, and continued for 14 years until it was retired. Along the way, it was heard on four different licensed stations throughout its run in Texas - KNTU / KZEW / KNON / KDGE. After the show moved to KZEW (&quot;The Zoo&quot;) in Dallas, George Gimarc in association with John England began to promote the ideology of free radio (as opposed to government censored radio) within the show. Gimarc announced the show as being heard on the &quot;flagship station&quot; KZEW and the Four Freedoms World Service (4FWS) which relayed the program via recordings for retransmission by a network of unlicensed pirate radio stations that transmitted on AM, FM and shortwave in Europe, and shortwave from New Zealand via KIWI Radio, to Australasia. A Texas network of Public-access television cable TV channels called 4FTN, also aired special editions of Gimarc&#x27;s programs.

While Gimarc was hosting &quot;The Rock &amp; Roll Alternative&quot; on KZEW-FM, in 1983 he also became music director on its sister AM station KRQX (&quot;K-Rocks&quot;) and turned it into a new format designed to be the flipside to the AOR sister station KZEW. While the Zoo was playing Kansas, The Eagles and Eddie Money, this new station played the older items they could no longer fit into the playlist - the Beatles, CCR, and Hendrix.

In 1987, after both KZEW and KRQX changed ownership (from Belo to Anchor) and formats, he began a new program called &quot;Back Pages&quot; on KZPS in Dallas. This was an eclectic classic rock show combining rare records, intriguing stories and listener requests.

In June 1989, Gimarc was the first official hire of the new station KDGE (&quot;The Edge&quot;) where he developed the new commercial alternative format along with Wendy Naylor. He was on air daily in the afternoons and served as Music Director as well as doing the R&amp;R Alternative for another year or so. He, and several other key members of the staff were shown the door in 1993 when the station decided to take a more mainstream (chart) approach to music, and was no longer as keen on breaking new acts, as they were of following new trends.

===Producer and author===
While at KDGE, Gimarc produced and financed the twice-annual Tales From The Edge CD releases, eventually producing eleven volumes. All were loaded with unsigned local acts from North Texas, and many groups found this to be their first ever release on CD. The CDs typically sold out in a month or so. In all, over 100,000 Tales From The Edge CDs hit the streets of Dallas. https://www.discogs.com/label/81994-Reel-George-Productions

After leaving the station Gimarc also produced the Edge Home Movie, a music video collection hosted by Edge DJs, that was a free video rental via Blockbuster outlets in DFW. 1,000 units were produced each month, and there were about a dozen issues before the station lost interest in promoting videos from alternative bands that weren&#x27;t necessarily on their playlist yet.

In addition to his on-air work and CDs, Gimarc became the sole writer for &quot;Rotten Day&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio program starring John Lydon, which aired in over 50 markets. When the radio show, distributed by Album Network, concluded its run, John Lydon and Gimarc moved on to VH1 with the show &#x27;Rotten Television&#x27; While doing the irreverent program for VH1, Lydon also got to be a live host on the red carpet for the Grammy Awards, with Gimarc helping along with special material and props for the guests. Gimarc acted as consultant for the &quot;Time/Life&quot; and &quot;The History of Rock and Roll&quot; series, compiled several record collections and written liner notes for many record labels. He has also written several books, including &quot;Punk Diary 1970-1979&quot;, &quot;Punk Diary 1980-1982&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Hi Fi&quot;.

As a result of being a voracious record collector and remaining in Dallas for his entire career, Gimarc has amassed an enormous archive of Texas music stretching back over 100 years. On many occasions, North Texas alt bands have had long lost recordings presumed lost, returned to them in clear, digital restorations. His expertise in Texas Music has gained him a seat on the advisory board of the Texas Musicians Museum . Many items from his collection were on display there, including a field recorder used by Library of Congress historian Alan Lomax.

==24/7Comedy and Today&#x27;s Comedy==
In 2008 Gimarc began developing an All-Comedy radio format for AM &amp; FM with a partner launching it in Riverside, CA. in September 2010. In the two years that followed, 24-7 Comedy Radio grew to 20 affiliates across the US and Canada, as well as becoming a national channel on the new iHeart app. In July 2012 it was purchased by Clear Channel M+E and was rolled out on even more stations bringing the total by years end up to nearly 40 stations. Gimarc was Comedy Brand Manager for Clear Channel and ran the operation from Dallas with a small, tight staff. The entire crew was terminated in the summer of 2014 when the 24/7 Comedy brand was reduced to just a digital stream. At the same time, Gimarc launched his new FM &amp; AM stream Today&#x27;s Comedy brand which can be heard on the Audacy.com app as Comedy Now. https://www.audacy.com/stations/comedy-now

<text>Jumenbu (), is a fortress of the Ming Great Wall Shanxi Section, located in Datong city in Shanxi province, China.

Jumenbu is a fortress for guarding the Great Wall of China, and it is a part of the Great Wall defence system. Jumenbu is situated in a brae 2.5 km away from the Great Wall. It was designed to defend against invasion and harry the nomads of Mongolia. Its original name was Jumengbu, which literally means &quot;Mongol-resistant stronghold&quot;, but it was later renamed.

The fortress is not big, and has only a gate on the east with a &quot;wengcheng&quot; (barbican entrance to the fortress) on the east. The wall was built from earth with bricks on the surface.

<text>DJ? Acucrack is an electronic music duo based in Chicago, Illinois. DJ? Acucrack was formed by Jason Novak and Jamie Duffy as an Acumen Nation drum n&#x27; bass side project. The duo initially created the side project to &quot;kill time&quot; between releases for Acumen Nation, but their releases as Acucrack were so well received that the side project ended up taking precedence. Their first two releases — &quot;Nation State&quot; and &quot;Mutants of Sound&quot; — appeared on the CMJ RPM year end charts for 1998.

Their 2000 album, &quot;Sorted&quot;, peaked at #2 on the CMJ RPM Charts in the U.S. In 2004, DJ? Acucrack opened for KMFDM on their 20th Anniversary Tour.

In August 2005, DJ? Acucrack released a new album, &quot;Killing Mobius&quot;. In 2006, they toured with Front Line Assembly for their Artificial Soldier tour, which was cut short. Issues with the tour bus company have been cited for the cancellation.

Founding member Jamie Duffy died on June 21, 2012.

<doc id="1133834" wikidata="Q3219941" url="?curid=1133834" title="Education in Taiwan">
<text>The educational system in Taiwan is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. The system produces pupils with some of the highest test scores in the world, especially in mathematics and science. 

In 2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world&#x27;s best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils&#x27; scholastic performance. Taiwan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493, placing it seventh in the world and has one of the world&#x27;s most highly educated labor forces among OECD countries. Although current law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95 percent junior high school students go on to a senior vocational high school, trade school, junior college, or university.

In Taiwan, adhering to the Confucian paradigm for education where parents believe that receiving a good education is a very high priority for Taiwanese families and an important goal in their children&#x27;s life. Many parents in Taiwan believe that effort and persistence matters more than innate ability if their children want to receive better grades in school. These beliefs are shared by the teachers and guidance counselors and the schools as they regularly keep the parents abreast on their child&#x27;s overall academic performance in the school. Many parents have high expectations for their children, emphasize academic achievement and actively intervene in their children&#x27;s academic progress by making sure that their children receive top grades and would go on to great sacrifices including borrowing money to put their child through university.

Due to its role in promoting Taiwan&#x27;s economic development, high test results, and high university entrance rate, Taiwan&#x27;s education system has been praised. 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25 to 64 hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Furthermore, the education system has been criticized for its overemphasis on rote memorization and excessive academic pressure it places on students. Students in Taiwan are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers, and society in order to secure prestigious white collar job positions while eschewing vocational education, critical thinking, and creativity. With a narrow bandwidth of prestigious job positions and a far greater number of university graduates seeking them, many have been employed in lesser positions with salaries far below their expectations. Taiwan&#x27;s universities have also been criticized for not keeping up with the technological trends and employment demands in its fast moving job market referring to a skills mismatch cited by a number of self assessed and overeducated university graduates. In addition, the Taiwanese government has been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to create enough jobs to support the demands of the numerous unemployed university graduates.

==History==


The Dutch East India Company, the Ming Chinese loyalists under Koxinga, Qing China, and the Japanese all implemented education systems on Taiwan. Christianity was taught under Dutch rule. Taiwan also had many academies, such as Daodong Academy, Fongyi Academy, Huangxi Academy, Jhen Wen Academy, Mingxin Academy and Pingtung Academy.

In 1944–1945, the Republic of China under the Chinese Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai-shek took control of the island; the existing private school infrastructure was curtailed over suspicions of its political loyalty. After the retreat of the ROC to Taiwan in 1949, they sought to use public schools to assimilate the Taiwanese population; private schools, seen as an obstacle to this process, were suppressed. By 1954, however, the party yielded to calls for education reform, and began to revitalize and expand private schooling. The Nationalists used a number of measures (such as filling school boards with loyalists and careful control of state funding) to ensure that private schooling remained under state influence.

==Public education==
The public education system in Taiwan spans nursery schools through university. Public education has been compulsory from primary school through junior high school since 1968. In 2001 roughly 16% of the central budget was spent on education. In January 2011, President Ma announced plans to implement a full twelve-year compulsory education program by 2014. In addition, financial support for preschool education would begin, starting with fee waivers.

Access to high school and university is controlled by a series of national exams. Discipline in public schools of all levels is generally very tight with school uniforms and morning reveille being the norm. Students of all levels through high school are responsible for cleaning their own classrooms and areas around the school, cleanup time being a daily ritual. Corporal punishment is officially banned, but many reports suggest it is still practiced by many teachers, due in no small part to the fact that most parents support it.

The school year consists of two semesters. The fall semester begins in early September and runs till late January or early February. Winter vacation typically runs from three to four weeks around the Lunar New Year. Spring semester begins following the Lantern Festival in mid February and ends in late June. From middle school on, many schools hold &quot;optional supplementary classes&quot; during winter and summer vacation as well as after normal school hours. Despite the name, in many cases participation is compulsory. The language of instruction is Mandarin.

==School grades==
The school year is divided into two semesters. The first begins in the beginning of September and ends in January; the second begins in mid February and ends in late June.
The tertiary education and postgraduate education in Taiwan have different tracks and their years and grades varies.
In addition, special education, adult education, and continuing education also exist in Taiwan following similar systems mentioned above.

== National Education ==
The current national basic education in Taiwan is 12 years education. The implementation of this compulsory education replaces the old 9 years education.

The 12 years education policy was originally proposed in 1983, but was delayed for financial reasons.

===Elementary school===
Elementary schools span grades 1 through 6, classes are held from Monday through Friday, typically from 7:30 AM through 4 PM (or noon on Wednesdays). Subjects include:

*Mandarin: The official language of instruction.
*Mathematics: Mathematics education begins with the basics and reaches introductory algebra and geometry by the 6th grade.
*Science: Comprehensive science classes covering basic biology, physics, and chemistry.
*English: English is a compulsory subject within the mainstream school system from Grade 3 Elementary School and up.
*Native languages: Additional language classes in Taiwanese and Hakka Chinese are offered.
*Social studies
*Music
*Art

Like junior high schools, students are typically assigned to the elementary school closest to their registered place of residence. This leads some parents to file their children&#x27;s household registration with other relatives or friends for the purpose of sending their children to what are perceived as better schools.

===Junior high school===

Junior high school spans grades 7 through 9 and is the last half of compulsory education. Junior high students typically focus on preparing for the national senior high school entrance exams at the end of 9th grade. School ends around 5PM, but students often stay in school later for quizzes and additional exam preparations.

Subject matter covered includes:
*Literature: Classical and modern Chinese literature and poetry, composition and public speaking.
*Mathematics: Covers single and two variable algebra, geometry, proofs, trigonometry, and pre-calculus.
*English: Contains essential English grammar
*Science &amp; Technology
**Biology: Taken during first year, includes more in depth studies and lab work.
**Chemistry: Taken during second year. More rigorous introduction to atoms, molecule, and chemical reactions, including lab work.
**Physics: Taken during second year. More rigorous introduction to physical laws and equations, including lab work.
**Earth Science: Taken during third year.
**Technology: Taken during the whole three years. Introduce some basic technology in daily life.
*Social Studies
**Civics: Basic demotics, politics, and economics.
**History: Focus on the history of Taiwan and China during the first two years, and world history during third year.
**Geography: Contain introductive geography accompanied with geography of Taiwan during first year, geography of China and East Asia during second year, and the world geography during third year.
*Home economics &amp; crafts
*Art: Inclusive of three independent parts: Fine Art, Music, and Drama.
*PE
*Scout education: Outdoor survival skills.

At the end of their third year, students participate in the national senior high school entrance exams and are assigned to senior high schools based upon their scores. Students may also participate in a separate national vocational school entrance exam if they wish to attend vocational school. In both cases, public schools are usually the most popular while private schools have traditionally been viewed as a backup for those unable to score high enough for public schools.

Roughly 94.7% of junior high school students continue on to senior high or vocational school.

===Regular senior high school===
Senior high school spans grades 10 through 12, again the main goal of students is to score highly on the national university entrance exams at the end of their third year. The pace is just as, if not more intense than junior high school.

Discipline in educational institutions from high school and up (including vocational schools) is the responsibility of military officers stationed at the individual schools (as opposed to elementary and junior high school where teachers and school administrators were responsible for discipline). In addition to the normal subjects, students are also required to attend a military education class covering issues such as civil defense, military drills, national defense, and basic firearms. In the past, high (and vocational) school students were expected to take on civil defense duties in the event of national emergency. Boys and girls were trained to use firearms and hurl grenades.

In many high schools incoming students may select science or liberal arts tracks depending on where their interests lie. The different learning tracks are commonly referred to as groups. Group I consists of liberal arts students, Group II and Group III of science based students (the latter studies biology as an additional subject). Science based curriculum consists of more rigorous science and mathematics classes intended to prepare the student for a career in the sciences and engineering; the liberal arts track places a heavier emphasis on literature and social studies to prepare students for a future in those fields. Often, students in Group I are exempted to study science even if they wish to, and students in Group II are not required to take geography, civics and history.

Entrance to university is administered via two methods: by recommendations or by taking the national university entrance examination. For those that participate in recommendations, they have to take a national academic exam and select a list of majors that they are applying to. The first stage is a screening of exam results for eligibility and the second stage would be dependent on the conditions of individual departments selected. For those that did not choose to take the recommendations process, or have failed their applications, they have the choice to participate in the national university entrance exams after graduation in hopes of university admission. Students who graduate from a senior high school usually end up taking up the national university entrance examination to enter a general four year university. They can also apply to junior colleges, an institute of technology, or a university of science and technology as an alternative choice.

===Skill-based senior high school===
In June 2016, &quot;vocational high schools&quot; were renamed as skill-based senior high schools. Vocational training and related career choices are introduced through course electives in lower secondary school. Skill-based senior high schools are three-year institutions that are similar to regular senior high schools. Unlike regular senior high schools, they place a heavier emphasis on practical and vocational skills. These schools offer a variety of programs that cater to the needs of students with different abilities and skills. Skill-based senior high schools offer programs that are organized into six different categories: agriculture, industry, business, marine products, everyday life sphere, and art. Graduates of senior skill-based senior high schools can choose to enter the workforce, start their own business, or go on to higher education. Senior skill-based senior high school graduates can apply to junior colleges, institutes of technology, and universities of science and technology. They can also take the national university entrance exams to enter general four-year universities.

==Higher education==

===University===
University entrance is the traditional route taken by Taiwanese students to enter the gateway of higher education as it is by far the most prestigious form of higher education in Taiwan. Since 2008, the percentage of high school graduates entering university has exceeded 95 percent. The Taiwanese higher education system is similar to the American higher education system. Since the 1990s many trade schools and junior colleges have been &quot;promoted&quot; to university status as results of a series of educational reform, which can account for the Taiwan&#x27;s high university entrance rate. Even though a high score is desired as an admission criterion to the nations most esteemed and prestigious institutions, as consequences of such reforms, the job market is flooded with unemployed university graduates.

====Overview====
Taiwan has many universities, both public and private. Tuition is less expensive in public universities than in private universities, like in most western countries. Many public universities receive financial support from the government. There are currently five University alliances in Taiwan, intentionally modeled after other educational systems such as the University of California system. NTNU is the internationally top-ranked university for linguistics especially for foreigners interested in learning (advanced) Mandarin, as well as other institutes for serious Mandarin learning opportunities for foreigners.

Nowadays some private schools are supported by commercial groups or religious bodies (such as Fu Jen Catholic University, Tzu Chi University).

Engineering is popular, and engineering degrees account for over a quarter of the bachelor&#x27;s degrees awarded in Taiwan. It is also related to future employment opportunities because of the government policy focusing on high-tech manufacturing industries. See also: Engineering education in Taiwan

=====Public=====
Some of the highly regarded public universities in Taiwan include: (Research = Designated National Research University)

*North, Research
**National Taiwan University: Research, formerly Taihoku Imperial University, Taiwan&#x27;s representative public university, founded in Japanese era. Distinguished programs in all fields. AACSB accredited.

It is notable for having established the first graduate-level program in Conference Interpreting in Taiwan. The student body also consists of many international students.
* Soochow University: Well known for studies in Law, Accounting, foreign languages and literature and political science.

In contrast with junior high and high school, where students are pressured by the highly selective entrance exams, college life in Taiwan is generally seen as being rather relaxed. Graduate degrees from the U.S. and Europe are also highly prized with many students applying to foreign graduate schools after completing university (though the number has declined somewhat in recent years). An average of 13,000 university graduates per year choose to pursue graduate studies in the U.S.

====Founded by Japanese government (1895–1945)====
====Similarities with universities in China====
Many universities in Taiwan were originally established in Republic of China before the retreat of the ROC government from Mainland to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. Some of the universities who were originally established in the Mainland were reestablished in Taiwan. To avoid ambiguity, the ROC government generally added the &quot;National&quot; word in front of those universities in Taiwan to differentiate them with the ones in China.

====Teaching Excellence Universities Award====
The Ministry of Education in Taiwan started the Teaching Excellence Universities Award in 2006. Since the beginning of this award, only six universities have earned this honor every year.

====Medical school====
Medical school in Taiwan begins as an undergraduate major and lasts six years (six years for dentistry), with the final two years being hands on training at a teaching hospital. Graduates of medical school may elect to continue on to graduate school to pursue a doctoral degree.

====Law school (College of Law)====
There are no law schools in the sense of US law schools. Many universities have college of law or department of law, provide legal education as an undergraduate major and lasts for four years.

====Teacher training====
Most higher educational institutions offering programs in education. Such programs run four years, in addition to a half-year internship, with students receiving teaching credentials at the end of the program. They also have to take extra test for being a teacher in public school. While currently education programs are available in most institutes of tertiary education, prospective teachers typically go to a &quot;university of education&quot; if they want to teach primary school, and a &quot;normal university&quot; for secondary school. One exception is National Changhua University of Education, which, like normal universities, is renowned for its dedication to cultivating secondary school teachers.

===== Teachers&#x27; In-service Advancement Education Information &amp; Resources =====
With the implementation of reformation of education policy in Taiwan, in order to integrate the resources of teachers&#x27; in-service advancement education and to encourage teachers to participate in the in-service advancement education activities positively, the Ministry of Education established 12 regional teacher&#x27;s in-service advancement education centers in 2003. The National Kaohsiung Normal University (NKNU) was chosen as the general coordinator and was responsible for setting up, managing the Nationwide Teacher In-Service Education Information Web.

The Nationwide Teacher In-Service Education Information Web provides teachers with a communication platform for in-service teacher advancement education in Taiwan. That is to encourage teachers to have a continuous growth in teaching. The information of advancement activities and teachers’ participation records are shown by digital platform.

This network provides activities and individual&#x27;s learning records for K–12 teachers. This database-technology platform is in an electronic format to record teacher&#x27;s training progress and learning time. It establishes a regulating mechanism to integrate educational and administrative resources from education institutions and local authorized educational authorities respectively. That is for fulfilling the ideals of educational reform in an effective way.

The purposes of Nationwide Teacher In-service Advancement Education Information Web are as follows:

====Graduate school====
Each college in each university usually has their own graduate schools. In addition, the Taiwan International Graduate Program affiliated to Academia Sinica, the national academy of Taiwan, offers an English-language program in life sciences and physical sciences for both Taiwanese and international students.

Doctoral programs in Taiwan last two to seven years; most are four years.

====International programs====
International programs in Taiwan include bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD degree programs targeted at students from abroad.

===Vocational===
Vocational education in Taiwan is offered at junior colleges, institutes of technology, and at universities of science and technology where they can earn associate degrees to doctoral degrees. There are currently 87 institutions in Taiwan that offer vocational training. The Ministry of Education has been promoting vocational education and trying to persuade young Taiwanese to consider vocational schools as an alternative route to attending university.

====Junior colleges====
Junior colleges can be classified into five-year junior colleges and two-year junior colleges according to entry requirement. Since 2004, they offer associate degrees under Article 29 of the Junior College Law. Various subjects that are covered by junior colleges include marine resources, medicine, languages, home economics, and tourism and hospitality.

===== Five-year junior colleges =====
Students enter five-year junior colleges after graduating junior high school and passing a national exam. The curriculum is similar to that of vocational schools with the exception that five-year junior colleges run for two additional years. Students are required to complete 220 credit hours in these programs. Upon graduation, students are awarded an associate degree.

===== Two-year junior colleges =====
Two-year junior colleges offer advanced vocational training for graduates of vocational or senior high schools. Two-year junior college programs are attended by vocational senior high school graduates or graduates of a university of science and technology. They also accept students who have completed a vocational program during high school. Upon graduation, students are awarded an associate degree. Graduates of two-year junior colleges can choose to enter the workforce, start their own business, pursue additional studies at a two-year institute of technology program in a department of their choice or choose to pursue additional education at a four-year university.

====Institutes of Technology and Universities of Science and Technology====
Under the University Act, institutes of technology and universities of science and technology offer associate&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree programs. Both institutes of technology and universities of science and technology admit students who have graduated from a junior college or those holding a similar academic qualification and have undertaken an entrance exam. Two-year and four-year bachelor programs at institutes of technology and universities of science and technology. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is awarded to a student who has completed 128 credit hours after graduating from a four bachelor&#x27;s degree program. Two-year bachelor&#x27;s degree programs are for students who already hold an associate degree and have completed 80 credit hours. Master&#x27;s degrees require an additional 24 credits while PhD students have to complete an additional 18 credits along with a dissertation.

==Private education==
Private educational institutions are pervasive in Taiwan ranging from private schools at all levels to supplementary cram schools or &quot;buxiban&quot;.

===Cram schools===

With the intense pressure placed on students to achieve by parents, many students enroll in private after-school classes intended to supplement their regular education. These cram schools are an extremely large (and profitable) business in Taiwan and have been criticized by some as being the result of cultural overemphasis on academic achievement. Popular subjects in cram schools include English, mathematics, and physics. Cram schools are mostly popular amongst junior and senior high school students.

Classes are generally very orderly and controlled, with class sizes as high as 200 or so students in some well-known institutions. The quality of cram schools varies considerably. Some of the larger schools and chains write their own programs and produce their own textbooks.

===Kindergartens and preschool===
While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in Taiwan, private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects. Curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.

There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an ‘English only’ environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.

In October 2016, Education Minister Pan Wen-chung said that the Executive Yuan will allocated a budget of NT$6.2 billion to establish 1,000 kindergartens over the next four years so that it can raise the percentage of children enrollment by 30–40% by 2020.

=== 3+3 High School system ===
Following the new policy of the test to enter senior high school (the CAP test), it is now wildly believed by the parents that it is better and more convenient for their children to not need to worry about continuing education from junior to senior high school by continuing education at the same private school. This system allows for students to skip the CAP test, otherwise known as &quot;Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students&quot; and take only the university entrance exam after completion of senior high. Therefore, many senior high schools in Taiwan such as Private Nan Shan Senior High School started their own Junior departures.

==Other==
===Special Education Services in Taiwan===
 As Special Education Act was announced in 1984, students with special needs started to receive special education services in Taiwan. Two subgroups were further classified by professionals in special education, including students with difficulties and students with giftedness. In order to provide support that meet students needs, three main ways of special education services are provided: centralized special education class, decentralized resource room, and itinerant resource program. Students from age 2 to 22 can receive special education services in the process of assessment, placement and educational provision.

=== Nursing education ===

*Contain three kind of education entry, after the education done, the student will be gained the qualifications participle National exam for professional nurse license.

===Chinese as a second language===
Taiwan has long been and with the growing popularity of learning Chinese internationally, an ideal destination for learning the language.

See: List of Chinese language schools in Taiwan

===Students===
In 2015, there were 40,000 students from mainland China studying in Taiwan, in which 34,114 of them were short-term exchange students.

<doc id="1133837" wikidata="Q904015" url="?curid=1133837" title="Hyaluronidase">
<text>Hyaluronidases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the degradation of hyaluronic acid. Karl Meyer classified these enzymes in 1971, into three distinct groups, a scheme based on the enzyme reaction products. The three main types of hyaluronidases are two classes of eukaryotic endoglycosidase hydrolases and a prokaryotic lyase-type of glycosidase.

In humans, there are five functional hyaluronidases: HYAL1, HYAL2, HYAL3, HYAL4 and HYAL5 (also known as SPAM1 or PH-20); plus a pseudogene, HYAL6 (also known as HYALP1). The genes for HYAL1-3 are clustered in chromosome 3, while HYAL4-6 are clustered in chromosome 7. HYAL1 and HYAL2 are the major hyaluronidases in most tissues. GPI-anchored HYAL2 is responsible for cleaving high-molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which is mostly bound to the CD44 receptor. The resulting hyaluronic acid fragments of variable size are then further hydrolyzed by HYAL1 after being internalized into endo-lysosomes; this generates hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides.

Hyaluronidases are hyaluronoglucosidases (), i.e. they cleave the (1→4)-linkages between N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronate. The term hyaluronidase may also refer to hyaluronoglucuronidases (), which cleave (1→3)-linkages. In addition, bacterial hyaluronate lyases () may also be referred to as hyaluronidases, although this is uncommon.

== Use as a drug ==
===Medical uses===
By catalyzing the hydrolysis of hyaluronan, a constituent of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronidase lowers the viscosity of hyaluronan, thereby increasing tissue permeability. It is, therefore, used in medicine in conjunction with other drugs to speed their dispersion and delivery. Common applications are ophthalmic surgery, in combination with local anesthetics. It also increases the absorption rate of parenteral fluids given by hypodermoclysis, and is an adjunct in subcutaneous urography for improving resorption of radiopaque agents. Hyaluronidase is also used for extravasation of hyperosmolar solutions. Besides, hyaluronidase is a recommended antidote for vinca alkaloid overdose or extravasation. Hyaluronidase can be injected to dissolve hyaluronic acid type dermal fillers and is the best treatment option for those looking at dissolving lip filler or dealing with related complications.

===Purified and recombinant hyaluronidases===
Four different purified hyaluronidases have been approved for use in the United States, three of animal origin and one recombinant. They are indicated as adjuvants in subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, for increasing the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs, or for improving resorption of radiopaque agents, in subcutaneous urography.

The three naturally-sourced hyaluronidases are orthologs of human HYAL5 (PH20) obtained from testicular preparations. They are sold under the brand names Vitrase (ovine, FDA-approved in May 2004), Amphadase (bovine, October 2004) and Hydase (bovine, October 2005).

Human recombinant hyaluronidase (Hylenex Recombinant)—approved for use in the United States in December 2005—corresponds to the soluble fragment of human HYAL5 (PH20) produced in culture by genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding the enzyme.

===Combination treatments===
A human recombinant hyaluronidase kit, Hyqvia, was approved for use in the European Union in May 2013, and in the United States in September 2014. It is a dual vial unit with one vial of immune globulin infusion 10% (human) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase. It is an immune globulin with a recombinant human hyaluronidase indicated in the United States for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency in adults. This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies. In the European Union it is indicated as replacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0–18 years) in:
* Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production.
* Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are contra‑indicated.
* Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.
* Hypogammaglobulinaemia in patients pre‑ and post‑allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

A form of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) that uses Hylenex to allow for a far greater volume of SCIG to be administered than would normally be possible to administer subcutaneously, providing a form of SCIG that can be dosed on a monthly basis, a longer period of time than other forms of SCIG allow. HyQvia had a rate of systemic adverse effects higher than traditional subcutaneous forms of immunoglobulin injection, but lower than those typical in IVIG patients. Also in epidural lysis of adhesions for pain management.

Hyaluronidase is available in some fixed-dose combination drug products in the United States: rituximab/hyaluronidase (Rituxan Hycela), trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin Hylecta), daratumumab/hyaluronidase-fihj (Darzalex Faspro), pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase–zzxf (Phesgo).

In July 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.

Efgartigimod alfa/hyaluronidase (Vyvgart Hytrulo) was approved for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in the United States in June 2023.

Ocrelizumab/hyaluronidase-ocsq (Ocrevus Zunovo) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024.

Atezolizumab/hyaluronidase-tqjs (Tecentriq Hybreza) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024.

Nivolumab/hyaluronidase-nvhy (Opdivo Qvantig) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2024.

== Role in cancer ==

The role of hyaluronidases in cancer has been historically controversial due to contradictory observations, namely that levels of hyaluronidase (HYAL1/2) are increased in some cancers (colorectal, bladder, prostate, breast and brain), whereas low expression of HYAL1 is correlated with a decrease in survival of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The reason for this apparent contradiction is that both the accumulation of hyaluronic acid (due to increased hyaluronan synthase levels and decreased HYAL levels) and the degradation of hyaluronic acid into hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides by high HYAL levels result in increased tumor malignancy.

Elevated tissue expression of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase validates the hyaluronic acid-hyaluronidases urine test for bladder cancer. Limited data support a role of lysosomal hyaluronidases in metastasis, while other data support a role in tumor suppression. Other studies suggest no contribution or effects independent of enzyme activity. Non-specific inhibitors (apigenin, sulfated glycosaminoglycans) or crude enzyme extracts have been used to test most hypotheses, making data difficult to interpret. It has been hypothesized that, by helping degrade the extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor, hyaluronidases help cancer cells escape from primary tumor masses. However, studies show that removal of hyaluronan from tumors prevents tumor invasion. Hyaluronidases are also thought to play a role in the process of angiogenesis, although most hyaluronidase preparations are contaminated with large amounts of angiogenic growth factors.

== Role in pathogenesis ==
Some bacteria, such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, produce hyaluronidase as a means of using hyaluronan as a carbon source. It is often speculated that &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; pathogens use hyaluronidase as a virulence factor to destroy the polysaccharide that holds animal cells together, making it easier for the pathogen to spread through the tissues of the host organism, but no valid experimental data are available to support this hypothesis.

Hyaluronidases are found in the venom of certain lizards and snakes, as well as honeybees, where they are referred to as &quot;spreading factors&quot;, having a function akin to bacterial hyaluronidases.

== Role in immune response ==
White blood cells produce hyaluronidase to move more easily through connective tissue to get to infected sites.

== Role in sepsis and septic shock ==
Plasma hyaluronic acid is elevated in sepsis and septic shock and correlate with disease severity, but the effect on mortality shows conflicting results. Hyaluronidase, when injected into the circulation, results in the loss of glycocalyx and is therefore considered as a potential endogenous sheddase. However, plasma hyaluronidase activity is decreased in experimental as well as in clinical septic shock. Concomitant, the endogenous hyaluronidase inhibition in plasma was increased and may explain to certain extent the decreased plasma hyaluronidase activity.

== Role in fertilization ==
In mammalian fertilization, hyaluronidase is released by the acrosome of the sperm cell after it has reached the oocyte, by digesting hyaluronan in the corona radiata, thus enabling conception. Gene-targeting studies show that hyaluronidases such as PH20 are not essential for fertilization, although exogenous hyaluronidases can disrupt the cumulus matrix.

The majority of mammalian ova are covered in a layer of granulosa cells intertwined in an extracellular matrix that contains a high concentration of hyaluronan. When a capacitated sperm reaches the ovum, it is able to penetrate this layer with the assistance of hyaluronidase enzymes present on the surface of the sperm. Once this occurs, the sperm is capable of binding with the zona pellucida.

<doc id="1133843" wikidata="Q1132840" url="?curid=1133843" title="Zig zag (railway)">
<text>A railway zig zag or switchback is a railway operation in which a train is required to switch its direction of travel in order to continue its journey. While this may be required purely from an operations standpoint, it is also ideal for climbing steep gradients with minimal need for tunnels and heavy earthworks. For a short distance (corresponding to the middle leg of the letter &quot;Z&quot;), the direction of travel is reversed, before the original direction is resumed. Some switchbacks do not come in pairs, and the train may then need to travel backwards for a considerable distance.

A location on railways constructed by using a zig-zag alignment at which trains must reverse direction to continue is a reversing station.

One of the best examples is the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site railway in India, which has six full zig zags and three spirals.

== Advantages ==
Zig zags tend to be cheaper to construct because the grades required are discontinuous. Civil engineers can generally find a series of shorter segments going back and forth up the side of a hill more easily and with less grading than they can a continuous grade, which must contend with the larger scale geography of the hills to be surmounted.

== Disadvantages ==
Zig zags suffer from a number of limitations:
* The length of trains is limited to what will fit on the shortest stub track in the zig zag. For this reason, the Lithgow Zig Zag&#x27;s stubs were extended at great expense in 1908. Even then, delays were such that the zig zag had eventually to be bypassed by a new route, opened two years later.
* Reversing a locomotive-hauled train not purposely equipped for push-pull operation without first running the engine around to the rear of the train can be hazardous – although operating the train with two locomotives, one at each end (a practice known as &quot;topping-and-tailing&quot;), can mitigate the dangers.
* The need to stop the train after each segment, throw the switch, and then reverse means that progress through the zig zag is slow.
* Passenger cars with transverse seating force riders to travel in reverse for at least part of the journey, though this issue is largely solved by longitudinal seating on cars serving such routes.

== Hazards ==
If the wagons in a freight train are marshaled poorly, with a light vehicle located between heavier ones (particularly with buffer couplings), the move on the middle road of a zig zag can cause derailment of the light wagon.

<doc id="1133844" wikidata="Q2647277" url="?curid=1133844" title="2008 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 2008 United States Senate elections were held on November 4, 2008, with 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate being contested. 33 seats were up for regular elections; the winners were eligible to serve 6-year terms from January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2015, as members of Class 2. There were also 2 special elections, the winners of those seats would finish the terms that ended on January 3, 2013. The presidential election, which was won by Democrat Barack Obama, elections for all House of Representatives seats; elections for several gubernatorial elections; and many state and local elections occurred on the same date.

Going into these elections, the Senate consisted of 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 2 Independents who caucused with the Democrats, giving the Democratic caucus the slightest 51–49 majority. Of the seats up for election in 2008, 23 were held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats. The Republicans, who openly conceded early on that they would not be able to regain the majority in this election, lost 8 seats. Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbents in Alaska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, and, after a lengthy recount process, Minnesota. Additionally, they won Republican-held open seats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia. 

Each major party has Hill committees that work to support its candidates for the House and Senate, chiefly by providing funds. On the Senate side, the committees are the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). In this cycle, the DSCC was more successful at fundraising. As of June 30, 2008, data from the Federal Election Commission showed the NRSC with $24.6 million on hand, as compared with the DSCC&#x27;s $43 million. The NRSC chair, senator John Ensign, took the unusual step of chastising the Republican Senators who, like him, were not facing re-election, and who he thought should have done more to help raise money for their colleagues.

This election cycle was the second cycle in a row in which no seats switched from Democratic to Republican, and the first since 1990 in which the Democrats retained all their seats. In addition, this was the largest Democratic Senate gain since 1986, where they also won 8 seats. These elections marked the first time since 1964 in which a Democratic presidential candidate who won the White House had a Senate coattail effect. As of 2024, this is the last time Democrats won U.S. Senate seats in Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Dakota. 

Along with 2 independents who caucus with them, Democrats held at least 58 seats as a result of the elections. The April 2009 party switch of Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter from Republican to Democrat and the July 2009 resolution of the Minnesota election in favor of Democrat Al Franken increased the Democratic majority to 60–40 (briefly providing the Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, and thus they were able to hypothetically override any filibusters). Republicans gained a seat in a January 2010 special election in Massachusetts, thereby making the balance 59–41 before the start of the next election cycle.

== Race summary ==

=== Special elections during the 110th Congress ===
In these special elections, the winner was seated during 2008 or before January 3, 2009, sorted by election date, then state, then class.

=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 2009; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

=== Special elections during the next Congress ===
There were no special elections in 2009.

== Closest races ==
In nine races the margin of victory was under 10%. However, Georgia proceeded to a runoff election where the Republican candidate won by over 10%.

South Dakota was the tipping point state, decided by a margin of 25.0%.

== Final pre-election predictions ==
Several sites and individuals published predictions of competitive seats. These predictions looked at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent was running for re-election) and the other candidates, and the state&#x27;s partisan lean (reflected in part by the state&#x27;s Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assigned ratings to each seat, indicating the predicted advantage that a party had in winning that seat. Most election predictors used:
* &quot;tossup&quot;: no advantage
* &quot;tilt&quot; (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as &quot;lean&quot;
* &quot;lean&quot;: slight advantage
* &quot;likely&quot;: significant, but surmountable, advantage
* &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;: near-certain chance of victory

== Alabama ==

Alabama senator Jeff Sessions sought re-election to a third term. Johnny Swanson announced his candidacy in March 2006 for the Democratic nomination.

Despite voting heavily for Bush in 2004, Alabama still had a strong Democratic presence; Democrats controlled majorities of both chambers in the state legislature. Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Ron Sparks appeared to be preparing for a run, but on June 12, 2007, Sparks announced that he would not seek the Senate seat, in order to avoid a primary battle with state senator Vivian Davis Figures. Figures has won elections in the Republican-leaning Mobile area. In the Democratic primary, Figures won the nomination and face Sessions in November.

Not on the ballot, but running a write-in campaign, was Darryl W. Perry, the 2004 Libertarian Party nominee for Pennsylvania State Treasurer and 2007 candidate for Mayor of Birmingham, Alabama. Perry was endorsed by Alabama Statesmen, Boston Tea Party, and Christians for Life and Liberty.

Sessions defeated Figures, taking 63% of the vote to Figures&#x27;s 37%









== Alaska ==











Dispelling rumors that he would retire due to advanced age (he was 84 years old on election day) and ongoing federal investigations into his conduct, senator Ted Stevens filed papers for re-election for an eighth term.

An ex-oil company executive, Bill Allen, paid for part of the renovation costs on Stevens&#x27;s personal residence. The FBI investigated the remodeling of Stevens home by Veco Corp., which is part of a broader corruption investigation involving Stevens&#x27;s son, former State Senate President Ben Stevens. Two former Veco executives have pleaded guilty to paying the younger Stevens $242,000 in bribes. On July 30, 2007, the IRS and FBI raided Stevens&#x27;s home in Alaska. On September 14, 2007, former Veco CEO Bill Allen testified at the trial of former State House Speaker Pete Kott that Veco paid people working to double the size of Stevens&#x27;s home.

On July 29, 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Stevens on seven felony counts for making false statements, and on October 26, a jury found Stevens guilty on all charges.

The Democratic candidate was Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich, the son of popular former Democratic Representative Nick Begich. Begich announced his candidacy for the Senate seat on April 22, 2008.

On October 19, 2007, the AP reported that despite the allegations and FBI probe, several veteran GOP Senators—including Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), and Kit Bond (R-MO)—donated enough money to Stevens&#x27;s re-election campaign to make it one of Stevens&#x27;s most successful fund raising quarters ever.

Stevens&#x27;s conviction on seven felony counts of corruption damaged his re-election bid, coming just over a week before the election, though Stevens appealed the conviction. Nevertheless, Stevens was narrowly ahead in the vote count after election day, with only about two-thirds of all votes counted. It only became clear Begich had prevailed when early votes, absentee ballots, and questioned ballots were counted.

On November 18, the race was called for Begich, who won with 47.8% to Stevens&#x27;s 46.5%. Stevens was the most senior U.S. Senator to ever lose re-election, defeating Warren Magnuson&#x27;s 1980 record. As of 2023, Stevens still holds this record.

On April 1, 2009, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, citing serious prosecutorial misconduct during the trial, decided to drop all charges against Stevens—an action that vacated his conviction.
== Arkansas ==



Despite being a first-term senator in a state George W. Bush won twice, Democrat Mark Pryor faced no opposition from Republicans in his re-election bid. Although Bush carried the state twice, Arkansas Democrats swept the seven state races held in the 2006 general election. Pryor is the son of longtime U.S. senator and former Arkansas Governor David Pryor. It was rumored that Lt. Governor Bill Halter would challenge Pryor in the primary, but Halter declined to file as a candidate. Rebekah Kennedy of the Green Party was Pryor&#x27;s only opposition. Pryor won on election day, with 79.53% of the vote. Kennedy took 20.47%.
== Colorado ==








On January 15, 2007, incumbent senator Wayne Allard (R) announced he would not seek re-election, honoring his pledge to serve no more than two terms.

Former Representative Bob Schaffer of Fort Collins was the Republican nominee. Former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway was rumored to be considering a run, but declined to do so. Other possible Republican candidates included former Congressman Scott McInnis and Colorado Attorney General John Suthers.

The Democratic nominee was 2nd district Congressman Mark Udall of Boulder who announced on January 15, 2007, that he would seek the seat and did not draw significant primary opposition.

Other candidates included Bob Kinsey of Denver as the Green Party nominee, Douglas &quot;Dayhorse&quot; Campbell as the American Constitution Party&#x27;s nominee, and Independent candidate Buddy Moore, unaffiliated any party.

On Election Day, Udall defeated Schaffer 53% to 43%.
== Delaware ==



On August 23, 2008, the Democratic nominee for president, Barack Obama, announced that Biden would be joining him on the ticket as the vice presidential nominee. Delaware law allowed Biden to run for vice president and senator at the same time, so he would have kept the Senate seat if the presidential ticket had lost. In 1988 and 2000, the Democratic vice presidential nominees Lloyd Bentsen and Joe Lieberman, ran similarly for their seat in Texas and Connecticut, respectively. On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidential election, making Biden the next VP. Biden vacated his senate seat shortly after the election, allowing for the Governor of Delaware to appoint a successor. There was speculation as to whether the outgoing Governor, Ruth Ann Minner, or the incoming Governor-elect Jack Markell would make the appointment, and if Biden&#x27;s son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden would receive the appointment. On November 24, 2008, Governor Minner appointed Biden&#x27;s longtime Chief of Staff Ted Kaufman to fill the seat. Kaufman subsequently announced that he would not seek election to a full term in 2010, effectively making him a caretaker. Biden&#x27;s Republican opponent in the Senate race, conservative political commentator Christine O&#x27;Donnell, tried to make an issue of Biden&#x27;s dual campaigns, claiming that serving his constituents is not important to him. 

Biden was re-elected with 65% of the vote, or 257,484 votes. O&#x27;Donnell received 140,584 votes (35% of the vote).
== Georgia ==













In the 2008 election, first-term incumbent Republican senator Saxby Chambliss was opposed primarily by Democrat Jim Martin, as well as third-party candidates, including Libertarian Allen Buckley and Eleanor Garcia of the Socialist Workers Party.

Martin, current Georgia Commissioner of Human Resources, former member of the Georgia General Assembly, Vietnam War veteran, and 2006 candidate for lieutenant governor, secured the Democratic nomination after defeating DeKalb County CEO Vernon Jones by a 59% to 41% margin in the August 5 run-off election.

In December 2007, Chambliss had an approval rating of 53% and a disapproval rating of 34% according to Strategic Vision, a Republican polling firm. For most of the campaign, Chambliss maintained a comfortable lead in most polls. However, in the weeks leading up to the 2008 general election, polls showed the race tightening, reflecting a general nationwide trend.

On November 4, 2008, Chambliss received 49.8% of the vote, with Martin about 3% behind and Buckley receiving 3% of the vote. However, Georgia law stated that if no candidate receives a simple majority of the popular vote, then the election will be decided in a run-off. On December 2, 2008, Chambliss won the run-off with 57% of vote to Martin&#x27;s 43%.
== Idaho ==












On September 1, 2007, senator Larry Craig announced his intent to resign from the Senate effective September 30, 2007. The announcement followed by just six days the disclosure that he had pleaded guilty on August 1, 2007, to a reduced misdemeanor charge arising out of his arrest on June 11 at the Minneapolis airport for soliciting sex with a man in the restroom. Craig found almost no support among Republicans in his home state or Washington. On October 4, 2007, senator Craig announced he will not seek re-election, but would remain in office until the end of his term.

Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch was the Republican candidate; U.S. Army veteran and former congressman Larry LaRocco was the Democratic candidate. Risch and LaRocco ran against each other in the 2006 Lieutenant Governor race, which Risch won by a wide margin. Libertarian Kent Marmon also ran. The last Democratic senator from Idaho was Frank Church, who was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1980 after serving four terms.

Risch won the election with approximately 58% of the vote.
== Illinois ==








Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin remained favored in Illinois. He sought to be re-elected in a state that has steadily become more Democratic since 1992. CQpolitics.com rated the contest as &quot;safe Democrat&quot;.

Physician Steve Sauerberg of La Grange won the February 5 Republican primary. Kathy Cummings, a retired special education teacher was nominated via convention by the Green Party. Chad Koppie, a retired airline pilot and vice-chairman of the Illinois Center Right Coalition, was the nominee of the Constitution Party.

Durbin won with 68% of the vote. Sauerberg had 29%.
== Iowa ==








In a state that had been trending to the Democratic party recently, senator Tom Harkin faced the Republican nominee, small business owner Christopher Reed, whom he defeated with 63% of the vote to Reed&#x27;s 37%.
== Kansas ==








Senator Pat Roberts sought re-election to a third term. Although Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, former Democratic Congressman and army veteran Jim Slattery was nominated to run against Roberts. Pat Roberts currently has an approval rating of 56%.

Roberts was re-elected with 60% to Slattery&#x27;s 36%.
== Kentucky ==









Democrats made Senate Minority Leader, four-term senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky a target due to his leadership of Senate Republicans and his ties to President Bush, as well as his mediocre approval rating in the state, which was below 50%.

Businessman and U.S. Army veteran Bruce Lunsford, who lost the 2007 Democratic gubernatorial primary to Governor Steve Beshear, was the Democratic nominee.

Once thought to be secure in his re-election, McConnell&#x27;s lead had shrunk dramatically thanks to the financial crisis and polling showed the race tightening between him and Lunsford. Nevertheless, McConnell was re-elected by a margin of 53% to 47%.
== Louisiana ==




Incumbent Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996 following a recount and was narrowly re-elected in 2002 in a runoff election. Since those elections, Democrats have had to endure the loss of some reliable voters because Hurricane Katrina dispersed many African-Americans from New Orleans, although the vast majority still live within Louisiana. The state has become more Republican over the past 12 years. Louisiana elected David Vitter in 2004, the state&#x27;s first Republican senator since Reconstruction, as well as Republican Bobby Jindal as the first Indian-American Governor in the country&#x27;s history in 2007. Louisiana&#x27;s electoral votes easily went to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.

On August 27, 2007, state Treasurer John Neely Kennedy announced he was switching parties from Democrat to Republican. On November 29, after being personally recruited by Vitter and former Bush administration official Karl Rove, Kennedy announced plans to challenge Landrieu in 2008.

In the end, Landrieu was re-elected with 52% of the vote, Kennedy having 46%.
== Maine ==






In Maine, Susan Collins sought a third term in the Senate. She has maintained a high approval rating, and also in her favor is the landslide re-election of Maine&#x27;s senior Senator, Olympia Snowe, who had the largest margin of victory of any GOP Senate candidate - besides the largely unopposed Richard Lugar (R-IN) - in the 2006 election cycle. Collins was re-elected with 58% of the vote in 2002 over State Sen. Chellie Pingree. Fellow senator Joe Lieberman, citing his status as an independent, endorsed Collins in her 2008 re-election bid.

On May 8, 2007, Rep. Tom Allen (ME-1) announced his candidacy on his website . He had already expressed interest in running and had been building the apparatus necessary to wage a Senate campaign.

Collins won on election day with 61% of the vote, compared to 39% for Allen.
== Massachusetts ==






Incumbent John Kerry sought another Senate term in Massachusetts. Republican author and conservative activist Jerome Corsi, known for his public criticism of Kerry, had stated that he would run for the seat in 2008 but later changed his mind. Jim Ogonowski, a retired Air Force pilot who was closely defeated by now-Representative Niki Tsongas in a 2007 special election, was running against Kerry. but failed to obtain the required candidacy signatures. The Republican challenger turned out to be Jeff Beatty, an ex-Army Delta Force officer who garnered 30% of the vote in a challenge to Democratic Congressman Bill Delahunt in 2006. Kerry was challenged by defense attorney Edward O&#x27;Reilly for the Democratic nomination, winning 69% of the vote to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s 31%.

Kerry won with 66% of the vote to Beatty&#x27;s 31%. Libertarian Robert J. Underwood had 3%.
== Michigan ==





With the Democratic Party takeover of Capitol Hill in the 2006 midterm elections, senator Carl Levin had become one of the most powerful people in Washington as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was expected to easily win re-election.

Challenging Levin were Republican State Representative Jack Hoogendyk, Green candidate Harley G. Mikkelson, US Taxpayers&#x27; candidate Mike Nikitin, Libertarian professor Scotty Boman, and Natural Law&#x27;s candidate Doug Dern.

Levin won re-election with 63% of the vote, to Hoogendyk&#x27;s 34%.
== Minnesota ==











2007 year-end reports filed with the Federal Election Commission showed that Al Franken had raised $7.04 million through December 31, 2007, while Norm Coleman had raised $6.24 million. Year-end cash on hand was $6.04 million for Coleman and $3.10 million for Franken.















The 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota featured first-term Republican incumbent senator Norm Coleman, Democrat Al Franken, a comedian and radio personality, and former U.S. senator Dean Barkley, a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota.

A December 2007 poll showed Coleman&#x27;s approval rating among Minnesota voters at 53%. The seat was heavily targeted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee because of Minnesota&#x27;s Democratic leanings and recent Democratic gains in national and statewide elections. These factors, coupled with a national political climate favorable to Democrats, made the Minnesota Senate race one of the most competitive and closely watched of the cycle.

Franken announced his candidacy on February 14, 2007, more than 20 months before the election. Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, a professor at the University of St. Thomas (St. Paul, Minnesota), joined the race in October 2007. Attorney Mike Ciresi, an unsuccessful candidate in the 2000 Democratic U.S. Senate primary, was considered a serious candidate, but withdrew from the race on March 10, 2008, clearing the path for Franken to secure the party&#x27;s nomination.

Barkley, who had briefly been appointed Senator after the death of Paul Wellstone in 2002, ran under the banner of the Independence Party, the largest third party in Minnesota. He was included in most of the debates and ultimately received 15% of the vote in the general election, a strong showing for a third-party candidate. It is not clear whether Barkley detracted more votes from Coleman or Franken.

Polls over the course of the campaign indicated that the race was very competitive, with many polls showing Franken and Coleman virtually tied or within the margin of error, as well as several polls showing each candidate with a significant lead at one point or another. The presence of a serious third-party candidate further complicated matters.

On November 4, 2008, Coleman received 1,211,590 votes to Franken&#x27;s 1,211,375 votes, a margin of 215 votes, far less than 0.1%, thereby triggering an automatic recount. Barkley received 437,404 votes, about 15% of total votes cast.

On January 3, 2009, with the recount apparently completed, Franken had an unofficial lead of 225 votes, but former senator Coleman&#x27;s attorneys contested the official results in the courts. During the recount process, Minnesota was represented by only one senator, Amy Klobuchar.

On April 13, 2009, a three-judge panel ruled that Al Franken received the most votes in Minnesota&#x27;s 2008 Senate race and ruled against Coleman&#x27;s claims on all counts. Coleman appealed this decision. On June 30, 2009, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Al Franken received the most votes, and Norm Coleman conceded defeat after the ruling, allowing Al Franken to be Senator-elect of Minnesota. Franken was sworn in as Minnesota&#x27;s junior senator on July 7.
== Mississippi ==
=== Mississippi (regular) ===
Incumbent Republican Thad Cochran announced that he would seek re-election for a sixth term. Cochran, who has not faced serious opposition since he was re-elected in 1984, faced Democratic state Representative Erik R. Fleming, whom he defeated with 61% of the vote.




=== Mississippi (special) ===
Roger Wicker, formerly the representative of Mississippi&#x27;s 1st congressional district, was appointed by Governor Haley Barbour on December 31, 2007, to fill the vacancy caused by the December 18 resignation of Trent Lott. It had been speculated that Lott wished to resign before a new lobbying reform law, effective the first day of 2008, took effect; having resigned before the end of 2007, Lott may become a lobbyist in 2009 instead of 2010. Controversy arose when Barbour called for the special election to be held on the same day as the general election. As a result, Mississippi&#x27;s Attorney General Jim Hood challenged Barbour in court, claiming that the special election needed to be held within 100 days of Lott&#x27;s resignation, as per state law. Initially, a Mississippi Circuit Court judge sided with Hood, ruling that the election take place on or before March 19, 2008. However, Barbour filed an appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which overturned the earlier ruling and set the special election for November 4, 2008.

Democratic former Governor Ronnie Musgrove challenged Wicker. Another Democrat, former Congressman Ronnie Shows, also filed to run, but he withdrew in February 2008 and endorsed Musgrove. Wicker beat Musgrove 55% to 45%.




== Montana ==

Senator Max Baucus was a popular Democrat in Montana, representing a state that has long been fairly Republican but also receptive to Democrats in state and local elections. President Bush won Montana by more than 20 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Montana also had a popular Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and a newly elected Democratic junior senator, Jon Tester. Baucus was not expected to face a significant challenge from the 85-year-old Republican nominee, Bob Kelleher, who surprised observers by winning the June 3 Republican primary despite supporting a number of positions that put him to the political left of Baucus, such as nationalization of the American oil and gas industry.

Baucus easily won re-election, taking 73% of the vote, with Kelleher taking 27%.









== Nebraska ==

In Nebraska, incumbent Republican Chuck Hagel chose to retire rather than run for a third term.

Former Governor Mike Johanns, who recently resigned as Agriculture Secretary, was the Republican nominee, having defeated opponent Pat Flynn 87–13 in the primary. Scott Kleeb, 2006 candidate for Nebraska&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, defeated businessman Tony Raimondo, a former Republican, by a wide margin in the Democratic primary.

Nebraska state Green Party Co-Chairman Steve Larrick was also a candidate, as was Kelly Rosberg of the Nebraska Party.

Johanns won, taking 58% of the vote, with Kleeb taking 40%.












== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican John E. Sununu represented the swing state of New Hampshire. The state traditionally leaned Republican, but John Kerry from neighboring Massachusetts narrowly won the state in the 2004 Presidential election. New Hampshire also saw major Democratic gains in the 2006 elections, when Democrats took both of the previously Republican-held House seats, the gubernatorial race with a record vote share of 74%, and majorities in the State House and Senate, giving them concurrent control of both bodies for the first time since 1874. However, New Hampshire had not elected a Democratic United States senator since 1975.

Sununu&#x27;s 2002 opponent, former Governor Jeanne Shaheen, decided to run and was generally considered to be a very formidable challenger. Three consecutive monthly Rasmussen Reports poll showed Shaheen defeating Sununu by 49% to 41%. Prior to Shaheen&#x27;s entry, Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand, Katrina Swett, wife of former Democratic congressman Richard Swett, and former astronaut Jay Buckey had announced that they were running for the Democratic nomination. After Shaheen&#x27;s entry, however, all three withdrew and endorsed the former governor.

On election day, Shaheen defeated Sununu, 52% to 45%.








== New Jersey ==

Incumbent Democrat Frank Lautenberg sought re-election in 2008, though he was 84. In the Primary, Lautenberg soundly defeated Representative Rob Andrews (NJ-1) by a margin of 62% to 32%. In November 2006, the senator had the lowest approval rating of any Democrat running for re-election in 2008 (with 39% approving and 45% disapproving), with his approval standing only at 42% as of September 2007 with voters saying he does not deserve re-election 46%-36%. The Republican nominee was former Congressman and 1996 senatorial candidate Dick Zimmer.

Sara Lobman of the Socialist Workers Party and Independent Anthony Fisher were also declared candidates. Furthermore, in the wake of the financial crisis, Carl Peter Klapper entered the race as a write-in candidate.

Lautenberg won re-election, winning 56%-42%.









== New Mexico ==

While senator Pete Domenici had declared that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, he changed his mind and announced on October 4, 2007, that he was retiring at the end of his current term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he was to be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici&#x27;s role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.

Tom Udall, the popular Representative from New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd District, was the Democratic nominee. The Republican nominee was Rep. Steve Pearce, who represented the more conservative southern part of the state.

When asked whether the Republicans were abandoning their hopes of holding onto Domenici&#x27;s seat, senator John Ensign, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded that &quot;You don&#x27;t waste money on races that don&#x27;t need it or you can&#x27;t win.&quot;

Udall won the election with 61% of the vote, with Pearce taking 39%.







== North Carolina ==

In North Carolina, there had been rumors that senator Elizabeth Dole would retire from the Senate and run for governor, but she said in 2006 that she intended to run for re-election. There was early speculation that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley might be pressured into running against her but this did not come to pass. The Democratic nominee was state senator Kay Hagan, who defeated Jim Neal and Dustin Lassiter in the Democratic primary. A Rasmussen poll released May 11, 2008, showed Hagan leading Dole by a statistically insignificant margin, 48% - 47%, suggesting a competitive race. Hagan&#x27;s poll numbers continued to best Dole&#x27;s, however, and Hagan defeated Dole by a wider than expected margin of 53% to 44%.









== Oklahoma ==

In Oklahoma, senator Jim Inhofe announced that he would seek a third full term. A September 2007 poll put Inhofe&#x27;s approval rating at 47%, with 41% disapproving of his performance. Inhofe&#x27;s opponent was State senator Andrew Rice. Inhofe was re-elected, 57% to 39%.









== Oregon ==

Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon ran for a third term. He defeated ophthalmologist Gordon Leitch in the May 20 Republican primary. Smith faced Democratic Oregon House of Representatives Speaker Jeff Merkley in the November general election. Merkley beat longtime Democratic activist Steve Novick and three other candidates in a hotly contested primary.

In a July 16, 2008, poll, Merkley overtook Smith for the first time 43% to 41%.

On November 6, 2008, Jeff Merkley was projected the winner of the contest, with 48.9% to Smith&#x27;s 45.6%. Gordon Smith formally conceded soon afterward.










== Rhode Island ==

In Rhode Island, Democratic senator Jack Reed had an approval rating of 66% in November 2006. &quot;National Journal&quot; has declared that &quot;Reed is probably the safest incumbent of the 2008 cycle&quot;. Reed&#x27;s opponent was Robert Tingle, a pit manager at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, whom Reed defeated in his re-election campaign in 2002.

Reed won the election, with 73% of the vote.






== South Carolina ==

Senator Lindsey Graham, as a popular Republican incumbent in strongly conservative South Carolina, had been considered unlikely to be vulnerable to a Democratic challenge. Graham&#x27;s support for a compromise immigration bill, however, drew an angry response from many South Carolina conservatives, who recruited Buddy Witherspoon, a former South Carolina Republican Party leader, to challenge Graham for the nomination. Graham easily bested Witherspoon in the June 10 primary.

First-time candidate Bob Conley, an airline pilot, was the Democratic nominee. Conley, whose victory in the Democratic primary over Michael Cone was a surprise, is a former Republican who supported Ron Paul in 2008 and campaigned as the more conservative candidate on some issues, notably illegal immigration and the bailout of Wall Street.

The South Carolina Working Families Party had also nominated Michael Cone. South Carolina&#x27;s election law allows for electoral fusion. This was the first time the party nominated a candidate for statewide office. However, because he lost the Democratic primary, Cone was not listed on the ballot under the state&#x27;s sore loser law.

Graham easily won re-election with 58% of the vote to Conley&#x27;s 42%.







== South Dakota ==


In South Dakota, senator Tim Johnson&#x27;s seat was considered a top GOP target in 2008, considering Johnson&#x27;s narrow 524-vote victory in 2002 over then-Representative and current U.S. senator John Thune, as well as his recent health problems. Johnson underwent surgery in December 2006 for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation and was discharged from the hospital on April 30, 2007. On October 19, 2007, Johnson formally announced that he was seeking re-election. According to a November 2006 SurveyUSA poll, Johnson had an approval rating of 70%, with just 26% disapproving of his performance, making him an early favorite despite the state&#x27;s Republican lean.

Republicans were unsuccessful in persuading Governor Mike Rounds and former Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby to run. State Representative Joel Dykstra announced his candidacy on July 5, 2007. Other Republicans included Charles Lyonel Gonyo and Sam Kephart. Dykstra won the Republican primary on June 3.

Johnson was re-elected, with 62.5% to Dykstra&#x27;s 37.5%. This seat was the tipping point state in the 2008 senate elections.





== Tennessee ==

Former Governor and U.S. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander was elected in 2002 to succeed retiring senator Fred Thompson. He has announced he will seek a second term in 2008. He was unopposed in the Republican primary.

Former Chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party Bob Tuke was the Democratic nominee, defeating Businessman Gary Davis 30% to 23%. Knox County Clerk Mike Padgett received 20% of the vote.

2006 Green Party Senate nominee Chris Lugo originally announced as a Democrat but dropped out of the Democratic race before the filing deadline. He filed as an independent and was subsequently named as the Green Party nominee Edward Buck was also in the race.

Daniel Lewis ran as a Libertarian candidate for the United States Senate. He was certified March 3, 2008, by the Tennessee Division of Elections as having achieved ballot access for the November 4, 2008, election as a candidate for United States Senate. The Libertarian Party of Tennessee officially selected Daniel Lewis as their candidate for United States Senate on Saturday March 8, 2008, at their annual convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Mr. Lewis was serving as the chairman of the Libertarian Party of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County. He ran for the Tennessee House in 2004.

Also reported to be in the race are David &quot;None of the Above&quot; Gatchell a ballot activist &amp; frequent candidate and Emory &quot;Bo&quot; Heyward, a software company employee, conservative activist &amp; 2006 candidate.

Alexander won the election with 65% of the vote.










== Texas ==

Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, but according to pre-election Rasmussen polling, senator John Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. Texas House of Representatives member and Afghanistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn&#x27;s Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega by a narrow four percentage points - 47% to 43%.

Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, Texas, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican primary.

There were three Libertarians, including 2006 LP senate nominee Scott Jameson, running for their party&#x27;s nomination. In addition, the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate David B. Collins.

In the end, John Cornyn won re-election, 55%-43%







== Virginia ==


John Warner announced on August 31, 2007, that he would not seek re-election for another term. Former Governor Jim Gilmore, who dropped out of the 2008 presidential election, was the Republican nominee for the seat.
Popular Democratic former Governor Mark Warner (no relation) was the Democratic nominee for the race. Polling showed him as a strong favorite to win the seat.

When asked whether the Republicans were abandoning their hopes of holding onto Warner&#x27;s seat, senator John Ensign, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded that &quot;You don&#x27;t waste money on races that don&#x27;t need it or you can&#x27;t win.&quot;

In one of the first senate races called on election day, Warner won, taking 65% of the vote, with Gilmore winning 34%. Since Democrat Jim Webb had defeated incumbent Republican George Allen for Virginia&#x27;s other Senate seat in 2006, Virginia&#x27;s senate delegation flipped from entirely Republican to entirely Democratic in just two years.






== West Virginia ==

Senator Jay Rockefeller, great-grandson of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, sought a fifth term representing West Virginia. Even though West Virginia is a historically Democratic state, in which the party had a 50-32% edge in party affiliation over the Republicans in the 2004 elections, the state party is more conservative than the national party, giving its votes to President George W. Bush in that election and in 2000. Democrats Sheirl Fletcher and Billy Hendricks challenged Rockefeller in the primary but were defeated. The Republican nominee was Jay Wolfe of Salem, a former State Senator.

Rockefeller handily won on election day, being re-elected with 64% of the vote. Wolfe had 36%.








== Wyoming ==
=== Wyoming (regular) ===
Incumbent Republican Mike Enzi was considered likely to be re-elected without significant opposition for a third term in strongly Republican Wyoming. His Democratic opponent was Chris Rothfuss, a professor at the University of Wyoming and a chemical engineer, nanotechnologist, and diplomat. Pre-election polling indicated that Enzi led Rothfuss by 24%.

Enzi won another term, 76%-24%.








=== Wyoming (special) ===

Republican John Barrasso was appointed by Governor Dave Freudenthal (D) on June 22, 2007, to fill the senate seat of Republican Craig L. Thomas, who died on June 4. Wyoming law requires that the interim senator be affiliated with the same political party as the departed senator. Barrasso ran in the November 4, 2008, special election, held on the day of the 2008 presidential election, to serve out the remainder of Thomas&#x27;s term, which expires in January 2013.

On the Democratic side, Casper City Councilman Keith Goodenough announced his candidacy. In the primary on August 19, Goodenough was defeated by a political newcomer, Gillette defense attorney Nick Carter, who became Barrasso&#x27;s opponent in the general election.

Barrasso won on Election Day, taking 73% of the vote and winning every county in the state.

<text>Donald Warder Orchard (born April 11, 1946) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1995, and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon.

The son of Warder Franklin John Orchard and Muriel Bernice King, he was born in Miami, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He worked as a farmer after graduation, becoming active in the Miami Agricultural Society and the local Masonic organization. In 1969, he married Edna Jane Simpson.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, in the safe Conservative seat of Pembina. He was re-elected in this riding in the elections of 1981, 1986, 1988 and 1990, each time by a comfortable margin.

The Progressive Conservatives won the 1977 election under Sterling Lyon, and Orchard was appointed Minister of Highways and Transport on November 15, 1979. He was also appointed Chairman of the Provisional Land Use Committee on January 1, 1980, and was given ministerial responsibility for Manitoba Data Services on January 16, 1981. The social-democratic New Democratic Party won the 1981 election, and Orchard resigned from cabinet on November 30, 1981.

The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in 1988 under Gary Filmon, and Orchard was appointed Minister of Health on May 9 of that year (despite the fact that he attempted to remove Filmon as party leader in 1986). He held this portfolio until September 10, 1993, when he was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for the Manitoba Hydro Act. He did not seek re-election in 1995, and resigned from cabinet on March 20 of that year.

As Health Minister, Orchard banned Medicare coverage from Henry Morgentaler&#x27;s private abortion clinic. This decision provoked criticism from both sides of the abortion debate; some wanted the clinic closed entirely, while others wanted full funding.

Orchard was a rural populist, on the right-wing of the Progressive Conservative Party. In 2003, he supported cooperation between the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the Portage—Lisgar riding, before the two parties were formally merged.

<text>Edson Range is a firing range complex at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, California. It is named for Marine Major General &quot;Red Mike&quot; Edson, &quot;a World War II Medal of Honor recipient and a distinguished small arms marksman proponent.&quot; This rifle-qualification complex is home to four of the largest firing ranges on the base. The range became operational on August 21, 1964, the same day that Camp Calvin B. Matthews, in La Jolla, California, was closed and turned over to the University of California. Camp Matthews had previously been used for rifle training.

While located at Camp Pendleton, Edson Range is organized as an annex of Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and serves as the rifle qualification range where Marine recruits receive field and rifle training during boot camp. Two weeks of marksmanship training followed by one week of infantry field skills take place at Edson Range, which is known as &quot;up north&quot; by recruits and drill instructors alike (the Recruit Depot in San Diego being &quot;down south&quot;). The Crucible, a three to four day combat simulation with little food or sleep, also takes place here.

Edson Range is also home to the &quot;Swift Intruders&quot;, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Assault Craft Unit 5 who operate the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and train on the Edson Range beaches and the adjacent Pacific Ocean.
Bravo range is famous for being the range Lee Harvey Oswald shot on when he was a Marine.

==Recruit live fire training==
Marine recruits undertake two different courses of fire while learning how to use the M16 rifle. During their first week of weapons training (known as Grass Week), recruits learn in a classroom setting with instruction coming from a PMI (Primary Marksmanship Instructor). On the second week (known as Firing Week), recruits will go to one of the three KD (known distance) ranges to fire Table 1A, their first course of fire. The three live fire ranges aboard Edson Range where Table 1 is fired are the &quot;world famous&quot; Bravo Range, Charlie Range, and Delta Range. The week after qualifying on Table 1 is spent on Alpha Range where the recruits will fire Table 2, which is the introduction to the Marine Corps&#x27; Combat Marksmanship Program.

<text>XDI (eXtensible Data Interchange) is a semantic data interchange format and protocol under development by the OASIS XDI Technical Committee. The name comes from the addressable graph model XDI uses: every node in the XDI graph is its own RDF graph that is uniquely addressable.

==Background==

The main features of XDI are: the ability to link and nest RDF graphs to provide context; full addressability of all nodes in the graph at any level of context; representation of XDI operations as graph statements so authorization can be built into the graph; a standard JSON serialization format; and a simple ontology language for defining shared semantics using XDI dictionary services.

The XDI protocol is based on an exchange of XDI messages which themselves are XDI graphs. Since the semantics of each message is fully contained within the XDI graph of that message, the XDI protocol can be bound to multiple transport protocols. The XDI TC is defining bindings to HTTP and HTTPS, however it is also exploring bindings to XMPP and potentially directly to TCP/IP.

XDI also provides a standardized portable authorization format called XDI link contracts. Link contracts are XDI subgraphs that express the permissions that one XDI actor (person, organization, or thing) grants to another for access to and usage of an XDI data graph. XDI link contracts enable these permissions to be expressed in a standard machine-readable format understood by any XDI endpoint.

This approach to globally distributed data sharing models the real-world mechanisms of social contracts and legal contracts that bind civilized people and organizations in the world today. Thus XDI can be a key enabler of a distributed Social Web. It has also been cited as a mechanism to support a new legal concept, Virtual Rights , which are based on a new legal entity, the &quot;virtual identity&quot;, and a new fundamental right: &quot;to have or not to have virtual identities&quot;.

Public services based on the OASIS XDI specification are under development by an international non-profit organization, XDI.org .

Australia has been on a decline on the Press Freedom Index, in reflection of rising media censorship and intimidation of journalists in the country, including media companies maintaining close ties to political leaders, fueling doubts about editorial independence. Two giant firms dominate mass media in Australia – Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia, a subsidiary of American-based News Corp. The country was ranked 19th out of 180 countries in 2018, before subsequently dropping to 26th out of 180 countries for 2020 and 39th in 2022. 

==Television==
===Free-to-air TV===
New South Wales and Victoria were introduced to television in 1956, with the other states and territories following suit up to 1971 (the Northern Territory). Colour television was introduced in 1975.

In addition to the public broadcasters which are available to almost all of Australia&#x27;s population, there are three major commercial television networks: the Seven Network, the Nine Network and Network 10. Most of Australia&#x27;s heavily populated cities are serviced by all three networks. Some rural or regional areas may receive a more limited selection, often with some of the channels available showing programming from more than one of the major networks. An example of such a &quot;shared&quot; regional network is Imparja.

Digital free-to-air broadcasts commenced on 1 January 2001. Analogue broadcasts were originally intended to be phased out by 2008, however analogue phaseout was not achieved until 2013.

After heated debate in the early 2000s over a Bill that would have removed the foreign ownership restrictions of broadcasting TV licences, the Keating government chose to retain the foreign-ownership restrictions in its 1992 Broadcasting Act. The Howard government was set to remove this law sometime in 2007, having gained parliamentary approval to change the legislation in 2006.

In 2007, with Helen Coonan as communications minister, there were two significant changes. Foreign ownership limits were scrapped, government changed the cross-media ownership rules to allow ownership of two out of three media types.

=== Pay TV and streaming services ===
Approximately 25% of Australian households had access to pay television services by the end of 2005. The main provider is Foxtel in both metropolitan, regional and rural areas offering nearly all Australian channels via cable &amp; satellite TV in capital cities, and mostly the same channels are offered by Foxtel via satellite TV (predominantly) in regional areas with the recent merger with Austar in 2012.

In mid-2016 the number of Australians with access to some form of pay television outstripped those with without. At the end of 2019 14.5 million Australians had access to some form of Pay TV or Subscription TV, with the combined audience of these platforms equalling almost 70% of the population. Netflix remains the market leader, although Foxtel and Stan have gained continual growth since entering the market. 

There are several smaller competitors offer a subset of channels – with Fetch TV entering the market in 2010 with a subscription service over a few ADSL2+ networks, and TransACT offering TV via its own VDSL, VDSL2 and FTTP/FTTH networks in Canberra and its Neighbourhood Cable network in parts of Victoria. Other providers of Internet television in Australia offer free content or PPV, but don&#x27;t offer a subscription product. UBI World TV offers a number of ethnic satellite TV and Radio channels nationwide, and other small companies offer some channels via satellite, especially foreign services or free-to-air channels, and some channels are available over the Internet.

====Netflix====
Netflix was released in Australia and New Zealand 24 March 2015. As of February 2019, 11.2 million Australians had a Netflix subscription in their household, up 25% on a year before that.

Netflix has been criticised for not &quot;telling&quot; Australian stories by former ABC managing director Mark Scott. Research has found that Australian film and television made up less than 2% of Netflix&#x27;s Australian catalogue in 2018. In 2020, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission floated a proposal to subject Netflix to local content requirements. However, this proposal was ultimately rejected by the government.

==Radio==
Australia&#x27;s first regular radio broadcasts began on 23 November 1923 with station 2SB (later to become 2BL) in Sydney. The ABC began broadcasting in 1932. Talkback radio was first broadcast with 2UE in Sydney, just after midnight on 17 April 1967. ABC began experimenting with FM stations in the 1960s, but it wasn&#x27;t until July 1980 that the first FM station commenced full operations. Melbourne-based 3EON (now known as Triple M) was the first to air.

In 2009, there were 274 operational commercial stations (funded by advertising) and 341 community (publicly funded) radio stations.

National news radio broadcasters include the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which operates 4 national radio news networks (including ABC NewsRadio and Radio National), 53 local news stations through ABC Local Radio and several digital radio stations; and the Special Broadcasting Service which also delivers multilingual Australian-produced news content.

==Regulation==

Regulation of the media is principally assured by the federal government through its power to make laws governing telecommunications. The Australian states and territories also have important roles in this area, notably in the area of defamation law, although their laws may not conflict with a valid federal law. 

The Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority (ACMA) is the broadcasting regulator for radio and television in Australia, and also the co-regulatory Online Content Scheme. Consumers who have complaints about programs on television and radio or certain types of content on the Internet can apply to the ACMA. The Commercial Television Code of Practice is a set of regulatory guidelines, registered with the ACMA, with which commercial television broadcasters should comply. 

The Australian Press Council is the self-regulatory body of the print media. The Council deals with complaints from the public about editorial material in newspapers and magazines published in Australia, and aims to maintain the freedom of the press. 

===Media ownership===
Controls over media ownership in Australia are laid down in the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act 1992&quot;, administered by the ACMA. Even with laws in place Australia has a high concentration of media ownership compared to other western countries. Ownership of national and the newspapers of each capital city are dominated by two corporations, News Corp Australia, (which was founded in Adelaide but is now based from the United States) and Nine Entertainment – News Corp-owned titles account for nearly two-thirds (64.2 per cent) of metropolitan circulation and Nine-owned papers account for a further quarter (26.4 per cent).

The Australian Associated Press (AAP) is owned by a not-for-profit organisation. The AAP distributes the news and then sells it on to other outlets such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Although much of the everyday mainstream news is drawn from the AAP, all the privately owned media outlets still compete with each other for exclusive pop culture news.

Rural and regional media is dominated by Australian Community Media, with significant holdings in all states and territories. Rural Press received a takeover offer from Fairfax Media in late 2006, and completed the merger on 8 May 2007.

There are rules governing foreign ownership of Australian media and these rules were loosened by Helen Coonan under the Howard Government via Act No. 129 of 2006 which allowed for changes to the cross-media and foreign ownership laws with the &quot;Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006 .&quot; These changes came into effect in 2007 and are still in Force. The changes relaxed restrictions against cross-media ownership &amp; control by a single company.

According to Reporters Without Borders in 2006, Australia was in 35th position on a list of countries ranked by Press Freedom; well behind New Zealand (19th) and United Kingdom (27th) (but well ahead of the US, ranked 53rd). This ranking was primarily due to the restrictions imposed by the recent anti-terrorism laws. The problem, and the concentration of media ownership, was one of many mentioned on the television show &quot;Media Watch&quot;, broadcast on the government funded ABC. As of 2018 these rankings have changed with Australia moving up to 19th, New Zealand moving up to 8th and the United Kingdom falling to 40th.

===News Media Bargaining Code===
=== Media freedom ===
On 4 June 2019 the Australian Federal Police conducted a raid on the home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst&#x27;s home, looking for information connected to a story she had written a year earlier about new laws that would give the security forces new powers for surveillance over Australian citizens. Radio host Ben Fordham also said he was under investigation for some of his reporting.

The next day, the AFP raided the ABC over a story about alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The search warrant allowed the police to &quot;add, copy, delete or alter&quot; any files they found on the computers.

The incidents caused an outcry of condemnation, even from the Reporters Without Borders, BBC and the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

In Australia itself, newspaper outlets normally driven by partisanship and advertising exhibited a surprisingly united show of protest on 21 October as they published front pages with the appearance of documents having been blacked out by government censors. The protest demanded journalists gain access to sensitive government material. Most of the larger media outlets formed a coalition, Right To Know, to represent the protest and demand six changes in legislation. The demands are, for the ability to contest any search warrant of a journalist or news entity while the search warrant is under request, reform of whistleblower protection, new limitations on which documents may be classified as secret, changes in freedom of information, exemption from national security laws enacted over the previous seven years, and reforms of defamation laws.

<text>Richard Duane Hongisto (December 16, 1936, Bovey, Minnesota – November 4, 2004, San Francisco, California) was a businessman, politician, sheriff, and police chief of San Francisco, California, and Cleveland, Ohio.

== Early life and education ==
Of Finnish descent, Hongisto was the son of Gladys Longrie and Raymond Hongisto. In 1942, Dick moved to San Francisco with his parents and brother Don. 

&quot;Hongisto grew up in the city&#x27;s Richmond and Fillmore districts, and his parents ran a grocery store in the Sunnydale neighborhood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/HONGISTO-1936-2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick graduated from George Washington High School. He later attended San Francisco City College. While completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree at San Francisco State University, Hongisto became an officer of the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD).

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

As a police officer, Hongisto earned a reputation for activism, fighting discrimination within the police force and against police brutality. He was a co-founder of Officers for Justice, an organization of officers who were primarily racial minorities or gay.

Hongisto&#x27;s activism made him controversial among the ranks of the SFPD, but at the same time he was a popular public figure. He ran for sheriff in 1971, and was elected — an event that shocked the San Francisco political establishment. The incumbent, Matthew Carberry, had been a four-term sheriff, was well-connected politically, and had been considered a shoo-in for a return to the job.

Hongisto&#x27;s election had been orchestrated methodically by computer analyst Les Morgan, using the then-new idea of precinct analysis of voting trends. Hongisto was considered the first candidate for public office in San Francisco to be elected largely by outsiders: gay, Latino, and other minority voters who had a strong voting presence, but who had been ignored by the political establishment.

He was the first sheriff to hire gay and lesbian deputies, and later became embroiled in controversy when he deliberately delayed the eviction of residents from the International Hotel, a residential hotel in Manilatown, San Francisco, next to Chinatown, San Francisco.

 After a long period where he refused to order the eviction, which included time spent in the San Mateo County jail on contempt of court charges, Hongisto eventually carried out the mass eviction, which earned him the enmity of some of the very people he tried to protect.

=== Cleveland ===

After serving as the sheriff in San Francisco, Hongisto briefly moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1977, where he served as police chief under Mayor Dennis Kucinich. His penchant for controversy, and conflicts with Kucinich, eventually led to his being fired by the mayor on live local television. In Cleveland his firing sparked a recall drive to remove Kucinich from office.

=== New York State ===

The Governor of the State of New York then invited Hongisto to manage that state&#x27;s prison system. Hongisto accepted the challenge of reforming a system that had been plagued by riots and unrest within several of its facilities. Permanent appointment to this position required confirmation by the state senate, which was not forthcoming. Hongisto therefore returned to San Francisco to run for supervisor in 1980.

=== Return to San Francisco ===

Upon his return to San Francisco, Hongisto was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where he helped to place Proposition M, a measure which would limit construction of high rise commercial buildings, on the public ballot. The measure passed overwhelmingly, and has to this day continued to impact the development of San Francisco&#x27;s skyline.

With the endorsement of then-Mayor Art Agnos, Hongisto later ran for the office of Assessor.

In 1991, he ran for mayor but did not make the run-off, coming in fourth. After declining to endorse Agnos for re-election as mayor, in a race won by police chief Frank Jordan, Hongisto was appointed in 1992 by Jordan to be San Francisco&#x27;s police chief.

Hongisto&#x27;s tenure as police chief lasted only six weeks, and was punctuated by controversy over his handling of demonstrations and riots which occurred in the wake of the Rodney King police brutality trial in Los Angeles. Hongisto cordoned off an entire neighborhood in the Mission district on a Saturday afternoon, establishing a net that saw the arrests of all people on the street, demonstrators and ordinary citizens alike. Hongisto had rented city buses to transport the arrested citizens, and they were processed at a warehouse on San Francisco&#x27;s wharfs. Instead of merely citing and releasing those arrested, Hongisto ordered that they be arrested and processed at the Santa Rita jail in Dublin (Alameda County), rather than in San Francisco County, thus ensuring that they would not be able to avail themselves of their civil rights and return to San Francisco. This enraged progressive activists and civil libertarians as well as the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which ordered Hongisto to release the citizens he had arrested. On the following Saturday, Hongisto ordered police to disrupt another demonstration and arrested demonstrators with no order to disperse. Both incidences were later the targets of class action suits against the city of San Francisco, although the former, undertaken by the Lawyer&#x27;s Guild, would not be resolved for nearly a decade.

Soon thereafter, a gay and lesbian community newspaper, the &quot;San Francisco Bay Times&quot;, published a cover graphic of Hongisto&#x27;s head pasted on the body of a lesbian activist. The activist, dressed in a police uniform, held a giant baton with one end protruding from the groin area as if it were an erect penis. The headline screamed, &quot;Dick&#x27;s Cool New Tool: Martial Law&quot;, in reference to the police actions. What happened afterwards is subject to dispute. Hongisto claimed that he had asked members of the police union to gather copies of the paper to show members of the rank and file what he was enduring in the activist press, in reaction to their criticism of his supposedly failing to properly defend their conduct of the arrests during the King riots. Around 2,000 copies of the free papers were taken from news racks by three officers and later found stored at the Mission District police station. Hongisto was publicly accused of ordering the confiscation of the papers in attempt at censorship, a charge he continued to deny up to his death. After a hearing, the San Francisco Police Commission found him culpable, and Mayor Jordan dismissed him. One of those three officers, Gary Delagnes, later became president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association.

== Personal life ==
In 1993, Hongisto married Susan Chavez, who was 23 years his junior. On September 24, 1994, Chavez Hongisto died of an asthma attack brought on by smoking crack cocaine.

Hongisto left public life to become a full-time businessman and real estate investor, apart from an unsuccessful run for County Supervisor in 2000.

Hongisto died of a heart attack on November 4, 2004, at the age of 67, leaving behind a son and daughter. He married four times, and was living with a 31-year-old girlfriend at the time of his death.

<text>The Lokot Autonomy () or Lokot Republic (, ) was an autonomous republic in the occupied territories of the Bryansk, Oryol and Kursk Oblasts of the Soviet Union, formed by German Nazi troops, and more specifically by Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Army during World War II. 

The Wehrmacht entered the area in October 1941 and were forced out in August 1943. A local administration and police were appointed by German occupation authorities in November 1941. The autonomous republic was established in July 1942, when six districts were added to the Lokot district. The autonomy&#x27;s name was derived from the region&#x27;s administrative center, the urban-type settlement of Lokot in Oryol Oblast (now located in Bryansk Oblast). The autonomy covered the area of eight raions (the present-day Brasovsky, Dmitriyevsky, Dmitrovsky, Komarichsky, Navlinsky, Sevsky, Suzemsky and Zheleznogorsky districts) now divided between Bryansk, Oryol and Kursk Oblasts. 

The Lokot Autonomy was ruled by a Russian civil administration led by Bronislav Kaminski and Konstantin Voskoboinik. The German authorities established the Autonomy to serve as a test case for a Russian collaborating government under the SS in the proposed Reichskommissariat Moskowien.

==History==

=== Foundation ===
In October 1941, the Nazi German military advanced into the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. They reached the Lokot area near the city of Bryansk and captured it on October 6, 1941. In November 1941 Bronislav Kaminski (an engineer at a local distillery) and Konstantin Voskoboinik (a local technical school teacher) were approached by the German military administration to help them establish a civil administration and local police. Voskoboinik was designated by Germans as starosta of the &quot;Lokot volost.&quot; Kaminski became Voskoboinik&#x27;s deputy. Other deputies appointed were Stepan Mosin and Roman Ivanin (the head of the local militia), both former prisoners.

=== Militia ===

Initially, the militia headed by Voskoboinik numbered no more than 200 men. It assisted Germans in policing the area and committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population loyal to the Soviet authorities or Soviet partisans, Soviet prisoners of war (POWs), Jews and ordinary civilians. By January 1942 the militia&#x27;s personnel was increased to 400–500.

During a partisan attack headed by Alexander Saburov on January 8, 1942, Voskoboinik was fatally wounded. Kaminski took over the command and further expanded the militia.

In cooperation with German forces, the militia commenced security operations, and by the spring of 1942, the militia had 1,400 armed personnel. The number of Soviet partisans in this area was estimated at 20,000 men; they controlled almost the entire rear of the Army Group Centre&#x27;s area of operations.

In March 1942, Kaminski&#x27;s representative to the German 2nd Panzer Army in Oryol gave assurances that Kaminski&#x27;s unit was &quot;ready to fight the guerrillas actively&quot; and to carry on a propaganda campaign against &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; and Soviet partisans. Soon after that, the commander of the 2nd Army Generaloberst Rudolf Schmidt appointed Kaminski as the mayor of the Korück 532 centered in the township of Lokot. On 19 July 1942, after the Commander of the Army Group Centre, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge gave an official approval, the Lokot administration received some degree of autonomy and nominal self-rule under the supervision of Major von Veltheim and Colonel Rübsam. Kaminsky was appointed the Oberbürgermeister of the Autonomous Administration of Lokot (comprising eight raions) and the brigadier of the local militia.

From June 1942, Kaminski&#x27;s militia took part in a major anti-partisan operation code-named Operation Vogelsang, as part of General Werner von Gilsa&#x27;s Kampfgruppe (battle group) Gilsa II.

Germans did not interfere in the Lokot Autonomy&#x27;s affairs as long as their transports were kept safe, and the republic delivered the required food quotas to the Wehrmacht. Kaminski established a court, jails, and newspapers. Collective farms were abolished, and a significant degree of free enterprise was permitted. Kaminski&#x27;s speeches published in the region&#x27;s newspapers emphasized that Nazi Germany and Russia &quot;are the same.&quot;

The schools (closed after the German invasion) reopened, and a radio station and some theater groups were established in Lokot, Dmitrovsk and Sevsk Newspapers published in the Lokot Autonomy were typical of all newspapers published on Nazi-occupied Russian territories, featuring articles claiming Judeo-Bolshevik crimes along with Nazi propaganda with the usual heavy dose of antisemitism. The Jewish population in the Autonomy was murdered without German assistance: 223 Jews were shot dead in the township of Suzemka, and 39 at Navlya.

In October 1942, Kaminski renamed Lokot township as the town of Voskoboinik. Streets in other townships of the Autonomy were also renamed.

In the autumn of 1942, Kaminski ordered the compulsory draft into the militia of all non-disabled men. Its units were reinforced with the &quot;volunteers&quot; drafted from Soviet POWs at the nearest Nazi concentration camps. Due to the lack of uniforms and boots (some units were barefoot), the Germans provided Kaminski&#x27;s brigade with used uniforms: these were sufficient for only four battalions. Kaminski ordered the gathering of Soviet tanks and armored cars abandoned in 1941 due to the lack of fuel or minor mechanical failures – by November 1942, his unit had at least two BT-7 tanks and one 76 mm artillery gun.

By late 1942, the militia of the Lokot Autonomy had expanded to the size of a 14-battalion brigade with close to 8,000 men under arms called the Russian National Liberation Army (RONA). From November 19, 1942, to December 1942, Lokot was inspected by Alfred Rosenberg.

In January 1943, the brigade numbered 9,828 people; the armored unit of brigade had in total 15 vehicles:

* two heavy KV-2, 
* four medium T-34, 
* four BT-7,
* two SU-76 self-propelled guns.
* three armored cars (BA-10, two BA-20).

In the spring of 1943, the brigade&#x27;s structure was reorganized. There were five regiments created with three battalions in each, an anti-aircraft battalion (three AA guns and four heavy machine guns) and an armored unit. A separate &quot;guard&quot; battalion was created, with brigade strength estimated to be 12,000 men in total.

Before Operation Citadel, the massive offensive to destroy the Kursk salient, in May–June 1943, the brigade took part in Operation Zigeunerbaron (&quot;Gypsy Baron&quot;) together with other German units.

Similar operations followed this operation, such as &quot;Freischütz&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, in which the brigade and other units under German command were involved in action against partisans and also took part in reprisal operations against the civilian population.

In the summer of 1943, the brigade began to suffer significant desertions, due in part to the recent Soviet victories and the partisans&#x27; efforts to &quot;turn&quot; as many of Kaminski&#x27;s troops as possible. As a part of these efforts, several attempts on Kaminski&#x27;s life were carried out. Each time, Kaminski narrowly avoided death and punished the conspirators with execution. Several German officers passing through Lokot reported seeing bodies hanging from gallows outside Kaminski&#x27;s headquarters. Fearing a breakdown in command, a German liaison staff was attached to Kaminski&#x27;s HQ to restructure the brigade and return stability to the unit.

After the German failure of Citadel, the Soviet counteroffensives forced the brigade, along with their families, to flee with the retreating Germans. On the 29th of July, 1943, Kaminski issued an order to evacuate the RONA brigade and Lokot authorities&#x27; property and families. Germans transferred up to 30 thousand persons (10-11,000 of them were brigade members) to the Lepel area of Vitebsk in Belarus by the end of August 1943.

By September 1943, the force had 10,000 men, divided into:

* 5 infantry regiments, each of 3 battalions,
* one artillery battalion (36 field guns),
* and an armour unit of 24 captured Soviet tanks and armoured vehicles,
* in addition to engineer, signal, and medical units.

According to possibly unreliable post-war Soviet estimates, up to 10,000 civilians were killed by forces loyal to the Lokot Autonomy.

==Armed forces==
The republic had its armed forces: the Russian National Liberation Army, RONA (not to be confused with the Russian Liberation Army, ROA).

==&quot;Lepel Republic&quot;==
From the end of August 1943, Kaminski tried to set up a new &quot;Lepel Republic&quot; in the Lepel area, which met with strong opposition from the local population. Partisans overran this area, and the brigade was involved in heavy combat for the rest of the year.

During the retreat, desertions from the brigade increased significantly, and the entire formation seemed close to disintegration. When the commander of the 2nd Regiment, Major Tarasov, decided to join the partisans with all of his regiment (he was offered amnesty if his entire regiment joined the partisans), Kaminski flew to his headquarters and, according to one account, strangled him and eight others in front of his men. Despite this, up to 200 people deserted within two days.

By the beginning of October 1943, the brigade lost 2/3 of its previous personnel number.

On January 27, 1944, Heinrich Himmler decorated Kaminski with the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Iron Cross 1st Class on the same day.

On February 15, 1944, Kaminski issued an order to relocate the brigade and Lokot administration further west to the Dyatlovo area in West Belarus.

==War crimes==
The auxiliary police completely massacred the Jewish population of the area. The chief of the Suzemka area police Prudnikov took part in the massacres. There were 223 Jews shot in Suzemka, and 39 in Navlya.

==After the war==

After the war, former members RONA and supporters of the Lokot Autonomy formed anti-communist guerrilla movement, that slowly degenerated into organized crime groups and was suppressed in 1951.

Some former RONA and Lokot personnel were repatriated by the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. At the end of 1946, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced Yury Frolov, Stepan Mosin, and several others to death. In the 1950s and 1960s, several other former officials of the Autonomy were apprehended by the KGB; some of them were also sentenced to death, most notably the Lokot Autonomy&#x27;s executioner Antonina Makarova-Ginzburg, found in 1978 and executed in 1979.

==Cultural references==
Anatoli Ivanov portrayed the Lokot Republic in his novel &quot;Eternal Call&quot; () and the corresponding TV sequel, which was popular in the Soviet Union.

Zotinca began his career with FC Inter Sibiu, where he played from 1995 to 1998. In 1998, he moved to Steaua București, where he would play from 1998 to 2000, and with whom he would appear in the UEFA Cup.

In 2000, Zotinca won a United States Green Card in an immigration lottery, and left Romania for America. He played for four years for the Kansas City Comets of the MISL, being named to the All-Rookie team in 2000–01, and the All-Star team in 2002–03. Near the beginning of the 2003 MLS season, Zotinca was signed by the Wizards. He did well in his first year, starting 14 games and playing 1239 minutes in a variety of positions for the Wizards. In 2004, Zotinca firmly established himself at the right back position, and played most of the team&#x27;s minutes there, appearing in 25 games and playing 1779 minutes. He played a similarly important role during the next two seasons, but failed to sign a new contract with the team for the 2007 season and was traded to Chivas USA. Zotinca started 20 games for the club during 2007, but played a diminished role in the next season, starting only 4 games, and was waived by Chivas USA on 28 November 2008.

After a two-year layoff from professional football, Zotincă was re-signed by Chivas USA on 4 June 2010 to strengthen their defensive unit.

After the 2010 MLS season Chivas USA declined Zotincă&#x27;s contract option and Zotincă elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Zotincă became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.

== Coaching career ==
After the end of his career was part of the Chivas USA Youth team coaching staff. Since 14 December 2011 worked as Head coach by United Futebol Club in San Juan Capistrano.

<text>Soap Opera Magazine was a weekly periodical devoted to interviews and recaps of American soap opera and was run for many years by American Media until the company, which had lost money for years, decided to cease publication of the magazine, focusing instead on their tabloid endeavors. It has since gone through a new digital transformation under new ownership.

The final issue was published on February 16, 1999. At that time, all customers who had existing &quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot; subscriptions began receiving &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; instead.

<doc id="1133911" wikidata="Q831304" url="?curid=1133911" title="Condorcet winner criterion">
<text>A Condorcet winner (, ) is a candidate who would receive the support of more than half of the electorate in a one-on-one race against any one of their opponents. Voting systems where a majority winner will always win are said to satisfy the Condorcet winner criterion. The Condorcet winner criterion extends the principle of majority rule to elections with multiple candidates.

Named after Nicolas de Condorcet, it is also called a majority winner, a majority-preferred candidate, a beats-all winner, or tournament winner (by analogy with round-robin tournaments). A Condorcet winner may not necessarily always exist in a given electorate: it is possible to have a rock, paper, scissors-style cycle, when multiple candidates defeat each other (Rock &lt; Paper &lt; Scissors &lt; Rock). This is called Condorcet&#x27;s voting paradox, and is analogous to the counterintuitive intransitive dice phenomenon known in probability. However, the Smith set, a generalization of the Condorcet criteria that is the smallest set of candidates that are pairwise unbeaten by every candidate outside of it, will always exist.

If voters are arranged on a sole 1-dimensional axis, such as the left-right political spectrum for a common example, and always prefer candidates who are more similar to themselves, a majority-rule winner always exists and is the candidate whose ideology is most representative of the electorate, a result known as the median voter theorem. However, in real-life political electorates are inherently multidimensional, and the use of a one- or even two-dimensional model of such electorates would be inaccurate. Previous research has found cycles to be somewhat rare in real elections, with estimates of their prevalence ranging from 1-10% of races. 

Systems that guarantee the election of a Condorcet winners (when one exists) include Ranked Pairs, Schulze&#x27;s method, and the Tideman alternative method. Methods that do &quot;not&quot; guarantee that the Cordorcet winner will be elected, even when one does exist, include instant-runoff voting (often called ranked-choice in the United States), First-past-the-post voting, and the two-round system. Most rated systems, like score voting and highest median, fail the majority winner criterion.

== History ==
Condorcet methods were first studied in detail by the Spanish philosopher and theologian Ramon Llull in the 13th century, during his investigations into church governance. Because his manuscript &quot;Ars Electionis&quot; was lost soon after his death, his ideas were overlooked for the next 500 years.

The first revolution in voting theory coincided with the rediscovery of these ideas during the Age of Enlightenment by Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, a mathematician and political philosopher.

== Example ==
Suppose the government comes across a windfall source of funds. There are three options for what to do with the money. The government can spend it, use it to cut taxes, or use it to pay off the debt. The government holds a vote where it asks citizens which of two options they would prefer, and tabulates the results as follows:

In this case, the option of paying off the debt is the beats-all winner, because repaying debt is more popular than the other two options. But, it is worth noting that such a winner will not always exist. In this case, tournament solutions search for the candidate who is closest to being an undefeated champion.

Majority-rule winners can be determined from rankings by counting the number of voters who rated each candidate higher than another.

== Desirable properties ==
The Condorcet criterion is related to several other voting system criteria.
=== Stability (no-weak-spoilers) ===
Condorcet methods are highly resistant to spoiler effects. Intuitively, this is because the only way to dislodge a Condorcet winner is by beating them, implying spoilers can exist only if there is no majority-rule winner.

=== Participation ===
One disadvantage of majority-rule methods is they can all theoretically fail the participation criterion in constructed examples. However, studies suggest this is empirically rare for modern Condorcet methods, like ranked pairs. One study surveying 306 publicly-available election datasets found no examples of participation failures for methods in the ranked pairs-minimax family.

=== Majoritarian criteria ===
The Condorcet criterion implies the majority criterion since a candidate ranked first by a majority is clearly ranked above every other candidate by a majority.

When a Condorcet winner exists, this candidate is also part of the smallest mutual majority set, so any Condorcet method passes the mutual majority criterion and Condorcet loser in elections where a Condorcet winner exist. However, this need not hold in full generality: for instance, the minimax Condorcet method fails the Condorcet loser and mutual majority criteria.

=== Stronger criteria ===
The Smith criterion guarantees an even stronger kind of majority rule. It says that if there is no majority-rule winner, the winner must be in the top cycle, which includes all the candidates who can beat every other candidate, either directly &quot;or&quot; indirectly. Most, but not all, Condorcet systems satisfy the top-cycle criterion.

== By method ==

=== List ===
==== Pass ====
Most sensible tournament solutions satisfy the Condorcet criterion. Other methods satisfying the criterion include:

* Black
* Kemeny-Young
* Dodgson&#x27;s method
* Minimax
* Baldwin&#x27;s method
* Ranked pairs
* Schulze
* Total Vote Runoff
* Tideman&#x27;s alternative method

See for more.

==== Fail ====
The following voting systems do not satisfy the Condorcet criterion:

* Plurality voting
* Instant-runoff voting
* Borda count
* Approval Voting
* Coombs&#x27; rule
* Bucklin voting (and the closely related median voting)
* Score Voting

=== Examples of Failures ===

==== Plurality voting ====
With plurality voting, the full set of voter preferences is not recorded on the ballot and so cannot be deduced therefrom (e.g. following a real election). Plurality fails the Condorcet criterion because of vote-splitting effects. 

Consider an election in which 30% of the voters prefer candidate A to candidate B to candidate C and vote for A, 30% of the voters prefer C to A to B and vote for C, and 40% of the voters prefer B to A to C and vote for B. Candidate B would win (with 40% of the vote) even though A would be the Condorcet winner, beating B 60% to 40%, and C 70% to 30%.

A real-life example may be the 2000 election in Florida, where most voters preferred Al Gore to George Bush, but Bush won as a result of spoiler candidate Ralph Nader.
==== Instant-runoff voting ====
In instant-runoff voting (IRV) voters rank candidates from first to last. The last-place candidate (the one with the fewest first-place votes) is eliminated; the votes are then reassigned to the non-eliminated candidate the voter would have chosen had the candidate not been present.

Instant-runoff does not comply with the Condorcet criterion, i.e. it is possible for it to elect a candidate that could lose in a head to head contest against another candidate in the election. For example, the following vote count of preferences with three candidates {A, B, C}:

* A &gt; B &gt; C: 35
* C &gt; B &gt; A: 34
* B &gt; C &gt; A: 31

In this case, B is preferred to A by 65 votes to 35, and B is preferred to C by 66 to 34, so B is preferred to both A and C. B must then win according to the Condorcet criterion. Under IRV, B is ranked first by the fewest voters and is eliminated, and then C wins with the transferred votes from B.

Note that 65 voters, a majority, prefer either candidate B or C over A; since IRV passes the mutual majority criterion, it guarantees one of B and C must win. If candidate A, an irrelevant alternative under IRV, was not running, a majority of voters would consider B their 1st choice, and IRV&#x27;s mutual majority compliance would thus ensure B wins.

One real-life example of instant runoff failing the Condorcet criteria was the 2009 mayoral election of Burlington, Vermont.

==== Borda count ====

Borda count is a voting system in which voters rank the candidates in an order of preference. Points are given for the position of a candidate in a voter&#x27;s rank order. The candidate with the most points wins.

The Borda count does not comply with the Condorcet criterion in the following case. Consider an election consisting of five voters and three alternatives (candidates A, B, and C), with the following votes:

* A &gt; B &gt; C: 3
* B &gt; C &gt; A: 2

In this election, the Borda count awards 2 points for 1st choice, 1 point for second and 0 points for third. Thus, the total points received by each alternative is as follows:

* A: (3 * 2) + (0 * 1) + (2 * 0) = 6 + 0 + 0 = 6
* B: (2 * 2) + (3 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 4 + 3 + 0 = 7
* C: (0 * 3) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 0) = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2

With 7 points, B is the Borda count winner; however, the fact that A is preferred by three of the five voters to all other alternatives makes it a beats-all champion, and the required winner to satisfy the Condorcet criterion.

==== Bucklin/Median ====

Highest medians is a system in which the voter gives all candidates a rating out of a predetermined set (e.g. {&quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;poor&quot;}). The winner of the election would be the candidate with the best median rating. Consider an election with three candidates A, B, C.

* 35 voters rate candidate A &quot;excellent&quot;, B &quot;fair&quot;, and C &quot;poor&quot;,
* 34 voters rate candidate C &quot;excellent&quot;, B &quot;fair&quot;, and A &quot;poor&quot;, and
* 31 voters rate candidate B &quot;excellent&quot;, C &quot;good&quot;, and A &quot;poor&quot;.

B is preferred to A by 65 votes to 35, and B is preferred to C by 66 to 34. Hence, B is the beats-all champion. But B only gets the median rating &quot;fair&quot;, while C has the median rating &quot;good&quot;; as a result, C is chosen as the winner by highest medians.

==== Approval voting ====
Main article: Approval voting

Approval voting is a system in which the voter can approve of (or vote for) any number of candidates on a ballot. Approval voting fails the Condorcet criterion

Consider an election in which 70% of the voters prefer candidate A to candidate B to candidate C, while 30% of the voters prefer C to B to A. If every voter votes for their top two favorites, Candidate B would win (with 100% approval) even though A would be the Condorcet winner.

==== Score voting ====

Score voting is a system in which the voter gives all candidates a score on a predetermined scale (e.g. from 0 to 5). The winner of the election is the candidate with the highest total score. Score voting fails the Condorcet criterion. For example:

Here, C is declared winner, even though a majority of voters would prefer B; this is because the supporters of C are much more enthusiastic about their favorite candidate than the supporters of B. The same example also shows that adding a runoff does not always cause score to comply with the criterion (as the Condorcet winner B is not in the top-two according to score).

<doc id="1133914" wikidata="Q17180" url="?curid=1133914" title="Kenwood Corporation">
<text>is a Japanese brand for consumer electronics. Since October 2008, Kenwood has been owned by JVCKenwood as a result of a merger between Kenwood Corporation and JVC. Kenwood has manufactured electronic equipment such as AM/FM stereo receivers, cassette tape decks/recorders, amateur radio (ham radio) equipment, radios, televisions, cellular phones, speakers and other consumer electronics.

==History==
Kenwood was established in 1946 as the Kasuga Radio Co. Ltd. in Komagane, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. In 1960, the company was renamed to Trio Corporation. In 1963, the first overseas office was founded in Los Angeles County, California, United States.

In the early 1960s, Trio&#x27;s products were rebranded by the Lafayette Radio Company, which focused on citizens band radio.

A&amp;A Trading Co. imported Japanese-made electronics for RadioShack. William &quot;Bill&quot; Kasuga, a bilingual Japanese-speaking manager from A&amp;A, partnered with George Aratani and Yoichi Nakase to establish a company as the exclusive importer of Trio products.

The name Kenwood was invented by Kasuga as a combination of &quot;Ken&quot; (a name common to Japan and North America that was considered acceptable to American consumers due to the Kenmore appliance brand), and &quot;Wood&quot; (referring to the material, as well as suggesting a relation to Hollywood, California). The brand recognition of Kenwood eventually surpassed that of Trio. In 1986, Trio bought Kenwood and renamed itself to Kenwood. George Aratani was the first chairman of Kenwood USA Corporation, and was later succeeded by Kasuga. In October 2008, Kenwood merged with JVC to form a new holding company, JVCKenwood.
Kenwood introduced its Sovereign line of components in 2001. In 2007, Kenwood discontinued its line of consumer audio receivers, home theatre systems and other home electronics.

Today, Kenwood products include home audio, car audio aftermarket and OEM, in-car entertainment, amateur radio, professional two-way radio and DECT wireless intercom sectors.

==Products ==

===Speakers===
Kenwood produces a variety of audio speakers at different grades, ranging from stage sound to high fidelity. The company introduced the first car stereo speaker to utilize a honeycombed linear plane diaphragm.

===Amateur radio transceivers===

Kenwood has offered lines of HF, VHF/UHF, and portable amateur radio models, including some with built-in digital data modes (Automatic Packet Reporting System, built on AX.25 packet radio) and modems needed to send and receive these protocols.

===KA Series hi-fi systems===
Kenwood launched a series of &quot;Integrated Amplifier&quot; stereo power amplifiers in 1977 and continued their production through the mid-1980s. The design for most of these products featured a true dual-mono path for stereo output (where no electrical components are shared between left- and right-channel amplification). Front plates were typically made in brushed aluminium with aluminium knobs and switches, glass covers, and in some cases analog VU meters.

Amplifiers in this series included (in no particular order):
* KA-1000 (11/1980)
* TRIO Supreme 1
* KA-2000 
* KA-2002 (09/1970)
* KA-2200 (10/1982)
* KA-3100
* KA-6100 (1977)
* KA-7002 (1971)
* KA-7100 (10/1976)
* KA-7300 (10/1975)
* KA-8100 / KA-8150 (06/1977)
* KA-8300 (with analog meters vs. 8100)
* KA-9100
* KA-900 (11/1980)
* KA-907 / KA-9900 (10/1978)
* KA-9100 / KA-9150 (1977)
* KA-6100 / (1978/9)

===NV-Series Compact HiFi Systems===
These were a series of compact high fidelity stereo systems launched in 2000, featuring a new design aesthetic.

;NV-301/701
The NV-301 and NV-701 both featured a three-layered half-mirrored design. The NV-301 was the basic model with two speakers and a line input (marked for MiniDisc and DVD players) while the NV-701 was a 5.1 Dolby surround sound model with A/V inputs. Both models included a three-disc carousel, a cassette player with Dolby B noise reduction, a display, intelligent features, and the ability to save up to 40 radio stations, and used microcomputers to reduce the size of the unit.

===Communications equipment===

Kenwood has produced two-way radios for a variety of communications standards, including wireless DECT intercom systems, the radio frequency PMR446 and its digital counterpart dPMR446, dPMR, the Project 25 standards suite, DMR and NXDN. Their communications product range includes hand-portable and mobile terminals (including Intrinsically Safe, ATEX- and IECEx-certified hand-portable radios), repeaters, infrastructure and application solutions.

<text>The following is a partial list of radio stations in Palau.

According to &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, as of 2019 there are six radio stations in Palau: 1 A.M. &amp; 5 F.M. Two of these stations (T8AA FM and AM) are operated by the Palau National Communications Corporation for use by the Government of Palau.
== History ==
Palau previously hosted two shortwave radio stations operated by World Harvest Radio International. These stations, known as Angel-3 (T8WH) and Angel-4 (T8BZ) transmitted Christian religious programming to areas in the Western Pacific, primarily China. These stations ceased operation on 27 October 2019.

ABC Radio Australia commenced operations in Palau in early 2024 in partnership with Eco Paradise FM, the government-operated station.

<doc id="1133918" wikidata="Q2711685" url="?curid=1133918" title="Snub square antiprism">
<text>In geometry, the snub square antiprism is the Johnson solid that can be constructed by snubbing the square antiprism. It is one of the elementary Johnson solids that do not arise from &quot;cut and paste&quot; manipulations of the Platonic and Archimedean solids, although it is a relative of the icosahedron that has fourfold symmetry instead of threefold.

== Construction and properties ==
The snub is the process of constructing polyhedra by cutting loose the edge&#x27;s faces, twisting them, and then attaching equilateral triangles to their edges. As the name suggested, the snub square antiprism is constructed by snubbing the square antiprism, and this construction results in 24 equilateral triangles and 2 squares as its faces. The Johnson solids are the convex polyhedra whose faces are regular, and the snub square antiprism is one of them, enumerated as formula_1, the 85th Johnson solid. 

Let formula_2 be the positive root of the cubic polynomial
formula_3
Furthermore, let formula_4 be defined by
formula_5
Then, Cartesian coordinates of a snub square antiprism with edge length 2 are given by the union of the orbits of the points
formula_6
under the action of the group generated by a rotation around the axis by 90° and by a rotation by 180° around a straight line perpendicular to the axis and making an angle of 22.5° with the axis. It has the three-dimensional symmetry of dihedral group formula_7 of order 16.

The surface area and volume of a snub square antiprism with edge length formula_8 can be calculated as:
formula_9

<text>The BRDM-2 (&quot;Boyevaya Razvedyvatelnaya Dozornaya Mashina&quot;, Боевая Разведывательная Дозорная Машина, literally &quot;Combat Reconnaissance/Patrol Vehicle&quot;) is an amphibious armoured scout car designed and developed in the Soviet Union. It was also known under the designations BTR-40PB, BTR-40P-2 and GAZ 41-08. This vehicle, like many other Soviet designs, has been exported extensively and is in use in at least 38 countries. It was intended to replace the older BRDM-1, and has improved amphibious capabilities and better armament compared to its predecessor. 

==History==
After a few years of use by the Soviet Army, the limitations and drawbacks of the BRDM-1 became obvious. The vehicle had no turret and to operate the armament the gunner had to open a hatch and expose himself to enemy fire. The vehicle was not fitted with an NBC protection system, and had no night vision equipment by default. The vehicle also lacked any kind of special sights, which undermined its function as a reconnaissance vehicle. These drawbacks encouraged the design team to create a new vehicle which would suit the modern battlefield.

==Construction==

The BRDM-2 has a crew of four: a driver, a co-driver, a commander, and a gunner. It has two pairs of chain-driven belly wheels lowered by the driver, which allow trench crossing just like its predecessor, and a centralized tire pressure regulation system, which can be used to adjust the tire pressure of all four tires or individual tires while the vehicle is in motion to suit to the ground conditions.

Externally, it differs from the BRDM-1 by having a larger, box-like hull. It retains the boat-like bow of the BRDM-1, alongside its chassis, which in turn is derived from the BTR-40, being based on the chassis of the GAZ-63 from the 1940s and 1960s. However, the crew compartment is now further forward and the new GAZ-41 gasoline V8 engine (which is derived from the one used in the GAZ-13 Chaika limousine) is in the rear. Thanks to this, the engine is much better protected from enemy fire. The engine compartment is also separated from the crew compartment by an armoured barrier.

The driver&#x27;s and commander&#x27;s stations are in the front of the vehicle, with the driver positioned on the left and commander on the right. Both of them sit behind a bulletproof windscreen, which provides them with their primary view of the battlefield. When in combat, the windscreen can be additionally protected by twin armoured shutters. When the shutters are in their opened position, they protect the driver and commander from being blinded by the sunlight and ensure that the windscreen won&#x27;t be blurred by rain or snow. The commander and driver have periscopes allowing both of them a more detailed view of the surrounding terrain. The commander has six TNP-A periscopes (five in the front and one on the side of the vehicle), a TPKU-2B day sight and a TKN-1 night sight (night-vision device). The driver has four TNP-A periscopes (all in the front), one of which can be replaced by a TWN-2B night-vision device. The gunner is in the turret during combat, but when traveling he is seated inside the hull.

The engine is larger than the BRDM&#x27;s (it is a 140 hp V-8 instead of a 90 hp 6-cylinder). The BRDM-2 has an IR spotlight and four IR driving lights, as well as an over pressure collective NBC filter system. The IR spotlight is located on top of the commander&#x27;s periscope. The vehicle also has an R-123 radio and an antenna on the right side of the hull next to the commander&#x27;s hatch, for communication. There&#x27;s also a winch mounted internally at the front hull that has a 30 m cable and a 4 tonne capacity. The winch is intended to be used, among others, for self-recovery when stuck in difficult terrain. A spare tire can be mounted on top of the turret. This was most often practiced by Polish crews.

Like its predecessor, the BRDM-2 is amphibious. The GAZ-41 gasoline V-8 engine supplies power to the circular water-jet, equipped with a four-bladed propeller at the rear of the vehicle, which is covered with an armoured shutter while on land. This shutter is opened at the same time as the trim board by hydraulics, which must be done before entering water. The water-jet allows amphibious travel with a speed of 10 km/h for 17 to 19 hours. A trim board, which is stowed under the nose of the hull when traveling, is erected at the front of the hull before entering the water to improve the vehicle&#x27;s stability and displacement in the water and to prevent the water from flooding the bow of the BRDM-2. While in its traveling position, it serves as additional armour.

===Armament===

The armament is the same as the BTR-60PB armoured personnel carrier; a 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun with a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine gun as a secondary weapon, both in a small conical BPU-1 turret mounted on the hull in a central position above the belly wheels.

The 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun has a practical rate of fire of 150 rounds per minute and a cyclic rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute. It has an effective range during daylight operations of 2,000 m. It can penetrate 20 mm of armour at a range of 1,000 m and 30 mm of armour at a range of 500 m. It can also fire at air targets, in which case the tactical range is 1,400 m. It uses the 14.5 mm API-T, 14.5 mm I-T, 14.5 mm HE-T, 14.5 mm and MDZ type ammunition.

The 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun has an effective range during day time operations of 1,000 m while the vehicle is stationary and from 400 m to 500 m while the vehicle is on the move. It is fired in 2 to 10 round bursts and has a practical rate of fire of 250 rounds per minute and a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. During daylight operations, the gunner uses the PP-61AM sight, which has a field of view of 23 degrees and x2.6 magnification.

The BPU-1 turret is unusual because it has no top hatch opening. Contrary to the popular belief, the BPU-1 turret was originally designed for the BRDM-2. The turret was later used in the Soviet BTR-60PB, the Polish SKOT-2A and the Czechoslovak OT-64A. The turret allows the armament to be elevated between −5 and +30 degrees. On the left side of the turret, there is an air inlet on the hull top. There are also two air-inlet louvers in the forward part of the engine compartment&#x27;s roof and four smaller air-inlet louvers to the rear. Both sides have centrally placed vision blocks.

The vehicle armor, which is composed of welded steel, is sufficient against small arms fire and small shell fragments; but not enough for protection against big artillery fragments or .50-calibre machine gun fire, which can penetrate the BRDM-2&#x27;s maximum armor of 14 mm. The BRDM-2&#x27;s tires are not protected by armour and are particularly vulnerable to puncture from fire of all kinds.

There are three different production lots, which have different cooling vents on the engine deck. The late production version has mushroom-type vents. It also has slightly modified turret and can elevate its armament to +60 degrees. Final production BRDM-2s have additional turret periscopes and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus.

===Flaws===

BRDM-2 has flaws that are also apparent in other Soviet vehicles. These include the poor ergonomic design, low level of crew protection and high fuel consumption. The ergonomics was addressed in the Polish BRDM-2M-96 modernization and its successors, the BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal&quot;, BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal Plus&quot;, BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot;, BRDM-2M-97C &quot;Żbik-P&quot; and BRDM-2M-98 &quot;Żbik-A&quot;, which all had the belly wheels removed, thus providing more space for the crew or space for two soldiers. This was also carried out in Morozov&#x27;s BRDM-2SMD.

The BRDM-2 has a unique flaw. Because the only way in and out of the vehicle is via the front hatches, leaving the vehicle while in combat is almost impossible, as the exiting crew members would instantly enter the line of fire of both the enemy and their own vehicle, as hatches are positioned directly in front of the turret. This shortcoming was addressed in the Polish BRDM-2M-96 modernization and its successors, the BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal&quot;, BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal Plus&quot;, BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot;, BRDM-2M-97C &quot;Żbik-P&quot; and BRDM-2M-98 &quot;Żbik-A&quot;, all of which have side hatches. This was also done in the Czech LOT-B and OKV-P as well as the Ukrainian BRDM-2SMD. The Polish BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot;, BRDM-2M-97C &quot;Żbik-P&quot; and BRDM-2M-98 &quot;Żbik-A&quot; also have a hatch on the top of the turret, giving the crew another way out.

The BRDM-2&#x27;s predecessor, BRDM-1, did not have that issue as the BRDM-1 obr. 1957 had no roof and later models had a rear hatch that allowed the crew to exit the vehicle from behind. The fact that the BRDM-2 is missing such a hatch is a consequence of putting the engine in the rear, unlike in BRDM-1 where the engine is in the front.

The BRDM-2 is sometimes confused with the Hungarian D-442 FUG and D-944 PSzH amphibious scout cars, which also have rear-mounted engines. What distinguishes them from the BRDM-2 is that they have twin waterjets, whereas the BRDM-2 has a single triangular water jet.

==Service history==
===Soviet Union and Russia===
The BRDM-2 entered service with the Soviet Army in 1962. It was first publicly shown in 1966. It replaced the BRDM-1 in the Soviet and Warsaw Pact armies. Production started in 1962 and went on until 1989, with 7,200 vehicles produced (mostly for export).

The BRDM-2 became famous for being the vehicle selected to pull the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s coffin during the funeral ceremony in the Red Square.

Both Russian and Ukrainian sides used the BRDM-2 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, however by that time, very few BRDM-2 armored scout cars were spotted in service with the Russian army. These armored scout cars were generally replaced in Russian Army service by Tigr armored vehicles. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at least one captured Ukrainian BRDM-2L1 was modified with a UB-32 (rocket pod).

===Poland===
Poland bought 450 BRDM-2 armoured scout cars, 418 9P133 &quot;Malyutka&quot; and 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; tank destroyers and 32 BRDM-2RS NBC reconnaissance vehicles in 1965. Later, Poland obtained some 9P31 Surface-to-air missile launchers. In 2004, the Polish Army operated 600 BRDM-2 armoured scout cars and vehicles based on it. Currently, the Polish Army operates 200 BRDM-2&quot;s&quot;, 120 BRDM-2&quot;s&quot; modernized to BRDM-2M-96, BRDM-2M-96i, BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot; and BRDM-2M-98 &quot;Żbik-A&quot; level, 12 BRDM-2&quot;s&quot; modernized to BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal&quot; level, 100 9P133 &quot;Malyutka&quot; and 18 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; tank destroyers, 12 BRDM-2RS NBC reconnaissance vehicles, an unknown number of 9K31 Strela-1 self-propelled surface-to-air missile launchers as well as BRDM-2 R-1A and BRDM-2 R-5 command vehicles. Also one BRDM-2 was modernized to BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal Plus&quot; level. All modernizations, conversions and serious repairs of Polish BRDM-2s are done by WZM in Siemianowice Śląskie. Modernized BRDM-2 armoured scout cars will serve with the Polish Army for at least a couple of years. The 9P133 &quot;Malyutka&quot; and 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; tank destroyers, which are the basic equipment of anti-tank subunits of motorized brigades, are considered obsolete and therefore are to be replaced with ATGM launchers based on lighter vehicles, like the HMMWV, or heavier vehicles like the KTO Ryś APC or KTO Rosomak AMV.

For MSPO 2002, two Polish BRDM-2M-96i were converted into a fire unit and command vehicle with a radar of the German Rheinmetall Defence Electronics ASRAD-R missile air defense system. The system won the &quot;Defender&quot; award at that year&#x27;s event.

Polish BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal&quot; was shown at the Land Combat Expo 2004.

Two BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot; armoured scout cars took part in a military parade in Kraków on 17 May 2008. Seven BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot; armoured scout cars and six 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; tank destroyers took part in a military parade in Warsaw on the Polish Army Day, 15 August 2008.

BRDM-2, BRDM-2M-96 and BRDM-2M-96i armoured cars were used by Polish units of SFOR. Polish KFOR units also use BRDM-2M-96 armoured scout cars and BRDM-2RS NBC reconnaissance vehicles. Polish Forces in Iraq operated 12 BRDM-2M-96ik &quot;Szakal&quot; and 14 BRDM-2M-97 &quot;Żbik-B&quot;. 10 BRDM-2M-96ik were used by Polish forces of ISAF. However, these are now back in Poland, as are the 12 vehicles used in Iraq.

===Estonia===
Around 10 BRDM-2&quot;s&quot; were taken over from the Soviet Army in the early 1990s. They were mostly used during infantry training for posing as the enemy armour. Also, the Estonian police used a specially modified BRDM-2 (See the Estonia section in the Variants section). All BRDM-2&quot;s&quot; have now been withdrawn from both the military and police service.

===Ukraine===

In the Russo-Ukrainian War, the BRDM-2 and several of its variants were used by both sides. On the morning of 13 June 2014, during the First Battle of Mariupol, the Azov Battalion, Dnipro-1 Battalion and the National Guard of Ukraine retook the city and key buildings occupied by insurrectionists killing five militants and destroying an insurrectionist BRDM-2 armoured vehicle. BRDM-2s also saw action during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, primarily on the Ukrainian side. As of February 5th 2025 the open source intelligence website Oryx reports 17 BDRM-2s lost on the Russian side, and 157 for the Ukrainians.

=== Syria ===
Syria received hundreds of BRDM-2, as well as specialized variants, BRDM-2 RKh (radiological-chemical recce), 9P122, 9P148 (both anti-tank missile carriers) and 9K31 Strela-1 (SAM version). BRDM-2 and 9P122s saw widespread service against Israel during the 1973 Kippur War. Israel managed to capture enough of them to use them with its own forces. Therefore, during the 1982 Lebanon War, both Israelis and Syrians deployed BRDM-2s. The Syrian Armed Forces used the BRDM-2s for security patrols during the Lebanon Civil War, the light vehicles proving themselves very suitable for this type of operation.

At the beginning of the 2010s, the BRDM-2s, thought to be unsuitable to modern combat against Israeli forces, were retired from service. They were mostly used as riot control vehicle during the 2011 protests that led to the Syrian Civil War. During this war, the BRDM-2s or 9P148s were rarely seen in action, most of the usage being local initiatives of governmental or rebel units. A few were modified by the Islamic State into VBIEDs while the Kurdish YPG, lacking armor, used all the vehicles they could.

===Other operators===

Like all Soviet equipment, the BRDM-2 was also sold to many Arab and African countries. It is used by 38 armies. The BRDM-2 has enjoyed popularity on the export market because it was cheap, easy to operate and reliable. These factors made the BRDM-2 a more popular export reconnaissance vehicle than the BRM-1K, which was much more expensive and complicated to operate. Two BRDM-2s were sold to Grenada and were lost in the Invasion of Grenada. One was destroyed in an engagement with American M60 Pattons and the second was captured.

When the Soviet forces left Afghanistan, they abandoned many BRDM-2s. These vehicles, together with some derelict ones restored back to working state, are now used by the Afghan Taliban. The BRDM-2 also saw service with the Iraqi Army during the First Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The Soviet Union began supplying the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) with BRDM-2s shortly after Angolan independence. At least one fell victim to a rebel Panhard AML-90 crewed by South African advisers during &quot;Operation Savannah&quot;.

BRDM-2 armoured scout cars were used by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) during the Ten-Day War as well as the initial operations in Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence. The BRDM-2 was also used by the Yugoslav Army (VJ) against the KLA during the Kosovo war. BRDM-2 armoured scout cars are used by Polish, Ukrainian and Russian units of the Kosovo Force.

The Sudanese Armed Forces used several BRDM-2s during the Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile and at least 2 were captured by the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement-North in December 2012.

==Variants==
Like the BRDM, the BRDM-2 exists in several versions.

===Soviet Union===


* BRDM-2 – basic reconnaissance vehicle, distinguished by its turret, which is the same as that mounted on the BTR-60PB. The conical turret, which mounts two machine guns (14.5 mm and 7.62 mm), is unusual in that it has no top hatch opening. This model carries a crew of four: the commander, the gunner, the driver, and the co-gunner. It also has a land navigation system that gives co-ordinate readings. Late Production version had mushroom-type vents on top of engine compartment. Final production model had two additional turret periscopes, one on top of turret and the other one on the left hand side of the turret and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus. It was also known under designations BTR-40PB, BTR-40P-2 and GAZ 41-08.
** BRDM-2 without the 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun.
** BRDM-2RKh (&quot;khimicheskaya razvedivatel’naya mashina&quot;) – radiological-chemical reconnaissance vehicle with two KZO-2 rectangular dispensers for emplacing warning poles and flags around contaminated areas. The pole/flag dispensers are located on the rear corners of the vehicle&#x27;s hull. The dispensers are normally covered with canvas and when required are positioned vertically over the rear of the vehicle. The specialized equipment consist of an automatic gas detector GSA-12, a dosimeter DP-5V, a Geiger counter DP-3B, decontamination apparatus DK-4K and semi-automatic detection devices PPKhR and VPKhR. The vehicle retains the original armament. The regimental chemical defence platoon and the divisional-level chemical defence company use it, as does the divisional reconnaissance battalion. It was also known under designations BRDM-2RKhA, BTR-40P-2RKh and BTR-40PB-RKh.
*** BRDM-2RKhb – improved model that can also be used for biological reconnaissance, thanks to specialised equipment including the DP-5B Geiger counter and biological aerosol detector ASP. BRDM-2RKhb doesn&#x27;t have the firing ports. This model has twin 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine guns instead of the 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun and usually carries only one KZO-2 dispenser. It was also known under designation BRDM-2RKhB.
** BRDM-2UM (&quot;mashina upravleniya&quot;) – command vehicle without turret; however, it carries a 1 kW generator and extra radios (two R-123 and an R-107, or according to other sources one R-105M, one R-108M and one R-130M). On either side of the upper hull there is a big antenna base. Contrary to general Western belief, this is actually a very rare vehicle primarily built for export.
** 9P122 &quot;Malyutka&quot; – ATGM launcher vehicle with 6 9M14M &quot;Malyutka-M&quot; (AT-3B Sagger B) missiles on an elevatable mount with overhead cover. A total of 14 missiles are carried on board. This model is found in regimental and divisional anti-tank units of MRDs, the anti-tank regiments of combined arms armies (CAA), and in the anti-tank regiment or brigade in the artillery division of a front. It has a crew of 2.
*** 9P133 &quot;Malyutka&quot; – this is an improved model with bigger sight 9S446 instead of the original 9S414. The 9P133 can launch the more capable 9M14P &quot;Malyutka-P&quot; (AT-3C Sagger C) and 9M14P1 missiles of which it carries from 16 to 18. It uses SACLOS guidance system. The vehicle also has additional windscreen on the front between the drivers windscreen and the sight mounting.
** 9P124 – ATGM carrier vehicle with 4 radio-guided 9M17M &quot;Skorpion-M&quot; (AT-2B Swatter B) AT missiles on an elevatable mount with overhead cover. In the hull are four more missiles. It uses MCLOS guidance system. The 9P124 has a crew of 2. It was also known under designation BRDM-3.
*** 9P137 &quot;Flejta&quot; – improved model that uses the 9K8 &quot;Flejta&quot; system which allows usage of 9M19P ATGMs with SACLOS instead of MCLOS guidance. The launcher has 5 rails instead of 4.
** 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; – ATGM launcher vehicle with 5 wire-guided 9M113 &quot;Konkurs&quot; (AT-5 Spandrel). The AT-5 launcher can also fire the 9M111 &quot;Fagot&quot; (AT-4 Spigot) missile. The early production model of 9P148 could only fire 9M113 &quot;Konkurs&quot;. The crew reloads the launcher through a small hatch located behind it. The gunner controls the missiles through a sight mounted on the front right of the vehicle. The 9P148 can carry a total of 10 9M111 and 10 9M113 or 14 9M113. From 1996 some Russian 9P148 were fitted with an improved 1PN66 day/night thermal sight. In the West, it was also known under the incorrect designation BRDM-3.
*** 9P148 &quot;Konkurs&quot; with the whip antenna mount fitted to the right hand side pistol port. This is the standard production model.
** 9P31 – launcher vehicle for the 9M31 surface-to-air missile, belonging to the 9K31 Strela-1 (NATO: SA-9 &quot;Gaskin&quot;) vehicle-mounted low-altitude SAM system. The SAM launching system with quadruple canister replaces the machine gun turret on top of the vehicle, it is capable of 360 degrees traverse and limited elevation. It is lowered for travel. The vehicle doesn&#x27;t have the belly wheels. The vehicle carries 8 missiles. The crew went down to three (commander, driver and gunner).
*** 9P31 with resupply racks on the upper sides of the hull.
*** 9P31 fitted with the passive radar detection system 9S12 (FLAT BOX A) and three sensors mounted around the carrier vehicle (one next to the launcher, one on the centre of engine deck and one between windscreens), giving it 360-degree coverage. This system emits no radar energy but can detect radio waves emitted from aircraft, giving the vehicle warning about incoming aircraft and aiding in the acquisition of the target aircraft with the optical system. Typical tactics call for the launch of two missiles against each target to improve the chance of destroying it.
** ZS-82 (&quot;zvukoveshchatel&#x27;naya stantsiya&quot;) – PsyOps vehicle with a large box speaker array on top of an unarmed turret.
** TM-1 – BRDM-2 armoured scout car converted into a fire and rescue vehicle. It has visual warning device on top of the unarmed turret.
** ATM-1 &quot;Ingul&quot; – civilianised emergency transport vehicle without turret.

===Afghanistan===
* BRDM-2 converted into an improvised fire support vehicle with a complete 57 mm rocket pod and pylon from aircraft or helicopter mounted upside down on the turret roof. Improvized by Alexander Metla in 1987.

===Azerbaijan===

* Azerbaijan&#x27;s Ministry of Defense led the effort for a local variant of BRDM-2 that is named ZKDM. The layout of the vehicle was completely modified compared to the old BRDM-2, the small windows are removed and the front of the hull is fitted with new armour. The driver is seated at the front of the hull on the left with the vehicle commander to his right. The top of the hull is fitted with two roof hatches immediately behind the commander and driver. One single door is available on each side of the hull. provided by the removal of the small tires on the sides of the vehicle. The single water-jet at the rear of the hull is removed. The gasoline engine of the BRDM2 is replaced with a new diesel engine D-245.30E2 developing 150 hp to increase the maximum road speed of the vehicle to 100 km/h. The ZKDM uses technology of V-hull to increase vehicle and crew survivability by deflecting an upward directed blast from a landmine (or Improvised Explosive Device) away from the vehicle. The body of the ZKDM provides protection level B-32 against armor-piercing incendiary full metal jacket round with a hardened steel core. The ZKDM has a total weight of 7,300 kg with a crew of three, including commander, driver and gunner. The ZKDM is fitted with a new turret armed with a double-barrel, 23 mm GSh-23 cannon, one 7.62 mm PKT machine gun, one 30 mm AGS-17 grenade launchers, four 57 or 80 mm rocket launchers and two smoke grenade launchers mounted on each side of the vehicle. The turret is remotely controlled by the gunner and fitted with fire control system. The weapons have an elevation of +15º, a depression of −30º and the turret can be traversed through a full 360º. Standard equipment of the ZKDM includes BPK-2-42-day/night sight, a TV vision system with a maximum range of 1,000 m, and GPS navigation system GLONASS.

* Caiman – Upgraded BRDM-2 with no turret. Entered service in 2017. It has been exported to Ivory Coast and Angola. The vehicle is powered by a D-245.30E2 diesel engine, which produces a maximum road speed of 110 km/h, a maximum swimming speed of 8 km/h, and a road cruise range of up to 1,000 km. The ARV can carry a Kalashnikov 7.62 mm medium machinegun, NSVT Utyos 12.7 mm heavy machinegun (HMG), AGS-17 30 mm automatic grenade launcher, Adunok remote-controlled weapon station with an Utyos HMG, or a communications suite. Belarusian sources say the vehicle has been made from scratch. Its combat weight is 8.5 tons.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* BRDM-2 based tank destroyers converted into APCs.

===Cuba===
* BRDM-2 converted into a mortar platform. It was recently developed by Cuba. The turret has been removed and a M-38/43 120 mm mortar has been mounted in the modified crew compartment. Three large boxes with ammunition and equipment are located behind the roof opening. Cuban Special Forces Black Wasp (Cuban Special Forces) use the regular BRDM-2 and many of them were seen together with a Cuban made MRAP in the military parade of 2011.

===Czech Republic===
* LOT-B or BRDM-2/99 (&quot;lehký kolový obrněný transportér&quot;) – Upgraded model with Renault DCI 4C turbocharged diesel engine with power of 162 hp (121 kW), side hatches, slat-type armour over vision ports, a new NBC protection system, GPS, boxed-in exhausts, six MB smoke grenade dischargers, reworked turret with square extrusion on side, new day/night vision devices and an NSVT 12.7 mm heavy machine gun. The vehicle does not have the belly wheels. The vehicle also has a small radio antenna on the left hand side of the hull, next to the driver&#x27;s hatch. It is also known as BRDM-2NG.
** LOT-VR (&quot;velitelská verze&quot;) – Command version of the LOT-B with additional signals equipment and a generator.

* OKV-P (&quot;obrněné kolové vozidlo pro policii&quot;) – Police variant with a turret replaced by a spare wheel and a hatch next to it. It also has side hatches on each side of the hull, bigger armoured windows, police lighting array mounted on the roof, large front bumper with a registration plate, inset head, side and big turn lights, four side observation devices with slotted grills, two on the either side of the hull over the side hatches and two in the front corners of the hull with rear view mirrors in front of them, additional light on the roof, small turn lights on each side of the hull and boxed in exhaust on the left-hand side of the hull&#x27;s rear.

* BRDM-2 fitted with an IR spotlight in the front of the turret. It was used by Polish unit of SFOR.
* BRDM-2M-96 – The BRDM-2&#x27;s cramped crew compartment was a major concern for Polish crews. To address this, the WKMech design team removed the belly wheels and redesigned the vehicle&#x27;s floor, creating additional space for the crew or accommodating two additional soldiers who could dismount for reconnaissance, reducing the risk of ambushes. To improve access, side doors were added to the hull for rapid entry and exit. The BRDM-2M-96 is equipped with an upgraded PNK-72 night vision device for the driver, replacing the original TWN-2B system, which is used during nighttime operations instead of the TNP-A day sight.

=== Russia ===
*BRDM-2M – Modernised version. There are actually several upgrades with this designation. All of them have the original gasoline engine replaced by a diesel engine (GAZ-562 of 175 hp or Steyr D.245-9 of 136 hp), six MB smoke grenade dischargers on the back of the turret and some are additionally fitted with a BTR-80 style turret, new wheels, GPS etc. The version that was selected by the Russian armed forces is made by Arzamas. Designated BRDM-2A, it is in service with Russian MVD reconnaissance units. Other models have a new turret MA3 or MA4 that is also mounted on the MT-LBM series. All models have the engine exhaust on the right side of the vehicle only. Some have raised horizontal engine decks to fit the new engines.
*BRDM-2PPM – BRDM-2 converted into a fire and rescue vehicle. The armoured shutters on the front windshields and firing ports have been removed. Two windows have been added on the front corners of the hull. Another four windows have been added on each side of the hull (two per each). Two of the driving lights have been removed. The turret has been replaced with some kind of crate. There are two side hatches. There&#x27;s a small hatch in the rear, most probably used to make repairs easier.
*Umka – BRDM-2 converted for civil use. The front of the hull has been completely rebuilt as it was replaced by a tall superstructure, tall enough to have an adult man standing inside. The superstructure has two windshields in the front and a window on each of the front hull corners. There are two small windows on each side of the side door. The vehicle also has two rear view mirrors and an additional IR spotlight on the top of the superstructure.
*BRDM-2MS - Improved version of BRDM-2M. Modification for the armed forces of Myanmar, Serbia, Laos, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan. Additional wheels are dismantled. With the help of new hinged armor, the vehicle can withstand a hit of 14.5 mm KPV machine gun ammunition at distances of 300 meters, side - from 12.7 mm, rear - 7.62, Mine resistance has been strengthened. The total weight is reduced to 6900 kg. New engine with 150 hp. allows to develop maximum speed on the highway up to 100 km/h, on dirt roads - up to 50 km / h. The machine retained the ability to swim across water obstacles. Cruising range of 1,500 kilometers. The new fire control system has a stabilized three-channel panoramic commander sight that can spot the enemy up to 5 km during the day and up to 3.5 km at night. For the all-round view, six cameras are mounted, allowing round-the-clock monitoring of the terrain on four multifunctional panels.
*BRDM-2MB &quot;Bekas&quot; - In June 2020, B-ARMS company presented a new modernization of the BRDM-2 under the name BRDM-2MB Bekas. In fact, &quot;Bekas&quot; has become a modified version of the BRDM-2MS. In the new improvement, the location of additional armored screens has been changed, which have become more compact and fit more closely to the armor. In addition, a new air conditioning system was added to the vehicle, the brake and fuel systems were improved. In the cabin, sprung seats were installed, in the design of which there are shock absorbers adjustable in terms of stiffness. In addition to comfort for the crew, these seats have the ability to damp an impulse when a mine is blown up under an armored car. Changes to the internal layout of the armored car made it possible to make the fighting compartment more spacious. The gearbox has received synchronization. During the past tests of the armored car, its smooth running was noted. The amphibious capabilities of the vehicle were preserved, but significantly decreased. Now the water travel is about 2 kilometers per hour. The bulkhead between the &quot;habitable&quot; compartment and the engine compartment is sealed. This prevents the vehicle from sinking in case of unsuccessful crossing of water obstacles completely and also protects the crew in the event of an engine fire.

<text>A spiral (sometimes called a spiral loop or just loop) is a technique employed by railways to ascend steep hills.

A railway spiral rises on a steady curve until it has completed a loop, passing over itself as it gains height, allowing the railway to gain vertical elevation in a relatively short horizontal distance. It is an alternative to a zig-zag, and avoids the need for the trains to stop and reverse direction while ascending. If the train is longer than the length of each loop it may be possible to view it looping above itself.

The term &quot;loop&quot; is also often used for a railway that curves sharply and goes back on itself: if the railway crosses itself, then it forms a spiral or helix; otherwise, it forms the much more common horseshoe curve or bend.

<doc id="1133937" wikidata="Q5159037" url="?curid=1133937" title="Concrete (film)">
<text>is a 2004 independently produced Japanese film that is based on the case of the murder of Junko Furuta. The film deals as much with the social factors that produced Furuta&#x27;s four assailants as it does with Furuta&#x27;s suffering at their hands.

The film involves four boys who kidnap a girl named Misaki. The boys rape, torture, and murder her in a similar manner to the manner of the boys who killed Junko Furuta.

Many people protested the film&#x27;s release before it even premiered, and it was eventually relegated to specialty theater showings and a DVD release.

== Plot ==
Tatsuo Oosugi, a troubled working class teenager who frequently assaults his mother for divorcing his father and neglecting him, decides to join the yakuza to raise money for his future marriage with Kayoko Matsuyama after suffering burnout from his various low-paying jobs. Despite initially wanting to leave, he is given the opportunity to start a small gang called the Ryujin gang. He then recruits many of his friends to commit crimes like robbery and eventually, rape to please his seniors.

One night, they see a high school student named Misaki going home on her bike. She is knocked over by one of the boys and Tatsuo pretends to take her home. When Misaki tries to go home by herself, Tatsuo reveals his true nature and threatens to burn her house down if she speaks up. Misaki is silenced as she is raped in a hotel and brought to the house of Takao Matsuyama, their friend and Kayoko&#x27;s brother.

There, the boys insert various foreign objects into her vagina, beat her and force her to lie to her parents over the phone that she is staying at her friend&#x27;s house. Despite the horrific abuses, Misaki finds the courage to escape the house twice, with the help of Takao&#x27;s mother in the second instance, but is nonetheless caught and punished by having her leg doused in lighter fluid and burned. Tatsuo punishes Takao&#x27;s mother by beating her and threatens the other boys with murder if they express sympathy with Misaki or help her escape.

After several more instances of abuse, which leaves her incontinent and dehydrated, Misaki begs the boys for water. Tatsuo, however, taunts her and fatally injures her by beating her further and dropping a barbell on her stomach. The gang then leaves the house to relax at a sauna while the dying Misaki expresses her last wish to &quot;stay strong&quot;.

After returning from the sauna, the gang discovers that Misaki has succumbed to her injuries after she is unresponsive to Tatsuo putting a lit cigarette near her nose. He decides to cover up the murder by getting a concrete drum from his old job and burying her body in it. The drum is placed in the open fields.

Eventually, all of the boys are arrested and a detective who had previously met Tatsuo in one of his prior arrests angrily calls him a &quot;demon seed&quot; for trying to minimize his role in Misaki&#x27;s murder, by claiming that he did not intend to kill her and only killed one person. The site where Misaki&#x27;s body is found has now become a gravesite for Misaki as the audience hears her, via a voiceover, asking whether people realize &quot;how precious life is&quot;. The film ends with an illusion of a crying Tatsuo in a dark room as he fails to make a mangled bird fly from his hand.

==Cast==
* Sousuke Takaoka as - The main character
* as - The victim of Tatsuo and his gang
* as - Tatsuo&#x27;s girlfriend
* Katsuya Kobayashi as - Co-perpetrator

<text>Marchetto Cara (c. 1465 – probably 1525) was an Italian composer, lutenist and singer of the Renaissance. He was mainly active in Mantua, was well-connected with the Gonzaga and Medici families, and along with Bartolomeo Tromboncino, was well known as a composer of frottolas.

==Life==
Very little is known of his early life. By 1494 he was already employed by the Gonzaga court at Mantua, and he evidently stayed there, without interruption except for travel to sing in nearby cities, until his death. Among his duties were directing the singers both in the Cathedral of San Pietro (Mantua) and in the private estate of the Gonzaga family. As lovers and patrons of music, they employed numerous musicians, and Cara was chief among them: he wrote music for weddings, for state occasions, for intermedi, and for private entertainments, and in so doing created some of the most refined light music of the time. Along with Tromboncino, he was the most famous composer of frottole, and his compositions continued to be collected and published after his death.

Most likely he died in 1525, since his widow remarried in early 1526, and there was at the time a legal requirement for a widow to wait nine months prior to remarriage. When he died he was a wealthy man, owning two houses in the city and two large country estates: evidently the Gonzaga family paid him well.

Cara was famous not only as a composer, but as a singer and a lutenist. He sang at Mantua, for his employers, but also traveled throughout northern Italy, singing for the Medici, the Bembo family, the Bentivoglio family in Bologna, and other aristocrats in Verona, Venice, Padua, Pesaro, Cremona, as well as other cities. Baldassare Castiglione heard him sing, and wrote of him in his famous Book of the Courtier (Venice, 1528), in the same paragraph in which he praises Leonardo da Vinci:

:And no lesse doeth our Marchetto Cara move in his singinge, but with a more softe harmonye, that by a delectable waye and full of mourninge swetnesse maketh tender and perceth the mind, and sweetly imprinteth in it a passion full of great delite (translated by Sir Thomas Hoby, 1561).

==Works==
Though predominantly a composer of frottolas, a light secular form and ancestor of the madrigal, he also wrote a few sacred pieces, including a three-voice &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (one of the Marian Antiphons) as well as seven laude spirituali. His frottolas are for the most part homophonic, with short passages of imitation only at the beginnings of phrases; they are catchy, singable, and often use dance-like rhythms. The poetry for most of his 100 frottolas is anonymous, though the authors of 16 poems have been identified. Most of the poems are in the form of the &quot;barzellette&quot;, but there are also &quot;strambotti&quot;, sonnets, &quot;capitoli&quot; and &quot;ode&quot;. Almost everything is in a verse-refrain format. One of Cara&#x27;s best known frottolas, &quot;Io non compro più speranza&quot; was composed in 1504 and published in the first book of Frottolas of Petrucci .

Some of his later frottolas are more serious in character, and foreshadow the development of the madrigal, which took place in the late 1520s and 1530s, right after his death.

<text>Lafayette Radio Electronics Corporation was an American radio and electronics manufacturer and retailer from approximately 1931 to 1981, headquartered in Syosset, New York, a Long Island suburb of New York City. The company sold radio sets, Amateur radio (Ham) equipment, citizens band (CB) radios and related communications equipment, electronic components, microphones, public address systems, and tools through their company owned and branded chain of retail outlets and by mail-order.

==History==

&quot;Wholesale Radio Service&quot; was established in the early 1920s by Abraham Pletman in New York City. Radios sold by the company were trademarked “Lafayette” in July 1931. Following a Federal Trade Commission action in 1935, Wholesale Radio Service became &quot;Radio Wire Television, Inc.&quot;. A 1939 company catalog bore the names Radio Wire Television Co. Inc. and &quot;Lafayette Radio Corporation&quot;. In 1948, the company issued a catalog under the name “Lafayette-Concord” and called itself the “world’s largest radio supply organization”. In 1952, a catalog was issued using only the Lafayette name.

Lafayette Radio Electronics (LRE) soon became a thriving mail-order catalog business; the electronic components it sold were useful to amateur radio operators and electronic hobbyists in areas where such components were unavailable in local retail outlets. Lafayette&#x27;s main competitors were Radio Shack, Allied Radio, Heathkit, and &quot;mom and pop&quot; (independent) radio dealers throughout the United States. Early Lafayette Radio stores were located in Jamaica, N.Y. and Manhattan in the mid-1950s. The electronics kits were produced in the Jamaica facility.

Lafayette advertised heavily in major U.S. consumer electronics magazines of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly &quot;Audio, High Fidelity, Popular Electronics, Popular Mechanics,&quot; and &quot;Stereo Review&quot;. The company offered a free 400-page catalog filled with descriptions of vast quantities of electronic gear, including microphones, speakers, tape recorders, and other components.

In 1981, Lafayette Radio entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sold its New York area stores to Circuit City.

==Retail stores==
Until the 1960s, many independent retailers in some markets became Lafayette Radio &quot;Associate Stores&quot;, which were displaced when the company expanded. These stores were supported from headquarters at 111 Jericho Turnpike in Syosset, NY and a warehouse in Hauppauge, NY. A limited selection of product was stocked, with full access to a catalog with a wide variety of parts, tubes, cameras, musical instruments, kits, gadgets and branded gear that could be ordered and delivered through the local store. The company made major investments in what were called &quot;sound rooms&quot; to demonstrate hi-fi equipment, using custom switch panels and acoustic treatments in an attempt to duplicate a home listening environment and offer fair comparison with an assortment of branded hi-fi gear.

Managers were rewarded for maximizing gross profit margins and inventory &quot;turns&quot;, which led to frequent out-of-stock situations, often remedied by frequent cross-town inter-store transfers. Each store had a repair shop on site with a part-time technician. Some locations had multiple full-time service technicians. Others had service departments that operated independently of the store but under the same ownership. Stores ranged in size from 2,000 to .

By the late 1970s, Lafayette expanded to major markets across the country, struggling to compete with Radio Shack, which was purchased by Tandy Leather Co. in 1963. Lafayette ran into major financial difficulty when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) expanded a new citizens band radio (&quot;CB&quot;) spectrum to 40 channels in 1977. Lafayette&#x27;s buyers had firm commitments to accept delivery of thousands of older design units capable of only 23 channels, and were not able to liquidate the inventory without taking a serious loss. Eventually, all of the old CB radios were sold for under $40.

With fewer than 100 stores, far fewer than the aggressively expanding Radio Shack&#x27;s thousands of local outlets, Lafayette Radio remained more of a dedicated enthusiasts&#x27; store than a mass marketer. The company was also hurt by the advent of electronics retailers relying on aggressive marketing techniques and competitive pricing in the late 1970s. Many experienced managers departed. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1981 and most Lafayette stores in the state of New York closed by the end of the year. Approximately two thirds of company-owned stores were closed immediately. According to one employee, they were &quot;given 48 hours to tear the entire store down, get everything boxed that had a valid and current stock number, and get it on a truck to take it back to Syosset (Lafayette’s Long Island warehouse). Anything that wasn’t on the official inventory sheets was to be discarded&quot;.

In 1981, Lafayette Radio entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Several Lafayette stores were purchased by Circuit City of Richmond, Virginia. Of the 150 stores that Lafayette had once owned, eight stores remained when Circuit City took over. In order to keep the Lafayette name, which was popular in New York, Circuit City changed the store names to &quot;Lafayette-Circuit City&quot;. However, these store locations were much smaller than a standard Circuit City, and did not carry major appliances, which Circuit City carried at the time. The stores were eventually closed as Circuit City left the New York Market (only to return later). The Syosset repair center was kept open a year after the last store closing to handle warranty coverage. Lafayette-Circuit City used the phrase &quot;no haggling&quot; in its ad campaign, which featured celebrities such as Don King, in trying to demonstrate that the lowest price was always posted, unlike many competitors where you would have to bargain with the sales person for a lower price. This approach, however, did not work, and Lafayette-Circuit City fell due to competition from other New York area electronic retailers such as Newmark and Lewis, Trader Horn, The Wiz, Crazy Eddie, and PC Richard.

As of 2003, the Lafayette brand name was re-launched at the CES show that year. The company&#x27;s products are offered only through special dealers and limited retail stores.

==Products==
Lafayette&#x27;s products ranged from individual resistors, capacitors, and components to stereos and two-way radios for amateur radio, CBers, and shortwave listeners. Many were dedicated types with special functions, such as VHF receivers for police and fire channels built into a CB radio. The company&#x27;s best selling products were often shortwave receivers, parts, and portable radios. In the 1960s, many Lafayette brand radios were rebranded Trio-Kenwood sets. A significant share of 1960s and 1970s vintage Lafayette hi-fi gear was manufactured by a Japanese subcontractor named &quot;Planet Research&quot;. &quot;Criterion&quot; brand speakers were built by several offshore and some domestic assemblers. Science kits were popular, and Lafayette offered the &quot;Novatron&quot;, a &quot;Miniature Atom Smasher&quot; (van de Graaff generator), Model F-371.

While the catalog heavily promoted the company&#x27;s own branded products, Lafayette also carried models from many other hi-fi manufacturers of the era, including Marantz, Fisher, Pioneer, Sansui, AR, Dynaco, KLH, Wharfedale, Bozak, BIC, BSR McDonald, Garrard, Dual, TEAC, Akai, Shure, Empire, Pickering, Electro-Voice, JVC, Panasonic, Sony and others. The catalogs and advertising helped promote the concept of high-fidelity sound to customers, some of whom lived many miles away from major electronics stores, during a time when only the largest urban areas had dedicated &quot;stereo&quot; stores. Lafayette also offered TV vacuum tube testing, for customers who wanted to service their own televisions.

Lafayette was quick to jump on industry trends, first by embracing open reel tape recorders, and later, 8-track cartridge recorders and compact cassette recorders, along with an array of gimmicks, supplies, and accessories. During the mid-1970s, the company&#x27;s stores were one of few places one could actually experience four channel (&quot;quadraphonic&quot;) sound. However the lack of a single industry standard (Columbia SQ vs. JVC&#x27;s CD-4 and Sansui&#x27;s QS) dampened sales, and the experiment ended in 1976.

Lafayette also sold a variety of electronic musical equipment made by different manufacturers. There were solid-body and hollow-body electric guitars, probably made by Teisco or Harmony. Microphones, amplifiers, and various electronic effects such as reverbs were available, many of which sported the Lafayette brand name, most notably the Echo Verb and Echo Verb II. Among the most famous guitar effects that Lafayette sold were the Roto-Vibe and Uni-Vibe, used by many musicians, most notably Jimi Hendrix. Robin Trower, and Stevie Ray Vaughan; others later used the effect to emulate Hendrix&#x27;s sounds and achieve new ones of their own.

<doc id="1133944" wikidata="Q2370391" url="?curid=1133944" title="Royal Bhutan Army">
<text>The Royal Bhutan Army (RBA; ) is a branch of the armed forces of the Kingdom of Bhutan responsible for maintaining the country&#x27;s territorial integrity and sovereignty against security threats. The Druk Gyalpo is the Supreme Commander in Chief of the RBA. The Chief Operations Officer is &quot;Goonglon Gongma&quot; (Lt. Gen.) Batoo Tshering.

The RBA includes the Royal Bodyguard of Bhutan (RBG), an elite branch of the armed forces responsible for the security of the King, the royal family and other officials.

It was customary, but not obligatory, for one son from each Bhutanese family to serve in the army. In addition, militia may be recruited during emergencies. It may, from time to time, be called on to assist the Royal Bhutan Police (RBP) in maintaining law and order.

==History==
With intense support from India, the RBA was formed in the 1950s in response to the Chinese annexation and subsequent People&#x27;s Liberation Army actions in Tibet. In 1958, the Royal Government of Bhutan introduced a conscription system and plans for a standing army of 2,500 soldiers. The Indian government had also repeatedly urged and pressured Bhutan to end its neutrality or isolationist policy and accept Indian economic and military assistance. This was because India considered Bhutan one of the most vulnerable sectors in its strategic defense system in regards to China. When Bhutan accepted the Indian offer, the Indian Army became responsible for the training and equipping of the RBA. By 1968 the RBA consisted of 4,850 soldiers; by 1990 this had risen to 6,000. Following the increases after an anti-militant operation in 2003, the RBA peaked at over 9,000 in 2007 before being reduced to 8,000 in 2008.By 2017 the military rose to approximately 10,000 or above , and increased over the years to its current estimated numbers .

Bhutanese officers were deployed to UNDOF as staff officers in 2015.

In 2021, the first cohort of women were admitted to the Army.

==Relationship with the Indian Armed Forces==
The Indian Army maintains a training mission in Bhutan, known as the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT), which is responsible for the training of RBA and RBG personnel. All RBA and RBG officers are trained at the Indian Army&#x27;s officer training institutes, namely the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Pune, and the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun.

Project DANTAK of the Border Roads Organisation, a subdivision of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers, has been operating in Bhutan since May 1961. Since then Project DANTAK has been responsible for the construction and maintenance of over 1,500 km of roads and bridges, Paro Airport and Yongphulla Airport (upgraded in 2018, with scheduled fixed-wing civilian flights), heliports and other infrastructure. While these serve India&#x27;s strategic defense needs, they are also an obvious economic benefit for the people of Bhutan.

===Army aviation===
The Royal Bhutan Army relies on Eastern Air Command of the Indian Air Force for air medical evacuation assistance. Indian Air Force helicopters evacuated RBA casualties to India for treatment during Operation All Clear in 2003.

==2003 Operation: All Clear==

During the early &#x27;90s Indian separatist groups United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and Kamtapur Liberation Organization (KLO) had begun to clandestinely set up camps in Bhutan&#x27;s dense southern jungles. These camps were used to train militants, store equipment and launch attacks on targets in India. The Bhutanese government became aware of their presence in 1996, and from 1997 the issue was regularly discussed in the National Assembly. The Government of India began exerting diplomatic pressure on the Royal Government of Bhutan to remove the militant presence and offered to conduct joint military operations with Bhutan against the militants. The Royal Government of Bhutan, preferring a peaceful solution, declined the offer and instead initiated dialogue with the militant groups in 1998. By December 2003 negotiations had failed to produce any agreement and the Royal Government, unable to tolerate the groups&#x27; presence any longer, issued a 48-hour ultimatum on 13 December. On 15 December the RBA commenced military operations against the militant groups.

===Combat operations===
Under the leadership of His Majesty the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck the RBA and RBG, with a total strength of 6,000, attacked an estimated 3,000 militants spread across 30 camps. By 27 December 2003 all 30 camps had been captured. Additionally, the RBA seized &quot;&quot;more than 500 AK 47/56 assault rifles and 500 other assorted weapons including rocket launchers and mortars, along with more than 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. An anti-aircraft gun was also found at the site of the GHQ of the ULFA&quot;.&quot;

By 3 January 2004 all 30 camps (ULFA-14, NDFB-11, KLO-5) and an additional 35 observation posts were destroyed and the militants dislodged. A total of 485 ULFA, NDFB and KLO militants were killed or captured; those captured along with the seized weapons and ammunition were handed over to the Government of India. Captured non-combatants were handed over to Assamese civil authorities. The RBA suffered 11 soldiers killed in action and 35 wounded in action.

==Personnel==
As of 2008 the RBA stood at 8,000 active-duty personnel. This follows an initiative introduced in 2005 by the Royal Government of Bhutan to reduce the strength of the RBA while increasing militia training of the Bhutanese population.

Bhutan has a well trained military force, with formidable logistics and effective tactics, as proven in the 2003 Operation all-clear . Soldiers have high advantage in mountain warfare and jungle warfare , given Bhutan’s geographic location.

===Army Welfare Project===
The Army Welfare Project (AWP) is a commercial enterprise of the RBA established in 1974 to provide benefits for retired RBA and RBG personnel in the form of employment, pensions and loans. The AWP manufactures alcoholic beverages in two distilleries located in Gelephu and Samtse.

==Equipment==

The Bhutanese Army, officially known as the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA), is responsible for the defense and security of Bhutan. Their general army gear consists of:

1. Standard Uniforms:
 • Combat Uniform: Camouflage fatigues, usually in a mix of dark green green, olive, light khaki and grey shades suitable for Bhutan’s mountainous terrain.
 • Service Dress: A formal uniform used for ceremonies, consisting of a dark green or black tunic with decorations and badges.
 • Winter Gear: Thick woolen clothing, gloves, and insulated boots for high-altitude cold weather operations.

2. Protective Gear:
 • Helmet: Standard ballistic helmets for protection.
 • Body Armor: Bulletproof vests, often Level III or IV, depending on the unit.

3. Communication Equipment:
 • Radios: Military-grade handheld and vehicle-mounted radio sets for secure communication.
 • Satellite Communication (SATCOM): Used in high-altitude and remote regions.

4. Transport &amp; Mobility Gear:
 • Boots: Tactical boots suited for mountain and jungle warfare.
 • Rucksacks: Military backpacks for carrying supplies, ammunition, and survival gear.
 • Night Vision Goggles (NVG): Used by specialized units for night operations.

5. Special Forces Gear:

The Royal Bodyguard (RBG) and Elite Units may have more advanced gear, including:
 • Advanced Camouflage &amp; Ghillie Suits for snipers.
 • Special Forces Knives &amp; Close Combat Weapons.
 • Tactical Drones for surveillance.

Most of Bhutan’s military equipment comes from India, due to strong defense ties between the two nations, or other countries. The army is trained in mountain warfare and counter-insurgency operations, making their gear well-suited for Bhutan’s rugged terrain.

==Bases==
The Royal Bhutan Army maintains a camp at Zompelri which is a border outpost under the control of army&#x27;s Wing I at Tendruk, Samtse.

The Army&#x27;s Military Training Centre is in Tencholing, Wangduephodrang.

<doc id="1133955" wikidata="Q7740336" url="?curid=1133955" title="The Horse's Mouth">
<text>The Horse&#x27;s Mouth is a 1944 novel by Anglo-Irish writer Joyce Cary, the third in his &quot;First Trilogy&quot;, whose first two books are &quot;Herself Surprised&quot; (1941) and &quot;To Be a Pilgrim&quot; (1942). &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; follows the adventures of Gulley Jimson, an artist who would exploit his friends and acquaintances to earn money, told from his point of view, just as the other books in the &quot;First Trilogy&quot; tell events from their central characters&#x27; different points of view. Cary&#x27;s novel also uses Gulley&#x27;s unique perspective to comment on the social and political events of the time.

==Plot==
Jimson&#x27;s father, based on a real person known to Cary, was an Academy artist who is heart-broken when Impressionism drives his style from popular taste. Jimson has put aside any consideration of acceptance by either academy or public and paints in fits of creative ecstasy. Although his work is known to collectors and has become valuable, Jimson himself is forced to live from one scam or petty theft to the next. Cadging enough money to buy paints and supplies, he spends much of the novel seeking surfaces, such as walls, to serve as ground for his paintings.

When the novel opens, Jimson has just been released from jail. He seeks money from Hickson, his sometime patron. Later in the book, he tracks down Sara Monday, his ex-wife, and tries to obtain an early painting from her that is worth a great deal. Sara is reluctant to give up the picture, which serves as a reminder of her youth. In the struggle that follows, Sara falls and suffers a fatal injury. Jimson is unsentimental about his life and work and sees himself as someone who has given over to a destructive passion. Yet he regrets nothing.

At the novel&#x27;s end, Jimson reflects on his life and the home and family that he has missed. But he recognizes that he himself made the decision to sacrifice those possibilities in order to pursue his art. It is only clear at the end that Jimson has suffered a paralysing stroke, and can no longer paint. As he is being taken to hospital, a nun who is nursing him remarks that he should be praying instead of laughing, &quot;Same thing, Mother&quot;, replies Jimson, his last words.

==Adaptation==
In 1958, a film adaptation, also titled &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, was released, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay by actor Alec Guinness. The film was directed by Ronald Neame, and starred Guinness, Kay Walsh, Renée Houston, Mike Morgan, and Robert Coote. It generally follows the book, except for deviating from the ending. It focuses on the Jimson character and what it means to be an artist, rather than the social and political themes. John Bratby painted the pictures attributed to Jimson in the film.

==Reviews==

Philip Larkin described the book as &quot;not superlative but managing to catch something of the indomitable soul of art. Really rather moving.&quot;

<doc id="1133956" wikidata="Q7140429" url="?curid=1133956" title="No-show paradox">
<text>In social choice, a no-show paradox is a surprising behavior in some voting rules, where a candidate loses an election as a result of having too many supporters. More formally, a no-show paradox occurs when adding voters who prefer &quot;Alice&quot; to &quot;Bob&quot; causes &quot;Alice&quot; to lose the election to &quot;Bob&quot;. Voting systems without the no-show paradox are said to satisfy the participation criterion.

In systems that fail the participation criterion, a voter turning out to vote could make the result worse for them; such voters are sometimes referred to as having negative vote weights, particularly in the context of German constitutional law, where courts have ruled such a possibility violates the principle of one man, one vote.

Positional methods and score voting satisfy the participation criterion. All deterministic voting rules that satisfy pairwise majority-rule can fail in situations involving four-way cyclic ties, though such scenarios are empirically rare, and the randomized Condorcet rule is not affected by the pathology. The majority judgment rule fails as well. Instant-runoff voting and the two-round system both fail the participation criterion with high frequency in competitive elections, typically as a result of a center squeeze.

The no-show paradox is similar to, but not the same as, the perverse response paradox. Perverse response happens when an &quot;existing&quot; voter can make a candidate win by &quot;de&quot;creasing their rating of that candidate (or vice-versa). For example, under instant-runoff voting, moving a candidate from first-place to last-place on a ballot can cause them to win.
== Noncompliant methods ==
=== Instant-runoff voting ===

The most common cause of no-show paradoxes is the use of instant-runoff (often called ranked-choice voting in the United States). In instant-runoff voting, a no-show paradox can occur even in elections with only three candidates, and occur in 50%-60% of all 3-candidate elections where the results of IRV disagree with those of plurality.

A notable example is given in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the United States&#x27; second instant-runoff election in the modern era, where Bob Kiss won the election as a result of 750 ballots ranking him in last place.

An example with three parties (Top, Center, Bottom) is shown below. In this scenario, the Bottom party initially loses. However, say that a group of pro-Top voters joins the election, making the electorate more supportive of the Top party, and more strongly opposed to the Bottom party. This &quot;increase&quot; in the number of voters who rank Bottom &quot;last&quot; causes the Center candidate to lose to the Bottom party:

Thus the increase in support for the Top party allows it to defeat the Center party in the first round. This makes the election an example of a center-squeeze, a class of elections where instant-runoff and plurality have difficulty electing the majority-preferred candidate.

=== Condorcet methods ===
When there are at most 3 major candidates, Minimax Condorcet and its variants (such as ranked pairs and Schulze&#x27;s method) satisfy the participation criterion. However, with more than 3 candidates, Hervé Moulin proved that every deterministic Condorcet method can sometimes fail participation. Similar incompatibilities have also been shown for set-valued voting rules. The randomized Condorcet rule satisfies the criterion, but fails the closely-related monotonicity criterion in situations with Condorcet cycles.

Studies suggest such failures may be empirically rare, however. One study surveying 306 publicly-available election datasets found no participation failures for methods in the ranked pairs-minimax family.

Certain conditions weaker than the participation criterion are also incompatible with the Condorcet criterion. For example, weak positive involvement requires that adding a ballot in which candidate A is one of the voter&#x27;s &quot;most&quot;-preferred candidates does not change the winner away from A. Similarly, weak negative involvement requires that adding a ballot in which A is one of the voter&#x27;s least-preferred does not make A the winner if it was not the winner before. Both conditions are incompatible with the Condorcet criterion.

In fact, an even weaker property can be shown to be incompatible with the Condorcet criterion: it may be better for a voter to submit a completely reversed ballot than to submit a ballot that ranks all candidates honestly.

=== Quota rules ===
Proportional representation systems using largest remainders for apportionment (such as STV or Hamilton&#x27;s method) allow for no-show paradoxes.

In Germany, situations where a voter&#x27;s ballot has the opposite of its intended effect (e.g. a vote &quot;for&quot; a party or candidate causes them to &quot;lose&quot;) are called &quot;negatives Stimmgewicht&quot; (). An infamous example occurred in the 2005 German federal election, when an article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; laid out how CDU voters in Dresden I would have to vote &quot;against&quot; their own party if they wished to avoid losing a seat in the Bundestag. This led to a lawsuit by electoral reform organization and Alliance 90/The Greens, joined by the neo-Nazi NDP of Germany, who argued the election law was undemocratic.

The Federal Constitutional Court agreed with the plaintiffs, ruling that negative vote weights violate the German constitution&#x27;s guarantee of equal and direct suffrage. The majority wrote that:The ruling forced the Bundestag to abandon its old practice of ignoring overhang seats, and instead adopt a new system of compensation involving leveling seats.

=== Quorum requirements ===
A common cause of no-show paradoxes is the use of a quorum. For example, if a public referendum requires 50% turnout to be binding, additional &quot;no&quot; votes may push turnout above 50%, causing the measure to pass. A referendum that instead required a minimum number of yes votes (e.g. &gt;25% of the population voting &quot;yes&quot;) would pass the participation criterion.

Many representative bodies have quorum requirements where the same dynamic can be at play. For example, the requirement for a two-thirds quorum in the Oregon Legislative Assembly effectively creates an unofficial two-thirds supermajority requirement for passing bills, and can result in a law passing if too many senators turn out to oppose it. Deliberate ballot-spoiling strategies have been successful in ensuring referendums remain non-binding, as in the 2023 Polish referendum.

== Manipulation ==
The participation criterion can also be justified as a weaker form of strategyproofness: while it is impossible for honesty to always be the &quot;best&quot; strategy (by Gibbard&#x27;s theorem), the participation criterion guarantees honesty will always be an effective, rather than actively counterproductive, strategy (i.e. a voter can always safely cast a sincere vote). This can be particularly effective for encouraging honest voting if voters exhibit loss aversion. Rules with no-show paradoxes do not always allow voters to cast a sincere vote; for example, a sincere Palin &gt; Begich &gt; Peltola voter in the 2022 Alaska special election would have been better off if they had not shown up at all, rather than casting an honest vote.

While no-show paradoxes can be deliberately exploited as a kind of strategic voting, systems that fail the participation criterion are typically considered to be undesirable because they expose the underlying system as logically incoherent or &quot;spiteful&quot; (actively seeking to violate the preferences of some voters).

== Examples ==
=== Majority judgment ===

This example shows that majority judgment violates the participation criterion. Assume two candidates A and B with 5 potential voters and the following ratings:

The two voters rating A &quot;Excellent&quot; are unsure whether to participate in the election.

==== Voters not participating ====
Assume the 2 voters would not show up at the polling place.

The ratings of the remaining 3 voters would be:

The sorted ratings would be as follows:

Result: A has the median rating of &quot;Fair&quot; and B has the median rating of &quot;Poor&quot;. Thus, A is elected majority judgment winner.

==== Voters participating ====
Now, consider the 2 voters decide to participate:

The sorted ratings would be as follows:

Result: A has the median rating of &quot;Fair&quot; and B has the median rating of &quot;Good&quot;. Thus, B is the majority judgment winner.

=== Condorcet methods ===
This example shows how Condorcet methods can violate the participation criterion when there is a preference paradox. Assume four candidates A, B, C and D with 26 potential voters and the following preferences:

This gives the pairwise counting method:

The sorted list of victories would be:

Result: A &gt; D, B &gt; C and D &gt; B are locked in (and the other three can&#x27;t be locked in after that), so the full ranking is A &gt; D &gt; B &gt; C. Thus, A is elected ranked pairs winner.

==== Voters participating ====
Now, assume an extra 4 voters, in the top row, decide to participate:

The results would be tabulated as follows:

The sorted list of victories would be:

Result: A &gt; D, B &gt; C and C &gt; D are locked in first. Now, D &gt; B can&#x27;t be locked in since it would create a cycle B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; B. Finally, B &gt; A and C &gt; A are locked in. Hence, the full ranking is B &gt; C &gt; A &gt; D. Thus, B is elected ranked pairs winner by adding a set of voters who prefer A to B.

<doc id="1133957" wikidata="Q4757536" url="?curid=1133957" title="Andrew Jones (New Zealand cricketer)">
<text>Andrew Howard Jones (born 9 May 1959) is a former New Zealand cricketer. Between 1987 and 1995 he played in 39 Test matches and 87 One Day Internationals for New Zealand. Domestically he played for Central Districts, Otago, and Wellington.

==Schoolboy career==
Andrew Jones attended Nelson College from 1972 to 1976, and was a member of the school&#x27;s 1st XI cricket team for four years. He was awarded the Wood Cup for best all-round athlete at the college in 1975.

==International career==
Jones did not make his international debut until the age of 27, playing his first Test match in April 1987 against Sri Lanka. He became a solid number 3 batsman, where he played all but four of his Test innings. New Zealand only won six of the 39 Tests in which he played. Jones&#x27;s batting style was characterised by an unusual but effective jumping method against short deliveries.

He was a batsman who was difficult to dismiss when set, he scored over 140 in five of his seven hundreds. He had a strong record against subcontinental sides, against India he scored 401 runs at 50.13 and made 625 runs at 62.50 against the Sri Lankans. It was against the Sri Lankans that he made his highest Test score of 186 in Wellington. With Martin Crowe, Jones made a partnership of 467 which became a Test record as the highest partnership by any side for any wicket. The innings came in a prolific period for Jones as he made 122 and an unbeaten 100 in his next two Test innings. Jones is currently the only New Zealand batsman to have ever scored 3 hundreds in consecutive innings.

Despite maintaining an average of 35.69 in 87 ODI innings, he never scored a century in that format of the game. His highest score of 93 came in Sharjah against Bangladesh. Jones was New Zealand&#x27;s second highest runscorer at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

<doc id="1133961" wikidata="Q2075270" url="?curid=1133961" title="Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)">
<text>Fleetwood Mac, also known as Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac, is the debut studio album by British blues rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in February 1968. The album is a mixture of blues covers and originals penned by guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, who also share the vocal duties. It is the only album by the band without any involvement of keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie.

The release of the album brought the band overnight success; in the UK Albums Chart, the album reached No. 4 and stayed on the chart for 37 weeks, despite the lack of a hit single. Even though the album has sold over a million copies in the UK, it has never received a certification there. The album barely made the chart in the US, reaching No. 198 in the Billboard 200. As of June 2015, the album has sold over 150,000 copies in the US.

An expanded version of this album was included in the box set &quot;The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions&quot;.

==Background==
On 19 April 1967, John Mayall, the frontman of John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, gave his bandmate Peter Green free studio time at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London, to use as he wished. Four songs came out of the recording sessions. One of them was an instrumental called &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, which was named after the musicians in the rhythm section – Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. The other three songs that were recorded on that day were &quot;First Train Home&quot;, &quot;Looking for Somebody&quot;, and &quot;No Place to Go&quot;. After the session concluded, Green approached Fleetwood and McVie with the idea of forming a new band. Fleetwood, who had been fired from the Bluesbreakers, was willing to join immediately, although McVie was hesitant as he was already earning sufficient income through the Bluesbreakers. 

Green advertised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for a bassist; Bob Brunning answered the ad, but contacted the wrong phone number due to a misprint in the newspaper. Undeterred, he reached out to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; to receive the correct contact information and traveled to west London for his audition. Brunning secured the role as the bassist for Fleetwood Mac on the understanding that he would leave if McVie changed his mind and agreed to join, and was informed by Green that their first performance would be at the Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival.

While searching for new bands to add to the Blue Horizon roster, Mike Vernon had travelled to Lichfield to see a performance by the Levi Set, a band formed by guitarist Jeremy Spencer. Spencer recalled that Vernon was pleased with their performance, which prompted the producer to invite the band to Decca for a recording session. Vernon informed Green of an upcoming Levi Set gig alongside John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers and played him some demo tapes from the Levi Set to showcase Spencer&#x27;s playing. Green subsequently travelled to the Levi Set gig and successfully recruited Spencer for Fleetwood Mac.

On 9 September Vernon granted the band access to Decca Studios for a secret recording session late at night unbeknownst to Decca. The songs &quot;I Believe My Time Ain’t Long&quot;, Rambling Pony&quot; and &quot;Long Grey Mare&quot; emerged from those sessions. Shortly after Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s live debut, McVie left the Bluesbreakers following Mayall&#x27;s decision to add a horn section to the lineup. McVie subsequently joined Fleetwood Mac, replacing Brunning, whose bass parts were unused on the final album with the exception of &quot;Long Grey Mare&quot;. However, &quot;I Believe My Time Ain&#x27;t Long&quot; was issued as a non-album single with &quot;Rambling Pony&quot; as its B-side, both of which feature Brunning&#x27;s bass playing.

On 22 November 1967 the band travelled to CBS Studios on New Bond Street in London and recorded &quot;Merry Go Round&quot;, &quot;Hellhound on My Trail&quot;, &quot;I Loved Another Woman&quot;, &quot;Cold Black Night&quot;, &quot;The World Keeps on Turning&quot;, &quot;Watch Out&quot;, &quot;A Fool No More&quot;, &quot;You’re So Evil&quot; and &quot;Mean Old Fireman&quot;; several of these songs later appeared on the band&#x27;s 1968 eponymous release. An additional recording session took place on December 11 that yielded &quot;My Heart Beat Like a Hammer&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot;, and &quot;Leaving Town Blues&quot;, although the latter song did not make the album. Most songs required no more than two takes, which engineer Mike Ross attributed to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s disciplined approach when recording with Vernon, who Ross described as &quot;a strict producer&quot;. However, Vernon recalled that the band&#x27;s antics were sometimes &quot;infuriating&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

The album sold well in the UK, reaching number four on the UK Albums Chart. Upon release, Barry Gifford (writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;) praised the album, and described it as &quot;potent enough to make the South Side of Chicago take notice&quot;.

Modern attitudes to the album are also largely positive, and many critics argue the album is one of the highlights of the British blues bloom. TeamRock describes it as a &quot;marvellous debut that established the group as the best British blues band of the day&quot;. Writing for &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, Nick DeRiso described the album as a &quot;stellar debut&quot; and &quot;maybe the best album from the British blues boom&quot;. He also ranked it as the 4th greatest Fleetwood Mac album. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; has described the album as a &quot;classic sixties London 12-bar blues rock debut&quot;, while also calling it &quot;raw, physical, high spirited and blessed with the exceptional playing of Peter Green&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; describes the album as &quot;seminal&quot;. AllMusic noted the influence of Elmore James on Spencer&#x27;s compositions and wrote that Green&#x27;s &quot;inspired playing, the capable (if erratic) songwriting, and the general panache of the band as a whole placed them leagues above the overcrowded field.&quot;

In 2023, the album received renewed attention after &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home to Stay&quot;, a bonus track featured on the 1999 re-release, was used in the third episode of the HBO television series &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

==Accolades==
ThoughtCo. described the album as an &quot;inspired mix of blues covers&quot;, and placed it in the top 10 &quot;The Best Blues-Rock Albums of the 1960s&quot;. The album was voted number 435 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>The IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter allowed holes in punched cards to be interpreted and the punched card characters printed on any row or column, selected by a control panel. Introduced in 1954, the machine was a synchronous system where brushes would glide over a hole in a punched card and contact a brass roller thereby setting up part of a character code.

==Features==
*Proof – where the 557 verified, again through electrical mechanical means, that the information printed was correct
*Multiple Stacker – the printed card could be placed in a selected output stacker
*Selective Line Print – the standard 557 could only print on the top two horizontal lines (between the 12 and 11 rows and between the 11 and 0 rows) – selective line print feature allowed printing on one of 26 lines
*40 or 60 column card read – Standard punched card was 80 columns, but there were exceptions
*Master/detail printing – text on a master card could be printed on following detail cards

==Maintenance==
The 557 was a maintenance headache. In reality it was 60 little printers. The sequence was as follows:

#The punched card was fed from the card hopper and read by means of an electrical voltage placed onto a metal ‘Contact Roll’, timing controlled by a ‘Master Circuit Breaker, and 80 ‘Read Brushes’, one brush for each card column, and ‘Wire Contact Relays’ which decoded the data. 
#The punched card acted as an insulator and an electrical contact was only completed in the presence of a punched hole. A control panel controlled what function was to be performed by directing the impulse to a series of ‘wire contact relays’ with the impulses de-coded according to the Hollerith code. (Mark Sense could not provide the current needed to ‘pick’ a wire contact relay and so needed vacuum tubes to amplify the current). After the card was read, a ‘Card Gate’ moved into the card path to stop the card for printing on the correct horizontal line.
#As the card was being read and positioned for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would raise 60 geared ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You can see the maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ in time with the reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would latch (stop) the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.
#A ‘card shield’ would grab the punched card to hold it in place and lower it a position almost touching the inked print ribbon and print wheel. At the correct time 60 ‘hammers’, under spring tension and controlled by a cam, would ‘fire’ pressing the card / inked ribbon onto the print wheel and leaving an inked impression of the character on the surface of the punched card. There is a blank space on the print wheel for non-printing columns.
#The printed card is then released by the ‘print shield’ into the ‘transport belts’ and moved to the stacker.

The 557 was prone to jamming of the lifter bars and resulted in what the CEs called a &quot;rack and wheel&quot; job. This meant stripping the machine down to its base and rebuilding it, an eight-hour job.

<text>SA First, also known as South Australia First, was a South Australian political party formed in 1999 by dissident Labor MP Terry Cameron. The party contested the 2002 state election but failed to elect any candidates to the Parliament of South Australia.

==Ideology and policy==
SA First positioned itself as a pragmatic, centre-based political party which relied on policy initiatives drawn from the experience of its members and professionals. Its flagship was parliamentary reform, which advocated electoral reform, proportional representation, more sitting days and fewer political perks. It also formed a broad range of policy initiatives which were more or less moderate and liberal in their scope.

==Structure==
The structure of SA First consisted of local branches electing a governing State Conference, which in turn elected an administrative State Executive.

The Party was notable for allowing each MP a conscience vote on each piece of legislation before Parliament.

The annual State Conference consisted of delegates elected by the branches and was the governing body of the party, with the power to determine policy, preselect Upper House candidates and elect the State Executive.

The State Executive was an 11-member body elected largely by the Conference. There were positions of president, vice-president and state secretary, elected by a preferential majority of conference for a two-year term. It followed the Labor Party model of political power lying in the hands of the secretary rather than the president; the president directed debate and the state secretary directed the everyday operations of the party. There were six general members elected by proportional representation for a one-year term. The positions of Youth Representative and Parliamentary Leader were &quot;ex officio&quot;.

The state was divided up into branches, based around one to nine electorates. Each branch was allocated delegates to State Conference based on one delegate per 10 members (with a cap of 7 delegates to help prevent branch stacking or undue influence by one branch). Branches had an equal say in the preselection of candidates, with a 50% weighting of the vote with State Conference. (cf. Australian Labor Party where the branches have only a 25% weighting, and the Liberal Party where the SEC/FEC preselection college has a 100% weighting).

Youth Members (25 and under), in addition to being members of their local branch, were also automatically members of SA First Youth, which elected delegates to Conference based on its membership and elected a member of the State Executive directly. This &#x27;double representation&#x27; helped youth membership and participation within the wider party immensely, with almost 1/3 of delegates from the youth wing of the party as well as 1/3 of the State Executive members.

There were also standing committees such as the Policy Committee, which drafted policy under the direction of a Policy Convener appointed by State Conference.

==Party members==
At its height SA First had over 500 members which placed it as the third largest party in South Australia, behind the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party and on equal par with the Australian Democrats. It attracted members from both sides of the political divide who were looking for a new, moderate political party in which to participate, as well as people who had no prior political experience.

==Parliamentary involvement==
Together with fellow Labor-Turned-Independent MP Trevor Crothers, SA First shared the balance of power in the South Australian Legislative Council and made it easier for the Liberal Government to pass legislation; previously they had to convince either the Australian Democrats or the Labor Party to pass legislation. SA First MP Terry Cameron was renowned for asking numerous questions in parliament and for making extensive speeches, the longest clocking in at over three hours.

==2002 election==
SA First ran 30 candidates in the House of Assembly and 2 in the Legislative Council at the 2002 election. They received between 0.6% and 7.5% of the primary vote in the various Lower House seats and 1% of the vote in the Legislative Council. Their average vote where they fielded a candidate was 2.8%. They failed to win a seat, however post-electoral analysis indicated the party missed out by only 2,000 votes.

==Post-electoral history==
On 31 December 2002, SA First was deregistered as a political party. Terry Cameron continued to sit as an Independent in the Legislative Council. Up for re-election, he was unsuccessful at the 2006 state election. His preferences were directed towards minor parties in the first instance, and then towards the Liberals ahead of Labor.

Many members went on to join other political parties, primarily the Liberal Party.

<text>T8AA is a radio station on the island of Malakal in Palau. Its frequency is 1584 kHz and it transmits with 5,000 watts of power. It is licensed by the government of Palau, and it broadcasts news, public service announcements, talk shows, live coverage of major events, and music.

==History==
T8AA Ngerel Belau started its AM broadcasting when they took over US army radio WSZB on with 250 watts on 1500 kHz in the 1970 era. After the independence of Palau, T8AA started broadcasting on 1584 kHz with a 5 kW transmitter which covered the whole nation.

T8AA Ngerel Belau went off air after the AM radio tower at Malakal collapsed during Typhoon Bopha late 2012 and was not replaced because of budget constraints.

In June 2022, T8AA Ngerel Belau returned on AM broadcast after the new AM transmitter installed and AM radio tower has been constructed with Japanese aid.

<text>Straight rail, also called straight billiards, three-ball billiards, or the free game, is a discipline of carom billiards that is the most basic form of the game. The game is played on a unmarked billiard table, usually in size, and three billiard balls, one, usually white, that serves as the for the first player, a second cue ball for the second player (differentiated by a spot or by being yellow), and an object ball, usually red. The object of the game is to score points by striking the player&#x27;s assigned cue ball with a cue stick so it makes contact with both the opponent&#x27;s cue ball and the object ball in the same , known as a . Games are played to a predetermined number of points.

==History==
Straight rail, from which other carom games derive, is thought to date to the 18th century, although no exact time of origin is known. The derivation of the name &quot;straight rail&quot; is not clear, though may be a reference to the pocketless table. An early mention appears in the March 23, 1881, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wherein it is referred to as &quot;the straight rail game.&quot; In 1855, the first public stakes straight rail match in the U.S. took place in San Francisco. The contestants, Michael Phelan and a Monsieur Damon of Paris battled for seven hours, but the high run, set by Phelan, was just nine points. 

A technique soon developed, known as &quot;crotching&quot;, referring to the space near the corner of a table where the rails meet. By moving the two object balls into the crotch, a player could endlessly score off of them, all the while keeping them immobilized in that corner. Crotching was quickly banned in 1862, and players are required to move the ball out of the corner after three points.

Skill in the professional game increased mostly through the refinement of gather shots and the development of a variety of &quot;nurse&quot; techniques. A gather shot is one in which brings the cue ball and object balls together, ideally near a rail. A nurse shot involves careful manipulation of object balls once gathered, which results in both balls being touched by the cue ball, but with all three balls barely moving, or that result in a position that can be duplicated over and over. The most important of these is the rail nurse which involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail, keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again. At the U.S. straight rail professional tournament held in 1879, Jacob Schaefer Sr. scored 690 points in a single at the table. With the balls barely moving and repetitively hit, there was little for the fans to watch.
Although Schaefer was hailed as &quot;the wizard&quot;, the repetitive nature of straight rail led to the development of balkline, where the table is divided by into where only a certain number of points can be scored before the balls must be driven away, and one-cushion billiards, where the cue ball must contact one of the as part of the shot.

Today, straight rail play is relatively uncommon in the U.S. but retains popularity in Europe, where it is often played as a practice game for both balkline and three-cushion billiards, a development of one-cushion that has become the most prominent professional carom billiards game. Additionally, Europe hosts professional competitions known as &quot;pentathlons&quot; in which straight rail is featured as one of five carom billiards disciplines at which players compete, the other four being 47.1 balkline, one-cushion billiards, 71.2 balkline, and three-cushion billiards.

<doc id="1133987" wikidata="Q1179474" url="?curid=1133987" title="Milan Puskar Stadium">
<text>Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium is an American football stadium in Morgantown, West Virginia, on the campus of West Virginia University. It opened in 1980 and serves as the home field for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team. On the day the stadium opened, at an opening ceremony, John Denver touched down on the field in a helicopter, performed the song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads,&quot; and then immediately departed by helicopter. The facility is named for Milan Puskar, a Morgantown resident and founder of Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. who donated $20 million to the university in 2004. The playing surface retains the stadium&#x27;s original name of Mountaineer Field, which was also the name of WVU&#x27;s previous football stadium. The stadium’s design was inspired by Jack Trice Stadium, which opened a few years earlier at Iowa State University.

==History==
The original Mountaineer Field was located on the school&#x27;s main campus, but it could not be expanded or modernized due to the proximity of campus buildings and roads near the stadium. It seated 38,000 when it was last used in 1979. The new stadium was originally to be called Mountaineer Stadium, but the fans ignored this and called it New Mountaineer Field, with the &quot;new&quot; eventually falling into disuse. Mountaineer Field was constructed in 1980 on the former site of a golf course between the Law School and Medical School buildings after being bought out by Oliver Gordon the 2nd. The stadium&#x27;s original cost was $22 million. Upon completion it had a seating capacity of 50,000. The stadium was expanded in 1985 with 7,500 seats added to the south end zone for $6.5 million. In 1986, 6,000 seats were added to the north end zone for $650,000. In 2004 the existing north end zone seats were removed, and luxury suites were added at a cost of $13 million. The most recent expansion actually reduced the seating capacity by 3,500, so the official current capacity is 60,000. In summer of 2007 approximately 500 seats were added in the corners of the north end zone and above the weight room in the south end zone and the field received new turf. There are five banks of lights located on the perimeter of the stadium and one long bank along the top of the press box. There are 12 luxury seats on the first level of the press box, 18 in the north end zone, and 648 club seats in the north end zone called &quot;Touchdown Terrace&quot;. The field surface was once again replaced in 2016, to remove the crown on the field, which was used for water drainage, but is not needed anymore due to the type of turf that is being used.

==Attendance==
Mountaineer Field has occasionally hosted larger crowds than its listed capacity of 60,000; the current attendance record was set on November 20, 1993 when 70,222 fans packed the stadium to watch the #9 ranked Mountaineers defeat #4 Miami.

===Largest crowds===
==Non-collegiate use==
===Football===

Mountaineer Field has also hosted non-university football games in the past. One notable game was a National Football League pre-season game on August 22, 1998, between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Atlanta Falcons. Old Mountaineer Field had also hosted an exhibition game in 1968 between the Steelers and the expansion Cincinnati Bengals of the American Football League.

Morgantown&#x27;s two public high schools, Morgantown and University, used to share a stadium and play their annual rivalry game at Mountaineer Field. With the opening of University&#x27;s new field in 2008, the game moved to rotating between the two schools. The stadium also hosted the 1988 state high-school football championships.

===Concerts===
When Mountaineer Field was dedicated on September 6, 1980, which also marked the first game for head coach Don Nehlen, fans were surprised when singer John Denver made an appearance and led the fans in the singing of his hit song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;. The song has been played at every Mountaineers home game since 1972. In recent years, the song has been the subject of a new tradition: after a Mountaineers win, the players lead the crowd in singing the song.

The stadium has also hosted regional Drum Corps International and Bands of America events, as well as many local high school band festivals.

==Renovations==

Going into the 2007 season, the stadium turf was changed from the AstroPlay surface installed in 2002 to the more popular FieldTurf surface. The cost was estimated to be near $1 million. The turf was ready in time for the 2007 season, even after the end zone sections had to be replaced because they were the incorrect shade of blue (too light).

Along with the new turf, additions to the touchdown terrace on the north end zone were made. Construction to completely enclose the terrace and add 180 more seats were also finished before the start of the season.

During the summer of 2008, the WVU Foundation partnered with Panasonic to install a new video scoreboard at the stadium. The scoreboard has a screen three times wider than the previous one and features a higher resolution. Additionally, a 306 ft fascia LED panel runs the length of each sideline.

Locker room renovations were done prior to the 2013 season. Additional improvements were announced in the spring of 2014, including a new team meeting room, improved stadium concourse, and renovated concessions.
Thanks in part to the university&#x27;s media agreement with IMG, prior to the 2014 season, four new LED boards were installed in each corner of the stadium at field level as well as updated auxiliary scoreboards in both the North and South end zones. To round out the most recent set of updates, graphic banners now adorn the stadium&#x27;s old grey walls both at field level and along the upper deck.

In late spring 2015, work began on approximately $55 million in renovations to Milan Puskar Stadium and Mountaineer Field. The old turf and goalposts were replaced and the large crown under the field—one of the steepest in college football—was removed, a modern drainage system was installed that is more in keeping with today&#x27;s infilled artificial turf systems, and a Brock PowerBase shock pad was laid down. The FieldTurf Revolution surface was completed for the 2016 season and featured a larger &quot;Flying WV&quot; logo at midfield.

Work on the east side gates and concourses, including renovations to concessions, restrooms, new elevators/ADA accessibility, upgraded box seats, graphics, charging stations, and new audio/video systems were completed in 2016, while a new &quot;Legends Park&quot; honoring past Mountaineer greats in an expanded greenspace on the north end of the stadium was also added. A new route for the pregame &quot;Mountaineer Mantrip&quot; tradition was incorporated into the northeast gate, which included a large block of coal in remembrance of the Upper Big Branch mine disaster that was placed on a decorative pedestal for players, coaches, and fans to touch on their way into the stadium. A mirror image of the east concourse will be done on the west side of the stadium in time for the first home game of the 2017 season.
A large new video board, measuring approximately , was added to the north end of the stadium above Touchdown Terrace and the north end zone suites in the summer of 2017. It provides an additional viewing experience for fans to complement the previous board in the south end of the complex, while upping the viewable square footage by almost 86% in comparison. Another new field-width LED ribbon board was installed above Touchdown Terrace along with the new video board in 2017.

For the 2020 season, a new video scoreboard replaced the 2008-era scoreboard in the south end zone. At 134 by 44 feet (41 by 13.5 m), the new scoreboard is 20 feet taller and 50 feet wider than its predecessor. Renovations in 2020 also included new ribbon boards for the east and west grandstands, as well as a new sound system with speakers throughout the stadium (replacing the previous system consisting mainly of one large speaker array in the south end zone, which suffered from balance and consistency problems).

<doc id="1134001" wikidata="Q2551004" url="?curid=1134001" title="Mr. Wonderful (Fleetwood Mac album)">
<text>Mr. Wonderful is the second studio album by British blues rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 23 August 1968. In the US, the album was not released, though around half of the tracks appeared on &quot;English Rose&quot;. An expanded version of &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; was included in the box set &quot;The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions&quot;.

==Background==
The album was broadly similar to their debut album, albeit with some changes to personnel and recording method. The album was recorded live in the studio with miked amplifiers and PA system, rather than plugged into the board.

A horn section was introduced and Christine Perfect (later Christine McVie) of Chicken Shack was featured on keyboards. Mike Vernon, who served as the producer on the album, placed baffles and wooden partitions between the instruments to avoid audio spill. Spencer granted the horn section leeway when determining what to play on his compositions, telling them to &quot;just blow&quot;. The album took a total of four days to record. &quot;Trying So Hard to Forget&quot;, the album&#x27;s final song, was a duet between Green on guitar and Duster Bennett on harmonica.

The band originally wanted the album to be titled &quot;A Good Length&quot;, which would have featured an &quot;obvious phallic symbol&quot; on the album&#x27;s front cover according to Fleetwood, although this idea was rejected. &quot;Udder Sucker&quot; was the next proposed title, and Fleetwood travelled to his godmother&#x27;s farm to take a photo underneath a cow for the cover art, but the record label also turned this idea down. Fleetwood instead posed naked on the cover of &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;.

==Reception==
Compared to the huge success of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, the follow-up received rather muted critical reviews: AllMusic described it as &quot;a disappointment&quot;. Four of the songs, &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, &quot;Doctor Brown&quot;, &quot;Need Your Love Tonight&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot;, all begin with an identical Elmore James riff. &quot;Evenin&#x27; Boogie&quot; was the first instrumental released by Fleetwood Mac.

Sputnik Music describes the style as &quot;vocally conservative, sticking to gruff mannerisms, and it often sounds like Green is drunkedly wandering through the music. The production adds further insult to injury, as it muffles his voice rather than amplifying it and makes the instruments sound murky.&quot;

<doc id="1134003" wikidata="Q199312" url="?curid=1134003" title="Zig Zag Railway">
<text>The Zig Zag Railway is an Australian heritage railway, situated near Lithgow, New South Wales. It was opened by the not-for-profit Zig Zag Railway Co-op as an unpaid volunteer-staffed heritage railway in October 1975, using the alignment of the Lithgow Zig Zag line that formed part of the Main Western line between 1869 and 1910. The line climbs the western flank of the Blue Mountains, using railway zig zags to gain height.

Operation of the heritage railway was suspended in 2012 following accreditation issues with the Government of New South Wales. The railway was aiming to resume services in October 2013, but was then severely damaged during the 2013 NSW bushfires and then subsequently by torrential rain. Repairs and trials of restored rail vehicles and track commenced in August 2016 and it was planned to re-commence limited heritage operations in 2019, until the 2019–2020 bushfires damaged key infrastructure. The COVID-19 pandemic further delayed restoration. Heritage train services resumed on 27 May 2023.

==History==
===Construction and abandonment===

The Lithgow Zig Zag was constructed as part of the Main Western line and opened on the 19 October 1869. Between Lithgow and Clarence, the Main Western line needed to climb the western flank of the Blue Mountains, overcoming a vertical distance of . The alternative eventually decided upon required the use of two railway zig zags where all trains had to reverse. The line had a ruling grade of 1:42 (~2.38%) on three inclines known as the Top Road (above Top Points), Middle Road (between the two zig zags) and Bottom Road (below Bottom Points). The line included several short tunnels and some viaducts.

The steep gradients and need to reverse trains proved to be a serious bottleneck to traffic on the line, and there were several accidents with runaway trains at the reversing points. Attempts were made to mitigate this by realigning the track and relocating and extending the reversing stations, but the problems continued. As early as 1885, plans for alleviating the Zig Zag problem involved the construction of a long tunnel. This was said to provide little gain for the cost proposed. In 1908, work began on the Ten Tunnels Deviation, a double-tracked route that by-passed the two reversing stations and the upper two inclines, although retaining the Bottom Road with its 1:42 gradient. Once this was completed, the by-passed section was closed in October 1910.

===Lithgow Valley Reserve===
The main railway corridor of the Great Zig Zag Railway forms part of a Reserve administered by Government, it is administered by a trust made up of volunteers. The area was proclaimed a public reserve in 1881 which was one of the first public reserves in NSW, originally supervised by Blaxland Shire Council. In 1946, it was added to the Trust that administered Hassan&#x27;s Walls, the trust opened Top Road to road traffic in 1949. In 1964, it added the picnic shelter under number 1 Viaduct, naming it in recognition of H K Cockerton Place. Cockerton served as a trustee for 17 years, instigating the development of the reserve, in 1969, the Reserve was transferred to Lithgow Council. In 1990, the Reserve was placed in the Trust of the Zig Zag Railway Co-Op.

====Revival and preservation====
In 1967, as the end of steam operation in New South Wales approached, a group of steam enthusiasts headed by Ian Thornton were keen to establish an operating steam museum. The Lithgow Zig Zag was chosen as a suitable site based on its accessibility by day-trippers from Sydney, its scenery, abundant water supplies and availability of coal. In March 1969, negotiations commenced with the Zig Zag Trust, the Department of Lands and the Lithgow City Council.

In 1972, the Lithgow Switchback Railway Co-op Limited was formed and this became the Zig Zag Railway Co-operative Limited in 1974. At this time, the Commissioner for Railways only made heritage locomotives and rolling stock available to the officially sponsored New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. Thus the line was relaid to narrow gauge as used in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania rather than the New South Wales to allow locomotives and carriages to be procured from these states.

In 1975, the new track was complete on the Middle Road between Bottom Points and Top Points. On 29 August 1975 1046 operated the first journey from Bottom Points to Top Points. Services commenced on 18 October 1975, the 106th anniversary of the original opening.

On 4 April 1987, the line was opened along the &quot;Top Road&quot; between &quot;Top Points&quot; and &quot;Mt Sinai Halt&quot; and on 29 October 1988, through to Clarence. A further extension to meet the Main Western line at Newnes Junction has been started with track laid for 50% of the distance.

On 25 January 1996, locomotive 1072 derailed after hitting maintenance equipment. No injuries are known to be reported.

===Closure and bushfire damage===
====Accreditation and collision====
In August 2006, the Independent Transport Safety Regulator (ITSR), an agency of the Government of New South Wales that regulates safety and accredits railway operators, identified the Zig Zag Railway (and one other operator) as a &quot;higher risk&quot; isolated line operator because of its complex operations and high numbers of passenger trips. The ITSR gave Zig Zag Co-operative additional time to develop a safety improvement plan in order to comply with the Act, that took effect for all heritage railway operators from 1 January 2007.

On 1 April 2011, an incident occurred resulting in a collision between a maintenance vehicle and a two-car rail motor, between Clarence and Top Points stations. Travelling in opposite directions and carrying one passenger (in the Hy-rail) plus one driver of each rail vehicle, two injuries were sustained. A subsequent investigation by the Office of Transport Safety Investigations found that the principal error was miscommunication. The inquiry also identified that a number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision.

From March 2012, only railcars could be operated and in June 2012, the ITSR ordered a cessation of all services until a number of safety issues were addressed. The railway was then aiming to resume services in October 2013.

====2013 bushfire and storm damage====
The railway was severely damaged by the &#x27;State Mine Fire&#x27;, part of the October 2013 bushfires. The railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages and four accommodation carriages. The most extensive damage caused by the fires was at Bottom Points workshop where most of the north side was destroyed. This included the spare parts stores, offices and most of the machine shop. Electrical equipment to operate signals was totally destroyed as was the repeater tower for the safety radio communication system and the internal telephone lines and exchange. One thousand new railway sleepers were also lost as was the caretaker&#x27;s converted accommodation carriage. Locomotive 1047 which had been stored behind Bottom Points workshop was also badly damaged. Much of the damage was suffered by original railway equipment from the 1920s. At that time, it was estimated that the railway would take a full year to recover from the State Mine Fire. Heavy rain then caused subsequent damage to an embankment near the western end of the Clarence tunnel, the platform area at Top Points, and to the run around loop track at Bottom Points.
In September 2017, restoration of vehicles and infrastructure were still being undertaken and hopes were for recommencement of services as soon as safe and practical. Due to the complexity of repairs and reinstatement infrastructure, the re-opening was hoped for late 2019, but all hopes were dashed with the damage from the 2019 bushfires. The railway’s website and Facebook page both have updates on the redevelopment.

====2019 bushfire damage and ongoing repairs====
In late December 2019, the Zig Zag Railway was hit by the Gospers Mountain bushfire. The station buildings and most of the rolling stock survived with the exception of a few already vandalised carriages. The toilet block, storage areas, communications hut, signalling equipment, water and power supplies and main office with the past 45 years of records were all destroyed along with an estimated 1500 sleepers all of which pushed the reopening a few years back.

On 24 July 2020, diesel locomotive 1004 became the first locomotive to travel from Bottom Points Station to Clarence station since the cessation of steam services in March 2012. Works trains had previously only operated on the Middle Road (Bottom Points to Top Points) due to the extensive damage at Clarence caused by the 2013 embankment slip.

====2020s====
In March 2020, the railway was well into the project of making the rail corridor safe when storms struck Zig Zag, this impacted the return to service the railway was heading for. The ability of workers and volunteers to come onsite was impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in NSW between March and September 2020 and June and November 2021, slowing the progress of work on the railway. Additionally, the railway has been repeatedly affected by weather events, such as storms in January and March 2022. The line reopened on 27 May 2023.

The railway celebrated its reopening and 154th anniversary on 21 October 2023 with a tape-cutting ceremony, pre-booked steam train rides, local performances, displays, heritage buses and market stalls.

==Former schedule==
Prior to the suspension of services in 2012, the Zig Zag Railways was unique in New South Wales being the only heritage operator to run every day except Christmas Day. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays railmotors were operated. Every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday a steam locomotive with train would operate with Sunday having a two train timetable. Special events included Day Out with Thomas and a Wizards Express event held a couple of times per year. During most school holidays, steam services ran every day. Passengers could join the service at Bottom Points where Zig Zag railway station is served by NSW TrainLink services from Sydney or at Clarence which is adjacent to the Bells Line of Road.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==
The locomotives and rolling stock on the Zig Zag Railway have been mainly sourced from Queensland Railways, but there are also items from the South Australian Railways and Emu Bay Railway.

The collection includes Queensland Railways 2000 class rail motors, Queensland Railways Evans carriages, Emu Bay Railway diesel locomotives, South Australian Railways end platform carriages and several older carriages and a considerable number of freight style vehicles that are used for demonstration trains, fire fighting, and track and infrastructure repair and maintenance.

===Steam locomotives===
===Diesel locomotives===
===Railmotors===
=== Passenger carriages ===
During the early 1970s, four ex-NSWR sleeping cars were located at the Bottom Points of the Zig Zag to provide stationary sleeping accommodation, meal and ablution facilities for its volunteer train crews and workers. Unfortunately, these were all destroyed by the 2013 fires.

Five South Australian Railways end platform carriages made redundant by the opening of the standard gauge Broken Hill railway line were purchased in 1972 and these were used to inaugurate services. A set of five end platform carriages was purchased in 1974 from the Public Transport Commission of NSW but ultimately not used when 15 Evans side door compartment carriages were purchased from Queensland Railways in 1986 went into service instead. Subsequently additional carriages were purchased from the Beaudesert Railway.

=== Freight and works vehicles ===
Zig Zag Railway has a variety of four-wheeled and eight-wheeled freight, fire fighting, and works vehicles. These include fuel and water tank cars, hopper wagons, flat wagons and covered and louvered vans. These vehicles have been sourced from NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania. It also had one Hi-Rail vehicle (that can operate on road or rail).

==Film use==
In 2003, the railway was used in the production of the Hollywood film &quot;Stealth&quot;. The area stood in for mountainous regions in North Korea and locomotives were specially painted with Korean Chosongul (Hangul) characters.

<text>Jeroen Aart Krabbé (; born 5 December 1944) is a Dutch actor, film director and painter with a successful career in both Dutch- and English-language films. He is best known to international audiences for his leading roles in the Paul Verhoeven films &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Fourth Man&quot; (1983), for playing the villain General Georgi Koskov in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987) and his parts in &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993), and &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; (1994). His 1998 directorial debut, &quot;Left Luggage&quot;, was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Early life==
Krabbé was born into an artistic family in Amsterdam. Both his father, Maarten Krabbé, and grandfather Hendrik Maarten Krabbé were well-known painters, and his mother Margreet (née Reiss; 1914–2002), was a film translator. His brother, Tim, is a writer and top-level chess player, and his half-brother, Mirko, is an artist. Only later in life did he learn that his mother was Jewish and that her family had been killed during the Holocaust.

==Career==
Internationally, he first came to prominence in fellow Dutchman Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s films, &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; opposite Rutger Hauer and &quot;The Fourth Man&quot; with Renée Soutendijk. His first big American film was the Whoopi Goldberg comedy, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;. However, it was his roles as villains in a string of international films from the late 1980s and early 1990s which brought him international stardom, with notable roles such as Losado in &quot;No Mercy&quot; (1986), General Georgi Koskov in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), Gianni Franco in &quot;The Punisher&quot; (1989), Herbert Woodruff in &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991), and Dr. Charles Nichols in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993). He appeared in numerous TV productions, and as Satan in the TV production &quot;Jesus&quot;.

He was both director and producer of a 1998 film about Orthodox Jews during the 1970s in Antwerp, Belgium, co-starring Isabella Rossellini and Maximilian Schell called &quot;Left Luggage&quot;, as well as the Harry Mulisch novel adapted into film &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot;. &quot;Left Luggage&quot; was entered into the 48th Berlin International Film Festival. The following year, he was a member of the jury at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.

His television work included playing an uncanny psychic in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; series 11 episode &quot;Talking to the Dead&quot;. Krabbé had an exhibition of his paintings in Museum de Fundatie (Zwolle), in 2008. He began working on documentaries for Dutch television about his favorite painters. In 2015 the first serie was about Van Gogh, followed in 2017 by a serie about Picasso, in 2018 about Gauguin and in 2020, about Chagall and in August 2022, about Frida Kahlo. In November 2024 a serie about Matisse was broadcast.

==Personal life==
Krabbé married Herma van Gemert in 1964. Together they have three sons – Martijn (who is a radio and television presenter), Jasper and Jacob.

Apart from acting and directing, he is an accomplished artist (his paintings have appeared on Dutch postage stamps), and has co-authored a Dutch cookbook. In November 2004, he released the book &quot;Schilder&quot;, which is an overview of his paintings.

<text>Anabelle Rodríguez Rodríguez (born December 24, 1950) is a Puerto Rican lawyer, former state Attorney General, and former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. In December 2020 she reached the age of 70, at which point the Puerto Rico Constitution mandated her retirement from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.

==Early life and education==
Rodríguez was born in 1950 in Santurce, Puerto Rico, and obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in History, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras. In 1985, she obtained a juris doctor &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. She has two sons: Fernando Vela, a web developer based in Gainesville, Florida, and Ricardo Vela, a history teacher in White Plains, New York.

==Career==
Rodriguez held various positions in the Puerto Rican private and government sector. She began her career in law as Law Clerk to Superior Court Judge Angel G. Hermida.

In 1997, she was nominated by Bill Clinton to be U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Puerto Rico, but her nomination was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee three times.

In 2001, she was appointed Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico by Governor Sila Calderón. She worked to extend domestic violence protections to homosexual couples on the island.

In 2004, Calderon appointed Rodriguez to the Supreme Court. She officially took office on August 19, 2004, becoming the third woman ever to serve in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. In February 2016, she was acting Chief Justice of the Court prior to the swearing in of Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. On December 10, 2020 judge Anabelle Rodríguez retired the court at the age of 70.

<doc id="1134030" wikidata="Q5464604" url="?curid=1134030" title="Folksinger (album)">
<text>Folksinger is an album by folk singer-songwriter Phranc, released in 1985.

Phranc&#x27;s first solo LP fused elements of her punk rock past with acoustic folk music. She covers Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,&quot; comments on the image of girl groups (&quot;Everywhere I Go (I Hear the Go Go&#x27;s)&quot;), and relays the personal tragedy of suicide in &quot;Lifelover.&quot;

&quot;Folksinger&quot; was released on Rhino Records, and was licensed to Island Records in 1990. &quot;Everywhere I Go (I Hear the Go-Go&#x27;s)&quot; is a bonus track on the Island version.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic wrote that &quot;acoustic folk music had yet to be embraced by the punk/new wave underground, making &quot;Folksinger&quot; a watershed album.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Phranc’s not a timeless melodicist, but her wry lyrical observations and attractive singing make &quot;Folksinger&quot; a fine effort.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the songs &quot;tend to be too slight and specific for repeated listening; they don&#x27;t have the resonances of &#x27;Hattie Carroll.&#x27;&quot;

==Track listing==

# &quot;One of the Girls&quot; – 4:56
# &quot;Noguchi&quot; – 2:56

<text>Andrzej Szarmach (; born 3 October 1950) is a Polish former professional footballer who played as a striker.

Prior to the 1974 FIFA World Cup, he was virtually unknown. He played in the Poland national team during its &quot;golden age&quot; in the 1970s. With Grzegorz Lato at his right, Robert Gadocha at his left, and Kazimierz Deyna in support, Szarmach profited from the absence of Włodzimierz Lubański to lead the Polish attack, the best at 1974 World Cup, with sixteen goals. While Lato finished first in the Cup in goals with seven, Szarmach, with five goals, also marked the competition with his imprint. He confirmed his status two years later at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, winning the silver medal and the title of best player of the tournament, with nine goals.

Jowled and moustached, the Polish attacker had a Gallic quality and thus easily fit in at AJ Auxerre. He won the favour of Guy Roux and of the Burgundian public, by scoring 94 goals between 1980 and 1985. After a brief period at Guingamp and a total of 32 goals in 61 games with the Poland national team, Szarmach began his career as a manager, in particular managing Clermont-Ferrand, then Châteauroux in the second division.

==Honours==

* FIFA World Cup third place: 1974, 1982

<text>Emil Lyubchov Kostadinov (; born 12 August 1967) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who played as a forward and represented the Bulgaria national team at two World Cups.

==Club career==
Born in Sofia, Kostadinov started his career in CSKA Sofia. There he formed a redoubtable trio with Hristo Stoichkov and Luboslav Penev in the late 1980s, helping the team to win three times the Bulgarian Championship title, three times the Bulgarian Cup and reached the semi-final of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

He played for FC Porto from 1990 to 1994, winning the Portuguese league twice, and becoming popular among Portuguese fans. He also played for Deportivo de La Coruña, Bayern Munich (winning the UEFA Cup with them in 1996 and scoring in the final itself), Fenerbahçe, Mainz 05, and UANL Tigres.

==International career==
Kostadinov played in the 1985 FIFA World Youth Championship scoring two goals. He was a member of the Bulgaria national team from 1988 to 1998. He earned 70 caps in which he scored 27 goals.

Kostadinov gained international prominence after scoring two goals in the last matchday of the European 1994 World Cup qualification, against the France national team. He scored his second goal in the last second of the match with a shot with his right foot from inside the French penalty area that sent the ball into the roof of the net. That match-winning goal enabled Bulgaria to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals at the expense of France.

After helping Bulgaria qualify for the 1994 World Cup, he was a part of the squad that reached the semi-finals in the proper tournament, again in partnership with Hristo Stoichkov. He played all seven games but did not score. During the game against Italy in the semi-final, Kostadinov was fouled by Alessandro Costacurta in the penalty area, who later committed a handball offence there as well. Both actions were not given penalties, which sparked a lot of controversy, as Bulgarians accused the French referee Joël Quiniou of purposefully ignoring the situations to get &quot;revenge&quot; for the decisive qualifying game between Bulgaria and France at the Parc des Princes, which saw the former qualifying to the World Cup at the expense of the latter.

He also played at the Euro 96 and the 1998 World Cup, both tournaments in which Bulgaria did not reach the second round. He scored one (and actually the only) goal in the 1998 World Cup against Spain in the group stages. He retired before the qualifying campaign for Euro 2000.
