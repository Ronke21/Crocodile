<text>&quot;Born to Run&quot; is a song by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen and the title track of his third studio album, &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975). It was Springsteen&#x27;s first worldwide single release, although it achieved little initial success outside of the United States. Within the U.S., however, it received extensive airplay on progressive or album-oriented rock radio stations. The single was also Springsteen&#x27;s first Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 23.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was met with critical acclaim and is considered Springsteen&#x27;s signature song. It was ranked number 27 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2021 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, the highest placement for a song by Springsteen. It was also included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Upon release, music critic Robert Christgau took note of its wall of sound influence and called it &quot;the fulfillment of everything &#x27;Be My Baby&#x27; was about and lots more&quot;.

==Composition==
In late 1973, on the road in Tennessee, Springsteen awoke with the title &quot;Born to Run&quot;, which he wrote down. According to Springsteen, this was the first spark of the later song.

Written in the first person, the song is a love letter to a girl named Wendy, for whom the hot rod-riding protagonist seems to possess the passion to love, just not the patience. However, Springsteen has noted that it has a much simpler core: getting out of Freehold. U.S. Route 9, a highway passing through Freehold, is mentioned from the lyric &quot;sprung from cages out on Highway 9&quot;.

In his 1996 book &quot;Songs&quot;, Springsteen relates that while the beginning of the song was written on guitar around the opening riff, the song&#x27;s writing was finished on piano, the instrument that most of the &quot;Born to Run&quot; album was composed on. The song was recorded in the key of E major. Some of the lead guitar parts were inspired by Duane Eddy&#x27;s lead guitar style.

In the period prior to the release of &quot;Born to Run&quot; Springsteen was becoming well-known (especially in his native northeast) for his live shows. &quot;Born to Run&quot; joined his concert repertoire well before the release of the album, being performed in concert by May 1974, if not earlier.

The first recording of the song was made by Allan Clarke of the British group the Hollies, although its release was delayed, only appearing after Springsteen&#x27;s own now-famous version.

== Recording ==
In recording the song Springsteen first earned his noted reputation for perfectionism, laying down as many as eleven guitar tracks to get the sound just right. The recording process and alternate ideas for the song&#x27;s arrangement are described in the &quot;Wings For Wheels&quot; documentary DVD included in the 2005 reissue &quot;Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; package.

On January 8, 1974, Springsteen met his manager, Mike Appel, Clarence Clemons, and the other members of his band at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York, to rehearse two new compositions, &quot;Jungleland&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot;, both of which were lacking lyrics. He continued working on both songs at his home in New Jersey. The original backing track was recorded on May 21, 1974, after rehearsal sessions. Vocals were recorded on June 26, 1974. Recording was not completed until August 6, 1974, when mixing began on seventy-two tracks to the sixteen available at 914 Studios, including strings, more than one dozen guitar tracks, sax, drums, glockenspiel, bass, multiple keyboards and a variety of voices. The core instrumental backing track, which had been re-recorded, was mixed, along with numerous test arrangements, backing vocals, double-tracked vocals and strings, and finally the one chosen for release. Springsteen and Mike Appel were the producers, and Louis Lahav was chief engineer. After finally going in the can, the tapes sat for a year, waiting for the rest of the album to be completed.

A pre-release version of the song, with a slightly different mix, was given by Appel to disc jockey Ed Sciaky of WMMR in Philadelphia, and played with Springsteen as his special guest on November 3, 1974, and within a couple of weeks this version was given to other progressive rock radio outlets in the Northeast as well, including WNEW-FM in New York City, WMMS in Cleveland, WBCN in Boston, and WVBR in Ithaca, New York. It became quite popular on these stations, and led to older cuts from Springsteen&#x27;s first two albums being played, as anticipation built for the new album. When Springsteen did a show at the Main Point, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on February 5, 1975, with Sciaky as host, the crowd sang along to &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

== Music videos ==
No music video was made for the original release of &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

In 1987, a video was released to MTV and other channels, featuring a live performance of &quot;Born to Run&quot; from Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s 1984–1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, interspersed with clips of other songs&#x27; performances from the same tour. It closed with a &quot;Thank you&quot; message to Springsteen&#x27;s fans.
In 1988, director Meiert Avis shot a video of an acoustic version of the song during the Tunnel of Love Express tour.
Both videos are included in the compilations &quot;Video Anthology / 1978-88&quot; and &quot;The Complete Video Anthology / 1978-2000&quot;.

==Reception==
At the time of the single release, &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Born to Run&quot; as &quot;one of the best rock anthems to individual freedom ever created,&quot; describing it as &quot;a monster song with a piledriver arrangement&quot; that could become Springsteen&#x27;s biggest hit yet. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;Springsteen sounds like a cross between Roger McGuinn (from his Byrds days) and nobody else we&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot;

In 1980 the New Jersey State Assembly passed a resolution naming &quot;Born to Run&quot; the &quot;unofficial rock theme of our State&#x27;s youth.&quot; The bill failed to pass the state Senate, owing to some of the song&#x27;s lyrics being about a desire to leave New Jersey.

==Accolades==
*In 2016, &quot;Born to Run&quot; was ranked No. 16 in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 200 Best Songs of the 1970s&quot;
*In 2004, the song was ranked No. 6 in WXPN&#x27;s list of &quot;The 885 All-Time Greatest Songs&quot;.

*The song came in at No. 920 in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;1001 Greatest Songs Ever&quot; in 2003, in which they described the song as &quot;best for working class heroes.&quot;
*It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.
*In 2001, the RIAA&#x27;s Songs of the Century placed the song 135th (out of 365).
*In 1999, National Public Radio included the song in the &quot;NPR 100&quot;, NPR&#x27;s music editors&#x27; compilation of the one hundred most important American musical works of the 20th century.

== Live performances ==
The song has been played at nearly every non-solo Springsteen concert since 1975 (although it was not included in the 2006 Sessions Band Tour) and is his most-performed song live. Most of the time the house lights are turned fully on and fans consistently sing along with Springsteen&#x27;s signature wordless vocalizations throughout the song&#x27;s performance.

The song has also been released in live versions on seven albums or DVDs:
*A 1975 Born to Run Tour rendition on &quot;Hammersmith Odeon London &#x27;75&quot;, released in 2006;
*A 1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour runthrough on &quot;Live/1975-85&quot;, released in 1986;
*A starkly different 1988 solo acoustic guitar performance from the Tunnel of Love Express on &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, a 1988 EP;
*A 2000 Reunion Tour version on &quot;Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live In New York City&quot;, released in 2001 (the song closes disc one but does not appear on the track listing of the album cover);
*A 2002 Rising Tour take on the &quot;Live in Barcelona&quot; DVD, released in 2003.
*A 2009 Working on a Dream Tour performance on the DVD &quot;London Calling: Live in Hyde Park&quot; which was released in 2010.
*A 2018 &quot;Springsteen on Broadway&quot; performance, released on a Netflix special and an album of the same name at the end of the year.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was also performed as the second number of four during Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s halftime performance at Super Bowl XLIII.

On Jon Stewart&#x27;s last episode as host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on August 6, 2015, Springsteen performed &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

==Cover versions==
*On August 25, 2015, the 40th anniversary of &quot;Born to Run&quot;&#x27;s release, indie rock band Superchunk shared a live cover of the title track. This performance also featured ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead and Crooked Fingers.
*A cover of the song appears on Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s 1984 debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;.
*H.E.R. recorded a cover version of the song which was featured in a Dove commercial broadcast during Super Bowl LIX in 2025.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Born to Run&quot; was the goal song of choice for the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 2023 IIHF World Championship in Tampere, Finland and Riga, Latvia.

In 2005, the song appeared in the original television broadcast of Bad Girls. The song was played during the memorial service for character Yvonne Atkins, earlier in the series Yvonne had stated she was a fan of Bruce Springsteen. Due to copyright reasons, future broadcasts and home media have removed the song.

The song is referenced frequently in the 1999 Koushun Takami novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as the main character Shuya Nanahara&#x27;s favorite example of the (in the novel&#x27;s setting) banned genre of rock music. A scene where the song is sung by him serves as an important bonding event for the main characters, and the very last lines of the book are a pastiched, personalised version of a section of the lyrics imagined by Shuya, drawing parallels between the song and the events of the novel.

==Track listing==
#&quot;Born to Run&quot; – 4:31
#&quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; – 3:18

<text>Julius Obsequens was a Roman writer active in the 4th or early 5th centuries AD, during late antiquity. His sole known work is the &quot;Prodigiorum liber&quot; (&quot;Book of Prodigies&quot;), a tabulation of the wonders and portents &quot;(prodigia)&quot; that had occurred in the Roman Republic and early Principate in the years 24912 BC. The material for the &quot;Prodigiorum liber&quot; was largely excerpted from the 1st century AD &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; of the Augustan historian Livy, which chronicled the history of the Roman state from its origin to the beginning of the imperial period, though Julius used it selectively and sometimes added interpretations of the omens and incidents he included. There is a common view that Julius only knew Livy&#x27;s text wholly or in part from an epitome, but there is scant evidence of this.

The work was first printed by the Italian humanist Aldus Manutius in 1508, after a manuscript belonging to Jodocus of Verona (now lost). Of great importance was the edition by the Basle humanist Conrad Lycosthenes (1552), trying to reconstruct lost parts and illustrating the text with wood-cuts. Later editions were printed by Johannes Schefferus (Amsterdam, 1679), Franciscus Oudendorp (Leiden, 1720) and Otto Jahn (1853, with the &quot;periochae&quot; of Livy).

The text of Julius Obsequens frequently makes reference to unusual astronomical and meteorological events as portentous signs like meteor showers, comets, and sun dogs, alongside earthquakes, aberrant births, haruspicy, and sweating, crying, or bleeding statues.

After the alleged Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting in 1947, Harold T. Wilkins among others, interpreted Julius Obsequens as preserving ancient reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Since Julius wrote some four centuries after the latest of the events he describes, his is not an eye-witness account, and for most of his subject matter his source Livy was himself neither an eye-witness nor even a contemporary. Obsequens was interested in signs and omens, not accurate weather reporting.

<doc id="1124684" wikidata="Q632342" url="?curid=1124684" title="God Only Knows">
<text>&quot;God Only Knows&quot; is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher, it is a baroque-style love song distinguished for its harmonic innovation and complexity, unusual instrumentation, and subversion of typical popular music conventions, both lyrically and musically. It is often praised as one of the greatest songs of all time and as the Beach Boys&#x27; finest record.

The song&#x27;s musical sophistication is demonstrated by its three contrapuntal vocal parts and weak tonal center (competing between the keys of E and A). Lyrically, the words are expressed from the perspective of a narrator who asserts that life without their lover could only be fathomed by God—an entity that had been considered taboo to name in the title or lyric of a pop song. It marked a departure for Wilson, who attributed the impetus for the song to Asher&#x27;s affinity for standards such as &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot;. Some commentators interpret &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as promoting suicidal ideations, although such an interpretation was not intended by the songwriters. Others have compared the song&#x27;s deceptively advanced harmonic structure to the work of classical composers such as Delibes, Bach, and Stravinsky.

Wilson produced the record between March and April 1966, enlisting about 20 session musicians who variously played drums, sleigh bells, plastic orange juice cups, clarinets, flutes, strings, French horn, accordion, guitars, upright bass, harpsichord, and a tack piano with its strings taped. His brother Carl Wilson sang lead, a vocal performance that became regarded as Carl&#x27;s best ever, with Brian himself and Bruce Johnston providing additional harmonies. The song ends with a series of repeating vocal rounds, another device that was uncommon for popular music of the era.

&quot;God Only Knows&quot; was issued as the B-side of &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; in July 1966 and peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In other countries, it was the single&#x27;s A-side, reaching the top 10 in the UK, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands. Many songwriters, including Paul McCartney and Jimmy Webb, have cited &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as their favorite song of all time. In 2004, it was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2021, it was ranked number 11 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Inspiration==
&quot;God Only Knows&quot; is among the several songs that Brian Wilson and Tony Asher wrote for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. Asher felt that it was the pair&#x27;s most effortless collaboration, remembering that Wilson &quot;spent more time tweaking the instrumental part than we did writing the words!&quot; Recalling &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, Wilson acknowledged that he himself had &quot;not written that kind of song&quot; before and explained, &quot;I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper ... And I remember him talking about [the 1944 standard] &#x27;Stella by Starlight&#x27; and he had a certain love for classic songs.&quot; Asher concurred that he felt he had inspired Wilson to write the song.

Wilson&#x27;s 1991 memoir states that the melody for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; derived from &quot;a John Sebastian song I had been listening to&quot;. When presented with this information, Asher and Sebastian said they were unaware of such a connection. Biographer Mark Dillon suggested that Wilson&#x27;s inspiration would likely have been the vocal layering on &quot;You Didn&#x27;t Have to Be So Nice&quot;, a recent hit by Sebastian&#x27;s band the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. In later interviews, Wilson said that he wrote &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as an attempt to match the standard of the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (released in December 1965). In his recollection, he was under the influence of marijuana and was &quot;so blown away&quot; with the album that he sat at his piano and began writing the song.

Asked about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in various interviews, Wilson frequently emphasized the album&#x27;s spiritual qualities, saying that he had held prayer sessions with his brother Carl and &quot;kind of made [the album] a religious ceremony.&quot; At the time of the song&#x27;s writing, he was married to singer Marilyn Rovell. Writing in his book about the album, Jim Fusilli noted a closing phrase Wilson had once written to his wife in 1964: &quot;Yours &#x27;til God wants us apart.&quot; In a 1976 radio interview, Wilson said that the song was not written for anyone in particular. Marilyn, who felt that much of the lyrical content on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was aimed at her, commented of the song, &quot;I&#x27;m the only one here, so it must be about me. Then I would think, &#x27;No it wasn&#x27;t.

==Lyrics==
At the time the song was written, referencing &quot;God&quot; in a title or lyric was generally considered a taboo for pop music, and there had been at least one recent instance of a record being banned from radio for having words such as &quot;hell&quot; or &quot;damn&quot;. Asher said that he and Wilson had &quot;lengthy conversations&quot; about the lyric, &quot;because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing &#x27;God Bless America&#x27;, no one thought you could say God&#x27; in a song... He said, &#x27;We&#x27;ll just never get any air play.&quot; He believed that Wilson agreed to the title after being told by other people that it was &quot;an opportunity to be really far out [because] it would cause some controversy, which he didn&#x27;t mind.&quot; Dillon wrote that referring to God may have also been viewed as &quot;a square move&quot; due to the nascent decline of traditional religion in the United States.

In the lyrics, the narrator anticipates the dissolution of their romantic relationship, and asserts that life without their lover could only be fathomed by God. The deceptive opening line, &quot;I may not always love you&quot; was the subject of another argument between the songwriters. According to Asher, &quot;I liked that twist, and fought to start the song that way. Working with Brian, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of fighting to do, but I was certainly willing to fight for the end for that.&quot; In the next line, the narrator reassures that they will be with their lover &quot;so long as there are stars above you&quot;. Marilyn interpreted the opening lines as autobiographical from Wilson&#x27;s point of view: &quot;he knew that I was there and I would never leave him, so he knew that he could abuse me, even though he didn&#x27;t try to. I was never number one, I was always two or three. But if I would leave in some kind of a way, he would get totally distraught.&quot;

Of the songs on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is the most lyrically ambiguous. Commentators have sometimes attributed a suicidal quality to the protagonist. In the second verse, the narrator declares that &quot;life would go on... should you ever leave me&quot;, but if that outcome were to occur, then &quot;what good would living do me?&quot; The suggested implication is that they would end their life without their lover—an interpretation that Asher said was not intended by himself or Wilson. Among other interpretations, writer James Perone, who referred to the song as &quot;one of the more unusual expressions of love in a 1960s&#x27; pop song&quot;, believed that there is &quot;a hint that part of [the character&#x27;s] &#x27;love&#x27; may be self-serving and part of a cycle of codependency.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described the song as a &quot;slow-shufflin&#x27; tender, romantic ode about a guy who is so much in love that he doesn&#x27;t think that he could go on without his gal.&quot;

Asher stated that the intended expression of the song&#x27;s lyrics was I&#x27;ll love you the sun burns out, then I&#x27;m gone,&#x27; ergo &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna love you forever. Wilson commented that the song was based around &quot;being blind but in being blind, you can see more. You close your eyes; you&#x27;re able to see a place or something that&#x27;s happening.&quot;

==Composition==
===Key ambiguity and motifs===
&quot;God Only Knows&quot; contains a weak tonal center that is closest to E major and, in other sections, A major. Adding to this, almost all of the chords are inverted. An E major triad with its bass note in the root position is never invoked, and instead, the position is favored. Of the tracks on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, it is the only one that lacks a strongly established primary key center (others employ key ambiguity to a lesser degree), and the only one that modulates its key up a fourth interval (others descend by a third).

In his book about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Charles Granata writes that some of the musical devices that &quot;God Only Knows&quot; employs are usually &quot;rather ordinary&quot; by themselves. However, in this case, they were executed in a manner that was &quot;far more sophisticated than anything the Beach Boys—or any other modern pop vocal group—had done before.&quot; According to musicologist James Garratt, the &quot;tonal plasticity&quot; made the song innovative not just in pop music, but also for the Baroque style it is emulating. He credits the sense of &quot;expansiveness&quot; evoked by the piece to this quality, emphasized by the disuse of authentic cadences and root-position tonics. Lambert states that &quot;a clear sense of key&quot; eludes the listener &quot;for the entire experience—that in fact, the idea of &#x27;key&#x27; has itself been challenged and subverted&quot;. 

The song contains a recurring melodic motif that is reinforced by the lead vocal and the line played on French horn. Musician Andy Gill identified the verse and chorus melodies as variations on the same line, and added that this type of melodic variation was &quot;very&quot; similar to the technique as it is used in classical pieces such as Delibes&#x27; &quot;Lakmé&quot;. To Lambert, the song&#x27;s use of vocal counterpoints evoked the sacred traditions of a cantata by Bach or an oratorio by Handel. He likened the use of sustained strings to those employed by Wilson on the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; tracks &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Day&quot;.

While some commentators have characterized &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as a baroque pop album, musicologist John Howland argues that &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is the album&#x27;s only track that can be described as such. &quot;Baroque pop&quot; was not used in reviews or critical discussions on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; until rock critics in the 1990s began adopting the phrase in reference to artists that the album had influenced. Howland commented that some &quot;classicistic gestures&quot; are present in the orchestration for &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, however, listeners must keep in mind that &quot;orchestral instruments do not always signify baroque/classicistic textures&quot;.

===Intro, verse, and refrain===
&quot;God Only Knows&quot; starts with an A major chord accompanied by the sounds of accordions, harpsichord, and French horn, which are soon joined by bass, tambourine, and sleigh bells. At this point, the listener may hear the song as being in the key of A, although part of the line played on French horn includes a note (D) outside of that key. According to Lambert, &quot;The ear wants to hear the music in the key of A, and is just starting to feel that it&#x27;s okay to dismiss the horn note [until the proceeding verse section].&quot;

The verses begin with a D chord, weakening the impression of an A key center, and is followed by a B minor6 chord, which does not strongly suggest the dominant (v) chord of E. As the verse develops, it gravitates closer to the key of E on the lines &quot;you never need to doubt it / I&#x27;ll make you so sure about it&quot; before entering the hook line, &quot;God only knows what I&#x27;d be without you&quot;, which begins with a return to an A major chord on the &quot;God only&quot; portion. The verse and refrain then repeats, this time with the addition of a string ensemble, before entering the next section of the composition.

Music theorist Daniel Harrison describes the progression as &quot;highly chromatic&quot; and writes, &quot;in the absence of a strong E tonic, A major seems to fill the vacuum at the tonal center, since it is the chord that begins the refrain, and since it receives a strong tonic charge upon the resolution of the chord preceding the refrain. In addition, the opening chords of the verse, while nondiatonic to the nominative E major tonic, diatonic to A.&quot; Lambert writes that the end of the refrain &quot;recall[s] the chord progression of the introduction but... with an even slighter sense of tonal security.&quot; In a 2011 interview, Wilson commented that the melody of &quot;I may not always love you&quot; resembled the &quot;I hear the sound of music&quot; line from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

===Break and coda===
Like many of Wilson&#x27;s compositions, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; subverted the then-standard 32-bar A-A-B-A pop song format. Following the second refrain, it segues into an instrumental linking passage, described by Dillon as an &quot;avant-garde and unusually jarring transition for a tender love song&quot; Lambert characterizes the passage as &quot;a whirlwind of chord relations... based on wedging-together instrumental lines&quot;.

The song proceeds to repeat the progression of the verse and refrain, however, transposed up by a fourth and with the addition of new vocals. Multiple vocal parts are sung in counterpoint, a technique that is distinguished from the &quot;oos&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; style of vocals for which the Beach Boys are known. Lambert identifies this section as a &quot;choral fantasy&quot; of wordless voices that &quot;climax[es] on a dramatic diminished chord&quot;. Music teacher Richard Battista, referring to this climax as a &quot;sigh&quot; from the singers, said that it is &quot;totally unique in pop music. He didn&#x27;t borrow that from the Four Freshmen, or the Everly Brothers, or the Coasters. That sigh is pure Brian Wilson.&quot; It concludes once again with the hook line, after which there is a repetition of the second verse.

According to Harrison, &quot;The competition between E and A for tonic control is made clear during the break between verse 2 and the recapitulation of verse 1 lyrics... the allusion to the harmonic structure of the verse is made subtle both by the transposition and by different melodic activity. Only when the music of the now A-major refrain is encountered do the voices return to their familiar words.&quot; Garratt writes, &quot;While the idea of presenting the verse harmonies in the subdominant in the bridge was not new, what is striking here is the smoothness with which the song drops back into the original key – a moment rendered even more arresting by the truncated three-measure phrase that precedes it.&quot; Fusilli remarked that Wilson nearly &quot;wr[ote] himself into a dead end&quot;, elaborating that &quot;when the song returns to D Major, it must do so from B minor, which is kind of a static change, particularly when the next chord is a B minor with only a slight variation in the bass.&quot;

The song ends with a final coda that features repeating vocal rounds—a centuries-old technique that was highly unusual for pop music of the era— with triplet fills played on a drum kit. Wilson&#x27;s 2016 memoir states, &quot;I liked all those old songs that used rounds, like &#x27;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&#x27;... and &#x27;Frère Jacques&#x27;... I liked rounds because they made it seem like a song was something eternal.&quot; At its conclusion, Lambert writes, &quot;we hear A major chords that want to provide harmonic stability, but as before, the chords and vocal lines surrounding them make us want to think otherwise.&quot;

==Recording==
===Backing track===
Following several months of recording for the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album, instrumental tracking for &quot;God Only Knows&quot; began at 12:30a.m. on March 10, 1966, at the Studio 3 room of Western Studios, Hollywood, making it one of the last tracks to begin recording. The studio space was relatively small for the 20-some musicians that were hired for the session. Carl joined them on this occasion, playing 12-string electric guitar. As usual, Brian produced the session with engineer Chuck Britz.

Among the distinguishing features of the arrangement is an echo-laden &quot;clip-clop&quot; percussion part, sleigh bells played on every beat, and low-range melodic phrases played on flute during the latter sections of the song. A strip of masking tape was placed over the strings of a piano while the bottoms of two plastic orange juice bottles were used for percussion. Singer Danny Hutton was present at the session, as he recalled, &quot;[Brian] would hear something wrong, and bam &#x27;One more time.&#x27; I just sat there and didn&#x27;t say a word. I had been in sessions where I thought to myself, they should do this and that. Not this time. I just shut up. What could I add?&quot; Bruce Johnston, who joined the band a year earlier, later said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t realize just how great&quot; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was going to be until he witnessed this session.

A total of 22 takes were attempted for the song. The musicians struggled to play the instrumental break to Wilson&#x27;s satisfaction. To address this issue, pianist Don Randi suggested to Wilson that they play the parts in staccato, rather than in full quarter notes. Wilson enjoyed the effect and incorporated the change. A string section was subsequently overdubbed onto take 20, marked as &quot;best&quot;. The session ended at 4:30a.m. The three-track recording of the instrumental was bounced to one channel of an eight-track tape to allow room for further overdubs.
===Vocals===
The first round of vocal overdubs were recorded later that day at Columbia Studios. Brian sang the lead vocal at this juncture, after which he mixed rough edits of the song on March 13 and 22. These early mixes featured a discarded saxophone solo in its bridge and a different, a capella ending. The ending was a fuller arrangement that included the voices of Marilyn, her sister Diane, and Byrds producer Terry Melcher. In Carl&#x27;s recollection, &quot;[E]everybody got in on it. It was like &#x27;Come on out here into the studio.&#x27; Brian would make up a little part. That was fun; we listened to it endlessly.&quot;

On April 11, the band returned to Columbia to add further (and ultimately final) vocal overdubs. This time, Carl took on the lead. Dillon suggested that Brian may have changed his mind on the lead partly to address concerns over the large percentage of singing roles he was granting himself for the album. According to Carl, Brian later told him that &quot;God Only Knows&quot; was written for his voice: &quot;He says it fits my beautiful spirit. I know I shouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed by a compliment but...&quot; Carl quoted the performance instructions he received from his brother: &quot;Don&#x27;t do anything with it. Just sing it real straight. No effort. Take a breath. Let it go easy.&quot; He had rarely sung lead on prior Beach Boys songs.

The coda was ultimately scaled down to three lines sung by two voices, Brian and Johnston. One of Wilson&#x27;s lines duplicated the part that had been played on French horn. Johnston recalled, &quot;at the end of the session, Carl was really fried, and he went home... there were just [me and Brian]. So in the fade, he&#x27;s singing two of the three parts. He sang the top and the bottom part and I sang in the middle.&quot; Of Wilson&#x27;s decision to pare down the vocals, &quot;It works because it caused a perfect vocal-to-track balance, and it&#x27;s not too top-heavy. It&#x27;s brilliant—a fine example of &#x27;less is more.

The 1996 stereo mix of the song, created by Mark Linett for &quot;The Pet Sounds Sessions&quot; box set, does not feature the same singers on the fade-out. Linett explained in the liner notes, &quot;Brian&#x27;s vocal at the start of the fade of &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; is missing on the multi track having been sung by Carl sometime after the mix Brian used on the original record had been created. The part doesn&#x27;t exist separate from the track so... it&#x27;s not available for the stereo mix.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;God Only Knows&quot; was first released on May 14, 1966, as the opening track of side two on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. In its review of the album, &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; referred to the song as &quot;a standard gem with its hymnal feel.&quot; Norman Jopling of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; decreed that it had &quot;a rollicking salvationist flavour but isn&#x27;t going to convert anyone.&quot; Spencer Davis, frontman of the Spencer Davis Group, praised the song as the album&#x27;s &quot;most fantastic track&quot; for a contemporaneous survey conducted by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. At the suggestion of Johnston, Tony Rivers and the Castaways recorded a version of the song, which was issued about a week before the Beach Boys released their version as a single.

Brian had wanted to issue &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as a solo record by Carl, but according to Carl, Good Vibrations&#x27;, which should have been our next single, didn&#x27;t turn out the way Brian wanted. We had to have another release and so [&#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; came out as a Beach Boys single].&quot; On July 18, the song was issued as the B-side of the &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; single in the US. Radio programmers ultimately hesitated to add the song to their playlists due to the word &quot;God&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; reviewed the song as a single, and called it a &quot;very pretty rockaballad with low key chanting by... the Beach Boys&quot; and &quot;a meaningful love lyric teens will find irresistable.&quot; On September 24, it peaked in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts separately from the A-side, at number 39. It was ultimately their last B-side to chart there. Later reports suggest that the song was banned from radio in parts of the southern US, a claim that is likely spurious.

In other countries, the sides of the single were reversed, with &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as the A-side. On July 22, it was released as the group&#x27;s third &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; single in the UK, debuting at number 30 on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart. It peaked at number 2 on August 27, behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; / &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. In September, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; reached number 4 in Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; chart and number 24 on France&#x27;s &quot;Music Media Monthly&quot; chart. In October, the single peaked at number 11 in the Netherlands and number 6 in Norway. In November, coinciding with the band&#x27;s first tour of the UK, a &quot;God Only Knows&quot; EP was issued there. It contained the title track, &quot;Here Today&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, and &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot;.

Responding to the group&#x27;s growing popularity among the British, a promotional film for the song, directed by band publicist Derek Taylor, was filmed for the UK&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on April 25. The film featured the group (minus Johnston) at Lake Arrowhead, flailing around in grotesque horror masks and playing Old Maid. The clip originally ran for five minutes and incorporated excerpts of &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;Here Today&quot;, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. Due to concerns from the BBC over the horror masks, the clip was later trimmed and re-cut to feature only &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. It premiered on BBC-1 on August 4, with a repeat airing on September 1.

==Live performances==
The Beach Boys first added the song to their live setlists on July 28, 1966, at a concert in Massachusetts. Reviewing their late 1966 European tour, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; critic Mike Henessey decreed that the live arrangement &quot;sounded a little thin compared with the recorded [version].&quot; Ray Coleman of &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; mentioned that performances of the song, however, still drew an &quot;expected huge applause&quot;.

On August 25, 1967, the band (with Brian and minus Johnston) performed &quot;God Only Knows&quot; at a filmed concert in Honolulu. Footage of them playing the song at this show was later included in the 1984 documentary &quot;An American Band&quot;. On September 11, 1967, the band recorded another studio version of the song for a discarded, nominal live album known as &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;. The recording was released on the 1998 compilation &quot;Endless Harmony Soundtrack&quot;.

During their 50th-anniversary reunion tour, in 2012, the group played along to a pre-recorded vocal track taken from Carl&#x27;s 1980 performance of the song at Knebworth. Mike Love said of Carl in a contemporary report, &quot;Nobody ever could or will sing ‘God Only Knows’ as beautifully as he did. It&#x27;s miserable that he&#x27;s not there with us. Carl was the real stickler for making the band sound as absolutely perfect as could be. That influence is still felt to this day.&quot; The original performance was released on the 2002 live album &quot;Good Timin&#x27;: Live at Knebworth England 1980&quot;.

==Recognition and legacy==
&quot;God Only Knows&quot; is often praised as one of the greatest songs ever written, as the Beach Boys&#x27; finest record, as Carl&#x27;s best vocal performance, and as Brian&#x27;s most quintessential work. Writing in his book &quot;America in the Sixties&quot; (2010), historian John Robert Greene identified the song as &quot;one of the most complex—and beautiful—songs in the annals of American popular music&quot; and credited it with remaking &quot;the ideal of the popular love song. Granata deemed &quot;God Only Knows&quot; a musically and technically impressive accomplishment that Wilson and the Beach Boys never repeated on their subsequent records. In 2012, music journalist Dan Caffrey argued that the descriptor &quot;teenage symphony to God&quot;, originally reserved for the band&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; album, was better suited for &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. He wrote that the song &quot;has resonated with generations of music fans simply because of its concept&quot;, before concluding, &quot;The entire world will listen to it for years to come.&quot;

Among Wilson&#x27;s associates, Asher reflected, &quot;This is the one that I thought would be a hit record, because it was so incredibly beautiful... I guess that in the end, [it] is the song that most people remember, and love the most.&quot; Carl referred to it as &quot;the classic example [of Brian&#x27;s writing] that takes it to a new plateau.&quot; Johnston opined that the song marked Carl&#x27;s finest vocal performance: &quot;Carl&#x27;s vocal doubling is excellent—especially when he sings &#x27;O what good would living do me?&#x27; He goes up a major third there, and it&#x27;s just as clean as a whistle.&quot; The Wilsons&#x27; mother Audree commented, &quot;What can you say about it? I still think it&#x27;s one of his greatest pieces. I love it. So many times, I have thought how incredible it is that it&#x27;s my son, my sons who did that.&quot; Don Randi remarked of the song, &quot;That one, they should give to every music class, and say &#x27;Here, do this one. Do it a capella.&#x27; Give &#x27;em a key note and see what happens. There&#x27;ll be a lot of suicides.&quot;

&quot;God Only Knows&quot; has occasionally appeared in other media. It served as a musical cue in the films &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) and &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003). Author Thomas Pynchon paid homage to the song by incorporating it into the closing paragraphs of his Wilson-inspired novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2009). The 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; contains a turn-of-the-century barbershop quartet that sings the song while floating past the player on an airship. The song was also used in the opening credits of the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot;.

===Other songwriters===
Many songwriters, including Paul McCartney and Jimmy Webb, have cited &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as their personal favorite song.
* McCartney described it as &quot;the greatest song ever written&quot;. His 1976 song &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; incorporates a build-up of vocal counterpoints in the same style as &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. The song additionally inspired, in part, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;. Wilson felt uncomfortable with the praise and said in 1976 that if McCartney&#x27;s &quot;greatest song&quot; assertion was true, &quot;[then] what was there left for me to do?&quot; In 2002, Wilson and McCartney performed the song as a duet at the Adopt-A-Minefield Benefit Gala in Los Angeles. McCartney later said that he was so overwhelmed by Wilson&#x27;s presence that he &quot;broke down&quot; during the soundcheck rehearsals.
* Bono remarked that the string arrangement was &quot;fact and proof of angels&quot;.
* Barry Gibb said that it &quot;blew the top of my head off... My first thought was, oh dear, I&#x27;m wasting my time, how can I ever compete with that? We&#x27;ve [the Bee Gees] been competing with that ever since.&quot;
* Margo Guryan said that the song inspired her to pursue a career in pop music instead of jazz piano. She said, &quot;I freaked [when a friend played me the song]. I thought it was just gorgeous. I bought the record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote &#x27;Think of Rain. 
* John Lennon, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; co-founder Jann Wenner, &quot;said he really dug [the song] and the world perked up&quot;.
* Pete Townshend said, God Only Knows&#x27; is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared; it still sounds perfect&quot;.
* Webb enjoyed its Baroque influence and felt that it &quot;represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian&#x27;s music. And Carl&#x27;s singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got.&quot;

===Accolades and polls===
* In 2004, it was ranked number 25 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.
* In 2006, it topped &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the finest songs of the 1960s. Dominique Leone contributed for its entry, &quot;if you need a tie into the legacy of 1960s youth culture, glance no further than the naïve but strained optimism locked inside this song.&quot;
* In 2008, &quot;Popdose&quot; staff members ranked it the best single of the previous 50 years, writing, &quot;It is simply one of the most beautifully composed and arranged songs in the history of not just pop music, but Western music. To place &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; in its proper context is to [place it with] 1836 Frédéric Chopin.&quot;
* In 2011, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Beach Boys songs.
* In a 2012 reader&#x27;s poll conducted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it was voted the best Beach Boys song; the editors wrote that it had won &quot;by a significant margin&quot; and added that it was &quot;one of the most heart-melting love songs ever penned... gorgeous in its form and sentiment&quot;.
* In 2012, it topped &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.
* In 2016, it topped &quot;Paste&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Best Songs of the 1960s&quot;. 
* In 2021, it was re-ranked number 11 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.
* In 2022, &quot;The Guardian&quot; Alexis Petridis ranked the song number eight on his list of the 40 greatest Beach Boys songs.

==Cover versions==

&quot;God Only Knows&quot; has been covered by a wide variety of artists that includes Andy Williams, Neil Diamond, Olivia Newton-John, Glen Campbell, David Bowie, Toni Tennille, Joss Stone, Mandy Moore, Michael Stipe, Rivers Cuomo, JR JR, Avenged Sevenfold, Taylor Swift and Wilson Phillips. In 2007, Lyle Lovett performed a rendition of the song during Wilson&#x27;s Kennedy Center Honor commemoration. Wilson later said it was &quot;the best version I ever heard, including the Beach Boys.&quot;

===BBC Music version===

To commemorate the launch of BBC Music, a cover version of the song was simulcast across BBC television and radio channels on October 7, 2014. It featured an assortment of artists (including Wilson himself) that were collectively credited as the Impossible Orchestra. The music video, directed by François Rousselet, showed the artists in lavish, fantastical computer generated settings. The track was released the following day as a charity single for Children in Need 2014.

Wilson said: &quot;All of the artists did such a beautiful job ... I can&#x27;t thank them enough, I&#x27;m just honored that &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; was chosen. &#x27;God Only Knows&#x27; is a very special song. An extremely spiritual song and one of the best I&#x27;ve ever written.&quot; However, the promotion drew much of the same criticisms that were afforded to the BBC&#x27;s 1997 version of &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.

Accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, each of the following performers are listed in order of appearance, singing vocals unless otherwise specified:

Lauren Laverne, Gareth Malone, and Zane Lowe also appear in the video.

<doc id="1124686" wikidata="Q2471239" url="?curid=1124686" title="Good Golly, Miss Molly">
<text>&quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot; is a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll song first recorded in 1956 by American musician Little Richard and released in January 1958 as Specialty single 624, and later on &quot;Little Richard&quot; in March 1958.
The song, a jump blues, was written by John Marascalco and producer Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell. Although it was first recorded by Little Richard, Blackwell produced another version by the Valiants, who imitated the fast first version recorded by Little Richard, not released at that time. Although the Valiants&#x27; version was released first (in 1957), Little Richard had the hit, reaching No. 4. Like all his early hits, it quickly became a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll standard and has subsequently been recorded by hundreds of artists. The song is ranked No. 92 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Song origin==
Little Richard first heard the phrase &quot;Good golly, Miss Molly&quot; from a Southern DJ named Jimmy Pennick. He modified the lyrics into the more suggestive &quot;Good golly, Miss Molly/You sure like to ball.&quot; Little Richard himself later claimed that he took Ike Turner&#x27;s piano intro from his influential 1951 rock and roll song &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, and used it for &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot;. &quot;I always liked that record,&quot; Richard recalled, &quot;and I used to use the riff in my act, so when we were looking for a lead-in to &#x27;Good Golly, Miss Molly&#x27;, I did that and it fit.&quot;

==Little Richard later studio recording sessions==
After leaving Specialty Records Little Richard returned to &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot; many times. In particular, he recorded this song:
* Circa December 1964 for Vee-Jay Records, released on &quot;Little Richard&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;
* In December 1965 for Modern Records, released on &quot;The Wild and Frantic Little Richard&quot;

These are studio recordings.

==Other versions==
In November 1962 Jerry Lee Lewis released the single &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; (Sun 382), reissued on compilation album &quot;Breathless&quot; (1967) and on &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; (1969).

In 1964 The Swinging Blue Jeans covered the song. It was a hit as part of the British Invasion and one of the band&#x27;s best known songs. It reached No. 11 in the UK, No. 6 in the Netherlands, and No. 43 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

A cover of the song appeared as the closing track of the Sonics&#x27; 1965 debut album &quot;Here Are The Sonics&quot;.

In 1966, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels incorporated &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; into their version of &quot;Devil with a Blue Dress On&quot;. Their version scored a major hit, not only in Ryder&#x27;s native Detroit, but nationwide, placing at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100.

Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded the song in 1969 on their &quot;Bayou Country&quot; album with slightly changed lyrics.

In Spanish there are many versions of this song one of them called &quot;La Plaga&quot; performed by Los Teen Tops in 1959. Mexican rock singer Alejandra Guzmán released her own version of &quot;La Plaga&quot; in 1988.

Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s version of the song was part of the &quot;No Nukes&quot; concert album in 1980, and he has performed it regularly in concert from the 1970s to the present as part of his &quot;Detroit Medley&quot;.

The song was also featured in the 1991 film &quot;King Ralph&quot;, in which Ralph (John Goodman) sings this after playing a piano.

<text>James Harvey Cummings (November 8, 1890 – November 1, 1979) was a Tennessee farmer, attorney and political figure.

==Biography==
Cummings was born in Cannon County, Tennessee, USA, east-southeast of Nashville. Other than during the course of his higher education he was a resident of that county throughout his life.

He was first elected to represent that area in the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1928 and served for ten consecutive terms. He was then elected Tennessee Secretary of State by his fellow legislators, serving from 1949 to 1953. He then returned to the legislature and served ten more consecutive terms prior to his retirement in 1972. During this time he became known as the &quot;Dean of the Legislature&quot; and also &quot;The Last of the $4 a Day Men&quot;, in reference to his service at a time when Tennessee state legislators were allowed no salary at all and were paid only $4/day in expense money.

Cummings was very popular among his constituents and seldom faced any organized efforts to defeat him for reelection, and was honored by his peers during the last day of the 1972 session prior to his retirement. Later, the portion of State Route 53 between the Cannon County seat of Woodbury and Interstate 24 was named the &quot;Jim Cummings Highway&quot; in his honor. He is buried three miles outside of Woodbury.

<doc id="1124694" wikidata="Q3509428" url="?curid=1124694" title="Court system of Canada">
<text>The court system of Canada is made up of many courts differing in levels of legal superiority and separated by jurisdiction. In the courts, the judiciary interpret and apply the law of Canada. Some of the courts are federal in nature, while others are provincial or territorial.

The Constitution of Canada gives the federal Parliament of Canada exclusive jurisdiction in criminal law, while the provinces have exclusive control over much of civil law. Each province has authority over the administration of justice within that province. 

Most cases are heard in provincial and territorial courts. Provincial and territorial superior courts have inherent jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases. Provincial and territorial lower courts try most criminal offences, small civil claims, and some family matters. 

The smaller federal court system consists of the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and Tax Court. There are also the courts martial, for military offences, with an appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court. The jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal is limited to cases where the subject matter is within federal jurisdiction and regulated by federal law, and where the administration of that law has been conferred upon the federal courts by a statute passed by Parliament. These matters include immigration and refugee law, navigation and shipping, intellectual property, federal taxation, some portions of competition law and certain aspects of national security, as well as the review of most federal administrative decisions. The federal courts and provincial and territorial courts share jurisdiction over civil actions against the federal government. 

The Supreme Court of Canada is the final court of appeal for all levels of court in Canada. Any legal issue, whether under the Constitution of Canada, federal law, or provincial law, potentially can be heard and determined by the Supreme Court.

The federal government appoints and pays for both the judges of the federal courts and the judges of the superior appellate and trial level courts of each province. The provincial governments are responsible for appointing judges of the lower provincial courts. Although not judicial courts themselves, administrative tribunals also feed into the provincial/territorial and federal court hierarchies. This intricate interweaving of federal and provincial powers is typical of the Canadian constitution.

==Levels and branches of the court system==

Generally speaking, Canada&#x27;s court system is a four-level hierarchy, as shown below from highest to lowest in terms of legal authority. Each court is bound by the rulings of the courts above them, under the principle of . They are not bound by the rulings of other courts at the same level in the hierarchy, or of higher courts in a different branch of the hierarchy (for example, an appeals court in a different province from the trial court). 

=== A note on terminology ===
There are two terms used in describing the Canadian court structure which can be confusing for which clear definitions are useful.

==== Provincial courts ====
The first is the term &quot;provincial court&quot;, which has two quite different meanings, depending on context. The first, and most general meaning, is that a provincial court is a court established by the legislature of a province, under its constitutional authority over the administration of justice in the province, set out in s. 92(14) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. This head of power gives the provinces the power to regulate &quot;... the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts&quot;. All courts created by a province, from the small claims court or municipal by-law court, up to the provincial court of appeal, are &quot;provincial courts&quot; in this general sense.

However, there is a more limited meaning to the term. In most provinces, the &quot;Provincial Court&quot; is the term used to refer to a specific court created by the province which is the main criminal court, having jurisdiction over most criminal offences except for the most serious ones. The Provincial Court of a particular province may also have a limited civil jurisdiction, over small claims and some family law matters. The exact scope of the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court will depend on the laws enacted by the particular province. Provincial Courts in this sense are courts of limited statutory jurisdiction, sometimes referred to as &quot;inferior courts&quot;. As courts of limited jurisdiction, their decisions are potentially subject to judicial review by the superior courts via the prerogative writs, but in most cases there are now well-established statutory rights of appeal instead.

To distinguish between the two meanings of the term, capitalization is used. A reference to a &quot;provincial court&quot; normally is a reference to the broad meaning of the term, any court created by the province. A reference to &quot;Provincial Court&quot; normally is referring to the specific court of limited statutory jurisdiction, created by the province. The term &quot;Provincial Court&quot; is used in the name of each such court, except for those of Alberta (Alberta Court of Justice), Ontario (Ontario Court of Justice), and Quebec (Court of Quebec). The Northwest Territories and Yukon each possess an analogous Territorial Court, while the Nunavut Court of Justice is akin to a combined superior court and territorial court.

==== Superior courts ====

The second is the term &quot;superior courts&quot;. This term also has two different meanings, one general and one specific.

The general meaning is that a superior court is a court of inherent jurisdiction. Historically, these courts are the descendants of the royal superior courts in England. The decisions of a superior court are not subject to review unless a statute specifically provides for review or appeal. The term is not limited to trial courts. The provincial courts of appeal and the Federal Court of Appeal are also superior courts.

The more limited sense is that &quot;Superior Court&quot; can be used to refer to the superior trial court of original jurisdiction in the Province. This terminology is used in the court systems of Ontario and Quebec.

The difference between the two terms is also indicated by capitalization. The term &quot;superior court&quot; is used to mean the general sense of the term, while &quot;Superior Court&quot; is used to refer to specific courts in provinces which use that term to designate their superior trial courts.

In Ontario and Quebec, this court is known as the Superior Court (); in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, as the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (); and in Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories as the Supreme Court (). The term &quot;Supreme Court&quot; can be confusing as it could suggest a final appellate court, like the Supreme Court of Canada; each province has an appellate court with an appellate jurisdiction from the superior trial court. 

Certain superior courts include specialized commercial court programs. The Superior Court in Toronto has a Commercial List created in 1991, a team of judges who have experience in managing complex commercial litigation. The Superior Court in Montreal has a Commercial Division. The Court of the King&#x27;s Bench of Alberta has a Commercial List. 

In Nunavut, there is a single unified trial court, the Nunavut Court of Justice, unlike the situation in the provinces and other territories.

===Supreme Court of Canada===
The Supreme Court is established by the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; as the &quot;General Court of Appeal for Canada&quot;. The Court consists of nine justices, which include the Chief Justice of Canada and eight puisne justices. The court&#x27;s duties include hearing appeals of decisions from the appellate courts and, on occasion, delivering references (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the court&#x27;s opinion) on constitutional questions raised by the federal government. By law, three of the nine justices are appointed from Quebec because of Quebec&#x27;s use of civil law; by convention, the other justices are divided among the other regions of Canada.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; gives the federal Parliament the power to create a &quot;General Court of Appeal for Canada&quot;. Following Confederation, the Conservative government of Sir John A. Macdonald proposed the creation of a Supreme Court and introduced two bills in successive sessions of Parliament to trigger public debate on the proposed court and its powers. Eventually, in 1875, the Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie passed an Act of Parliament that established the Supreme Court. The 1875 Act built upon the proposals introduced by the Macdonald government, and passed with all-party support.

Initially, decisions of the Supreme Court could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council. As well, litigants could appeal directly from the provincial courts of appeal directly to the Judicial Committee, by-passing the Supreme Court entirely. There was a provision in the 1875 Act which attempted to limit appeals to the Judicial Committee. That clause resulted in the Governor General reserving the bill for consideration by the Queen-in-Council. After much debate between Canadian and British officials, royal assent was granted on the understanding the clause did not in fact affect the royal prerogative to hear appeals, exercised through the Judicial Committee. 

The question of the power of Parliament to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee eventually was tested in the courts. In 1926, the Judicial Committee ruled that the Canadian Parliament lacked the jurisdiction to extinguish appeals to the Judicial Committee, as the right of appeal was founded in the royal prerogative and could only be terminated by the Imperial Parliament. 

Following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, in 1933 the federal Parliament passed legislation again abolishing the right of appeal in criminal matters. In 1935, the Judicial Committee upheld the constitutional validity of that amendment. 

In 1939, the federal government proposed a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking whether the federal Parliament could terminate all appeals to the Judicial Committee. By a 4–2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the proposal was within the powers of the federal Parliament and would be constitutional. The question was then appealed to the Judicial Committee, but the hearing of the appeal was delayed by the outbreak of World War II. In 1946, the Judicial Committee finally heard the appeal and upheld the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court, clearing the way for Parliament to enact legislation to end all appeals to the Judicial Committee, whether from the Supreme Court or from the provincial courts of appeal. 

In 1949, Parliament passed an amendment to the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; which abolished all appeals to the Judicial Committee, making the Supreme Court of Canada the final court of appeal. However, cases which had been instituted in the lower courts prior to the amendment could still be appealed to the Judicial Committee. The last Canadian appeal to the Judicial Committee was not decided until 1960.

===Courts of the provinces and territories===

==== Provincial and territorial appellate courts ====
These courts of appeal exist at the provincial and territorial levels. They are superior courts and were separately constituted in the early decades of the 20th century, replacing the former full courts of the old supreme courts of the provinces. Their function is to hear appeals from decisions rendered by the trial courts and to deliver references when requested by a provincial or territorial government as the Supreme Court of Canada does for the federal government. These appellate courts do not normally conduct trials or hear witnesses.

* Court of Appeal of Alberta (ABCA)
* Court of Appeal of British Columbia (BCCA)
* Manitoba Court of Appeal (MBCA)
* Court of Appeal of New Brunswick (NBCA)
* Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador (NLCA)
* Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories (NTCA)
* Nova Scotia Court of Appeal (NSCA)
* Nunavut Court of Appeal (NUCA)
* Court of Appeal for Ontario (ONCA)
* Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal (PECA)
* Quebec Court of Appeal (QCCA)
* Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan (SKCA)
* Court of Appeal of Yukon (YKCA)

Each of these appellate courts is the highest court of its respective province or territory. The chief justice of each province or territory&#x27;s court of appeal is styled the province or territory&#x27;s chief justice.

====Provincial and territorial superior trial courts ====
The superior trial courts of the provinces and territories have inherent jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters, except where that jurisdiction is limited by statute. Though statutes grant authority over small claims, some family claims, and almost all criminal matters to provincial courts, the superior trial courts remain the courts of first instance for divorce petitions, any civil claims, and criminal prosecutions for some indictable offences. They also hear appeals from the lower trial court and decide upon petitions for judicial review of decisions of administrative agencies such as labour relations boards, human rights tribunals and licensing authorities. Superior trial court judges establish and interpret legal precedents in civil and criminal law. The judges sitting on these courts, like those of the appellate courts, are appointed and paid by the federal government.
* Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Alberta (ABKB or ABQB)
* Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC)
* Court of King&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba (MBKB or MBQB)
* Court of King&#x27;s Bench of New Brunswick (NBKB or NBQB)
* Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (NLSC)
* Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories (NTSC)
* Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (NSSC)
* Nunavut Court of Justice (NUCJ)
* Court of Ontario – Superior Court of Justice (ONSC)
* Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island (PESC)
* Quebec Superior Court (QCCS)
* Court of King&#x27;s Bench for Saskatchewan (SKKB or SKQB)
* Supreme Court of Yukon (YKSC)
Many of these courts have specialized branches that deal only with certain matters such as family law or, in the case of Ontario, a Divisional Court which only appeals and judicial reviews of administrative tribunals and whose decisions have greater binding authority than those from the &quot;regular&quot; branch of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Although some of these courts are named the &quot;Supreme Court&quot;, they are not the highest courts in their respective province or territory.

Most provinces and territories have special courts dealing with small claims. The value of such claims varies between $15,000 and $50,000. Some are divisions of superior courts, while in other provinces they are lower courts or divisions of lower courts. Parties often represent themselves, without lawyers, in these courts.

====Provincial and territorial courts of limited jurisdiction====

Each province and territory in Canada (other than Nunavut) also has an additional trial court, usually called a Provincial (or Territorial) Court, to hear certain types of cases. For historical reasons, these courts are sometimes referred to as &quot;inferior courts&quot;, indicating their position in the judicial hierarchy as subject to the superior courts. The term is not a commentary on their professionalism or expertise. In Nunavut, the functions of superior and territorial court are combined in the Nunavut Court of Justice. 

Appeals from these courts are heard either by the superior trial court of the province or territory or by the provincial or territorial court of appeal. In criminal cases, this depends on the seriousness of the offence. Preliminary hearings are normally held in provincial courts prior to the case being transferred to superior court for trial. These courts are created by provincial statute and only have the jurisdiction granted by statute. Accordingly, inferior courts do not have inherent jurisdiction. These courts are usually the successors of older local courts presided over by lay magistrates and justices of the peace who did not necessarily have formal legal training. However, today all judges are legally trained, although justices of the peace may not be. Many inferior courts have specialized functions, such as hearing only criminal law matters, youth matters, family law matters, small claims matters, &quot;quasi-criminal&quot; offences (i.e., violations of provincial statutes), or bylaw infractions. In some jurisdictions these courts serve as an appeal division from the decisions of administrative tribunals.

In the province of Ontario, most municipal and provincial offences are dealt with in the Provincial Offences Court, established under the &quot;Ontario Provincial Offences Act&quot; and the &quot;Courts of Justice Act&quot;.

Quebec also has a system of municipal courts that hear cases such as municipal and traffic infractions. Municipal courts in large cities such as Montreal and Quebec City may also hear minor criminal cases.

===Federal courts===
In addition to the Supreme Court of Canada, there are three civil courts created by the federal Parliament under its legislative authority under section 101 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;: the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, and the Tax Court of Canada. There is also the military court system of courts martial, with an appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada.

Parliament&#x27;s ability to grant jurisdiction to federal courts is limited to matters which are governed by existing federal laws. The Federal Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the provincial superior courts over claims against the federal government, and review of the constitutional validity of federal laws.

==== Federal Court of Appeal ====
The Federal Court of Appeal hears appeals from decisions rendered by the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and a certain group of federal administrative tribunals like the National Energy Board and the Canada Industrial Relations Board. All judges of the Federal Court are judges of the Federal Court of Appeal, and vice versa, although it is rare that a judge of one court will sit as a member of the other. The Federal Court of Appeal is a travelling court. The judges of the Court sit in panels of three, and hear cases in English and in French in 18 cities, from Vancouver to St. John&#x27;s, including locations in northern Canada.

==== Federal Court ====
The Federal Court exists primarily to review administrative decisions by federal government bodies such as the immigration board and to hear lawsuits under the federal government&#x27;s jurisdiction such as intellectual property and maritime law. It also has concurrent jurisdiction with the superior trial courts of the provinces to hear civil lawsuits brought against the federal government. The Federal Court also has jurisdiction to determine inter-jurisdictional legal actions between the federal government and a province, or between different provinces, provided the province in question has passed corresponding legislation granting the Federal Court jurisdiction over the dispute. The Federal Court have the power to review decisions, orders, and other administrative actions of most federal boards, commissions, and tribunals. That means most federal government administrative decisions can be challenged in the Federal Court. Also with the Federal Court, the system may refer back to questions of law, jurisdiction, or price to one of the federal courts at any stage of proceeding.

In the aftermath of 9/11, Parliament enacted a number of laws to protect national security. The Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine many issues which arise under those laws relating to national security.

Appeals lie from the Federal Court to the Federal Court of Appeal.

==== Tax Court of Canada ====
The Tax Court of Canada has a very specialized jurisdiction. It hears disputes over federal taxes, primarily under the federal &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, between taxpayers and the federal government. Also, for most people that live in Canada, it is the Tax Court&#x27;s power to hear appeals under the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;. The Tax Court has the jurisdiction to hear appeals under various statutes. However, as a federal court, it lacks the power to deal with disputes relating to provincial income taxes and provincial sales taxes, and has no jurisdiction to grant any relief where a taxpayer wishes to sue the Canada Revenue Agency for damages. Lastly, the Tax Court&#x27;s powers are also limited by the statutes that impose the tax in dispute. The Tax Court is not empowered to make decisions on the basis that they will yield a fair result. Rather, the Tax Court can only make decisions based on its interpretation of the legislation.

==== History of the federal courts ====

The first federal court was the Exchequer Court of Canada, created in 1875 at the same time as the Supreme Court of Canada. The Exchequer Court was a trial court, with a limited jurisdiction over civil actions brought against the federal government, tax disputes under federal tax laws, admiralty matters, compensation for expropriation of private property by the federal Crown, negligence of federal public servants, and intellectual property, including patents and copyright. The name of the court came from the Exchequer Court of England, which had a similar jurisdiction over tax disputes. At first, there were no separate judges for the Exchequer Court. The judges of the Supreme Court of Canada were also appointed to the Exchequer Court. Individual judges of the Supreme Court would sit as a judge of the Exchequer Court, with an appeal lying to the Supreme Court. The Exchequer Court did not have any jurisdiction to review the actions of federal administrative agencies; this function was fulfilled by the provincial superior trial courts.

In 1971, Parliament passed the &quot;Federal Court Act&quot; which abolished the Exchequer Court and created a new court, the Federal Court of Canada. The jurisdiction of the Federal Court was significantly greater than the Exchequer Court, as it received the power to review decisions of federal administrative officials and tribunals. That Court had two divisions: the Federal Court – Trial Division, and the Federal Court – Appeal Division. Although the two divisions had different functions, they were all part of a single court.

The Exchequer Court and then the Federal Court initially had exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the federal government, but this jurisdiction was made concurrent with the provincial superior courts by amendments to the &quot;Federal Courts Act&quot; in 1990. 

In 2003, Parliament passed legislation which divided the Federal Court into two courts. The Federal Court – Trial Division became the Federal Court of Canada, while the Federal Court – Appeal Division became the Federal Court of Appeal. The jurisdiction of the two new courts is essentially the same as the corresponding former divisions of the Federal Court.

Although the federal courts can be said to have the same prestige as the superior courts from the provinces and territories, they lack the &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; (to be explained later) possessed by superior courts such as the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

===Military courts===
Military courts in Canada include the summary trial hearing, court martial (including general court martial and standing court martial), and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada.

Summary trials are hearings used to dispense with minor service offences. The Presiding Officer will have little formal legal training and is generally the service member&#x27;s Commanding Officer. In this respect, these hearings are similar to the former lay magistrates&#x27; courts.

The courts martial are conducted and presided over by military personnel and exist for the prosecution of military personnel, as well as civilian personnel who accompany military personnel, accused of violating the &quot;Code of Service Discipline&quot;, which is found in the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; and constitutes a complete code of military law applicable to persons under military jurisdiction.

The decisions of the courts martial can be appealed to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada which, in contrast, exists outside the military and is made up of civilian judges. This appellate court is the successor of the Court Martial Appeal Board which was created in 1950, presided over by civilian judges and lawyers, and was the first ever civilian-based adjudicating body with authority to review decisions by a military court. The Court Martial Appeal Court is made up of civilian judges from the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and the superior courts of the provinces.

===Administrative tribunals===

Known in Canada as simply &quot;tribunals&quot;, these are quasi-judicial adjudicative bodies, which means that they hear evidence and render decisions like courts, but are not necessarily presided over by judges. Instead, the adjudicators may be experts in the subject matter handled by the tribunal (e.g., labour law, human rights law, immigration law, energy law, workers&#x27; compensation law, liquor licensing law, etc.). Adjudicators hear arguments and receive evidence from parties before making a decision.

Adjudicative functions which can be given to provincially appointed administrative tribunals are limited by section 96 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867,&quot; as this section will be violated where an adjudicative function is the sole or central aspect of a tribunal, and where that power broadly conforms to one that was exercised by superior courts at the time of Confederation. This has not significantly affected the ability of provincial governments to establish expert administrative tribunals, and there have been few challenges of this kind to administrative tribunal powers.

Depending on its enabling legislation, a tribunal&#x27;s decisions may be reviewed by a court through an appeal or a process called judicial review. The reviewing court may be required to show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized expertise or knowledge that the court does not have. The degree of deference will also depend on such factors as the specific wording of the legislation creating the tribunal. Tribunals whose enabling legislation contains a privative clause are entitled to a high degree of deference, although a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada has arguably lowered that degree of deference.

Tribunals which have the power to decide questions of law may take into consideration the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which is part of Canada&#x27;s constitution. The extent to which tribunals may use the Charter in their decisions is a source of ongoing legal debate.

Appearing before some administrative tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal&#x27;s procedure is relatively less formal than that of a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, so that some evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While relevant evidence is admissible, evidence which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight.

As with courts, lawyers routinely appear in tribunals as representatives of their clients. A person does not require a lawyer to appear before an administrative tribunal. Indeed, many of these tribunals are specifically designed to be more representative to unrepresented litigants than courts. Some tribunals are part of a comprehensive dispute-resolution system, which may emphasize mediation rather than litigation. For example, provincial human rights commissions routinely use mediation to resolve many human rights complaints without the need for a hearing.

What tribunals all have in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually appointed by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subjects (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers&#x27; compensation) are within provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subjects, such as unionized labour and human rights.

The principle of does not apply to tribunals. In other words, a tribunal adjudicator could legally make a decision that differs from a past decision, on the same subject and issues, delivered by the highest court in the land. Because a tribunal is not bound by legal precedent, established by itself or by a reviewing court, a tribunal is not a court even though it performs an important adjudicative function and contributes to the development of law like a court would do.

Although &quot;stare decisis&quot; does not apply to tribunals, their adjudicators will likely nonetheless find a prior court decision on a similar subject to be highly persuasive and will likely follow the courts in order to ensure consistency in the law and to prevent the embarrassment of having their decisions overturned by the courts. The same is usually true for past decisions of the tribunal.

Among the federal tribunals, there is a small group of tribunals whose decisions must be appealed directly to the Federal Court of Appeal rather than to the Federal Court Trial Division. These so-called &quot;super tribunals&quot; are listed in subsection 28(1) of the &quot;Federal Courts Act&quot; and some examples include the National Energy Board, Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (&quot;i.e.&quot;, federal labour board), the Copyright Board and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

==Judicial independence==

The judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government with constitutional status. Judicial independence is a constitutional principle, and is necessary to protect the rule of law.

The constitutional principle of judicial independence is protected for provincial superior court judges by sections 96 to 100 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; which guarantees judicial tenure and salaries. It is also constitutionally protected for judges hearing criminal matters by section 11(d) of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the principle of judicial independence is a foundational structural component of the Constitution of Canada and applies to all judges and courts, without an express written guarantee of judicial independence. The Supreme Court relied in part on the preamble to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; in its decision on this point.

Judicial independence has two aspects: the autonomy and independence of judges from other branches of government, and immunity from legal consequences for actions which are taken in the performance of judicial functions.

=== &quot;Reference Re Remuneration of Judges&quot; ===

In &quot;Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court&quot;, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Constitution of Canada includes an unwritten constitutional principle of judicial independence, recognized by the preamble to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867.&quot;

The issue at stake was whether provincial legislatures&#x27; measures reducing salaries of provincial court judges were constitutionally valid. The majority held that provinces are constitutionally obliged to establish judicial compensation commissions. The effect of this decision was that the Constitution requires salaries of provincial court judges to be protected in some manner, but this protection need not be identical to that of superior courts.

A further Supreme Court decision in &quot;Provincial Court Judges&#x27; Assn of New Brunswick v New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)&quot; clarified that salary review commission recommendations are not binding, and departures from advisory recommendations may be justified so long as &quot;rational&quot; reasons are provided. After the previous decision in 1997, substantial increases in salaries were recommended by some judicial compensation commissions, and not all such recommendations were accepted by governments. A unanimous Court expressed a desire to avoid further disputes by clarifying the role of the commission process.

==== Reasons of the majority ====
It was held that the right to judicial independence was thus extended to provincial court judges in the following core characteristics:

:* security of tenure (ie, judges can only be removed for cause, after an inquiry in which he must be given a full opportunity to be heard)
:* financial security (ie, the right to salary of a provincial court judge is established by law, and there is no way in which the Executive can interfere with that right in a manner to affect the independence of the individual judge)
:* administrative independence (which is the control by the courts over the administrative decisions that bear directly and immediately on the exercise of the judicial function)

In addition, there are two dimensions of judicial independence:

:* the individual independence of a judge, and
:* the institutional or collective independence of the court or tribunal of which that judge is a member

The relationship between these two aspects of judicial independence is that an individual judge may enjoy the essential conditions of judicial independence but if the court or tribunal over which the judge presides is not independent of the other branches of government, in what is essential to its function, the judge cannot be said to be an independent tribunal.

With respect to its applicability to protecting the financial security of judges&#x27; salaries, the following principles were stated:

:* salaries of provincial courts may be varied, but only after undertaking an independent, effective, and objective process by an independent body;
:* under no circumstances is it permissible for the judiciary — not only collectively through representative organizations, but also as individuals — to engage in negotiations over remuneration with the executive or representatives of the legislature;
:* any reductions to judicial remuneration, including &quot;de facto&quot; reductions through the erosion of judicial salaries by inflation, cannot take those salaries below a basic minimum level of remuneration which is required for the office of a judge.

==Inherent versus statutory jurisdiction==

=== Courts of inherent jurisdiction ===
The superior courts from the provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, which means that the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.

===Statutory courts===
The Supreme Court of Canada, the federal courts, the various appellate courts from the provinces and territories, and the numerous low-level provincial courts are statutory courts whose decision-making power is granted by either the federal parliament or a provincial legislature.

The word &quot;statutory&quot; refers to the fact that these courts&#x27; powers are derived from a statute and is defined and limited by the terms of the statute. A statutory court cannot try cases in areas of law that are not mentioned or suggested in the statute. In this sense, statutory courts are similar to non-judicial adjudicative bodies such as administrative tribunals, boards, and commissions, which are created and given limited power by legislation. The practical implication of this is that a statutory court cannot provide a type of legal remedy or relief that is not expressly or implicitly referred to in its enabling or empowering statute.

==Appointment and removal of judges==

Judges in Canada are appointed by either the federal government, the provincial governments, or the territorial governments, depending on the court. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, the federal courts, and the provincial and territorial superior appellate and trial courts are appointed by the Governor General of Canada, acting on the advice of the federal Cabinet. Judicial appointments to provincial courts of statutory jurisdiction are made by the provincial governments.

Salaries of provincial superior courts are set by Parliament under section 100 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and paid by the federal government. Since the &quot;Provincial Judges Reference&quot;, salaries for all federally appointed judges are based on recommendations of the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. Similar commissions are established by each province to recommend the salaries for provincially appointed judges, who are paid by the provincial governments.

===Tenure of judges and removal from the bench===
Federally appointed judges are eligible to serve on the bench until age 75. In some but not all provincial and territorial courts, appointed judges have tenure until age 70 instead.

Under section 99 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867,&quot; judges of the superior courts of the provinces hold office &quot;during good behaviour, but shall be removable by the Governor General on Address of the Senate and House of Commons&quot;. To protect the principle of judicial independence, Parliament has, by statute, delegated authority to investigate complaints against judges and recommend their removal to the Canadian Judicial Council. The Council includes the Chief Justice of Canada, and the chief justice and associate chief justices of each provincial and territorial superior court. 

The federal &quot;Judges Act&quot; outlines the justifiable grounds for removing a federally-appointed judge from office, and allows for complaints against those judges to be made to the Council by any person, including members of the public. The federal Minister of Justice or the attorney general of a province may also request that the Council establish a hearing panel to consider whether a judge of a superior court should be removed.

Judges may only be removed from office for specified reasons, such as infirmity or misconduct, and only where their continuing in office would undermine public confidence in the judge&#x27;s impartiality, integrity or independence enough that the judge is incapable of executing their role. 

The Council provides reports concerning the outcome of complaints and recommendations concerning removal from office to the federal Minister of Justice. To remove a judge from office, the House of Commons and Senate must both pass a resolution.

No superior court judge has been removed from office under section 99 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, though on several occasions judges have resigned where it appeared likely that the Senate and House of Commons would pass a resolution seeking their dismissal.

The rules for provincial and territorial judges are similar, but they can be removed under statutory authority of the relevant province or territory.

==Languages used in court==
English and French are both official languages of the federal government of Canada. Either official language may be used by any person or in any pleading or process in or issuing from any court established by Parliament under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. This constitutional guarantee applies to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and the Court Martial Appeal Court. Parliament has expanded on that constitutional guarantee to ensure the federal courts are institutionally bilingual.

The right to use either language in the provincial and territorial courts varies. The Constitution guarantees the right to use either French or English in the courts of Quebec, Manitoba, and New Brunswick. There is a statutory right to use either English or French in the courts of Ontario, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, and Yukon. There is a limited right to use French in oral submissions in the courts of Alberta.

In the Northwest Territories and Nunavut there is also a statutory right to use official aboriginal languages in court.

As well, in all criminal trials under the federal &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, every accused has the right to be tried in the official language of their choice, either English or French. This is a broader right than the right to use their own language. It means that the judge, the Crown prosecutor and the court clerks also use that language in the court proceedings. As a result, every court of criminal jurisdiction in Canada, whether federal, provincial or territorial, must have the institutional capacity to provide trials in either language.

Under section 14 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, a party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.

==Procedure==

* The judicial function of the Royal Prerogative is performed in trust and in the King&#x27;s name by officers of His Majesty&#x27;s court, who enjoy the privilege granted conditionally by the sovereign to be free from criminal and civil liability for unsworn statements made within the court. This dispensation extends from the notion in common law that the sovereign &quot;can do no wrong&quot;.
* Trial judges typically take a passive role during trial; however, during their charge to the jury, judges may comment upon the value of certain testimony or suggest the appropriate amount of damages in a civil case, although they are required to tell the jury that it is to make its own decision and is not bound to agree with the judge.
* Jury trials are usually reserved for serious criminal cases. The &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; provides a constitutional right to a jury trial for any person charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. This right has been expanded by the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which provides that any person charged with an indictable offence has a right to a jury. 
* There are no juries in civil cases in the Federal Court or the courts of Quebec, but there are civil juries in the other nine provinces. Only British Columbia and Ontario regularly use juries in civil trials.
* Evidence and documents are not passed directly to the judge, but instead passed to the judge through the court clerk. The clerk, referred to as &quot;Mister/Madam Clerk&quot; or &quot;Mister/Madam Registrar&quot;, also wears a robe and sits in front of the judge and faces the lawyers.
* In some jurisdictions, the client sits with the general public, behind counsel&#x27;s table, rather than beside his or her lawyer at counsel&#x27;s table. The accused in a criminal trial sits in the prisoners box often located on the side wall opposite the jury, or in the middle of the courtroom. However it is becoming increasingly common for accused persons to sit at counsel table with their lawyers or in the body of the courtroom, particularly when the accused is not in custody.
* In four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario), the superior-level courts employ judicial officers known as Masters or Associate Justices who deal with interlocutory motions (or interlocutory applications) in civil cases. In some jurisdictions, Masters may grant final orders in specific types of cases, such as the administration of estates, foreclosures and bankruptcy proceedings. In the Federal Court, a Associate Justice holds a similar positions to that of a Master.

==Court customs==

Courtroom custom is largely based upon the British tradition, with a few modifications.

===Symbols===
Historically, the Crown was said to be the source of justice, with the king personally dispensing justice, a concept that survives in the phrase &quot;the King on the Bench&quot;. As a result, in some courtrooms there may be symbols of the Crown, such as a picture of the monarch or the royal Arms of Canada, while some courtrooms may display the provincial arms or a dedicated judicial arms. In the British Columbia courts as well as in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador and some courts in Ontario, the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom is displayed for reasons of tradition. Many courts display Canadian and provincial flags.

===Dress===

In superior courts, lawyers wear black robes, black waistcoats, and white neck tabs, like barristers in the United Kingdom, but they do not wear wigs. Business attire is appropriate when appearing before judges of superior courts sitting in chambers and before judges of provincial or territorial courts or justices of the peace.

Judges dress in robes similar to the robes of barristers. Judges of some courts adorn their robes with coloured sashes. For example, Federal Court Judges&#x27; robes are adorned with a gold sash, and Tax Court of Canada Judges&#x27; robes with a purple sash. 

===Etiquette/Decorum===
* Judges do not use gavels. Instead, a judge raises their voice (or stands up if necessary) to restore order in the courtroom.
* In most jurisdictions, when entering or leaving a courtroom when there is a judge seated inside, one should bow, while standing inside the court but near the doorway, in the direction of the seated judge. Many lawyers also bow when crossing the bar.
* Forms of address vary among courts. Judges of superior courts in some provinces are traditionally addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady,&quot; but in other provinces are referred to as &quot;Your Honour&quot;. Judges of inferior courts are always traditionally referred to in person as &quot;Your Honour&quot;. The practice varies across jurisdictions, with some superior court judges preferring the titles &quot;Mister Justice&quot; or &quot;Madam Justice&quot; to &quot;Lordship&quot;. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and of the federal-level courts prefer the use of &quot;Mister/Madam (Chief) Justice&quot;. Justices of the Peace are addressed as &quot;Your Worship&quot;. The French-language style used in Quebec is in all levels of court, although some lawyers unofficially say or (your lordship).
* Judges of inferior courts are referred to as &quot;Judge [Surname]&quot; while judges of superior and federal courts are referred to as &quot;Mister/Madam Justice [Surname],&quot; except in Ontario, where all trial judges in referred to as &quot;Mister/Madam Justice&quot;.
* A lawyer advocating in court typically uses &quot;I&quot; when referring to him or herself. The word &quot;we&quot; is not used, even if the lawyer is referring to him/herself and his/her client as a group.
* The judge in court refers to a lawyer as &quot;counsel&quot; (not &quot;counsellor&quot;), or simply &quot;Mr./Ms. [surname]&quot;. In Quebec, the title &quot;&quot; is used. In British Columbia, lawyers should inform the Court of the title and pronouns that they, their clients, and other persons present use.
* In court, it is customary for opposing counsel to refer to one another as &quot;my friend&quot;, or sometimes (usually in the case of King&#x27;s Counsel) &quot;my learned friend&quot;.
* In any criminal law case, the prosecuting party is &quot;the Crown&quot; while the criminally prosecuted person is called the &quot;accused&quot; (not &quot;defendant,&quot; the term used in civil proceedings). The prosecuting lawyer is called &quot;Crown Counsel&quot; (or, in Ontario, &quot;Crown attorney&quot;). Crown counsel in criminal proceedings are customarily addressed and referred to as &quot;Mr. Crown&quot; or &quot;Madam Crown.&quot;
* The &quot;versus&quot; or &quot;v.&quot; in the style of cause of Canadian court cases is often pronounced &quot;and&quot; (rather than &quot;vee&quot; or &quot;versus&quot; as in the U.S. or &quot;against&quot; in criminal proceedings as in England, Scotland, and Australasia).

<text>The Kripke–Platek set theory (KP), pronounced , is an axiomatic set theory developed by Saul Kripke and Richard Platek.
The theory can be thought of as roughly the predicative part of ZFC and is considerably weaker than it. 

== Axioms ==
In its formulation, a Δ0 formula is one all of whose quantifiers are bounded. This means any quantification is the form formula_1 or formula_2 (See the Lévy hierarchy.)

* Axiom of extensionality: Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements.
* Axiom of induction: φ(&quot;a&quot;) being a formula, if for all sets &quot;x&quot; the assumption that φ(&quot;y&quot;) holds for all elements &quot;y&quot; of &quot;x&quot; entails that φ(&quot;x&quot;) holds, then φ(&quot;x&quot;) holds for all sets &quot;x&quot;.
* Axiom of empty set: There exists a set with no members, called the empty set and denoted {}.
* Axiom of pairing: If &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; are sets, then so is {&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;}, a set containing &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; as its only elements.
* Axiom of union: For any set &quot;x&quot;, there is a set &quot;y&quot; such that the elements of &quot;y&quot; are precisely the elements of the elements of &quot;x&quot;.
* Axiom of Δ0-separation: Given any set and any Δ0 formula φ(&quot;x&quot;), there is a subset of the original set containing precisely those elements &quot;x&quot; for which φ(&quot;x&quot;) holds. (This is an axiom schema.)
* Axiom of Δ0-collection: Given any Δ0 formula φ(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), if for every set &quot;x&quot; there exists a set &quot;y&quot; such that φ(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) holds, then for all sets &quot;X&quot; there exists a set &quot;Y&quot; such that for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; there is a &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; such that φ(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) holds.

Some but not all authors include an 
* Axiom of infinity

KP with infinity is denoted by KPω. These axioms lead to close connections between KP, generalized recursion theory, and the theory of admissible ordinals.
KP can be studied as a constructive set theory by dropping the law of excluded middle, without changing any axioms.

=== Empty set ===
If any set formula_3 is postulated to exist, such as in the axiom of infinity, then the axiom of empty set is redundant because it is equal to the subset formula_4. Furthermore, the existence of a member in the universe of discourse, i.e., ∃x(x=x), is implied in certain formulations of first-order logic, in which case the axiom of empty set follows from the axiom of Δ0-separation, and is thus redundant.

=== Comparison with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ===
As noted, the above are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the power set axiom, choice, and sometimes infinity. Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas φ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only.

The axiom of induction in the context of KP is stronger than the usual axiom of regularity, which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set).

== Related definitions ==
* A set formula_5 is called admissible if it is transitive and formula_6 is a model of Kripke–Platek set theory.
* An ordinal number &quot;formula_7&quot; is called an admissible ordinal if formula_8 is an admissible set.
* formula_8 is called an amenable set if it is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Δ0-collection.

== Theorems ==

=== Admissible sets ===
The ordinal &quot;α&quot; is an admissible ordinal if and only if &quot;α&quot; is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a &quot;γ&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot; for which there is a Σ1(L&quot;α&quot;) mapping from &quot;γ&quot; onto &quot;α&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in &quot;M&quot; is an admissible ordinal.

=== Cartesian products exist ===
Theorem:
If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are sets, then there is a set &quot;A&quot;×&quot;B&quot; which consists of all ordered pairs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) of elements &quot;a&quot; of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;B&quot;.

Proof:

The singleton set with member &quot;a&quot;, written {&quot;a&quot;}, is the same as the unordered pair {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;}, by the axiom of extensionality. 

The singleton, the set {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}, and then also the ordered pair
:formula_10
all exist by pairing.
A possible Δ0-formula formula_11 expressing that &quot;p&quot; stands for the pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is given by the lengthy
:formula_12
::formula_13
:::formula_14

What follows are two steps of collection of sets, followed by a restriction through separation. All results are also expressed using set builder notation.

Firstly, given formula_15 and collecting with respect to formula_16, some superset of formula_17 exists by collection.

The Δ0-formula 
:formula_18 
grants that just formula_19 itself exists by separation.

If formula_20 ought to stand for this collection of pairs formula_19, then a Δ0-formula characterizing it is
:formula_22
Given formula_16 and collecting with respect to formula_24, some superset of formula_25 exists by collection.

Putting formula_26 in front of that last formula and one finds the set formula_25 itself exists by separation.

Finally, the desired
:formula_28
exists by union.
Q.E.D.

== Metalogic ==
The proof-theoretic ordinal of KPω is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal. KP fails to prove some common theorems in set theory, such as the Mostowski collapse lemma.

<text>The long hundred, also known as the great hundred or twelfty, is the number 120 (in base-10 Hindu-Arabic numerals) that was referred to as &quot;hund,&quot; &quot;hund-teontig,&quot; &quot;hundrað&quot;, &quot;hundrath&quot;, or &quot;hundred&quot; in Germanic languages prior to the 15th century, and is now known as &quot;one hundred&quot; (&quot;and&quot;) &quot;twenty&quot;, or &quot;six score&quot;. The number was translated into Latin in Germanic-speaking countries as (Roman numeral C), but the qualifier &quot;long&quot; is now added because English now uses &quot;hundred&quot; exclusively to refer to the number of five score (100) instead.

The long hundred was 120, but the long thousand was reckoned decimally as 10 long hundreds (1200).

==English unit==
The hundred () was an English unit of measurement used in the production, sale and taxation of various items in the medieval kingdom of England. The value was often different from 100 units, mostly because of the continued medieval use of the Germanic long hundred of 120. The unit&#x27;s use as a measure of weight is now described as a hundredweight, i.e. 112 pounds.

The Latin edition of the Assize of Weights and Measures, one of the statutes of uncertain date from around 1300, describes hundreds of (red) herring (a long hundred of 120 fish), beeswax, sugar, pepper, cumin, and alum (&quot; stone, each stone containing 8 pounds&quot;, or 108 Tower lbs.), coarse and woven linen, hemp canvas (a long hundred of 120 ells), and iron or horseshoes and shillings (a short hundred of 100 pieces). Later versions used the Troy or the avoirdupois pound in their reckonings instead and included hundreds of fresh herrings (a short hundred of 100 fish), cinnamon, nutmegs ( stone of 8 lb), and garlic (&quot;15 ropes of 15 heads&quot;, or 225 heads).

==History==
The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of glosses such as &quot;tenty-wise&quot; and &quot;ten-count&quot; to denote that certain numbers are to be understood as decimal. Such glosses would not be expected where decimal counting was usual. In the Gothic Bible, some marginalia glosses a five hundred () in the text as being understood (&quot;tenty-wise&quot;). Similar words are known in most other Germanic languages. Old Norse counted large numbers in twelves of tens, with its words &quot;one hundred and eighty&quot; () meaning 200, &quot;two hundred&quot; () meaning 240 and &quot;thousand&quot; (, ) meaning 1200. The word to signify 100 (a &quot;short hundred&quot;) was originally (). The use of the long hundred in medieval England and Scotland is documented by Stevenson and Goodare although the latter notes that it was sometimes avoided by using numbers such as &quot;seven score&quot;. The Assize of Weights and Measures, one of England&#x27;s statutes of uncertain date from , shows both the short and long hundred in competing use. 

The hundred of kippers is formed by six score fish and the hundred of hemp canvas and linen cloth is formed by six score ells, but the hundred of pounds, to be used in measuring bulk goods, is five times twenty, and the hundred of fresh herring is five score fish. Within the original Latin text, the numeral c. is used for a value of 120: (&quot;And each such &#x27;hundred&#x27; contains six twenties.&quot;) Once the short hundred began coming into use, Old Norse referred to the long hundred as (), as opposed to the short ()&quot;.&quot;

Measuring by long hundreds declined as Arabic numerals, which require the uniform base 10, spread throughout Europe during and after the 14th century. In modern times, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s use of the long hundred system within &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; helped popularize the word &quot;&quot; in modern English, primarily as a colloquial word for an indefinitely large number.

<text>Riogordo is a small town and municipality of around 3,000 inhabitants in Málaga province in the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain. It is situated in the centre of the comarca of Axarquía that runs east and inland of Málaga as far as Nerja. It is located 40 kilometers from Málaga and 30 km from Vélez-Málaga. Nestled in the low-lying mountains (between the Montes de Málaga and the higher sierras), it is almost one of the classic Andalusian &quot;white villages&quot;. It is equidistant between Málaga and Vélez-Málaga, both of which are little more than 30 minutes by car.

The town hosts the &quot;El Paso&quot; festival at Easter (&quot;Semana Santa&quot;), a reenactment of the crucifixion which has a cast of hundreds, mostly local villagers.

<text>No Fun Aloud is the debut solo studio album by Glenn Frey. It was released in 1982 on Asylum.

The album reached #32 on the charts and contained two top 40 singles, &quot;The One You Love&quot; and &quot;I Found Somebody&quot;. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, selling over 500,000 (half a million) copies in the United States.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s Frey&#x27;s perfectly guided vocals and impeccable talent for crafting laid-back love songs that make[s] the album noteworthy ... With Frey&#x27;s own production assistance, &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot; stands up as a modest debut album.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; called &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot; &quot;a predictably slick solo debut in [Frey&#x27;s] old band&#x27;s party-boy mode.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it &quot;remarkably uninspired and joyless,&quot; writing that &quot;by and large, the songs are of the John David Souther school of no-melody dirge—the type of thing that gives California music a bad name.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed it &quot;an agreeable, well-crafted little record.&quot;

<text>&quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; is a song by the American singer James Brown. First recorded for the 1964 album &quot;Out of Sight&quot; and then released in an alternate take as a single in 1965 and included on the compilation album of the same name, it was his highest-charting song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and is arguably his best-known recording. In 2013, the 1965 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Description==
&quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; is a twelve-bar blues with a brass-heavy instrumental arrangement similar to James Brown&#x27;s previous hit, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot;. It also features the same emphasis &quot;on the one&quot; (i.e. the first beat of the measure) that characterizes Brown&#x27;s developing funk style. The lyrics have Brown exulting in how good he feels (&quot;nice, like sugar and spice&quot;) now that he has the one he loves, his vocals punctuated by screams and shouts. The song includes an alto sax solo by Maceo Parker.

==Precursors==
&quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; developed from an earlier Brown-penned song, &quot;I Found You&quot;, with a nearly identical melody and lyrics. &quot;I Found You&quot; had been recorded by Brown&#x27;s back-up singer Yvonne Fair and released as a single (King 5594) in 1962, with little success.

In 1964, Brown recorded an early version of &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; with a different arrangement, including a stuttering rhythm and prominent baritone sax line, under the title &quot;I Got You&quot;. This version appeared on the Smash Records album &quot;Out of Sight&quot; and in the 1965 film &quot;Ski Party&quot;, in which Brown and the Famous Flames appear and lip sync a performance of the song. The film was released on June 30, 1965. It was intended for a single release but was withdrawn due to a court order from King Records, with whom Brown was involved in a contract dispute.

==Recording==
In 1965, after visiting Criteria Studios in Miami and being impressed by the sound of the studio&#x27;s custom recording console, King Records owner Syd Nathan booked a recording session for Brown, during which he recorded the version of &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; released by the label as a single.

==Reception==
The song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on November 13, 1965 following an October release, and reached number three on December 18. Of Brown&#x27;s 91 hits to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; is Brown&#x27;s highest-charting song. The song remained at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythm and Blues Singles chart for six non-consecutive weeks, after his previous single, &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot;, held the number-one spot for eight weeks. Brown&#x27;s screams at the beginning and end of the song have been sampled a number of times for hip hop and dance songs. The song has also been covered many times by other performers, and is frequently played at sporting events. The song is played at the Zentralstadion whenever RB Leipzig scores a goal.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;rhythmic, funky ode about a real lucky guy who wants nothing more than to be near his gal.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; reached No. 21 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs in Rock and Roll&quot; and No. 75 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot;, one of only seven songs to make both lists. In 2004, &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; was ranked No. 78 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

<text>&quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, then performing as &quot;John Cougar.&quot; Described by critics as a &quot;love ballad&quot;, this song was released as the second single from Mellencamp&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;American Fool&quot;, and was chosen by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as one of the Songs of the Century. It spent four weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1982 and is Mellencamp&#x27;s most successful hit single.

==Background and production==
According to John Mellencamp, &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; was based on the 1962 Tennessee Williams film &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;. He said of recording the song: &quot;&#x27;Jack &amp; Diane&#x27; was a terrible record to make. When I play it on guitar by myself, it sounds great; but I could never get the band to play along with me. That&#x27;s why the arrangement&#x27;s so weird. Stopping and starting, it&#x27;s not very musical.&quot; Mellencamp has also stated that the clapping was used only to help keep time and was supposed to be removed in the final mix. However, he left the clapping in once he realized the song would not work without it.

In 2014, Mellencamp revealed that the song was originally about an interracial couple, where Jack was African American and not a football star, but the record company persuaded him to change it.

The song was recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, and was produced by Mellencamp and Don Gehman (with Gehman also engineering). Backing Mellencamp were guitarists/backing vocalists Mick Ronson, Mike Wanchic, Larry Crane, drummer Kenny Aronoff, bassist/backing vocalist Robert Frank and keyboardist Eric Rosser.

In 1982, producer and guitarist Mick Ronson worked with Mellencamp on his &quot;American Fool&quot; album, and in particular on &quot;Jack &amp; Diane.&quot; In a 2008 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Mellencamp recalled:
Mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song, as I&#x27;d thrown it on the junk heap. Ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the &quot;American Fool&quot; record for four or five weeks. All of a sudden, for &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot;, Mick said, &#x27;Johnny, you should put baby rattles on there.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;What the f*ck does put baby rattles on the record mean?&#x27; So he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part &#x27;let it rock, let it roll&#x27; as a choir-ish-type thing, which had never occurred to me. And that is the part everybody remembers on the song. It was Ronson&#x27;s idea.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;this shuffling pop &#x27;ditty&#x27;...has a certain power that hits to the heartland with a warm, descriptive storyline that’s both personal and universal.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;The hooks here are in the storyline, which traces a blue collar romance &#x27;in the heartland&#x27; where Cougar hails from, capped by taut guitar and percussion.&quot;

The 1982 music video featured Mellencamp and his then-wife, Victoria Granucci.

===Samples===
American singer-songwriter Jessica Simpson sampled this in her song &quot;I Think I&#x27;m in Love with You,&quot; the third single from her debut studio album &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; (1999).

In 2018, country singer Jake Owen sampled this as a tribute song titled &quot;I Was Jack (You Were Diane)&quot;, featured on his album &quot;Greetings from... Jake&quot;.

<text>Credenhill is a village and civil parish in Herefordshire, England. The population of this civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 2,271.

==History==

Credenhill village has had military connections since 80 BC, when Iron Age Celts constructed a hill fort and earthwork defence system commanding the surrounding area. The Romans founded the town of Magnis at what is now Kenchester, which was later abandoned during the withdrawal of Roman armies from Britain. In 428 AD Magnis was destroyed by a fire during raids by the Picts and Scots. The remains of the old fort was occupied by the Saxons in 480 AD. The Saxon chief Creoda occupied the fort in 540 AD, and &quot;Creoda&#x27;s Hill&quot; gave its name to Credenhill.

During the First World War, land in Credenhill was occupied by an army unit to store ammunition. In 1939 the land was requisitioned for defence and became RAF Hereford.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Breinton with a total ward population as at the 2011 Census of 3,612.

== Landmarks ==
There is an Iron Age hill fort half a mile north of Credenhill. Archaeological finds are in Hereford Museum. The defences of this very large hill fort follow the 600 ft contour and enclose nearly 50 acres (200,000 m2). They comprise an embankment and ditch with a slight counter-scarp bank. There are traces of a quarry ditch inside the main rampart around most of the circuit. Original in-turned entrances are at the centre of the east side and at the south-east corner, each approached by a hollow way cut deeply into the hillside.

Trial excavation has shown that the internal quarry-ditch is 5–10 ft deep. Its gradual in-filling was found to include various occupation layers associated with rectangular wooden buildings with four corner posts, measuring about 12 x , which had been rebuilt several times in the same place. There were also storage pits and other remains of occupation including pottery with stamped and incised patterns typical of the West Midlands Iron Age. Date, c. 400 BC; occupied continuously until about 75 AD. The fort and the surrounding ancient woodland are now part of the Woodland Trust.

The 12th-century church of St Mary is a grade I listed building.

Near Credenhill is the site of the former Royal Air Force station, RAF Credenhill. It was redeveloped by the British Army for new headquarters for the 22 Special Air Service Regiment, who moved out in 1999. The following year, the base was garrisoned as Stirling Lines.

==Notable people==
*Credenhill has links to cider production, one of Herefordshire&#x27;s key industries. In 1887 Percy Bulmer founded the Bulmers cider company. The then 20-year-old son of the Reverend Charles Bulmer (rector of Credenhill) used apples from the rectory garden for the company&#x27;s first produce.
*Thomas Traherne, the 17th-century English poet and religious writer, was rector of Credenhill for ten years.

<text>&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; is a rock and roll song recorded by American singer Elvis Presley for the film of the same name. It was written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. RCA Victor released the song on a 45 rpm single on September 24, 1957, as the first single from the film&#x27;s soundtrack EP. It reached the top of the charts in the U.S. and the top 10 in several other countries. The song has been recognized by the Grammy Hall of Fame, the American Film Institute, and others.

==Characters and themes==
Some of the characters named in the song are real people. Shifty Henry was a well-known Los Angeles musician, not a criminal. The Purple Gang was a real mob. &quot;Sad Sack&quot; was a U.S. Army nickname in World War II for a loser, which was also the name of a popular comic strip and comic book character.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller&#x27;s &quot;theme song for Presley&#x27;s third movie was decidedly silly, the kind of tongue-in-cheek goof they had come up with for The Coasters. Presley, however, sang it as straight rock &amp; roll, overlooking the jokes in the lyrics (like the suggestion of gay romance when inmate Number 47 tells Number 3, &#x27;You&#x27;re the cutest jailbird I ever did see&#x27;) and then introducing Scotty Moore&#x27;s guitar solo with a cry so intense that the take almost collapses.&quot; Gender studies scholars cite the song for &quot;its famous reference to homoerotics behind bars,&quot; while music critic Garry Mulholland writes, &quot;&#x27;Jailhouse Rock&#x27; was always a queer lyric, in both senses.&quot; Douglas Brode writes of the filmed production number that it&#x27;s &quot;amazing that the sequence passed by the censors&quot;.

==Releases and chart performance==
The single, with its B-side &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot; (another song from the film&#x27;s soundtrack) was a US number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for seven weeks in the fall of 1957, and a UK number one hit for three weeks early in 1958. In addition, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; spent one week at the top of the US country charts, and reached the number one position on the R&amp;B charts.

Also in 1957, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; was the lead song in an EP (extended play single) titled &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, together with other songs from the film, namely &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot;, &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot; and &quot;(You&#x27;re So Square) Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; (but with &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot; omitted). It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; EP charts, ultimately selling two million copies and earning a double-platinum RIAA certification.

In 2004, it finished at number 21 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. On November 27, 2016, the Grammy Hall of Fame announced its induction, along with that of another 24 songs. In 2019, the song ranked number 31 on Spanish radio station Rock FM 500&#x27;s list of &quot;Five Hundred Rockers of All Time&quot;, ahead of any other song of the 1950s.

<doc id="1124724" wikidata="Q2337709" url="?curid=1124724" title="You Shook Me All Night Long">
<text>&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; is a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, from the album &quot;Back in Black&quot;. The song also reappeared on their later album &quot;Who Made Who&quot;. It is AC/DC&#x27;s first single with Brian Johnson as the lead singer, replacing Bon Scott who died of alcohol poisoning in February 1980. It reached number 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album &quot;Who Made Who&quot;. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. &quot;She&#x27;s Got Balls&quot; (Live, Bondi Lifesaver &#x27;77); B2. &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; (Live &#x27;83 – 12-inch maxi-single only).

In January 2018, as part of Triple M&#x27;s &quot;Ozzest 100&quot;, the &quot;most Australian&quot; songs of all time, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; was ranked number 63.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Record World&quot; said it has &quot;a truckload of gravel and enough raunch to satisfy a stadium-size crowd,&quot; as well as &quot;havoc wrecking guitar blasts.&quot;

&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; placed at number 10 on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s&quot;. It was also number 1 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten AC/DC Songs&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; at number 80 on their &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; list. In 2021, it was ranked at No. 287 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot;

Rock critic Robert Christgau regarded it as a &quot;drum-hooked fucksong&quot; and the band&#x27;s &quot;only great work of art&quot;.

==Live versions==
The song has also become a staple of AC/DC concerts, and is rarely excluded from the setlist.

Four live versions of the song were officially released. The first one appeared on the 1986 maxi-single &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;; the second one was included on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Live&quot;; the third version is on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern movie &quot;Private Parts&quot;, and also appears on the AC/DC box set &quot;Backtracks&quot;; and the fourth one is on the band&#x27;s live album, &quot;Live at River Plate&quot;.

&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; was also the second song to be played by AC/DC on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2000, following their performance of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip.&quot; When AC/DC was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, they performed this song with Tyler.

Johnson performed the song with Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden in New York in March 2014. The &quot;Salon&quot; publication stated on the following morning in its introduction to the video footage of the performance: &quot;This will either be your favorite video today, or a total musical nightmare!&quot;

At one of his two shows at St James&#x27; Park in June 2023, Sam Fender brought Johnson on stage to perform &quot;Back in Black&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; with him.

== Composition ==

The song is in the key of G major. The main verse and riff follows a G–C–D chord progression.

== Controversy ==
There have been several claims made since it was released that (at least) some parts of the lyrics to the song were written by Bon Scott.

Silver Smith, late former girlfriend of Bon Scott, interviewed by Jesse Fink for his biography of Scott, &quot;Bon: The Last Highway&quot;, said: &quot;I know for sure that [the song] was written at [my flat in] Gloucester Road [in Kensington, London] back in &#x27;76. &#x27;She told me to come but I was already there&#x27; – he wrote that in a letter to somebody, one of his grotty mates, just after we got together, actually. He always kept notebooks and added and subtracted to them and so on. He put in &#x27;American thighs&#x27; even way back then, because that was the market they were going to try and crack. So that was written a long time ago.&quot; In the same book, Scott&#x27;s girlfriend in Miami, Florida, a woman under the pseudonym &quot;Holly X&quot;, says the original lyric &quot;chartreuse eyes&quot; was changed to &quot;sightless eyes&quot; and that she had a horse called Doubletime. The lyrics &quot;working double time on the seduction line&quot; appear in the finished song.

Doug Thaler, Bon&#x27;s friend and AC/DC&#x27;s booking agent on their American tours, also says: &quot;I don&#x27;t care who tells me anything different: you can bet your life that Bon Scott wrote the lyrics to &#x27;You Shook Me All Night Long&#x27;. It&#x27;s Bon Scott&#x27;s lyrics all over the place.&quot;

From &quot;AC/DC: Hell Ain&#x27;t a Bad Place to Be&quot; by Mick Wall: &quot;However Malcolm Dome claims that shortly before he died, Bon &#x27;shoved me his book of lyrics. He had sheets of lyrics that he kept in a file, carried them around. He&#x27;d been showing me some of the ideas he&#x27;d been working for Back in Black. Not the song &#x27;Back in Black&#x27; but songs that were for the next album. There were a couple of lines, like, &#x27;She told me to come but I was already there&#x27;, which ended up in &#x27;You Shook Me All Night Long&#x27; – that&#x27;s a Bon lyric. And I saw it. I saw it written down. There were lyrics, lines used, on Back in Black that Bon wrote. [But] he wasn&#x27;t credited and to this day no one&#x27;s really sure what happened. I don&#x27;t think he even got close to finishing the whole songs. But there are lines in there that I know.&quot;

Dome also stated &quot;Bon proudly showed me some of the scribbles he&#x27;d put down in preparation for an album he felt would define AC/DC – and open up new possibilities as well. It&#x27;s hard to be absolutely accurate from a distance of quarter of a century, and through the haze of alcohol which enveloped the night, but one line sticks in my mind as being on one of those sheets: &#x27;She told me to come, but I was already there.&#x27; A renowned lyric from the song &#x27;You Shook Me All Night Long&#x27;, it has Bon&#x27;s trademark all over it – a neatly worked double entendre that fits in with the track record of a man who wrote Big Balls, The Jack and other similarly styled songs.&quot;

== Music video ==
There are two music videos. The first is directed by Eric Dionysius and Eric Mistler, is similar to the other &quot;Back in Black&quot; videos (&quot;Back in Black&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, &quot;What Do You Do For Money Honey&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Ain&#x27;t Noise Pollution&quot; and &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot;) and is available on the special &quot;Back in Black, The Videos&quot;. It is also included on the &quot;Backtracks&quot; box set.

The second is directed by David Mallet and released six years after the song&#x27;s original release (when the song was reissued in &quot;Who Made Who&quot;). Angus and Malcolm Young follow Johnson around the West Riding of Yorkshire town of Huddersfield, with Angus Young wearing his signature schoolboy outfit. The video clip casts the English glamour model Corinne Russell, a former Hill&#x27;s Angel and Page 3 Girl—along with other leather clad women wearing suits with zips at the groin region—pedaling exercise bicycles in the background.

The VH1 series &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot; revealed that, during the scene with the mechanical bull, the woman playing Johnson&#x27;s lover accidentally jabbed herself with her spur twice. The roadie who came to her aid married her a year later, and Angus Young gave them a mechanical bull as a wedding present as a joke. In the original 1980 video Phil Rudd played drums, while the 1986 video showed Simon Wright, who replaced Rudd in 1983. Rudd returned to AC/DC in 1994.

<doc id="1124728" wikidata="Q366067" url="?curid=1124728" title="Cotterstock">
<text>Cotterstock is a village and civil parish in North Northamptonshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 153.

==Geography==
Cotterstock is on the banks of the River Nene, which flows through the city of Peterborough to the north east and empties into the North Sea in The Wash. The nearest larger town is Oundle to the south west.

==History==
Cotterstock was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Codestoche&quot;, the name probably deriving from Old English &quot;corther-stoc&quot; (dairy farm).

In the summer of 1736 a Romano-British villa was discovered when tesserae from a large mosaic pavement were uncovered during ploughing. The villa was subsequently located a second time by aerial photography during the extremely dry summer of 1976, when parch marks of buried walls were recorded spread across three fields. A geophysical survey undertaken to accurately locate and amplify the aerial photographic information was carried out over a total of ten days in 1992 and 1993. A total of 19,140 soil resistance values were recorded at one-metre intervals within a grid composed of 20-metre squares.

The Church of St Andrew is located to the east of the village, adjacent to the River Nene; it dates from the late 12th century. The main period of construction was in the 13th and 14th centuries and the building was restored and extended in 1876. Cotterstock Hall was built in 1658 with alterations in the early 18th century and a main staircase added in the 19th century. The poet and playwright John Dryden was a frequent visitor and is thought to have stayed in the south-west attic room at the Hall, visiting relatives, the last of whom, Rev Sir George Booth, died in 1797. The house was later purchased by Jane Fane, Countess of Westmorland, who died there in 1857.

Also of interest is the &quot;Old Mill&quot; which was built during the early 19th century. Cotterstock parish contains 20 entries on the statutory list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest, 16 of which are within the Conservation Area covering the eastern part of the village around St Andrew&#x27;s Church and Cotterstock Hall. Tree Preservation Orders have been made on trees in and around the village.
Cotterstock was the birthplace of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada from 1791 to 1796 and founder of Toronto, who was born here on 25 February 1752.

== Infrastructure ==
The village consists of a single street with Cotterstock Hall located in the centre and St Andrew&#x27;s Church in the east. Cotterstock has a village hall.

== In the media ==
In 2010, Cotterstock Hall was used as a film set for &#x27;The Woman in Black&#x27;. Star Daniel Radcliffe said of the Hall: &quot;Cotterstock Hall is a remarkable building bursting with Gothic grandeur – perfect for The Woman In Black&quot;.

<text>Carlson is an American privately held company headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States. Its primary subsidiary is Carlson Private Capital Partners, a family office that manages the owners&#x27; wealth. It previously held interests in hotels, including Radisson Hotels, and restaurants, including TGI Fridays. The company is owned by Barbara Carlson Gage and Marilyn Carlson Nelson, daughters of the founder, Curt Carlson.

==History==
===1938-1961; foundation as Gold Bond Stamp Company===
Curt Carlson founded Carlson in 1938. It was originally named the Gold Bond Stamp Company and started with a $55 loan Carlson received from his landlord during the Great Depression. Carlson used &quot;Gold Bond Stamps&quot;, a loyalty program based on trading stamps, to provide consumer incentives for grocery stores, supermarkets, and gas stations. The stamps could be redeemed for various items, such as patio furniture or a mink coat. During the 1950s, C. F. Carlson was the nation&#x27;s largest supplier of mink coats.

===1962-2013; Expansion into hospitality industry===

In 1962, Carlson bought into his first Radisson Hotel, a vintage property in Minneapolis named after French explorer Pierre-Esprit Radisson. The chain grew rapidly by franchising the name and taking management contracts for new hotels throughout the country. The company was renamed Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973.

In 1975, Carlson ventured into the restaurant business by acquiring an interest in TGI Fridays, taking full ownership in 1989. It also purchased Country Kitchen, a chain of family-style restaurants in 1977, selling the brand in 1997.

In 1981, Carlson acquired E.F. MacDonald Motivation Co., another incentive management company, making the company the largest trading stamp company in the world. At that time, many employees were working six days per week and not receiving higher pay than those at similar companies with less demands. In 1986, the company also established the Country Inns &amp; Suites brand.

In 1994, Carlson and Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, a division of Accor, merged their travel agencies to form CWT, a travel management company. In 1997, Carlson acquired Regent Hotels &amp; Resorts from Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. Carlson gained the rights to develop future hotels, while Four Seasons maintained management of nine hotels. In spring 1998, Curt Carlson named his daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson as his successor. He died in February 1999 after suffering a stroke. In 2000, the company acquired Park Inn by Radisson and Park Plaza Hotels &amp; Resorts.

In 2005, Carlson acquired 25% of Rezidor Hotel Group, a business partner of the hotel division in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) markets. Rezidor became a subsidiary of the Carlson hotel group in 2010, despite retaining its listing status. The hotel group rebranded as Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group in January 2012.

===2013 to present; divesting and foundation of family office===

In May 2013, Diana Nelson assumed the chairmanship of the board of directors, succeeding her mother, Marilyn Carlson Nelson, who continues to serve as chairman emeritus. Rautio retired in 2015, leading to the company having separate CEOs for the hotel and travel businesses until the hotel business was sold to HNA.

The company sold TGI Fridays to Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners for a reported $800 million in 2014. Two years later, it sold its hotel division, including Rezidor Hotel Group, Country Inns &amp; Suites by Carlson, Park Inn by Radisson, Park Plaza Hotels &amp; Resorts, Radisson Hotels, Radisson Blu Hotels, and Radisson Red Hotels, to the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The division was renamed Radisson Hotel Group in 2018.

In 2018, the company launched a family office to invest its cash. It also renovated its headquarters.

In 2022, CWT received a capital injection from owners which resulted in Carlson moving from majority to minority ownership.

Aug. 11, 2022 Choice Hotels International, Inc. announced that it has completed the acquisition of the franchise business, operations and intellectual property of Radisson Hotels Americas for approximately $675 million from Radisson Hotel Group, inclusive of the real estate value of three owned hotels.

<doc id="1124731" wikidata="Q7713192" url="?curid=1124731" title="The Allnighter (album)">
<text>The Allnighter is the second solo studio album by Glenn Frey, the guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. The album was released in mid-1984 on MCA in the United States and the United Kingdom, two years after Frey&#x27;s modestly successful debut album &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot; and four years after the demise of the Eagles. It was and still is Frey&#x27;s most successful solo album throughout his whole solo career, having reached No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and releasing two top 20 singles with &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. The album achieved gold status by the RIAA in the US. It is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Frey&#x27;s solo work.

The single &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot; helped to inspire the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode of the same name, and Frey was invited to star in that episode, which was Frey&#x27;s acting debut. The music video for the single also won Frey an MTV Video Music Award in 1985.

==Composition==
When Frey was asked about his song writing partnership with Jack Tempchin, he said at the time that &quot;It&#x27;s funny, there are only those certain people where things click — at least for me. He&#x27;s very free. I&#x27;ll just run some soul licks by him, or I&#x27;ll ring him something like &quot;The Allnighter,&quot; which originally was just about staying up all night. But then we started talking about it and Jack says, ‘Staying up all night can&#x27;t play over three or four verses. What if the Allnighter was a guy?’ So, we made him into some woman&#x27;s every-guy.&quot; The lyrics of &quot;Better in the U.S.A&quot; are opposed to the Soviet Union.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau gave &quot;The Alnighter&quot; a &quot;C&quot; and panned it as a &quot;smarmy piece of sexist pseudosoul&quot;. In a retrospective review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), Mark Coleman gave the album two out of five stars and wrote that it &quot;glistens with synthesized oomph, but the sugar coating doesn&#x27;t sit well on Frey&#x27;s mannered white R&amp;B loverman act.&quot; On the other hand, AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann retrospectively gave it four-and-a-half stars and said that it departs from the &quot;old Eagles sound&quot; of Frey&#x27;s last album for a &quot;bluesy, rocking feel.&quot;

<text>was a Japanese actor, voice actor, narrator and theatre director from Katsuyama, Fukui. He was affiliated with Aoni Production at the time of his death and was known for providing the voice of both the narrator and Professor Oak/Dr. Yukinari Okido on the Japanese anime series &quot;Pokémon&quot;. In addition to that, he regularly appeared in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, voicing Onix, Steelix and numerous other Pokémon.

Ishizuka was known for his deep, strong voice and was often cast in the role of older mature male characters, such as Jet Black from &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Eugene Gallardo from &quot;Tales of Rebirth&quot; and Captain Matthews in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; trilogy. He was also the Japanese dub voice of Captain Gantu in every version of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; to date. He was also the fourth Japanese voice of Heihachi Mishima in the &quot;Tekken&quot; video game series, and the second Japanese voice for Mr. Satan in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, taking over both roles since the death of longtime actor Daisuke Gōri. He has voiced the roles of Kizaru in the &quot;One Piece&quot; series, Van Hohenheim in the &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot; series, Zabuza Momochi in the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, Ginzo Nakamori in &quot;Detective Conan&quot; and &quot;Magic Kaito&quot;, Joseph Joestar in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders&quot; and &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;, as well as Bunta Fujiwara in &quot;Initial D&quot;, Ryotaro Dojima in &quot;Persona 4&quot; and Ujiyasu Hōjō in &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;.

<text>Cyberkinetics is an American company with roots tied to the University of Utah. It was co-founded by John Donoghue, Mijail Serruya, Gerhard Friehs of Brown University, and Nicho Hatsopoulos of the University of Chicago. The Braingate technology and related Cyberkinetic’s assets were sold to Blackrock Neurotech (then Blackrock Microsystems) and BrainGate Inc. in 2008. 

==Funding==
Scientists behind the project used $9.3 million in first round funding led by Oxford Bioscience Partners. A 2002 merger with Bionic Technologies, co-founded by Brian Hatt and Richard A. Normann (the inventor of the Utah array) added to a tech team armed with intellectual property rights gained from Brown, MIT, and others. They say they&#x27;re three to five years away from putting a product on the market.

According to their latest SEC filing, the Founders of the company resigned from the Board of Directors at the end of October 2008.

==Merger and renaming==

In late 2004, Cyberkinetics initiated a reverse merger with a Texas company in order to gain access to the public market. The resulting company was renamed &quot;Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems, Inc.&quot; and its shares are listed under the symbol CYKN.OB. In 2009, the BrainGate business and related Cyberkinetic assets were sold to privately held Braingate, Inc. In the same year, Cyberkinetics was acquired by Blackrock Microsystems, LLC. The acquisition included a small team and ownership of neurophysiological recording devices. 

==Clinical trials==
Since July 8, 2009, clinical trials are being conducted for the Brain Gate 2 Neural Interface System. Since July 16, 2009, the pilot clinical trial of the BrainGate2 Neural Interface System is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

<text>Pilton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated on the A361 road in the Mendip district, 3 miles (5 km) south-west of Shepton Mallet and 6 miles (10 km) east of Glastonbury. The village has a population of 998. The parish includes the hamlets of West Compton, East Compton, Westholme, Beardly Batch and Cannards Grave.

==History==
Pilton is now almost from the sea but sits on the edge of the Somerset Levels, an area which has now been drained but was once a shallow tidal lake. According to legend in the 1st century, being a landing place then known as Pooltown, it is where Joseph of Arimathea landed in Britain .

The parish of Pilton was part of the Whitstone Hundred.

Cannard&#x27;s Grave is located on the southern edge of Shepton Mallet. Local legend (of which there are several versions) says that, in the 17th century, the publican of the local inn, Giles Cannard (possibly also known as Tom the Taverner), engaged in criminal activity such as robbing, or aiding and abetting the robbery of, his guests, theft, smuggling and possibly forgery. His activities having been discovered, he either committed suicide or was convicted and hanged from the gibbet at the adjacent crossroads and buried nearby. Other explanations of the name include a tale that Kenred a pagan and uncle of King Ine who converted to Christianity was buried there. Perhaps the most likely story is that a thief convicted of sheep stealing was tried and hanged at the site.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of the Wells and Mendip Hills county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Church==

The present Medieval village church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, may stand on the site of an earlier wattle and daub church built by the early missionaries. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

==Listed buildings==

The village has a Grade II* listed manor house and a Grade I listed tithe barn, which belonged to Glastonbury Abbey.

==Culture==
Pilton is famous as the location of the Glastonbury Festival, which is run by Pilton farmer Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily Eavis. All villagers get a free ticket.

<doc id="1124749" wikidata="Q644416" url="?curid=1124749" title="London Calling (song)">
<text>&quot;London Calling&quot; is a song by the British punk rock band the Clash. It was released as a single from the band&#x27;s 1979 double album of the same name. This apocalyptic, politically charged rant features the band&#x27;s post-punk sound, electric guitar and vocals.

==Writing and recording==
The song was written by Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. The title alludes to the BBC World Service&#x27;s station identification: &quot;This is London calling ...&quot;, which was used during World War II, often in broadcasts to occupied countries.

The lyrics reflect the concern felt by Strummer about world events with the reference to &quot;a nuclear error&quot; – the incident at Three Mile Island, which occurred earlier in 1979. Joe Strummer has said: &quot;We felt that we were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.&quot;

The line &quot;London is drowning / And I live by the river&quot; comes from concerns that if the River Thames flooded, most of central London would drown, something that led to the construction of the Thames Barrier. Strummer references police brutality in the lines &quot;We ain&#x27;t got no swing / Except for the ring of that truncheon thing&quot; as the Metropolitan Police at the time had a truncheon as standard issued equipment.

The lyrics also reflect desperation of the Clash&#x27;s situation in 1979 struggling with high debt, without management and arguing with their record label CBS over whether the &quot;London Calling&quot; album should be a single or double album. The lines referring to &quot;Now don&#x27;t look to us / Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust&quot; reflects the concerns of the band over its situation after the punk rock boom in England had ended in 1977.

According to a retrospective assessment by AllMusic critic Donald A. Guarisco, the song &quot;cleverly crossbreeds anthemic hard rock with reggae by juxtaposing slashing, staccato guitar riffs with an undulating rhythm section beat as Strummer lays down a snarling vocal&quot;. Guarisco finds that this gives the song &quot;a hypnotic sense of drive.&quot;

The song fades out with a Morse code signal spelling S-O-S, reiterating the earlier urgent sense of emergency, and further alluding to drowning in the river.

&quot;London Calling&quot; was recorded at Wessex Studios located in a former church hall in Highbury in North London. This studio had already proved to be a popular location with the Sex Pistols, the Pretenders and the Tom Robinson Band. The single was produced by Guy Stevens and engineered by Bill Price.

==Artwork==
Continuing the theme of the retro Elvis Presley-inspired &quot;London Calling&quot; LP cover, the single sleeve (front and back) is based on old Columbia 78 rpm sleeves. The cover artwork was designed by Ray Lowry and is identical to the Columbia sleeve but with the blank 78 covers from the original changed to classic rock and punk LP sleeves. From left to right they are, the Beatles&#x27; debut &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, the Rolling Stones″ debut album &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, the Clash&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Clash&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and Presley&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;Elvis Presley&quot;.

==Reissues==
The single has several issues, all with different covers. Four are from 1979 (catalogue number: 8087; S CBS 8087; 128087; S CBS 8087). In 1988, a special limited edition boxed set was released, containing three tracks, &quot;London Calling&quot; on side one, &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; and &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot; on side two, a poster and two badges (catalogue number: CLASH B2). Two were released by CBS Records in 1991 (catalogue number: 656946; 31-656946-22) both with &quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; on the B-side, the second one has an additional track on side two &quot;Return to Brixton (Jeremy Healy 7&quot; Remix)&quot; (see the table below).

In 2012, on the occasion of the International Record Store Day, a limited edition 7&quot; was released, with a new mix of the song by Mick Jones, and an instrumental version on the B-side.


==Chart success and critical reception==
&quot;London Calling&quot; was released as the only single from the album in the UK and reached No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1980, becoming at once the band&#x27;s highest-charting single until &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; hit No. 1 ten years later. The song did not make the U.S. charts, as &quot;Train in Vain&quot; was released as a single and broke the band in the United States, reaching No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Nightingale made a bet with Strummer that &quot;London Calling&quot; would make the UK Top 10 without them appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the stake being a Cadillac (&quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot; being the second track on the &quot;London Calling&quot; album). When the record peaked at number 11, Nightingale was saved by a listener who donated a Cadillac. The Cadillac was subsequently auctioned to raise funds for the recession-hit steel town of Corby.

&quot;London Calling&quot; was the first Clash song to chart elsewhere in the world, reaching the top 40 in Australia. The success of the single and album was greatly helped by the music video shot by Don Letts showing the band playing the song on a boat at Festival Pier, next to Albert Bridge on the south side of the Thames, Battersea Park in a cold and rainy night at the beginning of December 1979.

The single fell off the charts after 10 weeks, but later re-entered the chart twice, spending a total of 15 non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart.

Over the years, &quot;London Calling&quot; has become regarded by various critics as the band&#x27;s finest song. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 15 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; in the 2021 update, the song was re-ranked at number 143. In 2011, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 18 greatest songs by the Clash. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 40 greatest songs by the Clash. It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

In 2007, the 1979 recording of &quot;London Calling&quot; by the Clash on Epic Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Notable appearances and covers==
The Clash turned down a request from British Telecom to use the song for an advertising campaign in the early 1990s. In 2002, the Clash incurred criticism from some fans of the band when they sold the rights to Jaguar for a car advertisement.

The song was used for a 2012 British Airways advertisement, picturing a jet aeroplane taxiing through the streets of London passing numerous landmarks and parking outside the Olympic Stadium.

Joe Strummer later became a DJ for the BBC World Service, on a programme called &quot;Joe Strummer&#x27;s London Calling&quot;.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Clash gave permission to a Ukrainian punk band named Beton to rewrite the song as an anti-invasion anthem and charity fundraiser titled &quot;Kyiv Calling&quot;.

<text>In particle physics, a truly neutral particle is a subatomic particle that is its own antiparticle. In other words, it remains itself under the charge conjugation, which replaces particles with their corresponding antiparticles. All charges of a &quot;truly neutral particle&quot; must be equal to zero. This requires particles to not only be electrically neutral, but also requires that all of their other charges (such as the colour charge) be neutral.

==Examples==
Known examples of such elementary particles include photons, Z bosons, and Higgs bosons, along with the hypothetical neutralinos, sterile neutrinos, and gravitons. For a spin-½ particle such as the neutralino, being &quot;truly neutral&quot; implies being a Majorana fermion.

Composite particles can also be truly neutral. A system composed of a particle forming a bound state with its antiparticle, such as the neutral pion (), is &quot;truly neutral&quot;. Such a state is called an &quot;onium&quot;, another example of which is positronium, the bound state of an electron and a positron ( ).

By way of contrast, neutrinos are not &quot;truly neutral&quot; since they have a weak isospin of , or equivalently, a non-zero weak hypercharge, both of which are charge-like quantum numbers. (The example presumes on evidence to date, which gives no indication that neutrinos are Majorana particles.)

<doc id="1124755" wikidata="Q7564295" url="?curid=1124755" title="Soul Searchin' (Glenn Frey album)">
<text>Soul Searchin&#x27; is the third solo studio album by Glenn Frey, the guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. The album was released on August 15, 1988 on MCA in the United States and the United Kingdom, four years after Frey&#x27;s successful album, &quot;The Allnighter&quot; and eight years after the demise of the Eagles. The album features eight original songs co-written by Frey with Jack Tempchin and the song &quot;Two Hearts&quot; contributed by Frey&#x27;s friend, Hawk Wolinski. The album also features contributions from fellow Eagles member Timothy B. Schmit, Max Carl, Robbie Buchanan, Michael Landau, and Bruce Gaitsch.

The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. It was also not as successful as Frey&#x27;s previous albums (although one of his favorites), peaking at #36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which marked the beginning of a downturn in Frey&#x27;s fortunes on the album charts. The album&#x27;s first and leading single, &quot;True Love&quot;, unlike the album, was a commercial success, peaking at #13 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 and #2 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and so was the second single, the title track which peaked at #5 also on the same chart, while next single &quot;Livin&#x27; Right&quot; was #90 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100.

==Background==

Frey began work on the album in the midst of a string of hits in the 1980s, as well as animosity between him and other members of the Eagles. The album&#x27;s title refers to his efforts to find his own identity.

==Musical direction==
When Frey was asked about his musical direction, he said &quot;In a sense I&#x27;m working my way back home, Though I left Detroit and went to California to cut my teeth on country-rock, I&#x27;ve remained obsessed with the music of my adolescence, the great soul hits of the 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a style that most black musicians have abandoned for dance music and rap. There are a whole lot of people who miss the sound of Sam &amp; Dave, and Wilson Pickett. It&#x27;s left a gap that is being filled by people like Steve Winwood.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann wrote of the album &quot;the songs here were so interchangeable with those on his first two albums he apologized for it in his note about &quot;True Love,&quot; which became the album&#x27;s sole Top 40 hit. The music was pleasant, but inconsequential, and suggested that Frey, living off his Eagles royalties, had come to think of his solo career as a hobby.&quot; In a review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), Mark Coleman gave the album one and a half out of five stars and wrote that &quot;Frey sounded like he wasn&#x27;t even trying anymore; his pump-your-body TV gym commercials at the time displayed more sweat and effort&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs by Glenn Frey and Jack Tempchin, except where noted.
B-side &quot;It&#x27;s Cold in Here&quot;, written with Cameron, and the following year&#x27;s &quot;Flip City&quot;, written with Wolinski, were later released as bonus tracks on reissues of the album.

<text>Sir Wilson James Whineray (10 July 1935 – 22 October 2012) was a New Zealand business executive and rugby union player. He was the longest-serving captain of the national rugby union team, the All Blacks, until surpassed by Richie McCaw in 2014. Rugby writer Terry McLean considered him the All Blacks&#x27; greatest captain.

==Domestic career==
Owing to his early career as an agricultural cadet, which involved considerable travel around the country, Whineray played for six first-class teams, including Wairarapa, Mid Canterbury, Manawatu, Canterbury, Waikato, and finally his hometown team, Auckland, for whom he made 61 appearances between 1959 and 1966. He also played for the South Island, North Island, and New Zealand Universities sides.

==International career==
He first played for the All Blacks in 1957. The following year he became captain for the 1958 series against Australia at the young age of 23. He went on to play 77 matches for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1965, 67 of them as captain. These included 32 test matches, all but two of them as captain. He played mostly in the position of prop. Whineray was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for services to sport, especially to rugby football, in the 1962 New Year Honours, and he was named New Zealand Sportsperson of the Year in 1965.

==Later life==

After retiring from rugby, he gained an MBA from Harvard University, where he was a member of the Harvard Business School RFC. He returned to New Zealand in 1969 and started work at Alex Harvey Industries, which became Carter Holt Harvey. He rose to become deputy managing director, then chairman of the board of Carter Holt Harvey, by then a major New Zealand company, and retired from the board in 2003. He was the managing director of NZ Wool Marketing Corporation in 1973–74, chairman of the National Bank of New Zealand, and a director of Auckland International Airport and APN News &amp; Media.

He was chairman of the Hillary Commission, a sports funding body, from 1993 to 1998. He was the honorary Colonel Commandant of the New Zealand Special Air Service from 1997 to 2001.

In the 1998 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Whineray was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM), for services to sport and business management. In 2003, he was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

In November 2004, it was reported that Whineray was a top contender to replace Dame Silvia Cartwright as Governor-General in 2006. Bob Howitt has said that, &quot;had he allowed his name to go forward, he would have become the Governor-General&quot;. He became the first New Zealander inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, being elected on 21 October 2007 (following the IRB World Cup in France) after a public vote.

Whineray died in Auckland in 2012, at the age of 77. He was buried at Purewa Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Meadowbank.

<text>The Saint Lucia national football team represents Saint Lucia in men&#x27;s international football and is administered by the Saint Lucia Football Association, the governing body for football in Saint Lucia. They have been a member of FIFA since 1988 and a member of CONCACAF since 1986. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==
The team attempted to qualify to the World Cup finals tournament for the first time during the 1994 World Cup qualification, when they were eliminated in the first qualification round by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 1992.

In the CONCACAF 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification Saint Lucia played Aruba in the first qualifying round – losing the first leg 4–2 in Aruba. The return leg in Saint Lucia ended in a 4–2 victory after 90 minutes, sending the tie into extra time, and then to penalty kicks. Saint Lucia won the shoot-out 5–4 and advanced to the main draw for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Saint Lucia were then grouped with Canada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Puerto Rico in Group D of the second qualifying round. Saint Lucia were eliminated from World Cup qualification after finishing last in their group with one point as a result of one draw and five losses. 
In 2014 the team won the Windward Islands Tournament after beating Dominica 2–0, Grenada 1–0 and a tie with Saint Vincent &amp; The Grenadines.

The Saint Lucia FA established a partnership with England&#x27;s Carlisle United which saw four Saint Lucians trial at the club each year from 2012 in exchange for Carlisle getting right of first refusal for the players&#x27; professional rights.

FIFA announced that Saint Lucia withdrew from the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification before their first match, after they were initially drawn into Group E in the first round.

<doc id="1124761" wikidata="Q1631268" url="?curid=1124761" title="Roxanne (The Police song)">
<text>&quot;Roxanne&quot; is a song by British rock band the Police. The song was written by lead singer and bassist Sting and was released as a single on 7 April 1978, in advance of their debut album &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, released on 3 November. It was written from the point of view of a man who falls in love with a prostitute. When re-released on 12 April 1979, the song peaked at on the UK Singles Chart.

The song ranked No. 388 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; and was voted No. 85 by VH1 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot;.

&quot;Roxanne&quot; was first song the band performed live at the 2007 Grammy Awards to kick off their 30th Anniversary Reunion Tour. In 2008, &quot;Roxanne&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Police lead singer Sting wrote the song inspired by the prostitutes he saw near the band&#x27;s seedy hotel in Paris, France, where the Police were lodged in October 1977 to perform at the Nashville Club. The song&#x27;s title comes from the name of the character in the play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, an old poster of which was hanging in the hotel foyer.

Sting had conceived the song as a bossa nova, although he credits Police drummer Stewart Copeland for suggesting its final rhythmic form as a tango. During recording, Sting accidentally sat down on a piano keyboard in the studio, resulting in the atonal piano chord and laughter preserved at the beginning of the track. The Police were initially diffident about the song, but Miles Copeland III was immediately enthusiastic after hearing it; he became their manager and got them their first record deal with A&amp;M Records.

According to Andy Summers:

==Release==
&quot;Roxanne&quot; became the band&#x27;s debut single for A&amp;M Records. However, despite the praise given by Miles Copeland, the single did not chart upon its initial release. Writing in Record Mirror, singles reviewer Bev Briggs declared &quot;This must be the big breaker for the Police ... what the hell, go out and buy it immediately&quot;.

The band released two further singles in the UK that year: &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;, which charted at number 42, and &quot;So Lonely&quot;, which did not chart. Then, in early 1979, &quot;Roxanne&quot; was issued in North America as the group&#x27;s first single there. In the US, &quot;Roxanne&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in February 1979 and peaked at in April. In Canada, the single peaked one rung higher on the charts at . &quot;Cash Box&quot; said it has &quot;fast slashing rhythm guitar work, spacious arrangement and good singing.&quot; The &quot;Fort Worth Star Telegram&quot; rated it the 5th-best single of 1979.

The song&#x27;s international success spurred a UK re-release in April 1979 of &quot;Roxanne&quot;, which reached in the UK Singles Chart. A live solo version performed by Sting from the 1982 album &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; received moderate airplay on album-oriented rock radio and reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart. The song went on to become a staple of Sting&#x27;s performances during his solo career, and The Police performed it when they reunited in 2003 for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 1997, &quot;Roxanne&quot; was remixed by American rapper and producer Puff Daddy for the compilation &quot;The Very Best of Sting &amp; The Police&quot;. The remix, titled &quot;Roxanne &#x27;97&quot;, featured raps from Pras and samples from UTFO&#x27;s &quot;Roxanne, Roxanne&quot;. &quot;Roxanne &#x27;97&quot; peaked at on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Acclaim==
&quot;Roxanne&quot; has appeared on all of the Police&#x27;s greatest hits albums. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 388 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

In 2000, VH1 ranked the song on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot;, then in 2003 ranked it on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 years&quot;. It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2008, &quot;Roxanne&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Cover versions==
In 1999, English singer-songwriter George Michael covered the song for his fourth solo studio album, &quot;Songs from the Last Century&quot;. In 2006, singer Dilana performed &quot;Roxanne&quot; on the CBS reality television show Rock Star: Supernova and subsequently released the cover as a single. In 2012, the song was covered by singer Juliet Simms for the reality television show &quot;The Voice&quot;. Her cover reached No. 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

For the 2001 jukebox musical romantic drama film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; directed, produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, the song &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; was composed as a fusion of &quot;Roxanne&quot; with &quot;Tanguera&quot; by Mariano Mores. The message is, as stated by one character: &quot;Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself.&quot; The song was performed by Jacek Koman, Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and José Feliciano. In the film, the song shows a combination of locations, memories and characters, anchored by the ensemble cast dancing tango.

===&quot;Redlight&quot; by Swedish House Mafia===
In 2022, the song was interpolated by lead singer Sting and Swedish house music supergroup Swedish House Mafia as &quot;Redlight&quot;. It was released on 25 February 2022 as the fourth single from the group&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Paradise Again&quot;.

<doc id="1124771" wikidata="Q1283225" url="?curid=1124771" title="Tyvek">
<text>Tyvek () is a brand of synthetic flashspun high-density polyethylene fibers. The name &quot;Tyvek&quot; is a registered trademark of the American multinational chemical company DuPont, which discovered and commercialized Tyvek in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Tyvek&#x27;s properties—such as being difficult to tear but easily cut, and waterproof against liquids while allowing water vapor to penetrate—have led to it being used in a variety of applications. Tyvek is often used as housewrap, a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction, or as personal protective equipment (PPE).

==History==
Tyvek is a nonwoven product consisting of spun bond olefin fiber. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont textile company working in an experimental lab, who noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe. That fluff was a form of polyethylene, which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that could be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for commercial purposes in April 1967. By 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale. Its products were often used for the construction of houses due to its ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through. In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field.

=== 21st century ===
In 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, The Dow Chemical Company to form DowDuPont. DowDuPont currently manufactures Tyvek at the Spruance plant in Richmond, Virginia, and in Sandweiler-Contern, Luxembourg. In 2018, DowDuPont announced plans to expand the Tyvek production capacity of the Sandweiler-Contern factory.

== Scientific characteristics and properties ==
=== Adhesion and bonding ===
To bond Tyvek to both itself and a variety of substrates, DuPont recommends starch, dextrin, casein, and animal-based adhesives over most synthetic-based adhesives, emphasizing the effectiveness of water-based and quick-drying glues. DuPont also claims that the following adhesives are highly effective:

* Ethylene/vinyl acetate
* Acrylic pressure-sensitive tape
* Solvent-based single-component polyurethane
* Hot glue

Heat sealing can be used to melt Tyvek and cause it to bond to itself, but this form of bonding tends to create puckers in the otherwise flat material. Dielectric bonding can be effective in some circumstances, as is ultrasonic welding.

===Recycling===
Though Tyvek superficially resembles paper (for example, it can be written and printed on), it is plastic, and it cannot be recycled with paper. Some Tyvek products are marked with the #2 resin-code for HDPE, and can be collected with plastic bottles as part of some municipal curbside recycling programs. DuPont runs a program in the United States where disposable clothing, coveralls, lab coats, medical packaging and other non-hazardous Tyvek disposable garments can be recycled, as well as providing a mail-in recycling program for envelopes.

As plastic bag recycling has become more prevalent in the United States, the American Chemistry Council has recommended that plastic film drop-off recycling locations should be able to accept Tyvek.

=== Properties of Tyvek ===
According to DuPont&#x27;s website, Tyvek fibers are (compared to for a human hair). The nondirectional fibers (plexifilaments) are first spun and then bonded by heat and pressure, without binders.

Tyvek is also:

* Lightweight
* Has a Class 1 flammability rating. &quot;When exposed to a flame, Tyvek (R) shrinks away rapidly. If the flame is made to follow the shrinking sheet, Tyvek (R) will melt at 275 F (135 C)&quot; and will burn at 750°F (400°C)
* Chemical-resistant
* Dimensionally stabilized
* Opaque
* Has a neutral pH
* Tear-resistant

==Uses==

=== Construction/engineering ===

* Large sheets of Tyvek are frequently used as housewrap to provide an air barrier between the outer cladding of a structure and the frame, insulation, etc., allowing water vapor to pass but restricting air infiltration.
* Tyvek was used to cover and protect the Reaction Control System (RCS) thruster ports from water and debris, while the shuttle stack was exposed on the launchpad during the latter years of the Space Shuttle program. The Tyvek covers were dislodged shortly after ignition and before the shuttle cleared the tower, posing no strike risk as the shuttle was travelling below .
* Tom Sachs used Tyvek for the outer shell of the spacesuits used in his Space Program series of artworks.

=== Shipping ===

*Tyvek is used by the United States Postal Service for some of its Priority Mail and Express Mail envelopes.
* FedEx also uses it for some of its document envelopes.

=== Government use ===
* New Zealand used Tyvek for its driver&#x27;s licences from 1986 to 1999.

=== Banknotes ===
* Costa Rica (solely their 20 colones bank note, Z series), the Isle of Man, and Haiti have made banknotes from Tyvek. These banknotes are no longer in circulation and have become collectors&#x27; items.

=== Fashion/personal use ===

* Race bibs, or race numbers are often produced on Tyvek paper, so they are less likely to rip during competition.
* Tyvek is often used in garment and other textile labeling due to high durability and washability.
* Tyvek wristbands are used at festivals, conventions, and events where admission and security are concerns, as well as hospitals, resorts, nightclubs, schools, and reunions.
* In 2011, fashion retailer and manufacturer American Apparel included white Tyvek shorts as part of its range.
* In 1976, fashion house Fiorucci made an entire collection out of Tyvek.
* The ultralight backpacking community has begun to use Tyvek for the construction of extremely light yet durable backpacks. In 2012, The Open Company released a foldable city map made of one of the stiffer variants of Tyvek.
* Increasingly, reused Tyvek material is being used by home crafters. Protective sleeves for CDs and DVDs, tote bags, and origami wallets also use Tyvek-containing materials.
* Tyvek is also used as a durable fabric in shoes.

=== Medical ===
* Tyvek is extensively used for laboratory and medical packaging as the material withstands conditions such as gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide gas which are used to sterilize equipment and surgical devices.
* NSW Police, Australia uses Tyvek overalls to preserve the integrity of forensic evidence at a crime scene, while also protecting &quot;the wearer from the risk of exposure to biological substances, dirt and liquid splashes.&quot;

=== Personal protective equipment (PPE) ===

* Tyvek coveralls are one-piece garments used for personal protective equipment. They are usually white, commonly worn by mechanics, oil industry workers, painters, insulation installers, and laboratory and cleanroom workers where disposable, one-time use coverall is needed. They are also used for some light HAZMAT applications, such as asbestos and radiation work, but do not provide the protection of a full hazmat suit. Tychem is a sub-brand of Tyvek rated for a higher level of liquid protection, especially from chemicals. DuPont makes Tyvek clothing in different styles from laboratory coats and aprons to complete head-to-toe coveralls with hoods and booties. The latter was notably used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force as emergency limited CBRN gear during the Fukushima nuclear incident.
* Tyvek coveralls, coats or bodysuits are often used during pandemics, for example in the 2013–2016 Western African Ebola virus epidemic, and in the COVID-19 pandemic, to protect health care workers from infection. The Tyvek suits which are most frequently used during the COVID-19 pandemic are sold between $5-$15 USD per piece. Due to a lack of sufficient stock of adequate PPE during the coronavirus crisis, Tyvek PPE became scarce in many places. Tyvek bodysuits are generally meant for one-time use. However, Tychem suits contaminated with the virus SARS-CoV-2 can be disinfected and reused a limited number of times.

<text>Pollard Hopewell (between 1786 and 1789 - June 1, 1813) was a midshipman in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. He was killed in the battle of the US frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot; with the British frigate &quot;Shannon&quot;.

He was the only child of Pollard Hopewell and his wife, Catherine Hebb, who were married on December 19, 1785. Pollard, Jr. was born sometime between 1786 and 1789. He was orphaned at an early age. His father died in 1796 and his mother died on August 5, 1799. Pollard, Jr. was left in the care of his uncle, James Hopewell.

Hopewell entered the navy as a midshipman on June 4, 1812, from St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland. He reported to the frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on August 21. With a new crew, Captain James Lawrence put to sea to engage the British frigate HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; on June 1, 1813. Despite their captain&#x27;s famous cry, &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship&quot;, the crew was overwhelmed and the ship taken. Midshipman Hopewell was among those killed, as was Lawrence.

==Namesakes==
Two ships were named USS &quot;Hopewell&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="1124781" wikidata="Q62214" url="?curid=1124781" title="Gerhard Stoltenberg">
<text>Gerhard Stoltenberg (29 September 1928 – 23 November 2001) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and minister in the cabinets of Ludwig Erhard, Kurt Georg Kiesinger and Helmut Kohl. He served as Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein from 1971 to 1982 and as President of the Bundesrat from 1977 to 1978.

==Life==

=== Early life and career ===
Stoltenberg was born in Kiel in northern Germany. In 1944 he became a navy assistant (&quot;HJ-Marinehelfer&quot;), a Hitler Youth auxiliary in the Kriegsmarine. After the war, when he was no longer a prisoner of war, he completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1949. Stoltenberg began studying history, sociology and philosophy at the University of Kiel. In 1954 he graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy and worked as an academic in Kiel. In 1960 he became a professor (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;). In the years 1965 and from 1969 to 1970, Stoltenberg was the director of Friedrich Krupp GmbH in Essen.

=== Political career ===
Since 1947 Stoltenberg had been member of the CDU. In the years 1955 to 1961, he was federal leader of the Junge Union, the youth&#x27; organisation of the CDU. From 1955 Stoltenberg had different positions in the CDU. From 1971 until 1989, he was chairman of the CDU in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Moreover, Stoltenberg served as vice chairman of the federal CDU since 1969.

Stoltenberg was member of the state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein from 1954 to 1957, and from 1971 to 1982. From 1957 to 1971, and from 1983 until 1998, Stoltenberg also served as a member of the federal German legislature, the Bundestag. As a junior member of parliament and member of the budget committee, he was the first to introduce to the 1959 federal budget a flat grant of DM 5,000,000 for political education (training of party activists) to be transferred to federal party headquarters.

On 24 May 1971, Stoltenberg was elected minister-president of the state of Schleswig-Holstein and remained in this position until 1982.

In 1982, he became federal minister of finance under chancellor Helmut Kohl. He left this position when he was appointed minister of defence from 1989 on, replacing Rupert Scholz. He resigned from this position on 31 March 1992.

Stoltenberg died in Bad Godesberg in 2001.

==Personal life==
Stoltenberg was married and had two children. He was a member of the Lutheran church.

<doc id="1124785" wikidata="Q7300581" url="?curid=1124785" title="Reading Buses">
<text>Reading Transport Limited, trading as Reading Buses, is an English municipal bus operator owned by Reading Borough Council, serving the towns of Reading, Bracknell, Newbury, Slough, Windsor, Maidenhead, Wokingham and the surrounding areas in the counties of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Hampshire, as well as parts of Greater London.

==History==
===Horse tram era===
The origins of Reading Transport can be traced back to the 19th century, when the privately owned Reading Tramways Company (part of the Imperial Tramways Company) was formed. The company was authorised to construct and operate a horse tram route on an east–west alignment from Oxford Road through Broad Street in the town centre to Cemetery Junction. This route formed the core of what became known as the &quot;main line&quot; of the tram and trolleybus network.

Construction started in January 1879, with the entire line open by May. A fleet of six single-decked cars were initially used, with 31 horses, providing a 20-minute frequency. The cars operated from a depot on the south side of the Oxford Road, immediately to the east of Reading West railway station. By the 1890s the whole fleet had been replaced by double-decked cars operating at a 10-minute frequency. The company made several proposals to add routes and electrify the system, but none of these were implemented, and in 1899 the borough corporation decided to purchase the system.

The purchase deal was completed on 31 October 1901, and Reading Corporation Tramways came into being. The corporation set out about first extending, and then electrifying the system. The extensions were completed by December 1902, and the last horse cars ran in July of the following year.

===Electric tram era===
The new electric trams started operating in July 1903. Extensions were constructed to the Wokingham Road and London Road (both from Cemetery Junction), and new routes added to Whitley, Caversham Road, Erleigh Road and Bath Road. The trams operated from a new depot in Mill Lane, a site that was to remain Reading Transport&#x27;s main depot until it was demolished to make way for The Oracle shopping mall in 1998.

The electric tram services were originally operated by 30 four-wheeled double decked cars supplied by Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. In 1904, six bogie cars and a water car (used for keeping down the dust on the streets) were added to the fleet, from the same manufacturer. No further trams were acquired, and a planned extension from the Caversham Road terminus across Caversham Bridge to Caversham itself was abandoned because of the outbreak of World War I. The war also led to a significant maintenance backlog.

In 1919, Reading Corporation started operating its first motor buses. These ran from Caversham Heights to Tilehurst, running over the tram lines and beyond the tram termini. Because of the state of the track, the Bath Road tram route was abandoned in 1930, followed by the Erleigh Road route in 1932. Eventually it was decided that the tramways should be abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, operating over extended routes. The last tram ran on the Caversham Road to Whitley route in July 1936, and the last car on the &quot;main line&quot; ran in May 1939.

===Trolleybus era===
The first trolleybus wiring erected was a training loop on Erleigh Road, which opened in early 1936. This loop was never used in public service, and was subsequently dismantled. Public service commenced on 18 July 1936, on a route replacing the tram route from Caversham Road to Whitley Street. In May 1939, the remaining tram routes from Oxford Road to Wokingham Road and London Road were converted to trolleybus operation, with a short extension from Wokingham Road to the Three Tuns, and a much longer extension from the Oxford Road through the centre of Tilehurst to the Bear Inn. The extended &quot;main line&quot;, from the Three Tuns to the Bear, still exists today as bus route 17, the town&#x27;s busiest and most frequent route, and the first to be designated a premier route.

During World War II a trolleybus branch was constructed from the Oxford Road to Kentwood Hill, enabling trolleybuses to replace motor buses with a consequential saving in precious oil-based fuel. In 1949 the Whitley Street line was extended to Whitley Wood and Northumberland Avenue, and a short branch was built to Reading General station. Subsequent short extensions took the system to its full extent, with the Kentwood route running to Armour Hill and the Northumberland Avenue line running to the junction with Whitley Wood Road.

By 1965, most UK trolleybus systems had closed, and the manufacturers of the overhead equipment gave notice that they would cease production. At the same time the trolleybuses were criticised in the local press because they cost more to operate than motor buses and were inflexible, even though the trolleybuses were profitable (Reading&#x27;s motor buses made a loss), faster and less polluting. Reading Corporation decided to abandon the trolleybus system, and the routes were phased out between January 1967 and November 1968.

The UK&#x27;s first contra-flow bus lane was instigated along Kings Road, when that road was made one-way in the early 1960s. The trolleybuses continued to operate two-way, as it was considered uneconomic to erect wiring on the new inbound route, London Road. The concept of the contra-flow bus lane was proved successful, and adopted in other places for motor buses.

===Expansion and competition===
The Transport Act 1980 deregulated long distance bus services. Reading Transport took advantage of this new freedom to start a service from Reading through London to Southend. The service was numbered X1 and was run jointly with Southend Transport. In 1982 the X1 was shortened to run from Reading to Aldgate in East London, under the Goldline brand, and joint operation ceased.

As a result of the legislation that accompanied the deregulation of local bus services in 1986, the operations of Reading Transport were transferred to Reading Transport Limited, an arms length company whose shares were held by Reading Borough Council. Bus deregulation also meant that the local council no longer had any power to regulate the routes and fares of Reading Transport, nor could they prevent other operators from starting competitive services within the borough. Councillor Tony Page was appointed to chair the new company, a role he would continue to hold until 2005.

In 1991 Reading Transport was rebranded Reading Buses. In 1992 Reading Transport acquired the Reading and Newbury operations of BeeLine, one of the privatised successors to the state-owned Alder Valley. These acquisitions led to Reading Transport operating buses in Newbury, and in the rural areas around Reading and Newbury, for the first time. Additionally, BeeLine had operated a Reading to London service under the LondonLink name, and that was merged into the Goldline service and the resulting service renamed London Line. The Goldline name was retained for use by Reading Transport&#x27;s non-scheduled service business. The London Line service ceased in 2000.

Reading Buses faced competition on Reading urban routes from 1994, when Reading Mainline, an independent company, started operations with 10 AEC Routemasters acquired from Southend Transport, later expanding to 45 Routemasters on letter-designated routes. Reading Buses initially retaliated with the registration of a new limited-stop service using Optare MetroRiders under the Fast-Line brand before introducing a low-cost unit with unbranded minibuses running against Mainline routes E, F and H. Labour shortages created problems for the competitor, and Reading Buses acquired Reading Mainline in May 1998. Reading Transport continued to operate the Routemasters under the Reading Mainline brand until they were finally withdrawn on 22 July 2000.

In December 2017, Reading Buses started to serve London again when it took over Green Line Coaches route 702 from Bracknell to the Green Line Coach Station at Victoria via Windsor and Slough from First Berkshire. In January 2018 Reading Buses took over two routes (2 and 5), and won Slough Borough Council tenders for evening (4) and Sunday services (6) from First Berkshire.

In September 2018, Reading Buses purchased Newbury &amp; District from Weavaway. The companies have worked together in the past, most noticeably on the Jet Black 1 service which operates between Reading and Newbury. In March 2019, Courtney Buses was purchased with 57 buses. In November 2019, routes 2 (which had already been withdrawn as a result of too much competition from Courtney in May 2018, but added back into the company after the purchase in March 2019) and 5 in Slough and Windsor were transferred to the Courtney Buses division, with 2 other routes, which Courtney had taken over from First Berkshire (10/15) also grouped in a similar manner. However, First won the tenders for the evening service 4 and Sunday service 6 back.

===Route branding===
Since 2004, Reading Buses and Reading Borough Council have made a significant investment in upgrading the quality of Reading&#x27;s main urban bus routes. In autumn of that year, Reading Buses introduced its first branded &quot;Premier Route&quot; in the form of the number 17, running between the Three Tuns on Wokingham Road and the Bear Inn at Tilehurst via the town centre and Oxford Road, and the linear descendant of the old &quot;main line&quot;. This was intended as the first in a series of such routes, each providing a weekday daytime frequency of between 3 and 8 buses per hour. Each premier route, or group of routes, would be allocated a distinctive colour, to be used on the buses on that route, and also on maps and other publicity.

Since then the premier route concept has been rolled out on most of Reading&#x27;s urban routes. In April 2009, a similar concept was introduced to some of Reading Buses&#x27; longer distance rural routes. These were rebranded as &quot;Vitality Routes&quot;, using specially branded green and silver or red and silver buses. In 2014, these too were changed to a colour brand, becoming &#x27;Lime Routes&#x27;. Most longer distance and interurban services now have animal related branding, with the lion to Bracknell and the leopard to Wokingham. The lime brand is still retained on the service to Mortimer.

==Current operations==
===Reading Buses===
Reading Transport operates public service buses under the Reading Buses brand throughout the town of Reading, and along a number of corridors out to other local towns. All routes have a colour scheme, a concept first introduced in 2004 with the introduction of &#x27;Premier Routes&#x27;, where each route or group of routes allocated a distinctive colour. These colours are used on the buses used on that route, and also on maps and other publicity. Urban town area routes provide a weekday daytime frequency of between 2 and 8 buses per hour, depending on the route.
Five of the urban routes now operate 24 hours a day, reflecting the level of demand for local buses around the clock:
* Emerald 5 and 6 to Whitley Wood
* Purple 17 between Tilehurst and Wokingham Road Three Tuns (a pub/restaurant)
* Claret 21 to Lower Earley
* Yellow 26 to Calcot IKEA (when IKEA is shut, buses terminate at Calcot Sainsburys)
Out of town routes operate at lower frequency, with between one and four buses an hour. These operate out as far as Newbury, Henley-on-Thames, Wokingham, Bracknell and Riseley:
*JetBlack 1 to Newbury
*Lime 2/2a to Burghfield Common, Mortimer and Tadley (AWE)
*Leopard 3 to Arborfield and Wokingham
*Lion 4/X4 to Wokingham and Bracknell 
*Pink 25 to Peppard Common
*Aqua 28 to Henley-on-Thames
*Azure 43 to Pangbourne and Upper Basildon
*Mereoak Park and Ride 600 to Mereoak Park and Ride, Riseley and Shinfield.
Reading Buses also operate the Hospital Park and Ride service 300, which runs between the Thames Valley Park and Ride and the Mereoak Park and Ride via the Royal Berkshire Hospital and the University of Reading, and the Winnersh Triangle Park &amp; Ride 500.

The Thames Valley P&amp;R service 400 was indefinitely suspended in July 2022 due to low usage and a lack of funding.

===Newbury &amp; District===
In September 2018, Reading Buses purchased Newbury &amp; District from Weavaway.

The operated services include:

* 1a/1c circulars between Newbury Wharf and Thatcham Broadway.
* 1d to Thatcham Broadway.
* 2/2a/2c to Wash Common, Tesco Superstore and Pigeons Farm.
* 3/3a/3c/3x to Hungerford.
* 4/4a/4b/4c to Speen and Lambourn.
* 6/6a to East &amp; West Ilsley.
* 8 to Tesco Superstore and Pigeons Farm.
* 9/9b/9c to Newbury Racecourse, Tesco Superstore and Pigeons Farm.
* 103/103a/b/c to the Greenham Business Park and Tesco Superstore.
* V1 shuttle service between Newbury Rail Station and the Vodafone Campus.
* 730/731 between Basingstoke, Frimley and Heathrow.

All services (except 3c, which continues to Thatcham Broadway) serve the Newbury Wharf Bus Station.

The 1a/c/d, 103/103a/b/c, 730/731 and V1 services are operated solely by Reading Buses. All other routes are operated on behalf of West Berkshire Council.

===Thames Valley Buses===

In December 2017, it was announced that Reading Buses was to take on three services withdrawn by First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley in the Slough area. A fourth route was later added. The &quot;Thames Valley Buses&quot; name, historically associated with Thames Valley Traction, was used for the new services. Operation began on 20 January 2018.

In November 2019, the Thames Valley and Courtney Buses brands began to be combined, which was a gradual process that was complete by April 2021, with Slough and Windsor being the first areas to change over to Thames Valley, adding two more routes. However, a retendering of contracts by Slough Borough Council saw the two tendered routes won back by First. Since then, Maidenhead and Wokingham routes, along with the trading name, have changed over.

===The London Line 701 and 702 (Windsor Express)===

In December 2017, Reading Buses announced they would take over the Green Line 702 route from First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley. The service had a refreshed livery and was branded &quot;Green Line Express&quot;. In 2018 this was expanded to include the new route 703 between Bracknell and Heathrow.

With the delivery of new vehicles in June 2023, the combined Green Line Express brand was replaced with &quot;The London Line 702&quot;, and &quot;Flightline 703&quot;, the latter now co-branded with Heathrow Airport. The two routes are marketed together in Bracknell under the name &quot;Windsor Express&quot; which is shown prominently at the front of the buses. In addition, &quot;The London Line 701&quot; was introduced to be the brand used on the 3 buses per day from Reading to Slough/Legoland in the early morning, with them making return trips in the late evening.

===Flightline 730/731===
On 21 August 2023, Newbury &amp; District commenced operations on the new Flightline 730/731 route between Basingstoke, Frimley, Camberley and Heathrow.

===National Express===
Reading Buses formerly operated the 925 route between Woking and Heathrow, but this contract was suspended with the onset on the coronavirus pandemic.

Newbury &amp; District also operated two routes, the 402 and select trips of the 507. Two coaches were maintained by N&amp;D during the operation at their Greenham Park depot. The 402 was introduced in early 2023 to make use of otherwise dead (Out of Service) runs between London and Newbury.

The operation of theses services by N&amp;D ended in late 2023, with the 402 being withdrawn completely, and the two coaches being returned to NatEx.

==Obsolete brands==
===Newbury Buses===
Until August 2011, Reading Transport operated public service buses in the town of Newbury and the surrounding rural area under the &quot;Newbury Buses&quot; brand. Two routes were branded using the same &quot;Vitality Route&quot; brand that was used by Reading Buses, and provide weekday daytime frequencies of two buses per hour. Another longer distance route, to Basingstoke, was jointly operated with Stagecoach in Hampshire and branded as &quot;The Link&quot;.

When Reading withdrew from all commercial and tendered work in the Newbury area, the majority of work passed to Newbury &amp; District. &quot;The Link&quot; is now operated by Stagecoach in Hampshire on a revised timetable to reflect the Stagecoach depot being in Basingstoke.

Jet Black 1 was subcontracted to Weavaway Travel in 2011, using several Alexander Dennis Enviro400s, which were owned by Weavaway but in a route-branded version of the Reading Buses livery and on the Reading fleet system. Additional Enviro400s owned by Weavaway in an all-over black livery were also able to be used on the route.

===Goldline Travel===

Reading Buses used the Goldline Travel name for its non-public-service bus operations, including services operated under contract for various local employers. Goldline Travel was also responsible for the operation of Fastrack and Daytrack park and ride services and Nighttrack night bus services, all of which are operated under contract to Reading Borough Council.

Goldline Travel had a two-tone green colour scheme, although most services were operated by vehicles in colour schemes specified by the contracting organisation. Unlike services run by Reading Buses, Goldline gave change on their routes. This was mainly for the benefit of visitors who are more likely to use routes such as park-and-ride.

In May 2008, Goldline won the contract to operate route 142 from Checkendon, Woodcote and Purley to Reading; the route was previously operated by Thames Travel. However, when the route was next tendered, in May 2012, the contract reverted to Thames Travel.

In February 2009, the private hire services run by Goldline ceased, and the coaches were all sold.

===Loddon Bridge Park &amp; Ride===
In 2015, Loddon Bridge Park &amp; Ride route 500 ceased and the site was closed, having been superseded by Winnersh Triangle Park &amp; Ride, following the completion of the new site by Reading and Wokingham Borough Councils.

===Kennections===
Following a contract win from West Berkshire Council, Reading Buses introduced the &quot;Kennections&quot; brand in Newbury in September 2016. These routes were previously run by Newbury &amp; District, the bus service trading name for Weavaway Travel, who in turn took them over from Reading Buses&#x27; now-defunct Newbury Buses brand. All drivers were TUPEd to Reading Buses.

In April 2020, Kennections was merged into Newbury &amp; District, with the latter name being retained. The app was also changed to Newbury &amp; District in September of that year.

===Courtney Buses===

In March 2019, Reading Buses purchased Courtney Buses as part of their expansion across Berkshire.

Between November 2019 and April 2021, the Courtney Buses brand began to be phased out.

==Fleet==
As of October 2024, the fleet consists of 260 buses. The table below shows an overview of the types of buses in use in the current fleet of Reading Buses and its subsidiaries.
===Fuels===

Reading Buses has a history of experimenting with biofuels, including biodiesel and alcohol fuel. By 2008, all but one of Reading&#x27;s bus fleet was fuelled by a mix of 5% biodiesel and 95% conventional diesel.

In late 2007, Reading Buses placed an order with Scania for 14 ethanol-fuelled double decker buses to replace the existing fleet of biodiesel-powered vehicles operating premier route 17. At the time the order was placed, this was the largest order for ethanol-fuelled buses in the UK. These buses started work on 26 May 2008.

In October 2009, it was discovered that instead of the bio-ethanol fuel having been sourced from sugar beet grown in the English county of Norfolk (as had been advertised), it was actually made from wood pulp imported from Sweden. On learning this, Reading Borough councillors launched an investigation into how they and the Reading Transport Board could have been deceived. All the ethanol-powered buses have since been converted to run on the same bio-diesel mix as the rest of the fleet.

Reading Buses had 31 hybrid electric Alexander Dennis Enviro400Hs delivered in 2010 and 2011, however none are now operated as hybrids. One Enviro400H was converted into an experimental battery electric bus in 2019 for use on route 26, while the remaining buses were converted to diesel power and given a full refurbishment.

In May 2013, 20 buses powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) were introduced. These are used on the Greenwave routes, Leopard 3/8/9, Tiger 7 and Bronze 11. A further 14 vehicles arrived in 2014, which work the Lime 2, Leopard 3/8/9 and Pink 22/25.
One member of this fleet, No 420, holds the land speed record for a regular service bus, having achieved 80.82 mph under test conditions in May 2015. It carries a special cow print livery reflecting the fact that the compressed natural gas is, at source, methane derived from cow dung.

In 2017, five CNG-fuelled Scania N280UDs with Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC bodywork, the world&#x27;s first biogas-fuelled double-decker buses, were delivered to Reading Buses for use on the Royal Blue 33 route. One of these buses is named after Richard Wilding. A further 17 CNG-fuelled Scania N280UDs, these fitted with Enviro400 City bodies, arrived in 2018 for the Purple 17 service.

<doc id="1124790" wikidata="Q1473834" url="?curid=1124790" title="Yoshinkan">
<text>Yoshinkan (養神館 &quot;Yōshinkan&quot; lit. &quot;Hall of Spirit Cultivation&quot;) Aikido is a style of aikido that developed after World War II in the Yoshinkan Dojo of Gozo Shioda (1915–1994). Yoshinkan Aikido is often called the &quot;hard&quot; style of aikido because the training methods are a product of Shioda&#x27;s grueling life before the war. Shioda named his dojo &quot;Yoshinkan&quot; after a dojo of the same name that was built by his father, a physician, who wanted to improve both physical and spiritual health. The Yoshinkan style is currently the second largest aikido organization worldwide.

==Style==
As a style of aikido, Yoshinkan is more akin to the pre-war &quot;aikibudo&quot; techniques taught by Morihei Ueshiba, and therefore also generally closer to aikijujutsu than those styles of aikido developed after the war. The unusual emphasis placed on correct form prior to practicing correct flow and timing further contributes to its image as a &quot;hard&quot; style.

Gozo Shioda created a structured method in which beginning students would learn the foundation techniques. Techniques are performed by a pair of students called &quot;uke&quot; (受け, the partner on whom the technique is performed) and &quot;shite&quot; (仕手, the partner who performs the technique). They are categorized by elements such as the initiating attack, the applicable control and whether it is a pin or throw. They are further divided into two groups called &quot;ichi&quot; (first) and &quot;ni&quot; (second) techniques. &quot;Ichi&quot; techniques have a feeling of the energy moving towards &quot;uke&quot;, while &quot;ni&quot; techniques have a feeling of energy moving towards &quot;shite&quot;. For example, in an &quot;ichi&quot; technique, &quot;shite&quot; would move in the same direction as a pull by &quot;uke&quot;, while in a &quot;ni&quot; technique, &quot;shite&quot; would divert or pivot away from a push by &quot;uke&quot;.

The current method of breaking the techniques into steps and the kihon dosa were developed in order to facilitate teaching beginners in a group. The kenshusei codified many of these methods in consultation with Gozo Shioda, especially Kyoichi Inoue and Takashi Kushida.

To remove stiffness from techniques taught in this way, practitioners over the rank of &quot;shodan&quot; also practice timing and flow.

==Techniques==

Yoshinkan Aikido has some 150 &quot;kihon waza&quot; (lit. &quot;basic techniques&quot;), which are practised repeatedly and designed to teach principles of movement, balance, timing, etc. In addition to set techniques, the style includes &quot;kokyunage&quot; (lit. &quot;breath throws&quot;), or techniques in which &quot;uke&quot; attacks and &quot;shite&quot; makes a non-mandatory, short and decisive response. As students progress, they begin to practice &quot;jiyu waza&quot; (lit. free techniques), which is a time-limited free-form attack and defense. In higher grades, &quot;jiyu-waza&quot; is performed against multiple attackers and/or attackers with weapons. Yoshinkan students do not normally practice the &quot;randori&quot; free-form found in other styles of aikido.

The syllabus contains a few weapons forms, although they are rarely practised outside the hombu dojo, where they are taught to &quot;senshusei&quot; students. Jiyu-waza for &quot;yudansha&quot; includes free-form techniques against sword and knife, and some Yoshinkan dojos teach knife take-away techniques. Some Yoshinkan dojos offer &quot;aiki-ken&quot; classes (classes in which aikido principles are investigated through sword practice) and some offer non-aikido weapons training, such as iaido, concurrently with aikido classes.

Like many styles of aikido, Yoshinkan eschews competition; instead, it emphasizes self-defence applications. Yoshinkan aikido is one of the martial arts that has been taught to the Tokyo police.

Besides the usual attention to distance, timing and balance, the Yoshinkan style places particularly heavy emphasis on stance and basic movements. Yoshinkan’s distinctive stance, or &quot;kamae&quot; (lit. &quot;posture&quot; in Japanese), stresses the position of feet and hips. Yoshinkan aikido practitioners stand with hips and shoulders square to the front, the front foot pointing outward and the back foot pointing about 90 degrees to the front foot. Kamae is the foundation of all Yoshinkan aikido techniques and practitioners of Yoshinkan aikido strive to perfect their kamae so that their overall technique will be strengthened. Along with kamae there are 6 &quot;kihon dosa&quot; (lit. &quot;basic movements&quot;) which are considered to be central for the 150 basic techniques. Yoshinkan aikido students practice these diligently to understand how to move their kamae around to put themselves in a strong position. Without proper form in one&#x27;s basic movements one&#x27;s aikido will not be as effective.

==Senshusei course==

In 1990, Gozo Shioda founded the International Yoshinkan Aikido Federation (IYAF) to facilitate the learning of Yoshinkan aikido outside Japan. Under current dojo director Susumu Chino, the Yoshinkan hombu dojo, located in Shinjuku Tokyo, runs an annual 11-month intensive course called the Senshusei course, in which students from Japan and foreign nations train with the Tokyo Metropolitan Riot Police. The book &quot;Angry White Pyjamas&quot; by Robert Twigger is based on the author&#x27;s experiences during the course.

In addition to the Senshusei Course, a number of other Uchi-deshi and specialized training programs have arisen in recent years. For example, Shihan Tsuneo Ando offers live-in training near Tokyo, and Shihan Jacques Payet offers an 11-month training course at Mugenjuku dojo in Kyoto.

==Former Yoshinkan Branches==
Yoshokai aikido is an offshoot of Yoshinkan Aikido based in the United States founded by Takashi Kushida, a direct student of Gozo Shioda and a contemporary of Kyoichi Inoue.

Then-9th dan Kyoichi Inoue, &quot;shihan&quot;, resigned from the Yoshinkan in March 2006 following an internal dispute, later establishing his own branch, Aikido Shinwakan (合氣道親和館). Following Inoue-shihan&#x27;s departure, Tsutomu Chida, 8th dan and then-dojocho of Yoshinkan hombu dojo, also broke away, establishing Aikido Renshinkai (合気道錬身会) in 2008.

<text>TGI Fridays Franchisor, LLC, doing business as TGI Fridays, is an American casual dining restaurant chain focusing primarily on American cuisine. The restaurant&#x27;s name stands for &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot;. TGI Fridays operates over 600 locations in 55 countries, including 124 in the United States. The chain filed for bankruptcy in the United States on November 2, 2024.

==History==
===20th century===


In 1965, Alan Stillman opened the first TGI Fridays restaurant in Manhattan. He lived on 63rd Street between First and York Avenues, in a neighborhood with many airline stewardesses, fashion models, secretaries, and other young, single people on the East Side of Manhattan near the Queensboro Bridge. He hoped that opening a bar would help him meet women. Stillman&#x27;s choices for socializing were non-public cocktail parties or guys&#x27; beer-drinking hangout bars that women usually would not visit; he recalled that &quot;there was no public place for people between, say, twenty-three to thirty-seven years old, to meet.&quot; He sought to recreate the comfortable cocktail party atmosphere in public despite having no experience in the restaurant business.

With US$5,000 of his own money and $5,000 borrowed from his mother, Stillman purchased a bar he often visited, The Good Tavern at the corner of 63rd Street and First Avenue, and renamed it TGI Fridays after the expression &quot;Thank God it&#x27;s Friday!&quot; from his years at Bucknell University. The restaurant opened on March 15, 1965, serving standard American cuisine, bar food, and alcoholic beverages, and emphasized food quality and preparation. 

The exterior featured a red-and-white striped awning and blue paint; the Gay Nineties interior included Tiffany-style lamps, wooden floors, Bentwood chairs, and striped tablecloths; and the bar area added brass rails and stained glass. The employees were young men: handsome jocks in form-fitting red-and-white striped soccer shirts; when a patron was celebrating a birthday, the entire restaurant crew came around with a cake and sang TGI Fridays&#x27; traditional birthday song. Footage of interviews with patrons from this TGI Fridays was featured in Robert Downey Sr.&#x27;s film &quot;No More Excuses&quot; (1968). The first location closed in 1994 and became a British-style pub called &quot;Baker Street&quot;.

Although Malachy McCourt&#x27;s nearby Malachy&#x27;s singles bar preceded TGI Fridays and Stillman credited the media for creating the term, he had unintentionally created one of the first singles bars. It benefited from the near-simultaneous availability of the birth-control pill and Betty Friedan&#x27;s book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;:

TGI Fridays was one of the first to use promotions such as ladies&#x27; night, and Stillman achieved his hopes of meeting women; &quot;Have you seen the movie &quot;Cocktail&quot;? Tom Cruise played me!...Why do girls want to date the bartender? To this day, I&#x27;m not sure that I get it.&quot; He and the restaurant benefited from its location—according to Stillman, 480 stewardesses lived in the apartment building next door—and received publicity in national magazines. TGI Fridays became so popular that it had to install ropes to create an area for those waiting in line, also unusual at the time for a restaurant. A competitor, Maxwell&#x27;s Plum, opened across the street, and others soon followed.

With fellow Bucknell University graduate Ben Benson, Stillman opened other restaurants, including Tuesday&#x27;s, Thursday&#x27;s, Wednesday&#x27;s, and Ice Cream Sunday&#x27;s. Franchising of TGI Fridays began two years after the Manhattan location opened, in a since-closed location in Memphis, Tennessee&#x27;s Overton Square district.

In 1971, Daniel R. Scoggin acquired the rights to eight major Midwest cities. In 1972, he opened with the first of a new prototype in Dallas. The raised square bar and multilevel dining became the company standard. Dallas doubled the sales and tripled profits of TGI Fridays&#x27; previous best. Families began visiting the new suburban locations during the day for casual food; &quot;it took six or seven years, but T.G.I. Fridays became a very different animal&quot;, Stillman said. Attracted by this performance, he merged into the Dallas franchise forming TGI Fridays, Inc., and Scoggin was the CEO for the next 15 years. Scoggin is credited with the then-new 200 seat prototype and many of the TGI Fridays innovations including a large from-scratch menu, potato skins, bartender Olympics, and frozen drinks.

In 1975, the company was sold to Carlson Companies, and Stillman and the original investors departed. Stillman kept the original location and, now married, founded Smith &amp; Wollensky in 1977 with Benson. Scoggin continued as CEO on an earn-out contract and finalized his sale in 1980, signing a new contract to continue as the company&#x27;s CEO.

When the company was passing through the 100-store mark, it issued an initial public offering in 1983 with Goldman Sachs. Scoggin developed the first international franchise and the template for future international development. The first restaurant was opened in the UK with Whitbread PLC. By the time Scoggin departed in 1986, the company had widened its appeal: alcohol consumption was de-emphasized, and quality was emphasized over quantity. The company became privately held again in 1989. The focus was then switched from singles to families.

A brand extension, combining the TGI Fridays concept with the atmosphere of a sports bar, called &quot;Fridays Front Row Sports Grill&quot;, is found at two Major League Baseball stadiums which each overlook the playing field: Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona and Miller Park in Milwaukee. There was also a Friday&#x27;s Front Row Grill for a few seasons at Globe Life Park, then the Texas Rangers home field.

===21st century===
The chain peaked in 2008, having 601 restaurants in the US generating $2 billion in revenue. By 2023, sales had fallen to $728 million.

In October 2009, Haymarket broke the world record for biggest profit made in any week, throughout TGI Fridays&#x27; history, and it has been home to several past winners from the bartenders Olympics, a contest started by Scoggin.

On May 20, 2014, TGI Fridays was sold to Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners. In October 2019, TriArtisan acquired Sentinel&#x27;s stake in TGI Fridays.

Allegro Merger began working towards taking Fridays public in 2019, buying it away from MFP Partners and TriArtisan Capital, but withdrawing in April 2020.

Utz Quality Foods entered a marketing agreement with Inventure Foods in 2017 to use the &quot;TGI Fridays&quot; name for some of its snacks.

In the UK, TGI Fridays re-branded to &quot;Fridays&quot;, dropping the &quot;TGI&quot; prefix during 2020. About three years later, the naming reverted to &quot;TGI Fridays&quot;.
In March 2022, the first &quot;Fridays and Go&quot;, a takeaway and quick service version of TGI Fridays, launched in Dundee, Scotland. Despite initial plans to open up to thirty other branches, it remained the sole example until it closed in October 2024 following the sale of the bankrupt UK franchise.

In October 2023, SouthRock Capital, the operator of all of the TGI Fridays locations in Brazil, declared bankruptcy, continuing to operate most TGI Fridays locations normally while closing a few underperforming ones, while restructuring through the bankruptcy procedure.

On January 4, 2024, TGI Fridays abruptly closed 36 underperforming restaurants and sold eight more to former CEO Ray Blanchette. Most employees were offered transfer to other locations.

In April 2024, TGI Fridays entered an agreement to be acquired by Hostmore LLC, the owner of TGI Friday&#x27;s restaurants in the UK, and for the combined company to go public on the London Stock Exchange.

Friday&#x27;s entered a licensing agreement with Kraft Heinz in May 2024 to sell Fridays-branded appetizers in supermarkets.

===Bankruptcy===
In September 2024, TGI Fridays lost day-to-day control of its assets after failing to submit documents to bondholders on time, with consulting firm FTI Consulting taking temporary control. As a result, Hostmore LLC, the owner of TGI Friday&#x27;s UK restaurants, dropped its plans to acquire TGI Fridays and went into administration, putting an estimated 4,500 jobs at risk. A month later, private equity firms Calveton UK and Breal Capital acquired 51 sites and saved 2,389 jobs, but didn&#x27;t acquire 35 sites which immediately closed, resulting in the loss of 1,012 jobs.

On October 19, 2024, TGI Fridays announced it was seeking financing as it warned that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States within the coming weeks. The company blamed its bankruptcy on rising interest rates, increased competition and heavy debt. On November 2, 2024, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company&#x27;s press release specifically cited its capital structure as one primary driver of its bankruptcy filing. 

On January 2, 2025, it was announced that former CEO Ray Blanchette and his company Sugarloaf Hospitality – which owns seven TGI Fridays franchised restaurants in the US – had been chosen to manage all of TGI Friday&#x27;s franchised restaurants worldwide. It was also announced that nine of the company&#x27;s corporate-owned restaurants had been sold to MERA Corp, a TGI Fridays franchisee based in Cancún, Mexico, for $34.5 million, outbidding Blanchette – who had made a bid of $30 million – for the locations. The sale allows TGI Fridays to repay its $23.9 million bankruptcy loan, with about $8 million in cash left over. On January 29, 2025 it was announced TGI Fridays UK&#x27;s flagship restaurant in Leicester Square, London had closed down. On January 30, 2025, it was reported that 30 more locations had closed, which left the chain with only around 100 locations remaining in the US. 

On February 3, 2025, it was announced that 19 of TGI Fridays&#x27; corporate-owned restaurants had been sold to two separate franchisees: three to Sugarloaf Hospitality and 16 to Yadav Enterprises, and that TGI Fridays had rejected the leases for six more restaurants.

==Controversies==
*In 2013, as part of &quot;Operation Swill&quot;, investigators in New Jersey raided 17 TGI Fridays franchised restaurants owned by The Briad Group. They found that the bars were replacing premium brand alcoholic beverages with lower-cost brands yet charging patrons for the more expensive liquor.
*In 2018, a tipping policy change prompted strikes across TGI Fridays restaurants in the United Kingdom as waiting staff took issue with a decision to redistribute 20% of customer tips paid by card to kitchen staff in lieu of a raise.
*In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, TGI Fridays was criticized by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale for &quot;Digging In&quot; (Defying Demands for Exit or Reduction of Activities). TGI Fridays issued a statement saying that it stood with the people of Ukraine, that the decision whether to close was for local franchisees to make, and that any proceeds received would be donated to Mercy Chefs, an organisation supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.
* In 2022, the US restaurants faced a class-action lawsuit over the content of the TGI Fridays-branded mozzarella stick appetizer manufactured by Inventure Foods, sold in grocery stores. Litigants claimed the sticks contained no mozzarella cheese. Inventure Foods settled the claims for $900,000, agreeing to pay up to $6 per household, in February 2024.

==Franchises==
TGI Fridays is a franchising operation, with franchisees owning most of the outlets. In 2011, the largest franchisee was The Briad Group in New Jersey, which ran 72 restaurants in six states. Briad sold its franchises in 2020.

Whitbread PLC, with 45 locations in the United Kingdom, was a major international franchisee until 2007. On January 17, 2007, Whitbread sold operating rights of all 45 restaurants back to TGI Fridays UK Limited (a consortium consisting of Carlson Restaurants Worldwide Inc. and ABN Amro Capital) thus exiting a partnership formed in 1986. 

TGI Fridays has also been used as a restaurant for hotels run by Country Inns &amp; Suites by Carlson brand. In 2014 the investment trust Electra Private Equity bought Fridays&#x27; British subsidiary with 66 sites across the UK. In 2021 Electra spun off its hospitality business, including Fridays in the UK, as Hostmore PLC. On 18 September 2024 Hostmore PLC entered administration; all UK restaurant locations were offered for sale. 51 sites were sold the following month, while a further 35 closed.

==Design==
The newer TGI Fridays franchises (as well as redesigned restaurants) are more contemporary, with wallpaper, granite exteriors, and red-and-white striped lamps instead of Tiffany. The exteriors have stucco, the entrance doors have F-shaped handles, and a metal cup above the door has a stripe saying &quot;In Here, It&#x27;s always Friday&quot;. The logo design was evolved in 2013 by Jane MacDowall and her creative team in Scotland. Most TGI Fridays have a propeller and a rowing scull on display as part of their antiques, which are actually a part of a story told to all TGI Fridays employees; the scull always contains a pair of saddle shoes and a bottle of champagne to remind employees of the value of teamwork, leadership, and celebrating success. The propeller is always above or near the bar. The thought is that the bar &quot;propels&quot; the restaurant.

Fridays has a large menu with an emphasis on alcoholic beverages. These drinks come in liquid as well as frozen form and TGI often runs specials or creates unique drinks based on seasonality and location.

TGI Fridays formerly served Atkins-approved appetizers, entrées, and desserts. In 2006, the Atkins name was removed from the menu when Atkins filed for bankruptcy, but the restaurant continues to offer both low-carbohydrate and low-fat menu items. The UK and US menus offer gluten-free items.

<doc id="1124796" wikidata="Q5233968" url="?curid=1124796" title="Strange Weather (Glenn Frey album)">
<text>Strange Weather is the fourth solo studio album by Glenn Frey, the guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. It was released in 1992 by MCA. Though considered an improvement from Frey&#x27;s previous album by most critics, it went largely unnoticed by the public. It was a commercial disappointment, failing to chart in the US, and none of its three singles reached the Top 40, a first for Frey. &quot;Part of Me, Part of You&quot; was earlier released as part of the &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; soundtrack and peaked at #55.

It was his last album of original material before his death in 2016, as his next album, &quot;After Hours&quot; (2012), would consist primarily of covers.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann wrote of the album &quot;With his solo career fading, Glenn Frey got serious on his fourth album, but many of the album&#x27;s sentiments sounded strange coming from him.&quot; In a review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), Mark Coleman gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that &quot;Frey seemed determined to make a statement. &quot;Love in the 21st Century&quot; was a catchy but deposable rocker in the vein of his &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack hit &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, but both &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Mine&quot; and &quot;He Took Advantage (Blues for Ronald Reagan)&quot; found him stumbling around in the same rich-rock-star-as-self-righteous-angry-liberal footsteps as Henley.&quot;

<doc id="1124810" wikidata="Q7049542" url="?curid=1124810" title="Nonpartisanship">
<text>Nonpartisanship, also known as nonpartisanism, is a lack of affiliation with, and a lack of bias towards, a political party.

While an &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; definition of &quot;partisan&quot; includes adherents of a party, cause, person, etc., in most cases, nonpartisan refers specifically to political party connections rather than being the strict antonym of &quot;partisan&quot;.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories and the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut are the only bodies at the provincial/territorial level that are currently nonpartisan; they operate on a consensus government system. The autonomous Nunatsiavut Assembly operates similarly on a sub-provincial level.

==India==
In India, the Jaago Re! One Billion Votes campaign was a non-partisan campaign initiated by Tata Tea, and Janaagraha to encourage citizens to vote in the 2009 Indian general election. The campaign was a non-partisan campaign initiated by Anal Saha.

==United States==

Historian Sean Wilentz argues that from the days of George Washington&#x27;s farewell address, to Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s speech at the Democratic national convention in 2004, politicians have called upon Americans to move beyond parties. Wilentz calls this the post-partisan style, and argues that &quot;the antiparty current is by definition antidemocratic, as political parties have been the only reliable electoral vehicles for advancing the ideas and interests of ordinary voters&quot;. However, nonpartisan elections are quite common at the local level, primarily in an effort to keep national issues from being mixed up with local issues.

Today, nonpartisan elections are generally held for municipal and county offices, especially school board, and are also common in the election of judges. The unicameral Legislature of Nebraska is the only state legislature that is entirely officially nonpartisan; additionally, the bicameral Fono of American Samoa is the only territorial legislature that is officially nonpartisan.

Although elections may be officially nonpartisan, in some elections (usually involving larger cities or counties, as well as the Nebraska unicameral) the party affiliations of candidates are generally known, most commonly by the groups endorsing a particular candidate (e.g., a candidate endorsed by a labor union would be generally affiliated with the Democratic Party, while a candidate endorsed by a business coalition would be generally affiliated with the Republican Party).

===Churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations===
Churches and charities in the United States are mainly formed under US Internal Revenue Service tax code 501(c)(3) non-profit organization regulations. To maintain that tax-exempt status, and the ability for donors to take a tax deduction, they are required to remain nonpartisan.

This has caused some to question the ability of organizations that have the appearance of partisanship. 

The Brookings Institution is a Washington, D.C. think tank and 501(c)(3) non-profit, nonpartisan organization. Since its founding in 1916, it has had both identifiable Republicans and Democrats among its leadership. Owing to leadership changes such as this, some argue that it is a good example of a nonpartisan organization. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has at times listed the organization as being liberal, liberal-centrist, centrist, and conservative. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article where it referred to the &quot;conservative Brookings Institution&quot;.

===Nonpartisan League===
In the Progressive Era, the Nonpartisan League was an influential socialist political movement, especially in the Upper Midwest, particularly during the 1910s and 1920s. It also contributed much to the ideology of the former Progressive Party of Canada. It went into decline and merged with the Democratic Party of North Dakota to form the North Dakota Democratic–NPL Party in 1956.

===Milwaukee===
In the history of Milwaukee, the &quot;Nonpartisans&quot; were an unofficial but widely recognized coalition of Republicans and Democrats who cooperated in an effort to keep Milwaukee&#x27;s Sewer Socialists out of as many offices as possible, including in elections which were officially non-partisan, but in which Socialists and &quot;Nonpartisans&quot; were clearly identified in the press. (Such candidates were sometimes called &quot;fusion&quot; candidates.) This lasted from the 1910s well into the 1940s. (The similar effort in 1888 to prevent Herman Kroeger&#x27;s election as a Union Labor candidate had been conducted under the banner of a temporary &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Party&quot; label.) During the period of Socialist-Progressive cooperation (1935–1941), the two sides were called &quot;Progressives&quot; and &quot;Nonpartisans&quot;.

<doc id="1124827" wikidata="Q47233" url="?curid=1124827" title="Dominican Republic national football team">
<text>The Dominican Republic national football team () represents the Dominican Republic in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Dominican Football Federation. The team is a member of the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF, the governing body of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean.

As of 26 October 2023, the Dominican Republic is currently ranked 146th in the FIFA World Rankings. As is the case in many other Caribbean nations, association football has not traditionally been the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. Interest in baseball diverts away from football and contributes to the country&#x27;s lack of success in any major football tournament qualification. As of 2022, the Dominican Republic has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. In 2024, they qualified to the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the first major tournament in their history.

==Home Stadium==
The Dominican Republic National football team is using the following stadiums for their home games:
Cibao FC Stadium,
Felix Sanchez Stadium, and
Estadio Panamericano, San Cristóbal

==History==
The Dominican Football Federation was founded in 1953 and joined FIFA in 1959. The national team played their first games in May 1967 – a two-legged qualifier against Haiti for a place in the football at the 1968 Summer Olympics of Mexico. The first leg was played at home on 21 May and Haiti won 8–0. The second leg in Haiti was won by the hosts 6–0 on 27 May, as Haiti went through 14–0 on aggregate.

The Dominican Republic did not play another match until March 1970, when they entered at the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Games in Panama. They were placed in a group with Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The Dominican Republic lost 5–0 to Venezuela on 4 March, then gained their first ever win on 6 March by beating Puerto Rico 5–0. They did not advance to the next round.

In 1971 the Dominican Republic entered the 1971 Pan American Games in Colombia and were drawn in a group against the Bahamas and Canada. They lost 4–2 to the Bahamas on 31 July and 4–0 to Canada on 2 August and were knocked out.

The team did not play again until 16 December 1973, when they lost 1–0 away to Venezuela. In 1974 the Dominican Republic held the Central American and Caribbean Games, and lost their first match 3–2 to Bermuda on 28 February. On 2 March the team lost 1–0 to Mexico, before beating the Bahamas 2–0 on 4 March. In the final group game on 8 March the Dominican Republic lost 3–2 to Panama and were knocked out.
In 1986 they had their best result in the Central American and Caribbean games finishing 3rd

In 2012, the Dominicans were able to qualify for the 2012 Caribbean Cup. On 7 December they beat hosts Antigua and Barbuda 2–1 but fell 2–1 against Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago.

==Omitted songs==
MCA video released the entire concert on video as &quot;Glenn Frey: Strange Weather Live&quot;, in 1992.

The concert opens with the &quot;Strange Weather&quot; album track &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot;, the 1988 single &quot;Livin&#x27; Right&quot; appears halfway through, and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Partytown&quot; is part of the encore.

<text>Solo Collection is a greatest hits album of American musician Glenn Frey&#x27;s solo career, released March 28, 1995 on MCA Records.

==Reception==

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half stars out of five, stating &quot;Solo Collection performs a welcome service by collecting the highlights from his decidedly uneven solo albums, including all of his biggest hits. Not only is it a perfect introduction, it&#x27;s arguably the most consistent solo record Frey ever released.&quot;

The album did not chart in its initial 1995 release, but reached number 82 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2016 after Frey&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1124847" wikidata="Q711269" url="?curid=1124847" title="Joe Gaetjens">
<text>Joseph Edouard Gaetjens ( ; , 1924 – , 1964 [presumed]) was a soccer player who played as a center forward. Born in Haiti, he represented its national team before and after playing for the United States team in the 1950 FIFA World Cup, in which he scored the winning goal in the 1–0 upset of England.

Gaetjens won his home national championship in 1942 and 1944 with top-level Etoile Haïtienne. He then moved to the American Soccer League (ASL) and led all players with 18 goals in 15 games for New York&#x27;s Brookhattan during the 1949–50 season. He was posthumously inducted into the United States National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1976.

Gaetjens is among the &quot;Les 100 Héros de la Coupe du Monde&quot; (&quot;100 Heroes of the World Cup&quot;), which included the top 100 World Cup Players from 1930 to 1990, a list drawn up in 1994 by the France Football magazine based exclusively on their performances at World Cup level.

== Early life ==
Joe Gaetjens was born in Haiti&#x27;s capital of Port-au-Prince on March 19, 1924, to Edmond and Antonine Defay, a well-to-do Haitian family who lived in an upscale neighborhood of Port-au-Prince called Bois Verna. His great-grandfather Thomas, was a native of Bremen, in northern Germany, who supposedly had been sent to Haiti by Frederick William III, the King of Prussia, as a business emissary arriving shortly after 1825; although the validity for this claim is uncertain by family members. He married Leonie Déjoie, whose father was a general in a time where Haiti&#x27;s independence was officially recognized by France. The family was quite prosperous, and although by the time of Joe&#x27;s birth their wealth had decreased significantly after the United States occupation of Haiti (1915–34), in which the economic isolation of Germany due to World War I and conflicts over family assets between sons took its toll on the family&#x27;s business interests, they were still living among the Haitian elite. When Gaetjens was born, his father registered his birth certificate with the German embassy, in case he ever wanted to gain German citizenship.

==Club career==

===Etoile Haïtienne===
Gaetjens joined Etoile Haïtienne at the age of fourteen and won two Ligue Haïtienne championships in 1942 and 1944. In his first championship appearance, at the age of eighteen, came against longer established Racing Club Haïtien, another club in Port-au-Prince. Down 3–0 at halftime and a heckling goalkeeper directed at Gaetjens after each goal scored, &quot;Ti-Joe&quot; urged his teammates to hold its defense to allow no more goals. Less than ten minutes after Racing&#x27;s last goal, Gaetjens rebounded and scored to break the shutout. At the 53rd minute, Fritz Joseph scored. With seven minutes remaining, Frérot Rouzier scored the tying goal equalizing the match at 3–3. At the final minutes of regulation, a defiant Gaetjens kept on the offense, breaking the tie at 3–4, which ended up being the game-winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;1942/43&quot;&gt;RSSSF – Haiti 1942/43&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Racing Club Haïtien refuses to play matches on the &quot;Jeudi Saint&quot; (&quot;Holy Thursday&quot;); the day of &quot;washing of the feet.&quot; During his tenure with the club, he became known for his goal-scoring headers.

===Brookhattan===
Gaetjens went to New York City in 1947 to study accounting at Columbia University on a scholarship from the Haitian government and concluded that he could not make a living from professional soccer in Haiti. During this time, he played three seasons for Brookhattan of the American Soccer League (ASL). In his first season during 1947–48, he scored the second-most goals in the league with 14. In his third season, he won the league&#x27;s scoring title totaling 18 goals in 15 games during 1949–50. He was making $25 per game, while also working for the Brookhattan owner&#x27;s restaurant and washing dishes.

===Racing Club de Paris and Olympique Alès===
At the end of the World Cup, Gaetjens left for France to play in Division 1, where he briefly played for Racing Club de Paris; scoring twice in four games and then for Division 2 Olympique Alès; scoring twice in fifteen games.

===Etoile Haïtienne===
Gaetjens returned to Haiti in 1954 and remained active in soccer, rejoining Etoile Haïtienne, and also became a spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive. He played a few seasons and then left the game for good in 1957, a few months after the birth of his first son.

==International career==

Gaetjens debuted on the international scene on April 2, 1944, for the Haiti national team, losing to Curaçao, 0–5. In the following match on April 5, 1944, against Venezuela, the Haitian team was shut out 0–2. Both matches were friendlies.

===United States===
His success with Brookhattan attracted the attention of U.S. Soccer, and Gaetjens made the national team for the 1950 World Cup.

Gaetjens played three games at the World Cup, including one of the greatest World Cup upsets in history, in which Gaetjens scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory in which the American soccer team defeated the hugely favored English at Belo Horizonte. Walter Bahr had taken a shot from about 25 yards away and the ball was heading to goalkeeper Bert Williams&#x27;s right. It appeared to be a relatively easy save, but Gaetjens dove headlong and grazed the ball enough that it went to the goalkeeper&#x27;s left instead, with his momentum preventing him from stopping the ball. Williams later considered the goal to be a result of a lucky deflection, but this view was disputed by Laurie Hughes, who was defending Gaetjens on the play.

Although Gaetjens was not a United States citizen, he had declared his intention of becoming one, and under the rules of the United States Soccer Football Association at that time was allowed to play. However, Gaetjens never actually did gain American citizenship.

===Return to Haiti===
On December 27, 1953, Gaetjens played in a World Cup Qualifier for Haiti against Mexico.

== Death and legacy ==
Gaetjens was not interested in politics, but his family was. He was related to Louis Déjoie (his great-grandfather Thomas married Leonie Déjoie), who lost the 1957 Haitian presidential election to François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier, and although the family also had connections to the new president, Gaetjens&#x27;s younger brothers Jean-Pierre and Fred became associated with a group of exiles in the Dominican Republic who wanted to stage a coup.

On , 1964, the morning after Duvalier declared himself &quot;president for life&quot;, the rest of the Gaetjens family fled the country in fear of reprisal for the younger Gaetjens brothers&#x27; rebellious associations, but Joe stayed, thinking that Duvalier&#x27;s regime would be uninterested in him since he was only a sports figure. That morning, he was arrested by the secret police—the Tonton Macoutes—and was taken to a prison called Fort Dimanche notorious for its brutally inhumane practices, where it is presumed he was killed some time later that month. His body has never been found.

In 1972, Gaetjens was honored in a benefit game involving the New York Cosmos and a team composed of local Haitians at Yankee Stadium. Joe Gaetjens was posthumously inducted into the United States National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1976.

In 2010, his son Lesly Gaetjens wrote a biography about his father: &quot;The Shot Heard Around the World: The Joe Gaetjens Story&quot;.

===Number search===
The jersey number worn by Gaetjens during the 1950 World Cup match against England remains unknown, with several accounts from family members and historians unable to verify various claims. The number was not recorded in an official match report; the National Soccer Hall of Fame stated the number was 18 and cited Walter Bahr, but he was unable to verify the claim. An unnamed ESPN producer for &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; who worked with footage of the match for a special dedicated to Gaetjens stated to an ESPN journalist that they were &quot;98 or 99 percent sure&quot; that the number was 18.

===Film controversy===
Gaetjens, although light-skinned, was portrayed by &quot;dark-skinned&quot; Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis in the 2005 film &quot;The Game of Their Lives.&quot; He was also depicted as a practitioner of Voodoo, which outraged his family, leading them to proclaim how ludicrously inaccurate the interpretation was. In reality, Gaetjens, like most Haitians, grew up as a Catholic and went to church every Sunday. His sister, Mireille, voiced her displeasure and condemned the notion over a phone interview by saying: &quot;Our family traded rum and coffee and ran schools... No family member was into voodoo. I&#x27;ve &quot;never&quot; even seen voodoo being practiced. Nobody in the family has &quot;ever&quot; even set foot in a voodoo church!&quot;

==Personal life==
When Gaetjens first arrived in the US from Haiti, he was mistaken for Belgian of the Flemish-speaking part of the country, due to the sounding of his surname ending in &quot;-tjens&quot; and the fact that migration in waves from Belgium were common during the 19th century. However, his great-grandfather was from Bremen of northern Germany and the Gaetjens name is not common in Flanders. Although, a variant does exist over Germany&#x27;s northern border in Denmark as &quot;Gätjens&quot;.

Gaetjens was a fluent speaker of French, Spanish and English.

<text>The 1922 Land Code of the RSFSR (, &quot;Zemelniy kodeks&quot;) was the first principal document that systemized land legislation in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. It was adopted at the 4th session of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) and carried into effect on December 1, 1922.

The 1922 Land Code was elaborated under the supervision and with the direct participation of Vladimir Lenin. The main purpose of the code was to regulate the land tenure by rural communities. Similar land codes were adopted by other republics of the Soviet Union between 1922 and 1929. After the universal agricultural collectivization, land codes of the Soviet republics lost their significance.

In 1970–1971, the Soviet Union adopted new land codes in all of the republics. The 1970 Land Code of the RSFSR was adopted on December 1, 1970.

In modern Russia the 2001 Land Code of the Russian Federation (Земельный кодекс Российской Федерации от 25 октября 2001 г. N 136-ФЗ), with a number of later amendments, is in effect.

<doc id="1124857" wikidata="Q2166649" url="?curid=1124857" title="The Death of the Author">
<text>&quot;The Death of the Author&quot; () is a 1967 essay by the French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes (1915–1980). Barthes&#x27; essay argues against traditional literary criticism&#x27;s practice of relying on the intentions and biography of an author to definitively explain the &quot;ultimate meaning&quot; of a text. Instead, the essay emphasizes the primacy of each individual reader&#x27;s interpretation of the work over any &quot;definitive&quot; meaning intended by the author, a process in which subtle or unnoticed characteristics may be drawn out for new insight. The essay&#x27;s first English-language publication was in the American journal &quot;Aspen&quot;, no. 5–6 in 1967; the French debut was in the magazine &quot;Manteia&quot;, no. 5 (1968). The essay later appeared in an anthology of Barthes&#x27; essays, &quot;Image-Music-Text&quot; (1977), a book that also included his &quot;From Work to Text&quot;.

==Content==
In his essay, Barthes argues against the method of reading and criticism that relies on aspects of an author&#x27;s identity to distill meaning from the author&#x27;s work. In this type of criticism against which he argues, the experiences and biases of the author serve as a definitive &quot;explanation&quot; of the text. For Barthes, however, this method of reading may be apparently tidy and convenient but is actually sloppy and flawed: &quot;To give a text an author&quot; and assign a single, corresponding interpretation to it &quot;is to impose a limit on that text.&quot;

Readers must thus, according to Barthes, separate a literary work from its creator in order to liberate the text from interpretive tyranny (a notion similar to Erich Auerbach&#x27;s discussion of narrative tyranny in biblical parables). Each piece of writing contains multiple layers and meanings. In a well-known passage, Barthes draws an analogy between text and textiles, declaring that a &quot;text is a tissue [or fabric] of quotations&quot;, drawn from &quot;innumerable centers of culture&quot;, rather than from one, individual experience. The essential meaning of a work depends on the impressions of the reader, rather than the &quot;passions&quot; or &quot;tastes&quot; of the writer; &quot;a text&#x27;s unity lies not in its origins&quot;, or its creator, &quot;but in its destination&quot;, or its audience.

No longer the focus of creative influence, the author is merely a &quot;scriptor&quot; (a word Barthes uses expressively to disrupt the traditional continuity of power between the terms &quot;author&quot; and &quot;authority&quot;). The scriptor exists to produce but not to explain the work and &quot;is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, [and] is not the subject with the book as predicate.&quot; Every work is &quot;eternally written here and now&quot;, with each re-reading, because the &quot;origin&quot; of meaning lies exclusively in &quot;language itself&quot; and its impressions on the reader.

Barthes notes that the traditional critical approach to literature raises a thorny problem: how can we detect precisely what the writer intended? His answer is that we cannot. He introduces this notion of intention in the epigraph to the essay, taken from Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s story &quot;Sarrasine&quot; in which a male protagonist mistakes a castrato for a woman and falls in love with him. When, in the passage, the character dotes over his perceived womanliness, Barthes challenges his own readers to determine who is speaking, and about what. &quot;Is it Balzac the author professing &#x27;literary&#x27; ideas on femininity? Is it universal wisdom? Romantic psychology? ... We can never know.&quot; Writing, &quot;the destruction of every voice&quot;, defies adherence to a single interpretation or perspective. (Barthes returned to &quot;Sarrasine&quot; in his book &quot;S/Z&quot;, where he gave the story a rigorous close reading.)

Acknowledging the presence of this idea (or variations of it) in the works of previous writers, Barthes cited in his essay the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, who said that &quot;it is language that speaks.&quot; He also recognized Marcel Proust as being &quot;concerned with the task of inexorably blurring ... the relation between the writer and his characters&quot;; the Surrealist movement for employing the practice of &quot;automatic writing&quot; to express &quot;what the head itself is unaware of&quot;; and the field of linguistics as a discipline for &quot;showing that the whole of enunciation is an empty process.&quot; Barthes&#x27; articulation of the death of the author is a radical and drastic recognition of this severing of authority and authorship. Instead of discovering a &quot;single &#x27;theological&#x27; meaning (the &#x27;message&#x27; of the Author-God)&quot;, readers of a text discover that writing, in reality, constitutes &quot;a multi-dimensional space&quot;, which cannot be &quot;deciphered&quot;, only &quot;disentangled&quot;.

&quot;Refusing to assign a &#x27;secret&#x27;, an ultimate meaning&quot; to text &quot;liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases—reason, science, law.&quot;

==Influences and overview==
Ideas presented in &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; were anticipated to some extent by New Criticism, a school of literary criticism important in the United States from the 1940s to the 1970s. New Criticism differs from Barthes&#x27; theory of critical reading because it attempts to arrive at more authoritative interpretations of texts. Nevertheless, the crucial New Critical precept of the &quot;intentional fallacy&quot; declares that a poem does not belong to its author; rather, &quot;it is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.&quot; Barthes himself stated that the difference between his theory and New Criticism comes in the practice of &quot;disentangling&quot;. Barthes&#x27; work has much in common with the ideas of the &quot;Yale school&quot; of deconstructionist critics, which numbered among its proponents Paul de Man and Barbara Johnson in the 1970s, although they are not inclined to see meaning as the production of the reader. Barthes, like the deconstructionists, insists upon the disjointed nature of texts, their fissures of meaning and their incongruities, interruptions, and breaks. A. D. Nuttall&#x27;s essay &quot;Did Meursault Mean to Kill the Arab? The Intentional Fallacy Fallacy&quot; (&quot;Critical Quarterly&quot; 10:1–2, June 1968, pp. 95–106) exposes the logical flaws in the &quot;Intentional fallacy&quot; argument.

Michel Foucault also addressed the question of the author in critical interpretation. In his 1969 essay &quot;What is an Author?&quot;, he developed the idea of &quot;author function&quot; to explain the author as a classifying principle within a particular discursive formation. Foucault did not mention Barthes in his essay but its analysis has been seen as a challenge to Barthes&#x27; depiction of a historical progression that will liberate the reader from domination by the author.

Jacques Derrida paid ironic homage to Barthes&#x27; &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; in his essay &quot;The Deaths of Roland Barthes&quot;.

Literary theorist Seán Burke dedicated an entire book to opposing &quot;The Death of the Author&quot;, pointedly called &quot;The Death and Return of the Author&quot;.

In the satirical essay &quot;Roland Barthes&#x27; Resurrection of the Author and Redemption of Biography&quot; (&quot;Cambridge Quarterly&quot; 29:4, 2000, pp. 386–393), J.C. Carlier (a pseudonym of Cedric Watts, Research Professor of English at the University of Sussex) argues that the essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; is the litmus test of critical competence. Those who take it literally automatically fail that test; those who take it ironically and recognize a work of fine satiric fiction are those who pass the test.

Scholarship on pedagogy has also taken up several themes from &quot;Death of the Author&quot; and applied them to different domains of academic and instructional research. While specific projects vary, concerns across research construct theoretical frameworks that rely on Barthes&#x27; notion of emphasizing the reader&#x27;s impressions in textual practices. However, viewed through a pedagogical lens, researchers regard encounters between students and texts as dialogic, empowering transactions that should draw on the student&#x27;s knowledge to take on language&#x27;s multiplicity. Along these lines, scholarship has explored broad and varied topics within pedagogy, such as information literacy instruction, critical thinking skills and literary interpretation, academic subjectivity, and writing pedagogies. For example, a model of information literacy instruction for librarians extends Barthes&#x27; idea of deemphasizing author-centered ways of understanding texts by promoting dialogues between librarians and students. The goal of this model is for the librarian to listen to the student&#x27;s values and beliefs and move from being a &quot;fact provider&quot; and adopt a &quot;learner-centered&quot; approach. Additional research on developing critical thinking skills in interpreting literary texts extends this idea of shifting responsibility of learning onto the learner. Specific to the classroom environment, this research considers how literature can be used as a conceptual link for students to bridge the classroom content to the outside world. In a Barthesian tradition, its pedagogical aim stresses the student&#x27;s subjectivity by scaffolding literary questions that start at the surface but eventually rise to an interpretive level encouraging students to express their own views. Importantly, personal response is emphasized in this model over &quot;right or wrong&quot; answers.

Other research has drawn on &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; only to subvert its original ideas of disrupting the singularity of author-centered literary criticism and interpretation by suggesting collaborative methods of authorship that enable plural pathways of knowledge. For example, in a recent attempt to challenge the &quot;individualist author model of scholarship in the humanities&quot;, scholars experimented with forms of peer production and publishing by pursuing an authorial collaboration of writing among scholars. Although the model articulates an authorial stance, it advances Barthes&#x27; ideas of encouraging multiple perspectives, interpretations, and ideological positions through the use of language by rendering authorship a pursuit of collective intelligence that calls into question traditional norms of scholarship. Additional studies further this notion with nuanced attention to collective authorship. The first explores having a group of youth with disabilities convey their life-narratives through fictional stories, while the second looks at teacher candidates writing autobiographies with specific attention to their values about teaching. Both take up the idea of a text&#x27;s potential for dialogic engagement with its constructor of meaning, and how that dialogic process is essential for self-reflexivity and empowerment in the literacy process.

== Applications for critical pedagogy ==
Themes from Roland Barthes&#x27; essay have also been applied to research on critical pedagogy. Previous research projects have emphasized foregrounding students&#x27; knowledge in literacy practices, and in this way stress Barthes&#x27; central idea of relying on the reader&#x27;s impressions for literary study. These studies advocate learning for students that is dialogic in nature, claiming that students should arrive at their own knowledge by exploring and questioning a text&#x27;s multiple meanings. While the theoretical frameworks, methods, research designs, and audiences of particular studies vary, the central idea across projects, commonly seen in constructivist methods of pedagogy, is to increase a sense of student ownership and autonomy by having them consider multiple forms of knowledge against their own beliefs and values. For example, in one study, a model of information literacy instruction encourages a conversational approach to recommending and locating texts between librarians and students, rather than only suggesting texts by genre or author names. These projects extend one of Barthes&#x27; underlying points in his essay in which he emphasizes trusting subjective knowledge over depending on traditional and authoritative bodies of knowledge.

Other research has subverted Barthes&#x27; original thesis of disrupting author-centered literary criticism by suggesting collaborative methods of authorship. These studies describe writing models in which multiple authors &quot;co-construct&quot; stories and articles together, inviting writers to contribute their own ideas and knowledge and create a product that resembles an assemblage of voices and perspectives. Although the premise of these models advance the author&#x27;s position, the collective, peer-based process of how these texts are constructed challenge traditional authority of singular authorship. These studies extend Barthes&#x27; initial ideas of how a text contains multiple ideological positions and interpretive possibilities, as well as disputing authorial influence and force, by offering a democratic and pluralistic framework for authorship.

<text>The Risle (; less common: &quot;Rille&quot;) is a long river in Normandy, left tributary of the Seine.

The river begins in the Orne department west of L&#x27;Aigle, crosses the western part of the department of Eure flowing from south to north and out into the estuary of the Seine on the left bank near Berville-sur-Mer. Its upper valley is part of the Pays d&#x27;Ouche, its lower valley separates the regions of the Lieuvin and Roumois.

The Risle is regarded as a coastal river. Fishing is common downstream at Pont-Audemer.

The river and surrounding areas are parts of a protected Natura 2000 site called Risle, Guiel, Charentonne.

On July 30, 2012, the Risle vanished in a ponor between La Ferrière-sur-Risle and La Houssaye. It runs underground for .

Its only major tributary is the Charentonne. The Risle flows through the following departments and communes:

*Orne: Sainte-Gauburge-Sainte-Colombe, L&#x27;Aigle
*Eure: Rugles, Beaumont-le-Roger, Brionne, Montfort-sur-Risle, Pont-Audemer

<text>The Dominica national football team represents Dominica in international football and is controlled by the Dominica Football Association. They are a member of CONCACAF.

Since becoming a FIFA member on 1995, Dominica has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, nor the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Dominica played its first international match in 1932, against Martinique, a match that ended in a 1–0 victory. In the 1940s they participated in the 1948 Coupe des Caraibes, losing in the preliminaries against Martinique 5–0 but qualified due to Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s withdrawal. In the competition proper, Dominica again faced Martinique, losing 6–0 and being eliminated.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Dominica played in several editions of the Windward Islands Tournament, winning the competition in 1971 with two 3–0 victories over Saint Vincent and Grenada, and a 2–2 draw against Saint Lucia. In the 1980s, Dominica regularly participated in the qualifying rounds of the CFU Championship, although they were unable to make it into the tournament proper.

===1990s===

After the creation of the Caribbean Cup in 1989, Dominica was only able to qualify for the group stage in the 1994 edition. They could not get past the first phase, after losing to the hosts Trinidad and Tobago 5–0 and Guadeloupe 4–0. They were only able to draw 1–1 with Barbados. They next qualified for the 1998 Caribbean Cup, being eliminated again in the first round, this time with three defeats against Martinique 5–1, Antigua and Barbuda 2–1 and Trinidad and Tobago 8–0. Dominica has not managed to return to the final phase of the Caribbean Cup since.

Dominica participated in World Cup qualification for the first time in the 1998 qualifiers beating Antigua and Barbuda in the first round (3–3 in Roseau and 1–3 in St. John&#x27;s) before losing in the second phase to Barbados (1–0 in both Roseau and Bridgetown).

===2000–present===

In the 2002 qualifiers, the &quot;Pericos&quot; succumbed to Haiti 7–1 on aggregate, and in the 2006 qualifiers, after beating the Bahamas with an aggregate result of 4–2, the Dominicans faced the Mexican team that crushed them 10–0 in the first leg, then 8–0 at Aguascalientes. The decade would end with an elimination at the hands of Barbados, just like in 1996, this time as part of the 2010 qualifiers (1–1 in Roseau and 0–1 in Bridgetown).

On 15 October 2010, Dominica achieved the greatest victory in its history, beating the British Virgin Islands 10–0, with 5 goals from striker Kurlson Benjamin - in the first qualifying round of the 2010 Caribbean Cup. The following year, in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Dominica was drawn against Panama and Nicaragua. They lost all four of their games, failing to score a goal and conceding 11. They were eliminated from 2018 World Cup qualification by Canada, who beat them 6–0 over two legs.

<text>William Edward Daily (August 30, 1927 – September 4, 2018) was an American actor and comedian known for his sitcom work as Major Roger Healey on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and Howard Borden on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;.

==Early life and early career==
William Edward Daily was born on August 30, 1927, in Des Moines, Iowa, the son of Fern Ellis and Raymonde Daily. Two weeks after his son was born, Daily&#x27;s father left his home to buy a loaf of bread and never returned. In 1939, Daily and his family moved from Des Moines to Chicago, Illinois, where he spent the rest of his youth. Following graduation from Lane Technical High School, Daily studied for a time at the Peterson Theatre School, then left home to become a professional musician, playing upright bass with jazz bands in numerous clubs across the Midwest. In the early 1950s, he was drafted into the United States Army, serving in the Korean War with an artillery unit and later with an entertainment unit.

==Comedy career==
===1950s to early 1960s===
Following his time in the Army, Daily began performing stand-up comedy and gradually began playing some of the bigger clubs in the U.S. After graduating from the Goodman Theatre School, Daily worked for the NBC television station WMAQ in Chicago as an announcer and floor manager. He eventually became a staff director. Daily stated that preparing for a Chicago-area Emmy Award telecast, he asked a young Bob Newhart to come up with a routine about press agents that resulted in the routine &quot;Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue&quot;. During his days off, Daily drove to Cleveland to write, direct and perform on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. In 1963, Steve Allen appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, saw Daily do a comedy bit and offered him a job in Los Angeles as an announcer, writer and performer on his syndicated show.

===Mid-1960s to early 1970s===
Daily appeared in guest spots on &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;, before veteran sitcom writer Sidney Sheldon took notice of Daily&#x27;s work and hired him for the supporting role of Army Captain Roger Healey, on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, in 1965. As astronaut Tony Nelson&#x27;s best friend and NASA colleague, Roger often helped to solve the absurd social, military or other existential dilemmas that Nelson&#x27;s sultry-but-naive genie (Barbara Eden) would unwittingly cause one or both of them at Cape Kennedy, during the early years of NASA&#x27;s Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

In 1972, two years after &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; was canceled, Daily was back on television in a non-military aviator&#x27;s uniform, as Howard Borden in &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. Borden, a commercial airline navigator who later becomes a co-pilot, lives across the hall from Bob Newhart&#x27;s Bob Hartley character. He frequently pops into the Hartleys&#x27; apartment to borrow things, mooch a meal, or have the Hartleys take care of his visiting son.

===Mid-1970s to 1990s===
Daily appeared as an occasional panelist on the 1970s CBS game show &quot;Match Game&quot;. After regular Richard Dawson&#x27;s departure in 1978, Daily was a semi-regular for the final three years of the show&#x27;s CBS and syndicated run.

For the two years that followed &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, Daily returned to stand-up. In 1980, after years of making a living as a second banana, Daily was offered his own show. Called &quot;Small &amp; Frye&quot;, the program featured Daily as a neurotic doctor; it lasted for only three months before being canceled. Daily, a lifelong lover of magic, made three syndicated TV specials introducing young magicians, called &quot;Bill Daily&#x27;s Hocus-Pocus Gang&quot;, broadcast in 1982 and 1983.

In 1987, Daily was named director of the New Mexico Film Commission.

In 1988, Daily tried his hand again at starring roles, this time as another doctor on the sitcom &quot;Starting From Scratch&quot;. The show fared slightly better than &quot;Frye&quot;, but was canceled after one season. Daily&#x27;s most notable post-&quot;Newhart&quot; role was another supporting character, that of Larry the psychiatrist on &quot;ALF&quot; (1986). Jack Riley appeared as an unnamed patient, clearly reprising Elliot Carlin from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. ALF claimed to have learned all he knew about psychology from watching the earlier series.

Daily twice reprised his &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; role of Roger Healey in two made-for-TV reunion movies: &quot;I Dream of Jeannie... Fifteen Years Later&quot; (1985) and &quot;I Still Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1991). In 1990, Daily reunited with Bob Newhart as a new, overbearing neighbor in the &quot;Newhart&quot; episode &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot;. Also in 1991, he reprised the role of Howard Borden in &quot;The Bob Newhart Show: The 19th Anniversary Special&quot;, broadcast on CBS in November of that year. In 1997, he was a guest star on &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;.

Although mostly retired, Daily occasionally made some live comedy and television guest appearances into the 2000s. From 2006 to February 2009, he was a guest host on radio station KBQI in Albuquerque.

==Personal life and death==
Daily married his first wife, Patricia Anderson, in 1949; in 1976, the couple divorced. Daily had two adopted children: a son, Patrick, and a daughter, Kimberley, who is deceased. In 1980, he married Vivian Sanchez, with whom he traveled on the road, performing &quot;Lover&#x27;s Leap&quot; for two years. He and Sanchez later divorced.

In 1993, Daily married his third wife, Becky. The couple remained together until her death in 2010. His manager and publicist was Patterson Lundquist.

Daily died of natural causes on September 4, 2018, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, four days after his 91st birthday. His death was announced by his family three days later and his ashes were scattered nearby.

<text>Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) is the public body responsible for co-ordinating transport services in the West Midlands metropolitan county in England. It is an executive body of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), with bus franchising and highway management powers similar to Transport for London. TfWM&#x27;s policies and strategy are set by the Transport Delivery Committee of the WMCA.

TfWM&#x27;s initial priorities upon its establishment in 2016 were the expansion of the West Midlands Metro through East Birmingham, Brierley Hill and Birmingham Airport, improvements to the M5 and M6 motorways, and new cycle routes as part of a metropolitan cycle network. There are also plans to work with central government over the future of the underused M6 Toll.

== History ==
Before 2016, public transport services in the West Midlands were co-ordinated by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, which adopted the brand Centro in 1990. Centro&#x27;s policies were set by the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority (WMITA). TfWM absorbed the functions, responsibilities, assets and staff of both of these organisations in June 2016, and the predecessor organisations were dissolved.

== Governance ==

The WMCA&#x27;s Transport Delivery Committee is a 19-member sub-committee of the Combined Authority Board. It forms part of TfWM&#x27;s activities, and provides oversight of the operational delivery of transport across the West Midlands and advises the Combined Authority Board, through the Transport Portfolio Holder, on transport policy matters. The members are nominated by their respective 
local authorities; Birmingham City Council nominating seven members, the six other Metropolitan Boroughs nominating two members each. Each member has a single vote. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Transport Delivery Committee are appointed by the Combined Authority Board.

==Responsibilities==

The WMCA is the Local Transport Authority and has a statutory responsibility to implement policies and strategies that co-ordinate and promote the use of public transport in the West Midlands. The WMCA&#x27;s transport responsibilities include:

=== Strategy ===

*Setting and monitoring the authority&#x27;s transport budget, determining the grants to be made to passenger transport companies, and determining the borrowing limits of the Combined Authority in relation to transport matters.
* The allocation and prioritisation of central government grants and other forms of funding.
* Long-term strategy for the West Midlands transport system, contributing to regional economic development through a network of high-volume public transport corridors.
*Constructing and maintaining public transport infrastructure (bus, Metro stations, for example).
*Working with public transport operators, the police, and district councils for the promotion of safe, efficient, and economic transport facilities and services.
*Providing integration between public transport modes, including the provision of interchanges.
*Promoting and publicising the public transport network and providing travel information.

=== Rail/Light Rail ===

* Developing a rapid transit network, including West Midlands Metro and the Coventry Very Light Rail.
* Developing the rail network in partnership with Network Rail and train operating companies, and formulating policies regarding a devolved rail franchise from October 2017.
* Maximising the benefits of HS2 across the West Midlands region.

=== Bus ===

* Considering and approving the creation and development of Bus Quality Contract Schemes
*Increasing bus travel, and supporting the modernisation of the bus network in the region with the West Midlands Bus Alliance.
*Subsidising socially necessary but commercially non-viable bus services.
*Franchising bus services, if deemed necessary to improve passenger services.

=== Ticketing and Fares ===

* Operating a concessionary fares scheme and implementing the government&#x27;s National Concessionary Scheme.
* Integrated ticketing and developing smartcard ticketing technology within the region.
* Providing an annual grant to the operator of the door-to-door &quot;Ring and Ride&quot; service for people who have difficulty using other public transport facilities. (Currently this is operated by Accessible Transport, part of National Express West Midlands.)

=== Highways ===

* Management of the West Midlands Key Route Network (WM-KRN) on behalf of the metropolitan boroughs and the mayor.
*Create and promote an effective freight strategy throughout the metropolitan area.

==Branding==
Network West Midlands was the brand used by TfWM when it assumed responsibility for public transport from Centro in 2016. In 2018, the system was rebranded as &quot;West Midlands Network,&quot; with a diamond motif designed to emulate the success of the Transport for London roundel. The identity uses LL Circular by Lineto as the primary typeface, replacing the Network typeface that was previously used. All public transport infrastructure will carry the identity, with signage and liveries being replaced on a rolling basis.

In 2021, it was announced that the &quot;West Midlands Network&quot; moniker would be dropped, leaving &quot;Transport for West Midlands&quot; as the public-facing brand.

==Key projects==
=== Coventry Very Light Rail ===

A new tram system in Coventry, Coventry Very Light Rail, is planned to open by 2026, with a network of 4-6 lines open by 2040. The first vehicle left the assembly line in March 2021 and was taken on a showcase in the city before being taken to Dudley for testing.

===High-speed rail===

In August 2009, TfWM&#x27;s predecessor, Centro, backed construction of a new railway in the West Midlands region for use by High Speed 2 trains, which would allow existing lines to have &quot;better and more frequent local services&quot;.

===Sprint bus network===

Sprint is a bus rapid transit scheme under construction between Walsall, Birmingham and Solihull. Further routes are planned across the region.

=== West Midlands Bus ===

On 19 August 2018 National Express West Midlands and Diamond launched a joint timetable on services 42 West Bromwich to Tipton/Dudley and 43 West Bromwich to Bilston and 31 Mossley to Walsall 32 Lower Farm to Walsall, with National Express and Diamond buses repainted in red liveries carrying West Midlands Bus route branding.

From 15 March 2020 National Express West Midlands and Diamond launched a joint timetable on services 40 West Bromwich to Wednesbury via Friar Park.

In August 2021, Diamond announced that they would cease running joint timetables on partnership services (withdrawing completely from service 32) and no longer serve Dudley on service 42, citing loss of revenue due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.

On 5 December 2021 the partnership was back on for services 31/32; 42/43 and 40.

In July 2024, it was reported that the Mayor of the West Midlands, Richard Parker, believed that buses within the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) area could be under public control from 2027. A final decision could be made by March 2025, after an independent audit and public consultation.

===West Midlands Cycle Hire===
As part of the &quot;Starley Network&quot; Scheme across the West Midlands, a new transport mode by Transport for West Midlands was unveiled: West Midlands Cycle Hire (also known informally as West Midlands Cycle). As part of this a &quot;West Midlands Walking and Cycling Commissioner&quot; was appointed, Adam Tranter, whose job is to encourage Cycling and Walking as not just an activity, but a mode of transport. Projects to help this include things such as Birmingham&#x27;s planned 200 km Dutch Cycling Network, Coventry&#x27;s Starley Network of multiple safe, dutch style cycleways, and a new Cycle Hire Scheme.

In March 2021, Cycle Hire Docking Stations started to appear across the West Midlands, in Coventry, Birmingham, Dudley, Wolverhampton and Sutton Coldfield. Bikes can be hired for as long as you like and the cost of travel is often less than the equivalent bus journey. The scheme has been successful with 200,000 journeys taken in its first year and was expanded to areas such as Warwick University and Selly Oak.

However, in March 2024 it was reported that hundreds of the cycle hire bikes had gone missing or been vandalised. The cost for vandalism and repairs was £316,000.

=== West Midlands Metro ===
TfWM&#x27;s predecessor, Centro, was responsible for the reintroduction of tram services to the West Midlands, with the development of the Midland Metro, now known as West Midlands Metro. Plans for a multi-line light rail system for the West Midlands were first drawn up in the early 1980s. The first (and so far only) line of the Midland Metro was opened in May 1999 between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The line&#x27;s first extension into the streets of Birmingham city centre, from its original terminus at Birmingham Snow Hill to Grand Central opened in May 2016. 2 Lines are currently under construction in Dudley and Brierley Hill with of new track and work on another to serve Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (a High Speed 2 station), Digbeth has begun. Over £1bn of funding for a further 3 lines has been received to serve the areas of Walsall, Stourbridge &amp; Halesowen.
===Railway line and station reopenings===
TFWM has been active in promoting the restoration of passenger services to both the Camp Hill line and the Walsall to Wolverhampton Line, with five new stations opening or reopening, including , and stations on the Camp Hill line, and and stations on the Walsall-Wolverhampton route. All were planned to be opened by the end of 2023. However due to cost overruns as of November 2024 none of the planned new stations have opened.

==Ticketing==
TfWM is committed to the introduction of an integrated ticketing system. &quot;n&quot; branded tickets are valid across the entire network, on any operator within the TfWM area.

nBus tickets are valid on almost all operators&#x27; services in the West Midlands county. Tickets can be purchased for travel within various local travel areas or across the whole of the county, and are valid for periods ranging from one day to a year. Metro travel may be added onto nBus passes.

nTrain passes are valid on all local train services within the Network West Midlands zonal rail map (including Hednesford), or to select out-of-county stations in the Birmingham travel-to-work metropolitan area.

Swift is the multi-modal, multi-operator smart travel card, similar to the Oyster card scheme in London. Rather than being a single card, it is a range of contactless passes and cards that share a common system and brand name. Centro began a phased rollout of the Swift card scheme in 2012, which was still ongoing in 2016 when responsibility for the scheme passed to TfWM. The system is expected to be extended across the local rail network as part of rail devolution in the West Midlands.

<text>The Hunting Island Light is located in Hunting Island State Park on Hunting Island near Beaufort, South Carolina. Although no longer used as a functioning lighthouse, the tower is a fixture at the state park and is open to visitors. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

==Overview==
The tower is made mostly of brick with a cast-iron shell. The conical tower is and had a second-order Fresnel. The original lamp, clockwork movement and the Fresnel lens was removed when it was decommissioned in 1933. The 1st order lens from the Morris island lighthouse is at base of the tower for the public to view. The top third of the tower is painted black and the lower two-thirds is painted white. A fog horn was not installed.

Currently, an LED lamp is in place flashing the original flash pattern from 1859 in the lighthouse. It is turned on at dusk and flashes through the night providing night visitors to the island the feel of an operating lighthouse. When operational, the Hunting Island Lighthouse was visible for 17 miles. Historic records from March 1890 note that the lighthouse was complete, &quot;including one of the larger sized fire proof oil light houses.&quot;

==History==
Construction started in 1859, but was set back as the tower was destroyed during the Civil War in 1862. Major George H. Elliot is credited with the 1860s development of what is known as the &quot;segmented cast-iron&quot; lighthouse design. In the United States, two were constructed: the Hunting Island Lighthouse and subsequently Florida&#x27;s Cape Canaveral Light. Hunting Island&#x27;s Lighthouse was designed to be disassembled and moved if required. It consists of cast-iron sections, each weighing up to 1200 pounds which are bolted together to form the shell. the shell is lined with brick, which constitutes the main load-bearing structural element.

Erection commenced in 1873 and was completed in 1875. With its 167 steps that lead to an impressive observation deck, the Hunting Island Lighthouse has a handsomely built cast and wrought-iron staircase, railings and support beams that were fashioned by the Phoenix Iron Works company of Philadelphia. The Lighthouse was first located on the northern portion of Hunting Island, South Carolina, but severe beach erosion threatened the light station and its structures. By 1888 it was reported that the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s high tide had reached within 35 feet of the keeper&#x27;s house. As a result, the lighthouse, the keeper&#x27;s home and two other structures were relocated a mile away in 1889 to their present locale.

At the time of the 1893 Sea Islands Hurricane, the Hunting Island Lighthouse functioned as a sanctuary for some passengers aboard the steamer &quot;City of Savannah I&quot; which had been forced onto the shoals. The Lighthouse continued operation until deactivation in 1933. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as reference #70000561. In 2009, celebrations were held in honor of the lighthouse&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

==Maintenance==
As part of Hunting Island State Park, the tower remains open to the public. Continued remodeling of the tower is made possible by South Carolina funding and a small charge per visitor to the tower.

In 2003 the lighthouse was closed for an 18-month period after rust had compromised the structural integrity of several of its cast-iron stairs. Repairs lasted for over 18 months, and included fixing cracked stairs, as well as the installation of steel brace reinforcements. The silvery-grayish braces stand in stark contrast to the black cast-iron stairs, which in turn allows visitors to distinguish between the original structural components and the more-recent modifications aimed at protecting the lighthouse&#x27;s historic integrity.

In 2019, engineering studies concluded that $3 million in repairs were needed to the lighthouse, particularly to repair cracks and corrosion due to weather. Part of the repairs may include the disassembly and potential relocation of the lighthouse further inland, similar to actions taken in 1889. As of January 2023 the lighthouse has been closed for repair and will reopen in 2025.

<doc id="1124901" wikidata="Q955223" url="?curid=1124901" title="Tianxia">
<text>Tianxia, &#x27;all under Heaven&#x27;, is a Chinese term for a historical Chinese cultural concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In ancient China and imperial China, &quot;tianxia&quot; denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Chinese sovereign by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Chinese court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Chinese court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common subjects, tributary states, and finally ending with fringe barbarians.

The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese &quot;tianxia&quot;. In classical Chinese political thought, the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, having received the Mandate of Heaven, would nominally be the ruler of the entire world. Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Chinese monarch, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Chinese monarch.

The larger concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; is closely associated with civilization and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the world view of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. &quot;Tianxia&quot; has been applied by other realms in the Sinosphere.

== Historical development ==

The historical consensus is that a &quot;tianxia&quot; system existed at various points in Chinese history. Historical views differ, however, on exactly when it was in place. How a system of &quot;tianxia&quot; operated varied over time, ranging from vassal states accepted the authority of a Chinese emperor to when vassal states nominally paid tribute while in fact exercising their own authority. In the most expansive historical view, a &quot;tianxia&quot; system existed between the Zhou (1027–256 BC) and Qing dynasties (1644–1911).

According to political scientist Yan Xuetong of Tsinghua University, &quot;Given the then lack of a modern science of understanding geography, the Chinese notion of all under heaven meant all the land, sea, and people under heaven. The term all under heaven was virtually synonymous with the world.&quot; As reconstructed by philosopher Zhao Tingyang, &quot;tianxia&quot; presupposed &quot;inclusion of all&quot; and implied acceptance of the world&#x27;s diversities, emphasizing harmonious reciprocal dependence and ruled by virtue as a means for lasting peace. According to Zhao, in the &quot;tianxia&quot; system, rulers relied on humane authority, as opposed to tyranny and military force, to win the hearts and minds of the people.

The &quot;tianxia&quot; world view was not fully developed during the Shang dynasty. During the Zhou dynasty, it is first attested that Heaven took on anthropomorphic deity traits, and the concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; became common. Other political terms emerged during this time. These include —referring to the territory established by the Zhou court and governed from the capital—and , referring to both the territory as well as the Hua and barbarian subjects residing on it. The Zhou kings received and empowered these &quot;Ten Thousand States&quot; by virtue of the Mandate of Heaven.

During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods comprising the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of local rulers developed rapidly, and several regions outside the Zhou cultural sphere became powerful states themselves. As many of these states had shared cultural heritage and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the Yellow River Plain gradually expanded. The term &quot;tianxia&quot; began to appear in classical texts such as the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; and &quot;Guoyu&quot;.

The theme of unification applied to &quot;tianxia&quot; can be seen in Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer:

During Qin&#x27;s wars of unification, the concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity. Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s goal to &#x27;unify all under Heaven&#x27; was in fact representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the Han dynasty, the equivalence of &quot;tianxia&quot; with the Chinese nation evolved due to the practice of enfeoffment of imperial relatives in return for military assistance. Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory. Scholars including Dong Zhongshu sought to standardize the meaning of &quot;tianxia&quot;. Dong described &quot;tianxia&quot; as a world order in three concentric layers: &quot;The nation is on the inside and the various feudal kingdoms are on the outside; the feudal kingdoms are on the inside while the barbarians are on the outside.&quot;

Unified China fractured into many different dynasties during the Northern and Southern period, and with it went the practical use of the term &quot;tianxia&quot;. In the 7th century during the Tang dynasty, some northern tribes of Turkic origin, after being made vassal, referred to Emperor Taizong as the &quot;Khan of Heaven&quot;.

By the time of the Song dynasty, northern China was ruled by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, and the Tangut-led Western Xia dynasty. After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations. The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty divided Chinese subjects into two types: those of the south, and those of the north. When the Ming dynasty overthrew the Yuan dynasty and reunited China under ethnic Han rule, the concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty.

At the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of Neo-Confucianism and its mantras of &#x27;cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing &quot;tianxia&quot;″, a quote from the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, became widespread, producing large shifts in Confucianism. The philosopher Wang Fuzhi believed that &quot;tianxia&quot; was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning&#x27;s mentioning of harmonizing &quot;tianxia&quot; was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism. On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty by the, people previously considered &quot;fringe barbarians&quot;, heavily influenced people&#x27;s views of &quot;tianxia&quot;. Gu Yanwu, a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of &quot;tianxia&quot;. He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the &quot;tianxia&quot; of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on.

The idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of &quot;tianxia&quot; by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with George Macartney&#x27;s embassy to China in 1793. George Macartney hoped to deal with China as Great Britain would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to reduce restrictions on trade. The Qianlong Emperor rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods. In the early 19th century, Britain&#x27;s victory over Qing China in the First Opium War forced China to sign an unequal treaty. This marked the beginning of the end for the &quot;tianxia&quot; concept.

Following their defeat in the Second Opium War, China was forced to sign the Treaty of Tianjin, in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a &quot;sovereign nation&quot;, equal to itself. This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional &quot;tianxia&quot; system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau.

Due to the liberal international order arguably being based on Westphalian sovereignty, the idea that sovereign nations deal with each other as equals, China&#x27;s traditional &quot;tianxia&quot; worldview collapsed. After China&#x27;s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese terminated Korea&#x27;s traditional status as a tributary state of China, and the system of feudal enfeoffment and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the &quot;tianxia&quot; concept. At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Xue Fucheng took the traditional Hua-Yi distinction in the &quot;tianxia&quot; world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction.

In the 21st century, some academics have criticized contemporary philosopher Zhao Tingyang for &quot;aggrandising&quot; the concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; and being vague on details of what it may entail in the contemporary world.

==Usage in the Sinosphere==
=== Korea ===
Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, Goguryeo had concepts of Son of Heaven () and independent &quot;tianxia&quot;. The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven, and positioned Goryeo at the center of the &#x27;east of the sea&#x27;, which encompassed the historical domain of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

During the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or &quot;Little China&quot; emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.

=== Contemporary China ===
Chinese state media frequently portrays general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as having the &quot;tianxia&quot; perspective to seek &quot;rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and peaceful development of humanity&quot;. Under this contemporary view, China&#x27;s re-emergence as a great power presents an opportunity to reshape the liberal international order into a hub-and-spoke pattern around a single, central state. In this contemporary discourse on &quot;tianxia&quot;, proponents argue that &quot;tianxia&quot;″s moral appeal distinguishes it from &quot;realpolitik&quot;, which they submit as creating discord. Similarly, this modern treatment toward &quot;tianxia&quot; purports to be superior to the United Nations system, which is characterized as more akin to a political market, in which political operations are limited and constrained by parochial national interests. Historian Steve Tsang states that the concept of Community of Common Destiny presumes a vision of &quot;tianxia&quot; over and above the liberal international order.

Applying the &quot;tianxia&quot; system to a modern framework, Chinese political scientist Yan Xuetong argues that great powers seeking international respect must use &quot;humane authority&quot; instead of seeking to impose hegemony. These concepts influence the Chinese school of international relations.

Various academics have noted that the current discourse of &quot;tianxia&quot; has been produced for domestic consumption and risks alienating foreigners. Danish academics Klaas Dykmann and Ole Bruun state, &quot;[f]oreign observers, particularly in democratic societies, will further note the glaring inconsistencies between the “harmonious world” conception and the tough realities of the domestic harmonious society, and between China&#x27;s global media outreach and its increasing domestic control, digital surveillance, blacklisting, and media isolation of the Chinese public.&quot;

== Western calques ==
The expression &#x27;all under heaven&#x27; inspired literary expressions with reference to China in a number of Western languages, such as the Russian . The English term &quot;Celestial Empire&quot; is possibly derived from the title &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;.

== Other usage ==
In 2013, the Singaporean historian Wang Gungwu coined the term &quot;American &quot;Tianxia&quot;&quot; to refer to the contemporary world order led by the United States.

<text>Pirassununga is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil, with an altitude of 627 meters. The population is 76,877 (2020 est.) in an area of 727 km2.

Situated in the southeast region of Brazil, the city is home to many important institutions, one being the Brazilian Air Force Academy. All current and future officers of the Brazilian Air Force are trained here. Pirassununga is also home to Fort Anhaguera, which once hosted the 13th Mechanized Cavalry Regiment of the Brazilian army.

In addition to being an important region for the Brazilian military, Pirassununga is a hub for the agriculture and environmental sciences of Brazil. The University of São Paulo&#x27;s Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos (FZEA), which translates to the College of Animal Science and Food Engineering, is located in the city. Pirassununga is also the location of CEPTA, the National Research and Conservation Center of Continental Aquatic Biodiversity, which is associated with the Chico Mendes Institute, an important research and conservation center in Brasília, the capital of Brazil.

== History ==

Pirassununga was originally home to the Tupi people, an indigenous group in Brazil. They gave the city its name, which means &quot;the sound of fish.&quot; Every December, the fish migrate upstream, causing loud sounds as they fight against the current.

== Exports ==

=== Cachaça ===
Pirassununga is home to three sugar cane distilleries, Pirassununga 51 Cachaça, Cachaça Sapucaia and Pirassununga Cachaça. The most popular brand, Pirassununga 51 Cachaça, was founded in 1959, just one year after Brazil had won its first FIFA Soccer World Cup. Pirassununga 51 Cachaça became a household name in the country during the 70s. &quot;51, uma boa ideia,&quot; which translates to &quot;51, a good idea,&quot; soon became a phrase in popular culture. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1990s that Pirassununga 51 Cachaça became an export to other parts of the world. Cachaça is used as the spirit of choice for Brazil&#x27;s national cocktail, the caipirinha.

== Tourist Spots ==

<text>The Mk/B53 was a high-yield bunker buster thermonuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. Deployed on Strategic Air Command bombers, the B53, with a yield of 9 megatons, was the most powerful weapon in the U.S. nuclear arsenal after the last B41 nuclear bombs were retired in 1976.

The B53 was the basis of the W-53 warhead carried by the Titan II missile, which was decommissioned in 1987. Although not in active service for many years before 2010, fifty B53s were retained during that time as part of the &quot;hedge&quot; portion of the Enduring Stockpile until its complete dismantling in 2011. The last B53 was disassembled on 25 October 2011, a year ahead of schedule.

With its retirement, the largest bomb currently in service in the U.S. nuclear arsenal is the B83, with a maximum yield of 1.2 megatons. The B53 was replaced in the bunker-busting role by the B61 Mod 11.

==History==

Development of the weapon began in 1955 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, based on the earlier Mk 21 and Mk 46 weapons. In March 1958 the Strategic Air Command issued a request for a new Class C (less than five tons, megaton-range) bomb to replace the earlier Mk 41. A revised version of the Mk 46 became the TX-53 in 1959. The development TX-53 warhead was apparently never tested, although an experimental TX-46 predecessor design was detonated 28 June 1958 as Hardtack Oak, which detonated at a yield of 8.9 Megatons.

The Mk 53 entered production in 1962 and was built through June 1965. About 340 bombs were built. It entered service aboard B-47 Stratojet, B-52G Stratofortress, and B-58 Hustler bomber aircraft in the mid-1960s. From 1968 it was redesignated B53.

Some early versions of the bomb were dismantled beginning in 1967. After the Titan II program ended, the remaining W-53s were retired in the late 1980s. The B53 was retired in 1986, but in 1988 50 units were brought back into service and received the B53 Mod 1 safety upgrade so the air force could cover certain targets previously covered by Titan II. These weapons remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources. In 2010 authorization was given to disassemble the 50 bombs at the Pantex plant in Texas. The process of dismantling the last remaining B53 bomb in the stockpile was completed in 2011.

==Specifications==
The B53 was long with a diameter of . It weighed , including the W53 warhead, the parachute system and the honeycomb aluminum nose cone to enable the bomb to survive laydown delivery. It had five parachutes: one pilot chute, one extractor chute, and three main chutes. Chute deployment depends on delivery mode, with the main chutes used only for laydown delivery. For free-fall delivery, the entire system was jettisoned.

The W53 warhead of the B53 used oralloy (highly enriched uranium) instead of plutonium for fission, with a mix of lithium-6 deuteride fuel for fusion. The explosive lens comprised a mixture of RDX and TNT, which was not insensitive. Two variants were made: the B53-Y1, a &quot;dirty&quot; weapon using a U-238-encased secondary, and the B53-Y2 &quot;clean&quot; version with a non-fissile (lead or tungsten) secondary casing. The explosive yield for the Y1 version was declassified in 2014 as being 9 Mt.

In 1988, some B53s were upgraded to the B53 Mod 1 (B53-1) variant to improve weapon safety and to provide compatibility with the G/H variants of the B52 bomber. During this upgrade the weapon lost full-fuzing capability, retaining only the laydown fuzing mode. The B53-1 had a selectable laydown time of 30 to 240 seconds in 30 second increments.

==Role==
It was intended as a bunker buster weapon, using a surface blast after laydown deployment to transmit a shock wave through the earth to collapse its target. Attacks against the Soviet deep underground leadership shelters in the Chekhov/Sharapovo area south of Moscow envisaged multiple B53/W53 exploding at ground level. It has since been supplanted in such roles by the earth-penetrating B61 Mod 11, a bomb that penetrates the surface to deliver much more of its explosive energy into the ground, and therefore needs a much smaller yield to produce the same effects.

The B53 was intended to be retired in the 1980s, but 50 units remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources. The last remaining B53 bomb began the disassembly processes on Tuesday, 25 October 2011 at the Energy Department&#x27;s Pantex Plant.

An April 2014 GAO report notes that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is retaining canned sub-assemblies (CSAs) &quot;associated with a certain warhead indicated as excess in the 2012 Production and Planning Directive are being retained in an indeterminate state pending a senior-level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids.&quot; In its FY2015 budget request, the NNSA noted that the B53 component disassembly was &quot;delayed&quot;, leading some observers to conclude they might be the warhead CSAs being retained for potential planetary defense purposes.

==W-53==

The W-53 nuclear warhead of the Titan II ICBM used the same physics package as the B53, without the air drop-specific components like the parachute system and crushable structures in the nose and sides needed for lay-down delivery, reducing its mass to about . The Mark-6 re-entry vehicle containing the W53 warhead was about long, in diameter and was mounted atop a spacer which was in diameter at the missile interface (compared to the missile&#x27;s core diameter of ). With a yield of 9 megatons, it was the highest yield warhead ever deployed on a US missile. About 65 W53 warheads were constructed between December 1962 and December 1963.

On 19 September 1980 a fuel leak caused a Titan II to explode within its silo in Arkansas, throwing the W53 warhead some distance away. Due to the safety measures built into the weapon, it did not explode or release any radioactive material. Fifty-two active missiles were deployed in silos prior to the beginning of the retirement program in October 1982.

==Effects==

Assuming a detonation at optimum height, a 9-megaton blast would result in a fireball with an approximate diameter. The radiated heat would be sufficient to cause lethal burns to any unprotected person within a radius (). Blast effects would be sufficient to collapse most residential and industrial structures within a radius (); within () virtually all above-ground structures would be destroyed and blast effects would inflict near 100% fatalities. Within a 500-rem (5-sievert) dose of ionizing radiation would be received by the average person, sufficient to cause a 50% to 90% casualty rate independent of thermal or blast effects at this distance.

==Accidents==
* January 13, 1964 -1964 Savage Mountain B-52 crash (involved two B53-0 Y1 bombs being shipped in ferry configuration)
* December 8, 1964 - USAF B-58 aircraft carrying a B53 nuclear bomb internally, and four B43 nuclear bombs externally, caught fire while taxiing after its landing gear collapsed. The B53 burned, causing contamination of the crash area. Two of the B43s caused some plutonium and uranium contamination.
* September 18–19, 1980 - 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion (involved a Titan II missile with a W-53 warhead)

<doc id="1124947" wikidata="Q2923585" url="?curid=1124947" title="BrainGate">
<text>BrainGate is a brain implant system, currently under development and in clinical trials, designed to help those who have lost control of their limbs, or other bodily functions, such as patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or spinal cord injury. The Braingate technology and related Cyberkinetic’s assets are now owned by privately held Braingate, Co. The sensor, which is implanted into the brain, monitors brain activity in the patient and converts the intention of the user into computer commands.

==Technology==
 
In its current form, BrainGate consists of a sensor implanted in the brain and an external decoder device, which connects to some kind of prosthetic or other external object. The sensor is in the form of a microelectrode array, formerly known as the Utah Array, which consists of 100 hair-thin electrodes that sense the electromagnetic signature of neurons firing in specific areas of the brain, for example, the area that controls arm movement. The sensor translates that activity into electrically charged signals, which are then sent to an external device and decoded in software. The decoder connects to and can use the brain signals to control an external device, such as a robotic arm, a computer cursor, or even a wheelchair. In essence, BrainGate allows a person to manipulate objects in the world using only the mind.
In addition to real-time analysis of neuron patterns to relay movement, the BrainGate array is also capable of recording electrical data for later analysis. A potential use of this feature would be for a neurologist to study seizure patterns in a patient with epilepsy.

== History ==
BrainGate was originally developed by researchers in the Department of Neuroscience at Brown University in conjunction with bio-tech company Cyberkinetics, Inc. Cyberkinetics later spun off the device manufacturing to Blackrock Microsystems, who now manufactures the sensors and the data acquisition hardware. The BrainGate Company purchased the intellectual property and related technology from Cyberkinetics and continues to own the intellectual property related to BrainGate.

=== Research and experimental results ===
The first reported experiments involving the implantation of the microelectrode array in one human subject were carried out in 2002 by Kevin Warwick, Mark Gasson and Peter Kyberd. The procedure, which was performed at the Radcliffe Infirmary, involved the implantation of the array in the peripheral nerves of the subject in order to successfully bring about both motor and sensory functionality, i.e. bi-directional signalling.
The subsequent full clinical trial of BrainGate was led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and ran from 2004 to 2006, involving the study of four patients with tetraplegia. The results, published in a 2006 article in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, showed that a human with tetraplegia was able to control a cursor on a computer screen just by thinking, enabling him to open emails, and to operate devices such as a television. One participant, Matt Nagle, had a spinal cord injury, while another had advanced ALS.
In July 2009, a second clinical trial, dubbed &quot;BrainGate2&quot;, was initiated by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University, and the Providence VA. In November 2011, researchers from the Stanford University Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory joined the trial as a second site. This trial is ongoing.
In May 2012, BrainGate researchers published a study in &quot;Nature&quot; demonstrating that two people paralyzed by brainstem stroke several years earlier were able to control robotic arms for reaching and grasping. One participant, Cathy Hutchinson, was able to use the arm to drink coffee from a bottle, the first time she was able to drink unaided in 15 years. This took place on site at The Boston Home in Dorchester, Massachusetts, a specialized residence where Ms. Hutchinson resided. The study included researchers at Brown University, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and the German Aerospace Center.

=== Current clinical trials ===
Clinical trials began in 2009 under the name &quot;BrainGate2 Neural Interface System&quot;. , Stanford University, Massachusetts General Hospital, Case Western Reserve University (Ohio) and Providence VA Medical Center were actively recruiting participants for the ongoing BrainGate2 clinical trial.

In April 2021, BrainGate became the first technology to transmit wireless commands from a human brain to a computer. The clinical study used two participants with spinal cord injuries. The study used a transmitter connected to the subject&#x27;s brain motor cortex to transmit the signals. The accuracy and speed of typing and movement was reported to be identical to that of wired solutions.

<doc id="1124950" wikidata="Q5237393" url="?curid=1124950" title="I Can't Stand Still">
<text>I Can&#x27;t Stand Still is the debut solo studio album by American musician Don Henley, drummer and co-lead vocalist for the Eagles. It was released in August 1982 by Asylum Records. Henley, Danny Kortchmar and Greg Ladanyi produced the album. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; achieved gold status, and peaked at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at the same position on the UK Albums Chart. Three singles were released from the album, including the hit &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became Henley&#x27;s best-selling single. The title track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; reached No. 48 and the track &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; reached No. 42 on the charts. 

The album showcased some of Henley&#x27;s frustrations at the time. &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; displays his disgust with the media and tabloid news coverage, and &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Read,&quot; shows his displeasure with the American educational system.

==Critical reception==
Robert Palmer, music critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; was surprised by &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; and wrote that it &quot;rings with the righteous indignation of a man who has taken a good look at what&#x27;s going on around him and decided at least to speak his mind about it...The record doesn&#x27;t offer any solutions, but how many pop records do? &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot; scores points for its palpable anger; for its lean, stripped-down arrangements; for the lack of self-indulgence in the playing, the production and Mr. Henley&#x27;s soaring vocals, and for its overall point of view, which links the disparate songs together and gives the album an admirable coherence. As far as this listener is concerned, it&#x27;s better than anything Mr. Henley did with the Eagles.&quot;

Reviewing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Mike DeGagne has written of the album, &quot;Henley&#x27;s first solo album may still have had the ghost of the Eagles lingering in the corners, but for the most part it showcases his stalwart partnership with producer and songwriter Danny Kortchmar,&quot; and then added &quot;Henley&#x27;s adept combination of lyrical wit and thought-provoking staidness begins to materialize on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still&quot;, paving the way for an extremely accomplished solo career.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the title track that &quot;using the same organ that made &quot;Laundry&quot; so unique, Henley weaves the chords through a ballad about a guy&#x27;s bitterness over his lost love&#x27;s new find.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; also said that it&#x27;s &quot;a slow, dramatic, organ-dominated tune that&#x27;s almost, but not quite, reggae&quot; and that Henley&#x27;s vocal tingles with a jealous edge as he sings of his lover&#x27;s &#x27;undercover&#x27; relationship.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;reggae California style, using heavy bass and syncopated organ for the rhythm track.&quot; AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne called it &quot;a trouble-in-paradise love song, [that] has Henley pouring his heart out with sugary angst, but is helped along with some avid keyboard work.&quot;

<text>The Battle of the Rice Boats, also called the Battle of Yamacraw Bluff, was a land and naval battle of the American Revolutionary War that took place in and around the Savannah River on the border between the Province of Georgia and the Province of South Carolina on March 2 and 3, 1776. The battle pitted the Patriot militia from Georgia and South Carolina against a small fleet of the Royal Navy.

In December 1775, the British Army was besieged in Boston. In need of provisions, a Royal Navy fleet was sent to Georgia to purchase rice and other supplies. The arrival of this fleet prompted the colonial rebels who controlled the Georgia government to arrest the British Royal Governor, James Wright, and to resist the British seizure and removal of supply ships anchored at Savannah. Some of the supply ships were burned to prevent their seizure, some were recaptured, but most were successfully taken by the British.

Governor Wright escaped from his confinement and safely reached one of the fleet&#x27;s ships. His departure marked the end of British control over Georgia, although it was briefly restored when Savannah was retaken by the British in 1778. Wright again ruled from 1779 to 1782, when British troops were finally withdrawn during the closing days of the war.

==Background==
In April 1775, tensions over British colonial policies in the Thirteen Colonies boiled over into war with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Following those events, Patriot colonists surrounded the city of Boston, placing it under siege, although the encirclement was incomplete: the city could be resupplied by sea. News of this action and the June Battle of Bunker Hill fanned the flames of independence throughout the colonies. Although the Province of Georgia had managed to remain relatively neutral before these events, radicals in the Georgia provincial congress came into power during the summer of 1775 and progressively stripped Georgia&#x27;s Royal Governor, James Wright, of his powers. While Wright had requested a naval presence near Savannah, the colony&#x27;s capital, Patriots in Charleston, South Carolina had intercepted his request and substituted for it a dispatch indicating he did not need such support.

The dispute in Georgia reached a crisis point when British men-of-war began arriving at Tybee Island in January 1776. On January 12, three ships were seen at anchor off Tybee Island; by January 18 the fleet consisted of , , , , and a number of smaller vessels. Wright&#x27;s opinion, expressed to Joseph Clay and others, was that the fleet had been sent to punish the local rebels. In fact, these ships were the beginnings of a fleet assembled to acquire provisions in Savannah for the beleaguered British troops in Boston. In December 1775 General William Howe had ordered an expedition to purchase rice and other provisions in Georgia. By early February the entire fleet had assembled off Tybee Island. It was under the overall command of Captain Andrew Barclay (or &quot;Barkley&quot;) on , and included and two transports, &quot;Whitby&quot; and &quot;Symmetry&quot;, carrying about 200 British army regulars from the 40th Foot under the command of Major James Grant.

The arrival of the first ships in January prompted the Georgia Committee of Safety to order the arrest of Wright and other provincial representatives of the Crown on January 18. Joseph Habersham, a major in the Georgia militia, placed Governor Wright under house arrest, and extracted a promise from the governor that he would not attempt to communicate with the British ships. Wright, who continued to be harassed in spite of his confinement, feared for his life, and escaped the mansion on the night of February 11. He made his way to the plantation of a Loyalist supporter and was taken from there to &quot;Scarborough&quot;. In the meantime, Georgia&#x27;s provincial assembly had met, elected representatives to the Second Continental Congress, and begun the process of raising regiments for the Continental Army.

After Governor Wright arrived aboard &quot;Scarborough&quot; he wrote a letter to the remaining members of his council, in which he expressed frustration over getting assurances of safety and access to the desired supplies from the Patriot authorities. Georgia had, along with the other twelve colonies, in 1774 adopted the terms of the Continental Association created by the First Continental Congress banning trade with Great Britain. With negotiations effectively failed, Barclay ordered his fleet into action on February 29. His objective was a number of merchant vessels docked at Savannah, whose owners were desirous of moving their goods, something that became possible on March 1 when the previous constraints expired.

==Battle==
On March 1, &quot;Scarborough&quot;, &quot;Tamar&quot;, &quot;Cherokee&quot;, and &quot;Hinchinbrook&quot; sailed up the Savannah River to Five-Fathom Hole, accompanying transports carrying two to three hundred men under Grant&#x27;s command. &quot;Hinchinbrook&quot; and one of the transports then sailed up the Back River. The transport anchored opposite the port area, while &quot;Hinchinbrook&quot;, in an attempt to take a position above the town, grounded on a sandbank in the river. Gunfire from Joseph Habersham&#x27;s militia cleared &quot;Hinchinbrook&quot; decks, but without suitable boats, Habersham was unable to attempt the taking of the vessel, which floated free on the next high tide. Late on the evening of March 2, Grant&#x27;s men were landed on Hutchinson Island. They made their way across the island, and, at 4:00 am on March 3, took over a number of the rice boats anchored near the island. Due to their success at remaining quiet, and possibly with the collusion of the ship captains, the alarm was not raised in Savannah until 9:00 am. The arrival of the ships on March 1 prompted the Committee of Safety to issue calls for the defense of the town and the ships, which were forwarded along with a request for assistance to South Carolina&#x27;s Committee of Safety the next day.

When the alarm was raised, Colonel McIntosh took 300 militiamen and set up three 4-pound cannons on Yamacraw Bluff. He then sent Lieutenant Daniel Roberts and Major Raymond Demeré II under a parley flag to one of the occupied ships; they were promptly arrested. When a second, larger, parley arrived to discuss the release of the two captives and the ships, the situation turned nasty when Captain Rogers, leader of the party, was insulted. After he fired at someone on the occupied ship, the British responded in kind, wounding one and very nearly sinking the parley group&#x27;s boat. Following that boat&#x27;s retreat, McIntosh opened fire with the cannons on the bluff, beginning a gunbattle that lasted for four hours.

The Committee of Safety, when it met to discuss the situation, decided that the supply ships should be burned, and a company of militia was assembled to accomplish this task. One supply ship, &quot;Inverness&quot;, was torched and set adrift toward the occupied vessels, causing a scramble as the British troops hurried to abandon them in the face of the arriving fire ship. During the confusion, the Patriot militia and battery were active, raking the scurrying British crews with musket fire and grape shot. Two of the occupied vessels managed to get away downstream, and two more escaped the flames by going upstream, but were forced to dock, and their crews were taken prisoner. Three ships succumbed to the flames, which burned well into the night. The action was assisted by the timely arrival of 500 South Carolina militia sent in response to the earlier appeal.

==Aftermath==
Colonel McIntosh sent a parley to Captain Barclay the next day, offering a prisoner exchange. When Barclay refused the exchange, the Committee of Safety ordered the arrest of the remaining members of Wright&#x27;s council. This move proved successful; the British-held prisoners were released in exchange for promises of protection of those councillors.

In spite of the action, the British successfully sailed most of the merchant ships down the Back River, although some of the ships needed to dump a portion of their cargo in order to make it down the shallow channel. Once they reached Tybee Island, the desired provisions, amounting to 1,600 barrels of rice, were loaded onto the two British transport ships.

The fleet remained anchored off Tybee Island while negotiations went on over the exchange of prisoners. During this time the fleet detained several arriving vessels, which were later disposed of as prizes. On March 25, a band of militia from Savannah burned all the houses on the island to deny their use to Wright and the ships&#x27; officers. Barclay weighed anchor on March 30 and sailed north, leading the convoy of merchant ships and transports. As the British had abandoned Boston earlier in March, he first put into Newport, Rhode Island, where the local Patriots denied him any assistance and fired at his ships using field artillery. He eventually rejoined the British forces at Halifax, Nova Scotia in May.

The battle and Wright&#x27;s departure marked the end of British control over Georgia until Savannah was recaptured by British forces in December 1778. Governor Wright returned, and Savannah then remained in British hands until 1782.

==Early life and family==
Thi was born in Bac Lieu on 7 May 1932, to a family of wealthy landowning farmers. Thi&#x27;s parents met through a matchmaker and married two years before he was born. Thi&#x27;s father came from a family of Cao Dai adherents while his mother was a Roman Catholic. His maternal grandfather was one of the richest Chinese landowners in Bac Lieu at the turn of the 20th century. His parents separated in 1937 after their fourth child was born, and his mother took their four children back down to her hometown in Tam Vu. After completing his primary education there, Thi was sent to Can Tho for his secondary education, where he enrolled into the Phan Thanh Gian College after passing through its tough entrance examinations.

He held the positions of Commander of the RVNAF Artillery Training Center, Commander of the Artillery in I Corps, Deputy Commander, RVNAF Artillery; Commander, 9th Infantry Division; and Commander of the Vietnamese National Military Academy. 

On 10 March 1972, he replaced Nguyễn Văn Hiếu as deputy commander of I Corps.

==Post-war life==
Lam fled with his family to the United States in May 1975, when South Vietnam fell to the invading North Vietnamese army. He lived in Fremont, California. Lam earned a French Baccalaureate Degree in Philosophy and an MBA, both from Golden Gate University in San Francisco. His son, Andrew Lam, is a writer and a journalist.

Lam was interviewed about the war in Ken Burns&#x27;s series &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;.

<doc id="1124989" wikidata="Q3343469" url="?curid=1124989" title="Norah Borges">
<text>Leonor Fanny &quot;Norah&quot; Borges Acevedo (March 4, 1901 – July 20, 1998), was an Argentine visual artist and art critic, member of the Florida group, and sister of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.

==Early life and source of nickname==
She was the daughter of a lawyer, Dr. Jorge Guillermo Borges and Leonor Acevedo Suárez. Leonor was given the name Norah by her older brother, Jorge Luis Borges. Of his sister, Jorge wrote:In all of our games she was always el caudillo, I the slow, timid, submissive one. She climbed to the top of the roof, traipsed through the trees, and I followed along with more fear than enthusiasm. —Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;Norah&quot;

Growing up, Norah lived in the shadow of her famous brother. It wasn&#x27;t until later in life that she emerged from her brother&#x27;s shadow and gained her own personal popularity. As a child, she moved with her family to Switzerland to treat the progressive blindness of her father. She studied with the classical sculptor Maurice Sarkisoff at the École des Beaux-Arts of Geneva. After three years of school, Norah was told by Professor Sarkisoff to leave the ways of the academy to grow in her individual style. In Lugano she studied with Arnaldo Bossi and was close to German expressionists such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. With Bossi, Borges learned the art of woodcutting and the aesthetics of expressionism.

==Early career==
In Switzerland, Borges wrote and illustrated her first poetry book, &quot;Notas lejanas&quot; (1915). After its publication, Borges and her family hoped to return to Argentina, but their stay in Europe was extended by four years because of the First World War. During this time, Borges saw much of Europe. First, she visited Provence and was so deeply impressed by Nîmes that she dedicated some of her later work to her travels there. After traveling through Provence, she moved to Spain, where she furthered her studies and participated in the Avant-Garde movement. In Spain, Borges first visited Barcelona, and then, in 1919, moved to Palma, Majorca. In Palma, she studied under Sven Westman and collaborated with her brother on the magazine &quot;Baleares&quot;.

Next she visited Sevilla, where she became a part of the vanguard of Ultraísmo, published her work in magazines like &quot;Grecia&quot; (1918-1920), &quot;Ultra&quot;, &quot;Tableros y Reflector&quot;, and in 1920 she illustrated the cover of &quot;El jardin de centauro&quot; (The Garden of the Centaur), a book of poems by Adriano del Valle. In the Spanish literary magazine, &quot;Grecia&quot;, she was asked to redesign the graphic design elements of four covers and a new header for their opening page at the age of eighteen. After leaving Sevilla, she passed through Granada and then finally came to Madrid, where she studied with the painter Julio Romero de Torres. Here she befriended the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez. She illustrated a number of his books and dedicated a portrait to him in her book &quot;Españoles de tres mundos&quot;.

In March 1921, Borges returned by boat to Buenos Aires. As a young painter, she aligned herself with the vanguard artists of the Florida group. Her work in &quot;Prisma&quot; (1921) reflects the ultraist (anti-modernist) ideas of the group, but her illustrations for magazines such as &quot;Mural&quot;, &quot;Proa&quot; (1924-1926) and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, and her illustrations in the first edition of the poetry book &quot;Fervor de Buenos Aires&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges (1923) reveal the influence of the Cubism that she had begun to assimilate with her French contacts in Spain. In 1923, the French surrealist magazine &quot;Manomètre&quot;, and, in 1924, &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; published her paintings. In the September-October 1924 issue of &quot;Martin Fierro&quot;, Borges&#x27; first collection of poems called &quot;Calle de la tarde&quot; were displayed. Also in 1924, Borges created a woodcut cover for the Mexican journal, &quot;Antena&quot;. Two years later, two of her illustrations were in the magazine &quot;Amauta&quot;. When creating for &quot;Amauta&quot;, she was working underneath José Carlos Mariátegui, who used illustration as a tool to help women artists in Latin American advertise their artwork.

In 1926, she displayed 75 works (oils, woodcarvings, drawings, water-colorings, and tapestries) in the &quot;Asociación Amigos del Arte&quot; exhibition. In 1928, she married the writer and art critic Guillermo de Torre, a student of the Ultraist movement and an expert on Avant-Garde art and literature, whom she had met in Spain when she was 19 years old. They had two children.

In the Second World War, she became a vocal supporter of Junta de la Victoria, an association of anti-fascist feminists in Argentina directed by Cora Ratto de Sadosky and Ana Rosa Schlieper de Martínez Guerrero. Also included in the group were the writer María Rosa Oliver, the photographer Annemarie Heinrich, the psychoanalyst Mimí Langer, the artist Raquel Forner, and the poet Silvina Ocampo.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Norah spent one month with her mother Leo Acevedo in a women&#x27;s prison for uttering cries against the president of Argentina Juan Perón, deepening the aversion that her brother felt for the Argentine political party Partido Justicialista and its founder Perón. After her release, Norah illustrated her brother&#x27;s book &quot;Cuaderno San Martin&quot;, as she had done with his earlier works like &quot;Luna de enfrente&quot; and &quot;Fervor de Buenos Aires&quot;, and &quot;Las invitadas&quot; (1961) and &quot;Autobiografia de Irene&quot; (1962) by Silvina Ocampo.
Norah wrote as an art critic for &quot;Anales de Buenos Aires&quot; under the pseudonym Manuel Pinedo. She worked as a journalist and painter until her death in 1998, but she gave away much of her work and did not care for regular art exhibitions.

Norah&#x27;s arrest was odd because her paintings didn&#x27;t seem to have any political context before. She wasn&#x27;t very vocal about her political views even with the arrest and her association to the Sur. She even refused to make statements about her political views. Norah&#x27;s protest and imprisonment were eventually represented in her art such as her painting, &quot;Recuerdos de la prisión&quot; (1948-1949). Her later paintings were considered to be more &quot;female-centered&quot;.

In 1942, a version of &quot;Platero y yo&quot; by Juan Ramón Jiménez was published with illustrations and vignettes by Norah. She also worked as a graphic artist on other books by Spanish emigrants in Argentina, including Ramón Gómez de la Serna, Rafael Alberti and León Felipe and illustrated the works of her brother and other Argentine writers like Victoria Ocampo, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Norah Lange and Julio Cortázar. She designed the scenery of a play by Federico García Lorca using the techniques of oil, watercolor, engraving, woodcut, and drawings in ink and pencil.

==Death and burial==
She died in Buenos Aires in 1998, aged 97, and was buried in the family vault in the La Recoleta Cemetery.

<doc id="1124997" wikidata="Q848369" url="?curid=1124997" title="Subconscious">
<text>In psychology, the subconscious is the part of the mind that is not currently of focal awareness. The term was already popularized in the early 20th century in areas ranging from psychology, religion and spirituality. The concept was heavily popularized by Joseph Murphy&#x27;s 1963 self-help book &quot;The Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot;.

==Scholarly use of the term==
The word &quot;subconscious&quot; represents an anglicized version of the French &quot;subconscient&quot; as coined by
John Norris, in &quot;An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World” (1708):
&quot;The immediate objects of Sense, are not the objects of Intellection, they being of a Subconscient [subconscious] nature.&quot; A more recent use was in 1889 by the psychologist Pierre Janet (1859–1947), in his doctorate of letters thesis, &quot;Of Psychological Automatism&quot; (. Janet argued that underneath the layers of critical-thought functions of the conscious mind lay a powerful awareness that he called the subconscious mind.

In the strict psychological sense, the adjective is defined as &quot;operating or existing outside of consciousness&quot;.

Locke and Kristof write that there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one&#x27;s knowledge and prior experience is needed, which they label the subconscious.

== Psychoanalysis ==
Sigmund Freud used the term &quot;subconscious&quot; in 1893 to describe associations and impulses that are not accessible to consciousness. He later abandoned the term in favor of unconscious, noting the following: 

In 1896, in Letter 52, Freud introduced the stratification of mental processes, noting that memory-traces are occasionally re-arranged in accordance with new circumstances. In this theory, he differentiated between &quot;Wahrnehmungszeichen&quot; (&quot;Indication of perception&quot;), &quot;Unbewusstsein&quot; (&quot;the unconscious&quot;) and &quot;Vorbewusstsein&quot; (&quot;the preconscious&quot;). From this point forward, Freud no longer used the term &quot;subconscious&quot; because, in his opinion, it failed to differentiate whether content and the processing occurred in the unconscious or preconscious mind.

Charles Rycroft explains that the subconscious is a term &quot;never used in psychoanalytic writings&quot;. Peter Gay says that the use of the term subconscious where unconscious is meant is &quot;a common and telling mistake&quot;; indeed, &quot;when [the term] is employed to say something &#x27;Freudian&#x27;, it is proof that the writer has not read [their] Freud&quot;.

== Analytical psychology ==

Carl Jung said that since there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one&#x27;s knowledge and prior experience is needed.

==&quot;New Age&quot; and other modalities targeting the subconscious==
The idea of the subconscious as a powerful or potent agency has allowed the term to become prominent in New Age and self-help literature, in which investigating or controlling its supposed knowledge or power is seen as advantageous. In the New Age community, techniques such as autosuggestion and affirmations are believed to harness the power of the subconscious to influence a person&#x27;s life and real-world outcomes, even curing sickness. &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head. In addition, critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias.

Psychologists and psychiatrists use the term &quot;unconscious&quot; in traditional practices, where metaphysical and New Age literature often use the term &quot;subconscious&quot;. It should not, however, be inferred that the concept of the unconscious and the New Age concept of the subconscious are precisely equivalent, even though they both warrant consideration of mental processes of the brain. Psychologists and psychiatrists take a much more limited view of the capabilities of the unconscious than are represented by New Age depiction of the subconscious. There are a number of methods in use in the contemporary New Age and paranormal communities that affect the latter: affirmations, autosuggestion, binaural beats, hypnosis, and subliminal messages.

<doc id="1125002" wikidata="Q3544048" url="?curid=1125002" title="USS Blackfin">
<text>USS &quot;Blackfin&quot; (SS-322), a submarine in commission from 1944 to 1948 and from 1951 to 1972, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the blackfin cisco, a food fish of the Great Lakes.

During World War II, &quot;Blackfin&quot; completed five war patrols in the Philippine Islands, South China Sea, and Yellow Sea. She sank the Japanese destroyer , which until then was known for her legendary luck, surviving for most of the war and a number of important Japanese naval operations. &quot;Blackfin&quot; also sank a Japanese cargo ship. After World War II, &quot;Blackfin&quot; served in the United States Pacific Fleet, and saw service in the Vietnam War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Blackfin&quot;′s keel was laid on 10 June 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 12 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Phyllis Irwin Lockwood, wife of Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, and commissioned on 4 July 1944 with Lieutenant Commander George H. Laird, Jr., in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====July–September 1944====
After shakedown training in the waters off New London, Connecticut, &quot;Blackfin&quot; got underway to join the war in the Pacific on 14 August 1944. She transited the Panama Canal on 29 August and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 11 September 1944. She spent the rest of September 1944 undergoing repairs and engaged in training in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands. 

====First war patrol====

On 30 September 1944, &quot;Blackfin&quot; set out from Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol. She topped off her fuel tanks at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 10 October 1944 and then continued on her way to her patrol area in the northern approaches to the Palawan Passage in the Philippine Islands.

&quot;Blackfin&quot; operated in Philippine waters as the Philippines campaign of 1944–1945 began with the U.S. invasion of Leyte on 20 October 1944, which led to the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23–26 October 1944. She made her first contact with Japanese ships on 26 October and began an approach, but one of the Japanese ships began racing toward her and forced her to dive to evade an attack.

On the morning of 1 November 1944, &quot;Blackfin&quot;′s lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon. Shortly thereafter, a Japanese merchant ship — the 2,745-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;No. 12 Unkai Maru&quot; — with four escorts appeared on the horizon. &quot;Blackfin&quot; fired six torpedoes at &quot;No. 12 Unkai Maru&quot; and sent her to the bottom. On 3 November, &quot;Blackfin&quot; sighted a lighted Japanese ship but soon positively identified her as a hospital ship, and therefore immune from attack. On 7 November 1944, &quot;Blackfin&quot; sighted a large Japanese tanker with three escorts and attacked, observing two torpedoes hit the tanker, which was only damaged.

&quot;Blackfin&quot; continued her patrol uneventfully until she received orders on 18 November 1944 to conduct a special mission. Accordingly, on 24 November she rendezvoused off Mindoro′s northern coast with a United States Army commando team which had captured a small Japanese patrol boat carrying many current Japanese ciphers and codebooks. She picked up three bags of the classified material and proceeded south toward Morotai. Off Point Anna, she transferred the bags to the Royal Australian Navy corvette .

After parting company with &quot;Kiama&quot;, &quot;Blackfin&quot; headed for Australia. She paused briefly at Darwin in Australia′s Northern Territory before concluding her patrol with her arrival at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 4 December 1944. She moored alongside the submarine tender there for a refit. Upon its completion, she carried out training activities.

====Second war patrol====

On 2 January 1945, &quot;Blackfin&quot; got underway for her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the South China Sea. Upon reaching her station off the eastern coast of the Malay Peninsula, she joined a coordinated attack group of U.S. submarines covering the area. In the early morning of 24 January  1945, she contacted a Japanese convoy consisting of a large tanker and four escorts, some of them destroyers. She soon gained position for an attack on the tanker, but shortly after she fired torpedoes from her bow torpedo tubes at it, one of the Japanese destroyers came dangerously close to &quot;Blackfin&quot;. &quot;Blackfin&quot; then attacked the destroyer, and one of her torpedoes hit it just abaft the bridge. The target, later identified as , was enveloped in a large cloud of white smoke and sank at . Until her encounter with &quot;Blackfin&quot;, &quot;Shigure&quot; had been known for her legendary luck, surviving a number of important Japanese naval operations since the beginning of the war in the Pacific in December 1941.

After torpedoing &quot;Shigure&quot;, &quot;Blackfin&quot; swung around to bring her stern torpedo tubes to bear on the tanker and scored one hit before another escort opened fire on &quot;Blackfin&quot;. &quot;Blackfin&quot; broke off her attack and cleared the area. She then reestablished contact with the convoy and later that night, while she prepared to renew her attack, she sighted a Japanese ship and an escort she had not seen before through her high periscope. She began closing in on this second group of Japanese ships to make an attack, but a Japanese plane arrived on the scene and forced her to dive.

On the afternoon of 25 January 1945, &quot;Blackfin&quot; made contact with the submarine . Since both Japanese convoys &quot;Blackfin&quot; had sighted were in shallow waters nearing Singapore, the commanding officers of the two submarines agreed to abandon the chase. Later that night, &quot;Blackfin&quot; came across a Japanese antisubmarine warfare group searching for American submarines. The Japanese ships began chasing &quot;Blackfin&quot;, but she escaped unharmed.

A few days later, &quot;Blackfin&quot; received orders to take station off Saigon in Japanese-occupied French Indochina for lifeguard duty in support of Allied airstrikes. No activity was seen in the area, so &quot;Blackfin&quot; moved to patrol the southern approaches to the Palawan Passage and Balabac Strait. She then moved farther west to join a submarine scouting line in an attempt to contact a large Japanese naval force heading north from Singapore to Japan. On the afternoon of 12 February 1945, she spotted a Japanese force consisting of two battleships, a heavy cruiser, and at least three destroyers. She headed north into heavy seas in order to get into position for an attack. As she closed the Japanese task force, one of the Japanese destroyers broke away from the formation and headed toward her, forcing her to open the range while trying to maintain contact. Faster than &quot;Blackfin&quot;, the Japanese ships gradually opened the range and disappeared.

&quot;Blackfin&quot; then received orders to proceed to Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, where she concluded her patrol on 15 February 1945. She was one of the first three American submarines to arrive at the newly established base, and U.S. Army forces were still fighting the Japanese for control of the town of Olongapo, the main seaport on Subic Bay, when she arrived. The base lacked its full complement of personnel, and the resulting manpower shortage meant that &quot;Blackfin&quot;′s crew carried out its own refit with some help from the crew of the submarine tender .

====Third war patrol====

On 6 March 1945, &quot;Blackfin&quot; set out from Subic Bay on her third war patrol. She was assigned a patrol area in the South China Sea off the coast of French Indochina near Camranh Bay as part of a large coordinated attack group of U.S. submarines.

Late in March 1945, the coordinated attack group received a report of a heavily escorted Japanese convoy moving up the coast of French Indochina. On the morning of 28 March, &quot;Blackfin&quot; spotted the masts of several ships north of Camranh Bay. Since the convoy was hugging the coastline to make submarine attacks more difficult, she had to enter shallow water to press home her attack. Just as she closed to within torpedo range of the largest ship of the convoy, one of the escorts began dropping depth charges. The first depth-charge attack nearly sank &quot;Blackfin&quot; and put most of her equipment out of commission. She stayed on the bottom in of water for several hours in the hope of shaking the Japanese escorts. The Japanese ships finally gave up the hunt, and &quot;Blackfin&quot; cleared the area and headed for the open sea to begin repairing her damage.

After &quot;Blackfin&quot;′s crew had more fully surveyed her damage, orders arrived for her to proceed to Fremantle for repairs. On 9 April 1945, she arrived at Fremantle and began repairs and a refit, completing her patrol.

====Fourth war patrol====

On 7 May 1945, &quot;Blackfin&quot; departed Fremantle to begin her fourth war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the vicinity of Singapore. After only two days on station, engineering failures forced her to proceed to Subic Bay for repairs. She moored alongside the submarine tender there, but &quot;Anthedon&quot;′s crew found the necessary repairs to be beyond their capacity. As a result, orders came sending &quot;Blackfin&quot; to Pearl Harbor. She made a fuel stop at Saipan on the way and reached Pearl Harbor in mid-June 1945.

====June–August 1945====
After three weeks of repairs at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Blackfin&quot; got underway on 17 July 1945 for the western Pacific.

On 11 August 1945, &quot;Blackfin&quot; got underway from Saipan to embark upon her fifth war patrol. She was in the eastern approaches to the Ryukyu Islands en route to her patrol area in the Yellow Sea when World War II ended with the cessation of hostiities with Japan on 15 August 1945. She nonetheless continued on to the Yellow Sea, where she began sinking floating naval mines. She sank 61 mines before receiving orders on 29 August 1945 set a course for Guam in the Mariana Islands. After weathering a typhoon, she concluded her patrol with her arrival at Guam on 5 September 1945.

===1945–1948===
After undergoing repairs and fueling at Guam, &quot;Blackfin&quot; proceeded to San Diego, California, where she joined Submarine Squadron 1 and began local operations off the coast of California. On 2 January 1946, she got underway for Guam with other units of the squadron. She remained at Guam until 20 February 1946, when she headed back to the United States West Coast.

After an overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on Mare Island in Vallejo, California, &quot;Blackfin&quot; stood out of San Francisco Bay on 28 June 1946 to participate in Operation Iceberg. She paused at Pearl Harbor to top off fuel and supplies, and then left in company with the submarine bound for the Arctic Ocean. At Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island in the Aleutian Islands, the submarines and joined the mission, and the group proceeded north through the Bering Sea and the Bering Strait to the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice pack. &quot;Blackfin&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle before leaving the Arctic Ocean on 30 July 1946 and heading for Guam. She reached Apra Harbor on Guam on 12 August 1946.

<text>The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6. c. 97) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which created the National Parks Commission which later became the Countryside Commission and then the Countryside Agency, which became Natural England when it merged with English Nature in 2006. The Act provided the framework for the creation of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England and Wales, and also addressed public rights of way and access to open land.

==Background==
The Act was passed in 1949 with all-party support, as part of the reconstruction of the UK by the Labour government after World War II.

The Act followed reports by:
*a government committee chaired by Christopher Addison (later Viscount Addison) in 1931, 
*John Dower, secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks, to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945, and
*a government committee chaired by Sir Arthur Hobhouse in 1947, which proposed 12 national parks.

==National parks==

The first 10 British national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural upland. An eleventh &#x27;national park&#x27; in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads was set up by a special Act of Parliament, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act, in 1988. Strictly speaking, this is not a national park, but the differences are sufficiently small that this entity is always regarded as being &quot;equivalent to&quot; a national park. The New Forest was designated a national park on 1 March 2005. The South Downs, the last of the 12 areas chosen in the 1947 Hobhouse Report, was designated as South Downs National Park by the Secretary of State Hilary Benn in March 2009, making 15 national parks in total.

==Amendments==
The structure set up by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 was amended by:
*the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which created the Nature Conservancy Council (which later became Natural England and transferred functions of the Countryside Commission in Wales to the Countryside Council for Wales)
*the Environment Act 1995, under which each national park is now operated by its own National Park Authority
*the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, under which AONBs are now designated
Further amendments are made by the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, under which English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service merged on 1 October 2006 to form new bodies called Natural England and the Commission for Rural Communities.

<text>The Blind River is a river in Algoma District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. The river is in the Great Lakes Basin and is a tributary of Lake Huron.

The river was called a &quot;blind river&quot; because the river&#x27;s mouth is not easily seen from the lake. Its native (Ojibway) name is &quot;biniwaabikong&quot;, which means &quot;at the fallen rock&quot; due to the smooth, sloping rock face along the river.

The river flows south from Pathfinder Lake through a group of other large lakes (such as Matinenda, Chiblow, and Duborne) before emptying into the North Channel of Lake Huron at the municipality of Blind River.

A sawmill was built near the mouth of this river in 1837. There is a small hydroelectric plant where the river drains Lake Duborne.

==Blind River Provincial Park==
The Blind River Provincial Park is a waterway park protecting the river, its banks, and the lakes along its way from its headwaters at Stone Lake to Matinenda Lake. Additionally, it includes the streams and lakes that make up the Flack Lake Figure Eight and the Dunlop Lake–Mace Lake Canoe Routes. It was established in 2004 and is meant for canoe camping, boating, fishing, hunting and wildlife/nature watching. Features in the park include wetlands, large islands, a scenic canyon and waterfalls at the inlet to Matinenda Lake.

The park is regionally significant due to its cold water aquatic environments and its headwater protection function. It borders the Matinenda Provincial Park to the South.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no services. The only facilities are backcountry campsites.

<text>HM Prison Kilmarnock is a prison in Bowhouse, Hurlford near Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland. It is situated south-east of Hurlford on the Mauchline Road. Its location means it is locally known as &quot;Bowhouse Prison&quot;.

The prison was opened 25 March 1999 by Premier Prison Services and was privately run by Serco (who acquired Premier in 2002) until the expiry of their contract in March 2024 at which point the Scottish Prison Service took over direct management of the prison.

In 2005 the BBC program Panorama uncovered several failings in the operational running of the prison, resulting in the prison carrying out internal investigations.

The prison has a design capacity of 500 places and holds short-term, long-term and remand male adults.

<doc id="1125013" wikidata="Q3646700" url="?curid=1125013" title="Building the Perfect Beast">
<text>Building the Perfect Beast is the second solo studio album by American rock singer Don Henley, released on November 19, 1984, by Geffen Records. A commercial and critical success, it is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Henley&#x27;s solo work.

For the album, Henley collaborated primarily with guitarist Danny Kortchmar, along with members of the then line-up of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who contributed to the writing of the songs: guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboardist Benmont Tench and drummer Stan Lynch, the last of whom would later collaborate with Henley in composing the Eagles&#x27; song &quot;Learn to Be Still&quot;, which was released on their live album &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; (1994). The album also features contributions from Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham, the Go-Go&#x27;s lead vocalist Belinda Carlisle, and features contributions from Randy Newman, Jim Keltner, Waddy Wachtel, Pino Palladino, Steve Porcaro, and Ian Wallace.

The album reached #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned four singles which all reached the top forty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, which would become one of Henley&#x27;s most popular songs and win him numerous awards, including a Grammy Award and four MTV Video Music Awards.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kurt Loder wrote that &quot;&quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot; is a meticulously crafted and programmed set of songs about love and politics. The first side is given to personal reflections on love and loss, such as the wistful &quot;Boys of Summer.&quot; Side two is more issue-oriented, tackling subjects from genetic engineering (&quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;) to America&#x27;s reckless foreign policy (&quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot;). The album&#x27;s longest and most ambitious piece, &quot;Sunset Grill,&quot; describes in disturbingly vivid images a character&#x27;s sense of entrapment in an evil, convulsive metropolis: &quot;You see a lot more meanness in the city/It&#x27;s the kind that eats you up inside/Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity.&quot; The magazine placed the album at No. 73 on its 1989 list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;.

Reviewing retrospectively for AllMusic, critic Vik Iyengar has written of the album, &quot;After experimenting with synthesizers and a pop sound on his solo debut, Don Henley hits the mark on his sophomore release, &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;. This album established Henley as an artist in his own right after many successful years with the Eagles, as it spawned numerous hits.&quot;

<text>Ōtamahua / Quail Island ( or ) is an uninhabited island within Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō in the South Island of New Zealand, close to Christchurch. The island was given its European name by Captain William Mein Smith who saw native quail here in 1842; though they were already extinct by 1875. means &#x27;the place where children collect sea eggs&#x27;. refers to the pepper trees found on the island.

==History==
===Pre-European history===
Ōtamahua was still often visited to collect shellfish, flax, bird&#x27;s eggs as well as stone for tools (from Aua / King Billy Island, an outcrop just off Ōtamahua). Its significance to Te Hapū o Ngāti Wheke as a site for food gathering was acknowledged with the installation in 2019 of a 9 metre tall pou whenua. This pillar was carved by Caine Tauwhare and named Te Hamo o Tū Te Rakiwhānoa: a hamo was a tool for planting kūmara.

===Quarantine and leper colony===
Europeans briefly farmed the island in 1851, before it was turned into a quarantine station in 1875, a hospital during the influenza epidemic of 1907, and a small leper colony from 1906 to 1925.

During its time as a leper colony, fourteen men were sent there, and two died there. Ivon Skelton arrived in 1919. Born in Apia, Samoa, he was visiting family on the West Coast in 1918 when he was diagnosed with leprosy. He and his cousin were put into isolation in Cobden, but while his cousin was released, Skelton was sent to Quail Island. He died there on 22 October 1923 at age 24, and was buried on the island. A small fence was put up around the grave in 1931. An attempt was made in 2015 to exhume the body, to save it from threatening erosion and to study the DNA of the disease as little was known about Pacific strains. However, two days of excavations found only a ceramic pot and glass bowl, perhaps used to hold flowers, and a large hole that had been filled with rocks, perhaps to protect the site from erosion.

Sam Te Iringa was brought to the island in late 1920 from Kirikau Pā, where only his niece had been willing to care for him. He found a run-down colony without a nurse. Due to the poor conditions he tried to organise a strike, but as the patients did no work, the strike was not effective. He died in January 1922 on a Friday afternoon, and was buried the next day by Lyttelton priest Father Patrick Cooney. The location of his grave is unknown.

Another patient George Phillips walked off the island at low tide in 1925, crossing the mud flats to Charteris Bay where he posed as a clergyman. From there he took a taxi to Christchurch, changed his surname to Freeman, and spent his last years in a boardinghouse in Petone. He died there in 1931.

Other leprosy patients included Jim Lord, Jim Kokiri, Pakira Matawai, Ah Pat, Ipirini Apa Apa, and Ah Yip. Will Vallance, from Queensland, had been diagnosed at age 30 and spent 19 years on the island. He was among the last eight patients who were moved off the island in 1925 to Makogai. In 1931 the patients&#x27; huts were pulled down, other buildings removed, and furniture sold.

Animals were also quarantined on the island, separately from the leprosy patients. These were huskies, mules and ponies going to Antarctica on Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s expeditions. Subantarctic explorations that used Quail Island were the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition (1901–04), &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition (1907–09), &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition (1910–13), and the &quot;Byrd Antarctic&quot; Expedition (1928–30).

Replicas of dog kennels (once used for training of the dogs used in Antarctic expeditions of the early 20th century) and a replica leprosy patient&#x27;s hut were built by students of Cathedral College, with the quarantine barracks also restored and moved to the beach front.

==Ecological restoration==
The island was declared a recreation reserve in 1975, prior to that it was working farm (sheep and potatoes) until the late 1970s by David Halliwell who also acted as the island&#x27;s last live on caretaker.

The Ōtamahua/Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust and the Department of Conservation are currently working to remove pests and re-vegetate the island, with the aim of eventually re-introducing native wildlife. The Trust aims to restore of native forest to the island to provide a refuge for locally extinct, uncommon and threatened bird and invertebrate species of the Banks Peninsula region.

Community volunteers have been transformed large areas of the island from dry and desolate pest-ridden areas to a safe haven for indigenous species. The project is unique in the way it balances the recreational use and historical features of Ōtamahua / Quail Island while re-establishing the native ecosystems, both flora and fauna. Penguin nesting boxes have also been established on the island to provide a safe nesting site for the white-flippered penguin, an endangered Banks Peninsula native. The Trust organises fortnightly work parties on the island to undertake animal and weed pest control. An annual planting is undertaken each spring.

Since 1997, volunteers have eradicated rabbits, cats, hedgehogs, and ship rats from the island. A trap network on the mainland and the stepping-stone island to Ōtamahua aim to prevent reinvasion, but the island&#x27;s inter-tidal link to the mainland make this likely, particularly by rodents.

The Trust&#x27;s volunteers have planted more than 95,000 native trees and shrubs, established a nursery to propagate silver tussock, and eradicated all predators except mice. As a result, birds, invertebrates and rare plants have been reintroduced to the island. This includes korimako and kererū as well as &quot;Lepidium aegrum&quot; (Banks Peninsula scurvy grass), a &quot;nationally critical&quot; plant. Invertebrates translocated include a Banks Peninisula ground beetle &quot;Megadromus guerinii&quot;, Banks Peninsula tree weta &quot;Hemideina ricta&quot;, and the leaf-vein slug &quot;Pseudaneitea maculata&quot;.

== Visitors ==
About 16,000 people visit the island every year. Ōtamahua / Quail Island is the only substantial island in the Canterbury area accessible to the public. This island has a number of safe swimming beaches, as well as same-day facilities (toilets, day shelter). A ferry service is available to the island, and private watercraft may also access the island. The Ōtamahua/Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust encourages and facilitates educational activities and relevant research on the natural features and cultural history of the island. Many schools and groups now visit the island to combine outdoor activities with their studies of the natural environment. It is possible for to stay the night on the island. The Caretakers House can be booked via the department of Conservation website. There are two bunkrooms with 12 beds available.

<doc id="1125018" wikidata="Q2276908" url="?curid=1125018" title="Wollaston, Northamptonshire">
<text>Wollaston is a village and civil parish in North Northamptonshire, England, about south of the market town of Wellingborough. The 2011 census recorded the population of the parish, including Strixton, as 3,491.

Wollaston is from above sea level on hills east of the Nene valley. The soil is clay over subsoil and is on the old Wellingborough to London road. Summer Leys Local Nature reserve is nearby.

The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as &quot;Wilavestone&quot;. In a document written in 1190 it is spelt &quot;Wullaueston&quot;. The name comes from Old English and is believed to mean the farmstead or village of a man named Wulfaf.

==History==
Wollaston was developed as a linear settlement starting at what is now Cobbs Lane moving past Bell End, Rotten Row, St Michaels&#x27; Lane and down towards Strixton.

===Romano-British===
Settlement and activity in the area are known to date from at least Roman times. Remains of an Romano-British vineyard are known in Wollaston, and are some of the first such sites confirmed in Britain. The course of a Roman road passes roughly east–west just south of the modern part of Wollaston. The course of another Roman road passes north–south to the east.

===Anglo-Saxon===
There is strong evidence of an Anglo-Saxon settlement and activity, including the discovery of the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer helmet in a warrior&#x27;s grave dating from about AD 700.

===High Middle Ages===
The oldest visible part of Wollaston is known as Beacon Hill, an ancient castle earthwork or burial mound which once belonged to Bury Manor. The mound was once surrounded by a great ditch which dates back to the 12th century. A wall plaque records that this was the site of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle.

In 1260 William de Bray secured a charter from Henry III to hold an annual Michaelmas fair and a weekly market to be held on a Tuesday.

In 1282 Margery de Wolaston was elected Abbess of Delapré Abbey in Northampton. She died circa 1296.

===18th century===
In 1788 Wollaston&#x27;s open fields and common lands were inclosed by Act of Parliament. At the time David Hennell, a lace dealer from Wollaston wrote &quot;I lament that this field is now agoing to be enclosed. Some that have large quantities of land are set upon it, and pay no regard to the many little ones that may be injured, and I fear many ruined.&quot; The enclosure reduced the number of landowners in the village from 108 to just 18.

===19th century===

Wollaston&#x27;s first school opened in 1842 and was located in a building next to what is now the Indian restaurant (formerly The Cuckoo pub), opposite Bell End. The school was private and was run by a curate, the Reverend JJ Scott, from his own funds. The school did not come under government control until 1873. The school has moved several times, finally being established on College Street in a building dating from May 1894.

In this period significant industry came to Wollaston in the form of shoe-making. In 1885 one of the shoe factories was established as a workers&#x27; co-operative of local cobblers, which survived until the 21st century as Northamptonshire Productive Society and remains a shoe factory as NPS (Shoes) Ltd, making shoes under the George Cox, Tredair, Solovair and NPS brands among others. The Wollaston Vulcanising Co-Operative was another local business.

===20th century===
Shoe-making, and the mechanisation of this work, continued in the early 20th century with a number of nationally known shoe-making companies establishing themselves in Wollaston and surrounding area.

In 1940 Scott Bader moved manufacturing to Wollaston from London; the move became permanent and the company is now an integral part of the local community. The company founders, Ernest Bader and Dora Scott, established the Scott Bader Commonwealth in the 1950s, gifting the whole company to its employees for all time. The company now functions as a co-operative with profits divided between investment in the company, bonus for employees and charitable donations. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s LSM Engineering, a manufacturer of model steam engines, was based in Wollaston.

===21st Century===
In common with the rest of Northamptonshire, Wollaston is noted for its shoe industry. The Solovair brand of British-made boots and footwear is produced by NPS Shoes Ltd. NPS has been in operation in the village since 1881 and now has a factory shop. Until 2003, Dr. Martens boots were made in Wollaston. In 2007, manufacture of the &quot;Made in England&quot; line of Dr. Martens footwear was resumed in the Cobbs Lane Factory in Wollaston.

Wollaston also has the head office of an international chemical company, founded by the Quaker Ernest Bader (1890–1982), which is now a common ownership factory, the Scott Bader Commonwealth, making advanced resins and composite materials.

==Notable Buildings==

Wollaston has both a primary and a secondary school (Wollaston School), local shops, post office, library and public houses. The village has four churches: Church of England, Baptist, Methodist and a Salvation Army Citadel.

Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the benefice of St Mary&#x27;s parish church was held by Delapré Abbey in Northampton. The oldest parts of the building are 13th-century. It is a Grade II* listed building.

At the north end of the High Street there is a village museum.

== Transportation ==
The village is connected by the W8 Wellingborough–Bozeat bus route. It is bypassed to the west by the A509. Some people also travel by &quot;Banana Kupa&quot; Cars. They are an underrated and not very well-known taxi service.

==Notable people==

* Ernest Bader and Dora Scott founded Scott Bader and gifted the company to its employees.
* Henry Keep was born in Wollaston and emigrated to Australia in the 1890s, later becoming a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly
* Cyril Perkins (1911 – 21 November 2013), was the oldest living first-class cricketer. He played for Northamptonshire and Suffolk.

<doc id="1125023" wikidata="Q413454" url="?curid=1125023" title="Sebacic acid">
<text>Sebacic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid with the chemical formula . It is a white flake or powdered solid. &quot;Sebaceus&quot; is Latin for tallow candle, &quot;sebum&quot; is Latin for tallow, and refers to its use in the manufacture of candles. Sebacic acid is a derivative of castor oil.

In the industrial setting, sebacic acid and its homologues such as azelaic acid can be used as a monomer for nylon 610, plasticizers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, cosmetics, candles, etc.

It can be used as a surfactant in the lubricating oil industry to increase the antirust properties of lubricating oils on metals.

==Production and reactions==
Sebacic acid is produced from castor oil by cleavage of ricinoleic acid, which is obtained from castor oil. Octanol and glycerin are byproducts. 

It can also be obtained from decalin via the a hydroperoxide, which rearranges to give a hydroxycyclodecanone, which dehydrates to give cyclodecenone, a precursor to sebacic acid.

Sebacic acid has also been produced commercially by Kolbe electrolysis of adipic acid.

==Potential medical significance==
Sebum is a secretion by skin sebaceous glands. It is a waxy set of lipids composed of triglycerides (≈41%), wax esters (≈26%), squalene (≈12%), and free fatty acids (≈16%). Included in the free fatty acid secretions in sebum are polyunsaturated fatty acids and sebacic acid. Sebacic acid is also found in other lipids that coat the skin surface. Human neutrophils can convert sebacic acid to its 5-oxo analog, i.e., , a structural analog of 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid and like this oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid is an exceptionally potent activator of eosinophils, monocytes, and other pro-inflammatory cells from humans and other species. This action is mediated by the OXER1 receptor on these cells. It is suggested that sebacic acid is converted to its 5-oxo analog during, and thereby stimulates pro-inflammatory cells to contribute to the worsening of, various inflammatory skin conditions.

<doc id="1125036" wikidata="Q7834921" url="?curid=1125036" title="Transport for Greater Manchester">
<text>Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) is a local government body responsible for co-ordinating transport services throughout Greater Manchester in North West England. It is an executive arm of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA), the city region&#x27;s administrative authority. The strategies and policies of Transport for Greater Manchester are set by the GMCA and its Greater Manchester Transport Committee (GMTC). The committee is made up of 33 councillors appointed from the ten Greater Manchester boroughs (Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan), as well as the Mayor of Greater Manchester.

TfGM owns Metrolink – the United Kingdom’s largest light rail network – which is operated and maintained under contract by a Keolis/Amey consortium. TfGM also owns Greater Manchester&#x27;s Cycle Hire scheme, and is responsible for cycling and walking infrastructure. TfGM owns and maintains bus stations, stops &amp; shelters, however bus services are deregulated in Great Britain outside London. Following the passing of the Bus Services Act 2017, Greater Manchester became the first city-region to start the process of bus franchising, returning bus services to public control. TfGM does not control National Rail services or infrastructure in Greater Manchester.

TfGM is responsible for developing the Bee Network, an integrated transport network for Greater Manchester. The Bee Network is proposed to include a single transport livery, integrated fares &amp; ticketing, and a fare cap across tram, bus, cycling, walking, and eventually suburban rail. By 2025, Metrolink trams, franchised buses services, and cycle hire are planned to be integrated. Negotiations with central government are ongoing for some commuter rail services to join the network, starting from 2025.

==History==
The organisation traces its origins to the Transport Act 1968, when the SELNEC (South East Lancashire/North East Cheshire) Passenger Transport Executive was established to co-ordinate public transport in and around Manchester. Between 1974 and 2011, it was known as the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), until a reform of local government in Greater Manchester granted it more powers and prompted a corporate rebranding. On 1 April 2011, the GMPTE became Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a new regional transport body for Greater Manchester that forms part of the new Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA).

==Governance==

TfGM inherited the responsibilities of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive established in 1974. At the same time the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority (GMITA) was abolished, with responsibility for oversight of the executive transferred to the combined authority.

The combined authority and the ten Greater Manchester districts have delegated or referred most of their transport governance functions to a joint committee, the Bee Network Committee. Each local authority appoints one of its executive members with responsibility for transport matters to sit alongside the mayor, a member of the GMCA, and up to four other councillors appointed by the mayor. These additional mayoral appointees allow the committee&#x27;s political make-up to reflect the political make-up of Greater Manchester&#x27;s councils as a whole.

The Bee Network Committee has four key responsibilities: Decision-making over significant operational matters across the transport network (including the ability to draw down funding for investment), monitoring the performance and financial stability of the network, developing policy to support the local transport plan, and facilitating coordination between the ten local authorities around highways maintenance and infrastructure delivery.

==Services==
===Manchester Metrolink===

The Manchester Metrolink light rail/tram system launched in 1992, entirely subsidised by TfGM without a government grant and operated by KeolisAmey. It carried 43.7 million passengers in the 2018/19 financial year. With 99 tram stops, it is the second largest local transport network in the United Kingdom after the London Underground. Further expansion of the network to places like Stockport and Bolton are envisaged.

==Bee Network==

The Bee Network is a proposed integrated transport network for Greater Manchester, composed of bus, tram, cycling, and walking routes. TfGM&#x27;s vision is for the network to be operational by 2024, with commuter rail services joining the network by 2030.

Originally devised in 2018 as a network of active travel routes, the vision for the Bee Network was expanded following the Greater Manchester Combined Authority&#x27;s decision to use the powers given to it under the Bus Services Act 2017 to introduce a bus franchising scheme for the city region. A fleet of buses were branded and repainted yellow for this in 2024. The active travel subset of the Bee Network was then renamed the &quot;Bee Active Network&quot;.

Greater Manchester is set to invest a further £40.7m in its walking, wheeling and cycling infrastructure as it progresses with its delivery of the largest active travel network in the country. The £23.7m has been allocated to 13 schemes in total, including a new active travel corridor along Chapel Street in Salford and a striking cycling and walking ‘helix ramp’ as part of the new Stockport Interchange.

==Corporate identity==
TfGM uses a corporate identity designed in-house. The black and white &quot;M&quot; logo is adapted from the GMPTE logo and was used on bus stops across Greater Manchester. It has since been replaced by a yellow “Bus Stop” sign, with the Bee Network logo appearing in the corner of the sign.

<text>Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High Charter School, often referred to as High Tech High (HTH), is a public charter high school in San Diego, California, United States. The school is now one of several schools operated under the High Tech High charter schools umbrella organization.

==History==

Beginning in 1998, forty public and corporate partners, led by current board chair Gary Jacobs, began meeting to discuss the current state of education in San Diego. Faced with a shortage of workers for the locally strong high tech and biotech industries, the group wondered why the local school system was not better able to produce more qualified workers. Having given money to the school district in the past and questioning the return on that investment, these local entrepreneurs decided to open a new high school and christened it High Tech High.

Soon thereafter, longtime educator Larry Rosenstock was asked to present to this group about different possible governance structures for the school. He then became the founding principal of the school, and is now the C.E.O. of the network of schools.

The school was founded in September 2000 with 200 students and currently educates 527 students.

High Tech High occupies a building on the former Navy Training Center in the Point Loma area, which is now known as Liberty Station. The school is organized that on a project-based learning model (most learning comes from multi-subject projects, rather than the more traditional approach, where teachers talk and students listen), real-world connection, personalization, and having a common intellectual mission (no ability grouping). Together with several of the other HTH schools, the school is called the &quot;High Tech High Village&quot;, which most students simply call &quot;The Village&quot;.

==Methodology==
At the High Tech High schools, the method of teaching is based on &quot;project-based learning&quot;, in which students are given a project which involves working independently or in groups and doing research to complete it. Some classes have projects where grades from different subjects will be all part of the same project.

Projects the students have worked on include designing a human-powered submarine, genetic manipulation, designing a water treatment plant, writing a book on the Harlem Renaissance, creating a sitcom and building a robot out of old computer parts.

All students complete internships in the junior year. These internships are currently a three-week immersion experience working full-time at various places such as website companies, biotech firms, non profits, and other schools.

==Financing==
The schools are primarily publicly funded. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed a one-time gift of $1000 per student when the school opened, and has pledged millions of dollars to build more schools following the model over the next four years. Some are already in operation. Financial support to develop the original HTH also came from Gary Jacobs, son of Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs. Jacobs also donated almost 9 million dollars in building space for three of the schools in the village.

==FIRST Robotics==
The school is home to one of thirty FIRST Robotics Competition teams in San Diego County. The school&#x27;s team is named The Holy Cows.

Starting in 2011, High Tech High&#x27;s The Holy Cows and Francis Parker School&#x27;s W.A.R. Lords (We Are Robot Lords) began hosting an off-season FIRST Robotics Competition. Known as The Battle at the Border, the event is intended to allow rookie teams to engage in a simulated competition, prior to the start of the next year&#x27;s official season. Additionally, teams are encouraged to use the event to familiarize new students with the program.

In 2013, The Holy Cows and four other FRC teams lead the 87th Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, including: Team 16; The Bomb Squad, Team 180; S.P.A.M., Team 25; Raider Robotix, and Team 1477; Texas Torque.

==Athletics==
Cross Country/Track &amp; Field Water polo, Women&#x27;s basketball. Men&#x27;s basketball, Women&#x27;s rugby, Men&#x27;s rugby, Women&#x27;s soccer, Men&#x27;s soccer, Women&#x27;s tennis, Men&#x27;s tennis, The High Tech High cross country team, known as the Storm, competes in San Diego CIF sanctioned meets and invitationals. They are 2007-2016 reigning Frontier League champions.. The team qualified for the CIF State Cross Country Meet in 2014 and 2016. 

==Results==

The school has had over 600 visitors, including US state Governors Gray Davis (California), Tom Ridge (Pennsylvania), Bill Owens (Colorado), and Senator Joe Lieberman, in its first year alone. Other visitors include Peter Yarrow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Eli Broad, Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez, and Bill Richardson, and Jesus Rubalcaba. On February 15, 2006, Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey made an appearance on their education tour.

The central High Tech High Learning organization (with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) has since opened several middle schools and high schools using the original HTH model:

*High Tech High International, San Diego
*High Tech High Media Arts, San Diego
*High Tech High North County, San Marcos, California
*High Tech Los Angeles, Los Angeles
*High Tech Middle, San Diego

<text>Hindu Love Gods was an American rock band that was, in essence, an occasional side project of members of R.E.M., with (at various times) Warren Zevon and Bryan Cook.

==History==
The band debuted with three scattered gigs (all in Athens, Georgia) in 1984. The group played mostly cover tunes, though a few unreleased originals also made it into the mix. The first gig took place on February 15, 1984, and featured Bryan Cook (vocals and organ, a member of Athens bands Is/Ought Gap, Club Gaga, Thumb Attack, Oh-OK and Time Toy), and R.E.M. members Bill Berry (drums), Peter Buck (guitar) and Mike Mills (bass). The follow-up gig took place on February 29, two weeks later; added to the line-up was R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe on vocals, and Warren Zevon on vocals, keyboards, and guitar. Zevon had known the R.E.M. members &quot;for years&quot; through a mutual acquintance dating back to Peter Buck&#x27;s university years. Zevon performed his hit &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, as well as several other songs that were, at that point, unrecorded (including &quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot; and &quot;Trouble Waiting to Happen&quot;). The final 1984 gig took place on June, and featured the Cook/Berry/Buck/Mills line-up. 

The group entered the studio as a quintet on February 28 (the day before their second gig), with the line-up of Berry/Buck/Cook/Mills/Zevon. They recorded two songs for release as a single, which were eventually released in 1986. The A-Side, &quot;Gonna Have a Good Time Tonight&quot;, was a cover of an Easybeats tune; the B-side, &quot;Narrator,&quot; was a Bill Berry composition that R.E.M. had played live, but never recorded. (The song&#x27;s composition was credited to Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe.) Cook was the lead vocalist on both tracks.

After a period of inactivity, Hindu Love Gods played one 1986 gig in Athens as a benefit for the family of the recently deceased musician D. Boon of San Pedro band Minutemen who had once toured with R.E.M. The personnel for this performance was Berry, Buck, Cook, Mills and Stipe.

Buck, Mills and Berry later joined Zevon as his back-up band while recording Zevon&#x27;s solo album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; (1987). During an all-night (and supposedly drunken) session in the midst of recording Zevon&#x27;s album, the four recorded ten cover songs, mostly blues standards. Although originally not intended for publication, these recordings were finally released by Giant Records on the album &quot;Hindu Love Gods&quot; (1990), with the artist credit going to Hindu Love Gods. The song that received the most attention was a rock version of Prince&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, which reached No. 23 on the Modern Rock charts.

During a concert at The Shadow in Kansas City in December 1990, Zevon commented that the album was &quot;selling by the shitload,&quot; whereupon one of his backing band informed him that it was &quot;selling like shit.&quot; The album peaked at No. 168 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Album Charts.
