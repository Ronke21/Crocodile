<text>The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (in case citations, W.D.N.C.) is a federal district court which covers the western third of North Carolina.

Appeals from the Western District of North Carolina are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

== Jurisdiction ==
The court&#x27;s jurisdiction comprises the following counties: Alexander, Alleghany, Anson, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey. It has jurisdiction over the cities of Asheville, Charlotte, Hickory, and Statesville.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Western District of North Carolina represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. the United States attorney is Dena J. King.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of North Carolina was established on June 4, 1790, by . On June 9, 1794, it was subdivided into three districts by , but on March 3, 1797, the three districts were abolished and the single District restored by , until April 29, 1802, when the state was again subdivided into three different districts by .

In both instances, these districts, unlike those with geographic designations that existed in other states, were titled by the names of the cities in which the courts sat. After the first division, they were styled the District of Edenton, the District of New Bern, and the District of Wilmington; after the second division, they were styled the District of Albemarle, the District of Cape Fear, and the District of Pamptico. However, in both instances, only one judge was authorized to serve all three districts, causing them to effectively operate as a single district. The latter combination was occasionally referred to by the cumbersome title of the United States District Court for the Albemarle, Cape Fear &amp; Pamptico Districts of North Carolina.

On June 4, 1872, North Carolina was re-divided into two Districts, Eastern and Western, by . The presiding judge of the District of North Carolina, George Washington Brooks, was then reassigned to preside over only the Eastern District, allowing President Ulysses S. Grant to appoint Robert P. Dick to be the first judge of the Western District of North Carolina. The Middle District was created from portions of the Eastern and Western Districts on March 2, 1927, by .

<text>The viola sonata is a sonata for viola, sometimes with other instruments, usually piano. The earliest viola sonatas are difficult to date for a number of reasons:
*in the Baroque era, there were many works written for the viola da gamba, including sonatas (the most famous being Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Three Sonatas for Viola da Gamba and Harpsichord, now most often played on the cello)
*in the Classical era and early Romantic, there were few works written with viola specifically in mind as solo instrument, and many of these, like those of the Stamitz family, may have been written for the viola d&#x27;amore, like most of their viola works—though it is now customary to play them on the viola; it was more typical to publish a work or set, like George Onslow&#x27;s opus 16 cello sonatas, or Johannes Brahms&#x27;s Clarinet Sonatas in the late 19th century, that specified the viola as an alternate. Two early exceptions were the viola sonata of Felix Mendelssohn (1824, posthumously published in 1966) and the opus 1 sonata of the composer Ernst Naumann (1832–1910), published in 1854.
* The viola returned to a solo role in the 20th century. Max Reger wrote three sonatas for either clarinet or viola at the beginning of the century. Paul Hindemith, himself a viola virtuoso, composed works several sonatas for viola solo, and others for viola and piano such as the Sonata for Viola and Piano, Op. 11 No. 4 in 1919. Rebecca Clarke composed the Sonata for viola and piano the same year. Bax&#x27;s Viola Sonata, written (like Walton&#x27;s concerto) for the great English viola player Lionel Tertis in 1923, is one of his most-played and oft-recorded chamber works. Mieczysław Weinberg wrote four viola sonatas between 1971 and 1983. The Sonata for Viola and Piano, Op. 147, is the last composition by Dmitri Shostakovich, completed in July 1975 and dedicated to Fyodor Druzhinin. György Ligeti wrote his Sonata for Solo Viola between 1991 and 1994.
* In the 21st century, Graham Waterhouse wrote a viola sonata entitled &quot;Sonata ebraica&quot; , completed in 2013.

<doc id="1137983" wikidata="Q1390373" url="?curid=1137983" title="Tony Rice">
<text>David Anthony Rice (June 8, 1951 – December 25, 2020) was an American bluegrass guitarist and singer. He was an influential acoustic guitar player in bluegrass, progressive bluegrass, newgrass and acoustic jazz. He was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2013.

Rice&#x27;s music spans the range of acoustic music from traditional bluegrass to jazz influenced, New Acoustic music to songwriter-oriented folk. Over the course of his career, he played alongside J. D. Crowe and the New South, David Grisman (during the formation of Dawg Music) and Jerry Garcia, led his own band, the Tony Rice Unit, collaborated with Norman Blake, recorded with his brothers Wyatt, Ron, and Larry, and co-founded the Bluegrass Album Band. Over the course of his career, he recorded with drums, piano and soprano sax as well as with traditional bluegrass instruments.

==Early years==
Rice was born in Danville, Virginia, Growing up, Tony had somewhat of a nomadic childhood. In search of work, his family moved around a lot living in several states including Florida, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. They settled in Los Angeles, California, where his father, Herb Rice, introduced him to bluegrass music. Herb was a mandolin player and taught each of his four sons how to play. Tony and Wyatt were taught guitar, Larry the mandolin, and Ronnie the upright bass. Tony and his brothers learned the fundamentals of bluegrass and country music from L.A. musicians like the Kentucky Colonels, led by Roland and Clarence White. When the Rice family moved to California, Herb joined the Golden State Boys, which was a group inspired by the Kentucky Colonels. In 1960, when Tony was nine years old, he met Clarence White, his all-time favorite guitarist, at a show. Tony was so enamored that White allowed him to try out his 1935 D-28 Martin. This guitar was famous for having an enlarged sound hole. Rice never forgot this moment. So much so, that in 1975, Rice purchased this guitar. This guitar “became iconic in his hands” and became famously known by its serial number, 58957. Clarence White&#x27;s guitar playing in particular was a huge influence on Rice adding elements beyond those of Doc Watson&#x27;s adventurous, fiddle influenced style. Crossing paths with fellow enthusiasts like Ry Cooder, Herb Pedersen and Chris Hillman reinforced the strength of the music he had learned from his father.

In 1971, Tony met Kate Freeman, whom he married in Lexington church a year later. The couple moved to California when Tony joins David Grisman in creating Grisman’s &quot;Dawg,&quot; a newly imagined form of acoustic music. Tony and Kate ended things in 1979.

==Groups==

Mandolinist and fiddler, Sam Bush tells the story about first hearing Rice in 1970 at a campfire at Carlton Haney&#x27;s bluegrass festival in Reidsville, North Carolina. Bush, who at the time was playing guitar in the Bluegrass Alliance after Dan Crary left, brought Tony to the group.

That year, Rice moved to Louisville, Kentucky, playing with the Bluegrass Alliance and shortly thereafter with J.D. Crowe&#x27;s New South. The New South was known as one of the best and most progressive bluegrass groups eventually adding drums and electric instruments to Rice&#x27;s displeasure. When Ricky Skaggs joined them in 1974, however, the band recorded &quot;J. D. Crowe &amp; the New South&quot;, an acoustic album that became Rounder Records&#x27; top seller up to that time. At that point, the group was Rice on guitar and lead vocals, J.D. on banjo and vocals, Jerry Douglas on Dobro, Skaggs on fiddle, mandolin, and tenor vocals, and Bobby Slone on bass and fiddle.

Around this time, Rice met mandolinist David Grisman while recording for Bill Keith&#x27;s first album with Rounder Records called &quot;Something Auld, Something Newgrass, Something Borrowed, Something Bluegrass&quot;. Grisman played with Red Allen and the Kentuckians during the 1960s after Frank Wakefield left and who was now working on original material that blended jazz, bluegrass, and classical music. Rice left the New South and moved to California to join Grisman&#x27;s all-instrumental group, the David Grisman Quintet. In order to broaden his expertise and make himself more marketable, Rice studied chord theory, learned to read charts, and began to expand his playing beyond bluegrass. Guitarist John Carlini came in to teach Rice music theory, and Carlini helped him learn the intricacies of jazz playing and musical improvisation in general. The David Grisman Quintet&#x27;s 1977 debut recording is considered a landmark of acoustic string band music.

In 1980, Rice, Crowe, fiddler Bobby Hicks, mandolinist Doyle Lawson and bassist Todd Phillips formed the Bluegrass Album Band and recorded several successful albums for Rounder Records from 1980 to 1996.

Following that with the Tony Rice Unit, he pursued experimental &quot;spacegrass&quot; music on the &quot;Mar West&quot;, &quot;Still Inside&quot;, and &quot;Backwaters&quot; albums. Members of the Unit included Jimmy Gaudreau (mandolin), Wyatt Rice (guitar), Ronnie Simpkins (bass), John Reischman (mandolin), and Rickie Simpkins (fiddle). In the late 1980s, Alison Krauss regularly played with the group in concert for about a year though she never recorded with them. Alison Brown also guested with the group during that time.

==Collaborations==

In 1980, he recorded a successful album of traditional bluegrass duets with Ricky Skaggs called &quot;Skaggs &amp; Rice&quot;. He followed that with two albums alongside traditional instrumentalist and songwriter Norman Blake both well received and two Rice Brothers albums (1992 and 1994) that featured him teamed with his late elder brother, Larry, and younger brothers, Wyatt and Ronnie.

Beginning in 1984, Rice collaborated on four albums with bluegrass banjo phenom Béla Fleck – &quot;Double Time&quot; (1984), &quot;Drive&quot; (1988), &quot;Tales from the Acoustic Planet&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Bluegrass Sessions: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 2&quot; (1999).

Rice joined David Grisman and Jerry Garcia in 1993 to record &quot;The Pizza Tapes&quot;. In 1994, Rice and Grisman recorded &quot;Tone Poems&quot;, an original collection of material where they used historical, vintage mandolins and guitars, different ones for each track.

In 1994, Rice joined Mark Johnson to record &quot;Clawgrass, Mark Johnson with the Rice Brothers and Friends&quot; which featured Tony and his late brother Larry Rice along with his other brothers, Wyatt and Ronnie.

In 1995, Rice recorded a duo album with John Carlini who also played with the David Grisman Quintet.

In 1997, Rice, his brother Larry, Chris Hillman (formerly of the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Byrds) and banjoist Herb Pedersen founded the so-called anti-supergroup Rice, Rice, Hillman &amp; Pedersen and produced three albums between 1997 and 2001.

In the 2000s and 2010s, he performed in a quartet with guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Rowan, bassist Bryn Bright (later known as Bryn Davies), and mandolinist Billy Bright (replaced by Sharon Gilchrist).

==Solo career==
In 1979, Rice left Grisman&#x27;s group to record &quot;Acoustics&quot;, a jazz inspired album followed by &quot;Manzanita&quot;, a bluegrass and folk album. On albums that followed, &quot;Cold on the Shoulder&quot;, &quot;Native American&quot;, and &quot;Me &amp; My Guitar&quot;, he combined bluegrass, jazzy guitar work and the songwriting of Ian Tyson, Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Bob Dylan, Gordon Lightfoot and Mary Chapin Carpenter.

Rice&#x27;s singing voice was a rich, distinctive baritone. In 1994, he was diagnosed with a disorder known as muscle tension dysphonia and as a result was forced to stop singing in live performance. A 2014 diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis (&quot;tennis elbow&quot;) made guitar playing painful and his last performance playing guitar live was when he was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2015, he said &quot;I am not going to go back out into the public eye until I can be the musician that I was, where I left off or better. I have been blessed with a very devout audience all these years and I am certainly not going to let anybody down. I am not going to risk going out there and performing in front of people again until I can entertain them in a way that takes away from them the rigors and the dust, the bumps in the road of everyday life.&quot;

The authorized biography of Tony Rice, called &quot;Still Inside: The Tony Rice Story&quot;, written by Tim Stafford and Hawaii-based journalist Caroline Wright, was published by Word of Mouth Press in Kingsport, Tennessee, United States in 2010. The book&#x27;s official release was at Merlefest in North Carolina that year.

==Death==
Rice died at his home in Reidsville, North Carolina, on December 25, 2020, at age 69. He died while making his coffee according to a statement from longtime friend and collaborator, Ricky Skaggs.

== Influence ==
Tony Rice &quot;redefined bluegrass guitar playing and left a lasting imprint on the genre.&quot; David Grisman called Rice &quot;a complete musician of the highest caliber&quot; and Ricky Skaggs said he was &quot;the single most influential acoustic guitar player in the last 50 years.&quot;

Although Rice’s guitar playing was colorful and recognizable, flash was not his aim. His rhythm playing was driving and clear, while his solos were strategic and melodic. Rice stepped outside of what any other guitarist was doing at the time. Doing this, he raised the bar of what a bluegrass guitar player could do. Tony Rice was one of the most influential bluegrass guitar players of all-time.

In a lesson exploring Rice&#x27;s style, guitarist Molly Tuttle said &quot;the beauty of Tony&#x27;s playing is that there&#x27;s something for everyone to learn from. I&#x27;ve been playing guitar for a long time and I still go back to this and just want to listen to him strum the guitar.&quot; Rice was a big influence on the bluegrass band Punch Brothers who devoted their album &quot;Hell on Church Street&quot; as a tribute to Rice and to his 1983 album &quot;Church Street Blues&quot;. Members of the Punch Brothers band said that Rice&#x27;s earlier albums had a huge impact on their music. In addition, guitarist Chris Eldridge was a student of Rice&#x27;s. The group had intended that their album be a surprise gift to Rice but he died before they could finish it.

<doc id="1137984" wikidata="Q11380086" url="?curid=1137984" title="Kenickie">
<text>Kenickie were an English four-piece pop punk band from Sunderland. The band was formed in 1994 and consisted of lead vocalist, guitarist, and lyricist Lauren Laverne (b. Lauren Gofton), drummer Johnny X (real name Pete Gofton, Lauren&#x27;s brother), lead guitarist and occasional lead vocalist Marie du Santiago (b. Anne Marie Nixon) and bass guitarist Emmy-Kate Montrose (b. Emma Jackson). The band&#x27;s name comes from their favourite character in the film &quot;Grease&quot;.

==History==

By the time &quot;Catsuit City&quot; (1995) was released on Slampt, Kenickie declined an offer by Alan McGee to sign to Creation. The band opened the bill for the Ramones&#x27; final UK appearance at the Brixton Academy on 3 February 1996. Following the release of &quot;Skillex&quot; (1996) on Fierce Panda, Kenickie signed to Saint Etienne&#x27;s EMI subsidiary, EMIDisc. Kenickie registered in the UK Singles Chart, their highest position being No. 24 with the single &quot;In Your Car&quot;, which opened &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on the 10 January 1997 edition. Their debut album, &quot;At The Club&quot;, peaked at No. 9 in the UK Albums Chart in May 1997. Kenickie also contributed a song to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot;, released in June that year. That summer, they were scheduled to play Glastonbury; their set was postponed, due to rain, but took place later on the scheduled day.

After meeting them in New York, Courtney Love said:
They&#x27;re a big bunch of sex, that band Kenickie. They&#x27;re a big, raw-boned bunch of fucking sex — all three of them and the boy. I hope they get good. I hope we&#x27;re a good example to them, I hope this record&#x27;s huge and then the big labels will start sniffing around and then those big fucking raw-boned sexy Newcastle (sic) girls will be huge and have Number Ones and there will be an Amazon planet the way I want it.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Get In&quot;, appeared in 1998. It was well received in the music press (NME generally praised the album while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; rated it 8/10), but sold less well. Johnny X, who now referred to himself as Pete X, moved to guitar, with the live band augmented by Graham Christie (later of Data Panik) on drums and Dot Allen on keyboards.

Kenickie disbanded on 15 October 1998 after a London Astoria gig, where Lauren closed the night by saying &quot;We were Kenickie ... a bunch of fuckwits&quot;.

==After Kenickie==
Lauren Laverne released one solo EP in 2000, &quot;Take These Flowers Away&quot;, and earlier that year sang on the Mint Royale single &quot;Don&#x27;t Falter&quot;, which reached No. 15 in the UK chart. Laverne also was an uncredited vocalist on The Divine Comedy&#x27;s 2004 single &quot;Come Home Billy Bird&quot;, which reached No. 25 in the same chart. Since then she has presented various radio shows on radio station Xfm, most notably the breakfast show, before quitting in April 2007. She moved into television, originally as a guest on early episodes of music quiz &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. She earned her own weekly spot on Channel 4 music show &quot;Planet Pop&quot; and became presenter, with Myleene Klass, of ITV music programme in 2005, and hosted Channel 4&#x27;s music show &quot;Transmission&quot; with Steve Jones in 2006 and 2007. She currently presents the mid-morning show on BBC 6 Music, and in 2018, she became the host of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. 

Du Santiago and Montrose started short-lived clubnight Shimmy in Gerrard Street, London before they went on to form a new band called Rosita, and released two singles before splitting up in September 2001. Du Santiago retired from music at this point before returning in 2007as Marie Nixonas a member of The Cornshed Sisters. They have released two album so far, &quot;Tell Tales&quot; (2012) and &quot;Honey and Tar&quot; (2017). Nixon&#x27;s four songwriting credits on the latter were the first new songs released by any of the three female Kenickie members since Laverne&#x27;s EP seventeen years earlier. She is also former head of communications for the Northern region of the Arts Council. In Autumn 2012, she took up position as Chief Executive of the University of Sunderland Students&#x27; Union. 

Montroseas Emma Jacksonformed synth trio The Pictures after Rosita split and later edited journal &quot;The High Horse&quot; during 2005–2010 while occasionally playing with jam band Snakes And Ladders. She completed a PhD in sociology in 2010 at Goldsmiths University. After some time as a research fellow in Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow, she returned to Goldsmiths in January 2015 as a lecturer in the Department of Sociology.

Johnny X went on to record under the name J Xaverre. He toured with Peter Brewis of Field Music&#x27;s new project The Week That Was and later played in Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings.

The band&#x27;s onetime touring keyboard player Tony O&#x27;Neill (known in the band as Elvis Wesley) is now an author, living in the United States.

Laverne is the last remaining member of the band to still use her Kenickie stage name; Nixon and Jackson last referred to themselves as Du Santiago and Montrose in early 2002 for a DJ appearance together at London clubnight Stay Beautiful. Pete Gofton had already ceased calling himself &quot;Johnny X&quot; during the band&#x27;s lifetime due to an American rapper at the time using the name.

==Legacy==
Kenickie have been credited as having inspired a wave of mainstream female guitar bands that emerged in the wake of their split, including 21st Century Girls, Hepburn and Thunderbugs. They were also cited as an influence on a generation of female alternative bands, such as Chicks, Angelica, Cheetara (who covered Come Out 2Nite) and Vyvyan, some of whom were associated with the Club Rampage/Club P*rnstar &quot;Bratpop&quot; scene.

<text>Richard Sandoval (October 18, 1960 – July 21, 2024) was an American professional boxer and Lineal and WBA Bantamweight Champion. Sandoval was a silver medalist at the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico and was a U.S. Olympian during his amateur career. He was also the younger brother of title contender Alberto Sandoval.

==Early life==
Sandoval who was of Mexican descent was born in Pomona, California, a city famous in pugilistic circles as a hotbed for young boxing prospects, including Shane Mosley.

Sandoval&#x27;s brother Alberto Sandoval was a popular bantamweight of the 1970s, who unsuccessfully challenged Carlos Zarate and Lupe Pintor for the world title.

The young Sandoval met another future world champion, Alberto Davila, at Pomona boxing gyms. Eventually, they became friends, and they shared the burden of boxing&#x27;s dangers later on in life.

==Amateur career==
Sandoval was a two-time National Golden Gloves Champion and from 1979 to 1980, Sandoval went on to win the National AAU Championship at Light Flyweight and then in the Flyweight division. Sandoval qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. In 2007, he received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

==Professional career==
Richie Sandoval made his professional boxing debut on 5 November 1980, beating Gerardo Pedroza in Las Vegas, Nevada by a knockout in two rounds. He won his first ten fights by knockout, including two over fringe contender Javier Barajas. For his eleventh fight, Sandoval met Harold Petty, a boxer who was still fighting professionally at the age of 42 and who challenged twice for world titles. On 28 January 1982, he outpointed the undefeated Petty over ten rounds, going on to seven more wins that year, including another ten-round points victory over Petty.

Sandoval had five wins in 1983, the year in which his friend Davila won the WBC Bantamweight title by knocking out Kiko Bejines, who died days later. This introduced Sandoval to the darker side of boxing as he saw how hard it was for Davila to recover.

===WBA Bantamweight Championship===
Sandoval&#x27;s next fight was held on 7 April 1984. Despite his record of 22 victories without any losses, including fifteen knockouts, he was a virtual unknown to most boxing fans when he met the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion Jeff Chandler in Atlantic City. After dropping the champion in round eleven, Sandoval won by TKO in round fifteen to become a world champion in a major upset. He followed this up with his first trip abroad as a professional boxer, to Monte Carlo on September 22. He outpointed the top ranked and well known Edgar Román over fifteen rounds on the undercard of Donald Curry&#x27;s sixth-round knockout win over Nino LaRocca. He fought again on 15 December against Cardenio Ulloa, who was attempting to become the first Chilean world boxing champion in history. According to the report made by &quot;Ring En Español&quot;, Ulloa caused Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to jump off his chair with excitement when he dropped Sandoval in the third round, but Sandoval recovered and retained the title with an eighth-round knockout.

By then, however, Sandoval was facing weight problems and he could barely make the weight even for fights in the Featherweight division, two divisions above Bantamweight, and he was forced to fight all his fights in 1985 as a Featherweight instead. He scored three ten-round decisions that year and one in 1986, including wins over Frankie Duarte and Diego Avila.

====Last bout and title defence====
After not defending his title for a year and a half, he was forced by the WBA to defend his title or be stripped of it. He chose to defend it, despite his problems making the weight. On 3 March 1986, Sandoval defended his title against Gaby Canizales, as part of a super-undercard organized by promoter Bob Arum, which included the Hearns versus Shuler and Hagler versus Mugabi encounters. Sandoval reportedly had to lose around twelve pounds in three days in order to be able to fight that night, staying off any solid foods and surviving only on water. Weakened and feeling the side-effects of such a sudden drop-off in weight, Sandoval suffered four knockdowns, but he fought on until the fifth knockdown, which happened in round seven, after which the referee stopped the fight. He fell unconscious a few minutes after the fight, stopping breathing for an estimated three minutes. He was rushed to hospital by local on-site paramedics, but he remained in critical condition for the next few nights. He had life-saving brain surgery, but the inevitable consequence was that Sandoval was obliged to retire. His final record was 29 wins and one loss, 17 wins by knockout.

==Professional boxing record==


==Retirement and death==
Sandoval later went touring across the United States with Davila, as each had been through both sides of a tragic boxing bout. They went on television talk-shows and public appearances to explain to the general public how a boxer feels (in Davila&#x27;s case) after an opponent has died, and how a boxer can be so close to death in an instant after a fight (in Sandoval&#x27;s case), and then having to deal with the fact that he or she will never be able to box again. Sandoval and Davila remained friends.

Sandoval died on July 21, 2024, at the age of 63.

He was part of the main cast of the Netflix original series &quot;Marco Polo&quot;.

==Early life==
Yune was born in Washington, D.C. to mother Park Wonhui and father Yun Taeho, who were both Korean. His younger brother is actor Karl Yune.

Yune was educated at Our Lady of Good Counsel High School (Olney, Maryland) and St. John&#x27;s College High School. In 1994, he received his degree in finance from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School. Yune was one of the original hedge fund traders for SAC Capital but left to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. 

Yune practices many forms of martial arts, but he excels in Taekwondo (in which he holds a black belt) and Boxing (he is a former Golden Gloves boxer). He changed the spelling of his last name from &quot;Yun&quot; to &quot;Yune&quot; for Screen Actors Guild (SAG) purposes.

==Career==
While studying at Wharton, Rick Yune worked as an intern on Wall Street trading stocks during the mid-1992. During that time, he was &quot;discovered&quot; by a modeling agent and soon became the first Asian-American featured in advertisements for Versace and Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo.

Yune made his film debut in 1999, playing Kazuo Miyamoto, a Japanese-American war hero accused of killing a respected fisherman (played by Daniel von Bargen) in the close-knit community, in director Scott Hicks&#x27; film adaptation of David Guterson&#x27;s post-World War II novel, &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.

In 2002, Yune portrayed Zao, a North Korean terrorist who works for the Korean People&#x27;s Army, opposite Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry, in the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. That year Yune was voted one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot;.

Yune appeared in the 2004 video &quot;Call U Sexy&quot; by the band VS, as well as in &quot;Someone&quot; (1997) by SWV, featuring Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs.

Yune appeared in two 2005 episodes of ABC&#x27;s spy series &quot;Alias&quot;, playing a modern-day samurai Kazu Tamazaki who is hunted down by Jennifer Garner as Sydney. He also appeared as a guest in an episode of ABC&#x27;s legal dramedy series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; and the CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;.

He produced, and starred as a Thai assassin in, the action/adventure movie &quot;The Fifth Commandment&quot;, directed by Jesse V. Johnson and also stars Keith David and Bokeem Woodbine.

Yune starred with Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu in the 2012 martial arts film, &quot;The Man with the Iron Fists&quot;.

In 2013, Yune played Kang Yeon-Sak, a North Korean ultra-nationalist and ex-terrorist mastermind who plans a terrorist attack on the White House, in the action thriller &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;, opposite Gerard Butler.

In 2014, Yune took on the role of Kaidu, a Mongol Khan, in the historical drama series &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. Yune reprised his role in the second season, which was released in 2016.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9.

==Position description==
Outfielders must cover large distances, so speed, instincts and quickness to react to the ball are key. They must be able to catch fly balls above their head and on the run, as well as prevent balls hit down the right field foul line from getting past them. Being situated 250–300 feet from home plate, they must be able to throw the ball accurately over a long distance to be effective. Of all outfield positions, the right fielder often has the strongest arm, because they are the farthest from third base.

As well as the requirements above, the right fielder backs up first base on all throws from the catcher and pitcher, when possible, and all bunted balls, since the catcher or the first baseman must be available for fielding the ball. The right fielder backs up second base on any ball thrown from the left side of the field, i.e. shortstop, third base, or foul line territory. The right fielder backs up first base when the first baseman is in a run down between 3rd base and home.

Right field has developed a reputation in Little League for being a position where weaker players can be &quot;hidden&quot; from the action. Unlike the Major League level where players routinely hit the ball in all directions and distances, most Little League players do not hit the ball into the outfield on a regular basis. Additionally, since right-handed batters—who tend to hit the ball in the left direction—are far more common than left-handed batters, the left fielder (and to lesser degree the center fielder) tend to have much more opportunities to make a play than the right fielder. 

==Popular culture==
The reputation of right field being a position for unathletic players was further brought into the mainstream by children’s entertainer, picture book author and recording artist Willy Welch&#x27;s song &quot;Playing Right Field&quot;, which was popularized by Peter, Paul and Mary as simply &quot;Right Field&quot; for their 1986 album &quot;No Easy Walk to Freedom&quot;, and as a Pizza Hut commercial in 1990. Both the song and commercial feature an awkward Little Leaguer bored out in right field, when the batter hits a ball and the right fielder (to everyone&#x27;s surprise) successfully catches it, breaking the stigma that right fielders are weaker players.

In the children&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, Lucy Van Pelt is the right fielder on Charlie Brown&#x27;s team, and she often misses catches or gets distracted from the game.

<doc id="1137993" wikidata="Q924365" url="?curid=1137993" title="Roger the Engineer">
<text>Roger the Engineer (originally released in the UK as Yardbirds and in the US, West Germany, France and Italy as Over Under Sideways Down) is the only UK studio album and the third US album by the English rock band the Yardbirds. Recorded and released in 1966, it contains all original material and is the only Yardbirds album with guitarist Jeff Beck on all tracks. It was produced by bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and manager Simon Napier-Bell.

Although the British edition is still officially titled &quot;Yardbirds&quot; by authoritative chart sources, such as Official Charts Company, it has since been referred to, first colloquially, then semi-officially, as &quot;Roger the Engineer&quot;, a title stemming from the cover drawing of the record&#x27;s audio engineer Roger Cameron by band member Chris Dreja.

It is the only Yardbirds album to appear in the UK Albums Chart, where it reached number 20. In the US, it reached number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting studio album in the US. It reached number 8 in Finland. The album&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot;, was released as a single in May 1966, two months before the album.

The album is included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2012, the album was ranked number 350 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Recording==
The single &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot;, along with the B-side &quot;Jeff&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, was recorded at Advision Studios in London on 19–20 April 1966. The rest of the album was recorded from 31 May to 4 June 1966, also at Advision. Paul Samwell-Smith and Simon Napier-Bell produced the album, which was released by the Columbia Graphophone Company in the UK on 15 July 1966 and by Epic Records in the US on 18 July 1966.

==Legacy==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective AllMusic review considers the album to be &quot;the Yardbirds&#x27; best individual studio album, offering some of their very best psychedelia&quot;, though not &quot;among the great albums of its era&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 349 in 2003 and at number 350 in 2012 on its list of the &quot;500 greatest albums of all time&quot;.

The American band Nazz (featuring Todd Rundgren) were named after the song &quot;The Nazz Are Blue&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Jeff Beck, Keith Relf, and Paul Samwell-Smith (Dreja and McCarty&#x27;s last names are misspelled as &quot;Drega&quot; and &quot;McCarthy&quot; on the labels of the US album). All songs are recorded in stereo, except where noted.

===US release===


==Personnel==
;The Yardbirds
*Keith Relf – lead vocals (except &quot;The Nazz Are Blue&quot;), harmonica
*Jeff Beck – lead guitar, lead vocals on &quot;The Nazz Are Blue&quot;, bass guitar on &quot;Over, Under, Sideways, Down&quot;
*Chris Dreja – rhythm guitar, backing vocals, piano
*Paul Samwell-Smith – bass guitar (except &quot;Over, Under, Sideways, Down&quot;), backing vocals
*Jim McCarty – drums, backing vocals, percussion
;Cover art
*Chris Dreja – cover design and artwork
*Jim McCarty – sleeve notes

==Release history==
The original American versions of this album (issued with a different album cover and titled &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot; after the hit song of the same name) omitted the songs &quot;The Nazz Are Blue&quot; (which was sung by Jeff Beck) and &quot;Rack My Mind&quot; and is mixed differently than the British editions. Regardless, record collectors have sought out both the mono (LN 24210) and stereo (BN 26210) versions since several tracks are featured with slight differences in the mixes (see US album listing above). Epic&#x27;s 1983 reissue (simply titled &quot;The Yardbirds&quot;) featured the original UK album cover, the two missing tracks, duplication of the British mixing, and two additional tracks: the 1966 single &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot; backed with &quot;Psycho Daisies&quot; which feature Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page on guitar.

In 2021, Demon Records released a &quot;super deluxe&quot; version of &quot;Roger the Engineer&quot; including the mono and stereo versions on LP and CD with extra tracks and outtakes along with a replica of the &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;/&quot;Psycho Daises&quot; single.

<doc id="1137995" wikidata="Q7404641" url="?curid=1137995" title="Salinan">
<text>The Salinan are a Native American tribe whose ancestral territory is in the southern Salinas Valley and the Santa Lucia Range in the Central Coast of California. Today, the Salinan governments are now working toward federal tribal recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
== Geographic origins==

There were two major divisions and one subgroup. From north to south, the &quot;Antoniano&quot; lived in the lower part of the Salinas Valley (which flows south to north), near the future site of two missions: (Mission San Antonio de Padua and Mission San Miguel Arcángel). The &quot;Miguelino&quot; lived on the upper course of the Salinas River, and to the south near Slates Hot Springs, Junipero Serra Peak, and Soledad. There were also a &quot;Playano&quot; subgroup on the Pacific Coast in the vicinity of what is now Lucia and San Simeon. Salinans were Hunter-gatherers and, like most other California tribes, were organized in small groups with little centralized political structure.

They left shell middens behind indicating that they lived in the area in numbers along the coast. Their main diet during the summer consisted of fish and shellfish, evidenced by the fine particles of shell present in the soil for a depth of several feet in areas where the Indians camped. The Salinan named the peak &quot;Pimkolam&quot;.

The Wagon Caves rock formation about northwest of present-day Jolon is an archeological site that was used by the Salinan Antonianos subtribe who researchers believe occupied at least two villages in the area, an older site dating to approximately 450 A.D. and a later, protohistoric site with dates ranging from about 1450 to 1650 A.D. Archeologists have found a stemmed biface, lithic flakes, shell beads, and non-human bones, as well as shell, bone, flaked stone, fire-affected rock, charred seeds, and mortars at the cave site. The rock overhangs and caves have fire-scarred roofs that bear evidence of occupancy over hundreds of years. The Wagon Cave Research Natural Area of contains diverse stands of Valley Oaks of varying ages and densities and has been recommended as a Research Natural Areas within the Los Padres National Forest.

==Etymology==

The tribe&#x27;s name is taken from the Salinas River, as the Spanish did not understand if the people had a name for themselves. The people&#x27;s own name is &quot;Te&#x27;po&#x27;ta&#x27;ahl&quot; or &quot;People of the Oaks,&quot; according to current tribal leadership. C. Hart Merriam called these people the &quot;En-&#x27;ne-sen&quot; on advice from one informant; &quot;En-&#x27;ne-sen&quot; was the native word for the Salinan headquarters.

==Language==

The Salinan language, spoken until the 1950s is a language isolate. It may be a part of the Hokan language family. Sapir included it in a subfamily of Hokan, along with Chumash and Seri; this classification has found its way into more recent encyclopedias and presentations of language families, but serious supporting evidence has never been presented.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Salinan as 3,000. Sherburne F. Cook similarly estimated that there were at least 700 Salinans. The 2000 United States Census reported a total population of Salinan people as 681.

<text>Sarkastodon (&quot;meaty tooth&quot;) is an extinct genus of placental mammals from extinct subfamily Oxyaeninae within extinct family Oxyaenidae, that lived in Asia (in today&#x27;s China and Mongolia) during the middle Eocene. It was a genus of large, carnivorous animals known only from a skull and jawbones. &quot;Sarkastodon&quot; was probably a hypercarnivore that preyed on large mammals in its range during the Middle Eocene, such as brontotheres, chalicotheres, and rhinoceroses. Its weight is estimated at , and its length at 3 m (10 ft).

== Discovery ==
The type specimens of &quot;S. mongoliensis&quot; are known from Eocene deposits from the Irdin Manha Formation of Mongolia. Additional material referred to &quot;Sarkastodon&quot; is known from the Ulan Shireb beds ( from the holotype locality) of Inner Mongolia. These specimens were discovered by Walter W. Granger in 1930, on an expedition to the Gobi Desert.

== Palaeobiology ==

&quot;Sarkastodon&quot; was a hypercarnivore, with hyaena-like dentition specialised in bone-cracking. The sharp, slicing premolars (which form roughly rectilinear cutting blades) and crushing molars enabled &quot;Sarkastodon&quot; to eat both bone and flesh. It was probably an ambush predator, not a fast runner.

<text>Screenwriting or scriptwriting is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is often a freelance profession.

Screenwriters are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film.

Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of development with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
Spec scripts are feature film or television show scripts written without the commission of, but is on speculation of sale to a film studio, production company, or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, however spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool with the vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen. Though a spec script is usually a wholly original work, it can also be an adaptation.

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer&#x27;s knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show&#x27;s producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer&#x27;s career, the Writers Guild of America forbids members to write &quot;on speculation&quot;. The distinction is that a spec script is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script themselves, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director&#x27;s vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with them or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have an excellent title, good writing, and a great logline, laying out what the movie is about. A well-written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up a spec script.

=== Commission ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a green light. The plot development is usually based on highly successful novels, plays, TV shows, and even video games, and the rights to which have been legally acquired.

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a studio, production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from &quot;open&quot; assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company, but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script. Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script&#x27;s central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a &quot;page one rewrite&quot;. When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a &quot;polish&quot; or &quot;punch-up&quot;.

Depending on the size of the new writer&#x27;s contributions, screen credit may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed. These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film&#x27;s creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as script doctors. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, Steve Zaillian, William Goldman, Robert Towne, Mort Nathan, Quentin Tarantino, Carrie Fisher, and Peter Russell. Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghostwriters.

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers—often given other titles, such as story editor or producer—work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show&#x27;s tone, style, characters, and plots. Serialized television series will typically have a basic premise and setting that creates a story engine that can drive individual episodes, subplots, and developments.

Television show creators write the television pilot and bible of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show&#x27;s characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show&#x27;s day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as showrunner, head writer, or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for soap operas and telenovelas is different from that used by prime time shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by Jane Espenson, screenwriting is a &quot;sort of three-tiered system&quot;:
:a few top writers craft the overall story arcs. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format. This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show&#x27;s concept.

===Video game writing===

With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of video game design. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.

== Structural theories ==

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying &quot;Screenplays are structure&quot;.

===Three-act structure===

According to this approach, the three acts are: the setup (of the setting, characters, and mood), the confrontation (with obstacles), and the resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). In a two-hour film, the first and third acts each last about thirty minutes, with the middle act lasting about an hour, but nowadays many films begin at the confrontation point and segue immediately to the setup or begin at the resolution and return to the setup.

In &quot;Writing Drama&quot;, French writer and director Yves Lavandier shows a slightly different approach. As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, and some screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero&#x27;s Journey ===
The hero&#x27;s journey, also referred to as the monomyth, is an idea formulated by noted mythologist Joseph Campbell. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949).

Campbell&#x27;s insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include:
#a call to adventure, which the hero has to accept or decline,
#a road of trials, on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#achieving the goal (or &quot;boon&quot;), which often results in important self-knowledge,
#a return to the ordinary world, which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#application of the boon, in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter Christopher Vogler refined and expanded the hero&#x27;s journey for the screenplay form in his book, &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers&quot; (1993).

=== Syd Field&#x27;s paradigm ===
Syd Field introduced a new theory he called &quot;the paradigm&quot;. He introduced the idea of a &quot;plot point&quot; into screenwriting theory and defined a plot point as &quot;any incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around in another direction&quot;. These are the anchoring pins of the story line, which hold everything in place. There are many plot points in a screenplay, but the main ones that anchor the story line in place and are the foundation of the dramatic structure, he called &quot;plot points I and II&quot;. Plot point I occurs at the end of Act 1; plot point II at the end of Act 2. Plot point I is also called the &quot;key incident&quot; because it is the true beginning of the story and, in part, what the story is about.

In a 120-page screenplay, Act 2 is about sixty pages in length, twice the length of Acts 1 and 3. Field noticed that in successful movies, an important dramatic event usually occurs at the middle of the picture, around page sixty. The action builds up to that event, and everything afterward is the result of that event. He called this event the &quot;centerpiece&quot; or &quot;midpoint&quot;. This suggested to him that the middle act is actually two acts in one. So, the three-act structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in Aristotle’s three acts being divided into four pieces of approximately thirty pages each.

Field defined two plot points near the middle of Acts 2a and 2b, called &quot;pinch I&quot; and &quot;pinch II&quot;, occurring around pages 45 and 75 of the screenplay, respectively, whose functions are to keep the action on track, moving it forward, either toward the midpoint or plot point II. Sometimes there is a relationship between pinch I and pinch II: some kind of story connection.

According to Field, the &quot;inciting incident&quot; occurs near the middle of Act 1, so-called because it sets the story into motion and is the first visual representation of the key incident. The inciting incident is also called the &quot;dramatic hook&quot;, because it leads directly to plot point I.

Field referred to a &quot;tag&quot;, an epilogue after the action in Act 3.

Here is a chronological list of the major plot points that are congruent with Field&#x27;s Paradigm:
===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as &quot;eight-sequence structure&quot;, is a system developed by Frank Daniel, while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at USC. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10–15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as &quot;mini-movies&quot;, each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film&#x27;s first act. The next four create the film&#x27;s second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence&#x27;s resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

== Character theories ==
=== Michael Hauge&#x27;s categories ===
Michael Hauge divides primary characters into four categories. A screenplay may have more than one character in any category.
* hero: This is the main character, whose outer motivation drives the plot forward, who is the primary object of identification for the reader and audience, and who is on screen most of the time.
* nemesis: This is the character who most stands in the way of the hero achieving his or her outer motivation.
* reflection: This is the character who supports the hero&#x27;s outer motivation or at least is in the same basic situation at the beginning of the screenplay.
* romance: This is the character who is the sexual or romantic object of at least part of the hero&#x27;s outer motivation.

Secondary characters are all the other people in the screenplay and should serve as many of the functions above as possible.

Motivation is whatever the character hopes to accomplish by the end of the movie. Motivation exists on outer and inner levels.
* outer motivation is what the character visibly or physically hopes to achieve or accomplish by the end of the film. Outer motivation is revealed through action.
* inner motivation is the answer to the question, &quot;Why does the character want to achieve his or her outer motivation?&quot; This is always related to gaining greater feelings of self-worth. Since inner motivation comes from within, it is usually invisible and revealed through dialogue. Exploration of inner motivation is optional.

Motivation alone is not sufficient to make the screenplay work. There must be something preventing the hero from getting what he or she wants. That something is conflict.
* outer conflict is whatever stands in the way of the character achieving his or her outer motivation. It is the sum of all the obstacles and hurdles that the character must try to overcome in order to reach his or her objective.
* inner conflict is whatever stands in the way of the character achieving his or her inner motivation. This conflict always originates from within the character and prevents him or her from achieving self-worth through inner motivation.

== Format ==
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists&#x27; performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a novel or short story, a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and symbolism.

Most modern screenplays, at least in Hollywood and related screen cultures, are written in a style known as the master-scene format or master-scene script. The format is characterized by six elements, presented in the order in which they are most likely to be used in a script:

# Scene Heading, or Slug
# Action Lines, or Big Print
# Character Name
# Parentheticals
# Dialogue
# Transitions

Scripts written in master-scene format are divided into scenes: &quot;a unit of story that takes place at a specific location and time&quot;. Scene headings (or slugs) indicate the location the following scene is to take place in, whether it is interior or exterior, and the time-of-day it appears to be. Conventionally, they are capitalized, and may be underlined or bolded. In production drafts, scene headings are numbered.

Next are action lines, which describe stage direction and are generally written in the present tense with a focus only on what can be seen or heard by the audience.

Character names are in all caps, centered in the middle of the page, and indicate that a character is speaking the following dialogue. Characters who are speaking off-screen or in voice-over are indicated by the suffix (O.S.) and (V.O) respectively.

Parentheticals provide stage direction for the dialogue that follows. Most often this is to indicate how dialogue should be performed (for example, angry) but can also include small stage directions (for example, picking up vase). Overuse of parentheticals is discouraged.

Dialogue blocks are offset from the page&#x27;s margin by 3.7&quot; and are left-justified. Dialogue spoken by two characters at the same time is written side by side and is conventionally known as dual-dialogue.

The final element is the scene transition and is used to indicate how the current scene should transition into the next. It is generally assumed that the transition will be a cut, and using &quot;CUT TO:&quot; will be redundant. Thus the element should be used sparingly to indicate a different kind of transition such as &quot;DISSOLVE TO:&quot;.

Screenwriting applications such as Final Draft (software), Celtx, Fade In (software), Slugline, Scrivener (software), and Highland, allow writers to easily format their script to adhere to the requirements of the master screen format.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. Pathetic fallacy is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in &quot;City of God&quot;. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife&#x27;s blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife&#x27;s blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising &#x27;The One that got away&#x27;. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Since the advent of sound film, or &quot;talkies&quot;, dialogue has taken a central place in much of mainstream cinema. In the cinematic arts, the audience understands the story only through what they see and hear: action, music, sound effects, and dialogue. For many screenwriters, the only way their audiences can hear the writer&#x27;s words is through the characters&#x27; dialogue. This has led writers such as Diablo Cody, Joss Whedon, and Quentin Tarantino to become well known for their dialogue—not just their stories.

Bollywood and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the screenplay writers.

===Plot===

Plot, according to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, refers to the sequence events connected by cause and effect in a story. A story is a series of events conveyed in chronological order. A plot is the same series of events deliberately arranged to maximize the story&#x27;s dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance. E.M.Forster famously gives the example &quot;The king died and then the queen died&quot; is a story.&quot; But &quot;The king died and then the queen died of grief&quot; is a plot. For Trey Parker and Matt Stone this is best summarized as a series of events connected by either the word &quot;therefore&quot; or the word &quot;however&quot;.

== Education ==
A number of American universities offer specialized Master of Fine Arts and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including USC, DePaul University, American Film Institute, Loyola Marymount University, Chapman University, NYU, UCLA, Boston University and the University of the Arts. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including London College of Communication, Bournemouth University, Edinburgh University, and Goldsmiths College (University of London).

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the TheFilmSchool, The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / Extension Programs in Screenwriting.

New York Film Academy offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

A variety of other educational resources for aspiring screenwriters also exist, including books, seminars, websites and podcasts, such as the &quot;Scriptnotes&quot; podcast.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from George Melies&#x27; 1902 film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The &quot;studio system&quot; of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the &quot;blueprint&quot; (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the &quot;spec script&quot; was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* &quot;Crashing Hollywood&quot; (1931)—A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob does not like how accurate the movie is.
* &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950)—Actor William Holden portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading silent film star, played by Gloria Swanson.
*&quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950)—Humphrey Bogart is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* &quot;Paris, When it Sizzles&quot; (1964)—William Holden plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires Audrey Hepburn to help.
* &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991)—John Turturro plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on William Faulkner).
* &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992)—In this comedy written by Barry Primus and J. F. Lawton, Robert Wuhl is a screenwriter/director who&#x27;s got integrity, vision, and a serious script — but no career. Martin Landau is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to Robert De Niro, Danny Aiello and Eli Wallach - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* &quot;The Player&quot; (1992)—In this satire of the Hollywood system, Tim Robbins plays a movie producer who thinks he&#x27;s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the United States, completed works may be copyrighted, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal registration or notice. However, the Library of Congress will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff&#x27;s copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff&#x27;s claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office. This means that a plaintiff&#x27;s attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process. Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup attorney fees or collect statutory damages for copyright infringement, unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began. For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors.

There is a line of precedent in several states (including California and New York) that allows for &quot;idea submission&quot; claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay—or even a mere pitch for one—to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author&#x27;s copyright. The unfortunate side effect of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read &quot;all&quot; unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad legal releases before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered. In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks. One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, Universal resisted construction of a bike path along the Los Angeles River next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.

<doc id="1137998" wikidata="Q5008648" url="?curid=1137998" title="Cambia (non-profit organization)">
<text>Cambia is an Australian-based global non-profit social enterprise focusing on open science, biology, innovation system reform and intellectual property. Its projects include The Lens, formerly known as Patent Lens, and the Biological Innovation for Open Society Initiative.

Cambia derives its name from the Spanish verb &quot;cambiar&quot;, to change.

==History==
Cambia was established in 1992 by Richard Anthony Jefferson, a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the GUS reporter system, with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, Kate J. Wilson, Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani. Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in &quot;Innovations&quot;, to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.

In 1992, Cambia relocated to Canberra, Australia from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s rice biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in Intellectual Property management. Cambia&#x27;s ethic was influenced by Jefferson&#x27;s early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the Hologenome Theory of Evolution) as models for institution building and collaboration.

Cambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities. By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world. This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur David Green for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.

Over time Cambia&#x27;s focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property. The Patent Lens and its successor The Lens are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia&#x27;s goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise. In 2012 and 2013, Cambia was rated among the top 100 best NGOs globally by The Global Journal.

==Projects==
Cambia&#x27;s work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the Biological Open Source (BiOS) Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) developed in 2005–2007, BiOS sought to establish freedom to operate for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson&#x27;s invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter, a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented Agrobacterium genus.

Another of Cambia&#x27;s projects was the development in 2001 by then Chief Scientist Andrzej Kilian of Diversity Arrays Technology, a solid state sequence agnostic genotyping technology that was spun off into a company, DArT, Pty Ltd to perform agricultural genotyping services to the plant breeding community.

A principal current project of Cambia is the free full-text online patent search and exploration facility and knowledge resource, The Lens (previously the Patent Lens). Launched in 2000 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation as a US agricultural patent search facility, and substantially expanded in 2005–2007 to encompass patent documents from multiple jurisdictions and all domains, and information on the linkages between patent applications and the status of granted patents, the Patent Lens allowed free searching of almost 10 million full-text patent documents. It was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and integrated links to non-patent literature. The Lens was launched in 2013 as the successor to the Patent Lens, making strides in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management; it is the only global patent site with fully open, shareable, annotatable and re-usable data collections. The Lens now hosts more than 111.5 million patent records and over 60.6 million patent families from over 95 different jurisdictions, including European Patent Office (EPO), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), IP Australia, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

The Lens also features an open biological patent facility, PatSeq, led by Professor Osmat Jefferson, with many advanced tools for searching and analysing biological sequences found in patents, to render gene patenting more transparent. The facility has mapped sequences disclosed in gene patents onto the genomes of humans, mice, maize, rice, soybean and others and enable searching at the genome, gene and individual sequence level. The Lens now hosts more than 287 million biological sequences.

In 2017, Professor Osmat Jefferson directed the launching of Lens influence mapping facilities, PatCite and QUT In4M, enabling users to map and measure the influence of scholarly works on invention and innovation. The Lens and its new global In4M Ranking system feature prominently in the &quot;Nature Index 2017 Innovation&quot; supplement, published in leading science journal &quot;Nature&quot; and the seminal paper describing the granular metrics and the rankings options was published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. In December 2017, The Lens became more than a patent and sequence facility with the launch of scholarly works search. Initially exposing the scholarly works cited in the patent literature, The Lens now hosts and serves scholarly works from more than 195.5 million scholarly records from multiple sources including Microsoft Academic, Crossref, ORCID, PubMed, Impactstory and CORE.

==Governance==
Cambia is a social enterprise, and is a registered Non-Governmental Organisation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and a registered observer with the World Intellectual Property Organization. Within Australia, Cambia is registered with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.

Cambia&#x27;s governance is overseen by a Board of Directors, according to its constitution.

==Locations==
As of July 2012, Cambia operates principally from headquarters in Canberra, ACT, with some staff based in Brisbane, Australia, at the Queensland University of Technology. Before its move to Brisbane in 2008, where it operated for four years, Cambia was located on the Black Mountain research campus of the CSIRO while its glasshouse facilities were housed at the Australian National University campus.

<text>Shean Patrick &quot;The Storm&quot; Donovan (born January 22, 1975) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player, with a career including seven National Hockey League (NHL) clubs and 951 games, spanning from 1994 to 2010. He currently serves as a development coach for the Ottawa Senators. 

== Life and career ==
Shean Donovan was born in Timmins, Ontario and grew up in North Bay.

Donovan was drafted 27th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks and played his first full season in 1995–96. After his first four seasons with the Sharks, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche, where he spent three seasons, contributing 13 goals and 19 assists before being traded to the Atlanta Thrashers in 1999.

In 2002, he was claimed by the Pittsburgh Penguins on waivers, then traded to the Calgary Flames in 2004, where he had a breakout during the 2003–04 season, scoring 18 goals. He was a part of the playoff run which saw the Flames defeat the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings, and San Jose Sharks before being defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning by a single goal in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. In April 2011, Donovan recalled the victory as &quot;kind of a bittersweet moment, not winning, but in the end going there was a great memory.&quot;

Donovan played for Genève-Servette HC in the Swiss Nationalliga A during the 2004–05 lockout, returning to the Flames for the 2005–06 season. On July 2, 2006, Donovan was signed to a two-year deal as a free agent by the Boston Bruins, with the intention of bringing more speed and energy to the Bruins. At the conclusion of the 2006–07 season, Donovan was traded by the Bruins to the Ottawa Senators for Peter Schaefer.

Donovan played for the Senators through the 2009–10 season, after which he became an unrestricted free agent. Unable to attract NHL interest before the start of the 2010–11 season, the Anaheim Ducks offered him a professional try-out contract with the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League (AHL). On November 7, yet to make an appearance with the Crunch, Donovan decided to walk away from his try-out to return home, stating that he missed his family, his home in Ottawa, and that he had decided to retire from professional hockey. Donovan is currently a development coach with the Senators.

<text>St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital is a pediatric treatment and research hospital headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962, it is a 501(c)(3) designated nonprofit medical corporation which focuses on children&#x27;s catastrophic diseases, particularly leukemia and other cancers. In the 2021 fiscal year, St. Jude received $2 billion in donations. Daily operating costs average $1.7 million, but patients are not charged for care. St. Jude’s covers some, but not all cancer-related costs. St. Jude treats patients up to age 21, and for some conditions, up to age 25.

==History==
St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962 before a crowd of 9,000 people, with help from Lemuel Diggs and Thomas&#x27; close friend from Miami, automobile dealer Anthony Abraham. The hospital was founded on the premise that &quot;no child should die in the dawn of life&quot;. This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a Maronite Catholic, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. 

Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit, and emptied his wallet – comprising $7 – into the offering box. He prayed for intercession to Saint Jude Thaddeus for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. Thomas promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if the saint interceded for his success, he would build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became a successful comedian and built St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise. Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas&#x27;s confirmation in Thomas&#x27;s boyhood home of Toledo, Ohio.

While some donations for St. Jude come from government grants and insurance recoveries, the principal source of funding comes from the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a semi-independent entity founded in 1957 by Danny Thomas. ALSAC serves primarily to raise funds and promote awareness for St. Jude. They largely collect funds from independent sources, such as companies and individuals.

Danny&#x27;s daughter Marlo Thomas grew up supporting the mission of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, and she became its national outreach director in 1991. 

In 2007, Chili&#x27;s restaurant chain pledged $50 million to fund the construction of the seven-story Chili&#x27;s Care Center, adding , providing space for the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion.

In 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital. In 2017, the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences accepted its inaugural class of PhD students.

In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, the first private spaceflight, raised over $243 million for St. Jude.

==Hospital functions and effects==

St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide.

St. Jude treats patients up to age 21 and for some conditions, up to age 25.

==Corporate structure==
Donald Pinkel was the first director of St. Jude and served from 1962 until 1973. His successor, Alvin Mauer, was director from 1973 to 1983. Joseph Simone was the hospital&#x27;s third director from 1983 to 1992. Arthur W. Nienhuis was CEO and director of St. Jude from 1993 until 2004. William E. Evans, the hospital&#x27;s fifth director, served from 2004 to 2014. He was succeeded by CEO and director James R. Downing on July 15, 2014.

, St. Jude&#x27;s scientific director was James I. Morgan, Ph.D.

Although it was named after Danny Thomas&#x27;s patron saint, St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital. It is a secular institution not affiliated with any religious organization.

==Affiliated institutions==
St. Jude is affiliated with several institutions in the United States, through a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude. As of July 2023, the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include:

* Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
* Novant Health Hemby Children&#x27;s Hospital, in Charlotte, North Carolina
* Huntsville Hospital for Women &amp; Children, in Huntsville, Alabama
* Johnson City Medical Center, in Johnson City, Tennessee
* St. Jude Midwest Affiliate, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Illinois in Peoria, Illinois
* Louisiana State University, Department of Pediatrics, in Shreveport, Louisiana
* Mercy Children&#x27;s Hospital, in Springfield, Missouri
* The Children&#x27;s Hospital at Saint Francis, in Tulsa, Oklahoma

St. Jude also works with Le Bonheur Children&#x27;s Medical Center, also located in downtown Memphis. St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at Le Bonheur Hospital. Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. University of Tennessee physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude.

The Children&#x27;s Cancer Center of Lebanon was established in Beirut on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and works in association with the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).

A commitment has been made to establish a research facility in Memphis, Tennessee, one purpose of which will be to serve as a collaborative hub.

==Funding==
St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) are both nonprofits. From 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of the funds received by St. Jude went to operation or investments. From 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research. In 2012, 81 cents of every dollar donated to St. Jude went directly to its research and treatment. In 2019, ALSAC raised $1.9 billion from donations, of which $975 million (51%) went to St. Jude. The rest of the funds were either spent on functional expenses for ALSAC or added to their fund balance, which totaled $5.7 billion at the end of 2019. In 2020, ALSAC raised $2.4 billion, of which $2 billion were from donations and contributions (84%). $997 million (42%) of this went to St. Jude. At the end of 2020, St Jude&#x27;s fund balance was $8.03 billion. 74% percent of St. Jude&#x27;s total budget comes from donations, and the hospital costs about $1.7 million per day to run.

===Philanthropic aid===
In January 1964, the former presidential yacht USS &quot;Potomac&quot; was purchased by Elvis Presley for US$55,000. Presley then gave the Potomac to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, in Memphis, to sell as a fundraiser.

===Other funding initiatives===

Eagles for St. Jude was a program created in 2007 by Stanford Financial Group, when it paid to become title sponsor of the St. Jude Classic, the annual PGA Tour event in Memphis. The program, and sponsorship, ended in February 2009, when it was found that Stanford Financial Group was a Ponzi scheme, having defrauded investors out of $8 billion, with a small fraction of that stolen money having been channeled into the Eagles for St. Jude program.

===McDonald&#x27;s Monopoly Game===
In 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald&#x27;s Monopoly game piece. McDonald&#x27;s officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, and even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald&#x27;s, McDonald&#x27;s waived the rule and made the annual $50,000 annuity payments.

==Awards and achievements==
In 2022, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital was named the second best children&#x27;s cancer hospital in the U.S by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Peter C. Doherty, Ph.D., of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital was co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work related to how the immune system kills virus-infected cells.

<text>A single-frequency network or SFN is a broadcast network where several transmitters simultaneously send the same signal over the same frequency channel.
Analog AM and FM radio broadcast networks as well as digital broadcast networks can operate in this manner. SFNs are not generally compatible with analog television transmission, since the SFN results in ghosting due to echoes of the same signal.

A simplified form of SFN can be achieved by a low power co-channel repeater, booster or broadcast translator, which is utilized as a gap filler transmitter.

The aim of SFNs is efficient utilization of the radio spectrum, allowing a higher number of radio and TV programs in comparison to traditional multi-frequency network (MFN) transmission. An SFN may also increase the coverage area and decrease the outage probability in comparison to an MFN, since the total received signal strength may increase to positions midway between the transmitters.

SFN schemes are somewhat analogous to what in non-broadcast wireless communication, for example cellular networks and wireless computer networks, is called transmitter macrodiversity, CDMA soft handoff and Dynamic Single Frequency Networks (DSFN).

SFN transmission can be considered as creating a severe form of multipath propagation. The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as self-interference) may result in fading. This is problematic especially in wideband communication and high-data rate digital communications, since the fading in that case is frequency-selective (as opposed to flat fading), and since the time spreading of the echoes may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). Fading and ISI can be avoided by means of diversity schemes and equalization filters.

Transmitters, which are part of a SFN, should not be used for navigation via direction finding as the direction of signal minima or signal maxima can differ from the direction to the transmitter.

== OFDM and COFDM ==
In wideband digital broadcasting, self-interference cancellation is facilitated by the OFDM or COFDM modulation method. OFDM uses a large number of slow low-bandwidth modulators instead of one fast wide-band modulator. Each modulator has its own frequency sub-channel and sub-carrier frequency. Since each modulator is very slow, one can afford to insert a guard interval between the symbols, and thus eliminate the ISI. Although the fading is frequency-selective over the whole frequency channel, it can be considered as flat within the narrowband sub-channel. Thus, advanced equalization filters can be avoided. A forward error correction code (FEC) can counteract some of the sub-carriers being exposed to too much fading to be correctly demodulated.

OFDM is utilized in the terrestrial digital TV broadcasting system DVB-T (used in Europe and other regions), ISDB-T (used in Japan, Brazil, and the Philippines) and in ATSC 3.0. OFDM is also widely used in digital radio systems, including DAB, HD Radio, and T-DMB. Therefore, these systems are well-suited to SFN operation.

== DVB-T SFN ==

In DVB-T a SFN functionality is described as a system in the implementation guide. It allows for re-transmitters, gap-filler transmitters (essentially a low-power synchronous transmitter) and use of SFN between main transmitter towers.

The DVB-T SFN uses the fact that the guard interval of the COFDM signal allows for various length of path echoes to occur is not different from that of multiple transmitters transmitting the same signal onto the same frequency. The critical parameters is that it needs to occur about in the same time and at the same frequency. The versatility of time-transfer systems such as GPS receivers (here assumed to provide PPS and 10 MHz signals) as well as other similar systems allows for phase and frequency coordination among the transmitters. The guard interval allows for a timing budget, of which several microseconds may be allocated to time errors of the time-transfer system used. A GPS receiver worst-case scenario is able to provide +/- 1 μs time, well within the system needs of DVB-T SFN in typical configuration.

In order to achieve the same transmission time on all transmitters, the transmission delay in the network providing the transport to the transmitters needs to be considered. Since the delay from the originating site to the transmitter varies, a system is needed to add delay on the output side such that the signal reaches the transmitters at the same time. This is achieved by the use of special information inserted into the data stream called the Mega-frame Initialization Packet (MIP) which is inserted using a special marker in the MPEG-2 Transport Stream forming a mega-frame. The MIP is time-stamped in the SFN adapter, as measured relative the PPS signal and counted in 100 ns steps (period time of 10 MHz) with the maximum delay (programmed into the SFN adapter) alongside. The SYNC adapter measures the MIP packet against its local variant of PPS using the 10 MHz to measure the actual network delay and then withholding the packets until the maximum delay is achieved. The details is to be found in ETSI TR 101 190 and mega-frame details in ETSI TS 101 191.

It should be understood that the resolution of the mega-frame format is being in steps of 100 ns, whereas the accuracy needs can be in the range of 1-5 μs. The resolution is sufficient for the needed accuracy. There is no strict need for an accuracy limit as this is a network planning aspect, in which the guard-interval is being separated into system time error and path time-error. A 100 ns step represents a 30 m difference, while 1 μs represents a 300 m difference. These distances needs to be compared with the worst-case distance between transmitter towers and reflections. Also, the time accuracy relates to nearby towers in a SFN domain, since a receiver is not expected to see the signal from transmission towers being geographically far apart, so there is no accuracy requirements between these towers.

So called GPS-free solutions exist, which essentially replace GPS as the timing distribution system. Such system may provide benefit in integration with transmission system for the MPEG-2 Transport Stream. It does not change any other aspect of the SFN system as the basic requirements can be met.

==ATSC and 8VSB==

While not designed with on-channel repeaters in mind, the 8VSB modulation method used in North America for digital TV is relatively good at ghost cancellation. Early experiments at WPSU-TV led to an ATSC standard for SFNs, A/110. ATSC SFNs have seen widest use in mountainous areas like Puerto Rico and Southern California, but are also in use or planned in gentler terrain.

Early ATSC tuners were not very good at handling multipath propagation, but later systems have seen significant improvements.

Through the use of virtual channel numbering, a multi-frequency network (MFN) can appear as an SFN to the viewer in ATSC.

==Alternative modulations==

Alternatives to using OFDM modulation in SFN self-interference cancellation would be:
* CDMA rake receivers.
* MIMO channels (i.e. phased array antenna)
* Single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE), i.e. single-carrier modulation combined with guard intervals and FFT-based frequency domain equalization, or its multi-user version Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA).

<doc id="1138009" wikidata="Q1425884" url="?curid=1138009" title="Slovak declension">
<text>Slovak, like most Slavic languages and Latin, is an inflected language, meaning that the endings (and sometimes also the stems) of most words (nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals) change depending on the given combination of the grammatical gender, the grammatical number and the grammatical case of the particular word in the particular sentence:

a) Gender: There are four grammatical genders in Slovak: animate masculine, inanimate masculine, feminine, and neuter. In popular description, the first two genders are often covered under common masculine gender. Almost all Slovak nouns and adjectives, as well as some pronouns and numerals can be categorized into one of these genders. Exceptions are pluralia tantum ( – Christmas, though there are rules for deriving the gender), words that are drifting into another gender and are currently neuter ( – prince), and masculine animals that are animate in singular and mostly inanimate in plural.

b) Number: Like in English, Slovak has singular and plural nouns. Morphological traces of the ancient Indo-European dual number remain, but are not a separate grammar category anymore.
A particular case is associated with three distinct groups of numerals associated with nouns:
* 1 (one) – nominative case singular, for example (one oak)
* 2, 3, 4 – nominative case plural, for example (two oaks)
* 0, 5 and more – genitive case plural, for example (five [of] oaks)

c) Morphological cases:
* the nominative case (N) = the subject; the basic form of the word; answers the question Who / What; for example father (sg), fathers (pl)
* the genitive case (G) =
** (1) in English &quot;of x&quot; or &quot;x&#x27;s&quot;; answers the questions Of whom / Of what; for example father&#x27;s (sg. ), fathers&#x27; (pl);
** (2) is used after the prepositions (without), (near), (to, into), (in(to) the middle of), (out(side) of), (instead of), (around), (from), (according to), (next to, around), (by means of), (along), (at), (in the middle of), (next to, adjacent to), (in, inside of), (above), (out of, from), * (behind)
* the dative case (D) =
**(1) in English &quot;to x&quot;; answers the question To whom / To what; for example to the father (sg), to the fathers (pl);
**(2) is used after the prepositions (to, towards), (because of), (in spite of), (facing, opposing), ((facing, opposing)), (facing, against)
* the accusative case (A) =
**(1) the direct object; answers the question Whom / What; for example [I see the] father (sg), fathers (pl);
**(2) is used after the prepositions: (through), * (between, among), * (on, at), * (above), * (after, for), * (about, on), * (under), (for, because of), * (before, in front of), * (in, on), (regarding, concerning), * (behind, for)
* the locative case (L) = used after the prepositions * (on), * (after), * (about, on), (at, next to), * (in, on)
*the instrumental case (I) =
**(1) in English &quot;by (means of) x&quot;; answers the question By (means of) whom / By (means of) what; for example [written] by the father;
**(2) is used after the prepositions: * (between, among), * (above), * (under), * (before, in front of), (with), * (behind, at the back of)
* The (syntactic) vocative case (V) is not morphologically marked anymore in modern Slovak (unlike in modern Czech). Today the (syntactic) vocative is realised by the (morphological) nominative case, just like in English, German and many other languages. However, the ancient vocative declensions have survived (mostly in conserved, archaic words or language, e.g. in fairy tales, folklore, or in an ironic sense) in some words, some examples: &quot;syn&quot; (son) – V: &quot;synku&quot;, &quot;brat&quot; (brother) – V: &quot;bratu&quot;, &quot;bratku&quot;), &quot;chlapec&quot; (boy, knave) – V: &quot;chlapče&quot;), &quot;švagor&quot; (brother-in-law) – V: &quot;švagre&quot; or N, &quot;kmotor&quot; (godparent) – V: &quot;kmotre&quot; or N), &quot;chlap&quot; (man, male) – V: &quot;chlape&quot;, &quot;priateľ&quot; (friend) V: &quot;priateľu&quot; or N, &quot;pán&quot; (mister, lord) – V: &quot;pane&quot; or N), &quot;majster&quot; (master artist) – V: &quot;majstre&quot; or N), &quot;boh&quot; (god) – V: &quot;bože&quot;, &quot;mama&quot; (mum, mother) – V: &quot;mamo&quot;, &quot;mami&quot;) and was retrofitted (with the help of Czech influence) to some more words, like &quot;šéf&quot; (chief, boss) – V: &quot;šéfe&quot;. There is a dispute among some Slovak linguists whether to include the vocative into the categories grammar, but with declension (mostly) equal to the nominative, or to unify it with the nominative case category. The morphological vocative is used only for the above restricted number of words and in addition only in some contexts (such as many dialects, which still use the vocative case). Note however that there is no dispute that the syntactic vocative exists in Slovak. Slovak schools have been teaching for at least 30 years that there is no grammar category of vocative anymore in use, however, the use of the vocative case in the past is often mentioned. The Slovak Encyclopedia of Linguistics (1993) explicitly says: the vocative is nowadays replaced by the nominative. However, the Slovak National Corpus explicitly includes vocative as a separate case in the morphological analysis and corpus tagset.

There is also a different form of morphological vocative emerging in spoken language, used with some familiar forms of personal names (Paľo - Pali, Jano, Jana - Jani, Zuza - Zuzi) and familiar forms of kinship words, such as &quot;mama – mami&quot; (mum, mother), &quot;oco – oci&quot; (dad, father), &quot;tata, tato – tati&quot; (dad, daddy), &quot;baba, babka – babi&quot; (gran, granny, grandmother). This usage is very similar to the &quot;new Russian vocative&quot; (Маш&#x27;, Петь&#x27;, мам&#x27;), but it is not accepted into standardised codified language. This could have developed out of proper names that were formed using the Hungarian diminutive suffix -i and that are used in spoken Slovak, and therefore is often homonymous with nominative (semi-)diminutive forms of the names. Another possibility is influence from Czech (from common bilingual TV during Czechoslovakia), where Jani / Zuzi as well as mami / tati / babi is part of Common Czech.

== Legend==
* &quot;ends in&quot; in the following refers to the ending in the nominative singular (N sg), unless stated differently;
* Soft consonants are: all consonants with the diacritic mark ˇ (for example š, ľ) + c, dz, j. Hard and neutral consonants are all the remaining consonants;
* For masculine nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals it is necessary to distinguish between animate and inanimate ones. An animate noun is a person (for example father, Peter) and an inanimate noun is any other noun (for example table, fear, democracy). Animals are usually viewed as persons only in sg. For the animate nouns, the G is identical with the A (both in sg. and in pl.), and for the inanimate nouns, the N is identical with the A (both in sg. and in pl.). Animate/Inanimate adjectives, pronouns and numerals are those referring to an animate/inanimate noun respectively (for example in &quot;my father&quot; the &quot;my&quot; is animate, because father is animate);
* sg = singular, pl = plural;
* N, G, D, A, L, I are abbreviations of grammatical cases (see above).

== Nouns ==
For each gender, there are four basic declension paradigms (that is declension models).

Note that many nouns (especially those following the paradigm &quot;chlap&quot;) have different endings than those of the paradigms in one or more grammatical cases. They are neither defined, nor listed in the following. The complete number of different paradigms for nouns is somewhere around 200.

A very small number of foreign nouns are not declined (that is the stem and ending never change).

=== The Masculine Gender===
There is also a 5th paradigm for foreign nouns ending in .-i, -y, -e, -í, -é, -ě, -ä (for example pony, kuli, Tököli, Goethe, Krejčí, abbé, Poupě) and foreign personal names ending in -ü, -ö (for example Jenö), which goes as follows:
*Sg: N: pony, G: ponyho, D: ponymu, A: ponyho, L and I: ponym;
*Pl: like hrdina.

Masculine animal nouns are declined like chlap in the singular, but in plural usually like dub (if they end in a hard or neutral consonant) or like stroj (otherwise).

Notes on chlap:
* For the nouns ending in a vowel (for example -o, -u) the vowel is not part of the stem, but the ending in N sg: for example dedo has G / D sg... deda / dedovi etc. (not *dedoa / *dedoovi etc.)
* many nouns lose an e / o / i from the stem in all cases except N sg (for example vrabec – vrabca);
* in some short nouns, the -e- changes its position in all cases except N sg (for example žnec – ženca);
* some nouns ending in -k / -ch change their final /k/ or /ch/ into /c/ and /s/, respectively in N pl (for example žiak – žiaci);
* words ending in -h use the N pl ending for hrdina instead (such as vrah - vrahovia, súdruh - súdruhovia)
* most Latin and Greek nouns ending in -us, -as, -es lose it in all cases except N sg (for example génius – génia; but for example fiškus – fiškusa).

Notes on hrdina:

 Notes on dub:
* many nouns lose e / o / i / í / i.e. / á from the stem in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example výmysel – výmyslu, chrbát – chrbta, ohníček – ohníčka, dnešok – dneška, ocot – octu )
* some Greek and Latin nouns in -us, -es, -os lose the -us / -es / -os in all cases except N sg and A sg (e.g. komunizmus – komunizmu; but e.g. autobus – autobusu, cirkus – cirkusu);
* some Slovak words lose the acute or the i / u from a diphthong in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example mráz – mraza, chlieb – chleba, vietor – vetra (here along with loss of o), stôl – stola; but bôr – bôru);
* in G pl, some nouns change the a / e / i / o / u (without an acute or a preceding i) in the stem to á / i.e. / í / ô / ú (Krompachy – Krompách, Žabokreky – Žabokriek, Poniky – Poník, sloha – slôh) or in some cases to ia / iu (for example čas – čias, Margecany – Margecian), unless the rhythmical rule prevents it, i.e. the preceding syllable in the stem already contains a vowel with an acute or a diphthong (for example Hájniky – Hájnik);
* in L sg, nouns ending in g / k / h have -u rather than -e.

 Notes on stroj:
* many nouns lose the e / o / i / í / i.e. / á in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;);
* some nouns lose the acute or the i/u from a diphthong in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example &#x27; – &#x27;, &#x27; – &#x27;);
* in G pl, geographical names in pl. (plurale tantum) change the a / e / i / o / u (without an acute or a preceding i) in the stem to á / é / í / ó / ú (for example – ) or in some cases to ia / i.e. / iu / ô (for example – ) in the G pl, unless the rhythmical rule prevents it, i.e. the preceding syllable in the stem already contains an acute or a diphthong.

=== The Feminine Gender ===
There is also a 5th paradigm for feminine nouns ending in -ná or -ovná (for example princezná), where the singular and N pl and A pl are like pekná (see under adjectives) and the remaining plural is like žena. In the G pl, there are changes in the stem: if the noun ends in -vowel + ná, then this vowel receives an acute (for example švagriná &quot;–&quot; švagrín), but otherwise -- is inserted (for example princezná &quot;–&quot; princezien).

There is also a 6th paradigm for the feminine nouns ending in -ea (idea, Kórea), which goes like žena, except that D sg and Lsg are idei, and G pl is ideí without change in the stem.

Notes on žena:
* The following nouns are declined like ulica instead of žena: večera, rozopra, konopa, Hybe and (the plurale tantum) dvere;
* In the G pl of some nouns, an i.e. / e / o / á / ô is inserted in the last syllable of the stem (for example hra – hier, čipka – čipiek/čipôk, karta – kariet/karát, kvapka – kvapiek/kvapák/kvapôk, vojna – vojen, látka – látok);
* In the G pl of some nouns, in the last syllable of the stem the a / i / y / u / ä / e / o / syllabic r / syllabic l (without an acute or a preceding i) is changed into á (or ia) / í / ý / ú / ia / / ô / ŕ / ĺ respectively (sila - síl, skala - skál, chyba – chýb, ruka – rúk, fakulta – fakúlt, päta – piat, slza – sĺz, črta – čŕt, brzda – bŕzd, slza – sĺz).

 Notes on ulica:
* In the G pl of some nouns is inserted (for example jedľa – jedieľ, sukňa – sukieň);
* In the G pl of some nouns, in the last syllable of the stem the a / i / y / u / e / o / syllabic r (without an acute or a preceding i) is changed into á (or ia) / í / ý / ú / / ô / ŕ respectively (for example ulica – ulíc, sudkyňa – sudkýň, Krkonoše – Krkonôš, košeľa – košieľ, guľa – gúľ, hoľa – hôľ, fľaša – fliaš).

Notes on dlaň:
* The following nouns are declined like dlaň, not like kosť: obec, päsť, čeľusť;
* The following feminine nouns are not declined like dlaň, but like kosť: jar, zver, chuť, ortuť, pamäť, smrť, pleť, sneť, rukoväť, smeť, púť, spleť, svojeť, reč, seč, meď, soľ, hluš, myš, voš, lož, bel, Sereď, Sibír, Budapešť, Bukurešť, Lešť and a few other nouns. The words myseľ, chuť, raž, tvár, hneď can be declined like dlaň or like kosť in the singular, but only like dlaň in the plural. The word hrsť is declined like dlaň in the singular, but like kosť in the plural. The word pamäť is declined like kosť when it refers to human memory, but like dlaň when it refers to computer memory;
* most nouns in -eň lose -e- in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example úroveň – úrovne).

Notes on kosť:
* see the first two notes under dlaň;
* some nouns lose -e-/-o- in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example ves – vsi, lož – lži, cirkev – cirkvi).

=== The Neuter Gender ===
For (any) neuter nouns ending in -vowel+um/on (for example štúdium, ganglion) there is actually a 5th paradigm (štúdium), which is declined like mesto except that the -um- / -on- is omitted in all cases except N sg and A sg., L sg ends in -u (štúdiu), and G pl in -í (štúdií).

Notes on mesto:
*Latin and Greek neuter nouns ending in consonant + -um/-on (for example fórum, epiteton) are declined like mesto, except that the -um/-on is omitted in all cases except N sg and A sg (for example, N sg and A sg: publikum, G sg: publika, D sg: publiku etc.);
*in the G pl of some nouns, an ie/ e / o / á / (rarely é) is inserted in the last syllable of the stem (for example clo – ciel, mydlo –mydiel, zvieratko – zvieratiek, jedlo – jedál, vrecko – vrecák/vreciek, vlákno – vláken/vlákien, číslo – čísel / čísiel, lajno – lajen, lýtko – lýtok, teliesko – teliesok;
*in the G pl of some nouns, in the last syllable of the stem, the a / i / y / u / ä / e / o / syllabic r / syllabic l (without an acute or a preceding i) is changed into á / í / ý / ú / ia / / ô / ŕ / ĺ respectively (kladivo – kladív, zrno – zŕn).

Notes on srdce:
* In the G pl of some nouns, an ie/e is inserted in the last syllable of the stem (for example citoslovce – citosloviec, okience – okienec, vajce – vajec);
* In the G pl of some nouns, in the last syllable of the stem the a / i / y / u / ä / e / o / syllabic r / syllabic l (without an acute or a preceding i) is changed into á / í / ý / ú / ia / / ô / ŕ / ĺ respectively (plece – pliec, srdce – sŕdc, slnce – sĺnc).

Notes on vysvedčenie:

Notes on dievča:
* The -a- at the beginning of all endings is replaced by ä after a labial consonant, i.e. p/b/m/f/v (for example žriebä – žriebäťa – žriebäťu...);
* Most nouns can take both the -at- endings and the -enc- endings in the plural (for example dievča, húsa, bábä), some nouns however take only the -at- endings (for example knieža, zviera, mláďa) and some nouns only the -enc- endings (for example kura). The following nouns do not take the -en- in the alternative plural endings: prasa (N pl prasatá/prasce, G pl prasiat/prasiec), teľa, šteňa.

== Adjectives ==

=== Paradigms ===

==== Pekný====
This paradigm is used for adjectives ending in a hard or neutral consonant + ý [in masculine]

==== Cudzí ====
This paradigm is used for adjectives ending in -a soft consonant + í [in masculine] (including the comparative and superlative, see below);

Forms: They are like with pekný, but within the endings (that is in what follows after pekn-) always replace ý by í, é by , á by ia, and ú by iu., e.g.: pekný – cudzí, pekné(ho) – cudzie(ho), pekný(m) – cudzí(m), pekná – cudzia, peknú – cudziu.

==== Otcov ====
This paradigm is used for adjectives ending in -ov / -in, for example &quot;otcov&quot; (&quot;father&#x27;s&quot;), &quot;matkin&quot; (&quot;mother&#x27;s&quot;). All of them are possessive adjectives (adjectives in -ov are derived from masculine nouns, adjectives in -in – from feminine nouns).

=== The Comparative and Superlative ===
The comparative is formed by replacing the adjective ending -ý/y/i/í by -ejší or -ší. There are exact rules for the choice between these two endings and there are several irregular comparatives. Examples:
: Regular: hrozný – hroznejší, bohatý – bohatší…
: Irregular: veľký – väčší, malý – menší, dobrý – lepší, zlý – horší, pekný – krajší, čierny – černejší, blízky – bližší, ďaleký – ďaľší, hlboký – hlbší…
The comparative forms are declined like cudzí.

The superlative (that is biggest, most difficult etc.) is formed as follows: naj+comparative. Examples: pekný – krajší – najkrajší, hrozný – hroznejší – najhroznejší...

The comparative and superlative of adverbs (which, by the way, end in -o, -e or -y in the basic form) is formed by simply replacing the -(ej)ší from the adjective by -(ej)šie (for example: pekne – krajšie – najkrajšie, hrozne – hroznejšie – najhroznejšie, teplo – teplejšie – najteplejšie, pomaly – pomalšie – najpomalšie).

== Pronouns ==

=== Personal pronouns ===
There is also the reflexive pronoun sa, which is declined as follows: N: –, G: seba, D: sebe / si, A: seba/sa, L: sebe, I: sebou

Notes:
* the long forms mňa, teba, seba, mne, tebe, sebe in G, D and A are used after prepositions (for example pre mňa) or when emphasized, especially always at the beginning of the sentence (for example Vidíš len seba., Teba vidím.);
* the forms jeho, jemu in G, D and A are used when emphasized, especially always at the beginning of the sentence (for example Vidím jeho. Jeho vidím = It is him that I see);
* the forms in n- (that is neho, nemu, nej, ňu, nich, nim, ne) are used after prepositions (for example pre neho (masc.)); the forms -ňho (or -ň), -ňmu, -ň can be used alternatively after the prepositions do, pre, na, za, o, po, do, u (for example pre neho (masc.) = preňho = preň); the special form -eň can be used alternatively (for neuter nouns obligatorily) after the prepositions nad, ponad, cez, pod, popod, pred, popred (for example nad neho (masc.) = nadeň).

=== Demonstrative Pronouns ===
like ten (that, the) are declined: tamten (that one), henten (that one), tento (this one), tenže (the same)...

like adjectives are declined: for example istý (certain, same), každý (each), iný (other), taký / onaký (such), všetok (all), sám (-self), onen (that one), and žiaden = žiadny (no one)...

=== Interrogative (and Relative) and Indefinite pronouns ===
:who: N: kto - G: koho – D: komu – A: koho – L: kom – I: kým [always masculine animate],
:what: N: čo – G: čoho – D: čomu – A: čo – L: čom – I: čím [always neuter];

like kto/čo are declined: nikto (nobody), niekto / dakto (someone), niečo / dačo (something), hocikto (who ever), nič (nothing), ktosi (someone), čosi (something)...

like adjectives are declined: čí (whose), niečí / dačí / hocičí (someone&#x27;s), ničí (no one&#x27;s), ktorý (which), aký (what, which), nejaký / dajaký / (some), nijaký / niktorý (no), čísi (someone&#x27;s), číkoľvek (whose ever). akýsi (some), ktorýsi (some), ktorýkoľvek (which ever)...

=== Possessive pronouns ===
The following are the first person pronouns.
like môj (my) are declined:
* tvoj (your (sg.)) and svoj (one&#x27;s own), except that the o never changes in ô (for example tvoj – tvojho...);
* náš (our) and váš (your (plural)), except that the -ô- in môj corresponds to an -á-, and an -o- in môj corresponds to an -a- here (for example náš – G: nášho – L: našom).

not declined are:
* jeho (his), jej (her), ich (their).

== Numerals ==

=== Cardinal Numerals ===

====Paradigms ====
jeden (one): declined like the adjective pekný;

* Changes for compound numerals in jeden: not declined; see Compound Numerals.

dva (two): N: dvaja (masc. animate); dva (masc. inanimate); dve (otherwise) – G: dvoch – D: dvom – A: dvoch (masc. animate); dva (masc. inanimate); dve (otherwise) – L: dvoch – I: dvoma;

* Also declined like päť: the numerals päť (6) to 19 (19), and 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and the second part of the compound numerals 25–29, 35–39 ... 95–99, if they are declined (see Compound Numerals).

100, 200, 300... 900; 1000, 2000, 3000... 9000: not declined, but 1000 can be declined like päť.

====Compound Numerals ====
* if they end in -jeden (for example 21, 101):
** not declined;
* otherwise:
** 2 alternatives: not declined or declined; if they are declined, then each number making up the numeral is declined according to its own paradigm (for example 23 chlapov: dvadsiatich troch chlapov).

===Ordinal Numerals===
They are declined like adjectives (paradigms pekný and cudzí).

Note: Ordinal numerals are formed by adding adjective endings to the (slightly modified) cardinal numbers, for example: 
:5: päť – 5th: piaty,
:20: dvadsať – 20th: dvadsiaty.

<text>The Society of the Spectacle () is a 1967 work of philosophy and Marxist critical theory by Guy Debord where he develops and presents the concept of the Spectacle. The book is considered a seminal text for the Situationist movement. Debord published a follow-up book &quot;Comments on the Society of the Spectacle&quot; in 1988.

==Summary==
The work is a series of 221 short theses in the form of aphorisms. Each thesis contains one paragraph.

===Degradation of human life===
Debord traces the development of a modern society in which authentic social life has been replaced with its representation: &quot;All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.&quot; Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as &quot;the decline of &quot;being&quot; into &quot;having&quot;, and &quot;having&quot; into merely &quot;appearing&quot;.&quot; This condition, according to Debord, is the &quot;historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life.&quot;

The spectacle is the inverted image of society in which relations between commodities have supplanted relations between people, in which &quot;passive identification with the spectacle supplants genuine activity&quot;. &quot;The spectacle is not a collection of images,&quot; Debord writes, &quot;rather, it is a social relation among people, mediated by images.&quot;

In his analysis of the spectacular society, Debord notes that the quality of life is impoverished, with such a lack of authenticity that human perceptions are affected; and an attendant degradation of knowledge, which in turn hinders critical thought. Debord analyzes the use of knowledge to assuage reality: the spectacle obfuscates the past, imploding it with the future into an undifferentiated mass, a type of never-ending present. In this way, the spectacle prevents individuals from realizing that the society of spectacle is only a moment in history, one that can be overturned through revolution.

In the Situationist view, situations are actively constructed and characterized by &quot;a sense of self-consciousness of existence within a particular environment or ambience&quot;.

Debord encouraged the use of détournement, &quot;which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle.&quot;

===Mass media and commodity fetishism===

&quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; is a critique of contemporary consumer culture and commodity fetishism, dealing with issues such as class alienation, cultural homogenization, and mass media. When Debord says that &quot;all that was once directly lived has become mere representation,&quot; he is referring to the central importance of the image in contemporary society. Images, Debord says, have supplanted genuine human interaction. Thus, Debord&#x27;s fourth thesis is: &quot;The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images.&quot; In a consumer society, social life is not about living, but about having; the spectacle uses the image to convey what people need and must have. Consequently, social life moves further, leaving a state of &quot;having&quot; and proceeding into a state of &quot;appearing&quot;; namely the appearance of the image. &quot;In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.&quot;

===Comparison between religion and marketing===
Debord also draws an equivalence between the role of mass media marketing in the present and the role of religions in the past. The spread of commodity-images by the mass media, produces &quot;waves of enthusiasm for a given product&quot; resulting in &quot;moments of fervent exaltation similar to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism&quot;.

Debord contends further that &quot;the remains of religion and of the family (the principal relic of the heritage of class power) and the moral repression they assure, merge whenever the enjoyment of this world is affirmed–this world being nothing other than repressive pseudo-enjoyment.&quot; &quot;The monotheistic religions were a compromise between myth and history, ... These religions arose on the soil of history, and established themselves there. But there they still preserve themselves in radical opposition to history.&quot; Debord defines them as &quot;Semi-historical religions&quot;. &quot;The growth of knowledge about society, which includes the understanding of history as the heart of culture, derives from itself an irreversible knowledge, which is expressed by the destruction of God.&quot;

===Critique of American sociology===
In Chapter 8, &quot;Negation and Consumption Within Culture&quot;, Debord includes a critical analysis of the works of three American sociologists. Debord discusses at length Daniel J. Boorstin&#x27;s &quot;The Image&quot; (1961), arguing that Boorstin missed the concept of Spectacle. In thesis 192, Debord mentions some American sociologists who have described the general project of developed capitalism which &quot;aims to recapture the fragmented worker as a personality well integrated in the group;&quot; the examples mentioned by Debord are David Riesman, author of &quot;The Lonely Crowd&quot; (1950), and William H. Whyte, author of the 1956 bestseller &quot;The Organization Man&quot;. Among the 1950s sociologists who are usually compared to Riesman and Whyte, is C. Wright Mills, the author of &quot;White Collar: The American Middle Classes&quot;. Riesman&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Crowd&quot; term is also used in thesis 28.

===Authenticity, plagiarism, and Lautréamont===
Because the notion of the spectacle involves real life being replaced by representations of life, &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; is also concerned with the notion of authenticity versus inauthenticity, a theme which is revisited in Chapter 8, &quot;Negation and Consumption within Culture&quot;. In Debord&#x27;s treatment, modern society forces culture to constantly re-appropriate or re-invent itself, copying and re-packaging old ideas. Thesis 207 makes this point, rhetorically:

&quot;Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author&#x27;s phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.&quot;

This passage concerning plagiarism is itself directly lifted from &quot;Poésies&quot; by French-Uruguayan author Isidore Lucien Ducasse, better known as the Comte de Lautréamont. In particular, the original French text for both Debord and Lautréamont&#x27;s versions of the passage are identical: &quot;Les idées s&#x27;améliorent. Le sens des mots y participe. Le plagiat est nécessaire. Le progrès l&#x27;implique. Il serre de près la phrase d&#x27;un auteur, se sert de ses expressions, efface une idée fausse, la remplace par l&#x27;idée juste.&quot;

===1983 edition===

The book cover of the 1983 edition is derived from a photograph by the &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer, J. R. Eyerman. On November 26, 1952, at the Paramount Theatre, the premiere screening of the film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; by Arch Oboler took place as the first full-length, color 3-D (aka &#x27;Natural Vision&#x27;) motion picture. Eyerman took a series of photographs of the audience wearing 3-D glasses.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine used one of the photographs as the cover of a brochure about the 1946-1955 decade. The photograph employed in the Black and Red edition shows the audience in &quot;a virtually trance-like state of absorption, their faces grim, their lips pursed;&quot; however, in the one chosen by &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;the spectators are laughing, their expressions of hilarity conveying the pleasure of an uproarious, active spectatorship.&quot; The Black and Red version also is flipped left to right, and cropped. Despite widespread association among English-speaking readers, Debord had nothing to do with this cover illustration, which was chosen by Black and Red.

<text>The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP, , XHKS, , ) was the ruling party of the Somali Democratic Republic from 1976 to 1991.

== History ==
SRSP was created by the military regime of Siad Barre under Soviet guidance. A founding congress was held in June 1976. The congress elected a Central Committee, with Barre as the party general secretary. A five-member politburo, consisting of Barre, Lt. General Mohammad Ali Samatar (vice president), Major General Hussein Kulmiye Afrah (2nd vice president), Brig. Ahmad Sulaymaan Abdullah and Brig. Ismail Ali Abukor (who was later replaced by Brig. Ahmad Mahamuud Faarah) was constituted. Party cadres also included prominent socialists such as Abdi Hashi Abdullahi, Abdulrahman Aidiid, Mohamed F. Weyrah and (a well known socialist economist) and Abukar Sh. M Hussien.

During a brief period, prior to the escalation of conflict with Ethiopia in 1977, the SRSP developed relations with foreign communist parties, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). CPSU initiated a programme of assistance for the SRSP party school. After relations with the Eastern Bloc were ruptured, a group including SRSP CC member broke away to form splinter groups. This was even further accelerated by the failed military coup of April 9, 1978, popularly known as &quot;Nova Aprile&quot;. In 1981 dissident factions would emerge as the Democratic Front for Salvation of Somalia.

When Barre&#x27;s regime fell in 1991, the SRSP dissolved. In the same year the Somali National Front was organized by Barre loyalists.

== Organisation ==
The SRSP was supposed to function as a political force transcending clan lines, but in reality there was little change in political practice. Power was concentrated to three clans. The party developed an intelligence branch, &quot;Baadhista xisbiga&quot;, which worked parallel to state intelligence and paramilitary groups. At most SRSP had around 20,000 members. The SRSP held its 3rd Congress in November 1986. A major reshuffle of the Central Committee took place.

== Role in Somali government ==

The Seventh Article of the 1979 constitution of the Somali Democratic Republic clarified the role of the SRSP:

<text>A source-code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE).

==Features==
Source-code editors have features specifically designed to simplify and speed up typing of source code, such as syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete and brace matching functionality. These editors also provide a convenient way to run a compiler, interpreter, debugger, or other program relevant for the software-development process. So, while many text editors like Notepad can be used to edit source code, if they do not enhance, automate or ease the editing of code, they are not &quot;source-code editors&quot;.

Structure editors are a different form of source-code editor, where instead of editing raw text, one manipulates the code&#x27;s structure, generally the abstract syntax tree. In this case features such as syntax highlighting, validation, and code formatting are easily and efficiently implemented from the concrete syntax tree or abstract syntax tree, but editing is often more rigid than free-form text. Structure editors also require extensive support for each language, and thus are harder to extend to new languages than text editors, where basic support only requires supporting syntax highlighting or indentation. For this reason, strict structure editors are not popular for source code editing, though some IDEs provide similar functionality.

A source-code editor can check syntax while code is being entered and immediately warn of syntax problems. A few source-code editors compress source code, typically converting common keywords into single-byte tokens, removing unnecessary whitespace, and converting numbers to a binary form. Such tokenizing editors later uncompress the source code when viewing it, possibly prettyprinting it with consistent capitalization and spacing. A few source-code editors do both.

The Language Server Protocol, first used in Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio Code, allows for source code editors to implement an LSP client that can read syntax information about any language with a LSP server. This allows for source code editors to easily support more languages with syntax highlighting, refactoring, and reference finding. Many source code editors such as Neovim and Brackets have added a built-in LSP client while other editors such as Emacs, vim, and Sublime Text have support for an LSP Client via a separate plug-in.

==History==
In 1985, Mike Cowlishaw of IBM created LEXX while seconded to the Oxford University Press. LEXX used live parsing and used color and fonts for syntax highlighting. IBM&#x27;s LPEX (Live Parsing Extensible Editor) was based on LEXX and ran on VM/CMS, OS/2, OS/400, Windows, and Java

Although the initial public release of vim was in 1991, the syntax highlighting feature was not introduced until version 5.0 in 1998. On November 1, 2015, the first version of NeoVim was released.

In 2003, Notepad++, a source code editor for Windows, was released by Don Ho. The intention was to create an alternative to the java-based source code editor, JEXT 

In 2015, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code as a lightweight and cross-platform alternative to their Visual Studio IDE. The following year, Visual Studio Code became the Microsoft product using the Language Server Protocol. This code editor quickly gained popularity and emerged as the most widely used source code editor.

==Comparison with IDEs==
A source-code editor is one component of a Integrated Development Environment. In contrast to a standalone source-code editor, an IDE typically also includes debugger and build tools.

Standalone source code editors are preferred over IDEs by some developers when they believe the IDEs are bloated with features they do not need.

==Notable examples==

*Atom 
*Brackets
*Eclipse
*Emacs
*Gedit
*NetBeans
*Notepad++ (Windows only)
*SlickEdit
*Sublime Text
*TextMate (macOS only)
*UltraEdit
*vi/Vim
*Visual Studio Code

==Controversy==
Many source-code editors and IDEs have been involved in ongoing user arguments, sometimes referred to jovially as &quot;holy wars&quot; by the programming community. Notable examples include vi vs. Emacs and Eclipse vs. NetBeans. These arguments have formed a significant part of internet culture and they often start whenever either editor is mentioned anywhere.

<doc id="1138017" wikidata="Q1290508" url="?curid=1138017" title="Southern Rock Opera">
<text>Southern Rock Opera is the third studio album by the American rock band Drive-By Truckers, released in 2001. A double album covering an ambitious range of subject matter from the politics of race to 1970s stadium rock, &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; either imagines, or filters, every topic through the context of legendary Southern band Lynyrd Skynyrd. The record was originally self-released on Soul Dump Records. The album was re-released on July 16, 2002 by Lost Highway Records. The album was financed by issuing promissory notes in exchange for loans from fans, family and friends of the band.

The album&#x27;s artwork was done by Richmond, Virginia artist Wes Freed.

==Origin and making of the album==
The idea for &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; pre-dates the band&#x27;s formation in 1996. &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; began in a long discussion between Drive-By Truckers&#x27; frontman Patterson Hood and former Truckers bassist and producer Earl Hicks, during a road trip. The pair discussed writing a semi-autobiographical screenplay about growing up in the South and about the plane crash that almost ended the career of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, taking singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and Gaines&#x27; back-up-singer sister Cassie Gaines.

Soon after this discussion, Hood formed Drive-By Truckers. The Truckers recorded two studio albums and one live album during the four years between their formation and the actual recording of &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;. During these years, Drive-By&#x27;s principal songwriters Hood, Mike Cooley, and Rob Malone continued to contribute songs to &quot;The Rock Opera&quot;, as they had come to call it.

After the release of their live album &quot;Alabama Ass Whuppin&#x27;&quot;, Drive-By Truckers began recording what they hoped would be their magnum opus: &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;. According to Patterson Hood, &quot;(the album) was recorded in Birmingham, upstairs in a uniform shop during an early September heat wave, with no air-conditioning. We had to turn the fans off when we were recording, and we worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. So &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; was fun to write, but we had a miserable time making it.&quot;

After the album was finished, however, the troubles continued for The Truckers when they ran out of funding for the immense project. To resolve the problem, and to avoid &quot;any fine print crap&quot;, as Hood put it, the band took a non-traditional approach. The Truckers made a prospectus and solicited investors, with a promise of 15% interest, to pay for the manufacturing and distribution of &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;. The approach worked. Through their fan-based online news group and by sheer word of mouth, The Truckers were able to raise $23,000. This allowed them to print about 5,000 copies of the album, and buy a &quot;new&quot; used van for touring. 

&quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; was finally released on September 12, 2001 on Soul Dump Records.

==Critical reception==

The album was voted the 22nd best of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop music critic poll of 2002.

The poll founder, Robert Christgau, named it his 23rd favorite album of 2001.

&quot;Rhapsody (online music service)&quot; ranked the album #6 on its &quot;Rock&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list.

The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Re-release==
The critical praise for &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; created no shortage of buzz around the album and the band. The Truckers did not have the means to press the necessary number of copies of the album on their own.

In order to meet demand, Drive-By Truckers signed a large-scale distribution deal with Lost Highway Records. &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; was re-released, this time worldwide, on July 16, 2002.

<text>The banded penguins are penguins that belong to the genus Spheniscus. There are four living species, all with similar banded plumage-patterns. They are sometimes also known as &quot;jack-ass penguins&quot; due to their loud locator-calls sounding similar to a donkey braying. Common traits include a band of black that runs around their bodies bordering their black dorsal coloring, black beaks with a small vertical white band, distinct spots on their bellies, and a small patch of unfeathered or thinly feathered skin around their eyes and underdeveloped fluff sack that can be either white or pink. All members of this genus lay eggs and raise their young in nests situated in burrows or in natural depressions in the earth.

Banded penguins belong to the genus &quot;Spheniscus&quot;, which was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the African penguin (&quot;Spheniscus demersus&quot;) as the type species. The genus name &quot;Spheniscus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word (&quot;sphẽn&quot;) meaning &quot;wedge&quot; and is a reference to the animal&#x27;s thin, wedge-shaped flippers.

== Species ==
=== Extant ===
The four extant species of banded penguins (&quot;Spheniscus&quot;) are:



=== Extinct ===

Several extinct species are known from fossils:
* &quot;Spheniscus anglicus&quot; (Late Miocene of Chile)
* &quot;Spheniscus chilensis&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Chile)
* &quot;Spheniscus megaramphus&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Peru and Chile)
* &quot;Spheniscus muizoni&quot; (Middle/Late Miocene of Cerro La Bruja, Peru)
* &quot;Spheniscus urbinai&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Peru and Chile)

The former &quot;Spheniscus predemersus&quot; is now placed in a monotypic genus &quot;Inguza&quot;.

== Range ==

Scientists believe that the genus &quot;Spheniscus&quot; originated in South America, even though the oldest fossils assigned to the taxon are from Antarctica. The oldest &quot;Spheniscus&quot; fossils are also the oldest penguin fossils from Antarctica. African, Humboldt, and Magellanic penguins all live in temperate climates. The African penguin lives in South Africa, the Humboldt penguin lives in coastal Peru and Chile while the Magellanic penguin lives in coastal Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands. Humboldt and Magellanic penguins are partially sympatric, since their ranges overlap in southern Chile. The Galápagos penguin is endemic to the Galápagos Islands, making it the most northerly of all penguin species.

== Vocalizations ==
Banded penguins use vocalizations for localization, socialization and to allow recognition for conspecifics or mates. Vocalizations in birds are produced by vibrations of the syrinx, located at the bottom of the trachea. These penguins are sometimes referred to as &quot;jack-ass&quot; penguins, since their vocalizations tend to sound similar to a donkey braying. Vocalizations in adult penguins can be classified into 4 distinct categories based on its acoustic properties and the behavioural context in which a vocalization is produced. The 4 categories of vocalizations include contact calls, agonistic calls, ecstatic display songs or mutual display songs.

=== Contact calls ===
Contact calls are vocalizations used primarily to maintain unity within a social group, to identify ones self and to maintain contact with a mate. Vocal individuality has evolved in banded penguins due to their large social group sizes. Contact calls are frequently used by banded penguins to form large flocks when foraging at sea. It is easy to become separated while diving for food, therefore these penguins use contact calls to stay in contact with each other when they are out of sight. A contact call can relay an excess of information about an individual penguin, including the penguins sex, age, social status within a group and emotional state.

=== Agonistic calls ===
Agonistic calls are vocalizations used when a banded penguin is demonstrating agonistic behaviour, which is characterized by aggressive interactions or fighting. Typically, banded penguins vocalize agonistic calls when defending a territory, such as their nest, against conspecifics. For nesting penguin species, such as banded penguins, the mating pair and their offspring are the only individuals allowed on their nest. Thus, any conspecific from the large colony that intrudes this territory will be a threat and an agonistic call will be produced.

=== Display songs ===

There are two types of display songs vocalized by banded penguins; ecstatic display songs and mutual display songs. Ecstatic display songs are the loudest and most complex vocalization performed by banded penguins. They are composed of a sequence of distinct acoustic syllables that combine to form a complete phrase and are often displayed during their breeding season. Despite the close relatedness of banded penguin species, the ecstatic display calls of African, Humboldt and Magellanic penguins are distinctly recognizable, even to human listeners. Typically, females respond more strongly to ecstatic display calls from their mates than from other conspecifics. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that ecstatic display songs may convey vocal individuality through the type of syllables the song produces. This vocal individuality can convey information such as body size and weight, since heavier penguins typically emit longer and lower-pitched vocalizations. Mutual display songs are similar to ecstatic display songs in that they are also complex sequences of acoustic syllables. However, mutual display songs are performed by mates at their nesting site.

== Source-filter theory ==
The source-filter theory is a framework used for studying the communication of mammalian animals through vocalizations. According to this theory, acoustic calls are produced by a source and then must be filtered to remove certain frequencies or leave others unchanged, which produces vocal individuality. In mammals, the source is the vibrations in the larynx and the filter is the super laryngeal vocal tract. However, birds use a different source and filter to produce vocalizations. They use a structure called the syrinx as their source of vibrations and their trachea acts as the filter. The source-filter theory has become increasingly popular to study birds, such as various species of banded penguins. This theory can be used to investigate how acoustic variation and individuality within a set of closely related species is attributed to distinct morphological differences in their vocal organs. The equivalence of the source-filter theory in humans is the source-filter model of speech production.

<text>The Sri Lanka spurfowl (Galloperdix bicalcarata) is a member of the pheasant family which is endemic to the dense rainforests of Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as  - in Sinhala.

It is a very secretive bird, and despite its size is difficult to see as it slips through dense undergrowth. Often the only indication of its presence is its distinctive ringing call, consisting of series of three-syllabled whistles. Kitulgala and Sinharaja are sites where there is a chance of seeing this bird.

This spurfowl is one of three species of bird in the genus &quot;Galloperdix&quot;. It is a ground nesting bird, which lays 2-5 eggs in a scrape.

Sri Lanka spurfowl is ~ 37 cm long bird. Both sexes have brown upperparts, wings and tail.

The males exhibit vivid crimson red legs and bare facial skin and striking black and white dorsal plumage that extends to its head. There is also extensive white ocellation on the sepia wings and upperback.

The legs of both sexes have multiple metatarsal spurs, which give rise to the specific name. The female has chestnut underparts and a plain brown back and wings. She is more prominently crested than the male.

Sri Lanka spurfowl is a seasonally terrestrial species, like most of its near relatives. It scratches vigorously amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor for invertebrates, especially mollusks and insects. It will also take various seeds, fallen fruit and spiders.
==In culture==
This spurfowl appears in a one rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.

<doc id="1138029" wikidata="Q492484" url="?curid=1138029" title="Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)">
<text>Ricardo Alexandre Martins Soares Pereira (; born 11 February 1976), known simply as Ricardo, is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He spent most of his professional career with Boavista and Sporting CP, helping the former to its only Primeira Liga title and appearing in 158 official matches with the latter, winning one Taça de Portugal. He moved abroad in his 30s, representing mainly Betis.

Ricardo won 79 caps for Portugal, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships, notably reaching the final at Euro 2004.

==Club career==
===Portugal===
Born in Montijo, Setúbal, Ricardo started his career at hometown club Montijo, signing with Boavista in 1995. After initially battling for first-choice status with William Andem he became first-choice, and appeared in 28 matches in the &quot;Chequereds&quot; 2000–01 conquest of the Primeira Liga championship, the club&#x27;s only title in its history.

Ricardo was one of the latter team&#x27;s most influential players in their 2002–03 campaign in the UEFA Cup, in a run that would only stop in the competition&#x27;s semi-finals. On 9 May 2003, through a penalty kick, he scored the only goal of the home win against Beira-Mar.

In the following off-season, Ricardo joined Sporting CP for a fee of €7 million and 20% from the value of any future transfer. An undisputed starter from his beginnings, he backstopped the side to the final of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, a 3–1 loss to CSKA Moscow (the game was played at the Estádio José Alvalade).

===Betis===

On 9 July 2007, Ricardo was linked with a transfer to Real Betis and, two days later, he signed a four-year contract with the La Liga club. His league debut took place against Recreativo de Huelva on 26 August, a 1–1 away draw; having started the season as first-choice, he eventually lost the position to trainee Casto, but would regain his status for two of the last three games as the Andalusians avoided relegation.

In 2008–09, as manager Paco Chaparro, who arrived midway through the previous season, started on the bench, Ricardo lost the battle for first-choice, having to settle with Copa del Rey matches, a situation which would revert midway through the campaign as Betis eventually suffered relegation. The following year he was backup to Iñaki Goitia, and made no appearances as his team finished fourth and were not promoted.

Ricardo was not given any shirt number for 2010–11, being limited to training with the Pepe Mel-led squad, and later released from his contract in January 2011 – it was due to expire in June of that year.

===Later career===

Ricardo started training with Football League Championship side Leicester City, and joined the team on 31 January 2011, signing until the end of the season, and citing manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as his motivation for making the move. He made his competitive debut on 12 February, in a 2–0 win over Derby County at Pride Park Stadium.

On 21 May 2011, Leicester confirmed it would not renew Ricardo&#x27;s contract, due to expire on 30 June. In mid-August, he signed for Vitória de Setúbal, returning to his country after four years.

Ricardo retired in 2014 after two years with Olhanense. He remained on the Algarve, settling in Vilamoura and setting up R1 Real Estate.

==International career==
Ricardo made his debut for the Portugal national team on 2 June 2001 against the Republic of Ireland, taking the place of Vítor Baía who was recovering from a serious knee injury. However, he would be his backup in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
At UEFA Euro 2004, played on home soil, Ricardo helped Portugal to defeat England in the quarter-finals on penalties: with the score at 5–5, he first saved the shot of Darius Vassell with his gloves off, and then scored the deciding penalty. In the final against Greece, however, he misjudged a corner when coming for the ball, and Angelos Charisteas headed the only goal of the game.

Ricardo kept two clean sheets in the 2006 World Cup group stage, only being beaten by Mexico&#x27;s Francisco Fonseca as the national side won all three matches. They once again knocked out England in the quarter-finals of a major tournament on penalties, as he saved from Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher in a 3–1 shootout victory after a 0–0 draw with extra time, becoming the first keeper to save three times in a World Cup shootout; the country finished fourth, and he was named to the tournament All-Star team as one of the three best goalkeepers.

Despite some criticism, Ricardo remained first-choice in Euro 2008, playing all of the matches as Portugal was eliminated by Germany 3–2 in the quarter-finals, where he misjudged two clearances which led to headed goals. After he lost his position at Betis he was not called up for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, being replaced by S.L. Benfica&#x27;s Quim and later Eduardo.

In March 2023, Ricardo was named the national team&#x27;s new goalkeeper coach alongside Iñaki Bergara, following the appointment of Roberto Martínez.

<text>Silvertown railway station was on the North London Line (NLL) serving the Silvertown area of east London, the station and the eastern section of the line it was on were closed in 2006. It was situated between Custom House (now a Docklands Light Railway and Elizabeth line station) and , the eastern terminus of the line.

==History==
Silvertown was opened in 1863 by the Great Eastern Railway, on the route of the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, with two tracks and platforms. A decline in use of the line led to the removal of one of the two tracks in 1980, leaving just one platform to serve trains in both directions. North Woolwich was also reduced to one platform. After third rail electrification of the line in 1986 by British Rail, services were increased and the single-track section became a bottleneck. Prior to closure, the typical Monday to Saturday service frequency westbound towards and eastbound towards North Woolwich was one train every 30 minutes during the daytime, increasing to one every 20 minutes in the evening; one train called every 30 minutes all day on Sundays.

In 1973 a government report on the redevelopment of London&#x27;s Docklands proposed an extension of the unbuilt Fleet line from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Woolwich Arsenal, with stations on each side at Custom House and Woolwich Arsenal. The proposal was developed during the 1970s as the Fleet line developed into the Jubilee line. Although approved in 1980, financial constraints meant that the route was not proceeded with. By the start of the 1990s new plans had been developed to extend the Jubilee line on a route south of the River Thames towards Stratford.

After London City Airport opened nearby there was an attempt to offer the station for connection to the airport, the station being renamed Silvertown and London City Airport on 4 October 1987, but the walk through adjacent side streets, and the relatively infrequent service, which was peripheral rather than into central London, led to little usage of the airport interchange.

The Docklands Light Railway Woolwich Arsenal branch now provides a substitute service for much of this part of the NLL; the nearest DLR station to the disused Silvertown station is London City Airport.

The remaining station buildings and platforms were demolished in 2012 as part of the construction of Crossrail, by Vinci, the contractor responsible for the reconditioning of the Connaught tunnel. Despite talk of constructing a replacement station nearby, this has not been provided for in the Crossrail Act 2008. Nevertheless, passive provision will be made for a station shortly to the east in the event of development of nearby properties.

Currently, there are proposals from London City Airport to fund the construction of a £50 million Crossrail station so as to serve London City Airport. However, Transport for London require a formal feasibility study from City Airport to be completed. This is so that progress of the Crossrail project would not be affected by station&#x27;s construction.

<text>Edward Stanley (1 January 1779 – 6 September 1849) was an English clergyman who served as Bishop of Norwich between 1837 and 1849. He set about combating laxity and want of discipline among the clergy.

==Early life==
Born in London into a notable Cheshire family, Stanley was the second son of Sir John Thomas Stanley , and the younger brother of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley.

Educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (16th wrangler, 1802), he was ordained in 1802 and three years later became rector of Alderley, Cheshire, a position he held for the next 32 years. While there he took a great interest in education, and encouraged especially the teaching of secular subjects at his school.

==Episcopal discipline==
In 1837 he was consecrated Bishop of Norwich and appointed Clerk of the Closet, holding both positions until his death. The diocese at this time was conspicuous for laxity and want of discipline, which he proceeded to remedy, although at first he met with much opposition. Ordinations and confirmations were held more regularly and frequently, schools were properly inspected, the Plurality Act, which prohibited the holding of more than one benefice by a clergyman except in certain cases, was enforced, and undesirable clergy were removed.

Stanley showed tolerance towards Dissenters and supported all missionary undertakings, without regard for their sectarian associations. In politics he was a Liberal and devoted himself especially to educational questions.

==Other work==
Stanley&#x27;s letters, &quot;Before and after Waterloo&quot; (edited by J. H. Adeane and M. Grenfell, 1907), are of interest to students of Napoleonic history.

Bishop Stanley was the original Patron of the Ipswich Museum and presided at its opening in 1847. A portrait of him in oils is displayed there. From 1837 to 1849 he was President of the Linnean Society.

==Death and succession==
Edward Stanley died in 1849 and was buried in the nave of Norwich cathedral.

He was succeeded by Samuel Hinds, a broad-churchman with strong associations with the Maoris of New Zealand, notably the Ngati Kuri and Te Patu tribes.

==Family==
On 8 May 1810, Edward Stanley married Catherine, eldest daughter of Rev. Oswald Leycester (from another notable Cheshire family). They had five children:
* Owen Stanley (1811–1850), Royal Navy officer and surveyor
* Mary Stanley (1813–1879), nurse and Catholic convert
* Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815–1881), priest and historian, Dean of Westminster
* Charles Edward Stanley (1819–1849), Royal Engineers officer
* Catherine Maria Stanley (1821–1899), married Charles Vaughan

==Cultural reference==
Stanley appears as a character in Alan Garner&#x27;s novel Strandloper.

<doc id="1138067" wikidata="Q2254542" url="?curid=1138067" title="Huskisson, New South Wales">
<text>Huskisson is a village in New South Wales, Australia in the City of Shoalhaven, on the shores of Jervis Bay. It is 24 km (14MI) south-east of Nowra.

==Etymology==
Huskisson was named by Governor Sir George Gipps, after the British statesman William Huskisson.

==Geography==

Situated alongside Currambene Creek which also serves as an anchorage and fishing port. Huskisson is a prime tourist destination owing to its white sands and emerald waters (although Hyams Beach to the south is known to have finer white sands).

The town is bounded by Currambene Creek in the north, Moona Moona Creek in the south, the Jervis Bay shoreline and its beaches in the east, and Jervis Bay National Park in the west.

==History==

=== Aboriginal History ===
The traditional owners of the area around Huskisson are a group of the Yuin. Well into the C20th, members of what local settlers called &#x27;the Jervis Bay tribe&#x27; lived on the bank of Currambene Creek. The &#x27;Jervis Bay tribe&#x27; are also known as the Wandandian people, They spoke Dharamba, which was probably the northernmost dialect of the Dhurga language. Huskisson lies very close to the linguistic boundary between the Dharamba dialect and the Thurawal language and the southern end of the traditional lands of the Thurawal people.

=== Origin of Huskisson ===
The origin of Huskisson dates to the early 1840s. The land south of Moona Moona Creek—now Vincentia—was the site of the settlement of South Huskisson, founded in 1841 as a seaport and terminus of The Wool Road. South Huskisson lay on land originally owned by Edward Deas Thompson and was a ‘private town’.

The land to the north of Moona Moona Creek was a ‘government reserve”. When South Huskisson was planned, it was envisaged that the land north of Moona Moona Creek would become a ‘government township’. Allotments were sold both in South Huskisson (in 1841) and in the new &#x27;government township&#x27; of Huskisson (in Feb.1843).

South Huskisson was not a success and was in rapid decline by 1850. Consequently, the &#x27;government township&#x27; of Huskisson failed to develop. By the mid-1850s, town allotments in both Huskisson and South Huskisson were essentially worthless.

Huskisson only began to grow, when it became the site of shipbuilding in the early 1860s. In its early years, Huskisson was often referred to as ‘North Huskisson’ reverting to Huskisson, once the ruins of its privately-owned southern twin town—by then referred to as ‘the Old Township’—had all but disappeared.

=== Shipbuilding ===

From 1864 to 1977, at least 131 registered wooden-hulled vessels were built in Huskisson, in shipyards along Currumbene Creek. That number does not include the many unregistered wooden-hulled vessels—such as small boats, punts, barges, and timber lighters—that were also built there during that period.

The shipyards built sailing vessels and steamships, including schooners, tug-boats, island-trading ships—for the firm of W.R. Carpenter &amp; Co., during the 1930s and 1940s—and two passenger ferries for Sydney (&quot;Lady Denman&quot; in 1911 and &quot;Lady Scott&quot; in 1914).

Up to the late 1940s, vessels were built using the ‘work frame’ method in which frames were created using timber from natural crooks in trees (not bent using steam as is more common now). Until 1940, the town had no electricity; all vessels were built without power tools, other than a steam-operated saw-mill used to make planks. Timber was locally sourced, generally from within a few miles of the town.

During the Second World War, the Huskisson shipyard built four wooden-hulled vessels for the American Army, for use in the New Guinea campaign. After the war, the old shipbuilding techniques gave way to more modern methods and in later years most vessels built were wooden-hulled fishing trawlers.

The main shipyard owners were, in earlier years, the Dent family, and later the Setree family.

=== Services &amp; Facilities ===
During the early days of the settlement, a post office operated at &#x27;Huskisson&#x27;, from January 1843 up to the end of December 1855.

<doc id="1138076" wikidata="Q808476" url="?curid=1138076" title="Barney Barnato">
<text>Barney Barnato (born Barnet Isaacs; 21 February 1851 – 14 June 1897) was a British Randlord and diamond magnate who was one of the entrepreneurs who gained control of diamond mining, and later, gold mining in South Africa from the 1870s up to World War I. He was known as a rival of Cecil Rhodes.

==Early life==
Barney Barnato was born Barnet Isaacs in Aldgate, London, on 21 February 1851, to parents Isaac and Leah Isaacs. He was educated by Moses Angel at the Jews&#x27; Free School and became a music hall entertainer and prizefighter. 

Barney grew up in Whitechapel. His mother, Leah, died in 1852. His father, Isaac Isaacs, made a living by selling second hand clothing and fabric remnants. Barney and his older brother Harry left school in their early teens and entered their father&#x27;s business. Their siblings were Kate, Sarah and Lizzie.

Barney and Harry performed on stage in the music halls. Harry was introduced as the Great Henry Isaacs and Barney as &quot;and Barnett too&quot;. They became known as Bar-na-to, or the Barnato Brothers.

==Career==
In 1873, Barney joined his brother Harry in the Cape Colony during the diamond rush, which accompanied the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley, and they eventually bought four claims in Kimberley. 

===Barnato Diamond Mining Company===

Initially, more than 3,600 claims were being mined at Kimberley. Over time, this number reduced to under one hundred. 

A French mining company, Compagnie Française des Mines de Diamants du Cap de Bonne Espérance, held a large block of claims that split the Kimberley mine in two. It was owned by a wealthy Parisian diamond dealer named Jules Porges. Barney telegraphed Porges, expressing interest in bidding if a sale was imminent. Rhodes bid £1.4 million to acquire the company. Barney countered by bidding £1.75 million. Before receiving a response from Porges, Rhodes contacted Barney and requested him to withdraw his offer.

In exchange for withdrawing the offer, Rhodes proposed to purchase the company at his original bid price and sell it to Barney for £300,000 plus a twenty percent holding in Barnato&#x27;s Kimberley Central Diamond Mining Company. After several days of consideration, Barney agreed to withdraw his offer, and a month later, he owned the French Company. Shares in Kimberley Central DMC surged from £14 to £49.

Rhodes proposed that they merge the De Beers DMC into Kimberley Central DMC, forming one company, De Beers Consolidated Mines. Barney emerged as the largest shareholder, with 6,658 shares in the new company. A group of shareholders from Kimberley Central applied to the Supreme Court of the Cape to stop the merger. The judge ruled in favor of the applicants. The result was that Kimberley Central was liquidated, and De Beers Consolidated purchased the company. The Barnato Brothers shares were bought out for the sum of £5,338,650 in 1889.

 De Beers Consolidated purchased two other mines in the area, Bultfontein and Du Toitspan.

By 1888, after the consolidation of diamond mining had taken place, the Barnatos were late in coming to Johannesburg. A dozen gold mining companies floated on both the London Stock Exchange and the new Johannesburg exchange. These mining shares were given the nickname &#x27;kaffirs&#x27;. 

With his nephews Woolf and Solly, Barney went on a buying spree, spending more than a million pounds in one year. Additionally, he invested in Johannesburg&#x27;s infrastructure. Early in 1889, Barney floated his first gold mining company on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. After the formation of his Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company that year, he went on a major acquisition plan.

Barnato doubled his fortune in the boom in South African gold mining shares of 1894–95 before losing most of it in the 1896 share collapse. He built, but never lived in, a vast house on the corner of Park Lane and Stanhope Gate in Mayfair, London, which was bought after his death by the banker Sir Edward Sassoon.

==Personal life==
Barney married Fanny Christina Bees. Together, they had three children:
*Leah &quot;Lily&quot; Primrose Barnato (1893–1933)
*Isaac &quot;Jack&quot; Henry Woolf Barnato (c. 1894–1918)
*Woolf &quot;Babe&quot; Barnato (1895–1948)
He was also the father of Isabel Louisa Barnato (born 5 June 1891, died 19 June 1891), daughter of Isabella Barnato (born Isabella Clarke 30 November 1865, died 30 October 1891).

===Death===
Barnato died in 1897; records state that he was lost overboard near the island of Madeira while on a passage home to England. Although, some have suggested that this was suicide, and that the Jameson Raid had taken a major toll on him and left him severely depressed. His family stated that it was totally out of character for him. Especially as a crew member gave evidence at the inquest that Barnato had been walking round the deck with his nephew Solly Joel at the time and as he fell overboard, his last word was &quot;murder!&quot;. Solly Joel who was suspected of stealing money from the company then inherited it on Barnato&#x27;s death. Barnato&#x27;s body was recovered from the sea and buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery in London.

The theory regarding the suicide of Barnato has also been tied to one of his heirs, his nephew Woolf Joel (1863 – 14 March 1898), who was shot and killed in his business offices in Johannesburg by a con-man named Karl Frederick Kurtze, who in 1898 went under the name Ludwig von Veltheim. In his trial for murder, von Veltheim hinted that he was supposed to be orchestrating a plot to kidnap Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Republic, that Barnato and Joel were backing. The murder stemmed from blackmail against Joel, but von Veltheim claimed he was only seeking his promised payment. As a result, von Veltheim was able to get an acquittal from a Boer Jury (possibly due to anti-British and anti-Semitic feelings towards the deceased). It was suggested by Brian Roberts, in his book &quot;The Diamond Magnates&quot;, that Barnato had been approached by von Veltheim too.

His fortune was divided up among his family, among which were his sister Sarah and her husband Abraham Rantzen, great-grandparents of TV presenter Esther Rantzen. Another beneficiary was his son, Woolf Barnato, who used part of the multimillion-pound fortune he inherited at the age of two to become a racing driver in the 1920s, one of the so-called &quot;Bentley Boys&quot;.

==Cultural depictions==
* Barney Barnato&#x27;s life was the subject of a South African television mini-series, &quot;Barney Barnato&quot;, made in 1989 and first aired on SABC in early 1990.
* He was the inspiration for the character Reuben Rosenthall, also an alliteratively named Jew who became rich through South African diamond mining, in the A. J. Raffles short story &quot;A Costume Piece&quot;.

<doc id="1138081" wikidata="Q3119819" url="?curid=1138081" title="Thorkell the Tall">
<text>Thorkell the Tall, also known as Thorkell the High in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (Old Norse: Þorke(ti)ll inn hávi; ; Swedish: &quot;Torkel Höge&quot;; ), was a prominent member of the Jomsviking order and a notable lord. He was a son of the Scanian chieftain Strut-Harald, and a brother of Jarl Sigvaldi, Hemingr and Tófa. Thorkell was the chief commander of the Jomsvikings and the legendary stronghold Jomsborg, on the Island of Wollin. He is also credited as having received the young Cnut the Great into his care and taken Cnut on raids. The &quot;Encomium Emmae,&quot; a document concerning significant individuals in the Anglo-Scandinavian court in the early 1040s, describes Thorkell as a great war leader and warrior.

Thorkell notably partook in a campaign that saw him lead an army to Kent in the summer of 1009, where they proceeded to ravage most of Southern England. This soon culminated in the siege of Canterbury in 1011 and the kidnapping of archbishop Ælfheah, who had previously converted Olaf Tryggvason, and Ælfheah&#x27;s subsequent murder at Greenwich on 19 April 1012. 

In the summer of 1015, Thorkell joined Cnut in his successful conquest of England, where he was promptly rewarded with the earldom of East-Anglia.

==Biography==
Thorkell is a historical figure, but his career, especially its early part, is steeped in associations with the legendary Jomsvikings. Thorkell took part in the Battle of Hjörungavágr in 986 and in the Battle of Swold in 1000.

In August 1009, a large Danish army led by Thorkell the Tall landed on the shores of Sandwich. They first marched towards the city of Canterbury but were promptly paid 3000 pounds of silver by the people of Kent to sway the army from attacking. They instead turned towards London and attempted to take the city several times, but were met with heavy resistance and ultimately abandoned their attack.

On 8 September 1011 the Viking army returned to Canterbury and besieged the city for three weeks, eventually taking it through the treachery of a man named Ælfmaer, whose life had been previously saved by the archbishop of Canterbury, Ælfheah. Thorkell and his men occupied Canterbury and took several hostages of importance, including Ælfheah himself, who was held prisoner for seven months. During the captivity, Ælfheah seems to have taken the opportunity to convert as many of the Vikings as possible to Christianity, prompting tension. The Vikings demanded an extra 3000 pounds of silver for the release of the archbishop, but Ælfheah bravely refused to be ransomed or have his people pay the invaders. As a consequence, Ælfheah was murdered by Thorkell&#x27;s men during a drunken feast at Greenwich on 19 April 1012: the Vikings pelted him with the bones of cattle before one Viking finished him off with a blow to the back of the head with the butt of an axe. Thorkell was said to have tried his best to prevent the death of the archbishop, offering the attackers everything he possessed to stop the killing, save for his ship. And someone, possibly Thorkell, is said to have carried the corpse to London the day after the murder. Thorkell&#x27;s army eventually ceased their attacks across Southern England, but only after a large series of danegeld payments were made, eventually culminating to 48,000 pounds of silver.

Disillusioned by the archbishop&#x27;s murder, and sensing that he was losing control over his men, Thorkell and several other loyalists defected, taking 45 Viking ships with them. He and his men subsequently entered into the service of the English King Æthelred the Unready as mercenaries, for whom they fought in 1013 against the invasion of Danish King Sweyn Forkbeard and his son Cnut.

It is not entirely clear how Thorkell became part of Cnut&#x27;s army prior to the Battle of Assandun in 1016, especially considering the former&#x27;s role in opposing Cnut and his father&#x27;s invasion of England in 1013 and escorting Æthelred the Unready into exile, but it is assumed that Cnut considered him a valuable asset and powerful ally. Given the Jomsvikings&#x27; role in political events in Scandinavia, the possibility exists that Thorkell played a masterminding role in assisting with Sweyn Forkbeard&#x27;s 1013 invasion and Cnut&#x27;s re-invasion a few years later. After the death of Edmund Ironside on 30 November 1016, Cnut became king of England and he divided the country into four earldoms – making Thorkell the Jarl of East Anglia.

In 1021, for unknown reasons, Thorkell is very briefly described as falling out with Cnut, with the former being banished by the king and returning to Denmark. However, Cnut later reconciled with Thorkell in 1023, seemingly aware of the strong connections and influence he had in his home country and that he was too powerful a man to be made an enemy of. As a result, he was granted the earldom of Denmark and given custody of Cnut&#x27;s son Harthacnut, to whom Thorkell would serve as foster-father. Thorkell&#x27;s rule was a short one, with Cnut&#x27;s brother-in-law Ulf the Earl to become Jarl of Denmark a year later. The perceived power vacuum of Thorkell&#x27;s unexplained absence after 1023 and the commitment of Cnut in England, prompted King Olaf II of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden to launch attacks on the Danish in the Baltic Sea. The Swedish and Norwegian navies led by kings Anund Jacob and Olaf II lay in wait up the river for the navy of King Cnut, which was commanded by Danish earl Ulf Jarl. Now known as the Battle of Helgeå, the decisive victory left Cnut the dominant leader in Scandinavia.

There is no mention of Thorkell after 1023, and he seems to have disappeared from the historical record. Maybe he was cast out of the kingdom to return to Jomsborg or Scania. Alternatively, he may have died soon after he was made Jarl of Denmark, presumably in 1024. One theory is that he was chased down by an angry mob, another that he was simply too old for any more conflict; the Jomsvikings were known to have men serving in the fighting ranks of age 18 to 50. With no military commands, the final years of his life could have been spent at court or on his estates. He may have died in battle in 1039, a year before his foster son Harthacnut joined Emma of Normandy in Bruges prior to travelling to England and claiming the throne.

Thorkell, celebrated in his lifetime by the poets, appears in the Jomsvikinga Saga and on runestones for his exploits. Thorkell&#x27;s proven shrewd nature and wisdom were well documented. The sometimes contradictory contemporary literature of the &quot;Encomium Emmae&quot; has Thorkell as being in service of, rather than the threat to, Cnut and Harthacnut&#x27;s authority. It is known one of Thorkell&#x27;s sons was a prominent member of Harthacnut&#x27;s retinue; after the collapse and subsequent death of Harthacnut at the wedding feast of Tovi the Proud in 1042, Thorkell&#x27;s wife and two sons were expelled from England. This was possibly linked to the intrigue that surrounded Magnus the Good&#x27;s letter of intention to invade the realm of Edward the Confessor, with the ambition to reunite the kingdoms of what is now described as the North Sea Empire.

==Family==
Thorkell may have married a daughter of Æthelred the Unready called Wulfhild or Edith, who was the widow of Ulfcytel Snillingr. Thorkell had a son who accompanied Cnut back to England in 1023.

<text>Ayr is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Burdekin, Queensland, Australia. It is the centre of a sugarcane-growing region and the administrative centre for the Burdekin Shire Council. In the , the locality of Ayr had a population of 8,603 people.

== Geography ==
Ayr is located south of Townsville on the Bruce Highway and away from the (smaller) town of Home Hill. It is north of Bowen and north of Mackay. Ayr is located near the delta of the Burdekin River. It is within the Burdekin Shire, which produces the most sugar cane per square kilometre in Australia, accessing underground water supplies and water from the Burdekin Dam to irrigate crops when rains fail.

Mirrigan is a neighbourhood within the locality (). It takes its name from the former Mirrigan railway station () which was assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 10 September 1914. It is an Aboriginal name meaning star.

Parkside is a neighbourhood within the south-east of the town ().

Ayr railway station () is on the North Coast railway line and is a passenger stop for the Spirit of Queensland.

Kalamia Sidings railway siding point is on the Kalamia Sugar Mill&#x27;s cane tramway ().

=== Climate ===
Ayr experiences a tropical savannah climate (Koppen: Aw), with a short wet season from December to April and a long dry season from May to November. The average annual rainfall is , primarily concentrated in the austral summer. Extreme temperatures in Ayr have ranged from on 2 July 1984 to on 7 January 1994.

== History ==
=== Aboriginal history ===
Biri (Birri) is a language of Central and North Queensland. Biri refers to a language chain extending from Central Queensland towards Townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. The language area includes the towns of Bowen, Ayr, Collinsville and Nebo.

=== British exploration ===
The first British exploration of the area occurred in 1839 during the third voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; where Captain John Clements Wickham travelled 10 miles up the waterway later known as the Burdekin River. His progress was stopped by a fishing weir built by the local Aboriginal people that spanned the river.
In 1843, during the surveying voyage of HMS &quot;Fly&quot;, Lieutenant John Ince, Joseph Jukes and Frederick Evans sailed up the river near to where the town of Ayr is now located. They encountered two large tribes of Aboriginal people with whom they had friendly interactions, exchanging items and participating in an apparent Welcome to Country ceremony. Artist, Harden Sidney Melville was also present, later drawing a depiction of the meeting.

Shipwreck survivor James Morrill lived with Aboriginal people in the region for seventeen years from 1846 when he was washed ashore on a makeshift raft. Morrill lived a traditional Aboriginal lifestyle and later made a culturally and historically important record of his experiences.

In 1859, Henry Daniel Sinclair, James Gordon and Ben Poole conducted a sea voyage that examined the mouth of the Burdekin River. They travelled about 8 miles up the river but were afraid to explore further as they were wary of the resident Aborigines and had limited firearms.

George Elphinstone Dalrymple led an overland expedition to the area in 1859 looking for land acquisitions and he returned again in 1860 as the head of a seagoing exploratory party. Dalrymple had several violent encounters with the local Aboriginal people during these expeditions. In 1862, Dalrymple made another journey to the lower Burdekin region concluding that the &quot;richly grassed open forest country&quot; would become &quot;a most valuable addition to the pastoral and agricultural resources of the colony.&quot;

=== British colonisation ===
The area was opened up to pastoral squatting leases in 1861 and in that year Edward Spencer Antill (who was a son of the distinguished colonist Henry Colden Antill) arrived in the region to take up land. In 1862, he selected a large area of land along the lower Burdekin River for a sheep station which he named Jarvisfield after the Antill family estate near Picton. Groups of armed settlers and Native Police started to force the Aboriginal people off the land around this time, with James Morrill documenting a massacre of a resident Burdekin River tribe. E.S. Antill bore a life-long scar on his forehead from a boomerang thrown at him during one of these episodes of frontier violence. Morrill attempted to negotiate a treaty between the British and the Aborigines whereby the coastal area on the north side of the Burdekin would be a reserve for the Indigenous people but this was ignored by the authorities.

After E.S. Antill had become established, other colonists took up land in the region, namely John Graham MacDonald who formed the Inkerman Downs property with the financial backing of Robert Towns, and Edward Cunningham who formed Woodhouse station. In retribution for murders and cattle spearing, punitive expeditions by the Native Police led by Lieutenant John Marlow would &quot;disperse&quot; the local Aboriginal population.

A township, named Wickham, was formed in the region in 1864 but was destroyed in 1870 during a flood. Robert William Graham formed the Lilliesmere run in 1876 and in 1881 the township of Ayr was laid out on this property by surveyor Ellis William Lymburner.

Ayr was named after the Scottish town of Ayr, the birthplace of nineteenth-century Queensland Premier, Sir Thomas McIlwraith.

Ayr Post Office opened on 25 August 1883.

=== Sugarcane plantations and mills ===

Large scale cultivation of sugarcane began in the region in 1879 with the formation of the Burdekin Delta Sugar Company through the partnership of local landholders Robert William Graham and Archibald Campbell MacMillan. Their plantation was called Airdmillan and in 1883 the Airdmillan sugar mill was built. Both the mill and the plantation became financially unviable in 1885 after the repatriation of kidnapped South Sea Islander labourers working on the plantation. Of the 532 Islanders brought to Airdmillan, 128 or 24% had died by 1885. In the 1890s, Airdmillan was subdivided and today much of the town of Ayr is located on what was once part of the Airdmillan estate. The nearby locality of Airdmillan is named after the plantation.

Other colonists also established plantations and mills in the region during the 1880s. James Mackenzie formed the Seaforth estate and mill, while Colin Munro built the Drynie mill. In 1882, John Spiller and Henry Brandon established the Pioneer plantation which was soon sold to the Drysdale brothers. The Drysdales built the Pioneer Mill in 1884 and later constructed the Inkerman Mill in 1914. Charles and John Young formed the Kalamia plantation in 1882, the Kalamia Mill being operational two years later. Much of the labour on these plantations during the early years was performed by South Sea Islanders, many of whom died in the first year after being shipped in. At Kalamia and Pioneer, the death rate was 14%, and at Seaforth it was 26%. Islander labour in the region was discontinued in the early 1900s.

The Pioneer, Kalamia and Inkerman mills are still operational and are owned by Wilmar Sugar.

Ayr Railway Station is the town&#x27;s rail-transit stop with regular services from Brisbane to Cairns. While the town has no public transport, several bus routes pick up school children across the region.

<doc id="1138088" wikidata="Q7712371" url="?curid=1138088" title="The Adding Machine">
<text>The Adding Machine is a 1923 play by Elmer Rice; it has been called &quot;... a landmark of American Expressionism, reflecting the growing interest in this highly subjective and nonrealistic form of modern drama.&quot;

==Plot==
The author of this play takes us through Mr. Zero’s trial, execution, excursion, and arrest going into the afterlife. During the whole series of this episodic journey, Mr. Zero is surprisingly oblivious to his deepest needs, wants, and desires. The story focuses on Mr. Zero, an accountant at a large, faceless company. After 25 years at his job, he discovers that he will be replaced by an adding machine. In anger and pain, he snaps and kills his boss. Mr. Zero is then tried for murder, found guilty, and hanged. He wakes up in a heaven-like setting known as the &quot;Elysian Fields.&quot; Mr. Zero meets a man named Shrdlu, then begins to operate an adding machine until Lieutenant Charles, the boss of the Elysian Fields, comes to tell Zero that he is a waste of space and his soul is going to be sent back to Earth to be reused. The play ends with Zero following a very attractive girl named Hope off-stage.

==Success==
The play was an influence on the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Stairs to the Roof&quot;. Years later, it was adapted into a 1969 film of the same name, written and directed by Jerome Epstein and starring Milo O&#x27;Shea, Phyllis Diller, Billie Whitelaw and Sydney Chaplin.

In 1989, Chicago&#x27;s Hystopolis Productions adapted Rice&#x27;s play for puppets; the production was hailed for its visual design. In September 1992, this production went on to be featured at the First International Festival of Puppet Theater presented at The Public Theater in New York which was a co-production of Joseph Papp and the Jim Henson Foundation. &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; remains part of Hystopolis&#x27; professional repertoire.

==Musical adaptation==

In 2007, the play was adapted into a musical entitled &quot;Adding Machine&quot; with a score by Joshua Schmidt and a book by Jason Loewith and Schmidt. The musical debuted in Illinois at the Next Theatre Company in 2007. It then opened Off-Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre on February 25, 2008, after previews that started on February 8. In September 2016 the musical was produced at the Finborough Theatre in London England.

<text>The National Portrait Gallery, also known as the National Portrait Gallery of Australia (NGA or NPGA) in Canberra is a public art gallery containing portraits of prominent Australians. It was established in 1998 and moved to its present building on King Edward Terrace in December 2008.

== History ==
In the early 1900s, the painter Tom Roberts was the first to propose that Australia should have a national portrait gallery, but it was not until the 1990s that the possibility began to take shape.

The 1992 exhibition &quot;Uncommon Australians&quot; – developed by the gallery&#x27;s founding patrons, Gordon and Marilyn Darling – was shown in Canberra and toured to four state galleries, igniting the idea of a national portrait gallery. In 1994, under the management of the National Library of Australia, the gallery&#x27;s first exhibition was launched in Old Parliament House. It was a further four years before the appointment of Andrew Sayers as inaugural director signalled the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery as an institution in its own right, with a board, a budget and a brief to develop its own collection. 

The collection was established in May 1998, and the inaugural director, Andrew Sayers, appointed. At that time it was housed in a few rooms in Old Parliament House and in a nearby gallery on Commonwealth Place. The opening of displays in the refurbished Parliamentary Library and two adjacent wings of Old Parliament House in 1999 endorsed the gallery&#x27;s status and arrival as an independent institution.

While the spaces of Old Parliament House proved adaptable to the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s programs, its growing profile and collection necessitated the move to a dedicated building. Funding for the A$87 million building was provided in the 2005 federal budget and Sydney-based architectural firm Johnson Pilton Walker was awarded the job of creating the gallery, with construction commencing in December 2006. The new National Portrait Gallery opened to the public on 4 December 2008 on King Edward Terrace, beside the High Court of Australia, by prime minister Kevin Rudd.

== The permanent collection ==
The portrait gallery contains portraits of prominent Australians (by birth or association) who are important in their field of endeavour, or whose life sets them apart as an individual of long-term public interest.

In 2020, the National Portrait Gallery’s permanent collection stands at approximately 3000 portraits across a range of mediums – including photography, painting, drawing, multimedia, sculpture and textiles – and continues to grow through an acquisition and commissioning program tied to a judiciously applied collection criteria.

==Prizes==
There are two exhibitions presented as the gallery&#x27;s &quot;National Portrait Prizes&quot;.

=== National Photographic Portrait Prize ===
The gallery’s National Photographic Portrait Prize (NPPP) is an annual award for Australian photographers, worth .

===Darling Portrait Prize===

In March 2020 the inaugural Darling Portrait Prize for painted portraits, featuring a winner&#x27;s prize, was established in honour of L. Gordon Darling AC CMG (1921-2015), who was a key founder of the National Portrait Gallery. This is a biennial prize.
;Winners
*2020: Anthea da Silva, for her portrait of dancer and choreographer Elizabeth Cameron Dalman
*2022: Jaq Grantford, for her self-portrait

== The building ==
Won through an open international design competition by Johnson Pilton Walker in 2005, the building provides exhibition space for approximately 500 portraits in a simple configuration of day-lit galleries.

The external form of the building responds to its site by using the building&#x27;s geometry to connect with key vistas and alignments around the precinct. A series of five bays, each more than long, are arranged perpendicular to the Land Axis referring to Walter Burley Griffin’s early concepts for the National Capital.

The National Portrait Gallery features a sequence of spaces leading from the Entrance Court defined by the two large cantilever concrete blades on the eastern side of the building, through the foyer to the fantastic gallery spaces. Each gallery receives controlled natural light from translucent glazed clerestory windows and views to the outside.

In April 2019, the gallery was closed for several months for rectification work to maintain the integrity of its building. The gallery reopened in September 2019.

==Governance==
The National Portrait Gallery of Australia (NGPA), usually referred to simply as the National Portrait Gallery (NGA), is an Australian Government agency, governed by the Board of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia (NGPA). the board is chaired by Penny Fowler.

===Directors===
Andrew Sayers was inaugural director, appointed in May 1998.

<text>Scott Francis O&#x27;Grady (born October 12, 1965) is a former United States Air Force fighter pilot. On June 2, 1995, he was shot down over Bosnia and Herzegovina by a 2K12 Kub (NATO designation SA-6 &quot;Gainful&quot;) mobile SAM launcher and forced to eject from his F-16C into hostile territory. US Marines from heavy-helicopter squadron HMH-464 and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit eventually rescued O&#x27;Grady after nearly a week of his evading the Bosnian Serbs. He was previously involved in the Banja Luka incident when he had fired upon six enemy aircraft. The 2001 film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; is loosely based upon his experience.

In September 2011, O&#x27;Grady announced a run for the 2012 Republican nomination for Texas State Senate District 8, held at the time by the retiring Republican Florence Shapiro, but he later suspended his campaign because of uncertainties over the Texas redistricting fight. In November 2020, President Donald Trump stated an official intention to nominate O&#x27;Grady as the next Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. The nomination was submitted to the Senate for confirmation on November 30, 2020. Before and during the nomination, O&#x27;Grady had spread numerous debunked conspiracy theories regarding the 2020 United States presidential election, and calls by Michael Flynn for Trump to institute martial law.

== Career ==

=== NATO: Operation Deny Flight ===

The Bosnian War was an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between April 1992 and December 1995. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to intervene in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made by various media organizations. NATO military involvement primarily involved enforcement of a no-fly zone codenamed Operation Deny Flight to discourage Bosnian Serb military aircraft from attacking Bosnian government and Bosnian Croat forces. In February 1994, Grady was involved in the Banja Luka incident where he, along with several other F-16 pilots, engaged Bosnian Serb jets who were in violation of the no-fly zone. Later, as part of the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy, he was piloting one of two F-16s patrolling the skies above Bosnia on June 2, 1995.

==== Shootdown ====
On the ground, a Bosnian Serb army 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile battery near Mrkonjić Grad was readying to fire its missiles on NATO aircraft. These Serbs had moved the mobile-tracked missile battery and laid a trap. They switched on their missile radars intermittently, giving F-16 fighters little warning. Waiting until a plane was directly overhead, where the aircraft&#x27;s warning and countermeasures would be at their weakest, they fired two missiles. In the cockpit, O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s instruments alerted him that a missile was coming, but, because he was flying through an overcast sky, he could not see it. The first missile exploded between the two aircraft. The second struck the F-16 piloted by O&#x27;Grady. His flight lead, Captain Robert Gordon &quot;Wilbur&quot; Wright, saw O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s plane burst into flames and break in two. Wright did not see a parachute, but O&#x27;Grady survived by ejecting from the aircraft.

O&#x27;Grady landed among a Bosnian Serb population that he was briefed would be unfriendly. He quickly secured a survival bag, ran, and hid. Rubbing dirt on his face, he hid face-down as Bosnian Serb forces came upon his parachute, half a dozen times shooting their rifles only feet from where he was hidden in an effort to flush him out or kill him.

During the next six days, he put to use the lessons learned during a 17-day Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training session he had undertaken near his hometown of Spokane, Washington. He ate leaves, grass, and bugs, and stored the little rainwater he could collect with a sponge in plastic bags.

O&#x27;Grady radioed for help immediately but had to remain quiet with paramilitaries coming within feet of him; he used the radio following standard operating procedures as the U.S. Air Force had taught him so as not to give away his position to unfriendly forces. On his 6th night on the ground he made radio contact, signalling his location using his radio&#x27;s limited battery power. NATO warplanes conducting sorties in the Balkans had been picking up beeper snippets that they thought could be coming from O&#x27;Grady. This extremely sensitive information was inadvertently revealed by General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, when the general told reporters attending a promotion ceremony that monitors had detected &quot;intermittent&quot; transmissions. A NATO official was quoted as saying &quot;I was dumbfounded he said that... I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, &#x27;We think he&#x27;s alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do&#x27;?&quot;

==== Rescue ====
Just after midnight on June 8, O&#x27;Grady spoke into the radio. An F-16 pilot, Captain Thomas &quot;T.O.&quot; Hanford, from the 510th responded and, after confirming his identity, the rescue was set in motion. At 0440 local time, USAF General Michael Ryan and Navy Admiral Leighton Smith, commander of NATO Southern Forces, called US Marine Corps Colonel Martin Berndt aboard USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; with orders to &quot;execute&quot;.

Two CH-53 Sea Stallions with 51 marines from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines within the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit lifted off USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; to rescue the pilot. The two helicopters were accompanied by two Marine Corps AH-1W Supercobra helicopter gunships and a pair of Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets, one piloted by Captain Ronald C. Walkerwicz. These six aircraft had support from identical sets of replacement helicopters and jump jets as well as two Navy EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes, two Air Force EF-111A Raven electronic warfare planes, two Marine F/A-18D Hornets, a pair of anti-tank Air Force A-10 Thunderbolts, an SH-60B from USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, and an RAF AWACS E-3D.

At 0635, the helicopters approached the area where O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s signal beacon had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O&#x27;Grady had set off a flare. The first Sea Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 Marines jumped off the aircraft and set up a defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion, commanded by Captains Paul Fortunato and James Wright, landed, a figure with a pistol who turned out to be the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.

==== Return ====
The Marines, with O&#x27;Grady, flew low over Serb-held Bosnia. However, American aircraft detected a Serb missile radar along the Croatian coast, scanning for targets. An American plane recommended destroying the Serb radar, code-named Giraffe. The request was denied, partly out of concern that a strike could spark wider conflict.

Minutes later, the Marines reported they were under fire. Three shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles had been fired at them but missed, as the helicopter pilots—flying off the ground at —jinked to evade them. Serb small arms pocked both helicopters; the Marines aboard heard the bullets hit inside the fuselage. One door gunner returned fire. One round hit some communication gear in the chopper and the bullet ended up against Sergeant Major Angel Castro Jr.&#x27;s armor without injuring anyone. At 0715 local time, 30 minutes after picking up O&#x27;Grady, the rescuers reported &quot;feet wet&quot;, meaning they were over water. O&#x27;Grady was back aboard the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; at 0730. All of the aircraft landed without further incident.

==== Aftermath ====

On August 11, 1995, a USAF RQ-1 Predator drone was shot down by Serb forces in the same area. The Serbs recovered the wreckage and handed it over to Russia for technical evaluation. On August 30, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force, a massive airstrike campaign which eventually lifted the siege of Sarajevo and led to the end of the war in Bosnia.

O&#x27;Grady received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for this mission.

=== Nomination: Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs ===
In November 2020, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate O&#x27;Grady to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs). The President justified this intent to appoint by citing O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s combat experience, his book &quot;Return With Honor&quot;, and Master&#x27;s degree in Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary and Honorary Doctorate of Public Service from the University of Portland in Oregon.

Shortly before and during the nomination period, O&#x27;Grady promoted conspiracy-theories about the 2020 United States presidential election, including claims that Trump won the election in a &quot;landslide fashion&quot;, that millions of votes were &quot;stolen from [Trump]&quot;, and that Hillary Clinton and George Soros were involved in helping foreign agents interfere in the election. Additionally, O&#x27;Grady signaled support for conspiracy theories by Sidney Powell alleging an international conspiracy of politicians, CIA agents, communists, and deceased former president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez working with Dominion Voting Systems to rig the election for Biden; retweeted attacks calling former Defense Secretary James Mattis a &quot;traitor&quot;; and endorsed a petition allegedly shared by former national security advisor Michael Flynn which recommended Trump declare martial law to overturn the election.

On January 3, 2021, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate.

===Defense Policy Board===
On December 14, 2020 the Department of Defense announced that the Trump administration nominated O&#x27;Grady to the Defense Policy Board, as a part of a slate of replacement nominations for the 11 board members who were abruptly fired in November 2020. O&#x27;Grady was sworn in as the board member on January 19, 2021, the last full day of Trump&#x27;s presidency, under pressure from the White House to complete his and other similar nominations. Following the election of President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a &quot;zero-based review&quot; of all the Pentagon advisory boards and fired all of the members appointed by the DoD, including all the Defense Policy Board members, effective February 16, 2021.

== Personal life ==
O&#x27;Grady was born in Brooklyn, New York City, a son of William P. O&#x27;Grady and Mary Lou Scardapane, and graduated from Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Washington. He is a former cadet in the Civil Air Patrol and a 1989 Air Force ROTC graduate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s campus in Prescott, Arizona. After his rescue, O&#x27;Grady transferred from active duty in the regular U.S. Air Force to the Air Force Reserve, where he continued to fly the F-16. In May 2007, he completed a master&#x27;s degree in biblical studies at Dallas Theological Seminary in Dallas, Texas. He resides in Frisco in Collin County, Texas.

O&#x27;Grady is an active Republican, having spoken at the 1996 Republican convention in support of Bob Dole. In 2004, O&#x27;Grady, supporting George W. Bush for re-election, accused Bush&#x27;s opponent John Kerry of &quot;treason&quot; for actions taken during the Vietnam War. O&#x27;Grady endorsed Brian Birdwell in his successful 2010 bid for the Texas State Senate, then launched his own candidacy for the Texas state house in September 2011, seeking the 2012 Republican nomination in Senate District 8 following the retirement of Sen. Florence Shapiro. O&#x27;Grady dropped out of the race in early 2012, claiming Shapiro had reneged on a promise to support him in the Republican primary, while his opponent had numerous endorsements.

== In popular culture ==
The shootdown incident was depicted and described on the documentary television program &quot;Situation Critical&quot; in episode No. 5, &quot;&quot;Downed Pilot&quot;.&quot; This has been shown on the National Geographic Channel. It was also covered in &quot;Escape! – Escape From Bosnia: The Scott O&#x27;Grady Story&quot; on the History Channel. The BBC also made a documentary, titled &quot;Missing in Action&quot;, that was later purchased by 20th Century Fox and Discovery Communications.

The 2001 film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, is loosely based on this event. Although O&#x27;Grady had given the film a positive rating on the film review television show &quot;Hot Or Not,&quot; O&#x27;Grady took offense at the portrayal of &#x27;his&#x27; character in &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; &quot;as a pilot who disobeys orders and swears&quot;. O&#x27;Grady sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for falsely misleading the public that the film was true to life. He also took action over the documentary, &quot;Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O&#x27;Grady Story&quot;, which was a re-edited version of a BBC documentary which Discovery Communications, parent company of the Discovery Channel, had purchased and edited. The documentary was broadcast several times on the Discovery Channel, and O&#x27;Grady accused Fox of using it to promote the film. Both suits were settled in 2004. Fox made a confidential settlement with O&#x27;Grady, while a Texas court ruled against O&#x27;Grady and in favor of Discovery Communications. The judge&#x27;s ruling stated, in effect, that the events in a person&#x27;s life are not the same thing as that person&#x27;s likeness or image.

O&#x27;Grady co-wrote two books, collaborating on one, with Michael French, that detailed his experiences of being shot down over Bosnia and his eventual rescue, &quot;Basher Five-Two: The True Story of F-16 Fighter Pilot Captain Scott O&#x27;Grady.&quot; He first wrote a book that was a New York Times Bestseller about his experience in &quot;Return with Honor&quot; with Jeff Coplon. Another book has also been written; this one, &quot;&quot;Good To Go:&quot; The Rescue of Capt. Scott O&#x27;Grady, USAF, from Bosnia,&quot; was written by Mary Pat Kelly.

<text>Elmer Rice (born Elmer Leopold Reizenstein, September 28, 1892 – May 8, 1967) was an American playwright. He is best known for his plays &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; (1923) and his Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of New York tenement life, &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1929).

==Biography==
===Early years===
Rice was born Elmer Leopold Reizenstein at 127 East 90th Street in New York City. His grandfather was a political activist in the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. After the failure of that political upheaval, he emigrated to the United States where he became a businessman. He spent most of his retirement years living with the Rice family and developed a close relationship with his grandson Elmer, who became a politically motivated writer and shared his grandfather&#x27;s liberal and pacifist politics. A staunch atheist, his grandfather may also have influenced Elmer in his feelings about religion as he refused to attend Hebrew school or to have a bar mitzvah. In contrast, Rice&#x27;s relationship with his father was very distant. As he wrote in his autobiography, his grandfather and his Uncle Will, both of whom boarded with the family, made up for the affection and attention his father withheld. A child of the tenements, Rice spent much of his youth reading, to his family&#x27;s consternation, and later observed, &quot;Nothing in my life has been more helpful than the simple act of joining the library.&quot;

Because of his need to support his family when his father&#x27;s epilepsy worsened, Rice did not complete high school, and he took a number of menial jobs before earning his diploma by preparing for the state examinations on his own and then applying to law school. Though he disliked legal studies and spent a good deal of class time reading plays in class (because they could be finished within the span of a two-hour lecture, he said), Rice graduated from New York Law School in 1912 and began a short-lived legal career. Leaving the profession in 1914, he was always to retain a cynical outlook about lawyers, but his two years in a law office provided him with material for several plays, most notably &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot; (1931). Courtroom dramas became a Rice specialty.

Needing to make a living, he decided to try writing full-time. It was a wise decision. His first play, &quot;On Trial&quot; (1914), a melodramatic murder mystery, was a great success and ran for 365 performances in New York. George M. Cohan offered to buy the rights for $30,000, a proposition Rice declined largely because he did not believe Cohan could be serious. Co-authored with a friend, Frank Harris (not the famed Oscar Wilde biographer), the play was purportedly the first American drama to employ the technique of reverse-chronology, telling the story from its conclusion to its starting-point. &quot;On Trial&quot; then went on tour throughout the United States with three separate companies and was produced in Argentina, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Scotland and South Africa. The author ultimately earned $100,000 from his first work for the stage. None of his later plays earned him as much as &quot;On Trial.&quot; The play was adapted for the cinema three times, in 1917, 1928, and 1939.

Political and social issues occupied Rice&#x27;s attention in this period as well. World War I and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s conservatism confirmed him in his criticism of the status quo. (He had been firmly converted to socialism in his teens, he said, by reading George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Galsworthy, Maxim Gorky, Frank Norris, and Upton Sinclair.) He frequented Greenwich Village, then the most bohemian part of New York City, in the late 1910s and became friendly with many socially conscious writers and activists, including the African-American poet James Weldon Johnson and the illustrator Art Young.

===Career===

After writing four more plays of no special distinction, Rice startled audiences in 1923 with his next contribution to the theatre, the boldly expressionistic &quot;The Adding Machine&quot;, which he wrote in 17 days. A satire about the growing regimentation of life in the machine age, the play tells the story of the life, death and bizarre afterlife of a dull bookkeeper, Mr. Zero. When Mr. Zero, a mere cog in the corporate machine, discovers that he is to be replaced at work by an adding machine, he snaps and murders his boss. After his trial and execution, he enters the next life only to confront some of the same issues and, judged to be of minimal use in heaven, is sent back to Earth for recycling. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson called it &quot;the most original and brilliant play any American had written up to that time ... the harshest and most illuminating play about modern society [Broadway had ever seen].&quot; Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woollcott were enthusiastic. Other reviewers spoke of him, hyperbolically, as a writer who might become America&#x27;s Ibsen. Directed with great ingenuity by Philip Moeller, designed by Lee Simonson, and produced by the Theatre Guild, the play starred Dudley Digges (actor) and Edward G. Robinson, then at the start of his acting career. Ironically, it made its author no money at all. (Adapted as an innovatively staged musical in 2007, &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; enjoyed a successful Off-Broadway run in 2008.)

When Dorothy Parker was at work on her play the following year (loosely based on fellow Algonquin Round Table member Robert Benchley, his marital problems, and the extra-marital temptations he was grappling with) and needed a co-author, she approached Elmer Rice, now acknowledged as the Broadway &quot;boy wonder&quot; of the moment. It was a smooth collaboration and resulted in a brief affair between Parker and the already-married Rice, begun at Rice&#x27;s insistent urging. The run of the play did not go smoothly, however; despite good reviews, &quot;Close Harmony&quot; (1924) closed quickly and was forgotten.

Rice was a prolific, even tireless writer. His plays over the next five years included the unproduced &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; (1925), &quot;Is He Guilty?&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Gay White Way&quot; (1928) and two collaborations, &quot;Wake Up, Jonathan&quot; (1928) with Hatcher Hughes, a dramatist unknown today and &quot;Cock Robin&quot; (1929) with Philip Barry, a Broadway name equal to Rice&#x27;s. None of these plays were a success. Rice was a theatre professional by this time: open to collaboration, increasingly interested in producing and directing his own plays. In the 1930s, he even bought a Broadway house, the famed Belasco Theatre.

Rice&#x27;s second hit (after &quot;The Adding Machine&quot;) proved to be his most lasting literary accomplishment. Originally entitled &quot;Landscape with Figures,&quot; &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1929), later the subject of an opera by Kurt Weill, won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for its realistic chronicle of life in the slums. &quot;With fifty characters casually strolling through it,&quot; Brooks Atkinson wrote, &quot;it looked like an improvisation...Based on the facade of a house at 25 West 65th Street, which Rice selected as typical, the tall massive setting caught the tone and humanity of a decaying brownstone.&quot; The script had been rejected by most producers who read it, and director George Cukor abandoned it as un-stageable after the second day of rehearsals. Rice took over the direction himself and proved that it was highly stageworthy, if unconventional in its narrative style and disorienting naturalism. Like &quot;The Adding Machine,&quot; the play&#x27;s break with the conventions of stage realism was part of its appeal.

Rice&#x27;s plays of the 1930s included &quot;The Left Bank&quot; (1931), a comedy dramatizing an expatriate&#x27;s superficial attempt to escape from American materialism in Paris, and &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot; (1931), a vigorous work that drew a realistic picture of the legal profession for which Rice had been trained. (The latter play is probably more frequently revived in regional theatres than any of Rice&#x27;s other plays.) In that decade, he also wrote two novels and enjoyed a lucrative period in Hollywood, writing screenplays. His time in Hollywood was not without its friction, though, as he was looked upon by many studio heads as one of &quot;those Eastern Reds.&quot;

The Depression-inspired, anti-capitalist &quot;We, the People&quot; (1933) was a play particularly close to Rice&#x27;s heart. It dealt with &quot;the misfortunes of a typical skilled workman and his family, helplessly engulfed in the tide of national adversity,&quot; as its author described it. Rice engaged an activist-minded cast and noted set designer Aline Bernstein to design the fifteen different sets that the ambitious play called for. &quot;We, the People&quot; failed amid what Rice called &quot;agitated&quot; reviews. A 1932 trip to the Soviet Union and to Germany, where he heard Hitler and Goebbels speak, provided material for Rice&#x27;s next plays. The Reichstag fire trial is an element in &quot;Judgement Day&quot; (1934), and conflicting American and Soviet ideologies form the subject of the conversation-piece &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; (1934).
After the failure of these plays, Rice returned to Broadway in 1937 to write and direct for the Playwrights&#x27; Company, which he had helped to establish along with Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, and Robert E. Sherwood. Of his later plays, the most successful was the fantasy &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1945) in which an over-imaginative girl encounters unexpected romance in reality. Rice&#x27;s last play was &quot;Cue for Passion&quot; (1958), a modern psycho-analytical variation of the Hamlet theme in which Diana Wynyard played a Gertrude-like character. In his retirement, Rice was the author of a controversial book on American drama, &quot;The Living Theatre&quot; (1960), and of a richly detailed autobiography, &quot;Minority Report&quot; (1964).

Rice was one of the more politically outspoken dramatists of his time and took an active part in the American Civil Liberties Union, the Authors&#x27; League, the Dramatists Guild of America where he was elected as the eighth president in 1939, and P.E.N. He was the first director of the New York office of the Federal Theatre Project, but resigned in 1936 to protest government censorship of the Project&#x27;s &quot;Living Newspaper&quot; dramatization of Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia. An outspoken defender of free speech, he left that position with a &quot;blast of scorn&quot; at the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s efforts to control artistic expression. (In 1932, Rice reluctantly supported the Communist Party candidate in the presidential election because he found Hoover and Roosevelt equally displeasing alternatives with an insufficient grasp of the crisis the country faced. though in subsequent elections he became an FDR supporter) He also spoke out against McCarthyism in the 1950s.

In the end, Elmer Rice did not believe he had been a success as a writer, not as he wished to define success. He needed to make a living and, while deriding the commercialism of the New York stage, he managed to earn a considerable amount of money, but at a cost to his more experimental vision. The realistic drama he could write with ease was at odds with the innovations that most intrigued him. &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; and &quot;Street Scene&quot; were anomalies and did not make money. An even more radical venture, &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; of 1925, was an episodic play without words, &quot;in which speech is indicated by gesture, by a series of situations in which there was no need for speech.&quot; The Theatre Guild turned the script down flat; Broadway would never be ready for the level of experimentation that inspired Rice, a reality that was a source of continuous frustration for him.

===Personal life===
Rice was married in 1915 to Hazel Levy and had two children with her, Margaret and Robert. After his divorce in 1942, he married actress Betty Field with whom he had three children, John, Judy and Paul. Field and Rice divorced in 1956.

Although born into a working-class family with no interest in the arts and known primarily for his attachment to theater and politics, Rice was passionate about Old Master and modern art. His art collection, slowly assembled over the years, included works by Picasso, Braque, Rouault, Leger, Derain, Klee, and Modigliani. He regularly frequented New York&#x27;s museums, and in his autobiography, wrote of his first trip to Spain and the powerful impact Velazquez had on him and, in Mexico, of enjoying the work of Diego Rivera and the Mexican Muralists, artists who shared his political views. He was close friends with Japanese-American modernist painter Yasuo Kuniyoshi.

Elmer Rice lived for many years on a wooded estate in Stamford, Connecticut until his death in Southampton, England in 1967 of pneumonia after suffering a heart attack. Obituaries took note of a long and respected theater career. Brooks Atkinson described Rice in his history of Broadway as &quot;a plain, rather sober man with a reticent, unyielding personality...But when a social principle was at stake, he was more clear-headed than most people, and he was quietly invincible...He was one of Broadway&#x27;s most eminent citizens.&quot;

== Archive ==
Elmer Rice&#x27;s papers were placed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1968, a year after his death. Additions have been made by family members over the years. The collection spans over 100 boxes and includes contracts, correspondence, manuscript drafts, notebooks, photographs, royalty statements, scripts, theater programs, and over seventy-three scrapbooks. The Ransom Center&#x27;s library division has over 900 books from Rice&#x27;s personal library, many of which are personally inscribed to or annotated by Rice.

==Film portrayal==
Rice was portrayed by the actor Jon Favreau in the 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;.

<text>A Bachelor of Mathematics (abbreviated B.Math, BMath or BMaths) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for successfully completing a program of study in mathematics or related disciplines, such as applied mathematics, actuarial science, computational science, data analytics, financial mathematics, mathematical physics, pure mathematics, operations research or statistics. The Bachelor of Mathematics caters to high-achieving students seeking to develop a comprehensive specialised knowledge in a field of mathematics or a high level of sophistication in the applications of mathematics.

In practice, this is essentially equivalent to a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree with a speciality in mathematics. Relatively few institutions award Bachelor of Mathematics degrees, and the distinction between those that do and those that award B.Sc or B.A. degrees for mathematics is usually curriculum related.

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Mathematics degrees==

<text>Baljit Singh &quot;Bally&quot; Sagoo (Punjabi: ਬਲਜੀਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਸੱਗੂ,) is a British-Indian record producer and DJ. Born in Delhi, India, Sagoo was raised in Birmingham, England. He entered the recording and entertainment industries in 1989. He is the figurehead of the UK/Belgium-based entertainment company, Fresh Dope Industries.

==Early life==
Sagoo grew up in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham. His father Saminder Sagoo ran his own retail music outlet in the 1970s, after playing in the Musafirs in the late 1960s.

In his teens, Sagoo developed a taste for reggae, soul and disco. He spent his college years producing mixtapes for friends and DJing at local events. These home-made creations fused Western dance and hip hop with Indian music.

== Career ==
In 1989, Oriental Star Agencies, a UK based record label, asked him to remix a Punjabi track called &quot;Hey Jamalo&quot;. The single became a hit and Sagoo joined OSA as their full-time in-house producer. Through this relationship, he released his first album, &quot;Wham Bam&quot; which spawned a sequel, &quot;Wham Bam 2&quot;. Other material during this period included &quot;Star Crazy&quot; and Sagoo&#x27;s 1991 collaboration with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on &quot;Magic Touch&quot;.Over 50,000 copies of &quot;Star Crazy&quot; were sold in UK and overseas market.

===1990s===
In 1994, Sagoo signed with Sony Records to produce &quot;Bollywood Flashback&quot;. He became the first Indian artist to reach national mainstream radio when the album track &quot;Chura Liya&quot; (a re-working of Asha Bhosle&#x27;s song) was played on BBC Radio 1. This was followed in 1996 by his first, all-original work &quot;Rising from the East&quot;, which included &quot;Dil Cheez&quot; and &quot;Tum Bin Jiya&quot;. Subsequently, he featured on the album &quot;Dance Attack&quot; and composed another remix music video, &quot;Mera Laung Gawacha&quot;. Starring Deepti Bhatnagar and Jas Arora, the video was directed by Polygram Multimedia, and became a hit in the UK. Sagoo made it onto &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He toured India with Michael Jackson on the HIStory World Tour, produced the &quot;Aby Baby&quot; album with Amitabh Bachchan and was invited to New Delhi to meet then Indian president, Shankar Dayal Sharma.

===2000s===
In 1999, Sagoo launched his own UK music label, Ishq Records. Its first output was his album, &quot;Dub of Asia&quot;. Ishq followed this with the release of other Sagoo titles including &quot;Anything But Silent&quot;, &quot;Hanji&quot; and the technical &quot;Sag Loops&quot; series. The label also managed and showcased other new talents and delivered tracks such as &quot;Noorie&quot; on Sagoo&#x27;s 2000 release, &quot;Bollywood Flashback 2&quot;.

In 2003 at the UK Asian Awards, the Spice Girls presented him with the inaugural trophy for Outstanding Achievement.

That decade, Sagoo&#x27;s music supported Gurinder Chadha&#x27;s &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, Mira Nair&#x27;s &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; (2001), the Aishwarya Rai and Dylan McDermott drama &quot;The Mistress of Spices&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Afterlife&quot;. Sagoo also starred in and composed the music for the 2006 Punjabi film, &quot;Sajna ve Sajna&quot;. He appeared in television programmes during the 2010s, including the UK Lottery show, the Asian reality show &quot;Bollywood Star&quot; and celebrity magazine formats such as &quot;Tinseltown TV&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2012, Sagoo opened a studio in Mumbai, and splits his time between the UK and India. He merged the business assets of Ishq Records into Fresh Dope Records, the music division of Fresh Dope Industries. It has a head office in Brussels and an operational satellite in Mumbai. It is engaged in feature film production, television, artist promotion and management, corporate participation, online and traditional publishing, live performances, lifestyle products, fashion trends and technology developments.

<doc id="1138103" wikidata="Q4894342" url="?curid=1138103" title="Bernie Brewer">
<text>Bernie Brewer is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team.

==History==
In late June 1970, when the Brewers were still a new team and having difficulty drawing spectators to their games at Milwaukee County Stadium, Milt Mason, a 69-year-old Brewers fan, decided to sit atop the scoreboard until the team could draw a home crowd of 40,000. He remained there for about 40 days. To the delight of a Bat Day crowd of 44,387 on August 16, Mason descended from his trailer following the Brewers&#x27; 4–3 win over the Indians. He slid down a rope from his perch, sustaining burns to his hands and legs. After a long illness, Mason died on June 12, 1973, but not before being recognized as the &quot;original&quot; Bernie Brewer.

The Bernie Brewer character became the team&#x27;s mascot in 1973, as a tribute to Mason, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache. In 1973, a beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd in cheering. The new chalet and beer mug made their debut at the home opener that season on April 14, 1973. The original date for the opener had been snowed out. Thereafter, following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he slid down and plunged himself into a huge beer mug in celebration, balloons rising into the air from the mug. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who playfully swatted at the backside of the opposing team&#x27;s third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths. 

Bernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but in a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original chalet has found a home at Lakefront Brewery, a local Milwaukee brewery and may be viewed during their brewery tour.

==Present==
At American Family Field, the current home of the Milwaukee Brewers, Bernie Brewer has his own &quot;dugout&quot; atop the bleachers behind left field, where he continues to lead the cheering at every home game. Currently he slides down a plastic white slide, no longer into a giant mug of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker&#x27;s trademark home run call (&quot;Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!&quot;) lights up above the Dugout. In 2009, Kalahari Resorts bought the rights to the bottom platform, and renamed it The Kalahari Splash Zone. Joseph and Cecelia S. of Milwaukee had their wedding ceremony in Bernie&#x27;s Chalet in 2008. They are the only couple to be married in the chalet to this day.

<doc id="1138104" wikidata="Q654736" url="?curid=1138104" title="Beverly Hills Cop III">
<text>Beverly Hills Cop III is a 1994 American action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy. The third film in the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; franchise, it was written by Steven E. de Souza and directed by John Landis. Murphy again plays Detroit detective Axel Foley, who returns to Beverly Hills and teams up with detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) to stop a gang of counterfeiters at a local amusement park called Wonder World.

The film features a number of cameo appearances by well-known film personalities, including Robert B. Sherman, Arthur Hiller, John Singleton, Joe Dante, Barbet Schroeder, Peter Medak, special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, and George Lucas as a ride patron. It is also the only film in the series not to involve producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who opted out of the film&#x27;s production due to budgetary disagreements.

&quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; was released on May 25, 1994 by Paramount Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, and was considered by Murphy himself as the weakest film in the series. The film also underperformed at the box office, grossing $119 million against a $70 million budget. A sequel, titled &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, was released on Netflix on July 3, 2024.

==Plot==
Seven years after the events from the second film Detroit Police Department detective Axel Foley plans to arrest a car theft ring at a chop shop. Unbeknownst to his superior, Inspector G. Douglas Todd, Axel cancels his SWAT backup, planning to use only his team for the raid.

Meanwhile, a group of four men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a stolen box truck; the leader of the group confirms the truck still has its cargo—crates apparently belonging to the U.S. government—then has his men execute the car thieves. The group prepares to leave when Axel and his team launch their raid, but are outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, is killed by the group&#x27;s leader. When the group flees in the box truck, Axel gives chase, but is intercepted by Secret Service Agent Steve Fulbright. He informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved.

After Todd&#x27;s funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in Beverly Hills, California, owned by &quot;Uncle Dave&quot; Thornton. Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood, now promoted to &quot;Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command&quot; (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Jon Flint, Billy&#x27;s new partner after John Taggart&#x27;s retirement. Flint calls his friend Ellis DeWald, head of Wonder World&#x27;s park security, to let him know that Axel is coming to the park for his investigation.

Axel befriends park employee Janice Perkins while touring the park&#x27;s behind-the-scenes facilities. He is observed by security, then shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Axel retreats to the surface, where he cuts in line to enter the &quot;Spider&quot; Ferris wheel ride. Axel rescues two children from the &quot;Spider&quot; after the guards accidentally jam the ride and is brought to park manager Orrin Sanderson. When DeWald is called in to contest Axel&#x27;s claim that he was attacked by the security guards without prior challenge, Axel recognizes DeWald as Todd&#x27;s killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe him because of DeWald&#x27;s impeccable public reputation.

Later, Axel is visited in his motel room by Uncle Dave and Janice. They inform him that the Wonder World park&#x27;s designer and Dave&#x27;s close friend, Roger Frye, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks earlier, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message. Axel and Rosewood attend a banquet to honor DeWald as private law enforcement officer of the year and meet Axel&#x27;s old friend Serge. Axel tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal activities, but DeWald resists Axel&#x27;s attempts.

Later, Axel digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park and learns DeWald and Sanderson are using Wonder World as a front for a counterfeiting ring. DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to collect mint paper stored in the truck. That evening, Axel meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and discovers that Frye&#x27;s warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, Uncle Dave is shot and wounded by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting.

After getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to a hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The ensuing shootout kills the rest of DeWald&#x27;s henchmen and leaves Axel, Rosewood and Flint injured; after a hand-to-hand fight Axel kills DeWald, avenging Todd.

In the meantime, Sanderson is killed by Agent Fulbright, who then appears before Axel to explain that he was right. Axel realizes the agent is involved with the counterfeiters, so he fatally shoots him after a brief struggle. Later, Axel, Rosewood, and Flint attend a special event at Wonder World, where Dave, having made a full recovery, thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World with his name, &quot;Axel Fox&quot;, while Axel begins a relationship with Janice.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
Asked in 1989 about a third installment, Murphy stated: &quot;There&#x27;s no reason to do it. I don&#x27;t need the money and it&#x27;s not gonna break any new ground. How often can you have Axel Foley talk fast and get into a place he doesn&#x27;t belong? But these motherfuckers are developing scripts for it. They&#x27;re in pre-production. The only reason to do a &quot;Cop III&quot; is to beat the bank, and Paramount ain&#x27;t gonna write me no check as big as I want to do something like that. In fact, if I do a &quot;Cop III&quot;, you can safely say, &#x27;Ooh, he must have got a &quot;lot&quot; of money!&#x27;&quot;

During the script&#x27;s early drafts, the plot concerned Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart going to London to rescue Captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox), who was being held hostage by terrorists during an International Police Convention. However, problems such as scripting issues and budgeting caused pre-production to slow to the point where both John Ashton and Ronny Cox had to drop out due to obligations to other film projects. Ashton&#x27;s part was re-written as John Flint (Héctor Elizondo) and dialogue was inserted to explain that Taggart had retired and moved to Phoenix. Cox&#x27;s character&#x27;s absence is never addressed in this film, nor is he mentioned. However, Ashton and Cox make subtle cameos in the form of a picture on Rosewood&#x27;s desk of Foley, Taggart, Rosewood, and Bogomil on a fishing trip. This is the same picture that appeared in &quot;Cop II&quot; on Bogomil&#x27;s and Foley&#x27;s desks. In an interview in 2012, Ronny Cox said, &quot;They wanted me to be in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;, but...I read the script.&quot;

Rejected ideas for &quot;Cop III&quot; included a Robert Towne screenplay (in which Foley has to deal with his celebrity status), a scenario teaming Murphy with Sean Connery as a Scotland Yard detective, and another Axel-in-London idea where his Scotland Yard counterpart would have been played by John Cleese. The last would have involved British gangsters, loosely based on the real-life Kray brothers, who were captured in Detroit and transported to London by Jeffrey (Axel&#x27;s friend from &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;, played by Paul Reiser), and Axel would have gone overseas after the gangsters&#x27;s henchmen broke them out of custody and murdered Jeffrey. This was scrapped because producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer decided it was too close to the story of Michael Douglas&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

When writer Steven E. de Souza was brought in, he originally wrote the story as more &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; in a theme park&quot;. He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for Murphy&#x27;s 1992 comedy &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot; came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million. Paramount had earlier told Simpson and Bruckheimer that they would only outlay $25 million for a proposed version to be set in New York City, one of the main reasons that the producing team parted ways with the studio. Joel Silver was set to take over producing duties from Simpson and Bruckheimer; however, negotiations on a large budget resulted in production delays leading to Silver quitting production. It was at this time that producers Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme took on the project. Consequently, the film became more about the investigation and less about the action.

Production was temporarily shut down to allow the Paramount top brass the chance to get to grips with the film&#x27;s spiraling budget. Originally estimated at $55 million, it was soon in excess of $70 million. Of that budget, $15 million was Murphy&#x27;s paycheck.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on September 8, 1993. The final chase scene through the &quot;Land of the Dinosaurs&quot;, featuring eleven animatronic dinosaurs, was filmed at Universal Studios Stage 37. Exterior scenes set in the theme park were filmed at Paramount&#x27;s Great America (now known as California’s Great America) in Santa Clara, California, after Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm declined permission. The three-armed Ferris wheel rescue scene used Great America&#x27;s Sky Whirl. One shootout sequence was filmed inside the Earthquake! ride at the Universal Studios theme park. The Sherman Brothers wrote the WonderWorld theme song. Filming wrapped on January 25, 1994.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

A soundtrack containing mostly R&amp;B music was released on May 10, 1994, by MCA Records. It peaked at 158 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 66 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. While Harold Faltermeyer did not return to score this film, his co-producer from the previous franchise entries, Keith Forsey, did produce and co-write a new song entitled &quot;Keep the Peace&quot;, performed by INXS. However, Nile Rodgers covered Faltermeyer&#x27;s &quot;Axel F&quot; in a breakbeat hardcore version.

This is the only film in the series not to feature a song performed by The Pointer Sisters, although &quot;Neutron Dance&quot; was used in the film&#x27;s trailer. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; featured their song &quot;Neutron Dance&quot;, while &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; had their song &quot;Be There&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; was criticized harshly and currently holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 58 reviews. The critical consensus reads; &quot;Despite being set at an amusement park, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; forgets to have any fun as it churns out uninspired violence and witless gags, with an uncharacteristically lethargic Eddie Murphy not helping matters.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, rated it 16/100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Richard Natale of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a return to form by Eddie Murphy&quot; that &quot;runs out of steam before the end&quot;. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is designed to be a foolproof and safe money-maker, but Murphy plays Foley too straight. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it D− and called Murphy&#x27;s performance &quot;joyless&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, for Landis as Worst Director and the film as Worst Remake or Sequel.

===Crew comments===
About the experience on making the movie, John Landis said:&quot;&quot;Cop 3&quot; was a very strange experience. The script wasn&#x27;t any good, but I figured, “So what? I&#x27;ll make it funny with Eddie&quot;. But then I discovered on the first day when I started giving Eddie some shtick, he said, &quot;You know, John… Axel Foley is an adult now. He&#x27;s not a wiseass anymore&quot;. So, with &quot;Beverly Hills Cop 3&quot;, I had this strange experience where he was very professional, but he just wasn&#x27;t funny. I would try to put him in funny situations, and he would find a way to step around them. It&#x27;s an odd movie. There are things in it I like, but it&#x27;s an odd movie.&quot;

In an interview in 1994, Eddie Murphy said that &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; is &quot;different from the trilogy&#x27;s first installment because Axel is more mature and no longer the wisecracking rookie cop.&quot; During that same year, Murphy said he thought &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; was &quot;infinitely better than &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2009, Bronson Pinchot claimed that Eddie Murphy &quot;was really depressed&quot; at the time &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; was being filmed, claiming that Murphy was low-spirited and had a low energy level.

Speaking on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, Eddie Murphy noted that the first and second &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; &quot;are really good&quot; while the third one lacked &quot;a great villain.&quot; Sitting down with Screen Rant ahead of &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, Murphy reflected on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop 3&quot;, and why it just didn’t work. He commented that the third entry in the franchise failed to connect with audiences due to the omission of Sergeant John Taggart (portrayed by John Ashton), and also because the stakes in the movie weren’t high enough compared to its two predecessors: “The reason &quot;Beverly Hills Cop 3&quot; was soft was because Taggart&#x27;s not in the movie, and the villain isn&#x27;t villainous enough, and Axel didn&#x27;t have any skin in the game. The first movie, Axel&#x27;s best friend is killed. And the second one, his friend, Captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox), gets shot. And then in the third one, his boss, chief Todd is killed but the focus is on Uncle Dave being in trouble. That&#x27;s what the movie&#x27;s about.”

==Sequel==
A fourth entry in the series was initially announced for release in the mid-1990s, under the production of Eddie Murphy&#x27;s own production company &quot;Eddie Murphy Productions&quot;, though production later fizzled out. It was re-announced in 2006, when producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced his intention to resurrect the film series, though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film, instead passing production duties to Lorenzo di Bonaventura. In September 2006 a script, an amalgamation of several earlier drafts, was presented to Murphy who was reported to be &quot;very happy&quot; with the outline which was described as an attempt to recapture the &quot;feel of the original&quot;. Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourth &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; film was to make up for the fact that the third film was &quot;horrible&quot; and that &quot;he didn&#x27;t want to leave (the series) like that&quot;.

In May 2008, &quot;Rush Hour&quot; director Brett Ratner was officially named director, who promised the film would return under the series&#x27; standard &quot;R&quot; rating, rather than as a rumored watered down PG-13. Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script, under the working title &quot;Beverly Hills Cop 2009&quot;, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Ratner stated &quot;I&#x27;m working very hard on the fourth. It&#x27;s very difficult, especially since there were three before. We&#x27;re trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I&#x27;m hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence.&quot; Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series&#x27; other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 that he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer&#x27;s &quot;Axel F&quot;, however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;ll be back but it&#x27;ll be a whole new interpretation.&quot; On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film, but that it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;anytime soon.&quot;

In October 2011, Murphy discussed a possible fourth film, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re not doing it. What I&#x27;m trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley&#x27;s son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I&#x27;d do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.&quot;

During late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film. On September 13, 2013, Jerry Bruckheimer stated he was in talks to produce. On December 6, 2013, it was announced that Eddie Murphy would again reprise the role of Axel Foley and Brett Ratner would direct. On May 2, 2014, Deadline announced that screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would be penning the screenplay.

On June 27, 2014, in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of Axel Foley after years of making family-friendly films. &quot;I haven&#x27;t done a street guy, working class, blue-collar character in ages so maybe it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Oh, wow, I didn&#x27;t remember he was able to do that&#x27;&quot;, Murphy said. According to studio reports on the film&#x27;s plot, Foley returns to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he&#x27;s faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America&#x27;s most tenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state. The film was supposed to be shot in and around Detroit and was estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016 release, but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled &quot;Beverly Hills Cop IV&quot; from its release schedule, due to script concerns.

On October 1, 2019, in an interview with &quot;Collider&quot;, Murphy confirmed that production on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop IV&quot; will commence once the filming of &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; has wrapped. On November 14, 2019, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that Paramount Pictures made a one-time license deal with an option for a sequel to Netflix to create the fourth film. By May 2020, after delays in the filmmaking business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Arbi and Fallah confirmed they are still attached as co-directors and that a new screenwriter was working on a new script for the film. In April 2022, Arbi and Fallah left the film to focus on &quot;Batgirl&quot; (2022), with Mark Molloy hired to replace them. In the same article, Will Beall was announced to have penned the script. The film was retitled &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, with filming commencing on August 29, 2022.

<doc id="1138105" wikidata="Q4907538" url="?curid=1138105" title="Bilal Skaf">
<text>Bilal Skaf () (born 14 September 1981) is a serial gang rapist who led groups of men to commit gang rape attacks against women and girls in Sydney in 2000.

For his crimes, Skaf is serving a 31-year prison sentence with a non-parole period of 28 years, and will be eligible for parole in 2033. He was originally sentenced to 55 years with a 40-year non-parole period, but that was modified several times upon appeal.

==Early life==
Skaf&#x27;s mother Baria worked as a cleaner and aged care worker, and his father Mustapha worked for State Rail in Sydney, gaining a good reputation among his colleagues. Bilal attended Strathfield South High School in Enfield, New South Wales and left school at 14 and worked as a spray painter before his father used his own good employment record to get his son on the State Rail payroll. This is despite Bilal having gained convictions for shoplifting, theft and carjackings.

==Gang rapes==

In 2000, Bilal Skaf led a gang that engaged in a series of gang rapes in Sydney against women and girls as young as 14 years. In 2002, nine men, including Skaf, were sentenced to a total of more than 240 years&#x27; jail.

Skaf was engaged at the time of his arrest and although his fiancée stood by him during his trial, she ended their engagement soon after his conviction. Skaf&#x27;s response was to sketch cartoons depicting his former fiancée being raped and murdered. Since he was first charged in November 2000, Skaf has remained unrepentant. During his trial, he claimed he was involved only in cases of consensual sex, laughed when his verdict was read and swore at the judge when he received his sentence.

On 16 September 2005, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal reduced Skaf&#x27;s 55-year sentence to a maximum of 28 years, with parole available after 22 years. NSW Attorney General Bob Debus decided that the government would seek leave for an appeal to the High Court of Australia against the sentence reduction. An earlier appeal had already reduced his sentence to 46 years, after a successful appeal against one of his convictions.

On 3 February 2006, the High Court refused leave to appeal, arguing that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had been left with no choice because of the many errors by the trial judge in sentencing Skaf to 46 years. That meant he could be freed at the age of 42 in 2023. A further appeal led to a 31-year sentence being imposed. Skaf will now be eligible for release on 11 February 2033.

==Family==
Bilal Skaf is the brother of Mohammed Skaf, also a gang rape attacker sentenced to 32 years&#x27; jail for his part in the attacks. Bilal and Mohammed are the sons of Mustapha and Baria Skaf, who emigrated to Australia from war-torn Lebanon in the 1970s.

In 2019, his brother Mohammed Skaf began his application for release to parole where Margaret Cunneen SC, who prosecuted the men, together with their lawyer Omar Juweinat urged that he be granted parole.

==Prison life==
Bilal Skaf began his sentence in Sydney&#x27;s Long Bay Correctional Centre but was soon moved to maximum security in Goulburn Gaol after prison officers uncovered plans by fellow inmates to inject him with HIV-infected blood.

In March 2003, he was charged with writing a threatening letter to Corrective Services NSW Commissioner, Ron Woodham. The letter had been found in an internal prison mailbox. The letter said: &quot;Don&#x27;t take this as a threat but if all Muslims aren&#x27;t released by January 2003 Australia and citizens will be in danger of bombing&quot;. White powder had been put into the letter.

While awaiting a court appearance for the letter incident, in July 2003, drawings of gang rape were discovered in Skaf&#x27;s prison cell. The drawings depicted violence and rape against his former fiancée, who had ended their relationship in March 2003. After she had cut all ties with Skaf, she was subjected to threatening phone calls and letters. She now says he can &quot;rot in hell&quot;.

According to prison guards, Skaf thought that he would be given a hero&#x27;s welcome by Lebanese inmates such as the gangland murderer Michael Kanaan. Instead, he was targeted by them for bringing disgrace to their community.

According to Commissioner Woodham, Skaf has not shown remorse for his crimes. He also says Skaf has warned prison officers to be careful outside of work, as they may be shot.

In April 2015, Skaf was attacked by two other inmates in jail and sustained &quot;serious facial injuries&quot;.

<text>Bundesgrenzschutz (; abbreviation: BGS; English: Federal Border Protection) is the former name of the German &quot;Bundespolizei&quot; (Federal Police). Established on 16 March 1951 as a subordinate agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the BGS originally was primarily focused on protecting the West German borders. During their early days, BGS units had military structures, training and equipment. The law enforcement officers legally had military combatant status until 1994. A major part of the early BGS personnel joined the newly founded German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) in 1956 and thus significantly contributed to West Germany&#x27;s rearmament. The BGS was renamed to &quot;Bundespolizei&quot; on 1 July 2005. The change of name did not have any effect on the legal status or competencies of the agency, but rather reflects its transition to a multi-faceted police agency with control over border, railway and air security.

==History==
The newly established Federal Republic of Germany wanted to set up its own federal border guard and police. The founding act of the Federal Border Protection (&quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;, BGS) was adopted on 14 November 1950 by the federal cabinet and on 15 February 1951 by the Bundestag. The BGS was established on 16 March 1951.

The Cold War had begun, but travel between East and West Germany was not yet restricted by the Berlin Wall (1961). German nationals could move freely from the DDR to the BRD in Berlin, but people attempting to cross illegally elsewhere were likely to be either commercial smugglers or espionage agents carrying contraband (e.g., radio transmitters.). Occupation authorities judged this could be better policed by a permanent force of Germans who intimately knew the border woods and mountains (rather than British or US troops who rotated out of Germany after a year or two) and at German rather than Allied expense. The BGS was organized along paramilitary lines in battalions, companies, and platoons, and was armed as light infantry. It remained a police force controlled by the Ministry of Interior rather than by the Ministry of Defense.

A maritime border protection unit (&quot;Seegrenzschutz&quot;) was formed as part of the BGS on 1 July 1951. It consisted of approximately 550 members and was equipped with fourteen large patrol craft and several helicopters.

On 3 October 1953 the Bundespasskontrolldienst (passport control service), which had been established on 19 September 1951, was transferred to the BGS and was now deployed on the entire German border.

The BGS was initially a paramilitary force of 10,000 which was responsible for policing a zone deep along the border. It eventually became the basis for the present national semi-militarised police force. On 19 June 1953 its authorized strength was expanded to 20,000 men, a mixture of conscripts and volunteers equipped with armoured cars, anti-tank guns, helicopters, trucks and jeeps. By 1956, it had a strength of 16,414 men. Upon the formation of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; in 1955, over 10,000 members of the BGS voluntarily joined the new German military in 1956. The &quot;Seegrenzschutz&quot; (Maritime Border Protection) was completely absorbed into the German Navy that year. A new maritime border protection unit was set up in the fall of 1964 as the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz See&quot; (BGS See; BGS Sea).

Although it was not intended to be able to repel a full-scale invasion, the BGS was tasked with dealing with small-scale threats to the security of West Germany&#x27;s borders, including the international borders as well as the inner German border. It had limited police powers within its zone of operations to enable it to deal with threats to the peace of the border. The BGS had a reputation for assertiveness, which made it especially unpopular with East Germans, who routinely criticized it as a reincarnation of the &quot;Zollgrenzschutz&quot; from the days of Nazi Germany. It also sustained a long-running feud with the &quot;Bundeszollverwaltung&quot; over which agency should have the lead responsibility for the inner German border.

The passing of the German Emergency Acts on 30 May 1968 relieved the BGS of its quasi-military tasks, because the Bundeswehr could now operate inside the Federal Republic in the case of an emergency. A military rank structure similar to that of the Bundeswehr was replaced in the mid-1970s by civil service-type personnel grades. The service uniform was green, but field units wore camouflage fatigues and, at times, steel helmets and military training was still carried out.
In 1972, the BGS became responsible for the security of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Bundespräsident (Federal President), the Bundeskanzler (Federal Chancellor), the Foreign Office, and the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Although the Compulsory Border Protection Service law is still in force, in 1974 the BGS became an all-volunteer enrollment force and in 1987 started recruiting women.

Among other things, it was equipped with armored cars, machine guns, automatic rifles, tear gas, hand grenades, rifle grenades, and antitank weapons. All personnel on border and security duty wore sidearms. Five units had light aircraft and helicopters to facilitate rapid access to remote border areas and for patrol and rescue missions. Some units were effectively Mountain troops because of their specialised training, equipment, and operational area (e.g., Bavarian Alps).

In addition to controlling Germany&#x27;s border, the BGS Alert police served as a federal reserve force to deal with major disturbances and other emergencies beyond the scope of the regional police. The BGS guarded airports and foreign embassies, and several highly trained detachments are available for special crisis situations requiring demolition equipment, helicopters, or combat vehicles.

The BGS consisted four border protection commands, which included a total of eight border protection groups: &quot;Grenzschutzgruppen&quot; (&quot;GSG&quot;) 1 through 7, along with a maritime unit.

After shortcomings in regional state police procedures and training were revealed by the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics, a BGS unit known as Border Protection Group 9 (&quot;GSG 9&quot;) was formed to deal with counter-terrorism incidents, especially hostage situations. The GSG 9 was not integrated into any of the existing groups. It won world attention when it rescued ninety passengers on a Lufthansa Flight 181 airliner hijacked to Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1977.


June 1990 saw the elimination of border patrols and control of persons at the Inner-German border. Upon German reunification on 3 October 1990, the East German &quot;Transportpolizei&quot; duties, and responsibility for air security in the new federal states, were taken over by the BGS. The German Railway Police (&quot;Bahnpolizei&quot;), formerly an independent force, was restructured under the BGS on 1 April 1992 in preparation for the railway&#x27;s privatization. The (formerly federally run) railway system remains a federal competency and Länder police forces have no authority over the railways. 

The strength of the BGS was 24,000 in early 1995.

<doc id="1138108" wikidata="Q431470" url="?curid=1138108" title="Civita di Bagnoregio">
<text>Civita di Bagnoregio () is an outlying village of the (municipality) of Bagnoregio in the Province of Viterbo in central Italy. It lies east of the town of Bagnoregio and about north of Rome. 

The only access is a footbridge from the nearby town, with a toll introduced in 2013. Because of the toll, communal taxes were abolished in Civita and nearby Bagnoregio. Due to its unstable foundation that often erodes, Civita is famously known as &quot;the dying city&quot;. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

== Territory ==
Civita is situated in the valley of the badlands (&quot;Valle dei Calanchi&quot;), a region east of Lake Bolsena and west of the Tiber Valley, in the municipality of Bagnoregio. It consists of two main valleys: the &quot;Fossato del Rio Torbido&quot; and the &quot;Fossato del Rio Chiaro.&quot; Originally these places might have been easier to reach and were crossed by an ancient road that linked the Tiber Valley to Lake Bolsena.

The morphology of this region was caused by erosion and landslides. The territory is made up of two different formations of rocks, different in chronology and constitution. The most ancient formation is that of clay; it comes from the sea and forms the base layer which is particularly subject to erosion. The top layers are made up of tuff and lava material. The fast erosion is due to the streams, to atmospheric agents but also to deforestation.

Civita, which is inhabited by only 16 people, is situated in a solitary area and it is reachable only by a reinforced concrete pedestrian bridge built in 1965. The bridge is generally restricted to pedestrians, but to meet the requirements of residents and workers the Municipality of Bagnoregio issued a statement that these people may cross the bridge by bike or by motorcycle at certain times. The reason for its isolation is the progressive erosion of the hill and the nearby valley which creates the badlands; this process is still ongoing and there is the danger that the village could disappear. This is why Civita is also known as &quot;The Dying Town&quot;.

== History ==

Civita di Bagnoregio was founded by the Etruscans more than 2,500 years ago. Formerly there were five city gates to access the ancient town of Civita, nowadays instead, &quot;Porta Santa Maria&quot; (known as &quot;Porta Cava&quot;, as well) is the main gateway of the city. It is also possible to enter the town of Civita from the badlands valley through a tunnel carved into the rock.

The layout of the whole town is of Etruscan origin, based on a cardo and decumanus orthogonal street system according to the Etruscan and Roman use, while the entire architectural cladding is of medieval and Renaissance origin.

There are numerous traces of Etruscan civilisation in Civita, especially in the &quot;San Francesco Vecchio&quot; area: a little Etruscan necropolis was found in the cliff located in the area below &quot;Belvedere di San Francesco Vecchio&quot;. The cave of St Bonaventure (where it is said that Saint Francis healed the little Giovanni Fidanza, who later became Saint Bonaventure) is also an Etruscan chamber tomb.

The Etruscans made Civita (whose original name is unknown) a flourishing city, thanks to its strategic position favourable for trade and thanks to its proximity to the most important communication routes of the times.

Many traces of the Etruscan period are still suggestive spots: the so-called &quot;Bucaione&quot;, for example, is a deep tunnel that goes through the lowest part of the city and gives access to badlands valley directly from the town.

In the past, many chamber tombs were visible. They were dug at the base of Civita&#x27;s cliff and nearby tuff walls and, over the centuries, they were destroyed by several rockfalls. Indeed, the Etruscans themselves had to face problems of seismic activity and instability, like the earthquake of 280 BC.

When the Romans arrived in 265 BC, they took up and carried on the rainwater drainage and the stream containment works that were first started by the Etruscans.

Civita (or City) was the birthplace of Saint Bonaventure, who died in 1274. The location of his boyhood house has long since fallen off the edge of the cliff. By the 16th century, Civita di Bagnoregio was beginning to decline, becoming eclipsed by its former suburb Bagnoregio.

At the end of the 17th century, the bishop and the municipal government were forced to move to Bagnoregio because of a major earthquake that accelerated the old town&#x27;s decline. At that time, the area was part of the Papal States. In the 19th century, Civita di Bagnoregio&#x27;s location was turning into an island and the pace of the erosion quickened as the layer of clay below the stone was reached in the area where today&#x27;s bridge is situated.

Bagnoregio continues as a small but prosperous town, while the older site became known in Italian as (&quot;The Dying Town&quot;). Civita di Bagnoregio has only recently been experiencing a tourist revival.

CNN in January 2020 associated the &quot;over-tourism&quot; with the mayor deciding to charge a minor fee for entry, which increased publicity and subsequently attendance. CNN also noted that the town had more feline inhabitants than its 12-human residents.

The only access is a footbridge from the nearby town, with a €1.50 toll introduced in 2013 and increased in August 2017 to €3 on weekdays and €5 on Sundays and public holidays. Civita had 40,000 visitors in 2010 and was estimated to attract 850,000 visitors in 2017. Due to the toll, communal taxes were abolished in Civita and nearby Bagnoregio, making Bagnoregio the only town in Italy without communal taxes.

== Location ==
The town is noted for its striking position on top of a plateau of friable volcanic tuff overlooking the Tiber river valley. It is in constant danger of destruction as the edges of the plateau collapse due to erosion, leaving the buildings to crumble as their underlying support falls away. , there were plans to reinforce the plateau with steel rods to prevent further geological damage.

=== Architecture ===
The city is also much admired for its architecture spanning several hundred years. Civita di Bagnoregio owes much of its unaltered condition to its relative isolation; the town was able to withstand most intrusions of modernity as well as the destruction brought by two world wars. The population today is 11 people, but due to several bed-and-breakfasts the village gets busy in the summer months.

The town was placed on the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s 2006 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites, because of threats it faces from erosion and unregulated tourism.

== Monuments and places of interest ==
Inside the village there are several medieval houses; the church of San Donato, which overlooks the main square and inside which the holy wooden crucifix is kept; Alemanni Palace, home of the Geological and Landslides Museum; the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, a mill of the 16th century; the remains of the house where St. Bonaventure was born and the door of Santa Maria, with two lions holding a human head between their paws, in memory of a popular revolt of the inhabitants of Civita against the Orvieto family of Monaldeschi.

In 2005 there was a proposal for the gullies of Civita to become a site of community interest.

== Economy and tourism ==
Thanks to its evocative geographical position and its medieval buildings, the town attracts many tourists, and several times it has been used as a movie set.

In January 2021, the mayor of Bagnoregio submitted a proposal to UNESCO to designate Civita a World Heritage Site.

== Culture ==

=== The Holy Crucifix of Civita ===
On Good Friday, the Holy Crucifix is laid on a coffin in the church of San Donato to be transported in the centuries-old &quot;Processione del Venerdì Santo di Bagnoregio&quot; (&quot;Good Friday Procession of Bagnoregio&quot;). The legend narrates that during a plague epidemic, which in 1449 hit the whole territory around Bagnoregio, the cross talked to a pious woman, who went every day before the venerated image asking with her prayers for the end of that agony. One day, while the woman was praying to Christ, she heard a voice that reassured her, saying that the Lord had fulfilled her prayers and that the pestilence would end. And indeed, after a few days, the plague was over, at the same time as the death of the pious woman.

<doc id="1138114" wikidata="Q1066568" url="?curid=1138114" title="Charles Sibthorp">
<text>Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp (14 February 1783 – 14 December 1855), popularly known as Colonel Sibthorp, was a widely caricatured British Ultra-Tory politician in the early 19th century. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Lincoln from 1826 to 1832 and from 1835 until 1855.

Sibthorp was born into a Lincoln gentry family, the son of Colonel Humphrey Waldo Sibthorp, of Canwick Hall, by his wife Susannah, daughter of Richard Ellison, of Sudbrooke Holme, Lincolnshire. Charles&#x27;s brother, Richard Waldo Sibthorp (1792–1879), was an Anglican priest who gained notoriety for his 1841 conversion to Roman Catholicism (and who subsequently returned to the Anglican Church). He was commissioned into the Scots Greys in 1803, promoted lieutenant in 1806, and later transferred to the 4th Dragoon Guards, in which he reached the rank of captain. He did not serve abroad and continued in the service until 1822, when he succeeded to the family estates and also succeeded his brother as Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal South Lincolnshire Militia. In 1812, he married Maria Tottenham, daughter and co-heiress of Ponsonby Tottenham, MP for Fethard, County Wexford; they had four children.

==Member of Parliament==
During Sibthorp&#x27;s three decades in Parliament, he became renowned, along with Sir Robert Inglis, as one of its most reactionary members. He stoutly opposed Catholic Emancipation, Emancipation of the Jews in England, the Reform Act 1832, the repeal of the Corn Laws, the 1851 Great Exhibition and the construction of the National Gallery. He was convinced that any changes from the Britain of his youth (in the late 18th century) were signs of degeneracy, that Britain was about to go bankrupt, and that the new railways were a passing fad which would soon give way to a return to &quot;chaises, carriages and stages&quot;.

He was opposed to all foreign influences, and offended Queen Victoria with his public suspicions of Prince Albert, the prince consort. His political views, his bluntness in expressing them, and his eccentricities made him the target of both witticisms and cartoons in &quot;Punch&quot;.

He was returned to Parliament on eight occasions.

Sibthorp died at his home in London, and was succeeded as MP by his son, Gervaise Waldo-Sibthorp.

<text>The committees of correspondence were a collection of American political organizations that sought to coordinate opposition to British Parliament and, later, support for American independence during the American Revolution. The brainchild of Samuel Adams, a Patriot from Boston, the committees sought to establish, through the writing of letters, an underground network of communication among Patriot leaders in the Thirteen Colonies. The committees were instrumental in setting up the First Continental Congress, which convened in Philadelphia in September and October 1774.

== Function ==
The function of the committees was to alert the residents of a given colony of the actions taken by the British Crown, and to disseminate information from cities to the countryside. The news was typically spread via hand-written letters or printed pamphlets, which would be carried by couriers on horseback or aboard ships. The committees were responsible for ensuring that this news accurately reflected the views of Patriots, and was dispatched to the proper receiving groups. Many correspondents were members of colonial legislative assemblies, and others were also active in the Sons of Liberty and Stamp Act Congress.

A total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on these committees at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities; Loyalists were naturally excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to Great Britain, and largely directed the Revolutionary War effort at the state and local level. 

The committees promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries, and lead a more simple life. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. In late 1774 and early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which began the operation of a true colonial government.

==History==
The first committees of correspondence were established in Boston in 1764 to rally opposition to the Currency Act and unpopular reforms imposed on the customs service.

During the Stamp Act crisis the following year, the Province of New York formed a committee to urge common resistance among its neighbors to the new taxes. The Province of Massachusetts Bay&#x27;s correspondents responded by urging other colonies to send delegates to the Stamp Act Congress that fall. The resulting committees disbanded after the crisis was over.

Pro-revolutionary Patriot leaders in Boston, believing they were confronting increasingly hostile threats by the British royal government, established the first long-standing committee with the approval of a town meeting in late 1772. By spring 1773, Patriots decided to follow the Massachusetts system and began to set up their own committees in each colony. The Colony of Virginia appointed an eleven-member committee in March, quickly followed by the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, the Province of New Hampshire, and the Province of South Carolina. By February 1774, 11 colonies had set up their own committees; of the thirteen colonies that eventually rebelled, only the provinces of North Carolina and Pennsylvania did not.

===Delaware===

In Delaware Colony, a committee of correspondence was established by Thomas McKean after ten years of agitation centered in New Castle County. In neighboring Kent County, Caesar Rodney set up a second committee, followed by Sussex County. Following the recommendation of the First Continental Congress in 1774, the committees were replaced by elected &quot;committees of inspection&quot; with a subcommittee of correspondence. The new committees specialized in intelligence work, especially the identification of men opposed to the Patriot cause. The committees were a driving force in popularizing the demand for independence.

The correspondence committees exchanged information with others in Boston, Philadelphia, and elsewhere. Their leadership was often drawn upon to provide Delaware with executive leaders. The committees of inspection used publicity as weapons to suppress disaffection and encourage patriotism. With imports from Britain cut off, the committees sought to make America self-sufficient, so they encouraged the cultivation of flax and the raising of sheep for wool. The committees helped organize local militia in the hundreds and later in the counties and all of Delaware. With their encouragement, the Delaware Assembly elected delegates to Continental Congress favorable to independence.

===Massachusetts===

In November 1772 in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren, and Mercy Otis Warren formed a committee in response to the &quot;Gaspée&quot; Affair and to the recent British decision to have the salaries of the royal governor and judges be paid by the British Crown rather than the colonial assembly, a measure which effectively stripped the colony of its means of holding public officials accountable to their constituents.

In the following months, more than one hundred other committees were formed in towns and villages throughout Massachusetts. The Massachusetts committee&#x27;s headquarters, based in Boston and led by Adams, became a model for other Patriot groups. The meeting establishing the committee set its purpose, outlining &quot;the rights of the colonists, and of this province in particular, as men, as Christians, and as subjects; to communicate and publish the same to the several towns in this province and to the world as the sense of this town.&quot;

===Maryland===

The Province of Maryland became the eighth of the thirteen colonies to appoint a committee of correspondence on October 15, 1773. The Maryland committee stated that there was an &quot;absolute necessity of a general and firm union of sister colonies to preserve common liberties&quot;, and called for a meeting of this union to be held in Philadelphia.

===New York===

In response to the news that the Port of Boston would be closed under the Boston Port Act, an advertisement was posted at the coffee house on Wall Street in New York City, a noted place of resort for shipmasters and merchants, inviting merchants to meet on May 16, 1774, at the Fraunces Tavern &quot;in order to consult on measures proper to be pursued on the present critical and important situation.&quot; At the meeting, chaired by Isaac Low, the committee resolved to nominate a 50-member committee of correspondence to be submitted to the public. On May 17, 1774, they published a notice calling on the public to meet at the coffee house on May 19 at 1 p.m. to approve the committee and appoint others as they may see fit. At the meeting on May 19, Francis Lewis was also nominated and the entire Committee of Fifty-one was confirmed.

On May 23, 1774, the committee met at the coffee house and appointed Isaac Low as permanent chairman and John Alsop as deputy chairman. The committee then formed a subcommittee, which produced a letter in response to the letters from Boston, calling for a &quot;Congress of Deputies from the Colonies&quot; to be assembled, which became known as the First Continental Congress and was approved by the committee.

On May 30, 1774, the Committee formed a subcommittee to write a letter to the supervisors of New York&#x27;s counties to exhort them to also form similar committees of correspondence, which was adopted in a meeting of the Committee on May 31.

On July 4, 1774, a resolution was approved to appoint five delegates contingent upon their confirmation by the freeholders of the City and County of New York, and to request that the other counties also send delegates. Isaac Low, John Alsop, James Duane, Philip Livingston, and John Jay were then appointed, and the public of the City and County was invited to attend City Hall and approve the appointments on July 7. This caused friction with the more radical Sons of Liberty, known as the Committee of Mechanics faction, who held a meeting in the fields on July 6. Three counties, Westchester, Duchess, and Albany acquiesced to the five delegates, while three counties, Kings, Suffolk, and Orange, sent delegates of their own.

===North Carolina===

By 1773, the political situation had deteriorated. There was concern about the courts. Massachusetts&#x27; young and ardent Boston patriot, Josiah Quincy Jr., visited North Carolina for five days. He spent the night of March 26, 1773, at Cornelius Harnett&#x27;s home near Wilmington, North Carolina. The two discussed and drew up plans for a Committee of Correspondence. The committee&#x27;s purpose: communicate circumstances and revolutionary sentiment among the colonies. It was after this meeting that Quincy dubbed Harnett the &quot;Samuel Adams of North Carolina.&quot;

In December 1773, the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence formed in Wilmington. Although Harnett was absent, he was made chairman of the committee. Other members included John Harvey, Robert Howe, Richard Caswell, Edward Vail, John Ashe, Joseph Hewes, Samuel Johnston, and William Hooper.

===Pennsylvania===

Among the last to form a committee of correspondence, the Province of Pennsylvania did so at a meeting in Philadelphia on May 20, 1774. In a compromise between the more radical and more conservative factions of political activists, the committee was formed by combining the lists each faction proposed. That committee of 19 diversified and grew to 43, then to 66, and finally to two different groups of 100 between May 1774 and its dissolution in September 1776. Ultimately, 160 men from Pennsylvania participated in one or more of the committees, though only four were regularly elected to all of them: Thomas Barclay, John Cox Jr., John Dickinson, and Joseph Reed.

===Virginia===

In early March 1773, Dabney Carr proposed the formation of a permanent Committee of Correspondence before the Virginia House of Burgesses. Virginia&#x27;s own committee was formed on March 12, 1773. Its members were Peyton Randolph, Robert Carter Nicholas, Richard Bland, Richard Henry Lee, Benjamin Harrison, Edmund Pendleton, Patrick Henry, Dudley Digges, Dabney Carr, Archibald Cary, and Thomas Jefferson.

===Other colonies===
By July 1773, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and South Carolina had also formed committees.

With Pennsylvania&#x27;s action in May 1774, all of the colonies that eventually rebelled had established such committees.

The colonial committees successfully organized common resistance to the Tea Act and even recruited physicians who would write that drinking tea would make Americans &quot;weak, effeminate, and for life.&quot;

These permanent committees performed the important planning necessary for the First Continental Congress, which convened in September 1774. The Second Congress created its own committee of correspondence to communicate the American interpretation of events to foreign nations.

These committees were replaced during the revolution with Provincial Congresses.

By 1780, committees of correspondence had also been formed in Great Britain and Ireland.

<text>The Democratic Party of Hawaii (DPH; ) is the affiliate of the Democratic Party in the state of Hawaii.
It is currently the dominant party in the state, and is one of the strongest affiliates of the national Democratic Party. The party currently controls both of Hawaii&#x27;s U.S. House seats, both U.S. Senate seats, the governorship, and has supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, controlling nearly 90% of all legislative seats.

==Organization==
The party is a centralized organization established to promote the party platform as drafted in convention biennially. It is also charged with registering voters and delivering voter turnout through county organizations for Hawaii County, Kauai County, Maui County and the City and County of Honolulu. 

A major factor in the party&#x27;s organization is the ethnicity of Hawaii itself. As Democrats emerged as the dominant political party in 1962, they sought to garner support from Native Hawaiians and other non-whites. This success is attributed to the efforts of portraying themselves as not belonging to the power elite. For decades, the party had little difficulty in winning local and statewide elections, with a significant number of Democrats running unopposed in certain years. The party has also established a gender-equality policy that required the election of more women to the state central committee, resulting in an equal balance of men and women in administrative positions.

State-level organizational meetings are held at the precinct, district, county, and state level, biennially, during even-numbered years. The party adheres to a complex set of bylaws that addresses eligibility for membership, election of officers, holding conventions, and recruiting delegates to represent the party at conventions. A minimum of two delegates are required from each precinct, with an equal number of men and women, as required by its gender-equality policy. While there is no permanent location for state conventions, nearly all of them have been held on the island of Oahu (the most populated) since 1960.

The party is governed by a Chair and the State Central Committee. That committee is composed of representatives from each senatorial district, as well as representatives from each county, for each caucuses and the Young Democrats of Hawaii. Gender equality policies require the State Central Committee to be split equally between male and female representatives.

Due to the extreme geographical distance from the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C., the party is relatively independent in its affairs. As a result, the national party does not typically inquire contributions for fund-raising purposes. Due to the party&#x27;s dominant status in the state, there is some over-representation at national party conventions, in comparison to the population of Hawaii itself. Despite certain advantages, the party remains somewhat isolated on the national level.

==History==


===Founding===
The Democratic Party of Hawaii was formed on April 30, 1900, by supporters of the queen in the wake of a plague quarantine in Honolulu. The meeting brought together five men: John H. Wilson, son of Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson; John S. McGrew, a doctor and supporter of Kalākaua; Charles J. McCarthy, a saloon owner and former Honolulu Rifle; David Kawānanakoa, prince of the House of Kawānanakoa; and Delbert E. Metzger, an engineer from Kaua&#x27;i. The group believed that it was necessary for a party in Hawaii, now a region of the US, to have a national counterpart to survive and established the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The intention of the party was to promote Jeffersonian philosophy and home rule. Following the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy, the Reform Party of Hawaii seized control of government and intended to annex Hawaii to the United States. The reformers became affiliated with the Republican Party for this support of Hawaii&#x27;s annexation in contrast to the Democrats&#x27; opposition. The American Union Party became the regional Republican party in Hawaii, leaving the Democratic Party for any opposition group. The first convention of the Democratic Party of Hawaii was held on May 16 that year and was attended by 500 people. Later that year, Kawānanakoa attended the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City, becoming the first royal attendee. At the convention, Kawānanakoa formed an affiliation between the Democratic Party of Hawaii and the Democratic Party of the United States.

===Elections of 1900===
Leading up to the election of 1900, it became apparent the radically nationalist Home Rule Party became the most popular. Republicans who had been rejected for the unpopular overthrow of the monarchy and promotion of white supremacy, offered a coalition between the Democrats and Republicans. Democrats refused the offer and Home Rule Party came to power. But the election of 1900 was based more on animosity toward the Republican Party for dethroning the monarchy than the Home Rule Party&#x27;s functionality once in power. Due to the extremism of the Home Rule, they were ineffective. Similarly, the Democrats were also consumed with infighting. In the following elections, voters perceived little difference between the internal strife of the Democratic Party and the Home Rule Party. Since the 1900 election, Republicans had formed the Haole-Hawaiian Alliance. This deal with made with former Home Rule members who left the infighting. The Republicans then regained power. In the subsequent years, Democrats supported the stronger Home Rule Party until it dissolved in 1912. The party managed to elect Democrats Joseph J. Fern and Wilson as mayors of Honolulu, along with several other positions, but maintained a weak reputation throughout the territorial years. Among the issues was that offices under leadership positions were frequently held by Republicans, with Democrats achieving leadership positions they only brought limited powers, especially against Republican policies.

===Territory of Hawaii===
After the overthrow of the monarchy and annexation, an oligarchy of powerful sugar corporations called the Big Five effectively controlled government in the Hawaiian Islands, making hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. The oligarchy of Castle &amp; Cooke, Alexander &amp; Baldwin, C. Brewer &amp; Co., Amfac, and Theo H. Davies &amp; Co. worked in favor of the Hawaii Republican Party. The plantations needed labor and the Native Hawaiian population was insufficient to fill the demand. Immigrants from around the world such as Puerto Rico, Korea, and most particularly Japan and the Philippines were brought to Hawaii. In response to the flood of immigrants, Democrats became more nativist. Democrats like McCarthy and Oren Long pushed a compromise of allowing migrant workers that would eventually return to where they came from rather than establish themselves in Hawaii.

===Burns Machine===

Up to the Revolution of 1954, Democrats held a stronger pro-Hawaiian stance, resulting in anti-Asian sentiments based on fears Asian Americans would outperform Hawaiians in education and job performance. Up to World War II, half of elected Democrats were Hawaiian while only a quarter were Caucasian. Following World War II, a local movement to empower laborers in Hawaii was formed. Honolulu Police Department officer John A. Burns began organizing the plantation laborers, especially the Japanese Americans and Filipino Americans he came to know while on his police beats. He began what would be known as the &quot;Burns Machine&quot;. He believed grassroots organizing and the power of elections could overturn the corruption of the Republicans in power. The movement received its biggest boost when Burns successfully influenced Japanese American veterans who fought in World War II to become involved, notably incumbent Daniel Inouye. The coalition was composed of the Democratic Party, Communist Party, 442nd Infantry Regiment, ILWU, and other organizations. During the Burns movement, the party shifted towards egalitarianism, allowing an untapped Japanese voter base to bring them to power. Burns&#x27; efforts culminated in his election to the governorship after attaining statehood, heralding a forty-year era of Democratic rule in Hawai.

===Statehood===
Party standing in the U.S. Congress was strengthened once Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959. For the first time, political representation was fully justified as newly elected representatives were allowed to cast votes. The achievement of statehood had also significantly enhanced the party&#x27;s status within national party organizations. Democrats have held onto a solid majority since 1962, with near-complete control over the state&#x27;s congressional delegation and its legislative and executive branch. At the national level, Democrats held all of Hawaii&#x27;s seats in the Senate and the House. Both positions of governor and lieutenant governor were also filled by Democrats, with the former being held by John Burns, the organizer of the Burns Machine in 1954. Burns was instrumental in the revitalization of the party following World War II. He was reelected two more times and died shortly after his third term in office in 1975.

Factionalism within the party was a problem in the late 1960s, as a newer progressive wing (led by Tom Gill) began to challenge the older wing headed by incumbent governor Burns. This division in the party reached a high point in 1970, when Gill challenged Burns for the next gubernatorial term. As a supporter of environmental protection, consumer protection and other progressive causes, Gill lost the primary election to Burns. While factional struggles continued into the 1970s, the Burns regime remained in power. The strength of the Burns Machine has diminished since the mid-1980s, primarily due to the advanced ages of its original supporters. There has been renewed strength in the progressive wing. Since 1994, progressive supporters have held control over the party central committee, having run unopposed in certain years. The Hawaii Democratic Party maintained political control of the state government in Hawaii for over forty years, from 1962 to 2002. 

The party has remained successful due to its heavy usage of the media, relying on grassroots activities. Campaign tactics and promotion of party ideals have been characterized by rice dinners, rallies, door-to-door campaigning, and sign waving in public areas. These activities have helped maintain the party&#x27;s large membership and its status as the majority party of Hawaii.

==Political positions==

===Liberalism===
The Democratic Party has tended to hold a position on social issues based on how an issue would affects bystanders and/or the environment. The party&#x27;s platform is based on the values of liberty and social justice, with compassion and respect towards the individual. In 1997, the reciprocal beneficiary registration gave recognition to same-sex couples. In 1970 Democratic Governor John A. Burns legalized abortion in Hawaii. But this position has also led to restrictions. In 2006 strict smoking bans were put in place based on the effects of secondhand smoke on bystanders. Since the Revolution of 1954, the Democratic Party of Hawaii has been considered progressive in its center-left ideologies. The party has promoted racial tolerance, multiculturalism, and protection of minorities.

===Trade unionism===
The Democratic Party has asserted itself as Hawaii&#x27;s labor party since gaining support from unions and plantation workers in the 1950s. The party has supported workers rights and collective bargaining. Opposition has come from employers and small business owners who feel their rights have been neglected because of the emphasis on employee protection and rights.

===Economics===
The Democrats prefer increased regulation of big companies because of the relatively small marketplace in Hawaii and past experiences with monopolies and oligopolies, such as the Big Five employer monopoly on the job market. The shipping and airline industries in particular are targeted for regulation. The Democrats tend to be closely involved with the tourism industry. The party believes in the simplification of government processes on the local and state level, with integration of databases to promote efficiency in these areas.

===Environment===
The Democratic Party has favored conservation efforts such as wildlife sanctuaries and reserves. Pollution reduction initiatives have received bipartisan support in Hawaii. The reduction of one&#x27;s carbon footprint is reflected in the party&#x27;s encouragement of using clean energy sources, also with environmentally friendly modes of transportation.

===Healthcare===
The party platform supports a public health care system with development long-term financing solutions for individual care. The party has expressed support towards single payer universal health care coverage with the inclusion of a public option in this plan. The party does not support the denial of coverage towards women for abortion services. Democrats have been involved with healthcare issues and supportive of non-profit healthcare providers. They are also responsible for the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act.

===Religion===
Religion in the Democratic Party varies among individuals. Governor John A. Burns, a devout Roman Catholic, allowed Hawaii to become the first state to legalize abortion. He put his religious views aside when he decided not to veto the bill.

<doc id="1138120" wikidata="Q229272" url="?curid=1138120" title="Ernst Ludwig Kirchner">
<text>Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (6 May 1880 – 15 June 1938) was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or &quot;The Bridge&quot;, a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. His work was branded as &quot;degenerate&quot; by the Nazis in 1933, and in 1937 more than 600 of his works were sold or destroyed.

==Early life and education==
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria. His parents were of Prussian descent and his mother was a descendant of the Huguenots, a fact to which Kirchner often referred. As Kirchner&#x27;s father searched for a job, the family moved frequently and Kirchner attended schools in Frankfurt and Perlen until his father earned the position of Professor of Paper Sciences at the College of technology in Chemnitz, where Kirchner attended secondary school.
==Student in Munich, Dresden==
Although Kirchner&#x27;s parents encouraged his artistic career they also wanted him to complete his formal education so in 1901, he began studying architecture at the Königliche Technische Hochschule of Dresden (now TU Dresden). The institution provided a wide range of studies in addition to architecture, such as freehand drawing, perspective drawing and the historical study of art. While in attendance, he became close friends with Fritz Bleyl, whom Kirchner met during the first term. They discussed art together and also studied nature, having a radical outlook in common. 
Kirchner continued studies in Munich from 1903 to 1904, returning to Dresden in 1905 to complete his degree.
==Die Brücke, 1905-1913==
In 1905, Kirchner, along with Bleyl and two other architecture students, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Erich Heckel, founded the artists group Die Brücke (&quot;The Bridge&quot;). From then on, he committed himself to art. The group aimed to eschew the prevalent traditional academic style and find a new mode of artistic expression, which would form a bridge (hence the name) between the past and the present. They responded both to past artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Matthias Grünewald and
Lucas Cranach the Elder, as well as contemporary international avant-garde movements. As part of the affirmation of their national heritage, they revived older media, particularly woodcut prints. 

Their group was one of the seminal ones which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of Expressionism. The group met initially in Kirchner&#x27;s first studio, which had previously been a butcher&#x27;s shop. Bleyl described it as &quot;that of a real bohemian, full of paintings lying all over the place, drawings, books and artist&#x27;s materials — much more like an artist&#x27;s romantic lodgings than the home of a well-organised architecture student&quot;.

Kirchner&#x27;s studio became a venue which overthrew social conventions to allow casual love-making and frequent nudity. Group life-drawing sessions took place using models from the social circle, rather than professionals, and choosing quarter-hour poses to encourage spontaneity. Bleyl described one such model, Isabella, a fifteen-year-old girl from the neighbourhood, as &quot;a very lively, beautifully built, joyous individual, without any deformation caused by the silly fashion of the corset and completely suitable to our artistic demands, especially in the blossoming condition of her girlish buds.&quot;

A group manifesto written by Kirchner in 1906 stated that &quot;Everyone who reproduces, directly and without illusion, whatever he senses the urge to create, belongs to us&quot;.

In September and October 1906, the first group exhibition was held, focused on the female nude, in the showroom of K.F.M. Seifert and Co. in Dresden.

In 1906, he met Doris Große, who was his favoured model until 1911. Between 1907 and 1911, he stayed during the summer at the Moritzburg lakes and on the island of Fehmarn (which he revisited until 1914) with other Brücke members; his work featured the female nude in natural settings. In 1911, he moved to Berlin, where he founded a private art school, MIUM-Institut, in collaboration with Max Pechstein with the aim of promulgating &quot;Moderner Unterricht im Malen&quot; (modern teaching of painting). This was not a success and closed the following year, when he also began a relationship with Erna Schilling that lasted the rest of his life.

In 1913, his writing of &quot;Chronik der Brücke&quot; (Brücke chronicle) led to the ending of the group. At this time, he established an individual identity with his first solo exhibition, which took place at the Essen Folkwang Museum. During the next two years, he painted a series of &quot;Straßenszenen&quot; (street scenes) showing the streets of Berlin, with the central characters of street walkers.

==Military service and mental breakdown, 1914-1916==

At the onset of the First World War in September 1914, Kirchner volunteered for military service. In July 1915 he was sent to Halle an der Saale to train as a driver in the reserve unit of the 75th Mansfeld Field Artillery Regiment. Kirchner&#x27;s riding instructor, Professor Hans Fehr, arranged for Kirchner to be discharged after a mental breakdown. Kirchner then returned to Berlin and continued to work, producing many paintings including &quot;Self-Portrait as a Soldier&quot; (1915). In December 1915 he was admitted to Dr. Oskar Kohnstamm&#x27;s sanatorium in Königstein (Taunus), where he was diagnosed with alcoholism and addiction to Veronal. 

In a letter to Dr. Karl Hagemann, a friend and patron, Kirchner wrote: &quot;After lengthy struggles I now find myself here for a time to put my mind into some kind of order. It is a terribly difficult thing, of course, to be among strangers so much of the day. But perhaps I&#x27;ll be able to see and create something new. For the time being, I would like more peace and absolute seclusion. Of course, I long more and more for my work and my studio. Theories may be all very well for keeping a spiritual balance, but they are grey and shadowy compared with work and life&quot;. Throughout 1916, Kirchner periodically returned to Berlin for a few weeks at a time to continue his work at his studio; he also produced a series of oil paintings, and many drawings, during his stays in Königstein. After an exhibition of his work at the gallery of Ludwig Schames, in Frankfurt am Main, in October 1916, Kirchner sold many works and began to do well financially. In December, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Dr. Edel&#x27;s sanatorium in Berlin-Charlottenburg.

==Davos, 1917-1938==
In 1917, at the suggestion of , Helene Spengler invited Kirchner to Davos. He arrived on January 19, 1917. There he visited an exhibition of Ferdinand Hodler&#x27;s paintings. His visit to Davos coincided with a spell of exceptionally cold weather and he returned to Berlin after only ten days.

Grisebach visited him in March 1917, writing to Helene Spengler of Kirchner&#x27;s condition: &quot;I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only with the help of a stick was he able to walk, staggering around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh&#x27;s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting&quot;.

In April 1917, Kirchner&#x27;s close friend and mentor Botho Graef died and Kirchner decided to return to Davos for treatment. There he was under the care of Dr. Lucius Spengler who forced Kirchner to adhere to strict rules and routine. Kirchner deeply resented this and did everything in his power to deceive the doctor: &quot;Spengler didn&#x27;t know what to do with me, for my deception was totally alien to this excellent man&#x27;s way of thinking&quot;. To avoid being under constant watch, Kirchner moved to the Reusch Hut on the Stafelalp in the summer of 1917. Kirchner continued to experience depression, occasional pain and paralysis of his limbs but wrote in a more cheerful tone to Dr. Hagemann at the end of July: &quot;I wish to remain in the world and for the world. The high mountains here will help me&quot;. The summer 1917 was very productive despite Kirchner&#x27;s illness. He finished some important pieces during the two months, such as &quot;View of the Church in Monstein&quot; and &quot;Rising Moon in the Stafelalp&quot;. Together with 11 woodcuts, these works marked the start of Kirchner&#x27;s Alpine life.

Kirchner was then admitted to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where he continued to produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to &quot;In den Lärchen&quot; in Frauenkirch Davos, where he rented a room on the first floor and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: &quot;I&#x27;m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt&#x27;s studio&quot;. Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also wrote &quot;A Painter&#x27;s Credo&quot; where he states: &quot;There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man... This is the last judgement, before them you stand... They help you when you work. You can thank them only through work. When you want to die, they sometimes appear to you. When you are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them&quot;. Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner&#x27;s business there.

Kirchner continued to work through 1919 and 1920 as his health also rapidly improved.
His reputation grew with several exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland in 1920. He was provided with many subjects to paint as he came to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner&#x27;s gramophone. Kirchner wrote of the people of Davos: &quot;The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man&#x27;s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed to be here, and through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me&quot;. Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.

In 1921, there was a major display of Kirchner&#x27;s work in Berlin and the reviews were favourable. Kirchner&#x27;s father died on 14 February. Kirchner visited Zurich at the beginning of May and met the dancer, Nina Hard, whom he invited back to Frauenkirch despite Erna&#x27;s objections. Nina Hard would become an important model for Kirchner and would be featured in many of his works. Kirchner began creating designs for carpets which were then woven by Lise Gujer.

In 1923, Kirchner moved to the Wildboden house, writing in his diary: &quot;Our new little house is a real joy to us. We shall live here comfortably and in great new order. This will really come to be a turning point of my life. Everything must be put in clear order and the little house furnished as simply and modestly as possible, while still being beautiful and intimate&quot;. The house looked over Frauenkirch and the Stafelalp on one side and on the other, Davos and Kirchner used these landscapes as subjects for many of his paintings.
In 1925, Kirchner became close friends with fellow artist, Albert Müller and his family. Rot-Blau, a new art group based in Basel, was formed by Hermann Scherer, Albert Müller, Paul Camenisch and Hans Schiess, who all visited Kirchner and worked under his guidance. At the end of 1925, Kirchner returned to Germany and made his rounds to Frankfurt, Chemnitz, where his mother was living, and Berlin where he met with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff who wanted Kirchner to form a new artist&#x27;s group, but Kirchner politely refused. He then returned to Frauenkirch and wrote to Dr. Hageman on 26 March 1926: &quot;Now I&#x27;m sitting quietly at home again and I&#x27;m happy to be able to work undisturbed. I made a lot of sketches of life in Germany and it was very intriguing to see life there. I was also glad to see the old pictures of Rembrandt, Dürer, etc. again and to have the confirmation and encouragement they gave me. As for the moderns, I saw damned little that gripped me&quot;. In December 1926, Kirchner&#x27;s close friend, Albert Müller, died of typhoid fever along with his wife, Anni Müller. In 1927, Kirchner organized a memorial exhibition for Albert Müller at the Kunsthalle Basel. There was a major exhibition of Kirchner&#x27;s work at the schoolhouse in Davos with positive reviews.

Kirchner continued to work in Frauenkirch, his style growing increasingly abstract. In 1929, 
Kirchner was forced to distance himself from Rot-Blau after they pledged allegiance to him, which upset Kirchner greatly. He addressed them in &quot;An open letter to the Basel Red-Blue group&quot; in No. 5 of &quot;Das Kunstbaltt&quot;, where stated that he was not their patron. In the same year, Kirchner visited Zurich, Berlin, and Essen. He was also visited in Frauenkirch by the painter Fritz Winter.

In 1930, Kirchner began to experience health problems due to smoking and in 1931 Erna had to undergo surgery in Berlin due to a suspected growth. In 1931, he was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. As the Nazi party took power in Germany in 1933, it became impossible for Kirchner to sell his paintings. In 1937, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: &quot;Here we have been hearing terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it&#x27;s all surely untrue. I&#x27;m a little tired and sad about the situation up there. There is a war in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Brücke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany. And now it is supposed to be un-German. Dear God. It does upset me&quot;.

In 1934, Kirchner visited Berne and Zurich, finding the former more pleasing than the latter, and met Paul Klee. In the winter of 1935, a new school was being planned to be built in Frauenkirch. Kirchner offered to paint a mural, but the project was dropped and Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse instead . Reflecting on the inauguration of the schoolhouse in 1936 he writes, &quot;the new school was inaugurated yesterday. It was a celebration with songs, dancing and speeches, followed by drinking such as I have not seen or experienced in decades...They made a point of including me and so there I was, sitting once again amongst these people who had received me with such kindness and friendliness on the alp twenty years ago. The relief has found favour and was mentioned often in the speeches&quot;.

Throughout 1936 and 1937, Kirchner began to experience health problems and was prescribed Ovaltine and Eukodal by his doctors. In 1937, the Degenerate Art Exhibition took place in Germany; a total of 639 works by Kirchner were taken out of museums and 25 were displayed in the exhibition. The Academy of Arts in Berlin expelled Kirchner as a member. Kirchner continued to work and organised a major exhibit in Basel, which received mixed reviews.

==Death== 
Throughout 1938, Kirchner became increasingly upset with the situation in Germany. After Austria was annexed by Germany in the Anschluss, Kirchner became disturbed by the idea that Germany might invade Switzerland. On 15 June 1938, Kirchner took his own life by gunshot in front of his home in Frauenkirch; however, there are doubts about his death being a suicide. Three days later, Kirchner was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof cemetery. Erna continued to live in the house until her death in 1945.

==Legacy==
In 1913, the first public showing in the United States of Kirchner&#x27;s work took place at the Armory Show, which was also the first major display of modern art in America. In 1921, U.S. museums began to acquire his work and did so increasingly thereafter. His first solo museum show in the US was at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1937. In 1969, a major retrospective of paintings, drawings, and prints traveled to the Seattle Art Museum, the Pasadena Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1992, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, held a monographic show, using its existing collection; a major international loan exhibition took place in 2003. In November 2006 at Christie&#x27;s, Kirchner&#x27;s Street Scene, &quot;Berlin&quot; (1913) fetched $38 million, a record for the artist. From 3 August to 10 November 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a major exhibition that &quot;probably comprises the very best of his oeuvre.&quot;

Many of Kirchner&#x27;s collectors were Jewish and persecuted by the Nazis for that reason. They either sold off their collections in order to flee the Nazis or had their collections seized. The Kirchner paintings &quot;&quot;Berlin Street Scene&quot; and &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot;&quot; were owned by the Jewish art collector Alfred Hess whose widow was forced to relinquish them before fleeing. Kirchner&#x27;s 1915 painting &quot;Artillerymen&quot; was owned by the important art dealer of modern art, the German Jewish Alfred Flechtheim whose art gallery was Aryanized (seized by Nazis) in 1933 before he fled Germany. Kirchner&#x27;s painting &quot;Sand Hills in Engadine,&quot; which had been seized by the Nazis in 1935 after its owner, Max Fischer, fled Germany for the United States, found its way into the collection of the MoMA, but was returned to Fischer&#x27;s heirs in 2015.

<doc id="1138121" wikidata="Q2668523" url="?curid=1138121" title="5 Colours in Her Hair">
<text>&quot;5 Colours in Her Hair&quot; is the debut single by English pop rock band McFly. It was also the band&#x27;s first UK number one. It stayed at the top for two weeks. The song was written by Tom Fletcher, James Bourne, Danny Jones and Ben Sargeant. The track is especially well known for its &quot;Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!&quot; lyrics, played at the beginning and at the ending of the song. The CD and 7-inch formats features a duet with Busted singing a cover of the Kinks song &quot;Lola&quot;.

Overall, it spent twelve weeks in the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number seven in Ireland. The song was inspired by Susan Lee, a character played by actress Emily Corrie in the TV series &quot;As If&quot;, who wore coloured dreadlocks. The music itself is indebted to 1960s surf and beat music. The song was also nominated for The Record of the Year in 2004, but finished in second place just one point behind the winner, &quot;Thunderbirds / 3AM&quot; by Busted.

==Music video==
McFly shot the video for their debut single &quot;5 Colours in Her Hair&quot; just after Christmas 2003. Simon Amstell recorded an interview and footage behind the scenes for Channel 4 music show, &quot;Popworld&quot;. The video begins by introducing the band members in a comical style, by getting Danny and Dougie&#x27;s names wrong. It also features the band messing around at various different scenes, but telling the overall main story about a girl with 5 colours in her hair, who was miserable and living in a black and white world. She then follows them into the TV where she joins the band in a club setting where the band are playing to a crowd. They also shoot various well known scenes as a tribute to their main influences including the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The video was shot in front of a green screen. It stars Molly Portsmouth as the &#x27;Girl with 5 Colours in Her Hair&#x27;.

==US version==
A rerecorded pop punk version of the song appeared on the &quot;Just My Luck&quot; album, McFly&#x27;s debut album in the US. It also features minor lyrical alterations. The song was included on the &quot;Please, Please&quot; single release in the UK, as well as on the &quot;All the Greatest Hits&quot; deluxe fan edition. It would go on to be the default way they would perform the song live.

<doc id="1138124" wikidata="Q329471" url="?curid=1138124" title="FC Baník Ostrava">
<text>FC Baník Ostrava is a professional football club from Ostrava in the Czech Republic. The club competes in the Czech First League, the top tier of Czech football.

Founded in 1922 as SK Slezská Ostrava, Baník has won the Czech First League once, as well as the Czechoslovak First League three times. Internationally the club won the Mitropa Cup in 1988 and the Mitropa Super Cup the following year.

== History ==

=== Formation and history to 1937 ===

The club was founded on 8 September 1922 as &quot;SK Slezská Ostrava&quot;, when 20 activists signed the establishment treaty in the &quot;U Dubu&quot; restaurant. The signatories were mostly poor coal miners from the Kamenec coal mining settlement in Ostrava. The founders were Karel Aniol, Arnošt Haberkiewicz, Petr Křižák, František Mruzek and Jaroslav Horák.

SK Slezská Ostrava was a poor club; raising money for the functioning of the club was a common concern. They didn&#x27;t have their own playing field and were forced to loan fields from wealthier clubs. The first field of its own was built in autumn of 1925 at Kamenec. It was however stony and did not meet requirements of the football officials. In 1934 club activists succeeded in renting the land at &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; from regional wealthy industrialist Count Wilczek. During the summer of 1934 a new field was built there. Many workers volunteered to help with the construction for free. Workers and coal miners often came directly from shifts to build the field.

SK Slezská Ostrava began to compete with other teams in the league system in the spring of 1923. They started in the lowest division &quot;(III. třída župy)&quot; and were promoted to the higher division the same year. It took, however, some time for the club to reach the highest divisions of football in Czechoslovakia. In 1934 the club won promotion to the Moravian-Silesian Division, one of the highest leagues in the country. The promotion made SK Slezská Ostrava a popular team in the city and public interest was rising. The 1935 derby against Slovan Ostrava at &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; was watched by 5,400 spectators.

=== From 1937 to 1952 ===
The Czechoslovak First League was dominated by Prague teams at that time, which were advanced in all aspects. Promotion to the First League was, therefore, a big success for SK Slezská Ostrava. In 15 years the team advanced from being obscure minnows to the highest level of football in the country. The first league match at &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; was played on 22 August 1937 against 1. ČsŠK Bratislava. In the second match, the newcomer team faced famous Sparta Prague in Prague. Though Sparta&#x27;s roster was full of national team players, Baník won 3–2 and caused an immediate sensation. SK Slezská Ostrava survived three seasons in the First League before being relegated in 1940.

SK Slezská Ostrava played at a lower level until 1943, when they were again promoted to the First League. Promotion to the highest league sparked even stronger interest for football in local people. Later, famed opera singer Rudolf Asmus even sang a new anthem for the club. In the 1943–44 season the home attendances of SK Slezská Ostrava reached the highest level so far. The match against Slavia Prague was attended by 33,000 people.

=== From 1952 to 1967 ===
In 1952 the club adopted the name &quot;DSO Baník Ostrava&quot;. Since then the name went only through slight changes. In the 1954 season, Baník achieved their biggest league success so far, finishing second in the league behind Sparta. In 1959 Baník played for the last time at the old &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; stadium. &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; did not meet the requirements set by the football association. The pitch was not grassy, but covered with slag, which was also a reason to close down the stadium. Bazaly stadium was constructed in 1959 in Slezská Ostrava, and was opened on 19 April that year.

In the 1965–66 season Baník were weakened by the generation change. They finished 13th in the league table and were relegated to the Second League. After winning the Second League in 1966–67, Baník were promoted back to the top division.

=== The Golden Era ===
In 1972–73 and 1977–78 Baník won the Czechoslovak Cup. In the 1975-76 season, the club won the Czechoslovak First League for the first time.

The team&#x27;s squad was stable in the Golden Era years. The best players like Verner Lička and Rostislav Vojáček were regularly playing for the national team. Others like Libor Radimec, Zdeněk Rygel, Petr Němec and Zdeněk Šreiner played for the Olympic team. In the 1979–80 season Baník won their second Czechoslovak title, finishing five points ahead of Zbrojovka Brno. In the 1980–81 season of the UEFA European Cup Baník reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by Bayern Munich. In the same season&#x27;s league, Baník won the First League for the third time. For the next two seasons, Baník finished second in the league table. After the 1982–83 season, coach Hadamczik resigned, thus symbolically ending the Golden Era of the club.

=== From 1983 ===
In the following years, Baník was unable to reach the highest positions in the league. The team was undergoing another generation change and young players did not maintain their performance for the whole season. Baník however regularly appeared in the upper part of the league table. In the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons they finished second in the league. In 1991, Baník won the Czechoslovak Cup by beating Spartak Trnava 6–1 in the final.

In the 2003–04 season they won the Czech Republic league.

=== From 2016: the Václav Brabec era ===
In the 2015–16 season they were under financial distress and were bought by Czech millionaire Václav Brabec who originated from Kroměříž. They were relegated to the Czech Second League for the 2016–17 season. In the 2016–17 season they finished 2nd and started their rebuild to compete in the Czech First League for the 2017–18 season.

With no youth training facilities before the new ownership, under Václav Brabec the team began investing 150 million Kč in three facilities.

1) A partnership in 2017 with K-9 Grade School of J. Šoupal, where they have at their disposal 2 natural fields and 1 artificial field for the youth development.

2) building (&quot;expected complete early 2019&quot;) new training grounds at Vista that will enable the team to have 2 more artificial fields and 1 natural field for their youth teams.

3) The team is working with the Dvořák High School that will enable their athletes to finish a degree in sports management as well as all 20–25 individuals to train together.

Václav Brabec hired former Baník Ostrava star and home-grown player Marek Jankulovski to take over the role of Dušan Vrťo as the team&#x27;s Sport Director. Jankulovski brought in a few players such as Daniel Holzer, Patrizio Stronati and Adam Jánoš for the 2018–19 season.

In the 2020–21 season Marek Jankulovski stepped down from his role to take the Chairman Board of Directors role. Milan Baroš retired. Acquisitions before the 2020–21 campaign came from FC Slovácko in Jan Juroška and Tomáš Zajíc. Puma became the new team kit provider, taking over from existing kit manufacturer Adidas.

==Stadiums==
In the early beginings from 1922 to 1925, the club was without its own ground or stadium. The first ground was completed in Ostrava&#x27;s miner district &quot;Kamenec&quot; in 1925. Banik was playing there for 9 years and moved to southern part of Silesian Ostrava near by a park &quot;Stará střelnice&quot; (Old Shooting range). It was a special place, because a cable car with coal was running above one of the wooden stands. That was also one of the reasons why the stadium started to fail league criteria in the early 1950s.

The club management was looking for a new place for the new stadium and found it in the area of former basalt quarry. They then started building a new stadium for more than 30,000 spectators and named it Bazaly after the basalt. It was Banik&#x27;s home from 1959 to 2015 and later had a capacity of approximately 17,500 seats. Currently, Bazaly is being transformed into a youth academy that will have 5 training fields.

In 2015 the club moved to Ostrava&#x27;s Městský stadion, which has a capacity of 15,275.

==Supporters==
In the late 2000s Baník had attendances higher than most within the Czech First League.

Ultra supporters of Baník call themselves &quot;Chachaři&quot;, which means &quot;bad boys&quot; in the local dialect. Some of the ultras&#x27; songs contain lyrics proudly demonstrating willingness to not only sing, but also fight for their club. Baník&#x27;s ultras have made friendships over the years, and in 2006 celebrated 10 years of partnership with 2nd division Poland club, GKS Katowice. The celebration took the form of a game between the two teams, organised by the clubs&#x27; directors. The fixture took place at GKS&#x27;s stadium, where throughout the 90 minutes the opposing sets of fans sung one another&#x27;s songs. At the end of the game, both sets of fans climbed over metal fences in order to race onto the pitch come the final whistle to embrace and exchange scarves.

<text>Salthouse Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Canning Dock to the north, Wapping Dock via Wapping Basin to the south and Albert Dock to the west.

==History==
Designed by Thomas Steers and being built from 1734, Salthouse Dock was completed after his death by Henry Berry, opening in 1753. The dock was originally known as South Dock, the name changing because it was nearby to John Blackburne&#x27;s saltworks. As is indicative of its name, the dock was an important transit terminal for the salt industry. Liverpool was a base for the refining of rock salt from Cheshire and its onward transportation. The dock also handled agricultural produce from Ireland and the Mediterranean. Around 1769, John Okill had a shipyard on the south side.
Structural improvements were made to the dock basin in 1842 and 1855. The opening of the Albert Dock in 1846 allowed vessels to be unloaded there, before moving on to the Salthouse Dock for loading. By the mid-19th century, the main trade from the dock was with China and the East Indies. The dock served square rigged sailing ships until about 1914. 

Custom House railway station, on the Liverpool Overhead Railway, was opened at the north-east corner of the dock in 1893. The station, opened at the same time as the railway, was renamed &quot;Canning&quot; in 1947 and closed in 1956 along with the railway. By 1920, the Wapping and Salthouse Goods Depot of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was on the eastern side of the dock.

A Royal Navy training ship, HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, was based at Salthouse Dock from the end of the 19th century. This was originally a wooden vessel, which was renamed HMS &quot;Eaglet&quot; in 1918 and replaced in 1927. The following vessel survived until 1972. In 1934, the dock had warehousing along all four quays. The dock closed in 1972.

===After closure===
After the closure of Salthouse Dock, the dock silted up during the following decade and the quayside was in a state of considerable dereliction by 1980. At this point, transit sheds still remained on the east and west sides of the dock, with a former lifeboat training school also present at the north end of the western quay. In 1981, the Merseyside Development Corporation was established to rejuvenate the South Docks, and the dock was dredged between 1981-5. During the 1980s, direct access from Canning Dock was removed with the entrance being filled in, and a permanent roadway and slipway installed. Swing bridges, which were across the Albert Dock and Wapping Basin entrances, were also replaced with fixed structures.

By 2005, the dock had gained a significant marine biodiversity, including jellyfish, mussels, sponges and seaweed. Non-native marine wildlife found in the vicinity included giant snails, Korean sea squirts and Australasian barnacles.

Until 2013, Yellow Duckmarines were used in the dock as a tourist attraction. On 30 March and 15 June 2013, one of their four amphibious vehicles sank in the dock, which resulted in the withdrawal of licensing for the vehicles. In 2024, Splash Tours Liverpool opened, reintroducing amphibious tours to the dock. 

==Present==

Salthouse Dock is the oldest existing dock in Liverpool, and some of the masonry in the south-west corner of the dock is from the original construction. The dock walls are Grade II listed. A granite stone gable and arch entrance survives at the south east corner of the dock, from a transit shed built by Jesse Hartley.

Following the completion of the Liverpool Canal Link in 2009, Salthouse Dock is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to Liverpool Marina at Brunswick and Coburg Docks. The waterspace of this and the other docks in the southern system was owned by British Waterways from 2003 to 2012, now transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust. Salthouse Dock has pontoon moorings for small watercraft.

<doc id="1138129" wikidata="Q539363" url="?curid=1138129" title="Fyodor Alekseyev">
<text>Fyodor Yakovlevich Alekseyev (Russian: Фёдор Яковлевич Алексеев; c.1753–1755 – 23 November 1824) was a Russian painter. His contemporaries often called him the Russian Canaletto, in recognition of his masterful vedute.

== Biography==
He was the son of the caretaker at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he was admitted in 1764 upon a petition by his father, after studying for several years at the garrison school. In 1767, he took a class in ornamental sculpture and later studied scenic painting with Antonio Peresinotti. From 1773 to 1777, he lived in Venice on a fellowship, where he studied to be a theater artist. This did not appeal to him, however, and he spent much of his time painting landscapes and copying the old masters.

Having incurred the displeasure of the authorities at the Academy, when he returned he was put to work as a decorator for the Imperial Theatres until 1786 and was not allowed to continue his academic studies. Undaunted, he continued to paint what he pleased and slowly won some recognition. In 1794, his &quot;View of the Palace Embankment from the Fortress&quot; earned him the title of Academician.

In 1800, Tsar Paul I assigned him to create vedute of the streets and architecture in Moscow. From 1803, he taught at the Academy, but also travelled extensively, visiting Kherson, Mykolaiv, Bakhchysarai, Oryol and other locations in the south which had been visited by Catherine the Great, where he produced plein air sketches and watercolors of the surrounding areas. In 1810, he produced a series of works depicting Saint Petersburg.

In his later years, his fame steadily declined and he died in poverty, leaving a large family behind. The Academy paid his funeral expenses.

<doc id="1138132" wikidata="Q336617" url="?curid=1138132" title="Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun">
<text>Flora Marjorie Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun (18 October 1930 – 3 September 2024), was a Scottish noblewoman and Crossbench peer. Until her retirement on 12 December 2014, she was the only holder of a lordship of Parliament with a seat in the House of Lords as an elected hereditary peer.

==Early life==
Saltoun was born in Edinburgh on 18 October 1930, the daughter of Alexander, Master of Saltoun (later 20th Lord Saltoun), and Dorothy Geraldine Welby (1890–1985). Her maternal grandfather was Sir Charles Welby, 5th Baronet, Conservative MP for Newark. She was raised at Cairnbulg Castle near Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, which her father had purchased in 1934 after it had been sold by Frasers in 1613. She was educated at Heathfield School, Ascot, and St Mary&#x27;s School, Wantage. She had an elder brother, Alexander Simon Fraser, Master of Saltoun (1921–1944), who was their father&#x27;s heir apparent. He was killed in action in March 1944 while serving with the Grenadier Guards during World War II, making Flora heir presumptive.

==Career==
In 1979, Flora succeeded her father as 21st Lady Saltoun. She took her seat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. On 1 May 1984, a decree by the Court of the Lord Lyon, declared that Saltoun was the Chief of the Name and Arms of Clan Fraser and head of the Scottish lowland family, the Frasers of Philorth.

As chief, she was heavily involved in clan activities, seeing herself as its &quot;matriarch&quot; She published a family history in 1997, maintained an extensive clan website and designed tartans. In 1997, she, with Lord Lovat, hosted a four day Fraser gathering, attended by 30,000 people.

In the Lords, she sat on the ecclesiastical and procedure committees and spoke on policies such as the Common Fisheries Policy and same-sex marriage. She was a proponent of decorum in the house and was opposed to the removal of hereditary peers. For 25 years, she served as secretary of the Association of Scottish Peers.

In 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed 662 hereditary peers, Saltoun was one of the ninety hereditary peers elected to remain in the Lords. On 12 December 2014, she retired from the Lords under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.

==Personal life==
Flora Fraser met Alexander Ramsay of Mar (1919–2000), son of the former Princess Patricia of Connaught, at the Perth Hunt Ball. They became engaged and Queen Elizabeth II gave her official consent to the marriage under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 on 19 August 1956.

They were married on 6 October 1956 at St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Fraserburgh. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Queen Ingrid of Denmark (her husband&#x27;s first cousin) attended. As her father&#x27;s heir, she kept her maiden surname after marriage. The couple had three daughters:
* Katherine Ingrid Mary Isabel Fraser, 22nd Lady Saltoun (born 11 October 1957); married Mark Nicolson on 3 May 1980 and had issue.
* The Hon. Alice Elizabeth Margaret Ramsay of Mar (born 8 July 1961); goddaughter of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, married David Ramsey on 28 July 1990 and had issue.
* The Hon. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Ramsay of Mar (born 15 April 1963)

As Ramsay&#x27;s wife, she was considered a member of the extended British royal family. They frequently attended garden parties at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and other major royal occasions. Her husband was also closely related to the Swedish and Danish royal families, and they attended the weddings of the future Queen Margrethe II in 1967 and King Carl XVI Gustaf in 1976. After being widowed, the last major occasion she attended in Britain was the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011.

The couple inherited Mar Lodge near Braemar from his aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught. They also resided at Cairnbulg Castle and Inverey House, a mock baronial house they built near Ballater.

Saltoun died at home in Ballater on 3 September 2024, at the age of 93. A memorial service was held on 25 November 2024 at St Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Fraserburgh.

<doc id="1138133" wikidata="Q5466669" url="?curid=1138133" title="For Ann (rising)">
<text>For Ann (rising) is a piece of electronic music composed by American composer and music theorist James Tenney in 1969. The piece incorporates the Shepard tone concept, named after Tenney&#x27;s colleague at Bell Labs, psychologist Roger Shepard. The technique which the piece uses is more properly described as a continuous Risset scale, or a Shepard-Risset glissando .

It consists of a repeating sequence of sine waves arranged in a glissando between twelve and fifteen rising at any time and fading in and out, entering a minor sixth below their predecessors (; ). The concept of the piece derived from Tenney&#x27;s speculations on auditory illusions in his 1961 master&#x27;s thesis &quot;Meta (+) Hodos&quot;, an early application of gestalt theory and cognitive science to music.

==Variations==
Imagining an inverted version of &quot;For Ann (rising)&quot;, American composer Philip Corner once remarked that the piece &quot;must be optimistic! (Imagine the depressing effectiveness of it—he could never be so cruel—downward)...&quot; .

Tenney suggested in later years that the piece could be &quot;regenerated&quot; with the distance between successive voices, the minor sixth (1.6 in just intonation, 1.587 in equal temperament), being tuned to golden ratio phi (1.618). He noted that this would aurally achieve a more illusory effect, because then all first-order difference tones between adjacent voices would be present in lower voices .

<doc id="1138135" wikidata="Q5470727" url="?curid=1138135" title="Fort Ancient (Lebanon, Ohio)">
<text>Fort Ancient (33 WA 2) is a Native American earthworks complex located in Washington Township, Warren County, Ohio, along the eastern shore of the Little Miami River about seven miles (11 km) southeast of Lebanon on State Route 350. The site is the largest prehistoric hilltop enclosure in the United States with three and one-half miles (18,000 ft) of walls in a complex. Built by the Hopewell culture, who lived in the area from the 200 BC to AD 400, the site is situated on a wooded bluff above the Little Miami. It is the namesake of a culture known as Fort Ancient who lived near the complex long after it was constructed.

Maintained as a state historical park, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark for its significance. The State of Ohio purchased the land and made it Ohio&#x27;s first state park in 1891. In addition, this is part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, one of 14 sites nominated in January 2008 by the U.S. Department of the Interior for potential submission by the United States to the UNESCO World Heritage List. It was officially designated a World Heritage Site in September 2023 together with the earthworks at Hopewell Culture National Historical Park and the Newark Earthworks.

==Construction==
The Fort Ancient earthworks were built in at least three stages over an estimated 400-year period. The shoulder blades of deer, split elk antlers, clam shell hoes, and digging sticks were used to loosen the dirt, and baskets holding 35 to 40 pounds were used to carry and distribute the soils in building the earthworks. Archaeologists estimate the total volume of earth in the walls at .

== Archaeological Research ==
In 1809 the Philadelphia Port Folio published the first map and description of Fort Ancient. The accounts of the site by Atwater and Warden several years later are nearly identical to the 1809 report and map. The site was visited and surveyed in by John Locke in 1843. In Edwin Hamilton Davis and Ephraim George Squier&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot;, they described Fort Ancient as &quot;one of the most extensive, if not the most extensive, work...in the entire West&quot;, regarding its size.
Warren K. Moorehead conducted some of the initial excavations at Fort Ancient in 1887 and published his research in 1891 in the book &quot;Fort Ancient: Great Prehistoric Warren County Ohio&quot;. Additional research was conducted by William C. Mills in 1908 and Richard Morgan and Holmes Ellis in 1939–1940.

More contemporary research includes the following:

* From 1982 until her untimely death in 1991, Patricia Essenpreis conducted a series of excavations that included the re-excavation and examination of embankment wall cuts conducted by Richard Morgan. These excavations demonstrated that the embankment walls were built in multiple stages and that post structures were documented at the base of the walls. She also examined the Gateway 13 exterior spur where she found evidence of bladelet manufacturing. Her final project involved the excavation of a pavement and structure on the exterior of the earthworks near the Twin Mound complex. Here, she documented a three-level limestone pavement with household or domestic activity at the lowest level.
* From 1987 through 2006, Robert Connolly collaborated with and then continued the research projects initiated by Patricia Essenpreis. His initial work involved taking Essenpreis&#x27;s &quot;canons of construction&quot; to develop an &quot;architectural grammar&quot; of earthwork elements, demonstrating their intentional and precise placement throughout the Fort Ancient complex. In 1995 and 1996 Connolly directed the investigation of embankment walls and a large interior space of the North Fort of the earthwork in advance of a new museum construction. The embankment wall excavation confirmed Essenpreis&#x27; conclusion of multiple construction levels, but added a level of complexity in alternate basket loads of different soils in the construction, many features below the embankment wall, and a three-level limestone pavement on the exterior of the wall that contained a cache of burnt animal bones. Excavation in the North Fort interior space revealed the presence of 10 habitation structures.
* Beginning in 2006, Robert Riordan conducted excavations in the North Fort of the earthwork complex that revealed a complex series of posts and activity areas, some with intense burning. Riordan named the Moorehead Circle after the archaeologist who conducted early excavations at the site.

==Purpose==

Some archaeologists originally thought the site was created to provide shelter against enemies. However, that interpretation is now discounted as the site presents anomalies inconsistent with defensive use such as:
* Ditches are located inside the walls, rather than outside as a means of defense.
* The 84 gateway openings in the walls could not have been defended in case of attack.
* Evidence has not been found for the number of occupants necessary for a significant defense force.

Based on the total corpus of archaeological research, the current functional interpretation is that the walls were designed for social, economic, political and ceremonial purposes. Research demonstrates the site architecture was aligned with significant astronomical events. In the Northeast corner of the complex, four circular stone-covered mounds are arranged in a square. The southwest mound of the four is interpreted to have functioned as a point that aligned with gateway openings in the embankment walls to mark significant solar and lunar events.

==Museum==
The site now includes a museum covering 1500 years of American Indian heritage in the Ohio Valley. Topics include North America&#x27;s earliest people, the development of agriculture, and the impact of Europeans who migrated to the area and came into conflict with the Native Americans then living in region. The Museum also contains a classroom, a research area, and a gift shop. The site is open to the public Wednesday-Saturday from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM and Sunday 12:00 - 5:00 PM ..

==The Historic Era Fort Ancient Village==
In the 1800s to early 1900s a village existed on the eastern bank of the Little Miami River, at the base of the Fort Ancient Earthworks. The village once had a post office (1846), hotel, blacksmith shop and other businesses and residences. The village no longer exists, but is currently the home of a canoe livery and a private campground.

In the 19th century, Fort Ancient was a stop on the Little Miami Railroad. A historic tavern called the Cross Keys Tavern remains on the west bank of the Little Miami River and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area is currently a public access to the Little Miami Bike Trail, which occupies the former railway land that follows the River. There is a public access and parking for the Little Miami River at the site.

<doc id="1138140" wikidata="Q448768" url="?curid=1138140" title="Alveolar hydatid disease">
<text>Alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) is a form of echinococcosis, or a disease that originates from a parasitic flatworm. AHD is caused by an infection of the flatworm species &quot;Echinococcus multilocularis&quot;. Although alveolar echinococcosis is rarely diagnosed in humans and is not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis (caused by &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot;), it is also still a serious disease that has a significantly high fatality rate. It is considered one of the most life-threatening helminthic infections humans can have.

It is most prevalent in China, Eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, and Russia, and is mostly confined to the Northern hemisphere, south to around the 40th or 45th degree of Northern latitude, save some cases reported in Northern Africa.

== Signs and symptoms ==
As the larvae grow in the liver, they create lesions. If untreated, this progresses into abdominal mass and/or pain, jaundice, and finally liver failure.

== Cause ==
AHD is caused by the larval stage of &quot;E. mulitilocularis&quot;, a species of flatworm found in the Northern Hemisphere. Humans make poor intermediate hosts for the worm, as they play no role in their life cycle. However, when exposed the worms will still infect them. A major risk factor is when their domesticated dogs and cats eat wild, infected (typically arvicolid) rodents. Their feces then will contain the worms&#x27; eggs, which have fully developed larval worms inside. Humans become infected after eating food or water contaminated by embryonated eggs, or by handling an infected host like dogs and cats or by skinning infected foxes.

== Pathophysiology ==
Once ingested by humans, &quot;the oncospheres hatch in the stomach or small intestine, become activated, penetrate the epithelial layer, and migrate via blood and lymphatic vessels to the visceral organs, primarily the liver, where they develop to another larval stage, the metacestode.&quot; The larval growth resembles a slow-moving liver tumor and it is able to destroy both the liver parenchyma and its function.

== Diagnosis ==
Due to its infiltration into biliary and vascular liver tissue, it can be difficult to differentiate AHD and liver cancer.

== Management ==
Early detection and treatment and radical surgery is key to preventing fatality from AHD. Treatment may include liver resection to remove the larvae and chemotherapy using benzimidazoles. Chemotherapy must continue for many years, sometimes for the remainder of the patient&#x27;s life. Failure to comply with these expensive and difficult treatments will likely result in death for the patient.

== Prognosis ==
The disease is often progressive and destructive. The growth happens slow, and so many people do not get symptoms until the later stages. Central necrotic cavities are common in advanced stages of the disease.

== Epidemiology ==
AHD is not as common as diseases caused by other flatworms, but it is still prevalent in the Northern hemisphere. It is not uncommon in China, with some communities having a 5% or more infection rate. In Europe, it is considered an emerging disease. The increasing fox populations of Europe correlate with heightened reported cases.

== History ==
In 1855, Rudolf Virchow, the German pathologist, recognized that the disorder that was at the time known as &quot;colloid carcinoma of the liver&quot;, which was known for its tumor-like lesions in the liver, were actually caused by an &quot;Echinococcus&quot; species. For 100 year it was debated whether the species was &quot;E. granulosus&quot; or a different species. It was finally settled by two publications between 1954 and 1955, the former from Alaska and the latter from Germany.

== Society and culture ==
AHD is confined to the Northern hemisphere. There are about 18,235 reported cases every year with 95% hailing from China.

== Research directions ==
Wildlife research is working to detect the parasite in new areas.

<text>The Tenth Army was a field army of the British Army during the Second World War. It was created in Iraq and formed from the major part of &quot;Paiforce&quot; (Persia and Iraq Force). It was active between 1942 and 1943, and was then disbanded.

In April 1941, British and Indian troops had been deployed to Iraq from India under the command of Lieutenant-General Edward Quinan to protect British interests, in particular oil concessions, after a coup d&#x27;etat had brought to power a government sympathetic to the Axis powers. The force was known as Iraqforce and was engaged in the Anglo-Iraqi War which took place in May, and also took part in the defeat of the Vichy forces in the subsequent Syria-Lebanon campaign. Later in 1941, the force took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran to prevent the Axis elements from entering Persia, and preventing the possibility of the Germans gaining control of the Iraqi and Persian oil fields. Following this Iraqforce was renamed Paiforce (Persia and Iraq force).

After the campaigns of 1941, Quinan&#x27;s headquarters was renamed Tenth Army and its main task was the maintenance of the lines of communication to the Soviet Union from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea and the protection of the South Persian and Iraqi oilfields. Its badge was a golden Lamassu (Assyrian Ox) with human head and eagle&#x27;s wings (a Cherub Guardian). A variation of colouring of this badge was a white Ox on a pale blue background. Quinan was knighted in June 1942 and in August 1942, he was promoted to be a full general. The Tenth Army was initially part of Middle East Command but became part of Persia and Iraq Command when it was established in September 1942.

<text>Gabriel Moore (1785 – August 6, 1844) was a Democratic-Republican, later Jacksonian and National Republican politician and fifth governor of the U.S. state of Alabama (1829–1831).

==Life and politics==
Moore was born in Stokes County, North Carolina, of English descent and some French descent. He moved to Huntsville, Alabama, in 1810. Moore served in the territorial legislatures and was elected to the United States Congress in 1821. He was re-elected to the United States Congress in 1827.

Moore was the second Representative of the state of Alabama and the first Representative of its First Congressional District.

He served one term as representative of the at-large district of Alabama (1821–1823). Moore was one of four candidates in the running. Moore won with 67.57% of the vote. He served as Alabama&#x27;s 1st district representative (1823–1829). In the 1823 election, he was the only candidate and won all 3,304 votes. In the 1825 election, he was one of two candidates, the other being Clement Comer Clay. Moore won with 71.12% of the vote.

He was elected Governor of Alabama unopposed in 1829, standing as a Jacksonian. In 1831, two years into his four-year governorship, Moore resigned to seek a Class 3 spot in the Senate. In response to his resignation, Moore was replaced as Governor by Alabama Senate President Samuel B. Moore (no relation).

Moore&#x27;s Senate bid was successful, and he served for six years as Class 3 Senator alongside William R. King before losing out to John McKinley in 1837, who had preceded Moore in 1831. During his tenure in the Senate, Moore also served as chairman of the House Committee on Revolutionary Claims. In 1834, he was one of only two Anti-Jacksonian senators to vote against the censure of President Andrew Jackson.

Following his loss to McKinley, Moore moved near Caddo Lake, Texas, in 1843. He died there on August 6, 1844, and was buried on the plantation of Peter Swanson.

<text>Gary Lamell Ward (born December 6, 1953) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball from 1979 to 1990 for the Minnesota Twins, Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, and Detroit Tigers. He is the father of former major league player Daryle Ward.

==Playing career==
Ward was signed by Minnesota as an amateur free agent in 1972 and made his major league debut late in the 1979 season when he played in 10 games for the Twins. He also played 13 games for the Twins late in the 1980 season. On September 18, 1980, Ward became the sixth Twins player to hit for the cycle, doing so in the first game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Brewers at Milwaukee County Stadium. Ward&#x27;s cycle came in the 14th game of his career, which still stands as the Major League record for fewest games played until hitting for the cycle. On May 13, 2007, while playing for the San Francisco Giants, Fred Lewis hit for the cycle in the 16th game of his Major League career, narrowly missing Ward&#x27;s mark.
Ward was named the American League Rookie of the Year by &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; in 1981, and he also was named Twins Player of the Year and Most Improved Player in 1982. That season, he batted .289, with 28 home runs, 91 runs batted in, and a .519 slugging average. In 1983, he hit .278 with 19 home runs and 88 RBI, and he led all outfielders with 24 assists—the most for an American League outfielder since 1944. He was traded to the Rangers at the end of the season.

In his first season with Texas, Ward hit .284 with 21 home runs and 79 RBI, and he set a club season record with 7 triples and a personal high of 97 runs scored. He led the Rangers in batting in 1985 and 1986 (.287 and .316, respectively), and then signed with the Yankees as a free agent. He had a great first half in 1987, but he slumped badly in the second half of the season. For the following two seasons, he was a part-time player; he was released by the Yankees in mid-1989 and was signed by Detroit shortly thereafter. He finished his career with Detroit in 1990.

Ward was a two-time AL All-Star—1983 and 1985. For his career, he had a .276 batting average, 130 home runs, 1,236 hits, 597 RBI, 594 runs, 196 doubles, 41 triples, and 83 stolen bases in 1,287 games played.

==Post-playing career==
Ward has served as a coach in Minor League Baseball for several teams within the Chicago White Sox organization; the Charlotte Knights (1999–2001 and 2009–2010), Winston-Salem Dash (2011–2012 and 2014), Birmingham Barons (2013), and Arizona League White Sox (2015–2017).

On May 26, 2004, Ward&#x27;s son Daryle hit for the cycle; the Wards were the first father-son combination in major league history to hit for the cycle. They were later joined by Craig and Cavan Biggio on September 17, 2019 as the only 2 father and son duos to hit for the cycle in MLB history.

<doc id="1138146" wikidata="Q4193546" url="?curid=1138146" title="Gold certificate (United States)">
<text>Gold certificates were issued by the United States Treasury as a form of representative money from 1865 to 1933. While the United States observed a gold standard, the certificates offered a more convenient way to pay in gold than the use of coins. General public ownership of gold certificates was outlawed in 1933 and since then they have been available only to the Federal Reserve Banks, with book-entry certificates replacing the paper form.

==Overview==

Gold certificates were first authorized under the Legal Tender Act of 1863, but unlike the United States Notes also authorized, they apparently were not printed until 1865. The need for them arose from the limitations of the United States Notes. To promote the flow of gold into the Treasury and maintain the credit of the government, the notes could not be used to pay customs duties or interest on the federal debt. Gold certificates, representing coins held physically in the Treasury, were instead provided for those purposes. The notes, as legal tender for most purposes, were the dominant paper currency until 1879 but were accepted at a discount in comparison to the gold certificates. After 1879 the government started to redeem United States Notes at face value in gold, bringing them into parity with gold certificates and making the latter also a candidate for general circulation.

The first gold certificates had no series date; they were hand-dated and payable either to the bearer or to the order of a named payee. They featured a vignette of an eagle uniformly across all denominations. Later issues (series 1870, 1871, and 1875) featured portraits of historical figures. The reverse sides were either blank or featured abstract designs. The only exception was the of 1865, which had a picture of a gold coin. The Series of 1882 was the first series that was uniformly payable to the bearer; it was transferable and anyone could redeem it for the equivalent in gold. This was the case with all gold certificate series from that point on, with the exception of 1888, 1900, and 1934. The series of 1888 and 1900 were issued to specific payees as before. The series of 1882 had the same portraits as the series of 1875, but a different back design, featuring a series of eagles, as well as complex border work.

==Historic U.S. gold certificates (1863–1933)==

Gold certificates, along with all other U.S. currency, were made in two sizes—a larger size from 1865 to 1928, and a smaller size beginning with the series of 1928. The backs of all large-sized notes (and also the small-sized notes of the Series of 1934) were orange, resulting in the nickname &quot;yellow boys&quot; or &quot;goldbacks&quot;. The backs of the Series of 1928 bills were green, and identical to the corresponding denomination of the more familiar Federal Reserve Notes, including the usual buildings on the through designs and the less-known abstract designs of denominations $500 and up. Both large and small size gold certificates feature a gold treasury seal on the obverse, just as U.S. Notes feature a red seal, silver certificates (except World War II Hawaii and North Africa notes) a blue seal, and Federal Reserve Notes a green seal.

In the case of the Series 1928 (small-size) gold certificates, they bore a redemption statement with the following text: &quot;This certifies that there have been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America XXXXX Dollars in Gold Coin payable to the bearer on demand.&quot;

===Series of 1900 Gold Certificates===
Another interesting note is the Series of 1900. Along with the and of the Series of 1888, all 1900 bills ( denomination only) have been redeemed, and no longer have legal tender status. Most were destroyed, with the exception of a number of 1900 bills that were in a box in a post office near the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C. There was a fire on December 13, 1935, and employees threw burning boxes out into the street. The box of canceled high-denomination currency burst open. Much to everyone&#x27;s dismay, they were worthless. There are several hundred outstanding, and their ownership is technically illegal, as they are stolen property. However, due to their lack of intrinsic value, the government has not prosecuted any owners, citing more important concerns. They carry a collector value in the numismatic market and, as noted in Bowers and Sundman&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest American Currency Notes&quot;, the only United States notes that can be purchased for less than their face value. This is the only example of &quot;circulating&quot; U.S. currency that is not an obligation of the government, and thus not redeemable by a Federal Reserve Bank. The note bears the portrait of Andrew Jackson and has no printed design on its reverse side.

==End of the Gold Certificate Era in the United States (March 1933)==
As part of the Roosevelt Administration&#x27;s response to the effects of the Great Depression and particularly the outflow of gold for hoarding and for shipment overseas, the practice of redeeming gold certificates for gold coin was ended by Presidential Proclamation 2039 (dated March 6, 1933) and Executive Order 6073 (dated March 10, 1933). On April 5, 1933, Executive Order 6102 was issued; it required all persons in the United States to deliver (with limited exceptions) all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates to the Federal Reserve by May 1, 1933. By order of the Secretary of the Treasury dated December 28, 1933, private possession of gold certificates was declared illegal. Due to their (then-) illegal status and public fear that the notes would be devalued and made obsolete, this resulted in the majority of circulating notes being retired.

The restrictions on private ownership of gold certificates were revoked by Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon effective April 24, 1964, primarily to allow collectors to own examples legally; however, gold certificates are no longer redeemable for gold, but instead can be exchanged at face value for other U.S. coin and currency designated as legal tender (e.g., Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes). In general, the notes are scarce and valuable, especially examples in &quot;new&quot; condition.

===Series of 1934 Gold Certificates; Modern usage by the Federal Reserve System===
The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 established a new accounting mechanism, through the issue of a special series of gold certificates, to account for gold held by the Federal Reserve Banks on behalf of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to &quot;prescribe the form and denominations of the certificates&quot;.

The Series of 1934 (bearing the signatures of William Alexander Julian (Treasurer) and Henry Morgenthau (Treasury Secretary)) consisted of the following denominations: ; ; and (mirroring the circulating Federal Reserve Notes of the same series and denominations). However, there was also a denomination (bearing the portrait of President Woodrow Wilson) that had no equivalent in other types of U.S. currency and was also the largest currency denomination ever issued by the United States Treasury. 42,000 of the denomination were printed. According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing&#x27;s own website, the certificates were printed between December 18, 1934, and January 9, 1935. These notes were never intended for circulation in the general economy and there are no known instances of any such certificates ever being released outside government channels, other than as specimens such as one recently graded by PMG. 

Reflecting the purpose for which these certificates were issued, the redemption statement on their face was changed to read as follows: &quot;This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America XXXXX Dollars in Gold payable to bearer on demand as authorized by law.&quot;

Since the 1960s, most of the paper certificates have been destroyed, and the currently prescribed form of the &quot;certificates&quot; issued to the Federal Reserve is an electronic book entry account between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The electronic book entry system also allows for the various regional Federal Reserve Banks to exchange certificate balances among themselves. However, the Treasury authorized a small amount of them to be retained at certain Federal Reserve Banks (where they had been used) for educational and historical purposes, such as being placed on public display. In addition, a Series of 1934 gold certificate is part of the numismatic collection at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

As of December 2013 the Federal Reserve reported holding .037 billion (face value) of these certificates. The Treasury backs these certificates by holding an equivalent amount of gold at the statutory exchange rate of 2/9 per troy ounce of gold, though the Federal Reserve does not have the right to exchange the certificates for gold. As the certificates are denominated in dollars rather than in a set weight of gold, any change in the statutory exchange rate towards the (much higher) market rate would result in a windfall accounting gain for the Treasury.

<doc id="1138148" wikidata="Q5612122" url="?curid=1138148" title="Grunge speak">
<text>Grunge speak was a hoax series of slang words purportedly connected to the subculture of grunge in Seattle, reported as fact in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1992. The collection of alleged slang words were coined by a record label worker in response to a journalist asking if grunge musicians and enthusiasts had their own slang terms, seeking to write a piece on the subject. They were essentially made up on the spot; there was no such vernacular among members of the grunge scene, and the terms that were published were merely a prank on the news industry&#x27;s tendencies to seize upon trends.

==History==
The words later labelled &quot;grunge speak&quot; were coined by Megan Jasper, then aged 25 and working for Caroline Records. She had previously worked for Sub Pop Records, whose co-founder Jonathan Poneman referred journalists to her, ostensibly for her inside knowledge of grunge, but also because of her prankish streak. She was telephoned first by UK magazine &quot;SKY&quot; and later by Rick Marin for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Poneman forewarned Jasper that Marin was seeking &quot;a lexicon of grunge&quot;; Jasper recalled Marin explaining, &quot;Every subculture has a different way of speaking and there&#x27;s got to be words and phrases and things that you folks say.&quot; Jasper tested her interviewers&#x27; gullibility by supplying invented slang expressions of increasing ridiculousness.

A on the September 1992 issue of &quot;SKY&quot; said &quot; — How to hang out in Seattle&quot;, trailing a four-page article which mentioned some of Jasper&#x27;s expressions. Seattle band Mudhoney saw the article while on tour in the UK and joined in the joke by reusing some terms in an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Marin&#x27;s article, &quot;Grunge: A Success Story&quot;, appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 15, 1992, as a full page story in its Sunday &quot;Styles&quot; section. The article begins with an investigation on the origin of the term &quot;grunge&quot; and concludes with a summary of grunge music and fashion. Jasper&#x27;s invented terms were published as a sidebar to Marin&#x27;s story, titled &quot;Lexicon of Grunge: Breaking the Code&quot; and crediting Jasper for &quot;this lexicon of grunge-speak&quot;. The list was reprinted by the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; in December.

Thomas Frank was skeptical of the &quot;Times&quot;″ lexicon, and contacted Jasper, who &quot;readily admitted&quot; the fabrication, as Frank reported in the Winter–Spring 1993 issue of &quot;The Baffler&quot;. The &quot;Baffler&quot; story was picked up by news media, including Calvin Trillin&#x27;s syndicated column. When the &quot;Times&quot; got back to Jasper, she initially denied Frank&#x27;s claims, so the &quot;Times&quot; demanded an apology from Frank. Instead, he sent a letter standing by the story: &quot;When The Newspaper of Record goes searching for the Next Big Thing and the Next Big Thing piddles on its leg, we think that&#x27;s funny.&quot; He considered the article to be part of an attempt by mainstream culture to co-opt the grunge scene and felt that the &quot;Times&quot; had gotten what it deserved. Jasper later ascribed her initial denial to a fear that Marin or &quot;Styles&quot; editor Penelope Green would be fired. Green commented to the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, &quot;Our piece was tongue-in-cheek, so I guess [the hoax] works. But how irritating.&quot; She prepared a correction but the &quot;Times&quot; never published it.

==Grunge speak words==
The following were in the &quot;Times&quot; lexicon:
*bloated, big bag of bloatation – drunk
*bound-and-hagged – staying home on Friday or Saturday night
*cob nobbler – loser
*dish – desirable guy
*fuzz – heavy wool sweaters
*harsh realm – bummer
*kickers – heavy boots
*lamestain – uncool person
*plats – platform shoes
*rock on – a happy goodbye
*score – great
*swingin&#x27; on the flippity-flop – hanging out
*tom-tom club – uncool outsiders
*wack slacks – old ripped jeans

Jasper had also offered tuna platter (&quot;a hot date&quot;), and regretted that it had not appeared in the article.

==Legacy==
Daniel House, the head of C/Z Records commissioned Art Chantry to design a lexicon T-shirt after people started wearing the sidebar from the article pinned to their shirts at grunge shows. Chantry&#x27;s design featured &quot;Lamestain&quot; or &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; on the front, with an enlarged copy of the lexicon sidebar on the back.

&quot;Harsh Realm&quot; was a 1994 comic book series by James D. Hudnall and Andrew Paquette, set in a future of multiple virtual realities, one of which was a dystopia called &quot;Harsh Realm&quot;. In 1999 Chris Carter adapted the &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; comics into a television series of the same name. 

In Adam Warren&#x27;s comic &quot;The Dirty Pair&quot;, the characters&#x27; futuristic slang includes &quot;harsh realm&quot; in the grunge-speak sense.

Bass guitarist Dave Brockie&#x27;s stage persona in the band X-Cops was &quot;Ex-Patrolman Cobb Knobbler&quot;.

The 1996 documentary &quot;Hype!&quot; included Jasper&#x27;s prank in its exploration of the early 1990s grunge scene.

<doc id="1138149" wikidata="Q5330860" url="?curid=1138149" title="Easton Neston house">
<text>Easton Neston is a large grade I listed country house in the parish of Easton Neston near Towcester in Northamptonshire, England. It was built by William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster (1648–1711), in the Baroque style to the design of the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor.

Easton Neston is thought to be the only mansion which was solely the work of Hawksmoor. From about 1700, after the completion of Easton Neston, Hawksmoor worked with Sir John Vanbrugh on many buildings, including Castle Howard and Blenheim Palace, and often provided technical knowledge to the less qualified Vanbrugh. Hawksmoor&#x27;s work was always more classically severe than Vanbrugh&#x27;s. However, Easton Neston predates this partnership by some six years.

==Architect==

Hawksmoor was commissioned to re-build the old manor house at Easton Neston by Sir William Fermor, later created Baron Leominster, who had inherited the estate from his father Sir William Fermor, 1st Baronet (1621–1661), who had himself inherited it in 1640 and had been created a baronet the following year by King Charles I. Hawksmoor had been recommended to Fermor by his cousin by marriage Sir Christopher Wren, who in about 1680 had advised on the building of a new mansion on the site.

No details of what Wren envisaged survive, and work seems to have ceased following completion of the two service blocks, of which only one survives. Following Fermor&#x27;s marriage in 1692 to the wealthy heiress Catherine Poulett, he decided to resurrect the idea of a new mansion, and subsequently Wren&#x27;s pupil Hawksmoor received the commission in about 1694. A 300-word letter written and signed by Wren in approximately 1685 has survived, reflecting the advice he offered concerning the construction of Easton Neston. The letter was acquired in March 2011 at auction for an estimated £9,000, and later sold for £19,200.

In May 2011, BBC broadcast a programme on Easton Neston, &quot;The Country House Revealed&quot;, narrated by British architectural historian Dan Cruickshank. The programme explored the question of whether Wren or Hawksmoor designed the building. Cruickshank obtained samples of wood from the building&#x27;s roof; date tests on the samples revealed they originated from trees that were cut down between 1700 and 1701, which was proposed as evidence suggesting that Hawksmoor, not Wren, may have been the architect.

==Exterior==

Fermor had purchased a large collection of marble statues from the Arundel collection some of which he used to decorate the estate. These were removed and sold together with other items by George Fermor, 2nd Earl of Pomfret (1722–1785) (son of the 1st Earl), then in financial difficulties, and were bought by his mother Henrietta Jeffreys, daughter of John Jeffreys, 2nd Baron Jeffreys of Wem, who in 1755 donated them to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

The house Hawksmoor built at Easton Neston can best be described as a miniature palace that owes the colossal order of pilasters and crowning balustrade to the proposed design by Gabriel of the Petit Trianon at Versailles, which building was not completed until about 50 years after Easton Neston, engravings of which design were published in &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;. Gabriel&#x27;s design was itself influenced by the palazzi on the Campidoglio in Rome by Michelangelo (d.1564). Both main façades of Easton Neston are of simple design, devoid of ostentation.

The rectangular house comprises three principal floors. The lowest is a rusticated basement, above ground level, with the two floors above appearing to have equal value, including nine bays divided by Composite pilasters, each bay containing a tall, slim sash window of the same height on each floor. The central bay contains the entrance, flanked by two Composite full columns. These two columns support a small, round-headed pediment displaying the Fermor arms and heraldic motto. Above the door at second floor height is a massive Venetian window. The roof-line is concealed by a balustrade which is decorated by covered stone urns at the ten intervals above the pilasters below. The design and fenestration of the entrance façade is repeated at the rear on the garden façade, except that the roof balustrade at the rear is undecorated by urns and pediment. The house is built of Helmdon stone, a cream stone of exceptional quality, which has ensured that the carving appears as crisp today as it was on completion of the house in 1702.

The two side elevations of the house tell the story of life in a country house before the age of the servants&#x27; bell. Until the invention of the remote bell situated in the servants&#x27; hall, which could be jangled by a system of ropes and pulleys from far away, it was necessary for servants to be located within earshot of a hand-bell or call of the voice. In older houses such as Montacute House servants slept on the floor of the great hall or outside the door of their master&#x27;s bedchamber; by the 17th century this arrangement was becoming undesirable. Houses then began to have corridors, and the owners, rather than stepping over sleeping servants, began to tidy them away in small rooms, sometimes containing their employer&#x27;s close-stool. However, these small rooms still had to be within calling distance.

In a brand-new, luxurious house such as Easton Neston, this was achieved by inserting two very low-ceilinged mezzanine staff floors between each of the two upper floors. Hence at Easton Neston, while the two principal façades (West and East) are of three floors, the fenestration of the two less important side façades betrays the secret that there are in fact five floors: the windows of the two mezzanines, as befits the humble rooms they light, are a mere half of the size of those of the grander rooms above and below them. This makes the fenestration of the side façades a complex and interesting sight.

Some years after completion of the house in 1702, Hawksmoor drew-up further plans for a huge entrance court. These designs, never fully executed but published in &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, would have flanked the existing rectangular house with two wings, one containing stables and the other service rooms. The fourth (entrance) side of the courtyard was to have been an elaborate colonnade.

No substantial part of this later scheme was built, except for two large and now decayed Ozymandian entrance piers, marooned in the park. The two pre-existing red-brick wings, perhaps owing something to Christopher Wren, remained, although the western (stable) wing was later demolished after the new stables were built. Some architectural commentators, including Dan Cruickshank feel that Hawksmoor&#x27;s mansion might have been spoilt by this new scheme, which owed more to Sir John Vanbrugh&#x27;s architectural concepts than to Hawksmoor&#x27;s. The whole proposed new design was depicted in Colen Campbell&#x27;s 1715 work &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, as though it had in fact been built.

==Interior==
The principal rooms have windows rising almost from the floor to the ceiling. The rooms are large and well proportioned without suffering from the oppressive grandeur that was to be a feature of Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor&#x27;s later collaborative work. The massive main staircase, with its wrought iron balustrade in the style of Jean Tijou, comprises two long, shallow flights ascending to the first floor gallery which is decorated with grisailles painted by Sir James Thornhill.

Interiors at Easton Neston have suffered various changes since Hawksmoor completed the house. Hawksmoor&#x27;s great hall, with its two-storey high, bare walls and flanking vestibules and Corinthian columns, was sub-divided in the 19th century by Sir Thomas Hesketh, who inherited the property from his uncle, to create an upper storey containing three bedrooms. The principal drawing room, the only heavily decorated room in the house, has also seen change in the form of decorative plasterwork carried out by Artari in the mid-18th century for Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret (1698–1753), comprising a high-relief ceiling matched on the walls by huge scrolled panels and picture surrounds, with trophies containing hunting emblems.

==Gardens==
In the park, Hawksmoor also designed a canal to complement the house, known as the Long Water; this is on an axis with the entrance door at the centre of the garden façade. In the 20th century the gardens overlooked by the west, or garden façade, were further enhanced by the creation of a water terrace, by Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, 1st Baron Hesketh (1881–1944), the great-nephew of the 5th and last Earl of Pomfret. It is decorated by box topiary and roses surrounding a large pool, which reflects the house in its water.

==History==
For the major part of its existence, including into the 21st century, Easton Neston has been a private house and never opened to the public; as a consequence it is little known.

In March 1876, Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited England and rented Easton Neston House, using its fine stables for her horses. She used Blisworth railway station for travel to London.

In 2004, Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh, a descendant of the builder via a female line, put the house, and the surrounding estate including Towcester Racecourse, up for sale for an asking price of £50 million. He received no offers and consequently in 2005, he sold the estate piecemeal. A part of the estate, including the main house, some outlying buildings and of land, were sold for about £15 million to Leon Max, a retail businessman and designer. Lord Hesketh subsequently sold off the farmland and the Gothic village of Hulcote, but retained ownership of Towcester Racecourse.

As of 2005, Max planned to use the Wren-designed wing of the house as a headquarters for his European operations, and the Hawksmoor block as his personal residence.

==The Hesketh Library==
The library at Easton Neston was formerly the home of a substantial collection of rare books and manuscripts, largely created by Frederick Fermor-Hesketh, 2nd Baron Hesketh. In 2006 the collection was deposited on loan at the library of Lancaster University, the Hesketh family having its origins in Lancashire. However, these were subsequently withdrawn from the university. In 2010 the trustees of the 2nd Baron&#x27;s will trust sold some of his books, manuscripts and letters at Sotheby&#x27;s.

<text>Gurgel Motores () was a Brazilian automobile manufacturer, named after its founder João do Amaral Gurgel. The company was founded in 1969 and first specialised in buggies and off-road vehicles. Early models were fiberglass bodies installed on Volkswagen Beetle chassis and machinery, but VW bodies and chassis were later replaced by a unique solution made of , which consists of fiberglass and steel joined, a system patented by Gurgel. Gurgel also introduced Brazil&#x27;s first fully domestically designed and manufactured car, the BR-800.

== History ==

=== Rise and growth (1969–1987) ===
The Ipanema was the first car produced by Gurgel, introducing the brand in the market. The next model was the first commercial success of the brand: the Xavante (also named X-10): production started in 1973, being the first car of Gurgel developed using the system, which was proved very resistant under corrosive environments and also very mechanically strong, deforming temporarily but not smashing under pressure or shocks. Xavante also had a feature called Selectraction, a system where two individual hand-brakes were installed next to the driver, for each one of the rear wheels. In a situation of low-traction environment, it could be used to stop a free-spinning wheel and move the power to the other one, allowing the driver to restore traction to the ground and to move along. There was a more sophisticated version of X-10 called X-12, which was the biggest commercial success of the brand.

In 1974, the Itaipu was a pioneer project of an electric vehicle, which was developed to be a strict urban car for short distances. However, due to the limited technology of the batteries of that time – they were too heavy and had low capacity – the project was halted. Still, in 1980 another electric vehicle was conceived, called Itaipu E400: it was a van, still designed for urban travels, but making a better autonomy and still a remarkable mileage. The same body was also listed in brochures as available with a petrol engine, as the &quot;G-800&quot;.

In 1979, the X-15 was released, being a van which could carry 7 passengers, or 2 passengers plus 500 kg of load. A derived model, the G-15L, could carry 1 ton of load, having 70L of gasoline capacity, which could be extended to 140L, with an additional tank.

At that time, business was going quite well: Gurgel was the first exporter in special vehicles, and the second in production and amount, in 1977 and 1978.

In 1981, the XEF model was developed, having only three front seats, an unusual solution at the time. The car was an urban model, with small dimensions for the passengers and for the luggage.

In 1984, the Carajás model was introduced: it presented the same Selectraction system as Xavante and X-12, but had some special qualities, such as the TTS (Tork Tubing System), used to transfer the power from the engine, on the front of the vehicle, to the transmission, on the rear. The system gave a good weight balance for the system, but presented some collateral effects, such as the need for a slower shift change, due to the inertia of the TTS.

=== Urban vehicles (1987–1993) ===

A small, economic, and totally national car was the goal for João Gurgel for a long time. On September 7 of 1987, a day Gurgel himself called &quot;the day of the Brazilian technological independence&quot;, the project CENA was presented. The first minicar of the brand was designed to be the cheaper and more economic car offered in the market. For this project, a tax benefit was granted, reducing the IPI to 5%, aiming at increasing competitiveness with big automakers.
The car presented a big step in the national technology development: the engine, named Gurgel Enertron, was entirely designed and developed by Gurgel, low cost : it was a bi-cylindrical engine, originally with 650 cc and 800 cc options, equipped with totally electronic ignition control, using a system with two coils and no distributor. It had a good mileage, making 14 km/L on urban traffic, and could achieve 19 km/L on the road, on constant speed, even without any electronic fuel injection.

The engine was very similar to the VW Beetle boxer engine, even sharing some internal parts with it, but had many improvements: a sealed water-cooled system, better compression ratio and a different ignition system. Unlike the VW boxer, it could be taken to near 6000 rpm without any valve float.

The first model based on the original project was the BR-800, available only with the 800 cc engine option, generating 32 PS of power. It was a direct implementation of the project, with minor changes and improvements. Like other vehicles from the brand, the car had a body made using the Plasteel system, weighing only 650 kg and measuring 3.19 meters, still being the smallest car ever produced in Brazil.

It was first sold in 1988 in a system where the buyer had to acquire shares from Gurgel in order to buy the car. The car cost about US$5,000, but the buyer had to buy 750 shares for another US$5,000 in order to get a car, making it considerably more expensive than a US$7,000 Chevrolet Chevette, the then cheapest car in the Brazilian market. This system lasted until 1990, when the car was sold independently of the shares. In this same year, the federal government changed the rules to give the same reduction of the IPI to all cars below 1000 cc, thus enabling Gurgel&#x27;s competitors to develop one-litre models of existing cars.

In 1992, in a response to the market, the Supermini model was created: it had a better finish, more power (36 PS), a lot of improvement in the body, including a more robust suspension, a better system for the windows and a real lid for the trunk.

=== Last projects and bankruptcy (1993–1994) ===

When president Fernando Collor went to office in March, 1990, he soon opened the Brazilian market to foreign products. Even considering the high import taxes, national industry from the time suffered from the new external competition, and things weren&#x27;t different for Gurgel. The Carajás, which had been Brazil&#x27;s best selling SUV, was taken out of production in early 1991 as the Lada Niva arrived in the Brazilian market.
The president also extended the IPI reduction of Gurgel BR-800 to all vehicles below 1,000 cc. Fiat quickly responded by launching the Uno Mille, and other automakers soon followed with their own one-litre cars. This step was considered by many &quot;Gurgelistas&quot; a kind of betrayal from the government, as the prices of these vehicles was now very similar. In 1991 Gurgel released the Motomachine, a shortened two-seater roadster based on the BR-800. Only 177 of these were built in 1991.

However, Gurgel had gained a lot of experience and feedback from the customers and investors during the BR-800 sales, and with that input in mind they started a new project called Gurgel Delta. This project was intended to be cheaper than the BR-800, aimed at the lower economic classes, being produced in a new plant near the target market: the northeast.

Governors of state of Ceará and São Paulo signed a letter of intent in December 1991, where they confirmed interest to fund Gurgel in US$30 million and US$50 million each. BNDES would also join if both states confirmed the funding, adding US$25 million. By that time, Gurgel had already bought the ground of 650000 square meters, needed for the new factory facilities, and negotiated with Citroën the purchase of machinery used for 2CV production.

However, the state of Ceará did not confirm the funding in succeeding years, leading to the loss of support from São Paulo and BNDES. The schedule for production of the new car was delayed, and in 1993 Gurgel entered a preventive bankruptcy. Gurgel still tried reaching an agreement with the federal government, presenting the Delta project to then-President Itamar Franco.

This presentation resulted in a technical note from the (now extinct) MICT (&quot;Ministério de Indústria, Comércio e Turismo&quot;, or &quot;Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism&quot; in English) saying that &quot;immediate actions needed to be taken&quot;, treating the matter as of &quot;national interest&quot;. Still, no funding was produced, and on March 1, 1994, Gurgel had it first collapse. The administration appealed, but it was already too late, and at the end of 1994 the doors were finally closed and locked.

=== Current days (2000 and beyond) ===

The trademark Gurgel expired, was bought by another business, and is now used by a small Brazilian importer of tricycles. The current Gurgel has nothing in common with the original Gurgel company, except the name.

The vehicles produced by the original factory are still running on Brazilian roads nowadays. It is not uncommon to see X-12, Tocantins, Supermini or BR-800 models on the streets, despite the reduced number of specialized workshops and lack of specific parts for replacement.

Gurgel&#x27;s founder and owner João do Amaral Gurgel was born in 1926. A few years after Gurgel&#x27;s bankruptcy, João do Amaral Gurgel developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on January 30, 2009, in São Paulo, due to complications from the disease.

== Vehicles produced ==

* Gurgel Moplast: A very small vehicle, with fiberglass body.
* Gurgel Ipanema: A dune buggy, bigger than Moplast, based on VW platform with fiberglass body.
* Gurgel Xavante X10: With a new chassis made of fiberglass over a steel framework and VW Beetle engine and transmission, this small off-road car showed its dune buggy roots but with a more Jeep-like styling and intended usage. Some thousands produced in 1970 decade. Early models had more rounded, dune buggy-like lines, while later ones are more square and Jeep-like.
* Gurgel Xavante X11: Similar to Xavante X10, but from late 1970 decade. Some thousands produced.
* Gurgel Xavante X12: Also similar to Xavante X10. Some thousands produced in the 1980s.
* Gurgel Itaipu: The first project for an electric car, still the only electric car ever produced in Brazilian history. First produced in 1973. Only a few of these tiny two-seater cars were produced and they were not sold since the car never developed past the prototype stage. The car was named after a huge hydro power plant on the border of Brazil and Paraguay.
* Gurgel Tocantins: An evolution of Xavante X12. Bigger motor, 4 X 2 and also with fiberglass chassis. It was a commercial success, exported to 40 countries.
* Gurgel Carajás: A large SUV powered by a 1.8 water-cooled engine from the Volkswagen Santana. The engine was mounted at the front, with rear transmission. The last Gurgel Carajás was produced in January 1991. After the Carajás, no more Gurgel SUVs were made. The rare Carajás VIP has four doors.
* Gurgel X15: A pick-up with a number of different body types, few units produced. The G15 has a longer wheelbase but is otherwise similar.
* Gurgel X20: Another pick-up, few units produced.
* Gurgel Itaipu E400/E500: An electric-powered pickup/delivery van, with few units produced.
* Gurgel G800: An internal combustion engine version of the E500, few units produced.
* Gurgel XEF: City car shaped like a saloon, powered by Volkswagen&#x27;s air-cooled 1.6 engine from the original Beetle. Only one hundred Gurgel XEF were made. It had an unusual three-occupant configuration, with each occupant sitting side-by-side.
* Gurgel BR-800: City car built from 1988 to 1991. In order to buy one from the first lot, the customer had to acquire shares from the Gurgel brand, as a way to capitalize the factory. After 1990, the shares acquisition was no longer necessary. It sold reasonably well in 1989 and 1990, but sales dwindled in 1990 after IPI reduction of other cars in the segment.
* Gurgel Supermini: The BR-800 evolution, built from 1991 to 1994. More improved and with better finish that BR-800.
* Gurgel Motomachine: A smaller two-seat roadster version of the Supermini, only 177 were produced in 1991.

<doc id="1138152" wikidata="Q5721114" url="?curid=1138152" title="Henry Farm">
<text>Henry Farm is a neighbourhood in the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the north central part of the city within the former city of North York.

The City of Toronto has officially designated the neighbourhood of Henry Farm to encompass the Parkway Forest residential subdivision, between Don Mills Road and Highway 404. The neighbourhood is served by the Henry Farm Community Interest Association.

==History==

Henry Farm was settled in 1806 by Henry Mulholland, a native of Clones, County Monaghan, Ireland. He sold the farm in 1814 to William Marsh Jr and past through a few owners including Mulholland&#x27;s son-in-law (married to daughter Mary Ann), but his great-grandson, George Stewart Henry (son of Louisa Stewart and grandson to Mary Ann Mulholland), reacquired it in 1898. Henry was the tenth Premier of Ontario from 1930 to 1934. Ten days before his death in 1958, Henry sold his farm for to the developers of the present-day neighbourhood. Henry&#x27;s house, called &quot;Oriole Lodge&quot;, still stands as a private residence at 17 Manorpark Court.

Henry Farm was developed into a housing subdivision in the 1960s. Most of the neighbourhood consists of low density suburban housing. Along the northeast and southeast are townhouse developments. The latter are primarily social housing. There are also two high-rise apartment buildings, Havenbrook Towers, at the southeast corner.

There is one church, located at 80 George Henry Boulevard, which houses the St. Matthew the Apostle, Oriole Anglican Church of Canada congregation. The church was built in 1969 and dedicated on January 25, 1970. The site was shared with the Covenant United Church. Covenant United Church amalgamated with Donway United Church in 1992, and moved out of Henry Farm.

==Education==
The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a public school board that operates two elementary schools in Henry Farm, Forest Manor Public School, and Shaughnessy Public School. TDSB does not operate a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TDSB students attending secondary schools in adjacent neighbourhoods.

In addition to TDSB, three other public school board also offers schooling to residents of Don Mills, the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), secular school board; and two French first language public school board, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM). However, none of the three school boards operate school in Don Mills, with CSCM, CSV, and TCDSB students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

==Recreation==
The neighbourhood is home to several municipal parks, including Havenbrook Park, and Parkway Forest Park. Havenbrook Park has a baseball diamond, toboggan hill and the Henry Farm Tennis Club. The park is situated near the Don Valley, which forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks in Toronto are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The division also manages a community centre in the neighbourhood, Parkway Forest Community Centre.

==Transportation==

Several major thoroughfares bound the neighbourhood. Sheppard Avenue is a roadway that bounds Henry Farm in the north, while Highway 404 bounds the residential neighbourhood to the east. Highway 404 to provides access to York Region to the north and south to the Don Valley Parkway which starts at the 401/404 interchange just south of Sheppard Avenue. Highway 404 serves as a point of division between the primarily residential neighbourhood and the Consumers Business Park a commercial area to the east of the 404. The Business Park runs east to the Victoria Park Avenue. Highway 401 is the other major controlled access highway that bounds the neighbourhood from the south. The highway provides east–west access to the rest of Greater Toronto, and southern Ontario. The Don River&#x27;s East Branch is the natural border to the west that passes under the Sheppard Avenue and Leslie Street intersection

Public transportation in the neighbourhood is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), operating several bus routes through the neighbourhood. In addition, the Toronto subway may be accessed from Don Mills station, located at Don Mills Road, and Sheppard Avenue. Access to bus routes operated by York Region Transit may also be accessed at Don Mills station.

<doc id="1138156" wikidata="Q622776" url="?curid=1138156" title="Sciri">
<text>The Sciri, or Scirians, were a Germanic people. They are believed to have spoken an East Germanic language. Their name probably means &quot;the pure ones&quot;.

The Sciri were mentioned already in the late 3rd century BC as participants in a raid on the city of Olbia near modern-day Odesa. In the late 4th century they lived somewhere north of the Black Sea and Lower Danube in the vicinity of the Goths. By the early 5th century, the Sciri had been subdued by the Huns, whom they fought under at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 AD.

After the death of Attila, the Sciri broke free from Hunnic rule at the Battle of Nedao in 454 AD. They subsequently were recorded holding their own kingdom north of the Middle Danube, under the leadership of Edeko and his son Onoulphus. After the destruction of this kingdom by the Ostrogoths in the late 460s AD, Odoacer, another son of Edeko, attained high status within the Roman army in Italy, ruling Sciri, Rugii and other non-Roman peoples as a king. Odoacer eventually made himself King of Italy in 476 AD, effectively ending the Western Roman Empire.

Odoacer was in turn deposed and killed by Theodoric the Great in 493 AD. Along with the Rugii, Heruli and other Middle Danubian peoples, the Sciri might also have contributed to the formation of the Bavarii.

==Name==
Since the 19th century, the etymology of the Sciri name has been connected to such Germanic words as Gothic &quot;skeirs&quot; (&quot;sheer&quot;, &quot;pure&quot;). Rudolf Much, in the first edition of the &quot;Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&quot; pointed out that this could be interpreted three ways: &quot;bright&quot; (&quot;clari, splendidi&quot;), &quot;honest&quot; (&quot;candidi, sinceri&quot;) or &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;unmixed&quot;, and he mentioned that the latter racial implication might make sense for a people living near a borderland. In more recent times scholars such as Herwig Wolfram have often accepted this latter idea, interpreting the name &quot;Sciri&quot; to mean &quot;the pure ones&quot;, and contrasting their name with that of the neighboring Bastarnae, who were ethnically mixed according to this interpretation, and thus, according to this account, named &quot;the bastards&quot;.

Not all scholars have accepted this. Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez, for example, suggested an Iranian etymology for Sciri, relating it to the Middle Persian &quot;shīr&quot; (&quot;milk, lion&quot;). This theory was dismissed by Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen.

==Language==
The Sciri are believed to have been Germanic-speaking. In 1947, for example, Maenchen-Helfen argued that while Huns also often used Germanic names, all three known personal names of the leaders of the Sciri, the family of Odoacer, were Germanic, making the case stronger. However, it is commonly accepted by scholars since then that Odoacer&#x27;s father was described in one classical source as a Hun, and that there are different ways of explaining his name. Some scholars thus propose that Odoacer&#x27;s mother was his connection to the Sciri, while others feel that being called a Hun in one context did not make it impossible to be called something else in another, and that in any case it is likely that Odoacer had a &quot;polyethnic&quot; background.

More specifically, the Sciri are believed to have spoken an East Germanic language like the Goths.

==Classification==
The Sciri are classified as a Germanic people by modern scholars. More specifically, they are frequently grouped together with the Goths, Vandals, Heruli, Rugii, Gepids and Burgundians as East Germanic peoples.

In late Roman times, many East Germanic peoples, in addition to the non-Germanic Alans, were often referred to as &quot;Gothic&quot; peoples. On at least one occasion, Procopius included the Sciri in such a list, together with the Alans. The Sciri were not classified as Germanic in ancient sources.

Reynolds and Lopez doubted that the Sciri were Germanic-language-speaking, and rather suggested that they might have been Balts or Sarmatians. These doubts were rejected by Maenchen-Helfen, who considered it certain that the Sciri were Germanic.

==History==
===Origins and early history===
The Bastarnae, Sciri and Vandals are believed to have been present near the Vistula by the 3rd century BC. The Sciri were first mentioned in the Protogenes inscription of Olbia, which describes attacks upon the northern Black Sea coast by the &quot;Galatians&quot; and &quot;Sciri&quot; (Γαλάτας και Σκίρους). This inscription is dated to approximately 220–200 BC. The &quot;Galatians&quot; in this inscription are frequently identified as the Bastarnae, who are believed to have been a Germanic people with Celtic influences. It is thus believed that both the Bastarnae and Sciri had arrived in this area in the early 3rd century BC. The Bastarnae and Sciri are generally associated with the . Historian Roger Batty has also associated them with the Zarubintsy culture.

The Sciri are not mentioned in the works of Julius Caesar or Tacitus. The 1st century Roman writer Pliny the Elder described the peoples inhabiting the region east of the Vistula, as the Sarmatians, Venedi, &quot;Sciri&quot; and Hirri.

The Sciri are believed to have been one of several Germanic speaking peoples, including the Goths and Rugii, who had moved from the Polish region towards the Black Sea by the 3rd century AD. Around 300 AD, the Verona List of &quot;barbarians&quot; living near the Roman Empire mentions the Sciri between the Sarmatians to the west and the Carpi to the east. Walter Goffart suggests that they lived in the Lower Danube valley. Peter Heather suggests that the Sciri lived east of the Carpathians in the 4th century, while Malcolm Todd suggests that they lived north of the Black Sea.

===The Sciri under Hunnic rule===

In the late 4th century AD, the Sciri were conquered by the Huns. In 381 AD a force of Sciri, Carpi and some Huns crossed the lower Danube into the Roman Empire. They were forced back by the emperor Theodosius.

Sometime in the late 4th or early 5th century, the Sciri are believed to have moved westwards into the Middle Danube region. Here they formed part of a polity established by the Hunnic leader Uldin. In 409 AD the Sciri and Huns under Uldin crossed the Danube and invaded the Roman Balkans. They captured Castra Martis, but were eventually defeated and Uldin was killed. While the Hunnic prisoners were drafted into the Roman army, captured Sciri were enslaved and sent as &quot;coloni&quot; to Anatolia. The Sciri were a numerous people at this time, and the &quot;coloni&quot; were distributed over a widespread area in order to prevent them from revolting. These events are described in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;.

During the height of the Hunnic empire under their leader Attila, the Sciri were subjects of Attila and provided potent infantry for him. Attila&#x27;s empire included not only Huns and Sciri, but also Goths, Gepids, Thuringi, Rugii, Suebi, Heruli, Alans and Sarmatians. The Sciri participated in Attila&#x27;s invasion of Gaul in 451 AD.

As the Hunnic empire disintegrated, one group of Sciri were settled in the Roman empire in Scythia Minor and Lower Moesia south of the Lower Danube. Jordanes mentions four tribes that remained loyal to the Huns under Dengizich: Ultzinzures, Bittugures, Bardores and Angisciri. The last might be a Scirian remnant. The name Angisciri has been analyzed as Germanic for &quot;grassland Sciri&quot;, but it may be an unrelated Turkic name since the other three names in the list are Turkic.

===Independent kingdom===
After the death of Attila, the Sciri, Heruli, Rugii and others joined Ardaric of the Gepids in a revolt against the Huns, winning a major victory at the Battle of Nedao in 454 AD. In the aftermath, Edeko established a Scirian kingdom in the Middle Alföld between the Middle Danube and the Tisza rivers, which he ruled together with his sons Odoacer and Onoulphus. A man by the name of Edeko had previously been a trusted advisor of Attila, and this Edeko is generally believed to have been the same person as the one who established the Scirian kingdom. Edeko had served at one point as Attila&#x27;s envoy to Constantinople, and once prevented an assassination plot against him. Edeko was probably not a Scirian himself, but was married to a Scirian noblewoman. He is believed to have been either a Thuringian or a Hun, or perhaps of mixed Thuringian-Hunnic ancestry. A Thuringian origin of Edeko is attested by Malchus through the Suda, while a Hunnic origin of Edeko is attested by Priscus. Goffart refers to Edeko as a Hun. Heather considers a Thurungian origin more specific and thus more likely. The Thurungi were also a Germanic people.

In the subsequent years the Sciri competed with neighboring Goths, Gepids, Suebi and others for supremacy over the region. Three graves at Bakodpuszta in Hungary has been identified with the Sciri. In the nearby Sarviz marshes a magnificent treasure has been discovered, and this treasure has been linked to Edeko.

Jordanes reports that the Sciri were allies of the Ostrogoths, but were encouraged by Hunimund of the Suebi to break off this alliance. In the 460s AD, both the Sciri and the Ostrogoths sought an alliance with the Eastern Roman Empire. Against the advice of his general Aspar, Emperor Leo I decided to help the Sciri. In 468/469 AD the Sciri made a surprise attack on the Ostrogoths. Although the Ostrogothic king Valamir was killed in this conflict, the Sciri were defeated. Valamir was succeeded as king by Theodemir, who subsequently went on the offensive against the Sciri, who in turn received support from the Suebi, Heruli and Sarmatians. In the Battle of Bolia, the Ostrogoths defeated a coalition of Roman-supported peoples, including Sciri, Heruli, Suebi, Sarmatians, Gepids and Rugii. Jordanes reports that the Sciri were dealt a severe blow in their conflict with the Ostrogoths.

===Later history===

After the destruction of the Scirian kingdom, Odoacer led most of the surviving Sciri, in addition to many Heruli and Rugii, into Italy to join the Roman army, which was controlled by Ricimer. Turcilingi are also reported as having been part of this group. Jordanes calls Odoacer king of the Turcilingi, and they have been interpreted as another East Germanic tribe and/or perhaps the royal family of the Sciri. Odoacer&#x27;s brother Onoulphus went to Constantinople with other Sciri. Odoacer&#x27;s group might have numbered 10,000 warriors, and came to play a prominent role in the Roman army and Roman politics. They were utilized by Ricimer in his conflict with Anthemius.

In 476 AD, Odoacer led an uprising among the barbarian troops against Romulus Augustulus and the latter&#x27;s father Orestes. Odoacer then declared himself king of Italy, thus ending the Western Roman Empire. He subsequently gained control over all of Italy. It is possible that Odoacer&#x27;s uprising was organized in coordination with his brother Onoulphus in Constantinople. In 486 Onoulphus fell out of favor with Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, and moved to Ravenna with his Scirian followers to join Odoacer. Soon afterwards, Zeno encouraged Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, to invade Italy. After a bloody conflict, Theodoric emerged victorious. On March 15, 493, Theodoric murdered Odoacer with his own hands and established the Ostrogothic Kingdom. By this time the Sciri disappear from history.

Remaining elements of the Sciri might have settled in modern-day Bavaria. Along with the Heruli and Rugii, the Sciri may have been one of the tribes which contributed to the formation of the Bavarii. Since the 19th century, the name of the Sciri has been detected in Bavarian placenames. Wolfgang Haubrichs gives examples such as Scheyern (first attested as &quot;Scira&quot; in 1080), Scheuer (&quot;Sciri&quot;, c. 975), Scheuern in Neubeuern (&quot;Skira&quot;, 11th century) and perhaps Scheuring (&quot;Sciringen&quot;, 1150). These names are believed to designate these villages as Scirian, and it is proposed that the Sciri probably mediated the transfer of a few East Germanic lexical items to the Bavarian language, which otherwise shows no East Germanic influence.

==Culture==
Historians Reinhard Wenskus and Herwig Wolfram believe that Sciri prided themselves on their unmixed ancestry, and did not allow intermarriage, and that similar practices were followed by other Germanic peoples such as the Rugii and Juthungi.

<text>Professor John Norman Collie FRSE FRS (10 September 1859 – 1 November 1942), commonly referred to as J. Norman Collie, was an English scientist, mountaineer and explorer.

== Life and work ==

He was born in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the second of four sons to John Collie and Selina Mary Winkworth. Collie&#x27;s aunts, from his mothers side, were Susanna and Catherine Winkworth.

In 1870 the family moved to Clifton, near Bristol, and John was educated initially at Windlesham in Surrey and then in 1873 at Charterhouse School. The family money had been made in the cotton trade, but in 1875 the American Civil War resulted in their financial ruin when their American stock was burnt. Collie had to leave Charterhouse and transfer to Clifton College, Bristol where he realised he was completely unsuited for the classics. He attended University College in Bristol and developed an interest in chemistry.

He earned a PhD in chemistry under Johannes Wislicenus at Würzburg in 1884. Returning to Britain, he taught three years at Cheltenham Ladies College where, according to his niece, &quot;he was far from being a ladies&#x27; man and probably found that schoolgirls in bulk were rather more than he could stomach&quot;. He left to join University College London (UCL) as an assistant to William Ramsay. His early work was the study of phosphonium and phosphine derivatives and allied ammonium compounds. Later he made important contributions to the knowledge of dehydroacetic acid (then called dehydracetic acid), describing a number of very remarkable &#x27;condensations,&#x27; whereby it is converted into pyridine, orcinol and naphthalene derivatives.

Collie served as Professor of Organic Chemistry at UCL from 1896 to 1913, and headed its chemistry department from 1913 to 1928. He performed important research that led to the taking of the first x-ray for diagnosing medical conditions. According to Bentley, Collie &quot;worked with Ramsay on the inert gases, constructed the first neon lamp, proposed a dynamic structure for benzene, and discovered the first oxonium salt.&quot; The work on neon discharge lamps was conducted in 1909. The effect of glowing neon in contact with mercury was later sometimes called the Collier effect.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1888. His proposers included Alexander Crum Brown and Edmund Albert Letts. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1896.

==Mountaineering==

Collie&#x27;s professional career was spent as a scientist but his avocation was mountaineering. Among mountaineers, he is perhaps best remembered for his pioneering climbs on the Cuillin in the Isle of Skye, but he also climbed in the English Lake District and in the Alps with William Cecil Slingsby, Geoffrey Hastings and Albert F. Mummery.

There are alpine connections in Collie&#x27;s family, his aunt was elected to the Alpine Club in 1861, and his uncle, Stephen Winkworth (1831-1886), was with his wife, Emma (née Thomasson) when she made the first female ascents of the Jungfrau, Alphubel and Aletschhorn in 1863. However, Collie himself appears to have begun climbing in Skye in 1886. He went there with his brothers to fish but made an ascent of Sgùrr nan Gillean. After two unsuccessful attempts he was given advice on the route by John Mackenzie, a Skye crofter and Britain&#x27;s first professional mountain guide. Collie returned regularly to Skye and climbed with MacKenzie, the two men becoming firm friends and making many first ascents.

In 1899 he discovered the Cioch, a unique rock feature on the Coire Lagan face of Sron na Ciche. This he climbed in 1906 with Mackenzie, who named it from the Gaelic word for a breast. Collie was instrumental in producing much better maps of the Cuillin which had previously defied the skills of cartographers. He is commemorated in the Cuillin by Sgúrr Thormaid (Norman&#x27;s Peak; pronounced Skoor Horamitch) He is also remembered in &quot;Collie&#x27;s Ledge&quot;, a famously exposed rocky scramble across the west face of Sgùrr Mhic Choinnich, (MacKenzie&#x27;s Peak) which is named after his great friend. Since the first traverse of this ledge was made by MacKenzie with the Irish climber, Henry Hart, rather than Collie himself, some authoritative publications have begun to use the name &quot;Hart&#x27;s Ledge&quot;
In the 1997 BBC TV series on Scottish climbing, &quot;The Edge&quot;, Collie and MacKenzie&#x27;s exploits were re-enacted by Alan Kimber (Collie) and John Lyall (MacKenzie).

Collie also made significant ascents on mainland Scotland, notably the first ascent and first winter ascent of Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis with Godfrey Solly and J. Collier on 29 March 1894. The ridge had one previous descent by the Hopkinsons in 1892. In 1894 he also climbed the eponymous Collie&#x27;s Pinnacle on Bidean nam Bian, Argyll&#x27;s highest hill, by its short side. (10 metres, grade Easy)

In 1895, Collie, Mummery, and fellow climber Geoffrey Hastings went to the Himalaya Range for the world&#x27;s first attempt at a Himalayan 8,000-metre peak, Nanga Parbat. They were years ahead of their time, and the mountain claimed the first of its many victims: Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir and Goman Singh were killed by an avalanche and never seen again. The story of this disastrous expedition is told in Collie&#x27;s book, &quot;From the Himalaya to Skye&quot;.

After gaining climbing experience on the Alps, the Caucasus and the Himalaya, in 1897 Collie joined the Appalachian Club upon the invitation of Charles Fay, and spent the summer climbing in the Canadian Rockies. From 1898 to 1911, Collie visited the Canadian Rockies five more times, accomplishing twenty-one first ascents and naming more than thirty peaks. He was particularly interested in locating and climbing the mythical giants of Hooker and Brown which had bordered the forgotten fur trade route through the Rockies and were reputed to be over 16,000 feet high. In 1903, Collie and Hugh Stutfield published an authoritative book on the region, &quot;Climbs and Explorations in the Canadian Rockies&quot;.

==Death==
Collie retired in 1929 and thereafter spent his summers in Skye. He died at Sligachan in November 1942 from pneumonia, after falling into Loch Leathan below the Storr a year earlier whilst fishing. In keeping with his wishes, he was interred next to his friend, John MacKenzie, in an old graveyard at Struan by Bracadale next to Loch Harport.

==Influence==

In a book published in 2013 it is suggested that Collie may have inspired Conan Doyle with some characteristics for Sherlock Holmes. Apart from his mountaineering skills Collie was a confirmed bachelor sharing his house with a solicitor. With an analytical mind honed by chemical research he had wide interests ranging from Chinese porcelain to fishing and from claret to horse racing. In addition he was an incessant pipe smoker only lighting a cigarette when refilling his pipe.

== Honours and affiliations ==
* Fellow of the Royal Society (1896)
* Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (1897)
* President of the Alpine Club (1920–22)
* Member of the Mount Everest Committee (1921)
* Mount Collie in Yoho National Park and Sgurr Thormaid (Norman&#x27;s Peak) on the Isle of Skye were both named after Norman Collie.

==Memorial==
A ten-year project raised funding to erect a bronze statue and memorial to John MacKenzie and Norman Collie on Skye. The bronze was designed by local sculptor, Stephen Tinney. It was unveiled on a rocky knoll opposite the Sligachan Hotel, overlooking the Cuillin Hills, in September 2020.

<text>Janus Films is an American film distribution company. The distributor is credited with introducing numerous films, now considered masterpieces of world cinema, to American audiences, including the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, Sergei Eisenstein, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray, François Truffaut, Yasujirō Ozu and many other well-regarded directors. Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957) was the film responsible for the company&#x27;s initial growth.

Janus has a close business relationship with The Criterion Collection regarding the release of its films on DVD and Blu-ray and is still an active theatrical distributor.

The company&#x27;s name and logo come from Janus, the two-faced Roman god of transitions, passages, beginnings, and endings.

==History==
Janus Films was founded in 1956 by Bryant Haliday and Cyrus Harvey, Jr., in the historic Brattle Theater, a Harvard Square landmark in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Prior to the conception of Janus, Haliday and Harvey began screening both foreign and American films at the Brattle Theater and proceeded to regularly fill the 300-seat venue. Having purchased the theater, Haliday, together with Harvey, converted the Brattle into a popular movie house for the showing of art films.

Perceiving potential success in the film business, Haliday and Harvey moved into the New York City market and began running the 55th Street Playhouse. Janus Films was subsequently launched in March 1956 and the Playhouse was used as the primary location for exhibiting Janus-distributed films. The two owners eventually sold Janus Films in 1965 following a decline in the American art film market, and in 1966 Haliday also sold the Brattle, while Harvey continued to manage the theater into the 1970s.

In 1977, Kino International (now Kino Lorber) acquired rights to the company&#x27;s film collection, which became the foundation for Kino&#x27;s international library of films. 

Janus was later acquired by Saul J. Turell and William J. Becker. Janus Films, including The Criterion Collection, were sold to Steven Rales in May 2024 in a private acquisition.

==Recent releases==
On October 24, 2006, in celebration of 50 years of business, the Criterion Collection released 50 of the films that Janus distributed in a large boxset containing 50 DVDs and a 200-page essay on the history of art house films. The package was called &quot;Essential Art House: 50 Years of Janus Films&quot;. A.O. Scott chose the set as his DVD pick when he co-hosted &quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;. As part of its 44th Festival in 2006, the New York Film Festival presented a series called &quot;50 Years of Janus Films&quot;, a tribute to the company.

In 2009, Janus Films released &quot;Revanche&quot;, its first first-run theatrical release in 30 years. Since then, with their distribution partner, Sideshow, Janus Films had released more recent films such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;EO&quot;.

Then, in 2010, Janus acquired domestic theatrical and home video rights to the Charlie Chaplin library under license from the Chaplin estate and worldwide distribution agent MK2. The Criterion division handles the Chaplin library for re-issue on DVD and Blu-ray, in addition to theatrical release.

In 2024, Janus distributed the Latvian animated film, Flow, by Director Glints Zilbalodis about the story of a black cat as a protagonist in a post-apocalyptic world which has to navigate the flooded environment alongside a dog, capybara, ring-tailed lemur, and a secretary bird. The entire film has no dialogue, but uses a combination of animal sounds and environment noises to engage the audience. Flow has become the all-time highest-grossing release for Janus. 

Janus also currently manages part of the Caidin Film Company library for Westchester Films, and the Faces Distribution/John Cassavetes library for Jumer Productions, both companies&#x27; successors-in-interest to Castle Hill Productions.

<text>James Dixon Barnes ( Swan; born 28 April 1956) is a Scottish-born Australian rock singer. His career, both as a solo performer and as the lead vocalist with the rock band Cold Chisel, has made him one of the most popular and best-selling Australian music artists of all time. By 2022 he had achieved 15 solo number-one albums in Australia, more than any other artist. He has won many awards, and been nominated for many more. In 2005 he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame as a solo artist, after also having been an inductee in 1992 as a member of Cold Chisel. His music has covered many genres, including hard rock, blues rock, soul, R&amp;B, country, country rock, and electronic. Some of his albums were recorded at his own recording studio, Freight Train Studios.

Several of his children are musicians who have on occasion joined him on stage, including drummer Jackie, his sisters Mahalia, Eliza-Jane (&quot;EJ&quot;), and Elly-May, and elder half-brother David Campbell. His wife Jane formed the Jane Barnes Band in the family home during the COVID-19 lockdowns, which in 2023 toured Australia.

Barnes&#x27; first memoir, which told of his poverty-stricken and traumatic childhood years, &quot;Working Class Boy&quot; (2016), was followed by a sequel published the following year, &quot;Working Class Man&quot;. For these, he won the Biography of the Year award at the Australian Book Industry Awards for two consecutive years.

==Early life and education==
Barnes was born James Dixon Swan in in Dennistoun, Glasgow, to Dorothy and James Ruthven Harvey Swan. He has four siblings: John, Dorothy, Linda, and Alan. His maternal grandmother was Jewish, but he was raised Protestant and later became a Buddhist. Barnes has said that he recalls living in the slums of Glasgow &quot;vividly&quot;.

The family, including parents and four siblings John, Dorothy, Linda, and Alan, emigrated on 7 December 1961 under the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, arriving in Australia when he was five years old, on 21 January 1962. Another sister, Lisa, was born later that year. They originally lived in Adelaide, though they eventually settled in the satellite town (now regarded as a suburb) of Elizabeth. Jimmy&#x27;s older brother John became a successful musician as founder and lead singer of the rock band Swanee. John encouraged and taught Barnes how to sing, as he was not initially interested.

Barnes&#x27; father was an alcoholic, and the children endured violence, abuse, and trauma growing up. After his parents divorced, his mother remarried, to Reg Barnes. Jimmy adopted the name James Dixon Barnes after his stepfather, as did all of the other siblings except for the eldest, John. John Dixon became the target of sexual abuse from his parents&#x27; friends&#x27; son, and left home at 13, but Barnes has said that he was one of two heroes (the other being Reg); that he &quot;would have been killed if it weren&#x27;t for him&quot;. Barnes later said &quot;Jim Swan was my father, but Reg Barnes was my dad&quot;. He has expressed anger towards his mother, who deserted the family, leaving Reg to bring up the children.

==Cold Chisel==
Barnes took up an apprenticeship in a foundry with the South Australian Railways in 1973, but the love he and his brother had for music led him to join a band. In 1974, his brother Swanee was playing drums with Fraternity, which had just parted ways with the singer Bon Scott. Barnes took over the role but his tenure with the band was brief and, in December 1975, he joined a harder-edged band called Orange, with the organist and songwriter Don Walker, guitarist Ian Moss, drummer Steve Prestwich, and bass guitarist Les Kaczmarek. He later said that Walker had had a profound influence on him, because &quot;he was someone who really cared about what he was doing, and who seemed to have a plan&quot;.

In 1974, Orange had changed its name to Cold Chisel and began to develop a strong presence on the local music scene. Barnes moved to Armidale, New South Wales with the band while Walker completed his masters there, In May 1976 Cold Chisel relocated to Melbourne, but, &quot;frustrated by their lack of progress&quot;, they moved on to Sydney in early 1977. In late 1977 WEA (later Warner Music) signed the band.

Between 1978 and 1984, Cold Chisel released five studio albums and won numerous &quot;TV Week&quot; / &quot;Countdown&quot; Awards. Barnes would frequently leave and return to the band during this period, and they did not earn enough money to live on, despite pulling huge crowds. After acrimonious arguments had developed among band members, Cold Chisel broke up in December 1983, its final performances at the Sydney Entertainment Centre running from 12 to 15 December 1983.

Cold Chisel reunited in 1997 and released &quot;Last Wave of Summer&quot; in 1998. Since then Barnes has continued to perform on and off with the band while also pursuing a solo career. In 2013 they established their own record label under which to publish their own music, and signed a deal for distribution and promotion with the Universal Music Group. In late 2024 the band did a 50th anniversary national tour, finishing with a gig at the VAILO Adelaide 500 post-race concert in Adelaide on 17 November 2024.

==Solo career==
===1980s===
Barnes launched his solo career less than a month after Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;Last Stand&quot; tour came to an end in December 1983. He assembled a band that included Arnott, the former Fraternity bass guitar player Bruce Howe and guitarists Mal Eastick (ex-Stars) and Chris Stockley (ex-The Dingoes) and began touring and writing for a solo album. Signing to Mushroom Records, Barnes released his first single, &quot;No Second Prize&quot;, in August 1984, which peaked at number 12 on the Australian charts. His first solo album, &quot;Bodyswerve&quot;, was produced by Mark Opitz and released in 1984. It debuted at Number One on the Australian charts.

Barnes&#x27;s second album, &quot;For the Working Class Man&quot;, was released in December 1985 and included the tracks &quot;I&#x27;d Die to Be with You Tonight&quot; and &quot;Working Class Man&quot;. &quot;For the Working Class Man&quot; debuted on the Australian national chart at No. 1 in December 1985 and it remained at No. 1 for seven weeks. Titled simply &quot;Jimmy Barnes&quot; in the US, the album was issued in February 1986 to tie in with the release of the Ron Howard film &quot;Gung Ho&quot; (titled &quot;Working Class Man&quot; in Australia), which used &quot;Working Class Man&quot;.

The Jimmy Barnes band that toured Australia in support of the album included Howe and Arnott, with the keyboard player Peter Kekell, the former Rose Tattoo guitarist Robin Riley and the American guitarist Dave Amato. With the release of the album in America, Barnes and a band of Canadian musicians hand-picked by his North American management team toured with ZZ Top.

In 1986, Barnes recorded two songs with INXS, a cover version of the Easybeats&#x27; &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Laying Down The Law&quot;, which he co-wrote with INXS members Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence. Both songs appeared on soundtrack of the Joel Schumacher film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987). &quot;Good Times&quot; was also used as the theme song for the Australian Made series of concerts that toured the country in the summer of 1986–87. Barnes and INXS headlined, and the rest of the line-up was Mental as Anything, Divinyls, Models, The Saints, I&#x27;m Talking, and The Triffids. A concert film of this event was made by Richard Lowenstein and released later that year.

In October 1987, Barnes released &quot;Too Much Ain&#x27;t Enough Love&quot;, which became his first solo number-one single. His third album, &quot;Freight Train Heart&quot;, was released in December 1987 and peaked at number one. &quot;Freight Train Heart&quot; had moderate success outside Australia.

In November 1988, Barnes released his first solo live album, &quot;Barnestorming&quot;, which became his fourth solo number one album. A version of the Percy Sledge standard &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; released from the album peaked at number 3.

===1990s===
In 1990, Barnes recorded his fourth studio album, which featured songwriting contributions from the likes of Desmond Child, Diane Warren and Holly Knight. &quot;Two Fires&quot;, released in August 1990. debuted at number one on the Australian chart. The album featured the top-twenty singles &quot;Lay Down Your Guns&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make it Last All Night&quot; and &quot;When Your Love is Gone&quot;.

In November 1991, Barnes released his fifth studio album, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, an album of soul covers. Barnes had long fostered a love for soul and for black music, naming his children after influential black artists and including songs by Sam Cooke and Percy Sledge on previous albums. &quot;Soul Deep&quot; became Barnes&#x27;s sixth Australian number-one album and included the track &quot;When Something Is Wrong with My Baby&quot; with John Farnham.

In March 1993, Barnes released &quot;Heat&quot;, which was influenced by the then-current grunge trend and by the music of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. &quot;Heat&quot; peaked at number two on the ARIA charts, becoming Barnes&#x27;s first solo album not to peak at number one. The album contained the song &quot;Stone Cold&quot;, written by former Cold Chisel bandmate Don Walker. It marked the first time Jimmy Barnes had worked with any member of his old band for almost a decade. The pair teamed up for an acoustic version of the track for an unplugged album &quot;Flesh and Wood&quot;, which was released in December 1993 and peaked at number two. The album included a version, recorded with The Badloves, of The Band&#x27;s &quot;The Weight&quot;, which became a top-ten hit. Also in 1993, Barnes teamed up with Tina Turner for a duet version of &quot;The Best&quot; in the form of a TV promotion for rugby league&#x27;s Winfield Cup. The single also reached the top ten in 1993.

In the mid-1990s, Barnes&#x27;s career suffered a slump. He faced financial ruin as his music-publishing company Dirty Sheet Music and his wife&#x27;s children&#x27;s fashion label both went broke. The family sold their property in Bowral, in the Southern Highlands of NSW, and settled for some time in Aix-en-Provence, France, attracting some adverse publicity when Barnes assaulted a television crew from Channel 7. While there, Barnes did considerable live work throughout Britain and toured with the Rolling Stones.

In June 1995, Barnes released his eighth studio album, &quot;Psyclone&quot;, which peaked at number 2 in Australia and featured the top-twenty single &quot;Change of Heart&quot;.

In September 1996, Barnes released &quot;Lover Lover&quot;, which peaked at number 6 on the singles chart. This was followed in October 1996 with Barnes&#x27;s first greatest-hits compilation, &quot;Barnes Hits Anthology&quot;, which became Barnes&#x27;s seventh solo number-one album.

In 1998, Cold Chisel reformed and Barnes returned to Australia with his family after three years in France. In March 1999 Barnes performed the 1978 Sylvester hit &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; live onstage at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras annual party.

Later that year Barnes released the heavy-rock single &quot;Love and Hate&quot;, followed by its parent album &quot;Love and Fear&quot;. An autobiographical record combining hard rock with electronic music, &quot;Love and Fear&quot; was Barnes&#x27;s first album to miss the Australian top ten, peaking at number 22.

===2000s===

In October 2000, Barnes performed at the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. In November 2000, Barnes released a second album of soul tunes, titled &quot;Soul Deeper... Songs From the Deep South&quot;. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA charts. A number of live albums followed with little commercial success.

In 2004, Barnes recorded an album with Deep Purple guitarist Steve Morse, Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake, bass player Bob Daisley and keyboard player Don Airey under the name &quot;Living Loud&quot;. The self-titled album featured a number of songs originally written and recorded with Ozzy Osbourne by Kerslake, Daisley, and Airey.

In July 2005, Barnes released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Double Happiness&quot;, which debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Double Happiness&quot; was an album of duets, including several with his children, daughters Mahalia and Elly-May, sons Jackie Barnes and David Campbell. After its initial success, it was re-released as a double CD/DVD package featuring many of his duets from previous albums, including those with INXS, John Farnham, Joe Cocker, and Tina Turner.

In September 2007 he started recording his twelfth studio album, &quot;Out in the Blue&quot;. Produced by Nash Chambers at Barnes&#x27; own studio Freight Train Studios, it was released on 24 November 2007. The songs were written while he recovered from his heart surgery, and was described as a change in direction, &quot;very much a rootsy, rock album with rockabilly shuffles, powerful ballads and flat chat rock &amp; roll&quot;. &quot;When Two Hearts Collide&quot; is a duet with Kasey Chambers, and other musicians featured on the album include Jim Moginie (Midnight Oil), Mark Punch, and Chris Haigh, as well as his four children Mahalia, EJ, Jackie, and Elly-May.
In March 2008, Barnes appeared as a special guest during soul singer Guy Sebastian&#x27;s tour.

November 2008 saw the release of a duet with son David Campbell, a cover of The Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feeling&quot; that featured on Campbell&#x27;s album &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

In September 2009, Barnes released his thirteenth studio album &quot;The Rhythm and the Blues&quot; which became Barnes&#x27;s ninth Australian number one album; thus giving him more No. 1 albums than any other Australian artist.

===2010s===

In August 2010, Barnes released his 14th solo studio album, &quot;Rage and Ruin&quot;. Barnes stated that the ideas for most of the lyrics and song themes came from a journal he kept during a period in his life (late 1990s to early 2000s) when he struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. &quot;Rage and Ruin&quot; debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Charts on 5 September 2010.

Barnes headlined at Celebrate in the Park, playing a 90-minute set which included his solo hits and some Cold Chisel greats. He was joined by daughter Mahalia in a soulful rendition of &quot;When the War Is Over&quot;, which he dedicated to the memory of Steve Prestwich.

In August 2014, Barnes released &quot;30:30 Hindsight&quot;, an anniversary album celebrating 30 years since his chart-topping debut solo album, &quot;Bodyswerve&quot;. The album debuted at No. 1 in Australia, becoming Barnes&#x27;s 10th solo No. 1 album.

In 2015, Barnes asked the Reclaim Australia Political Party to stop playing his music at their rallies. In July 2015, it was announced that Barnes would release &quot;Best of the Soul Years&quot; compilation. The album would be compiled of soul and R&amp;B classics, from his three soul albums; &quot;Soul Deep&quot; (1991), &quot;Soul Deeper&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Rhythm and the Blues&quot; (2009). A fourth album of soul covers was released in June 2016 called, &quot;Soul Searchin&#x27;&quot;, which became Barnes&#x27;s 11th number one album in Australia and tied Barnes the equal second-most (with Madonna and U2) of all time behind The Beatles at 14.

In 2017, he featured in the song &quot;Big Enough&quot; by Kirin J. Callinan, alongside Alex Cameron and Molly Lewis. The song was featured on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; in a comedic skit. In addition to this, his cameo in the song&#x27;s music video became a popular internet meme in late 2017. In March of the same year, Barnes released a children&#x27;s album called &quot;Och Aye the G&#x27;nu&quot;. It won the ARIA Award for Best Children&#x27;s Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2017, although the brand that appeared on the album, as well as the poetry books that were released on the first of April are related to The Wiggles.

In January 2019, Barnes announced his forthcoming eighteenth solo studio album, &quot;My Criminal Record&quot;. It was released on 17 May 2019. It was Barnes&#x27;s 12th solo number-one album, and 16th when including releases with Cold Chisel on the Australian albums chart, making him the artist with the most chart-topping albums in Australian chart history, having previously tied at 11 number ones with Madonna and U2. At the APRA Music Awards of 2020, &quot;Shutting Down Our Town&quot; was nominated for Most Performed Rock Work of the Year.

===2020s===
In 2021, Barnes stated that he formed a rockabilly band with Slim Jim Phantom and Chris Cheney.

In April 2022, Barnes announced the forthcoming release of &quot;Soul Deep 30&quot;, celebrating the 30th anniversary of &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, alongside a national tour. In November 2022, Barnes released his first Christmas album, &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;. It became his fifteenth number-one solo album.

In March 2023, Barnes announced the formation of supergroup The Barnestormers, featuring Barnes, Chris Cheney, Slim Jim Phantom, Jools Holland and Kevin Shirley. A self-titled album was released on 26 May 2023.

==Freight Train Studios==
Barnes&#x27; Freight Train Studios were originally located at Bowral, later moving to Botany in Sydney.

Among others, the following albums were recorded in the studio:
*&quot;Hey Rudolph!&quot; (The Tin Lids, 2006); a collection of Christmas carols 
*&quot;Out in the Blue&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Rage and Ruin&quot; (also at Conway Recording Studio A, Los Angeles, and Woodcliff Studios, Sherman Oaks (LA)

==Other activities==
In 1992 Barnes worked with his friend Mandawuy Yunupingu, frontman of Yothu Yindi, on a project called &quot;Sister Schools&quot;, the aim of which was to ensure that &quot;schools with few or no Aboriginal children will forge educational and social links with schools with large numbers of Aboriginal children, in an attempt to foster tolerance and understanding&quot;. Before the launch of the project, &quot;the Yunupingu kids&quot; (Mandawuy&#x27;s children) recorded a song written by Yunupingu called &quot;School&quot; with Barnes&#x27; children in their band The Tin Lids. As part of the project, endorsed by the government, schools with few or no Aboriginal children would forge educational and social links with schools with many Aboriginal children, by exchanging letters, photographs, and other media. Around 100 schools expressed interest in the project, which was launched in August 1992 by connecting the school in Yirrkala with Gib Gate Primary School near Mittagong in New South Wales. In 1994, a primary school in Deloraine, Tasmania, hosted a group of children from Ali Curung, NT, for six days as part of the scheme.

In late 2006, Barnes became patron of the Choir of Hard Knocks, a choral group formed by Jonathon Welch and consisting of homeless and disadvantaged people in Melbourne. The formation of the choir was documented by the ABC as a five-part series aired in May 2007. Barnes has regularly performed &quot;Flame Trees&quot; with the choir at their concerts.

On 14 March 2011 he planted a flame tree, made famous in Cold Chisel&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Flame Trees&quot;, at the National Arboretum Canberra.

Barnes also guest-starred in episode 2 of season 2 of the television comedy series &quot;These New South Whales&quot; in 2018.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In November 1979, Barnes met Jane Mahoney, the stepdaughter of an Australian diplomat whose mother was Thai. Mahoney had spent the first five years of her life living with extended family in a family compound in Bangkok. Her mother, Phorn, was one of 26 children, and her grandmother was one of seven wives. Her grandfather was a rich businessman who had left two Chinese wives behind when he moved from China to Thailand just before the Communist Revolution of China. Phorn was sent to boarding school in England. She met and married Thai man Suvit Dejakasaya, and the couple had three children before divorcing four years later. Soon afterwards, Phorn met and married Australian diplomat John Mahoney, and moved to Canberra with him. The family moved around following her father&#x27;s postings, living in Italy, Russia, New Guinea, Kiribati, Malta, and Malaysia. Jane studied pure mathematics, comparative religion, art history, psychology, and five languages at The University of Canberra, and met Barnes in November 1979. Eventually, she dropped out of university and moved to Sydney to be with him, and they married in May 1981.

Barnes has eight children: four with his wife Jane (Mahalia, Eliza-Jane (&quot;EJ&quot;), Jackie and Elly-Mayall musically known as The Tin Lids). Before that, his eldest son, David Campbell, was born of a teenage relationship with Kim Campbell. He has said about his relationship with David&#x27;s mother Kim that they were just two scared kids who were being beaten and abused at home, and not ready to bring up a child. David&#x27;s grandmother raised him, although Barnes was at first told that he had been adopted. He also has three daughters (Amanda, Megan, and Katy Lee) from three other relationships. In 2010, he met Amanda (then 37) and Megan (then 36) for the first time, and accepted them into his family as soon as paternity had been confirmed. He met Katy Lee Carroll around 2019, publishing a post about her on social media for the first time in December 2024. She has got to know the rest of the family since, and posted about it herself. While requesting privacy, she also acknowledged that she had &quot;been embraced by the Barnes family with love, warmth and incredible understanding&quot;.

Barnes is brother-in-law to fellow musician and long-time collaborator Diesel, who married Jane Barnes&#x27;s sister Jep in 1989.

After Barnes played in Darwin in 1991 and met Mandawuy Yunupingu, frontman of Yothu Yindi, Barnes was &quot;adopted&quot; as a white brother into the Yunupingu clan, based on the Gove Peninsula in east Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.

===Jane Barnes Band===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, with social distancing and lockdowns enforced to prevent the spread of the disease, Jane Barnes learned how to play the guitar and she and Jimmy, sometimes along with various family members, started the Jane Barnes Band, performing in their lounge room and sharing videos on social media. They proved so popular that the band, later joined by other musicians, went on tour in 2023, and also appeared on &quot;Sunrise&quot; on Channel 7. Jane sang and as well as playing guitar, played bagpipes and tin flute,

===Health===
By around the 2000s, both Jane and Jimmy Barnes were not coping, and addicted to alcohol and drugs. Their children, then in their late teens and early twenties, staged an intervention which led their parents to going into rehab and kicking their habits.

Barnes underwent heart surgery in February 2007. On 7 July 2007 Barnes was a presenter at the Australian leg of Live Earth. In August he became a regular presenter on &quot;The Know&quot;, a pop culture program on the pay-TV channel MAX and has also been a presenter of the &quot;Planet Rock&quot; program on the Austereo network. 

On 28 November 2023, Barnes announced via Instagram that he was being treated in hospital for a bacterial infection. He remained in hospital for two weeks; on 12 December he announced, also via Instagram, that he was undergoing open heart surgery due to the infection having spread to an already-weakened valve.

===Autobiographies===
In 2016, Barnes published his autobiography, &quot;Working Class Boy&quot;, which explored his traumatic childhood experiences.

In November 2017, Barnes published a second memoir; a sequel to &quot;Working Class Boy&quot; titled &quot;Working Class Man&quot;. On 3 May 2018, Barnes won the biography of the year award at the Australian Book Industry Awards for the second year in a row.

His autobiography &quot;Working Class Boy&quot; was adapted into a film by Universal Pictures. Directed by Mark Joffe, the film premiered in Australian cinemas on 23 August 2018. A soundtrack was released on 17 August 2018.

===Beliefs and politics===
Barnes is a practising Buddhist, and describes himself as a socialist. He is a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, as well as the Port Adelaide Football Club.

<text>A classifier (abbreviated &#x27; or &#x27;) is a word or affix that accompanies nouns and can be considered to &quot;classify&quot; a noun depending on some characteristics (e.g. humanness, animacy, sex, shape, social status) of its referent. Classifiers in this sense are specifically called noun classifiers because some languages in Papua as well as the Americas have verbal classifiers which categorize the referent of its argument.

In languages that have classifiers, they are often used when the noun is being counted, that is, when it appears with a numeral. In such languages, a phrase such as &quot;three people&quot; is often required to be expressed as &quot;three &quot;X&quot; (of) people&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a classifier appropriate to the noun for &quot;people&quot;; compare to &quot;three blades of grass&quot;. Classifiers that appear next to a numeral or a quantifier are particularly called numeral classifiers. They play an important role in certain languages, especially East and Southeast Asian languages, including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese. 

Numeral classifiers may have other functions too; in Chinese, they are commonly used when a noun is preceded by a demonstrative (word meaning &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;). Some Asian languages like Zhuang, Hmong and Cantonese use &quot;bare classifier construction&quot; where a classifier is attached without numerals to a noun for definite reference; the latter two languages also extend numeral classifiers to the possessive classifier construction where they behave as a possessive marker connecting a noun to another noun that denotes the possessor.

Possessive classifiers are usually used in accord with semantic characteristics of the possessed noun and less commonly with the relation between the possessed and the possessor although possessor classifiers are reported in a few languages (e.g. Dâw).

Classifiers are absent or marginal in European languages. An example of a possible classifier in English is &quot;piece&quot; in phrases like &quot;three pieces of paper&quot;. In American Sign Language, particular classifier handshapes represent a noun&#x27;s orientation in space.

There are similarities between classifier systems and noun classes, although there are also significant differences. While noun classes are defined in terms of agreement, classifiers do not alter the form of other elements in a clause. Also, languages with classifiers may have hundreds of classifiers whereas languages with noun classes (or in particular, genders) tend to have a smaller number of classifiers. Noun classes are not always dependent on the nouns&#x27; meaning but they have a variety of grammatical consequences.

==Overview==
A classifier is a word (or in some analyses, a bound morpheme) which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts, and generally reflects some kind of conceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents. Thus a language might have one classifier for nouns representing persons, another for nouns representing flat objects, another for nouns denoting periods of time, and so on. The assignment of classifier to noun may also be to some degree unpredictable, with certain nouns taking certain classifiers by historically established convention.

The situations in which classifiers may or must appear depend on the grammar of the language in question, but they are frequently required when a noun is accompanied by a numeral. They are therefore sometimes known (particularly in the context of languages such as Japanese) as counter words. They may also be used when a noun is accompanied by a demonstrative (a word such as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;).

The following examples, from Standard Mandarin Chinese, illustrate the use of classifiers with a numeral. The classifiers used here are 位 (pinyin &quot;wèi&quot;), used (among other things) with nouns for humans; 棵 &quot;kē&quot;, used with nouns for trees; 只/隻 (&quot;zhī&quot;), used with nouns for certain animals, including birds; and 条/條 (&quot;tiáo&quot;), used with nouns for certain long flexible objects. (Plurals of Chinese nouns are not normally marked in any way; the same form of the noun is used for both singular and plural.)


个 (個) &quot;gè&quot;, is also often used in informal speech as a general classifier, with almost any noun, taking the place of more specific classifiers.

The noun in such phrases may be omitted, if the classifier alone (and the context) is sufficient to indicate what noun is intended. For example, in answering a question:

Languages which make systematic use of (noun) classifiers include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian languages, Bengali, Assamese, Persian, Austronesian languages, Mayan languages and others. A less typical example of classifiers is those used with the verb. Verbal classifiers are found in languages like Southern Athabaskan.

Classifier handshapes are also found in sign languages, although these have a somewhat different grammatical function.

Classifiers are often derived from nouns (or occasionally other parts of speech), which have become specialized as classifiers, or may retain other uses besides their use as classifiers. Classifiers, like other words, are sometimes borrowed from other languages. A language may be said to have dozens or even hundreds of different classifiers. However, such enumerations often also include measure words.

===Classifiers versus measure words===
Measure words play a similar role to classifiers, except that they denote a particular quantity of something (a drop, a cupful, a pint, etc.), rather than the inherent countable units associated with a count noun. Classifiers are used with count nouns; measure words can be used with mass nouns (e.g. &quot;two pints of mud&quot;), and can also be used when a count noun&#x27;s quantity is not described in terms of its inherent countable units (e.g. &quot;two pints of acorns&quot;).

However, the terminological distinction between classifiers and measure words is often blurred – classifiers are commonly referred to as measure words in some contexts, such as Chinese language teaching, and measure words are sometimes called &quot;mass-classifiers&quot; or similar.

==Examples by language==

===European languages===
Classifiers are not generally a feature of English or other European languages, although classifier-like constructions are found with certain nouns. A commonly cited English example is the word &quot;head&quot; in phrases such as &quot;five head of cattle&quot;: the word &quot;cattle&quot; (for some speakers) is an uncountable (mass) noun, and requires the word &quot;head&quot; to enable its units to be counted. The parallel construction exists in French: &quot;une tête de bétail&quot; (&quot;one head of cattle&quot;), in Spanish: &quot;una cabeza de ganado&quot; (&quot;one head of cattle&quot;) and in Italian: &quot;un capo di bestiame&quot; (&quot;one head of cattle&quot;). Note the difference between &quot;five head of cattle&quot; (meaning five animals), and &quot;five heads of cattle&quot; (identical to &quot;five cattle&#x27;s heads&quot;, meaning specifically their heads). A similar phrase used by florists is &quot;ten stem of roses&quot; (meaning roses on their stems).

European languages naturally use measure words. These are required for counting in the case of mass nouns, and some can also be used with count nouns. For example, one can have a &quot;glass&quot; of beer, and a &quot;handful&quot; of coins. The English construction with &quot;of&quot; is paralleled in many languages, although in German (and similarly in Dutch and the Scandinavian languages) the two words are simply juxtaposed, e.g. one says &quot;ein Glas Bier&quot; (literally &quot;a glass beer&quot;, with no word for &quot;of&quot;). Slavic languages put the second noun in the genitive case (e.g. Russian (), literally &quot;a beer&#x27;s glass&quot;), but Bulgarian, having lost the Slavic case system, uses expressions identical to German (e.g. ).

Certain nouns are associated with particular measure words or other classifier-like words that enable them to be counted. For example, &quot;paper&quot; is often counted in &quot;sheets&quot; as in &quot;five sheets of paper&quot;. Usage or non-usage of measure words may yield different meanings, e.g. &quot;five papers&quot; is grammatically equally correct but refers to newspapers or academic papers. Some inherently plural nouns require the word &quot;&quot; (or its equivalent) to enable reference to a single object or specified number of objects, as in &quot;a pair of scissors&quot;, &quot;three pairs of pants&quot;, or the French &quot;une paire de lunettes&quot; (&quot;a pair of (eye)glasses&quot;).

=== Australian Aboriginal Languages ===
Australian Aboriginal languages are known for often having extensive noun class systems based on semantic criteria. In many cases, a given noun can be identified as a member of a given class via an adjacent classifier, which can either form a hyponym construction with a specific noun, or act as a generic noun on its own.

==== Kuuk Thaayorre ====
In the following example from Kuuk Thaayorre, the specific borrowed noun &quot;tin.meat&quot; &#x27;tinned meat&#x27; is preceded by its generic classifier &quot;minh&quot; &#x27;meat.&#x27;

In the next example, the same classifier &quot;minh&quot; stands in on its own for a generic crocodile (&quot;punc&quot;), another member of the &quot;minh&quot; class:

Classifiers and specific nouns in Kuuk Thaayorre can also co-occupy the head of a noun phrase to form something like a compound or complex noun as in &quot;ngat minh.patp&quot; &#x27; hawk&#x27; which is the complex noun meaning &#x27;stingray&#x27;.

==== Diyari ====
Another example of this kind of hyponym construction can be seen in Diyari:

See the nine Diyari classifiers below

==== Ngalakgan ====
Contrast the above with Ngalakgan in which classifiers are prefixes on the various phrasal heads of the entire noun phrase (including modifiers):

Ngalakgan has fewer noun classes than many Australian Languages, the complete set of its class prefixes are below:

===Bengali, Assamese, Maithili and Nepali===

Atypically for an Indo-European language, Bengali makes use of classifiers. Every noun in this language must have its corresponding classifier when used with a numeral or other quantifier. Most nouns take the generic classifier &quot;ṭa&quot;, although there are many more specific measure words, such as &quot;jon&quot;, which is only used to count humans. Still, there are many fewer measure words in Bengali than in Chinese or Japanese. As in Chinese, Bengali nouns are not inflected for number.

Similar to the situation in Chinese, measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. &quot;aṭ biṛal&quot; instead of &quot;aṭ-ṭa biṛal&quot; &quot;eight cats&quot;) would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, it is common to omit the classifier when it counts a noun that is not in the nominative case (e.g., (eight cats-possessive country ), or (five ghosts-instrumental ate)) or when the number is very large (e.g., &quot;ek sho lok esechhe&quot; (&quot;One hundred people have come.&quot;)). Classifiers may also be dropped when the focus of the sentence is not on the actual counting but on a statement of fact (e.g., &quot;amar char chhele&quot; (I-possessive four boy, I have four sons)). The -ṭa suffix comes from /goṭa/ &#x27;piece&#x27;, and is also used as a definite article.

Omitting the noun and preserving the classifier is grammatical and common. For example, &quot;Shudhu êk-jon thakbe.&quot; (lit. &quot;Only one-MW will remain.&quot;) would be understood to mean &quot;Only one person will remain.&quot;, since &quot;jon&quot; can only be used to count humans. The word &quot;lok&quot; &quot;person&quot; is implied.

Maithili, Nepali and Assamese have systems very similar to Bengali&#x27;s. Maithili uses for objects and for humans; similarly, Nepali has (-वटा) for objects and - (-जना) for humans.

Assamese, Chittagonian, Sylheti and other Bengali-Assamese languages have more classifiers than Bengali. The presence of classifiers in Northeast India may be linked to contact with the Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic languages spoken in the region.

Persian has a scheme very similar to the Indo-Aryan languages Bengali, Assamese, Maithili and Nepali.

=== Persian ===
Although not always used in written language, Persian uses classifiers regularly in spoken word. Persian has two general-use classifiers, () and (), the former of which is used with singular nouns, while the latter is used with plural nouns.

In addition to general-use classifiers, Persian also has several specific classifiers, including the following:

===Burmese===

In Burmese, classifiers, in the form of particles, are used when counting or measuring nouns. They immediately follow the numerical quantification. Nouns to which classifiers refer can be omitted if the context allows, because many classifiers have implicit meanings.



=== Thai ===

Thai employs classifiers in the widest range of NP constructions compared to similar classifier languages from the area. Classifiers are obligatory for nouns followed by numerals in Thai. Nouns in Thai are counted by a specific classifier, which are usually grammaticalized nouns. An example of a grammaticalized noun functioning as a classifier is (). is used for people (except monks and royalty) and literally translates to &#x27;person&#x27;. The general form for numerated nouns in Thai is &quot;noun-numeral-classifier&quot;. Similar to Mandarin Chinese, classifiers in Thai are also used when the noun is accompanied by a demonstrative. However, this is not obligatory in the case of demonstratives. Demonstratives also require a different word order than for numerals. The general scheme for demonstratives is &quot;noun-classifier-demonstrative&quot;. In some instances, classifiers are also used to denote singularity. Thai nouns are bare nominals and are ambiguous regarding number. In order to differentiate between the expression &quot;this child&quot; vs. &quot;these children&quot;, a classifier is added to the noun followed by a demonstrative. This &#x27;singularity effect&#x27; is apparent in (child-classifier-this) referring exclusively to one child as opposed to (child this), which is vague in terms of number. 

Combining nouns with adjectives could be simply done without the use of classifiers such as (, old car), it is sometimes necessary to add a classifier in order to distinguish the specific object from a group e.g (, the old car). Some quantifiers require classifiers in Thai. It has been claimed that quantifiers which do not require classifiers are adjuncts and those which do are part of the functional structure of the noun phrase. Quantifiers which require a classifier include (, every) (, some). This is also the case of approximations e.g. (, some dogs). Negative quantification is simply expressed by adding (, there are not) in front of the noun.

Complex nominal phrases can yield expressions containing several classifiers. This phenomenon is rather unique to Thai, compared to other classifier languages from the region. 
===Chinese===
Although classifiers were not often used in Classical Chinese, in all modern Chinese varieties such as Mandarin, nouns are normally required to be accompanied by a classifier or measure word when they are qualified by a numeral or by a demonstrative. Examples with numerals have been given above in the Overview section. An example with a demonstrative is the phrase for &quot;this person&quot; — 这个人 &quot;zhè ge rén.&quot; The character 个 is a classifier, literally meaning &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;single entity&quot;, so the entire phrase translates literally as &quot;this &quot;individual&quot; person&quot; or &quot;this &quot;single&quot; person&quot;. A similar example is the phrase for &quot;these people&quot; — 这群人 &quot;zhè qún rén&quot;, where the classifier 群 means &quot;group&quot; or &quot;herd&quot;, so the phrase literally means &quot;this group [of] people&quot; or &quot;this crowd&quot;.

The noun in a classifier phrase may be omitted, if the context and choice of classifier make the intended noun obvious. An example of this again appears in the Overview section above.

The choice of a classifier for each noun is somewhat arbitrary and must be memorized by learners of Chinese, but often relates to the object&#x27;s physical characteristics. For example, the character 条 &quot;tiáo&quot; originally means &quot;twig&quot; or &quot;thin branch&quot;, is now used most often as a classifier for thin, elongated things such as rope, snake and fish, and can be translated as &quot;(a) length (of)&quot;, &quot;strip&quot; or &quot;line&quot;.

Not all classifiers derive from nouns, however. For example, the character 張/张 &quot;zhāng&quot; is originally a verb meaning &quot;to span (a bow)&quot;, and is now used as a classifier to denote squarish flat objects such as paper, hide, or (the surface of) table, and can be more or less translated as &quot;sheet&quot;. The character 把 &quot;bǎ&quot; was originally a verb meaning &quot;to grasp/grip&quot;, but is now more commonly used as the noun for &quot;handle&quot;, and as the classifier for &quot;handful&quot;.

Technically a distinction is made between classifiers (or &quot;count-classifiers&quot;), which are used only with count nouns and do not generally carry any meaning of their own, and measure words (or &quot;mass-classifiers&quot;), which can be used also with mass nouns and specify a particular quantity (such as &quot;bottle&quot; [of water] or &quot;pound&quot; [of fruit]). Less formally, however, the term &quot;measure word&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;classifier&quot;.

===Gilbertese===
In Gilbertese, classifiers must be used as a suffix when counting. The appropriate classifier is chosen based on the kind and shape of the noun, and combines with the numeral, sometimes adopting several different forms.

There is a general classifier (-&quot;ua&quot;) which exists in simple numbers (te-ua-na 1; uo-ua 2; ten-ua 3; a-ua 4; nima-ua 5; until 9) and is used when there is no specific classifier and for counting periods of time and years; and specific classifiers like: 
* -man (for people, animals, small fishes; &quot;te man&quot; alone means bird (&quot;man-ni-kiba&quot;, flying animal) or small bug); 
* -ai (for big fishes and cetaceans);
* -waa (for canoes and, by extension, all vehicles (&quot;a-waa te waanikiba&quot; means &quot;4 planes&quot; - &quot;waa-ni-kiba&quot;, literal meaning is &quot;flying canoe&quot;);

=== Japanese ===
In Japanese grammar, classifiers must be used with a number when counting nouns. The appropriate classifier is chosen based on the kind and shape of the noun, and combines with the numeral, sometimes adopting several different forms.



===Korean===

The Korean language has classifiers in the form of suffixes which attach to numerals. For example, &quot;jang&quot; (장) is used to count sheets of paper, blankets, leaves, and other similar objects: &quot;ten bus tickets&quot; could be translated &quot;beoseu pyo yeol-jang&quot; (버스 표 열 장), literally &quot;bus ticket ten-[classifier]&quot;.




===Malay/Indonesian===
In Malay grammar, classifiers are used to count all nouns, including concrete nouns, abstract nouns and phrasal nouns. Nouns are not reduplicated for plural form when used with classifiers, definite or indefinite, although Mary Dalrymple and Suriel Mofu give counterexamples where reduplication and classifiers co-occur. In informal language, classifiers can be used with numbers alone without the nouns if the context is well known.
The Malay term for classifiers is &quot;penjodoh bilangan&quot;, while the term in Indonesian is &quot;kata penggolong&quot;.





===Vietnamese===

Vietnamese uses a similar set of classifiers to Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

===Khmer===

Khmer (Cambodian) also uses classifiers, although they can quite frequently be omitted. Since it is a head-first language, the classifier phrase (number plus classifier) comes after the noun.

===Santali===
Santali uses several sets of classifiers. They can be divided into three classes: &quot;tɛn&quot; (variant &quot;tɛc&quot;, &quot;taŋ&quot;) for &#x27;one&#x27; and non-human beings; &quot;ea&quot; with numerals &#x27;two&#x27;, &#x27;four&#x27; and &#x27;twenty&#x27;; &quot;gɔtɛn&quot; (variant &quot;gɔtɜc&quot;) with numerals from &#x27;five&#x27; to &#x27;ten&#x27; and with the distributive numerals.

===American Sign Language===

In American Sign Language classifier constructions are used to express position, stative description (size and shape), and how objects are handled manually. The particular hand shape used to express any of these constructions is what functions as the classifier. Various hand shapes can represent whole entities; show how objects are handled or instruments are used; represent limbs; and be used to express various characteristics of entities such as dimensions, shape, texture, position, and path and manner of motion. While the label of classifiers has been accepted by many sign language linguists, some argue that these constructions do not parallel oral-language classifiers in all respects and prefer to use other terms, such as polymorphemic or polycomponential signs.

Examples:
*1 hand shape: used for individuals standing or long thin objects
*A hand shape: used for compact objects
*C hand shape: used for cylindrical objects
*3 hand shape: used for ground vehicles
*ILY hand shape: used for aircraft

==Global distribution==
Classifiers are part of the grammar of most East Asian languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malay, Burmese, Thai, Hmong, and the Bengali and Munda languages just to the west of the East and Southeast Asia linguistic area. They are present in many Australian Aboriginal languages, including Yidiny and Murrinhpatha. Among indigenous languages of the Americas, classifiers are present in the Pacific Northwest, especially among the Tsimshianic languages, and in many languages of Mesoamerica, including Classic Maya and most of its modern derivatives. They also occur in some languages of the Amazon Basin (most famously Yagua) and a very small number of West African languages.

In contrast, classifiers are entirely absent not only from European languages, but also from many languages of northern Asia (Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic and mainland Paleosiberian languages), and also from the indigenous languages of the southern parts of both North and South America. In Austronesian languages, classifiers are quite common and may have been acquired as a result of contact with Mon–Khmer languages but the most remote members such as Malagasy and Hawaiian have lost them.

The &quot;World Atlas of Language Structures&quot; has a global map showing 400 languages and chapter text including geographical discussion:

==Noun classifiers versus noun classes==
The concept of noun classifier is distinct from that of noun class.

*Classifier systems typically involve 20 or more, or even several hundred, classifiers (separate lexemes that co-occur with nouns). Noun class systems (including systems of grammatical gender) typically comprise a closed set of two to twenty classes, into which all nouns in the language are divided.
*Not every noun need take a classifier, and many nouns can occur with different classifiers. In a language with noun classes, each noun typically belongs to one and only one class, which is usually shown by a word form or an accompanying article and functions grammatically. The same referent can be referred to by nouns with different noun classes, such as &quot;die Frau&quot; &quot;the woman&quot; (feminine) and &quot;das Weib&quot; &quot;the woman (archaic, pejorative)&quot; (neuter) in German.
*Noun classes are typically marked by inflection, i.e. through bound morphemes which cannot appear alone in a sentence. Class may be marked on the noun itself, but will also often be marked on other constituents in the noun phrase or in the sentence that show agreement with the noun. Noun classifiers are always free lexical items that occur in the same noun phrase as the noun they qualify. They never form a morphological unit with the noun, and there is never agreement marking on the verb.
*The classifier occurs in only some syntactic environments. In addition, use of the classifier may be influenced by the pragmatics of style and the choice of written or spoken mode. Often, the more formal the style, the richer the variety of classifiers used, and the higher the frequency of their use. Noun class markers are mandatory under all circumstances.
*Noun classifiers are usually derived from words used as names of concrete, discrete, moveable objects. Noun class markers are typically affixes without any literal meaning.

Nevertheless, there is no clearly demarked difference between the two: since classifiers often evolve into class systems, they are two extremes of a grammaticalization continuum.

==Conceptual similarity to determinatives (writing systems)==

The Egyptian hieroglyphic script is formed of a repertoire of hundreds of graphemes which play different semiotic roles. Almost every word ends with an unpronounced grapheme (the so-called &quot;determinative&quot;) that carries no additional phonetic value of its own. As such, this hieroglyph is a &quot;mute&quot; icon, which does not exist on the spoken level of language but supplies the word in question, through its iconic meaning alone, with extra semantic information.

In recent years, this system of unpronounced graphemes was compared to classifiers in spoken languages. The results show that the two systems, those of unpronounced graphemic classifiers and those of pronounced classifiers in classifier languages obey similar rules of use and function. The graphemic classifiers of the hieroglyphic script presents an emic image of knowledge organization in the Ancient Egyptian mind.

Similar graphemic classifiers are known also in Hieroglyphic Luwian and in 
Chinese scripts.

<text>Robert Emmet Sherwood (April 4, 1896 – November 14, 1955) was an American playwright and screenwriter.

He is the author of &quot;Waterloo Bridge, Idiot&#x27;s Delight, Abe Lincoln in Illinois, There Shall Be No Night&quot;, and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;. He was a screenwriter on the adapted films &quot;Rebecca&quot; and &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama , an Academy Award for Best Screenplay (1947) and a Pulitzer Prize for Biography (1948).

==Early life and family==

Born in 1896 in New Rochelle, New York, Robert was a son of Arthur Murray Sherwood, a rich stockbroker, and his wife, the former Rosina Emmet, a highly accomplished illustrator and portrait painter known as Rosina E. Sherwood. His paternal grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Wilson Sherwood, was an author and social leader. He was a great-great-grandson of the former New York State Attorney General Thomas Addis Emmet and a great-grandnephew of the Irish nationalist Robert Emmet, who was executed for high treason after leading the Irish rebellion of 1803, one of a series of attempts to dislodge British rule in Ireland, in 1803. His relatives also included three other notable American portrait artists: his aunts, Lydia Field Emmet and Jane Emmet de Glehn, and his first cousin, once removed, Ellen Emmet Rand.
Sherwood was educated at Fay School, Milton Academy and then Harvard University.

He fought with the Royal Highlanders of Canada, CEF in Europe during World War I and was wounded. After his return to the United States, he began working as a movie critic for magazines, including &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Sherwood&#x27;s career as a critic in the 1920s is discussed in the 2009 documentary &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot;. In this film &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Schickel discusses, among other topics, how Sherwood was the first New York critic invited to Hollywood by cross-country train to meet the stars and directors.

==Writing career==
Sherwood was one of the original members of the Algonquin Round Table. He was close friends with Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley, who were on the staff of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; with Sherwood when the Round Table began meeting in 1919. Author Edna Ferber was also a good friend.

In 1920, Sherwood became editor of &quot;Life&quot;. 

Sherwood&#x27;s first Broadway play, &quot;The Road to Rome&quot; (1927), a comedy concerning Hannibal&#x27;s botched invasion of Rome, introduced one of his favorite themes: the futility of war. Many of his later dramatic works employed variations of this theme, including &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1936), which won Sherwood the first of four Pulitzer Prizes. According to legend, he once admitted to the gossip columnist Lucius Beebe: “The trouble with me is that I start with a big message and end up with nothing but good entertainment.”

Sherwood was actively engaged with the advocacy for writers&#x27; rights within the theatre world. From 1937 to 1939, Sherwood served as the seventh president of the Dramatists Guild of America.

Sherwood&#x27;s Broadway success soon attracted the attention of Hollywood; he began writing for movies in 1926. While some of his work went uncredited, his films included many adaptations of his plays. He also collaborated with Alfred Hitchcock and Joan Harrison in writing the screenplay for &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940).

With Europe in the midst of World War II, Sherwood set aside his anti-war stance to support the fight against the Third Reich. &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;, his 1940 play about the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Finland, was produced by the Playwright&#x27;s Company that he co-founded, and it starred Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, and Montgomery Clift. Katharine Cornell produced and starred in a 1957 TV adaptation on TV. Sherwood publicly ridiculed isolationist Charles Lindbergh as a &quot;Nazi with a Nazi&#x27;s Olympian contempt for all democratic processes&quot;.

During this period Sherwood also served as a speechwriter for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He recounted the experience in his book &quot;Roosevelt and Hopkins: An Intimate History&quot;, which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and a 1949 Bancroft Prize. Sherwood is credited with originating the phrase that eventually evolved to &quot;arsenal of democracy&quot;, a frequent catchphrase in Roosevelt&#x27;s wartime speeches. Sherwood was quoted on May 12, 1940, by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;This country is already, in effect, an arsenal for the democratic Allies.&quot;

After serving as director of the Overseas Branch of the Office of War Information from 1943 until the conclusion of the war, he returned to dramatic writing with the movie &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, directed by William Wyler. The 1946 film, which explores changes in the lives of three soldiers after they return home from war, earned Sherwood an Academy Award for Best Screenplay.

==Comments regarding Sherwood&#x27;s height==
Sherwood stood tall. Dorothy Parker, who was , once commented that when she, Sherwood, and Robert Benchley () walked down the street together, they resembled &quot;a walking pipe organ.&quot; When asked at a party how long he had known Sherwood, Benchley stood on a chair, raised his hand to the ceiling, and said &quot;I knew Bob Sherwood back when he was only this tall.&quot;

In 1949, comedian Groucho Marx also commented about Sherwood&#x27;s height during a filmed radio broadcast of the quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. Groucho, who hosted the popular series, interviewed in one episode American football player Howard Scala, a member of the NFL&#x27;s Green Bay Packers. Impressed by Scala&#x27;s own considerable height, Marx shared the following anecdote with the show&#x27;s audience:

==Death and legacy==
Sherwood died of a heart attack in New York City in 1955. A production of &quot;Small War on Murray Hill&quot;, his final work, debuted on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on January 3, 1957.

Sherwood was portrayed by actor Nick Cassavetes in &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;, a 1994 movie about the Algonquin Round Table.
