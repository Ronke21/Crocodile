<text>Verbena (), also known as vervain or verveine, is a genus in the family Verbenaceae. It contains about 150 species of annual and perennial herbaceous or semi-woody flowering plants. The majority of the species are native to the Americas and Asia; however, &quot;Verbena officinalis&quot;, the common vervain or common verbena, is the type species and native to Europe.

==Naming==
In English, the name &quot;Verbena&quot; is usually used in the United States and the United Kingdom; elsewhere, the terms &quot;verveine&quot; or &quot;vervain&quot; are in use.

==Description==

Verbena is a herbaceous flowering plant, belonging to the Verbenaceae family, and may be annual or perennial depending on the species. The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and in many species hairy, often densely so. The flowers are small, with five petals, and borne in dense spikes. Typically some shade of blue, they may also be white, pink, or purple, especially in cultivars.

The genus can be divided into a diploid North American and a polyploid South American lineage, both with a base chromosome number of seven. The European species is derived from the North American lineage. It seems that verbena as well as the related mock vervains (&quot;Glandularia&quot;) evolved from the assemblage provisionally treated under the genus name &quot;Junellia&quot;; both other genera were usually included in the Verbenaceae until the 1990s. Intergeneric chloroplast gene transfer by an undetermined mechanism – though probably not hybridization – has occurred at least twice from vervains to &quot;Glandularia&quot;, between the ancestors of the present-day South American lineages and once more recently, between &quot;V. orcuttiana&quot; or &quot;V. hastata&quot; and &quot;G. bipinnatifida&quot;. In addition, several species of verbena are of natural hybrid origin; the well-known garden vervain/verbena has an entirely muddy history. The relationships of this close-knit group are therefore hard to resolve with standard methods of computational phylogenetics.

==Cultivation==

Some species, hybrids and cultivars of verbena are used as ornamental plants. They are drought-resistant, tolerating full to partial sun, and enjoy well-drained, average soils. Plants are usually grown from seed. Some species and hybrids are not hardy and are treated as half-hardy annuals in bedding schemes.

They are valued in butterfly gardening in suitable climates, attracting Lepidoptera such as the Hummingbird hawk-moth, Chocolate albatross, or the Pipevine swallowtail, and also hummingbirds, especially &quot;V. officinalis&quot;, which is also grown as a honey plant.

The hybrid cultivars &quot;Silver Anne&quot; and &quot;Sissinghurst&quot; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Pests and diseases==
For some verbena pathogens, see List of verbena diseases. Cultivated verbenas are sometimes parasitized by sweet potato whitefly (&quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot;) and spread this pest to other crops.

==Uses==
Although verbena (&quot;vervain&quot;) has been used in herbalism and traditional medicine, usually as an herbal tonic, there is no high-quality evidence for its effectiveness. Verbena has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. According to Cancer Research UK, &quot;essence therapists believe that using essences can help to increase your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. However, essences are not used to prevent, control, or cure cancer or any other physical condition.&quot;

The essential oil of various species, mainly common vervain, is traded as &quot;Spanish verbena oil&quot;. Considered inferior to oil of lemon verbena (&quot;Aloysia citrodora&quot;) in perfumery, it is of some commercial importance for herbalism.

==In culture==
Verbena has long been associated with divine and other supernatural forces. It was called &quot;tears of Isis&quot; in ancient Egypt, and later called &quot;Hera&#x27;s tears&quot;. In ancient Greece, it was dedicated to Eos Erigineia. The generic name is the Latin term for a plant sacred to the ancient Romans. Pliny the Elder describes &quot;verbena&quot; presented on Jupiter altars; it is not entirely clear if this referred to a verbena rather than the general term for prime sacrificial herbs.

Pliny the Elder notes &quot;the Magi especially make the maddest statements about the plant: that [among other things] a circle must be drawn with iron round the plant&quot;. The common names of verbena in many Central and Eastern European languages often associate it with iron. These include for example the Dutch &#x27; (&quot;iron-hard&quot;), Danish &#x27; (&quot;medical ironwort&quot;), German &#x27; (&quot;true ironherb&quot;), Slovak &#x27; (&quot;medical ironherb&quot;), and Hungarian &quot;&quot; (&quot;iron grass&quot;).

In the early Christian era, folk legend stated that &quot;V. officinalis&quot; was used to stanch Jesus&#x27; wounds after his removal from the cross. It was consequently called &quot;holy herb&quot; or (e.g. in Wales) &quot;Devil&#x27;s bane&quot;.

According to the Wiccan writer Doreen Valiente, Vervain flowers signify the goddess Diana and are often depicted on &quot;cimaruta&quot;, traditional Italian amulets. In the 1870 &quot;The History and Practice of Magic&quot; by &quot;Paul Christian&quot; (Jean-Baptiste Pitois), it is employed in the preparation of a mandragora charm. The book also describes its antiseptic capabilities (p. 336), and use as a protection against spells (pp. 339, 414). Romani people use vervain for love and good luck.

While common vervain is not native to North America, it has been introduced there; for example, the Pawnee have adopted it as an entheogen enhancer and in oneiromancy (dream divination), much as &quot;Calea zacatechichi&quot; is used in Mexico.
An indeterminate vervain is among the plants on the eighth panel of the New World Tapestry (&quot;Expedition to Cape Cod&quot;).

In the Victorian language of flowers, verbena held the dual meaning of enchantment and sensibility.

<text>The House of Kamsarakan () was an Armenian noble family that was an offshoot of the House of Karen, also known as the Karen-Pahlav. The Karens were one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran and were of Parthian origin.

In the Byzantine-Sasanian era, the Kamsarakan were mostly known for following a pro-Byzantine policy. In the late 8th century, they met their downfall as a result of participating in an uprising against Arab rule.

After the 8th century, a branch of the Kamsarakan, the Pahlavuni, rose to prominence. According to Cyril Toumanoff the Pahlavunis in turn had two branches: the Mkhargrdzeli, associated with the Kingdom of Georgia; and the Hethumids, associated with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.

==Background and history==
===The Kamsarakan family===
A branch of the House of Karen (Karen-Pahlav), one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, the name of Kamsarakan is derived from Prince Kamsar, who died in 325. The Kamsarakans had their base in the &quot;two princely states&quot;, which were both located in the historic region of Ayrarat-Arsharunik. The city of Yervandashat, in present-day eastern Turkey, was their capital. The fortresses of Bagaran, Artagers, Shirak and Ani (which later became a city) were also associated with the Kamsarakan.

From their establishment the Kamsarakans enjoyed prestige in Armenia due to being the cousins of the royal Arsacids. Following the demise of the Arsacids in Armenia in 428 the Kamsarakan acquired a large amount of political power due to their position as important border lords; or, as Toumanoff puts it &quot;to their quasi-margravial position on the northern frontier of the realm&quot;. The Kamsarakans had a high rank in the order of precedence of the Armenian princes; they supposedly ranked second &quot;of the four broad classes&quot;. As such they had a feudal obligation to supply 600 horses to their suzerain, the King of Armenia.

According to Cyril Toumanoff / &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, due to the geographical location of their principalities, the Kamsarakan were not involved &quot;in any special way in Armino-Iranian relations&quot;. However, according to Parvaneh Pourshariati / &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, the Kamsarakan &quot;were directly involved in the history of the Byzantines and the Sasanians&quot;. When the Roman Empire annexed the western part of historic Armenia, GazavonII Kamsarak and other family members moved to Sasanian Armenia, at the time ruled by an Armenian vassal. Prior to this GazavonII had been the leader of the pro-Roman Armenian princes. Later another Kamsarakan family member, ArshavirII, is recorded as having participated in the anti-Sasanian revolt led by Vardan Mamikonian. ArshavirII also took part in the insurrection of 482–484, together with his son and successor Nerses.

The Kamsarakans were known for following a broadly pro-Byzantine policy, and they were actively involved in the political life of the empire as well. For example, three brothers from the Kamsarakan family served as generals for Justinian I (r. 527–565); Narses, Isaac the Armenian (Sahak), and another Isaac (Sahak), who was executed by the king of the Ostrogoths, Totila, in 546. A later Kamsarakan, NarsesII Kamsarakan, served as presiding prince of Armenia for the Byzantine emperor in the late 7th century, and also held the high-ranking Byzantine office of &quot;curopalates&quot;. Another individual, presumably a Kamsarak, was the patrician Arsaber (Arshavir), noted for revolting against the Byzantine emperor in 808.

The Kamsarakans took part in the revolt against Arab rule in Armenia in 771–772. When the insurrection failed, the Kamsarakan were amongst the &quot;victims of the disaster&quot;, and they had no choice but to sell their &quot;double princedom&quot; to the Bagratids.

===The Pahlavuni family===
In the Bagratid era, the Kamsarakan rose to prominence once again, now represented by its cadet branch the Pahlavunis, led by the princes Bdjni and Nig. Cyril Toumanoff notes: 

When the Bagratids were destroyed and Prince Gregory II abdicated in 1045–1046 to allow the Byzantine emperor to assume control over his lands, the Pahlavunis moved to Cilicia, where they were known as the Hethumids. They dominated this &quot;last phase of Armenia’s political history&quot;, first as princes of Lambrun, and after 1226, as kings of Armenia. When the Hethumids died out in the 14th century the Armenian crown passed, through inheritance, to the Lusignan dynasty of Cyprus, and afterwards to the House of Savoy. The Mkhargrdzeli, another branch of the Pahlavunis, were a dominant force in the Kingdom of Georgia in the 12th14th centuries, and &quot;has survived to this day&quot;.

===Patrons of architecture===
The Kamsarakans and their Pahlavuni branch, and in turn the Mkhargrdzelis, were known for being patrons of Armenian architecture. Notable examples of structures built by the family include castles and palaces, as well as &quot;splendid churches&quot;, such as the Church of St. Gregory (commissioned by AbughamrI Pahlavuni).

<text>Tmorik () was a region and system of defenses in the south of the Kingdom of Armenia. It was named after its main fortress, which was also known as Alki. It was built in ancient times (2nd millennium BCE) as a bulwark against threats coming from Mesopotamia. Once a district () of its own the province of Korchayk, it was later attached to the district of Kordrik, probably under the Arsacid dynasty. It is identified with the or mentioned in 13th–7th-century BCE Assyrian cuneiform inscriptions as one of the Nairi lands. It may be one of the lands mentioned by Strabo which were conquered by Artaxias I in the 2nd century BCE. Strabo refers to a land called , which has alternatively been read as * and identified with Tmorik.

Robert Hewsen identifies Tmorik as the region surrounding the fortress of Tman on the slopes of Mt. Sararad/Ararad (modern-day Mount Judi in southeastern Turkey). However, this is disputed by Michał Marciak, who, following Heinrich Hübschmann, identified the fortress of Tmorik/Alki with the town of Elki (modern-day Beytüşşebap, Turkey) on the east bank of the Khabur River (a tributary of the Tigris).

<doc id="1117425" wikidata="Q795966" url="?curid=1117425" title="ISO 6346">
<text>ISO 6346 is an international standard covering the coding, identification and marking of intermodal (shipping) containers used within containerized intermodal freight transport by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The standard establishes a visual identification system for every container that includes a unique serial number (with check digit), the owner, a country code, a size, type and equipment category as well as any operational marks. The register of container owners is managed by the International Container Bureau (BIC).

==Identification system==
Example of an ISO 6346 compliant container number:

The illustrated example is a code for a container owned by Hapag-Lloyd AG.

===Owner code===
The owner code consists of three capital letters of the Latin alphabet to indicate the owner or principal operator of the container. Such code needs to be registered at the Bureau International des Containers in Paris to ensure uniqueness worldwide. An owner can apply for more than one code, as normally the first 2 letters are used as the owner code and the third is used to indicate pool (e.g. HLA, HLB, HLX are some Hapag-Lloyd codes to indicate whether container is standard, reefer...)

===Equipment category identifier===
The equipment category identifier consists of one of the following capital letters of the Latin alphabet:
*U for all freight containers
*J for detachable freight container-related equipment
*Z for trailers and chassis

Presently, all official BIC container codes end in &quot;U&quot;. However, the Association of American Railroads recognizes similar codes for their containers and trailers travelling by rail in North America, though these are not recognized by the BIC and lack check digits.

Under the ISO code, then, only U, J, and Z are in use. The refrigerated (reefer) container is identified by means of the size type code.

===Serial number===
The serial number consists of 6 numeric digits, assigned by the owner or operator, uniquely identifying the container within that owner/operator&#x27;s fleet.

===Check digit===
The check digit consists of one numeric digit providing a means of validating the recording and transmission accuracy of the owner code and serial number.

To compute the check digit, the letters have to be converted to numbers. This is done in three steps:

====Calculation step 1====
An equivalent numerical value is assigned to each letter of the alphabet, beginning with 10 for the letter A (11 and multiples thereof are omitted):

The individual digits of the serial number keep their numeric value.

====Calculation step 2====
Each of the numbers calculated in step 1 is multiplied by 2position, where position is the exponent to base 2. Position starts at 0, from left to right.

The following table shows the multiplication factors:
====Calculation step 3====

If the final difference is 10, then the check digit becomes 0. To ensure that this does not happen the standard recommends that serial numbers should not be used which produce a final difference of 10; however, there are containers in the market which do not follow this recommendation, so handling this case has to be included if a check digit calculator is programmed.

Virtually all programming languages have a modulo operator for step 3; some languages (also) return the decimal portion which must be multiplied by 11 to get a proper modulo. 11 is used as divisor because a container number has 11 letters and digits in total. In step 1 the numbers 11, 22 and 33 are left out as they are multiples of the divisor.

====Example====

===Practical problems===
In day-to-day business it happens that containers do appear which do not follow the ISO 6346 identification at all; however, they are fully CSC safety approved containers. Usually these are &quot;shippers owned&quot; containers (SOC), which means that they are not owned by the carrier but supplied by the cargo owners (shippers). They may have no registered owner code and no category identifier and have no check digit. It is advisable to follow ISO 6346 as the absence of a compliant identification code causes problems for both carriers and container terminals to correctly identify the equipment and properly deliver the cargo, because computer systems require ISO 6346-conforming naming and as such missing prefixes are invented. For example, YYYY at the carrier and XXXX at the terminal causes the equipment to mismatch. Moreover, since ISO 6346 identification has become a requirement in international Customs conventions (Customs Conventions on Containers and Istanbul Convention), many Customs Administrations have begun validating that containers are marked as per the standard.

==Size and type codes==
The codes are compiled of the following elements:
*First character, representing the length (coded)
*Second character, representing the width and height (coded)
*Third and fourth character indicating the type of the container

The following is an overview of the most common codes:

Use the below to calculate size/type of a less commonly used ISO 6346 containers:

==Country code (optional)==
The country code consists of two capital letters of the Latin alphabet as described in ISO 3166-1. It indicates the country where the code is registered not the nationality of the owner or operator of the container. The letters of the code shall not be less than high.

==Mandatory operational marks==
Operational marks are intended solely to convey information requested for the movement of containers or give visual warnings. They relate to
*the weight of containers
*a symbol to denote air-surface container
*a sign warning of overhead electrical danger
*height marks for containers higher than

<text>Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug. After its discovery in 1975, its first uses were in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis. Approved for human use in 1987, it is used to treat infestations including head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis and lymphatic filariasis. It works through many mechanisms to kill the targeted parasites, and can be taken by mouth, or applied to the skin for external infestations. It belongs to the avermectin family of medications.
William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and applications. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antiparasitic agent. In 2022, it was the 314th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 200,000 prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine. Ivermectin is available in a fixed-dose combination with albendazole.

Misinformation has been widely spread claiming that ivermectin is beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19. Such claims are not backed by credible scientific evidence. Multiple major health organizations, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Medicines Agency, and the World Health Organization have advised that ivermectin is not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.

== Medical uses ==
Ivermectin is used to treat human diseases caused by roundworms and a wide variety of external parasites.

===Worm infections===
For river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis, ivermectin is typically given as part of mass drug administration campaigns that distribute the drug to all members of a community affected by the disease. Adult worms survive in the skin and eventually recover to produce larval worms again; to keep the worms at bay, ivermectin is given at least once per year for the 1015-year lifespan of the adult worms.

The World Health Organization (WHO) considers ivermectin the for strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin is also the primary treatment for &quot;Mansonella ozzardi&quot; and cutaneous larva migrans. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ivermectin, albendazole, or mebendazole as treatments for ascariasis. Ivermectin is sometimes added to albendazole or mebendazole for whipworm treatment, and is considered a second-line treatment for gnathostomiasis. When co-administered, ivermectin and albendazole act in synergy. Ivermectin targets the parasite&#x27;s nervous and muscular systems, causing paralysis, while albendazole disrupts the parasite&#x27;s metabolism and energy production. This dual approach immobilizes and kills the parasite and improves the treatment&#x27;s effectiveness.

In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive scientific opinion for ivermectin/albendazole for the treatment of infections caused by several types of worm parasites including lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for use in people aged five years of age or older, for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections, caused by different types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are spread through soil contaminated by human feces in areas with poor sanitation. Among the worms responsible for these diseases are hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), roundworms (&quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;), whipworms (&quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;) and a roundworm called &quot;Strongyloides stercoralis&quot;. Ivermectin/albendazole is also indicated for the treatment of microfilaraemia (the presence of worm larvae in the blood) in people with lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease commonly known as elephantiasis, which impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for the treatment of cases of lymphatic filariasis caused by &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, a parasite which is responsible for 90% of cases worldwide.

=== Mites and insects ===

Ivermectin is also used to treat infection with parasitic arthropods. Scabies – infestation with the mite &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot; – is most commonly treated with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin. A single application of permethrin is more efficacious than a single treatment of ivermectin. For most scabies cases, ivermectin is used in a two-dose regimen: the first dose kills the active mites, but not their eggs. Over the next week, the eggs hatch, and a second dose kills the newly hatched mites. The two-dose regimen of ivermectin has similar efficacy to the single dose permethrin treatment. Ivermectin is, however, more effective than permethrin when used in the mass treatment of endemic scabies.

For severe &quot;crusted scabies&quot;, where the parasite burden is orders of magnitude higher than usual, the CDC recommends up to seven doses of ivermectin over the course of a month, along with a topical antiparasitic. Both head lice and pubic lice can be treated with oral ivermectin, an ivermectin lotion applied directly to the affected area, or various other insecticides. Ivermectin is also used to treat rosacea and blepharitis, both of which can be caused or exacerbated by &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; mites.

== Contraindications ==
The only absolute contraindication to the use of ivermectin is hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of the formulation. In children under the age of five or those who weigh less than , there is limited data regarding the efficacy or safety of ivermectin, though the available data demonstrate few adverse effects. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions against use of ivermectin in such patients, as the blood–brain barrier is less developed, and thus there may be an increased risk of particular CNS side effects such as encephalopathy, ataxia, coma, or death. The American Academy of Family Physicians also recommends against use in these patients, given a lack of sufficient data to prove drug safety. Ivermectin is secreted in very low concentration in breast milk. It remains unclear if ivermectin is safe during pregnancy.

== Adverse effects ==

Side effects, although uncommon, include fever, itching, and skin rash when taken by mouth; and red eyes, dry skin, and burning skin when used topically for head lice. It is unclear if the drug is safe for use during pregnancy, but it is probably acceptable for use during breastfeeding.

Ivermectin is considered relatively free of toxicity in standard doses (around 300 μg/kg). Based on the data drug safety sheet for ivermectin, side effects are uncommon. However, serious adverse events following ivermectin treatment are more common in people with very high burdens of larval &quot;Loa loa&quot; worms in their blood. Those who have over 30,000 microfilaria per milliliter of blood risk inflammation and capillary blockage due to the rapid death of the microfilaria following ivermectin treatment.

One concern is neurotoxicity after large overdoses, which in most mammalian species may manifest as central nervous system depression, ataxia, coma, and death, as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory chloride channels.

Since drugs that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 often also inhibit P-glycoprotein transport, the risk of increased absorption past the blood-brain barrier exists when ivermectin is administered along with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. These drugs include statins, HIV protease inhibitors, many calcium channel blockers, lidocaine, benzodiazepines, and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone.

During a typical treatment course, ivermectin can cause minor aminotransferase elevations. In rare cases it can cause mild clinically apparent liver disease.

To provide context for the dosing and toxicity ranges, the of ivermectin in mice is 25 mg/kg (oral), and 80 mg/kg in dogs, corresponding to an approximated human-equivalent dose LD50 range of 2.02–43.24 mg/kg, which is far more than its FDA-approved usage (a single dose of 0.150–0.200 mg/kg to be used for specific parasitic infections). While ivermectin has also been studied for use in COVID-19, and while it has some ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, achieving 50% inhibition in vitro was found to require an estimated oral dose of 7.0 mg/kg (or 35x the maximum FDA-approved dosage), high enough to be considered ivermectin poisoning. Despite insufficient data to show any safe and effective dosing regimen for ivermectin in COVID-19, doses have been taken far more than FDA-approved dosing, leading the CDC to issue a warning of overdose symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, confusion, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, loss of coordination and balance, seizures, coma, and death. The CDC advises against consuming doses intended for livestock or doses intended for external use and warns that increasing misuse of ivermectin-containing products is increasing harmful overdoses.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Ivermectin and its related drugs act by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of helminths and insects. The drug binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels common to invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. The binding pushes the channels open, which increases the flow of chloride ions and hyper-polarizes the cell membranes, paralyzing and killing the invertebrate. Ivermectin is safe for mammals (at the normal therapeutic doses used to cure parasite infections) because mammalian glutamate-gated chloride channels only occur in the brain and spinal cord: the causative avermectins usually do not cross the blood–brain barrier, and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand-gated channels.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Ivermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection. Oral doses are absorbed into systemic circulation; the alcoholic solution form is more orally available than tablet and capsule forms. Ivermectin is widely distributed in the body.

Ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier of mammals due to the presence of P-glycoprotein (the &quot;MDR1&quot; gene mutation affects the function of this protein). Crossing may still become significant if ivermectin is given at high doses, in which case brain levels peak 2–5 hours after administration. In contrast to mammals, ivermectin can cross the blood-brain barrier in tortoises, often with fatal consequences.

Ivermectin is metabolized into eight different products by human CYP3A4, two of which (M1, M2) remain toxic to mosquitos. M1 and M2 also have longer elimination half-lives of about 55 hours. CYP3A5 produces a ninth metabolite.

== Chemistry ==

Fermentation of &quot;Streptomyces avermitilis&quot; yields eight closely related avermectin homologues, of which B1a and B1b form the bulk of the products isolated. In a separate chemical step, the mixture is hydrogenated to give ivermectin, which is an approximately 80:20 mixture of the two 22,23-dihydroavermectin compounds.

Ivermectin is a macrocyclical lactone.

== History ==

The avermectin family of compounds was discovered by Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University and William Campbell of Merck. In 1970, Ōmura isolated a strain of &quot;Streptomyces avermitilis&quot; from woodland soil near a golf course along the southeast coast of Honshu, Japan. Ōmura sent the bacteria to William Campbell, who showed that the bacterial culture could cure mice infected with the roundworm &quot;Heligmosomoides polygyrus&quot;. Campbell isolated the active compounds from the bacterial culture, naming them &quot;avermectins&quot; and the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces avermitilis&quot; for the compounds&#x27; ability to clear mice of worms (in Latin: &quot;a&quot; &#x27;without&#x27;, &quot;vermis&quot; &#x27;worms&#x27;). Of the various avermectins, Campbell&#x27;s group found the compound &quot;avermectin B1&quot; to be the most potent when taken orally. They synthesized modified forms of avermectin B1 to improve its pharmaceutical properties, eventually choosing a mixture of at least 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and up to 20% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, a combination they called &quot;ivermectin&quot;.

The discovery of ivermectin has been described as a combination of &quot;chance and choice.&quot; Merck was looking for a broad-spectrum anthelmintic, which ivermectin is; however, Campbell noted that they &quot;...also found a broad-spectrum agent for the control of ectoparasitic insects and mites.&quot;

Merck began marketing ivermectin as a veterinary antiparasitic in 1981. By 1986, ivermectin was registered for use in 46 countries and was administered massively to cattle, sheep, and other animals. By the late 1980s, ivermectin was the bestselling veterinary medicine in the world. Following its blockbuster success as a veterinary antiparasitic, another Merck scientist, Mohamed Aziz, collaborated with the World Health Organization to test the safety and efficacy of ivermectin against onchocerciasis in humans. They found it to be highly safe and effective, triggering Merck to register ivermectin for human use as &quot;Mectizan&quot; in France in 1987. A year later, Merck CEO Roy Vagelos agreed that Merck would donate all ivermectin needed to eradicate river blindness. In 1998, that donation would be expanded to include ivermectin used to treat lymphatic filariasis.

Ivermectin earned the title of &quot;wonder drug&quot; for the treatment of nematodes and arthropod parasites. Ivermectin has been used safely by hundreds of millions of people to treat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis.

Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Campbell and Ōmura for discovering ivermectin, &quot;the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases&quot;.

==Society and culture==

===COVID-19 misinformation===
===Economics===
The initial price proposed by Merck in 1987 was per treatment, which was unaffordable for patients who most needed ivermectin. The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries. Between 1995 and 2010, using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness, the program is estimated to have prevented seven million years of disability at a cost of .

Ivermectin is considered an inexpensive drug. As of 2019, ivermectin tablets (Stromectol) in the United States were the least expensive treatment option for lice in children at approximately , while Sklice, an ivermectin lotion, cost around for .

, the cost effectiveness of treating scabies and lice with ivermectin has not been studied.

=== Brand names ===
It is sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice, and Stromectol in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd. under the trade name Scabo 6. The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold under the brand name Soolantra. While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck.

==Research==

===Parasitic disease===

Ivermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis and trypanosomiasis.

Ivermectin has also been tested on zebrafish infected with &quot;Pseudocapillaria tomentosa&quot;.

===Tropical diseases===

Ivermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself and the mosquitos that carry it. A direct effect on malaria parasites could not be shown in an experimental infection of volunteers with &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy or safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria. Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin to treat and prevent nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby potentially reducing infection with residual malaria parasites. Whilst effective in killing malaria-bearing mosquitos, a 2021 Cochrane review found that, to date, the evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin. 

One alternative to ivermectin is moxidectin, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in people with river blindness. Moxidectin has a longer half-life than ivermectin and may eventually supplant ivermectin as it is a more potent microfilaricide, but there is a need for additional clinical trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential.

There is tentative evidence that ivermectin kills bedbugs, as part of integrated pest management for bedbug infestations. However, such use may require a prolonged course of treatment which is of unclear safety.

===NAFLD===
In 2013, ivermectin was demonstrated as a novel ligand of the farnesoid X receptor, a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

===COVID-19===

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin was researched for possible utility in preventing and treating COVID-19, but no good evidence of benefit was found.

== Veterinary use ==
Ivermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel, and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs that leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures. Ivermectin is only effective in killing some of these parasites, because of an increase in anthelmintic resistance. This resistance has arisen from the persistent use of the same anthelmintic drugs for the past 40 years. Additionally, the use of Ivermectin for livestock has a profound impact on dung beetles, such as &quot;T. lusitanicus&quot;, as it can lead to acute toxicity within these insects.

In dogs, ivermectin is routinely used as prophylaxis against heartworm. Dogs with defects in the P-glycoprotein gene (&quot;MDR1&quot;), often collie-like herding dogs, can be severely poisoned by ivermectin. The mnemonic &quot;white feet, don&#x27;t treat&quot; refers to Scotch collies that are vulnerable to ivermectin. Some other dog breeds (especially the Rough Collie, the Smooth Collie, the Shetland Sheepdog, and the Australian Shepherd), also have a high incidence of mutation within the &quot;MDR1&quot; gene (coding for P-glycoprotein) and are sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin. For dogs, the insecticide spinosad may have the effect of increasing the toxicity of ivermectin.

A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating ear mites in cats is available. Clinical evidence suggests 7-week-old kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity.

Ivermectin is sometimes used as an acaricide in reptiles, both by injection and as a diluted spray. While this works well in some cases, care must be taken, as several species of reptiles are very sensitive to ivermectin. Use in turtles is particularly contraindicated.

A characteristic of the antinematodal action of ivermectin is its potency: for instance, to combat &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot; in dogs, ivermectin is effective at 0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight when administered orally.

<doc id="1117433" wikidata="Q4777515" url="?curid=1117433" title="Antzitene">
<text>Antzitene or Anzitene (, ) was a region of the medieval Armenia c. 300–1000, known in Armenian as Hanzith and in Syriac as Hanzit. Today it lies in Turkey.

From 384, it formed one of the satrapies of Roman Armenia, before becoming part of the new province of &quot;Armenia IV&quot; in 536. In the 10th century the rulers were Habel (c. 970) and Sahak (c. 995).

Located at the southwestern corner of Armenia, it was bordered by the Arsanias river on the north, the Euphrates on the west, and the slopes of the Armenian Taurus on the south and southeast. The geographic core of Anzitene was the plains region stretching from modern-day Elazığ to the ancient city of Arsamosata. Now called Altınova, or &quot;golden plain&quot;, this is a fertile and well-watered region surrounded by mountains. According to a local tradition recorded in the 19th century, it was the site of the ancient Garden of Eden. Anzitene also included areas on the east bank of the Euphrates, around Muşar and Tomisa (Kömür Han), in what is geographically part of the Malatya plain instead.

Anzitene controlled the southern of the two main east-west routes through the Armenia. The first one went from Melitene in the west, crossed the Euphrates at Tomisa, and then followed the Arsanias valley up to its headwaters in the lava country north of Lake Van. It also commanded the Ergani Pass - one of two main routes over the Armenian Taurus, linking the Armenian plateau with the rich upper Tigris valley. It also controlled several lesser-important routes. One went northwest towards northern Anatolia, crossing the Arsanias at the Aşvan ford and then the Euphrates near Ağın. Another went north to the upper Euphrates valley, crossing the Arsanias at the Pertek ford and then crossing the high, bare Mouzouron range.

Given its strategic position, Anzitene was often contested between major empires during late antiquity and the early middle ages. It was just beyond the Roman Empire&#x27;s frontier on the Euphrates until 297, when it was annexed by Diocletian. It then formed a buffer zone protecting Roman Melitene and also controlled the Romans&#x27; main north-south military route in the region (the Ergani Pass) until Justinian extended Roman rule further east up the Arsanias valley. Then, after the Arab conquest, Anzitene became part a staging point for expeditions against Asia Minor and to control southwestern Armenia. Anzitene was reconquered by the Byzantines in the 930s and they fortified the city of Harput which now rose to prominence and became the main city in the region. Not long after, the Hamdanid ruler Sayf al-Dawla made a famous raid into Anzitene in 956. This was one of his most famous campaigns, and the &quot;remarkably detailed&quot; Arabic prose account of it provides a major source about medieval Anzitene and its settlement patterns.

Classical Anzitene was a prosperous region; its main towns were Dadima (Tadım) and Arsamosata, while many villages dotted the surrounding countryside. However, during the middle ages, Anzitene&#x27;s population appears to have decreased - its location on the frontier during the Arab-Byzantine wars left it vulnerable to attack, and many people migrated north to the relatively more secure district of Sophene.

Today, the construction of the Keban Dam has flooded low-lying parts of old Anzitene along the Arsanias valley, hindering archaeological research of sites there.

== History ==
The name Anzitene corresponds to the &quot;Enzi&quot; of Neo-Assyrian texts.

A document dated to 252 about the sale of a slave named Qardannaea Diane identifies her as being born in the district of Ortene, which based on later Syriac sources appears to be located in Anzitene. The people of Ortene apparently spoke neither Armenian nor Aramaic but rather their own language. (The name &quot;Ortene&quot; has been connected by Markwart to ancient Urartu but this is highly speculative.) However, the fact that Qardannaea had also adopted the name Diane in addition to her native name indicates that the region was under considerable Greco-Roman cultural influence at the time.

In 298, the principality of Anzitene became a Roman subject. As a vassal of the kingdom of Armenia, the princes of Anzitene held the hereditary office of &quot;hazarapet&quot;, perhaps roughly corresponding to a chancellor, for a few generations. They were one of the more important nakharar families (compared to Ingilene which was relatively less important). With the treaty of 363, the kingdom of Armenia changed sides to the Persians, while Anzitene and Sophene remained under Roman allegiance. The prince of Anzitene in 363 when the Persians took over Armenia was named Sałamut. The Armenian sources portray Anzitene and Sophene siding with the Romans as treason against the Armenian king, but in reality Anzitene had already been under Roman influence for over 50 years.

After Arab Melitene surrendered to the Byzantines in 934, Anzitene became briefly divided. Its western highlands abutting Melitene were absorbed into Byzantine territory, forming part of the frontier theme of Mesopotamia, which straddled the Mouzouron range. Eastern Anzitene wasn&#x27;t taken until 937, and then Arsamosata was besieged from 937 to 939. The Byzantines probably expanded the fortifications at Harput around this time. From this point on, Harput became the main center in Anzitene.

Over the next 10 years, the Byzantines continued to expand further east so that by 950, the frontier was well to the east of Anzitene. However, Anzitene vulnerable to attack from across the Armenian Taurus to the south. In 956, the Hamdanid ruler of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, led that exact type of attack into Anzitene. This is one of his most famous campaigns, and the &quot;remarkably detailed&quot; Arabic prose account of it provides a major source about medieval Anzitene and its settlement patterns. This account is found in some manuscripts preceding al-Mutanabbi&#x27;s two poems about the campaign and probably is based on, or directly copied from, an official Hamdanid bulletin sent out by Sayf al-Dawla and/or his military staff who may have recorded the campaign.

The population of Anzitene appears to have declined between the 6th and 10th centuries. Tadım, the late Roman capital of Anzitene, had shrunk and retreated to a more defensible location. Harput also appears to have done the same. The only exception to this trend was Hūrī, which seems to have grown from a village into a town. Part of the reason for this decline may have been because of a movement of population northwards into Sophene. What likely happened is that during the Arab invasions, many people left the &quot;open, exposed settlements&quot; on the Anzitene plain for better-protected places in Sophene. As a &quot;fissured limestone country&quot; protected on the south by the Arsanias river, Sophene was better positioned to shield residents from raids and invasions.

A local population shift also took place within Anzitene, as the people who remained in the district left the open and exposed settlements on the plains for more elevated sites that offered protection. However, there is no evidence that an internal migration took place from the plains to the highlands of western Anzitene. In contrast to Sophene, whose valleys were small but had rich soil for agriculture, the western Anzitene highlands are poorly suited to support large towns.

Meanwhile, the threat of the Byzantines to the west prompted the Arabs to invest in fortifying the northern and western highlands of Anzitene, such as at al-Minşār, al-Tell, and Aşvan. They didn&#x27;t bother to make any bases on the open plains, except for the major city of Arsamosata at the eastern end of the plain.

The Arabs don&#x27;t seem to have used the Ergani pass much during this period. However, an account of Basil I&#x27;s campaign in the region in 873 refers to fortified settlements at include Chachon (Aşağı Huh) and Mourinix (the fort at Daldık, near the village of Murenik), among others. Both sites are on the descent from the Ergani pass, indicating that it was still seen as a strategic military objective, even if less than other periods. In general, the Arabs used Anzitene for a different strategic purpose than supplying Malatya - they used it to maintain communications with regions further east.

When the Byzantines reconquered the region, they made little changes except for upgrading the fortifications at Harput, which now became the main stronghold in Anzitene. They simply reused the existing Arab system, adapting it to serve as a base for the guerilla strategies they typically favored. The resulting system was very defensive in nature, with the castles all at &quot;strong vantage points on the far side of the plain, as if their main function was to shield a highland refuge zone in the west and to control the strategic routes, the main river fords, and the western approach to Arsamosata.&quot; They were not designed to protect the plain. They also didn&#x27;t fortify the Hazar Gölü valley or the mountains separating it from the main Anzitene plain. The Byzantines seem to have treated Anzitene as &quot;a deep outer defensive zone&quot; protecting Melitene on the west and the canton of Sophene, &quot;the economic and social heart of the province of Mesopotamia&quot;, to the north.

Later, Anzitene formed the core of the Artukid principality of Harput, which also extended further east. This principality was initially established shortly after 1090 by a separate Turkish emir named Çubuk, under the authority of the Seljuk statesman Ibn Jahir. In 1113, Çubuk&#x27;s son Mehmet lost the principality to an Artukid named Balak, who then in turn was conquered by a different Artukid, Shams ad-Dawla of Mayyafariqin. The next year, Harput was seized by a third Artukid, Dawud of Hisn Kayfa. In 1176, a younger son of this branch seized Harput and it became an independent principality again until its final conquest by the Seljuk Kayqubad I in 1234. The principality of Harput had not originally included the western part of Anzitene around Minshar, but when Balak married the mother of Tuğrul Arslan, the neighboring Seljuk prince of Malatya, he received Minshar as his dowry and thus reunited Anzitene politically.

Although it was the region&#x27;s main settlement for much of the middle ages, Harput (aka Ziata) was an obscure, purely local stronghold throughout the classical and early medieval periods. Its only claim to fame was that in 359 it was the most important among several minor forts captured by a Persian expedition into Roman territory. It played no major role in the Roman-Sasanian wars of late antiquity, nor in the Arab conquest. It was &quot;not incorporated into the elaborate system of frontier defense laid out by the caliph Harun al-Rashid at the end of the 8th century&quot;. Even as late as Qudama ibn Ja&#x27;far&#x27;s systematic account of the Arab marches facing Byzantium between 928 and 932 it was unmentioned and must have remained purely local in importance. It seems to have first gained significance when the Byzantines conquered Anzitene in the 930s. During the early middle ages, Harput shrank in size. From its larger Roman-era site, with ten-&quot;stadia&quot;-long circuit walls, it &quot;contracted and perhaps retreated to the powerful position occupied by the medieval castle&quot;. In the 10th century, the fortress was expanded to its present size. From this point on, Harput became the main center in Anzitene and the surrounding region in general. Its population grew as the threat of warfare, Turkic raids, and brigandage drove many people to seek safety near its formidable castle.

The main castle apart from Harput in 10th-century Anzitene was Dadima (or Dadimon), at present-day Tadım. It was an important military objective of Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s campaigns of 938 and 956. This castle was the medieval descendant of an important ancient settlement. George of Cyprus, writing in the late 6th century, appears to implicitly label Dadima a city since he does not list it as either a fortress (&quot;kastron&quot;) or a town (&quot;polichne&quot;). He also implies that it had recently been elevated to the provincial capital of Armenia IV, succeeding Martyropolis, the capital under Justinian, after the southern flanks of the Armenian Taurus were detached and made into the new province of Upper Mesopotamia. Dadima remained the ecclesiastical capital of Armenia IV at least through 692, when its bishop Elias signed the canons of the Quinisext Council.

During the period of Arab domination roughly lasting from 640-938, Tadım declined to a small town, leaving Arsamosata the lone major city in the plains region. The reason may have been proximity to danger, with the Arab-Byzantine frontier now lying west of Tadım. Some of its population likely relocated to the Arsamosata area. Sometime after 956, Tadım sank into total obscurity, although its name survives to the present day. As of 1900, remains at Tadım include two traces of circuit walls: one enclosing a tepe 60 feet high, possibly representing the medieval site, and the other 1 mile west on the plain, possibly representing the ancient site.

Some 8 km south of Tadım is Hoh, which as of the 19th century was one of the principal villages on the plain. As of 1900, foundations of an apparently &quot;Roman&quot; or &quot;Byzantine&quot; building were identified atop a tepe 80 feet high and 200 feet in diameter; the tepe was apparently unfortified. Hoh is probably the place called &quot;Hūrī&quot; in the al-Mutanabbi account. (This was first proposed by Canard and accepted by Howard-Johnston &quot;for want of convincing alternatives - but with considerable hesitation&quot;.) Although it is listed as a &quot;balad&quot; or city in the text, it was probably obscure in both classical and medieval times and was probably just a particularly large village, probably unfortified according to Howard-Johnston. On the other hand, Sinclair identifies the site of Aşağı Huh with the fort called &quot;Chachon&quot; that Basil I attacked in 873. In any case, it was probably fortified earlier in its history, since the Armenian Geography attributed to Moses of Chorene in the 6th or 7th century lists a castle called Horē as one of two places in Anzitene canton.

Arsamosata in the northeast was a major city with a mixed Armenian and Assyrian population. It was located at the present-day site of Haraba. The Syriac Orthodox bishop of Anzitene resided at Arsamosata. Tadım&#x27;s decline under Arab rule left Arsamosata as the lone major city in the plains region. Arsamosata likely received an influx of new residents from both Tadım and the Malatya plain. Around the 11th and 12th centuries, however, Arsamosata went into decline, contracting from &quot;a sprawling ancient city&quot; into a smaller city contained within the walls. It remained a city until at least the end of the 12th century - the Syrian Orthodox bishopric is known until 1199 - and was probably inside the old city walls, although not effectively protected by them. After the local garrison was finally withdrawn, perhaps in 1234 when Harput was conquered by the Seljuks, Arsamosata&#x27;s population &quot;dispersed to villages on the plain and nearby hills&quot;.

Other than Arsamosata, the castle of Salām was probably the only major site in the northeastern part of Anzitene at Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s time. A possible identification is the large stronghold of Shitar Kale near İçme, which overlooks the plain from a height of 1000 feet and commands the Arsanias valley. Along with the village of al-Muqaddamiyyah, Salām lay on Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s route from Harput to Arsamosata in 938. The poet Abu Firas refers to a battle &quot;in the district of Salām&quot; at one point, implying that Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s victory over the pursuing Byzantines took place near here.

Sayf al-Dawla never targeted the highlands of northern and western Anzitene, &quot;doubtless deterred by the danger of Byzantine guerrilla action in favorable terrain&quot;, so less is known about this area during the 10th century. Only 3 castles are mentioned in 10th-century sources: Aşvan, al-Tell, and al-Minşār. The castle at Aşvan apparently put up no resistance to Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s forces in 956 - they occupied it without trouble and turned it into a base camp. It stood on the south bank of the Arsanias, at a convenient place for launching boats and rafts, and it controlled a ford. One candidate for its location is the mound called Aşvan Kale above the modern village of Aşvan: it is on the river bank, 4 km upstream from a major ford, and the name is identical. However, excavation of the northern half of the mound revealed no evidence of occupation between 400-1000 - nor any indication that the site was ever fortified during its occupation. Instead, according to James Howard-Johnston, the castle, along with the ancient and medieval town, was probably somewhere on the plain just to the west, immediately by the ford. Here, it would have been better positioned to guard the southern approach to ford on the road from Harput than the more defensible but distant mound above the present-day village. Alluvial action and human quarrying may have removed all visible traces of an early medieval castle. (However, according to Stephen Mitchell&#x27;s hypothesis, there was never a &quot;castle&quot; of &quot;Hisn Aşvan&quot; - rather, there was just a mound called &quot;castle&quot; in the 10th century just the same as it is today.)

Al-Tell castle was probably in the hills west of Tadım, probably no more than 10 km or so away. Sayf al-Dawla sent a detachment to siege al-Tell in 938 while he was besieging Dadima. Canard proposed that al-Tell is the same place as the Tell Arsanas mentioned by Ibn Hawqal; this is accepted by Howard-Johnston &quot;for want of convincing alternatives - but with considerable hesitation&quot;.) The exact location is uncertain, but the coordinates Ibn Hawqal gave for Tell Arsanas would place it about 18 km west of Harput and about 24 km from the Euphrates ford at the village of Hammam. Tell Arsanas would have overlooked the main route southwest from Harput towards the ford at Tomisa. If al-Tell was indeed here, then Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s actions here would have been intended to hold the route and perhaps provide a distraction from his main actions at Tadım and Harput.

The castle of al-Minşār was almost certainly at the large rock by the village of Kale on the mountain called Muşer or Mişar Dağ near the east bank of the Euphrates. This site &quot;had been fashioned into a castle by hewing out platforms and steps and constructing walls in the prehistoric period&quot;. The site is just upstream from a ford on the Euphrates - itself upstream from the main one at Tomisa - which was used by Sayf al-Dawla in 953 to make a rapid retreat when his forces were almost trapped on the opposite bank. There was presumably a minor route running through the Anzitene highlands that he used then.

4 km south-southeast of modern-day Aşvan is the late medieval castle of Taşkun Kale, which is on the northern edge of an upland basin. Anthony McNicoll tentatively dated Taşkun Kale castle and the medieval phase of its nearby church to 14th century and concluded that the settlement around it must have been fairly large given the presence of scattered potsherds and traces of stone walls. The name &quot;Taşkun&quot; is vaguely reminiscent of the ancient Roman border fort of Dascusa - as does the nearby city of al-Ashkūniyyah, a provincial capital across the river from Aşvan.

There is a small castle on a small hill overlooking the village of Keluşağı 12 km west of Tell Arsanas; it should probably be distinguished from al-Tell. It commands a second, more minor route west from Harput which is north of the main one. Based on local accounts of Roman coins being washed out from the spring rains, Huntington assigned this site to the Roman period. It may have also remained in use during the early middle ages.

The ancient settlement of Mazara, whose site is now occupied by the modern city of Elazığ, was a road station on the road linking Melitene to the upper Euphrates basin. After the classical period, it no longer appears in historical records, indicating that it declined to insignificance or was abandoned altogether. A large settlement at the mouth of the Zerteriç valley appears to have been built at some point during classical antiquity. It does not seem to have featured in Sayf al-Dawla&#x27;s campaigns and may have dwindled to a village or been abandoned altogether by the 10th century.

The town of Kalkas mentioned by Ibn Hawqal, which corresponds to the ancient Cholcis, was at the NE end of Hazar Gölü. When Sayf al-Dawla invaded through here in 956, the account makes no mention of him dealing with any Byzantine stronghold, so Kalkas does not appear to have been used as a military base during this period.

<doc id="1117436" wikidata="Q1112128" url="?curid=1117436" title="Vogue (dance)">
<text>Vogue, or voguing, is a highly stylized, modern house dance originating in the late 1980s that evolved out of the Harlem ballroom scene of the 1960s. It is inspired by the poses of models in fashion magazines.

It gained mainstream exposure when it was featured in Madonna&#x27;s song and video &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990), and when showcased in the 1990 documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot; (which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival). In its modern form, this dance has become a global phenomenon that continues to evolve both stylistically and demographically.

== History ==
This style of dance arose from African American Harlem ballroom cultures, as danced by African-American and participating Latino gay men and transfeminine individuals, from the early 1960s through the 1980s. The Harlem Renaissance shaped a distinctly African American and Latino LGBTQ culture in Harlem from 1920 to 1935, which included advancement in literature, arts and music and attempted to demonstrate that aspects of identity like race, gender and sexuality can be fluid and intersecting.

The Balls that began during this time eventually shifted from elaborate pageantry to vogue dance battles. The dance battles consisted of dance learned during prison years. Inspired by the style of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs and the famous images of models in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, voguing is characterized by striking a series of poses as if one is modeling for a photo shoot. Arm and leg movements are angular, linear, rigid, and move swiftly from one static position to another. 

Dance competitions often involved throwing &quot;shade,&quot; or subtle insults directed at one another in order to impress the judges and the audience. The competition style was originally called &quot;presentation&quot; and later &quot;performance.&quot; Over the years, the dance evolved into the more intricate and acrobatic form that is now called &quot;vogue&quot;.

Vogue dance presents gender as a performance. Drag queens pretend to apply makeup (&quot;beat face&quot;), style hair and don extravagant clothing through the dance moves. Depending on the competition category, participants may perform the traditional behaviors of their biological sex to demonstrate &quot;realness,&quot; or passing as straight. Although there are varying gender and sexuality classifications and categories, each fits into either Female Figure (FF) or Male Figure (MF). Female Figure includes trans women, cisgender women and drag queens, while Male Figure includes butch queens, butch women and transgender men. No matter the category, performances and competitions are camp, which embodies the spirit of extravagance and is exaggerated and artificial. 

The precise origins of voguing are disputed. Although many cite the story in which Paris Dupree takes out a Vogue magazine and mimics the poses to the beat of the music (and other queens subsequently followed), there are other accounts that note voguing may have originated from black gay prison inmates at Rikers Island, performed for the attention of other men as well as throwing shade. Voguing is continually being developed further as an established dance form that is practiced in the Black and Latino gay ballroom scene, and clubs in major cities throughout the United States, centered in New York City.

== Styles ==
There are currently three distinct styles of vogue: &quot;Old Way&quot; (pre-1990); &quot;New Way&quot; (post-1990); and &quot;Vogue Fem&quot; (circa 1995).

=== Old way ===
Old way is characterized by the formation of lines, symmetry, and precision in the execution of formations with graceful, fluid-like action. Egyptian hieroglyphs and fashion poses serve as the original inspirations for old way voguing. In its purest, historical form, old way vogue is a duel between two rivals. Traditionally, old way rules dictated that one rival must &quot;pin&quot; the other to win the contest. Pinning involved the trapping of an opponent so that they could not execute any movements while the adversary was still in motion (usually voguing movements with the arms and hands called &quot;hand performance&quot; while the opponent was &quot;pinned&quot; against the floor doing &quot;floor exercises&quot; or against a wall).

=== New way ===
New way is characterized by rigid movements coupled with &quot;clicks&quot; (limb contortions at the joints) and &quot;arms control&quot; (hand and wrist illusions, which sometimes includes tutting and locking). New way can also be described as a modified form of mime in which imaginary geometric shapes, such as a box, are introduced during motion and moved progressively around the dancer&#x27;s body to display the dancer&#x27;s dexterity and memory. New way involves incredible flexibility.

=== Vogue Fem ===
Vogue Fem (&quot;Fem&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;woman&quot;) is fluidity at its most extreme with exaggerated feminine movements influenced by ballet, jazz and modern dance. Styles of Vogue Fem performances range from Dramatics (which emphasizes stunts, tricks, and speed) to Soft (which emphasizes a graceful, beautiful, and easy flow continuations between the five elements). There are currently five elements of Vogue Fem:
* Duckwalk: The duck walk receives its name from the appearance the name references (a duck walking) that involves squatting on the heels and kicking the feet out while moving forward on the beat.
* Catwalk: Catwalking is an exaggerated feminine walk where the legs are crossed over each other, the hips are thrust from side to side, and the hands are thrown forward in opposition to the legs.
* Hands: In performance, the hands of the performer often told a story (demonstrated in the category Hand Performance/Arms Control) This is the component of performing used to throw shade. For example, miming an expression of horror at the way the opponents face looks.
* Floorwork: This component demonstrates the competitors&#x27; sensuality as they roll, twist, and otherwise move on the ground in such a way as to capture the attention of the judges.
* Spins and Dips: The most recognizable feat in Vogue Fem. Dips (also known as death drops) can be described as a ground-level stunt. This can be executed by spiraling down to the floor and tucking one leg, while the other is extended and creating the illusion that one’s head has touched the floor. This is to be executed on what is called the HA! a loud metallic crash in the music or verbal “HA!” heard throughout music to accent this specific movement. The dip originated from Pop, Dip, and Spin which is the foundation and base of Old Way.
== Scenes and chapters ==
The ballroom scene has evolved into a national and international underground dancesport with major balls and dance competitions being held in different regions of the United States and around the world. New York State continues to be the mecca of the ballroom scene as well as the dance style, but regional voguing &quot;capitals&quot; exist—Chicago and Detroit for the Midwest. Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Miami for the South. Los Angeles and Las Vegas for the West Coast. Baltimore, D.C, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh. and Virginia for the East Coast.

International cities in Western Europe (the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Sweden), Eastern Europe, Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama) and Asia Pacific (Japan and New Zealand) have sprouted and held competitions inspired by voguing from the original balls of New York City.

==Influence on pop music==

===Influence on Madonna===
Madonna is commonly credited with popularizing vogue as a dance craze. Due to the popularity of her song &quot;Vogue&quot;, Madonna has often been perceived as the inventor of vogueing, which nevertheless has not remained central to her performance work. MFA Stephen Ursprung from Smith College felt that &quot;Madonna created a market for voguing&quot; and further asserted &quot;voguing has left its mark on the world&quot; through a &quot;close connection&quot; with the singer. 

Danish lecturer Henrik Vejlgaard, commented that both her song and video made &quot;voguing a popular dance concept in many parts of the world&quot;. A 1994 article from academic journal &quot;Public Culture&quot;, said that the gay ball dance form was popularized by Madonna &quot;in a way that made it seem like she practically invented it&quot;. 

Although Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Vogue&quot; brought popularity and awareness to the dance style, the pop singer still received criticism from those who believe she exploited and appropriated the ballroom culture. The 1990 music video was choreographed by Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza and Luis Camacho of the House of Xtravaganza. However, all of the celebrities mentioned in the song are white, and Madonna herself is a white woman. Even though Madonna referenced the Harlem ballroom culture by including members of the community in the production of the video, critics still say that she erased the originating culture since she is the primary mainstream association with the style.

===Further influence ===
Several other notable pop celebrities and artists have been influenced by Voguing, including performers such as Teyana Taylor, Rihanna, Willow Smith, FKA Twigs, Ariana Grande, Beyoncé and Azealia Banks have all taken inspiration from voguing from dances of past and contemporary voguers, while also incorporating the beats traditionally attached to the dance.

One of the most recent influences of voguing (and Ball culture) comes from the documentary film &quot;Kiki&quot;, in which contemporary Balls and Voguing is represented through the scenes and styles that now exist.

<doc id="1117448" wikidata="Q13420360" url="?curid=1117448" title="Barton, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Barton (postcode: 2600) is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. At the , Barton had a population of 1,946 people.

Barton is adjacent to Capital Hill. It contains the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney-General&#x27;s Department, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and several other Commonwealth government departments.

On Kings Avenue is the controversial Edmund Barton Building, which was made a heritage listed building in 2005, but its modernist design has often been criticised.

The boundary of Barton runs along Telopea Park East in the south east. On the east side it surrounds the East Basin of Lake Burley Griffin. In the north east the boundary is Morshead Drive. The boundary continues along Kings Avenue all the way to State Circle. State Circle forms the boundary with Capital Hill to the west. The boundary then extends along the centre of Sydney Avenue, and finally along New South Wales Crescent back to Telopea Park.

==History==

Settlement of Barton began in 1922. The first stage of the heritage-listed Barton Housing Precinct began in 1926 and 1927. It was named after Sir Edmund Barton, the father of the White Australia Policy, in 1928. Streets in Barton are named after Governors.

The following areas are heritage listed:

*The Barton Housing Precinct, bounded by Macquarie and Darling streets and Telopea Park, Batman and Currong streets, excluding Brassey Hotel (separately listed), which was built part of John Sulman&#x27;s &quot;initial city&quot; at Kingston prior to the construction of the current city centre. The first houses were constructed between 1926 and 1927 to meet the urgent need for housing for public servants for the opening of the new Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. The precinct also contains privately built houses designed by early local architects Mitchell, Sproule and Oliphant.
* The Brassey Hotel, which was completed in 1927 by the Federal Capital Commission in an American Colonial Revival style. The Heritage Council states that &quot;with its garden setting and axial placement at the end of Belmore Gardens,&quot; it makes a &quot;major contribution to the urban environment&quot; of the area.
* The Hotel Kurrajong, which was designed by John Smith Murdoch in the garden pavilion style. It often provided housed politicians, especially from the ALP, for half a century and is particularly noted for being the place of Ben Chifley&#x27;s death.
*Telopea Park School, which was designed by John Smith Murdoch in 1922 and opened on 11 September 1923 and has had many subsequent extensions and modifications.
*Telopea Park, which was first planted by Thomas Weston in 1923.

The former Patent Office and the Edmund Barton building are outside the jurisdiction of the ACT Heritage Council but are recognised and protected in the Commonwealth Heritage List.

==Suburb amenities==

Barton mainly contains government or national institutions and so has few commercial areas such as shops. Barton contains the ACT Hospice, named Clare Holland House and located at the east end of Lake Burley Griffin. On Blackall Street is St Mark&#x27;s National Theological Centre, a partner in Charles Sturt University School of Theology. The Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture is located next to St Mark&#x27;s. The Australian Federal Police College is on Brisbane Avenue. Telopea Park School is on New South Wales Crescent.

Brassey Hotel was named after Sir Thomas Brassey, Governor of Victoria. It was originally a guest house for mid level government officials and for Members of Parliament.

The Hotel Kurrajong, favored by Ben Chifley and the location of his death in 1951, is also located in the suburb. It is now occupied by the Australian International Hotel School.

Parks in Barton include Telopea Park, York Park, Bowen Park which is on the south shore of Lake Burley Griffin, and Grevillea Park on the north side of the lake.

<doc id="1117450" wikidata="Q752364" url="?curid=1117450" title="History of Kosovo">
<text>The history of Kosovo dates back to pre-historic times when the Starčevo culture, Vinča culture, Bubanj-Hum culture, and Baden culture were active in the region. Since then, many archaeological sites have been discovered due to the abundance of natural resources which gave way to the development of life.

In antiquity the area was part of the Kingdom of Dardania. It was annexed by the Roman Empire toward the end of the 1st century BC and incorporated into the province of Moesia. In the Middle Ages, the region became part of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantine Empire and the Serbian mediaeval states. In 1389 the Battle of Kosovo was fought between a coalition of Balkan states and the Ottoman Empire, resulting in a Serbian decline and eventual Ottoman conquest in 1459.

Kosovo&#x27;s modern history can be traced to the Ottoman Sanjak of Prizren, of which parts were organised into Kosovo Vilayet in 1877. This was when Kosovo was used as the name of the entire territory for the first time. In 1913 the Kosovo Vilayet was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia, which in 1918 formed Yugoslavia. Kosovo gained autonomy in 1963 under Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s direction. This autonomy was significantly extended by Yugoslavia&#x27;s 1974 Constitution, but was lost in 1990. In 1999 UNMIK stepped in. On 17 February 2008, representatives of the people of Kosovo unilaterally declared Kosovo&#x27;s independence and subsequently adopted the Constitution of Republic of Kosovo, which came into effect on 15 June 2008.

==Prehistory==
In prehistory, the succeeding Starčevo culture, Vinča culture, Bubanj-Hum culture, Baden culture were active in the region. The area in and around Kosovo has been inhabited for nearly 10,000 years. During the Neolithic age, Kosovo lay within the areal of the Vinča-Turdaş culture which is characterised by West Balkan black and grey pottery. Bronze and Iron Age tombs have been found in Rrafshi i Dukagjinit.

The favourable Geo-strategic position, as well as abundant natural resources, were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archaeological heritage. The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout Kosovo but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo.

The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the Stone Age Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the Radivojce Cave set near the spring of the Drin river, then there are some indications at Grnčar Cave in the Viti municipality, Dema and Karamakaz Caves of Peja and others. However, life during the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven. Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and Mesolithic man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to mediaeval time are visible throughout its territory, whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.

Vlashnjë and Runik are two of the most significant Neolithic sites which have been found and excavated in a series of expeditions. Vlashnjë is a multi-layered settlement and site area. Archaeological excavations have identified habitation and use of the area since the Neolithic era. The rock art paintings at &quot;Mrrizi i Kobajës&quot; (late Neolithic-early Bronze Age) are the first find of prehistoric rock art in Kosovo. In late antiquity, Vlashnja was a fortified settlement part of the fortification network which Justinian I rebuilt along the White Drin in Dardania. Crkvina near Miokovci, Serbia and Runik have been identified as the two oldest settlements of the Starčevo culture. They are statistically indistinguishable to each other and have been dated to ca. 6238 BC (6362–6098 BC at 95% CI) and ca. 6185 BC (6325–6088 BC at 95% Cl).

==Antiquity==
During the Neolithic age, Kosovo lay within the area of the Vinča-Turdaş culture, Starčevo and Baden culture, which is characterised by West Balkan black and grey pottery. Bronze and Iron Age tombs have been found only in Rrafshi i Dukagjinit which is located in Kosovo.
In classical antiquity, the area of Kosovo was part of Dardania. The name comes from the Dardani, a tribe that lived in the region and formed the Kingdom of Dardania in the 4th century BC. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania (present-day Kosovo), while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania (present-day south-eastern Serbia). The eastern parts of the region were at the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone. Thracian names are absent in western Dardania; some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. The correspondence of Illyrian names – including those of the ruling elite – in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a &quot;thracianisation&quot; of parts of Dardania. The Dardani became one of the most powerful Illyrian states of their time under their king Bardylis. Under the leadership of Bardylis, the Dardani defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times, reigning over upper Macedonia and Lynkestis. Bardylis also led raids against Epirus. Along with the Ardiaei and Autariatae, the Dardani are mentioned in Roman times by ancient Greek and Roman sources as one of the three strongest &quot;Illyrian&quot; peoples

In addition, an ancient funeral inscription of the Albanoi was found near Skopje, corresponding to the ancient Dardania region.

In 1854, Johann Georg von Hahn was the first to propose that the names Dardanoi and Dardania were related to the Albanian word (&quot;pear, pear-tree&quot;), stemming from Proto-Albanian &quot;*dardā&quot;, itself a derivative of , &quot;to tip out, pour&quot;, or &quot;*derda&quot; in Proto-Albanian. A common Albanian toponym with the same root is Dardha, found in various parts of Albania, including Dardha in Berat, Dardha in Korça, Dardha in Librazhd, Dardha in Puka, Dardhas in Pogradec, Dardhaj in Mirdita, and Dardhës in Përmet. Dardha in Puka is recorded as Darda in a 1671 ecclesiastical report and on a 1688 map by a Venetian cartographer. Dardha is also the name of an Albanian tribe in the northern part of the District of Dibra.

The region of Illyria was conquered by Rome in 168 BC, and made into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. The Kosovo region probably became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87, although archaeological evidence suggests that it may have been divided between Dalmatia and Moesia.

After 284 Diocletian further divided Upper Moesia into the smaller provinces of Dardania, Moesia Prima, Dacia Ripensis, and Dacia Mediterranea. Dardania&#x27;s capital was Naissus, previously a Celts settlement. The Roman province of Dardania included eastern parts of modern Kosovo, while its western part belonged to the newly formed Roman province of Prevalitana with its capital Doclea. The Romans colonised the region and founded several cities.


The Hunnic invasions of 441 and 447–49 were the first barbarian invasions that were able to take Eastern Roman fortified centres and cities. Most Balkan cities were sacked by Attila, and recovered only partially if at all. While there is no direct written evidence of Hunnic invasion of Kosovo, its economic hinterland will anyway have been affected for centuries. Justinian I, who assumed the throne of the Byzantine Empire in 527, oversaw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories, and re-absorbed the area of Kosovo into the empire.

===Slavic migrations===

Slavic migrations to the Balkans took place between the 6th to 7th centuries. The region had been part of the Roman and Byzantine empires until the first major Slav raids took place in the middle of Justinian&#x27;s reign. In 547 and 548 the Slavs invaded the territory of modern Kosovo, and then got as far as Durrës on the Northern Albanian coast and reached all the way down to Greece. The overwhelming number of municipalities in modern-day Kosovo being Slavic in their toponymy suggests that these Slavic raiders either assimilated, or expelled the local non-Slavic populations inhabiting the region of Kosovo prior to their arrival. The plague of Justinian had killed millions of native Balkan people and as a result many regions had become depopulated and neglected by the government.

According to some historians, although some Slavs did spread out through these areas, there is one intriguing argument that suggests Slavic settlement in Kosovo and the Southern Morava Valley was weak in the first one or two centuries of Slavic settlement. According to some historians and linguists, if Slavs had spread evenly in this part of the Balkans it would be hard to explain the clear linguistic division that occurred between the Bulgarian-Macedonian and Serbo-Croat language. The scholar who first proposed this theory also noticed in the area that divided the early Serbs and the Bulgarians many Latin place-names in these areas survived long enough to be eventually adapted into Slavic ones, such as Naissus (Nis), Lypenion (Lipljan), Scupi (Skopje) etc.

According to De Administrando Imperio, the ancestors of Serbs and Croats were part of the Slavic migrations into the Balkans, the Croats settled in modern Croatia and Western Bosnia whereas the Serbs in the rest of Bosnia, Travunija, Zahumlje and Duklja, lands situated North-West of Kosovo.

==Middle Ages==

According to historian Noel Malcolm, the Vlach-Romanian and Aromanian languages originated in the region and surrounding areas from Romanised Illyrians and Thracians. It was possibly a contact zone between the Albanian and Romanian language.

The region of Kosovo was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Presian (836–852). It remained within the borders of Bulgaria for 150 years until 1018, when it was retaken by the Byzantine Empire under Basil II (r. 976–1025) after half a century of campaigning. According to &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; of the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Serbian-populated lands lay to the north-west of Kosovo and the region was Bulgarian. One of the historical cities of Kosovo, Prizren is mentioned for the first time in 1019 in the form of &quot;Prisdriana&quot;. In 1072, the leaders of the Bulgarian Uprising of Georgi Voiteh traveled from their center in Skopje in the area of Prizren and held a meeting in which they invited Mihailo Vojislavljević of Duklja to send them assistance. Mihailo sent his son, Constantine Bodin with 300 of his soldiers. Dalassenos Doukas, dux of Bulgaria was sent against the combined forced but was defeated near Prizren, which was extensively plundered by the Serbian army after the battle. The Bulgarian magnates proclaimed Bodin &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot; after this initial victory. They were defeated by Nikephoros Bryennios in the area of northern Macedonia by the end of 1072. After the Byzantine Empire fully re-established itself, the region became part of the Byzantine Empire again and stayed under Byzantine rule until the 12th century. 

Stefan Nemanja had seized the surrounding area along the White Drin in 1185–95 and the ecclesiastical split from the Patriarchate in 1219 was the final act of establishing Nemanjić rule in Prizren and Kosovo. Prizren and its fort were the administrative and economic center of the župa of Podrimlje (in Albanian, Podrima or Anadrini). Demetrios Chomatenos is the last Byzantine archbishop of Ohrid to include Prizren in his jurisdiction until 1219. Kosovo was fully annexed by Serbia during this period and was part of the Serbian Empire (1346-1371). From the mid-13th century to the end of the century, the Nemanjić rulers had their main residences in Kosovo. Large estates were given to the monasteries in Western Kosovo (Metohija). The most prominent churches in Kosovo – the Patriarchate of Peć at Peja, the church at Gračanica and the monastery at Visoki Dečani near Deçan – were all founded during this period. Kosovo was economically important and mining was an important industry in Novo Brdo and Janjevo which had its communities of émigré Saxon miners and Ragusan merchants. In 1450 the mines of Novo Brdo were producing about 6,000 kg of silver per year. The ethnic composition of Kosovo&#x27;s population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and Vlachs along with a token number of Greeks, Croats, Armenians, Saxons, and Bulgarians, according to Serbian monastic charters or &quot;chrysobulls&quot;.


Dušan&#x27;s empire was multinational, with the three most important groups being Serbians, Albanians and Greeks. Different laws applied in the Serbian and Greek territories under Dušan&#x27;s control, but the Albanians were largely left to manage their lands according to their traditional customs under the leadership of their chiefs.
However his policies soon changed, and the laws against the Albanians became much harsher with Albanian Catholics being forcibly converted into Orthodoxy. A large numbers of Albanians were forced to migrate towards Greece during this period leaving empty villages behind, which were then taken by Slavic settlers. Many Albanian Catholic churches were converted into Orthodox ones.

In 1355, the Serbian state fell apart on the death of Tsar Stefan Dušan and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. This enabled Albanian chieftains to create small principalities who had revolted several times with the aid of the Catholic Western powers. The First Battle of Kosovo occurred on the field of Kosovo Polje on June 28, 1389, when the ruling &quot;knez&quot; (prince) of Serbia, Lazar Hrebeljanović, marshalled a coalition of Christian soldiers led by Serbs that also included Bosnians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Magyars and a troop of Saxon mercenaries. Sultan Murad I also gathered a coalition of soldiers and volunteers from neighbouring countries in Anatolia and Rumelia. Although the battle has been mythologised as a great Christian defeat, at the time opinion was divided as to whether it was a Christian defeat, a stalemate or possibly even a Christian victory. Murad I was killed, according to tradition by Miloš Obilić, or Kobilić as he was always called until the 18th century. Serbian principalities continued their existence, usually as vassals of the Ottomans, and maintained sporadic control of Kosovo, until the final extinction of the Despotate of Serbia in 1459, following which Serbia became part of the Ottoman Empire. The fortress of Novo Brdo, important at the time due to its rich silver mines, came under siege for forty days by the Ottomans during that year, capitulating and becoming occupied by the Ottomans on June 1, 1455. The Battle of Kosovo of 1389 had completely disorganised the Serb state, and left the field open to the most dynamic local lords, including among them the Albanian princes of the North and the Northeast. One of them was Gjon Kastrioti, the father of Skanderbeg, from the high region of Mati. At the end of the fourteenth and the start of the fifteenth century he managed to carve a principality from Ishmi to Prizren at the heart of region of Kosovo. Part of western Kosovo was part of the Albanian principality of Dukagjini after which western Kosovo is known in Albanian as &quot;Dukagjin&quot;. 

Stefan Lazarević, Lazar&#x27;s son, became a loyal ally of Bayezid, and contributed significant forces to many of Bayezid&#x27;s future military engagements, including the Battle of Nicopolis, where Vuk Branković another Serbian magnate who ruled in parts of Kosovo had joined the anti-Ottoman coalition. As a reward for his contribution to the Ottoman victory, Lazarević was given a large part of Branković&#x27;s lands, including the lands he held in Kosovo (1396-97). Branković himself died as an Ottoman prisoner, although in all later &quot;Kosovo myth&quot; narratives first created by Stefan Lazarević, he is portrayed as a betrayer of the Christians. The Second Battle of Kosovo was fought over two days in October 1448, between a Hungarian force led by John Hunyadi and an Ottoman army led by Murad II. John Hunyadi joined forces with Albania&#x27;s Skanderbeg. The Albanian army under Skanderbeg was delayed as it was prevented from linking with Hunyadi&#x27;s army by the Ottomans and their allies. It is believed that the Albanian army was delayed by Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. The Serbs had declined joining Hunyadi&#x27;s forces following an earlier truce with the Turks. As a result, Skanderbeg ravaged Brankovic&#x27;s domains as punishment for the Serbian desertion of the Christian cause. After Mehmed&#x27;s death in 1421, Lazarević was one of the vassals who strongly supported the coalition against the future Mehmed the Conqueror who ultimately prevailed. This move led Mehmed to punish the Serbian and all other vassals who supported the other claimants to the throne by campaigning against them to directly annex their lands.

===Ottoman Period===



Western Kosovo had a significant reservoir of a native Albanian population by the time of the full Ottoman take over. According to Malcolm, a major part of the Albanian demographic growth was the expansion of an indigenous Albanian population within Kosovo itself.

While Serbian scholars may have come to the conclusion that the defter from 1455 indicates an overwhelmingly Serbian local population, other scholars have other views. Madgearu instead argues that the series of defters from 1455 onward &quot;shows that Kosovo ... was a mosaic of Serbian and Albanian villages&quot;, while Prishtina and Prizren already had significant Albanian Muslim populations.

The Ottoman officials noted which heads of families were new arrivals in their places of residence; in the Sanjak of Prizren in 1591 only five new arrivals out of forty-one bore Albanian names. In the nahiye of Pec in 1485, the majority of new arrivals had Slavic names. In several Kosovo towns in the 1580s and 1590s; twenty five new Albanian immigrants were recorded and 133 immigrants with Slav names, several of them described coming from Bosnia.

In 1557 the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was re-established and many new Orthodox churches were built. Orthodox Serbs gained the status of Millet, a religious community that enjoyed high levels of autonomy. By the time the Patriarchate had been re-established in 1557 at Peja, the town of Peja may have gained a majority Muslim population. The growth of Islam in early Ottoman Kosovo was mostly urban and from native people in the region converting to Islam.

According to Frederick Anscombe, the town of Gjakova was Albanian since its founding in the late 1500s. Antonio Bruni, writing in the late 1500s, stated that part of Dardania was inhabited by Albanians. Lazaro Soranzo wrote of Albanians who lived as Catholics in the 1500s and noted that they inhabited the city of Prizren. Catholic bishop Pjetër Mazreku noted in 1624 that the Catholics of Prizren were 200, the Serbs (Orthodox) 600, and Muslims, almost all of whom were Albanians, numbered 12,000. In his 1662 work, Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi noted that the residents of Vushtrri were mostly Albanians. Celebi described Western and parts of Central Kosovo as inhabited by Albanians. According to sources from 17th century Kosovo, those in Western Kosovo spoke Albanian while those in Eastern Kosovo spoke Serbo-Croatian.

Around the 17th century, there is a mention of some Catholic Albanians moving from the mountains of Northern Albania and into the plains of Kosovo. These families moved because they had fled blood feuds or they had been punished under the Kanun of Lek Dukagjin. However, the number of these people migrating into the area was, compared to the already existing Albanian population in Kosovo, extremely small.

Albanian Catholic Gregor Mazrreku reported in the year 1651 that in Western Kosovo there had previously been many Catholics but converted to Islam in order to avoid taxes and impositions. In Suha Reka where there had been previously 160 Catholic households, all the men had gone over to Islam. Many Catholics in Kosovo also converted to Islam due to lack of priests, pressure from Ottoman authorities and the Orthodox church. The Catholic church in Kosovo was poor and Catholics were pressured to pay taxes to the Orthodox Church. According to Malcolm, compared to the Catholic church, the Serbian Orthodox church was larger, richer, more established and more privileged which led to less conversion to Islam.

====Kosovo in the Great Turkish War (1683-1699)====
In 1689 during the Austrian-Ottoman wars, the Albanian Catholic Pjeter Bogdani organised a pro-Austrian movement and a resistance against the Ottomans in Kosovo together with the Albanian Catholic Toma Raspasani that included both Muslims and Christians. An English embassy in Istanbul in 1690 reported of Austrians having made contact with 20,000 Albanians in Kosovo that had turned their weapons against the Turks. A great deal of Albanians and Serbs alike joined the Austrians, while others fought on the side of the Ottomans. Ultimately the Austrians were driven back through the Danube, resulting in an influx of refugees and atrocities against the civilian population. Toma Raspasani, writing in 1693 about the Catholics of Kosovo, observed that many of them had gone to Budapest where most of them died, some of hunger, others of disease.

====Aftermath====
Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojević travelled to Belgrade which had been under Austrian rule and led 30,000 - 40,000 refugees to Hungary. According to Malcolm, most of the refugees that had gathered were from Niš and Belgrade area, along with a smaller number of Serb refugees from Eastern Kosovo that had managed to escape. This event is known as the Great Migrations of the Serbs. Malcolm believes that the historical evidence does not support a sudden mass exodus of Serbs out of Kosovo in 1690. If the Serb population was depleted in 1690, it looks as if it must have been replaced by inflows of Serbs from other areas. Such flows did happen and from many different areas. There was also a migration of Albanians from the Malsi but these were slow, long-term processes rather than involving sudden surges of population into a vacuum.

==Modern==
During the period of Ottoman rule, several administrative districts known as sanjaks (&quot;banners&quot; or districts) each ruled by a &quot;sanjakbey&quot; (roughly equivalent to &quot;district lord&quot;) have included parts of the territory. Despite the imposition of Muslim rule, large numbers of Christians continued to live and sometimes even prosper under the Ottomans. A process of Islamisation began shortly after the beginning of Ottoman rule but it took a considerable amount of time – at least a century – and was concentrated at first on the towns. A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. Christian religious life nonetheless continued, while churches were largely left alone by the Ottomans, but both the Serbian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches and their congregations suffered from high levels of taxation.

From the Establishment in 1757 until its dissolution following a War with the Ottomans in 1831, most of Kosovo was ruled by the Pashalik of Scutari and its Albanian dynasty under Kara Mahmud Pasha. He conquered parts of Southern Albania and much of Kosovo.

In 1877 the Vilayet of Kosovo was formed by the Ottoman administration. This was when Kosovo was used as the name of the entire territory for the first time, a derivation from the Serbian word &quot;Kos&quot; (which means black bird). It is shortened from Kosovo Polje meaning &quot;Field of the Blackbirds&quot;, where the Battle of Kosovo of 1389 was fought.

The vilayet was one of four with Albanian inhabitants that formed the League of Prizren. The League&#x27;s purpose was to resist both Ottoman rule and incursions by the newly emerging Balkan nations.

In 1910, an Albanian insurrection, which was possibly aided surreptitiously by the Young Turks to put pressure on the Sublime Porte, broke out in Pristina and soon spread to the entire vilayet of Kosovo, lasting for three months. The Sultan visited Kosovo in June 1911 during peace settlement talks covering all Albanian-inhabited areas.

===Albanian National Movement===

The Albanian national movement was inspired by various factors. Besides the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against the Slavic monarchies of Europe. During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 49,000 and 130,000 Albanians were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Niș and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet and Macedonia. Furthermore, the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano marked the beginning of a difficult situation for the Albanian people in the Balkans, whose lands were to be ceded from Turkey to Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.

Fearing the partitioning of Albanian-inhabited lands among the newly founded Balkan kingdoms, the Albanians established their League of Prizren on June 10, 1878, three days prior to the Congress of Berlin that would revise the decisions of San Stefano. Though the League was founded with the support of the Sultan who hoped for the preservation of Ottoman territories, the Albanian leaders were quick and effective enough to turn it into a national organisation and eventually into a government. The League had the backing of the Italo-Albanian community and had well developed into a unifying factor for the religiously diverse Albanian people. During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an Albanian vilayet within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of Ymer Prizreni, assisted by prominent ministers such as Abdyl Frashëri and Sulejman Vokshi. Nevertheless, military intervention from the Balkan states, the Great Powers as well as Turkey divided the Albanian troops in three fronts, which brought about the end of the League.

Kosovo was yet home to other Albanian organisations, the most important being the League of Peja, named after the city in which it was founded in 1899. It was led by Haxhi Zeka, a former member of the League of Prizren and shared a similar platform in quest for an autonomous Albanian vilayet. The League ended its activity in 1900 after an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces. Zeka was assassinated by a Serbian agent in 1902 with the backing of the Ottoman authorities.

===Balkan Wars===


The demands of the Young Turks in early 20th century sparked support from the Albanians, who were hoping for a betterment of their national status, primarily recognition of their language for use in offices and education. In 1908, 20,000 armed Albanian peasants gathered in Ferizaj to prevent any foreign intervention, while their leaders, Bajram Curri and Isa Boletini, sent a telegram to the sultan demanding the promulgation of a constitution and the opening of the parliament.

The Albanians did not receive any of the promised benefits from the Young Turkish victory. Considering this, an unsuccessful uprising was organised by Albanian highlanders in Kosovo in February 1909. The adversity escalated after the takeover of the Turkish government by an oligarchic group later that year. In April 1910, armies led by Idriz Seferi and Isa Boletini rebelled against the Turkish troops, but were finally forced to withdraw after having caused many casualties amongst the enemy.

A further Albanian rebellion in 1912 was the pretext for Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria beginning the First Balkan War against the Ottoman Empire. Most of Kosovo was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia, while the region of Metohija () was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro. Kosovo was split into four counties: three being a part of the entity of Serbia (Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija); one of Montenegro (Northern Metohija).

The Albanian revolt of 1912 weakened the Ottoman Empire and resulted in an Albanian victory. This further persuaded other Balkan states that it was time for an anti-Ottoman war. The Ottomans had been so fatally weakened by the Albanian revolt of 1912 that the war was quickly won.

Serbia took advantage of the Albanian rebellion after seeing a weakened Ottoman Empire and annexed Kosovo. The Albanians organised a resistance under the leadership of Isa Boletini. Serbia eventually managed to fight through and suppress the rebels. During the conflicts a number of massacres took place by the Serbian army and paramilitaries. Almost half of Albanian inhabited lands, including Kosovo, were left outside of what then formed as Albania and which were annexed by Montenegro and Serbia.

During this period, the majority of the population of Kosovo was Albanian and did not welcome Serb rule.

According to historian Noel Malcolm, the region was conquered, but not legally annexed, by Serbia in 1912 and remained occupied territory until 1918 when it became part of a Yugoslav kingdom.

Many Albanians still kept resisting Serbian army and fought for the unification of Kosovo with Albania. Both Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi continued fighting. Other well known rebels at the time were Azem Galica, also known as Azem Bejta, and his wife Shote Galica.

===Interbellum Period===

The 1918–1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In 1929, Kosovo was split between the Zeta Banovina in the west with the capital in Cetinje, Vardar Banovina in the southeast with the capital in Skopje and the Morava Banovina in the northeast with the capital in Niš.

Serbian troops attempted to alter the region&#x27;s demographic structure through murders and mass expulsions. Between 1918 and 1945, over 100,000 Albanians left Kosovo

Albanian schools and language were prohibited. Tens of thousands of Serbs were settled in the region and land was confiscated from Albanian villagers.

In 1938, more than 6000 people, in 23 villages, in the Drenica region of Kosovo were deprived of their land
The colonisation had put the Serb population at less than 24% in the start to 38%. It was proposed to bring another
470,000 Serbs and expel 300,000 Albanians but the outbreak of World War II prevented it from being put into effect.

===Second World War===

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins. &quot;We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... All indigenous Serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such, via the Albanian and Italian governments, should be sent to concentration camps in Albania. Serbian settlers should be killed.&quot; Mustafa Kruja, the then Prime Minister of Albania, declared in June 1942. The persecution of Serb and Montenegrin settlers by Albanian collaborationists resulted in thousands killed while between 70,000 and 100,000 were expelled or transferred to concentration camps in Pristina and Mitrovica.

During the New Year&#x27;s Eve between 1943 and 1944, Albanian and Yugoslav partisans gathered at the town of Bujan, near Kukës in northern Albania, where they held a conference in which they discussed the fate of Kosovo after the war. Both Albanian and Yugoslav communists signed the agreement, according to which Kosovo would have the right to democratically decide whether it wants to remain in Albania or become part of Serbia. This was seen as the Marxist solution for Kosovo. The agreement was not respected by Yugoslavia, since Tito knew that Serbia would not accept it. Some Albanians, especially in the region in and around Drenica in central Kosovo revolted against the Yugoslav communists for not respecting the agreement. In response, the Yugoslavs called the rebels Nazi and Fascist collaborators and responded with violence. The Albanian Kosovar military leader Shaban Polluzha, who first fought with Yugoslav partisans but then refused to collaborate further, was attacked and killed. Between 400 and 2,000 Kosovar Albanian recruits of the Yugoslav Army were shot in Bar.

===Yugoslavian Period===


Following the end of the war and the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted the status of an autonomous region of Serbia in 1946 and became an autonomous province in 1963. The Communist government did not permit the return of all of the refugees.

With the passing of the 1974 Yugoslavia constitution, Kosovo gained virtual self-government. The province&#x27;s government has applied Albanian curriculum to Kosovo&#x27;s schools: surplus and obsolete textbooks from Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania were obtained and put into use.

Throughout the 1980s tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the province escalated. The Albanian community favoured greater autonomy for Kosovo, whilst Serbs favoured closer ties with the rest of Serbia. There was little appetite for unification with Albania itself, which was ruled by a Stalinist government and had considerably worse living standards than Kosovo. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots &quot;involving 20,000 people in six cities&quot; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. The demonstrations of March and April 1981 were started by Albanian students in Priština, protesting against poor living conditions and the lack of prospects (unemployment was rampant in the province and most of the university educated ended up as the unemployed). In addition, calls for a separate Albanian republic within Yugoslavia were voiced.

Serbs living in Kosovo were discriminated against by the provincial government, notably by the local law enforcement authorities failing to punish reported crimes against Serbs. The increasingly bitter atmosphere in Kosovo meant that even the most farcical incidents could become &quot;causes célèbres&quot;. When a Serbian farmer, Đorđe Martinović, turned up at a Kosovo hospital with a bottle in his rectum after claiming to have been assaulted in his field by masked men (he later admitted the bottle ended up in his rectum through a mishap during masturbation), 216 prominent Serbian intellectuals signed a petition declaring that &quot;the case of Đorđe Martinović has come to symbolise the predicament of all Serbs in Kosovo&quot;.

Perhaps the most politically explosive complaint levelled by the Kosovo Serbs was that they were being neglected by the Communist authorities in Belgrade. In August 1987, Slobodan Milošević, then a rising politician, visited Kosovo. He appealed to Serb nationalism to further his career. Having drawn huge crowds to a rally commemorating the Battle of Kosovo, he pledged to Kosovo Serbs that &quot;No one should dare to beat you&quot;, and became an instant hero of Kosovo&#x27;s Serbs. By the end of the year Milošević was in control of the Serbian government.

In 1988 and 1989, dominant forces in Serbian politics engaged in a series of moves that became known as the anti-bureaucratic revolution. The leading politicians of Kosovo and the northern province of Vojvodina were sacked and replaced, and the level of autonomy of the provinces started to be unilaterally reduced by the Serbian federal authority. In protest, the Kosovo Albanians engaged in mass demonstrations, and Trepča miners began a hunger strike.

The new constitution significantly reduced the provinces&#x27; rights, permitting the government of Serbia to exert direct control over many previously autonomous areas of governance. In particular, the constitutional changes handed control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies to the Serbian government. It was strongly opposed by many of Serbia&#x27;s national minorities, who saw it as a means of imposing ethnically based centralised rule on the provinces.

The Albanian representatives in provincial government largely opposed the constitutional changes and abstained from ratification in the Kosovo assembly. In March 1989, preceding a final push for ratification, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for due process. When the assembly met to discuss the proposals, tanks and armoured cars surrounded the meeting place. Though the final vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority threshold, it was declared as having passed.

===Kosovo War===

After the constitutional changes, the parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them. Kosovo Albanians refused to participate in the elections and held their own, unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required turnout higher than 50%, the parliament of Kosovo could not be established.

The new constitution abolished the individual provinces&#x27; official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programmes in Albanian. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo was suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including that in Albanian in Kosovo. The constitution made creating privately owned media possible, however their functioning was very difficult because of high rents and restricting laws. State-owned Albanian-language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo. However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is &quot;Koha Ditore&quot;, which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after it published a calendar which was claimed to be a glorification of ethnic Albanian separatists.

The constitution also transferred control over state-owned companies to the Serbian government (at the time, most of the companies were state-owned). In September 1990, up to 12,000 Albanian workers were fired from their positions in government and the media, as were teachers, doctors, and workers in government-controlled industries, provoking a general strike and mass unrest. Some of those who were not sacked quit in sympathy, refusing to work for the Serbian government. Although the sackings were widely seen as a purge of ethnic Albanians, the government maintained that it was simply getting rid of old communist directors.
The old Albanian educational curriculum and textbooks were revoked and new ones were created. The curriculum was basically the same as Serbian and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in Albanian. Education in Albanian was withdrawn in 1992 and re-established in 1994. At the Pristina University, which was seen as a centre of Kosovo Albanian cultural identity, education in Albanian was abolished and Albanian teachers were also sacked en masse. Albanians responded by boycotting state schools and setting up an unofficial parallel system of Albanian-language education.

Kosovo Albanians were outraged by what they saw as an attack on their rights. Following mass rioting and unrest from Albanians as well as outbreaks of inter-communal violence, in February 1990, a state of emergency was declared, and the presence of the Yugoslav Army and police was significantly increased to quell the unrest.

Unsanctioned elections were held in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected Ibrahim Rugova as &quot;president&quot; of a self-declared Republic of Kosovo; however these elections were not recognised by Serbian nor any foreign government. In 1995, thousands of Serb refugees from Croatia settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities.
Albanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital Pristina. Ibrahim Rugova initially advocated non-violent resistance, but later opposition took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA; Alb. &quot;Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës&quot; or &quot;UÇK&quot;).

The KLA launched a guerrilla war and terror campaign, characterised by regular bomb and gun attacks on Yugoslav security forces, state officials and civilians known to openly support the national government, this included Albanians who were non-sympathisers with KLA motives. In March 1998, Yugoslav army units joined Serbian police to fight the separatists, using military force. In the months that followed, thousands of Albanian civilians were killed and more than 10,000 fled their homes; most of these people were Albanian. Many Albanian families were forced to flee their homes at gunpoint, as a result of fighting between national security and KLA forces leading to expulsions by the security forces including associated paramilitary militias. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 460,000 people had been displaced from March 1998 to the start of the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999.

There was violence against non-Albanians as well: UNHCR reported (March 1999) that over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo &quot;have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants&quot; and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia. The Yugoslav Red Cross estimated there were more than 130,000 non-Albanian displaced in need of assistance in Kosovo, most of whom were Serb.
Following the breakdown of negotiations between Serbian and Albanian representatives, under North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) auspices, NATO intervened on March 24, 1999, without United Nations authority. NATO launched a campaign of heavy bombing against Yugoslav military targets and then moved to wide range bombings (like bridges in Novi Sad). A full-scale war broke out as KLA continued to attack Serbian forces and Serbian/Yugoslav forces continued to fight KLA amidst a massive displacement of the population of Kosovo, which most human rights groups and international organisations regarded as an act of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the government forces. A number of senior Yugoslav government officials and military officers, including President Milošević, were subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes. Milošević died in detention before a verdict was rendered.

The United Nations estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 40,000 Albanians fled or were expelled from Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to Albania, the Republic of Macedonia, or Montenegro. Government security forces confiscated and destroyed the documents and licence plates of many fleeing Albanians in what was widely regarded as an attempt to erase the identities of the refugees, the term &quot;identity cleansing&quot; being coined to denote this action. This made it difficult to distinguish with certainty the identity of returning refugees after the war. Serbian sources claim that many Albanians from Macedonia and Albania – perhaps as many as 300,000, by some estimates – have since migrated to Kosovo in the guise of refugees.

===Independence===
The war ended on June 10, 1999, with the Serbian and Yugoslav governments signing the Kumanovo Agreement which agreed to transfer governance of the province to the United Nations. A NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entered the province following the Kosovo War, tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). In the weeks after, as many as 164,000 non-Albanians, primarily Serbs but also Roma, fled the province for fear of reprisals, and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse. The Roma in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted the Serbs during the war. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war as KFOR struggled to restore order in the province.

Large numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes.
Some sources put the figure far lower; the European Stability Initiative estimates the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with another 40,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for. The largest concentration of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo is in the north of the province above the Ibar river, but an estimated two-thirds of the Serbian population in Kosovo continues to live in the Albanian-dominated south of the province.
On March 17 and 18, 2004, unrest in Kosovo led to 19 deaths (11 Kosovo Albanians and 8 Kosovo Serbs), the burning of at least 550 homes and the destruction of 27-35 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in the province after Albanian rioting targeted Serbs. Several thousand more Kosovo Serbs have left their homes to seek refuge in Serbia proper or in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo.

Since the end of the war, Kosovo has been a major source and destination country in the trafficking of women, women forced into prostitution and sexual slavery. The growth in the sex trade industry has been fuelled by NATO forces in Kosovo.

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which ended the Kosovo conflict of 1999. Whilst Serbia&#x27;s continued sovereignty over Kosovo was recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province&#x27;s population sought independence.

The United Nations-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself. In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes &#x27;supervised independence&#x27; for the province. As of early July 2007 the draft resolution, which is backed by the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, has stated that it will not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina.
On 17 February 2008 Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence, and subsequently adopted the Constitution of Republic of Kosovo, which came into effect on 15 June 2008. Some Kosovo Serbs opposed to secession boycotted the move by refusing to follow orders from the central government in Pristina and attempted to seize infrastructure and border posts in Serb-populated regions. There have also been sporadic instances of violence against international institutions and governmental institutions, predominantly in Northern Kosovo (see 2008 unrest in Kosovo).

On July 25, 2011, Kosovan Albanian police wearing riot gear attempted to seize several border control posts in Kosovo&#x27;s Serb-controlled north trying to enforce the ban on Serbian imports imposed in retaliation of Serbia&#x27;s ban on import from Kosovo. It prompted a large crowd to erect roadblocks and Kosovan police units came under fire. An Albanian policeman died when his unit was ambushed and another officer was reportedly injured. Nato-led peacekeepers moved into the area to calm the situation and Kosovan police pulled back. The US and EU criticised the Kosovan government for acting without consulting international bodies.

Some rapprochement between the two governments took place on 19 April 2013 as both parties reached the Brussels Agreement, an agreement brokered by the EU that allowed the Serb minority in Kosovo to have its own police force and court of appeals. The accord was ratified by the Kosovo assembly on 28 June 2013.

In April 2021, Kosovo parliament elected Vjosa Osmani as new president for a five-year term. She was Kosovo&#x27;s seventh president, and the second female president, in the post-war period. Osmani had the backing of the left-wing Self-Determination Movement (Vetevendosje) of Prime Minister Albin Kurti, which won the February 2021 parliamentary election.

In September 2021, Serbs from Kosovo&#x27;s north had blocked two main roads, protesting a ban on cars with Serbian licence plates entering Kosovo without temporary printed registration details. Two interior ministry buildings in northern Kosovo, including a car registration office, were attacked. Serbia began military manoeuvres near the border and started flying military jets above the border crossing. Kosovo&#x27;s NATO mission stepped up patrols near border crossings. On September 30, 2021, an agreement between Kosovo and Serbia was reached to end the stand-off. Kosovo agreed to withdraw police special forces. In late July 2022 tensions flared up again when the Kosovo government declared that Serb-issued identity documents and vehicle licence plates would be invalid, prompting Serbs in North Kosovo to protest by blocking roads. The decision on the part of Kosovo authorities was seen as a reciprocal move given that Kosovo documents are rejected in Serbia. In August, EU-mediated talks resulted in an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo whereby Serbia would abolish special document requirements for Kosovo ID holders and Kosovo would not introduce them for Serbian ID holders. In November, ethnic Serbs resigned en masse from Kosovo state institutions in protest and tensions continued through the end of the year.

<text>Bagrevand (also spelled Bagrewand) was a region of Armenia.

The Old Iranian etymology of the name is disputed. It is either derived from &quot;*bāγa.raivanta&quot; (&quot;rhubarb garden&quot;) or &quot;baga-raēvanta-&quot;, which either means &quot;the rich giver&quot; (Mithra) or &quot;the bounteous God&quot; (Ahura Mazda).

== History ==
It was ruled first by Mamikonians and then, in IX-XI centuries, by the Bagratuni family.

It also had its own diocese, whose bishops probably included the theologian Yeznik of Kolb.

<text>Paul Clayton East (4 August 1946 – 27 February 2023) was a New Zealand politician of the National Party.

==Early life and family==
East was born in Ōpōtiki on 4 August 1946, and was educated at King&#x27;s College, Auckland. He studied at the University of Auckland, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1970, and the University of Virginia, where he completed a Master of Laws degree in 1972.

In 1972, East married Marilyn Kottman, and the couple went on to have three children.

Prior to becoming an MP, East was a lawyer and barrister with East Brewster, a Rotorua-based legal firm, from 1973 to 1978. East also engaged in local politics as a member of the Rotorua City Council, which has now been subsumed into the Rotorua District Council.

== Member of Parliament ==




East was first elected to Parliament in the 1978 election as MP for Rotorua, and retained that seat until he became a list MP in the 1996 elections after losing a face-off for National&#x27;s Rotorua nomination to Max Bradford. In 1990, East was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

East served in a number of ministerial roles, including those of Minister of Defence and Attorney-General in the fourth National government. When Jenny Shipley replaced Jim Bolger as leader of the National Party, East was one of the minority who remained aligned with Bolger.

East was appointed a member of the Privy Council in 1998. In 1999, he resigned from Parliament to take up the position of New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in London. He was replaced in Parliament by Alec Neill, the next candidate on National&#x27;s party list.

=== Attorney-general ===
As attorney-general, East advocated on important international issues, including a case brought before the International Court of Justice in 1995 on behalf of New Zealand against France&#x27;s nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. East also headed the development of an advisory opinion to the UN General Assembly on the legality of nuclear testing in 1995. East was awarded the status of Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) while Attorney-General.

==Outside Parliament==

From 2002, East had been independent chairman of the Charity Gaming Association (CGA), which is the industry organisation for charitable trusts that operate electronic gaming machines (&quot;pokies&quot;) to raise funds for community purposes. In 2008 the CGA&#x27;s members operated 75% of non-club gaming machines in New Zealand and generated $250 million worth of grants for worthwhile community purposes.

In the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, East was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to Parliament and the law.

==Death==
East died in Auckland on 27 February 2023, at the age of 76. Fellow former National MP Chester Borrows also died the same day.

<text>ISO/IEC 6523, &quot;Information technology – Structure for the identification of organizations and organization parts&quot;, is an international standard that defines a structure for uniquely identifying organizations and parts thereof in computer data interchange and specifies the registration procedure to obtain an &quot;International Code Designator (ICD)&quot; value for an identification scheme.

The standard consists of two parts:

Part 1: Identification of organization identification schemes defines a structure for the identification of organizations and parts thereof. The components of this structure are the following:
* an International Code Designator (ICD) that uniquely identifies the authority which issued the code to the organization, up to 4 digits
* an organization identifier, up to a maximum of 35 characters
* an (optional) organization part identifier (OPI), up to a maximum of 35 characters (an &quot;organization part&quot; can be &quot;any kind of entity&quot; within an organization.)
* an (optional) OPI source indicator, 1 digit, specifying who attributed the OPI

Part 2: Registration of organization identification schemes defines the registration procedure for ICD values. This includes:
* the requirements on the registration authority for ICD values.
* the specific procedures for the allocation and deletion of ICD values
* the contents of the register/list of the registered identification schemes
Farance Inc. serves as the Registration Authority for ISO/IEC 6523 on behalf of ISO/IEC.

Further information concerning ISO/IEC 6523 and how to obtain an ICD value can be found at iso6523.info. The page includes contact details for the Registration Authority and a list of allocated ICD values. A similar list is part of PEPPOL documentation.

ISO/IEC 6523 forms the basis of OSI naming under ISO/IEC 8348 OSI protocols. It also forms the 1.3 object identifier (OID) tree.

ICD allows registration of various identification schemes for organizations, locations (GS1 Global Location Number), goods (GS1 Global Trade Item Number), military organizations/activities (Department of Defense Activity Address Code), military suppliers (Commercial and Government Entity code), etc. It has been added to Schema.org as the property iso6523Code.

A widespread standard compliant with ISO 6523 norm is the identifier called &quot;Global Location Number&quot; (GLN), developed by GS1 company members. In B2B exchanges, it is widely used by companies to identify locations or functions within a location (for example a factory, the accounting department of a company, an administration, a warehouse, a delivery address, ...). It has become a key to exchange business messages (orders, invoices, ...) using UN/EDIFACT specifications.

The ebCore Party Id Type Technical Specification was issued by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). It was elaborated by the OASIS ebXML Core Technical Committee and it specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for organization identifiers. It bases upon ISO/IEC 6523, ISO 9735 and ISO 20022.

<text>Filitosa is a megalithic site in southern Corsica, France. The period of occupation spans from the end of the Neolithic era and the beginning of the Bronze Age, until around the Roman times in Corsica.

==Location==

The site lies on road D57, a few hundred metres from the hamlet of Filitosa, west of Sollacaro, in the canton of Petreto-Bicchisano, arrondissement of Sartène, north of Propriano in the Corse-du-Sud &quot;département&quot;. It is located on a hill, overlooking the Taravo valley.

==Site history and features==

The site was discovered in 1946 by the owner of the land, Charles-Antoine Cesari, and brought to the attention of archeologists by the British writer, Dorothy Carrington (see her masterpiece, &quot;Granite Island: Portrait of Corsica&quot;,). Systematic excavations started in 1954 by Roger Grosjean. Finds of arrow heads and pottery date earliest inhabitation to 3300 BC. Around 1500 BC, 2-3 metre menhirs were erected. They have been carved with representations of human faces, armour and weapons. Roger Grosjean thought the menhirs may have been erected to ward off an invasion of a group of people called the &quot;Torréens&quot; (Torreans). However this was unsuccessful: the menhirs were cast down, broken up and reused in some cases as building material by the &quot;Torréens&quot;. The &quot;Torréens&quot; built circular stone structures on the site, known as &quot;torri&quot; (or &quot;torre&quot;), which may have been used as temples. The &quot;torri&quot; are remarkably well preserved. This theory had been disputed by later works of F. De Lanfranchi, M.C. Weiss and Gabriel Camps.

In total, about twenty menhirs of various times were counted in Filitosa. They constitute approximately half of the total staff of these monuments in Corsica.

==Layout==

The site of Filitosa is approached down a track through an ancient olive grove. The first monument to be seen is a rock overhang and surrounding wall. Then the visitor comes upon the central monument. Various hut platforms are all around, and the track leads a further 50m to the Western Monument or &quot;torri&quot;. From there, one can enjoy a view down the hill to a stone alignment of five megaliths, set around the base of a 2000-year-old olive tree. Behind the olive tree is the quarry from which the megaliths were extracted.

<doc id="1117461" wikidata="Q4815884" url="?curid=1117461" title="Atiyah ibn Sa'd">
<text>Atiyah ibn Sa&#x27;d ibn Junādah al-&#x27;Awfi () [died 729] was an early Muslim scholar of Islam. He is regarded as a reliable narrator of &quot;hadith&quot;. An aged supporter of rebels and a Shia notable of the time, a disciple of the companion of Muhammad Jabir ibn Abd Allah al-Ansari and a famous narrator of Hadith, Atiyya ibn Sa&#x27;d Awfi was arrested by Muhammad bin Qasim on the orders of Al-Hajjaj and demanded that he curse Ali on the threat of punishment. Atiyya refused to curse Ali and was punished. While Maclean doesn&#x27;t give the details of the punishment, early historians like Ibn Hajar Al-asqalani and Tabari record that he was flogged by 400 lashes and his head and beard shaved for humiliation and that he fled to Khurasan and returned to Iraq after the ruler had been changed.

==Family background==
Atiyah belonged to the Judaila family of the tribe known as Qays and his patronymic appellation was Abu al-Hasan according to al-Tabari. Atiyah&#x27;s mother was Greek.

==Lifetime and legacy==

=== Arba&#x27;een Walk ===

After the battle of Karbala, the companion of Muhammad, Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari and his disciple Atiyah ibn Sa&#x27;d were the first pilgrims to visit the grave of Hussain ibn Ali in Karbala. Hearing the news of what had happened, they left Medina to pay homage and reached Karbala on the 20th of the Islamic month of Safar. This event has evolved into a religious pilgrimage, known as the Arba&#x27;een, attended by millions of Muslims every year.

=== Revolt of Al-Ash&#x27;ath ===
Atiyah supported the revolt of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and his campaign against al-Hajjāj, the Umayyad viceroy of Iraq under Caliph Al-Walid I. The revolt was suppressed and Ibn al-Ash’ath was killed in 85 AH. after which Atiyah fled to Fars. Al-Hajjāj ordered Muhammad bin Qasim then governor of Fars, to summon Atiyah and demand him to curse Ali, which was a practice used by the Umayyads as a test of loyalty. If Atiyah refused, he was to be flogged four hundred times and his head and beard shaved as humiliation. Al-Tabari narrates that Atiyah refused to curse Ali and he was punished. According to &quot;Chachnama&quot;, he was the commander of the right wing of bin Qasim&#x27;s army after the conquest of Armabil (modern Bela). Modern historians, like Yohanan Friedmann and André Wink, question the historical authenticity of this claim in &quot;Chachnama&quot;. Friedmann writes:-

: &quot;One of the most conspicuous elements of this kind is the large number of warriors and traditionists (scholars of Hadith) who figure in the Chachnama and are absent in other accounts of the conquest&quot;.

Other early historians like Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani and Tabari record that he moved on to Khurasan and returned to Iraq after the ruler had been changed.

=== Khorasan ===
Al-Tabari&#x27;s biography states that Atiyah moved to Khorasan and stayed there during the governorship of Qutayba ibn Muslim. After the accession of Yazid II and the appointment of Umar ibn Hubayra as the Governor of Iraq (in 103 AH / 721–722 CE), he sought permission to return to Iraq. He then moved to Kufa lived there until his death in 111 AH / 729 CE.

==Scholarly impact==
Atiyah ibn Sa&#x27;d is regarded as a reliable transmitter of narrations about Muhammad (hadith) by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani and al-Tabari. In addition, he was a great exegete of the Qur&#x27;an and wrote a commentary on it in five volumes.

He was known to be a shia according to many of the scholars, and his narrations are only accepted if they do not support or have relation to the shia theology.

<doc id="1117476" wikidata="Q1388785" url="?curid=1117476" title="Hippalus">
<text>Hippalus (Ancient Greek: Ἵππαλος) was a Greek navigator and merchant who probably lived in the 1st century BCE. He is sometimes conjectured to have been the captain of the Greek explorer Eudoxus of Cyzicus&#x27; ship.

==Use of monsoon==
The writer of the 1st-century CE &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; credited Hippalus with discovering the direct route from the Red Sea to Tamilakam over the Indian Ocean by plotting the scheme of the sea and the correct location of the trade ports along the Indian coast. Pliny the Elder claimed that Hippalus discovered not the route, but the monsoon wind also called &quot;Hippalus&quot; (the south-west monsoon wind). Most historians have tried to reconcile the reports by stating that knowledge of the monsoon winds was necessary to use the direct route, but the historian André Tchernia explains that Pliny&#x27;s connection between the wind and the navigator was based on common pronunciation: in the Hellenistic era the name of the wind was written as &quot;Hypalus&quot;, only in Roman times the spelling &quot;Hippalus&quot; came into use. The wind had already been known in Hellenistic times and had before been used by Himyarite (Southern Arabian Semites) and Indian sailors to cross the Indian Ocean.

===Significance===
To understand the importance of Hippalus&#x27; discovery we have to know that before him Greek geographers thought that the Indian coast stretched from west to east. Hippalus was probably the first (in the West) to recognize the north–south direction of India&#x27;s west coast. Only someone who has this insight will think crossing the Arabian Sea might be a faster way to south India than following the coastline.

The use of Hippalus&#x27; direct route greatly contributed to the prosperity of trade contacts between the Roman province of Aegyptus and India from the 1st century BCE onwards. From Red Sea ports like Berenice large ships crossed the Arabian Sea to the Malabar coast and Muziris port, Tamil kingdoms of the Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras in present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

==Legacy in science and literature==
In 1935, a crater on the Moon was named after the navigator.

Hippalus is also a prominent character in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s 1969 novel about Eudoxus, &quot;The Golden Wind.&quot; He is also mentioned in the Tamil novel &quot;Veera Yuga Nayagan Vel Paari.&quot;

<text>The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) is the global professional management accounting body, based in the United Kingdom. CIMA offers training and qualification in management accountancy and related subjects. It is focused on accountants working in industry and provides ongoing support and training for members.

CIMA is one of the professional associations for accountants in the UK and Ireland. Its particular emphasis is on developing the management accounting profession. CIMA is the largest and the oldest management accounting body in the world, with 115,000 members and 6,500 CGMA students in 2020.

The Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) qualification has the academic standing of a master&#x27;s degree in the UK (recognised at Level 7 by NARIC).

== History ==

CIMA was formed in March 1919, as the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants, by a group of legal professionals and businessmen who wanted to develop an approach to accounting that would meet the demands of a rapidly changing business world. Industrialisation had led to large scale, complex businesses providing unprecedented challenges in management. Employers needed a new form of in-house accountant to provide, in addition to accounts, better analysis of cost and of operations to inform performance management. The new institute soon gained the backing of leading industrialists including, Lord Leverhulme who became its president.

Advances in technology and globalisation made business ever more complex over the 20th century and the role of the accountant in business became more significant. It expanded to include provision of a wider range of information and the emphasis shifted from accounting to management.

The status of management accounting as a distinct branch of the accounting profession was recognised by the granting of a Royal charter in 1975.

== Activities ==
CIMA operates a standard scheme of qualifying examinations for prospective members. It promotes local education, training and management development operations, and new techniques through its research foundation and the dissemination of management accounting practices through publications and other media related activities. It publishes a monthly journal, supplied free to members and registered students, called &#x27;Financial Management&#x27;.

CIMA is recognised as a professional accounting body for various statutory purposes by UK and various overseas governments. The institute regulates the activities of its members by a code of practice, a discipline committee and a continuing professional development education scheme. Its governing body is its council, comprising members elected from regional branches. Each of the branches has a committee and is responsible for much of the &#x27;grass roots&#x27; activity. Activity such as qualification development is undertaken from the London head office.

In 2011, CIMA left the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB).

In 2012, CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants created the CGMA designation (Chartered Global Management Accountant). The designation recognises the most talented and committed management accountants. The CGMA is the most widely held management accounting designation in the world with more than 150,000 designees; it is educationally equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. The designation is built on extensive global research to maintain the highest relevance with employers and develop the competencies most in demand. CGMA professionals are business strategists who can link the board&#x27;s objectives with those of organisation&#x27;s, guiding critical business decisions and creating sustainable business success.

In 2014, CIMA, with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched the Global Management Accounting Principles. The Principles were endorsed by UK business leaders including Ian King, Chief Executive, BAE Systems and Howard Orme, Director General, Finance &amp; Commercial, Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills. The CGMA Competency Framework was also launched in 2014. The framework shows the range of technical, accounting and finance skills that management accountants need to do their jobs and consists of four knowledge areas: Technical Skills, Business Skills, People Skills and Leadership Skills, all underpinned by Ethics, Integrity and Professionalism.

In 2016, CIMA sponsored the creation of the world&#x27;s first management accounting standard: &quot;Guide to management accounting principles&quot;. The standard, published by the British Standards Institute codifies a universal framework for best practice in decision making. Organisations including Sky, The Environment Agency, Fujitsu, the NHS and Siemens had input into its development. It is designed as a best-practice guide to management accounting, allowing organisations to benchmark their finance function and unlock the full contribution that management accountancy can make. The specification is based on the Global Management Accounting Principles, created in 2014 by CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

In 2017, members of CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) formed the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants to unite and strengthen the accounting profession globally.

== Membership ==
CIMA has two grades of full membership:
* Associate – designated by the letters ACMA
* Fellow – designated by the letters FCMA

A CIMA Associate or Fellow is permitted to use the suffix letters ACMA or FCMA together with CGMA (Chartered Global Management Accountant) after their name.

To be admitted as an Associate, a candidate must have: 
* completed a period of qualifying practice of at least three years, documented and signed by appropriate witnesses,
* passed the institute&#x27;s 16 qualifying examinations (or have a verified exemption), including 3 integrated case study exams under 2019 syllabus.

To become a Fellow, a candidate ACMA must, in addition, have appropriate experience at a senior level.

In the past, CIMA has offered forms of association that do not amount to full membership, for example, an &quot;Affiliate&quot; membership class was promoted in the 1970s.

<text>Leuchars (pronounced or ; &quot;rushes&quot;) is a town and parish near the north-east coast of Fife in Scotland.

The civil parish has a population of 5,754 (in 2011) and an area of .

==History==
The name of the town derives from the Scottish Gaelic, &quot;Luachair&quot;, meaning &quot;rushes&quot;, with an archaic Gaelic suffix &quot;-es&quot; that means &quot;a place of&quot;, giving &quot;Luachaires&quot;, or &quot;The Place of the Rushes&quot;. The Barony of Leuchars is recorded during the reign of William the Lion (1165–1214). The 12th-century St Athernase Church is one of the finest surviving examples of an unaisled Romanesque parish church in Scotland. The church has two levels of blind arcading in the Norman style running round the exterior, surmounted by a corbel table with heads of various designs. The interior has elaborate chancel and apse arches, and a series of powerful beast-heads on the corbels supporting the ribs of the internal vaults. The nave has been rebuilt, while the apse roof is crowned by a small bell-tower added in the 17th century. The medieval Leuchars Castle was located to the north of the town: it was demolished in the 19th century but the motte can still be seen, as well as a nearby doocot.
The surrounding area was improved by drainage in the 18th century. In the 19th century, a railway station on the line from Edinburgh to Aberdeen brought increased prosperity to the town. When the St Andrews Railway branch line was closed in the late 1960s, Leuchars became the closest place to get the train to St Andrews. Since then, Leuchars railway station has been used by many University of St Andrews students. In 1911 construction started on what would become RAF Leuchars. This Royal Air Force station would host a great variety of aircraft in its time, protecting the North of the United Kingdom from airborne threats until the final QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) aircraft of 1 Squadron departed RAF Leuchars in September 2014. The Station has since been handed over to the Army as of March 2015. The station remains an RAF diversion airfield for aircraft in distress and QRA aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth.

==Notable residents==

*Rev Patrick Scougal served as Parish Minister between 1645 and 1659, later becoming Bishop of Aberdeen. He raised his sons, Henry Scougal and James Scougal, Lord Whitehill, in Leuchars. 

==Geography==
The town is located near the north-eastern coast of Fife. The town has a population of 3,060.

The town is nearly to the north of the village of Guardbridge, which lies on the north bank of the River Eden where it widens to the &quot;Edenmouth&quot; estuary before joining the North Sea at &quot;St Andrews Bay&quot;. Leuchars is north-east of Cupar and north-west from the university town of St Andrews. The city of Dundee is to the north, across the rail and road bridges that span the Firth of Tay.

The town had an adjoining Royal Air Force base, RAF Leuchars, which was established in 1920, and was home to the Eurofighter Typhoon. In 2015, the RAF base became an Army base, as the regimental headquarters of 2 Close Support Battalion REME and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, who saw their return to Scotland after 20 years in Germany, as coming home.

===Climate===
Leuchars has an oceanic climate, like most of Western Europe. On average, Leuchars gets around of rain each year and 1,573 hours of sunshine, making it one of the driest and sunniest places in Scotland. The highest recorded temperature was in August 1990, while the lowest was , which was recorded in February 1986.

<doc id="1117491" wikidata="Q669935" url="?curid=1117491" title="Berliner (format)">
<text>Berliner is a newspaper format with pages normally measuring about . The Berliner format, or &quot;midi&quot;, is slightly taller and marginally wider than the tabloid/compact format, and is both narrower and shorter than the broadsheet format.

==Origin==
The Berliner format is an innovation in press and an alternative to the broadsheet format. The name refers to the city of Berlin, and was originally contrasted with &quot;North German&quot; and &quot;French&quot; sizes in the early 20th century.

==European newspapers==
The Berliner format is used by many European newspapers, including dailies such as &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in France, in Switzerland, and in Italy, &quot;El País&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot; in Spain, &quot;De Morgen&quot;, &quot;Le Soir&quot; and &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; in Belgium, &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; in Bosnia, &quot;Mladá fronta Dnes&quot; and &quot;Lidové noviny&quot; in the Czech Republic, and others such as &quot;Expresso&quot; in Portugal and &quot;Jurnalul Național&quot; or &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; in Romania. The French business newspaper &quot;Les Échos&quot; changed to this format in September 2003, and the largest daily papers in Croatia (&quot;Večernji list&quot;), Serbia (&quot;Politika&quot;) and Montenegro (&quot;Vijesti&quot;), are also in this format. A recent European newspaper to join this trend is &quot;Het Financieele Dagblad&quot;, the daily Dutch newspaper that is focused on business and financial matters on 26 March 2013. Student publication &quot;The University Observer&quot; became Ireland&#x27;s first Berliner-sized paper in September 2009. In the UK, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; changed from broadsheet to Berliner in 2005 but changed again to tabloid in 2017 for cost-saving reasons. &quot;The Independent&quot; in London considered adopting this format, but could not afford to buy new presses; it moved directly from broadsheet to tabloid size. As of 2022, no UK national newspaper uses Berliner.

Although the daily &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; is occasionally called simply &quot;Berliner&quot;, it is &quot;not&quot; printed in Berliner format. In fact, only two German national dailies use Berliner format: &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; (generally known as the &quot;&quot;); and the &quot;Junge Welt&quot;, which in 2004 abandoned the unique slightly-larger-than-A4 size that had distinguished it since the early 1990s. The majority of the national quality dailies use the larger broadsheet format known as &quot;nordisch&quot;, measuring .

==United States newspapers==
The daily &quot;Journal &amp; Courier&quot; in Lafayette, Indiana was the first newspaper in North America to be produced in this format, making its debut on 31 July 2006. The &quot;Bucks County Herald&quot; in Lahaska, Pennsylvania, followed in 2009, and &quot;The Chronicle&quot; in Laurel, Mississippi, in April 2012, commencing publication at that time. Major papers such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; have tested the format.

Since then, a number of broadsheet newspapers throughout the United States have adopted a page format similar to Berliner, though some may use a taller page. In some instances, only the width has changed from the typical broadsheet page, and the height has remained the same or close to it. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; used a tall by wide page, but in 2007 downsized to . It still refers to itself as a broadsheet, even though its size is closer to Berliner.

==Asian newspapers==
The Indian business daily &quot;Mint&quot;, a collaboration with the Indian media house &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; Media Limited (HTML) and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, was among the first newspapers to use the Berliner format, starting from 1 February 2007. In Nepal, the &quot;Nepali Times&quot; became the first and the only newspaper using this format. In Pakistan, the English daily &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; is published in the Berliner format. The Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; has been published in this format since 18 February 2007.

Though very rarely used in Metro Manila, the Berliner is the most popular format in the Philippines. In the Ilocandia, some of the well-known names are the &quot;Zigzag Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Northern Dispatch&quot;—commonly called as &quot;Nordis&quot;—and the &quot;Northern Philippine Times&quot;. In the Visayas, the &quot;Panay News&quot; (Visayas&#x27; most widely circulated newspaper) also uses this format. Though not published for commercial purposes, the official publication of Caritas Manila uses a slightly narrower Berliner format.

In March 2009, South Korea&#x27;s &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot; adopted the Berliner format, becoming the first Korean newspaper to do so. Also in the same month, Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Gazete Habertürk&quot; and &quot;Zaman&quot; adopted a variation of this format as and become two of the first Turkish newspaper to do so. The format is called Ciner format in Turkey because it is unique. On 1 June 2012, the UAE&#x27;s leading English language newspaper, &quot;Gulf News&quot;, adopted the Berliner format, the first ever in the Arab Middle East.

==South American newspapers==
Some South American papers have dubbed the &quot;compact&quot; size as &quot;Berliner&quot;. The former (also called &quot;tall tab&quot;) size is closer to tabloid, being marginally taller. The &quot;Buenos Aires Herald&quot;, a daily Argentine newspaper founded in 1876, uses the Berliner format, which is also used by &quot;La Nueva&quot;, a newspaper of the Buenos Aires province. Córdoba newspaper &quot;La Voz&quot; switched to Berliner from broadsheet in 2016. The Bolivian &quot;Los Tiempos&quot; newspaper from Cochabamba releases its editions in Berliner with full color in all pages starting October 2017. Previously, the newspaper was published in broadsheet. Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;, a daily Brazilian newspaper founded in 1891, was published in Berliner from 16 April 2006 until 31 August 2010, when the newspaper ceased to publish its physical issue and transferred all activities to the internet. Initially, only the newsstand edition was in that format, but its success made the format switch extend later to the subscriber&#x27;s edition, which until then had remained in broadsheet format. In 2008, Salvador-based &quot;Correio*&quot; (formerly &quot;Correio da Bahia&quot;) switched to Berliner, also from broadsheet. After being sold by Organizações Globo (currently Grupo Globo) to J. Hawilla&#x27;s Grupo Traffic, another Brazilian newspaper, &quot;Diário de S. Paulo&quot;, which was a broadsheet, switched to Berliner, bringing it in line with its sister publications under Rede Bom Dia (the company, including &quot;Diário de S. Paulo&quot;, is currently owned by Cereja Digital). In 2003, Chilean national newspaper switched from tabloid to Berliner. Local papers around Chile have also adopted the format, most notably &quot;El Mercurio de Valparaíso&quot;, the longest-running newspaper in Spanish language. As of 17 November 2017, the format expanded to Chilean &quot;La Cuarta&quot;, which previously published in tabloid, like . The Peruvian &quot;El Comercio&quot;, the nation&#x27;s most important newspaper, switched its weekday editions to Berliner in 2016. The weekend editions are still produced in broadsheet. Brazilian newspaper O Estado de São Paulo switched its physical edition to Berliner format as of 17 October 2021.
==African newspapers==

In February 2010, Mauritius&#x27;s century-old &quot;Le Mauricien&quot; adopted the Berliner format with full-colour content, thus becoming the first evening national paper in the country to adopt this format.

==Career==
=== Breakthrough (1986–1990) ===

Chawla&#x27;s debut role in Bollywood was a small part in the 1986 film &quot;Sultanat&quot;. In 1987, she starred in Kannada-Tamil bilingual film &quot;Premaloka&quot; (&quot;Paruva Ragam&quot; in Tamil) directed and produced by V Ravichandran. The Kannada version turned out to be a major commercial success and proved to be a break-through film for the lead cast and technical crew.

She got her first major Hindi cinema role in &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; in 1988, in which she starred with Aamir Khan. The film, a modern-day adaption of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, was both a major critical and commercial success, with Khan and Chawla becoming &quot;overnight stars&quot;. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film, and Chawla became the first actress to win the Filmfare Award for Lux New Face of the Year, also receiving her first nomination for Best Actress. Chawla&#x27;s pairing with Aamir Khan and their on-screen chemistry was often cited by the media as successful. The film has since attained a cult status, with &quot;The Times of India&quot; ranking it among the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the landmark films of Hindi cinema&quot; and crediting it with making &quot;Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla household names&quot;. Premankur Biswas of &quot;First Post&quot; wrote in a retrospective review, &quot;Juhi Chawla, with her flouncy ghagra and passive but assertive demeanor was an early predecessor to the sexually liberated Bollywood heroines of today. She wore what she wanted and initiated a relationship with the man she desired&quot;. The team &quot;Premaloka&quot; reunited in 1989 for the Kannada film &quot;Kindari Jogi&quot; and was declared a musical hit. In the same year she debuted in Telugu cinema with the film &quot;Vicky Daada&quot; co-starring Nagarjuna.

=== Established actress (1990–1997)===
In 1990, she starred in &quot;Pratibandh&quot;. She also received her second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for the film. Her other releases that year included the family drama &quot;Swarg&quot; alongside Rajesh Khanna and Govinda, which marked the first of several collaborations with director David Dhawan. In 1991, she collaborated third time with actor-director V Ravichandran for his multilingual directorial &quot;Shanti Kranti&quot; (&quot;Nattukku Oru Nallavan&quot; in Tamil). The film, made with an expensive budget, underperformed at the box office leading into huge losses to the makers. The Tamil version saw her pairing opposite Rajinikanth. In 1992, she appeared in &quot;Bol Radha Bol&quot; alongside Rishi Kapoor, for which she received her third Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. Another pairing with Aamir Khan in &quot;Daulat Ki Jung&quot; resulted in negative reviews.

In 1993, Chawla appeared in four films. Her first release was the action film &quot;Lootere&quot;, directed by Dharmesh Darshan and starring Sunny Deol, Naseeruddin Shah, Chunkey Pandey and Anupam Kher. She played a young woman who receives witness protection through the service of a bodyguard, played by Deol, with whom she eventually falls in love. She was cast in two movies produced by Yash Chopra. The first was the romantic drama &quot;Aaina&quot;, which saw Chawla and Amrita Singh play sisters falling for the same man, played by Jackie Shroff. Her third film that year was Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke&quot; opposite Aamir Khan, which was a success with both critics and audiences. Her performance as a Tamilian runaway, which required her to master Tamil language and dialect, met with acclaim and established her as a comic actress. Writing for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, Udaya Tara Nayar noted that she played her role &quot;to perfection&quot;. She won a Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her work. The last film she appeared in that year was the musical psychological thriller &quot;Darr&quot;, directed by Yash Chopra. The film was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, making it Chawla&#x27;s fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. &quot;Darr&quot; was also a major critical success, winning several awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. She played Kiran, a young woman about to get married with her fiancé (Deol) when she becomes the object of a young man&#x27;s (Khan) obsession.

Subsequently, she played leading roles in several films, most notably as Saraswati in David Dhawan&#x27;s &quot;Andaz&quot; (1994), Laxmi in Surendra Kumar Bohra&#x27;s &quot;Saajan Ka Ghar&quot; (1994), Bela in Rajiv Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Ram Jaane&quot; (1995), Sandhya in &quot;Naajayaz&quot; (1995), which marked one of her rare collaborations with Ajay Devgn, and Kiran in David Dhawan and Boney Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Loafer&quot; (1996), and all of them emerged as critical and commercial successes. She received critical acclaim for her performance as a battered wife in Abbas Mustan&#x27;s thriller &quot;Daraar&quot; (1996), and she received a nomination of Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. The film was not a major commercial success, but Chawla&#x27;s performance earned her positive reviews. She was also offered Karisma Kapoor&#x27;s role in &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), but she turned it down. Chawla&#x27;s career had hit its peak, and she regained mainstream success in 1997 with the romantic comedies &quot;Yes Boss&quot;, &quot;Deewana Mastana&quot; and &quot;Ishq&quot;, all becoming box office hits. &quot;Ishq&quot; became one of the top-earners of the year, and earned critical praise for the performances of its four leads.

In the romantic comedy &quot;Yes Boss&quot;, she played a model who becomes the love interest of an ad agency owner and his ambitious employee, played by Aditya Pancholi and Shah Rukh Khan, respectively. &quot;Yes Boss&quot; opened to favourable reviews and did well commercially, and Chawla received a seventh Filmfare nomination for her portrayal, which was described by &quot;Screen&quot; as &quot;spirited&quot;. In a 1998 retrospective review for &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Khushboo Tiwari called it &quot;a quintessential ‘90s romcom&quot; and took note of Chawla&#x27;s chemistry with Khan. In the comedy &quot;Deewana Mastana&quot;, Chawla played Dr. Neha Sharma, love interest to both Kapoor and Govinda and ends up marrying Salman Khan. The film was a commercial success. Her other release of the year was &quot;Mr and Mrs Khiladi&quot; alongside Akshay Kumar. The film turned out to be an average grosser at the box-office.

=== Setback (1998–2000) ===

In 1998, she appeared once again alongside Shah Rukh Khan in &quot;Duplicate&quot;, the film was produced by Yash Johar and directed by Mahesh Bhatt. Despite ranking as the 12th highest grosser of the year, the film underperformed at the box office upon its release. The same year, she appeared in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s swan song &quot;Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate&quot; alongside Anil Kapoor; the film was received well by critics for its reminiscence of Mukherjee&#x27;s films, with one critic calling it a &quot;a classy comedy&quot;. The same year, she also appeared in Priyadarshan&#x27;s rural drama &quot;Saat Rang Ke Sapne&quot; opposite Arvind Swamy. The film underperformed at the box-office, but Khalid Mohamed wrote of her that she is &quot;only saving grace. Lovely to look at and an instinctive actress, she&#x27;s a likeable as ever.&quot; The same year, she starred in the Malayalam detective comedy &quot;Harikrishnans&quot; opposite Mohanlal and Mammootty. &quot;Harikrishnans&quot; was a commercial success.

In 1999, she appeared in &quot;Arjun Pandit&quot; alongside Sunny Deol. She played a woman who seeks revenge in the film and described her character as &quot;a role with negative shades&quot;. The critical reception to the film was lukewarm, but Chawla&#x27;s work was better received. The film was the thirteenth highest-grossing film of 1999, and emerged as a moderate critical and commercial success. The same year, she also starred opposite Sanjay Dutt in the adventure film &quot;Safari&quot;, a critical and commercial failure. She worked free of charge in the Punjabi-language biographical film &quot;Shaheed Udham Singh&quot;, based on the life of Udham Singh.

=== Professional expansion (2000–2010) ===

In 2000, alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Aziz Mirza, she opened a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The romantic comedy &quot;Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani&quot; was the company&#x27;s first production starring Chawla and Khan. Upon release, the film underperformed at the box office, though over the years it has been appreciated for its bold theme on media wars. Chawla&#x27;s performance as the journalist Ria Banarjee received appreciation from the critics. Rediff critic Swapna Mitter wrote, &quot;This is probably one of Juhi&#x27;s best performances. She has never looked better... and once again, like &quot;Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke&quot;, she shows a flair for comedy.&quot; Her other release of the year was Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s delayed &quot;&quot;, which was in the making for over five years and failed upon release. She played a small role in &quot;Gang&quot;.

In 2001, she appeared in the action comedy &quot;One 2 Ka 4&quot; with Shah Rukh Khan, in their seventh collaboration and with Jackie Shroff, the film was a flop at the box office. Chawla played three roles in the film; a haryanvi maid, a bar dancer and an undercover cop. While the film was noticed for its serious content, her comedic performance won acclaim from several critics. Vinayak Chakravorty wrote, &quot;But the winner here is Juhi — that vintage comic flair of &quot;Hum Hain Raahi Pyaar Ke&quot; almost comes back from the dead.&quot; Similarly, Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; &quot;The only saving grace in this sea of confusion is Juhi. As a fast talking Haryanvi loudmouth who has the hots for her &#x27;Ricky Martin&#x27; (Shahrukh), she is an absolute delight.&quot; &quot;The Hindu&quot; agreed with this observation, further noting her &quot;unfailing sense of humour&quot; and timing, which &quot;few can match&quot;. Another release of the year was the comedy &quot;Aamdani Atthani Kharcha Rupaiyaa&quot; opposite Govinda. Around the same time, she signed a Kannada film &quot;Adhishesha&quot;, in which she was to star opposite her &quot;Premaloka&quot; co–star V. Ravichandran. 
Having taken a one-year break from film work, Chawla started appearing in independent and art films, and her work included critically acclaimed films &quot;Jhankaar Beats&quot;, &quot;3 Deewarein&quot; (both 2003), &quot;7½ Phere&quot; and &quot;My Brother Nikhil&quot; (both 2005), and &quot;Bas Ek Pal&quot; (2006). &quot;Jhankaar Beats&quot;, a musical comedy and a tribute to music director R. D. Burman, saw her play the wife of an aspiring musician. She won a Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;3 Deewarein&quot;, which earned her positive reviews. Director Kukunoor wrote the film with Chawla in mind, aspiring to change her image. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Chawla gradually settles into a role that contains at least three different character layers to it.&quot; Chawla said &quot;3 Deewarein&quot; was a mould-breaking film in her career, and spoke of the revealing experience in making non-mainstream films which require a more realistic approach to acting and minimal use of make-up. She acted opposite Gurdas Mann in the Punjabi-language feature &quot;Des Hoyaa Pardes&quot; (2004) which was warmly received. She said she chose the part because upon reading the script, she identified a &quot;tremendous scope for performance&quot;. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi.

Set in Goa between 1986 and 1994, Onir&#x27;s &quot;My Brother Nikhil&quot; centers on the character of Nikhil (played by Sanjay Suri), a young man who is tested HIV-positive. Chawla co-starred as Anamika Kapoor, a schoolteacher by profession and Nikhil&#x27;s loving and supportive elder sister, who accepts his same-gender partner and stands by his side through his struggle. The film opened to a welcome reception by critics, and Chawla&#x27;s performance was particularly praised. Khalid Mohamed was highly approving of her portrayal: &quot;Above all, Juhi Chawla is perfect. Her effortless blend of conflicting emotions is what A-class acting is all about. Ms Chawla is a diamond in this little gem of a movie.&quot; She starred alongside Irfan Khan in &quot;7½ Phere&quot;. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; commended her comic performance.

In 2006, she appeared in the ensemble drama &quot;Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute To Love&quot; directed by Nikhil Advani. She collaborated with Onir once again with in the drama &quot;Bas Ek Pal&quot; (2006) alongside Urmila Matondkar and Sanjay Suri. She played Ira Malhotra, a battered wife who refuses to leave her possessive husband for religious reasons. The film opened to positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha wrote of Chawla that she &quot;uses her ability to portray hurt and guilt with minimum effort.&quot; The same year she starred in another Punjabi film, the historical drama &quot;Waris Shah: Ishq Daa Waaris&quot;, which won a National Film Award. According to the BBC, the film &quot;bears the hallmarks of a quality production&quot;. The film is based on the life of Punjabi poet Waris Shah during the times he wrote the poem &quot;Heer&quot;.

Chawla and Manoj Bajpayee played a married couple in Ganesh Acharya&#x27;s drama &quot;Swami&quot; (2007), which follows their financial struggles to secure proper education for their intelligent son. Reviews of the film were varied. Tanveer Bookwala of Rediff appreciated the film for its simple story and for giving the lead pair &quot;the chance to be unconventional and subtle and they do not fail to deliver.&quot;

Chawla then appeared in Ravi Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Bhoothnath&quot; (2008) with Amitabh Bachchan, in which she made her singing debut with the song &quot;Chalo Jaane Do&quot;, the film was a moderate success and Chawla was appreciated for her role. Manish Gajjar from BBC wrote, &quot;Juhi Chawla&#x27;s brilliant comic timing as Banku&#x27;s mum has you in stitches.&quot; Another film called &quot;Krazzy 4&quot; with Irfan Khan and Arshad Warsi was released in 2008, the film failed to do well at the box office. In 2009, she appeared in a cameo appearance in &quot;Luck By Chance&quot; to play a comic part for which she dyed her hair blonde. The film and Chawla&#x27;s performance got highly positive reviews and got a good opening at the box office.

=== Intermittent acting roles (2010–present) ===

In 2011, Chawla starred in Onir&#x27;s critically acclaimed anthology film &quot;I Am&quot; (2010). Unfolded in several chapters, the film starred Chawla alongside Manisha Koirala in an episode named &quot;I Am Megha&quot;. She played the title role of a Kashmiri Pandit who travels back to her hometown in Srinagar, having been driven out of it years ago. For her performance, Chawla was awarded the Best Actress award at the 13th London Asian Film Festival and Award for Excellence in Hindi Cinema at the Asiavision Movie Awards. Her performance also earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Rajeev Masand wrote, &quot;Juhi Chawla is a portrait of suppressed vulnerability as she confronts her feelings about an old home and an old friend.&quot;

Chawla next starred in the action comedy &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot; (2012) opposite Sanjay Dutt, which was poorly received by critics. &quot;Live Mint&quot; called it &quot;the worst portrayal of Punjabiyat in Hindi cinema&quot;, although it referred to her part as &quot;the only unique role in the film&quot; and further noted, &quot;An actor with proven talent for comedy, Chawla makes Pammi, her character, pathetic as well as feisty.&quot; The film earned worldwide.

After a period of limited work in films, Chawla made a comeback in 2014 with &quot;Gulaab Gang&quot; opposite her once-archrival Madhuri Dixit. The film, in which Chawla and Dixit played ruthless political rivals, marked Chawla&#x27;s role as an antagonist. Her portrayal of Sumitra Devi, a shrewd and conniving politician, was widely appreciated by critics. Shubhra Gupta of &quot;The Financial Times&quot; described her character as &quot;the sort of politician that men have played for ever: hungry for power, will stop at nothing, not even murder and mayhem. She rules with an iron fist and a sneer.&quot; &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote, &quot;An effective hero needs a larger-than-life villain. In this case, it is Juhi Chawla who marries her sister to a rapist and apparently killed her husband to get political power. Like most corrupt politicians we see onscreen, she is an opportunist who lusts for power. It speaks well about her acting prowess that we come to hate the otherwise effervescent Juhi in this film.&quot; Anupama Chopra wrote, &quot;Her perverse wickedness is the best part of the film&quot;, but called it a &quot;a one-note character&quot;. Rajeev Masand called her &quot;terrific&quot; in the part and concluded a scathing review of the film asserting, &quot;if you must watch this film, watch it for Juhi Chawla&#x27;s inspired performance.&quot; She received a second Filmfare nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The same year she also appeared with Helen Mirren and Om Puri in a guest role in the Steven Spielberg-produced Hollywood film &quot;The Hundred Foot Journey&quot;.

In 2016, she starred in the woman-centric drama &quot;Chalk n Duster&quot; with Shabana Azmi. The film received mixed reviews from critics and Chawla&#x27;s performance was well received. In a critical review for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Namrata Joshi noted &quot;Azmi and Chawla who, with their dignified presence and easy camaraderie stop you from heading to the exit door.&quot; Rohit Vats of &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; liked the film for its &quot;well told ethics versus greed story&quot; and mentioned Chawla&#x27;s heartwarming presence. In 2017, she played an Indian defence minister in the Alt Balaji web series &quot;The Test Case&quot;.

Chawla starred in the web series &quot;Hush Hush&quot;&quot;,&quot; which released on Amazon Prime Video in 2022.

<text>Aix-en-Diois (; Vivaro-Alpine: &quot;Ais de Diés&quot;) is a former commune in the Drôme department in southeastern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune Solaure-en-Diois.

==History==
Aix-en-Diois belonged to the counts and later to the bishops of Die (twelfth century). Later, it belonged to the Princes of Orange, and finally to the La Tour du Pin family (seventeenth century). The commune contains the remains of Roman baths and the ruins of a 13th-century medieval castle with a polygonal enclosure and corner towers, rebuilt in the 16th century.

<doc id="1117497" wikidata="Q5486973" url="?curid=1117497" title="Frank Grover">
<text>Frank Grover (born 19 March 1940) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1996 to 1999, representing first the Alliance and then the Christian Heritage Party in the House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Grover was born in Auckland on 19 March 1940, the son of Madge Grover (née Troutbeck) and Percival Gordon Grover. Before entering politics, Grover had a background in law, having received an LLB from University of Auckland. He worked as a magistrate in Hong Kong from 1979 to 1983.

==Political career==

===The Liberals===
Grover was originally a member of the National Party, but became disillusioned with National&#x27;s economic policy under Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson. Richardson promoted strong free market economic theories, which were popular with some sections of the party, but resented by more conservative elements. Gilbert Myles and Hamish McIntyre, two National MPs who believed that Richardson&#x27;s reforms were deeply harmful to society, split from the party in 1992, founding the new Liberal Party. Grover was one of those who accompanied them.

Soon afterwards, the Liberals chose to join the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition which they saw as the most significant opponent of Richardson and her allies. Some members of the Liberals, quite possibly including Grover, were unhappy at this decision, however – while they opposed Richardson&#x27;s reforms, they did not see themselves as left-wing. Following the failure of either Myles or McIntyre to be re-elected, Myles decamped to the newly founded New Zealand First party and McIntyre retired. Grover assumed the leadership of the Liberals in 1994.

===Member of Parliament===


Grover was elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as an Alliance list MP. He disagreed with the Alliance on a number of issues, however, and on 11 June 1999, not long before the 1999 election, he officially quit the Alliance to join the Christian Heritage Party. This gave the CHP its only ever seat in Parliament. In 1998 Grover had indicated that he would stand for the Christian Democrat Party, but when they became Future New Zealand he decided to join the CHP instead. Grover&#x27;s switches was strongly criticised by other parties, particularly the Alliance but also New Zealand First, which had also experienced defections. For the election, Grover was ranked sixth on Christian Heritage&#x27;s list, but the party failed to win any seats. Grover therefore left Parliament.

<doc id="1117501" wikidata="Q2425638" url="?curid=1117501" title="Socialist Party (Sweden, 1929)">
<text>The Socialist Party (), was a political party in Sweden active from 1929 to 1948. Led by Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg, the party was founded in 1929 as a splinter group of the Communist Party of Sweden. Until 1934, the splinter group used the same name Communist Party of Sweden (), so in order to keep the two factions apart, this faction was generally known as &quot;Kilbommare&quot; (&quot;Kilbomiars&quot;) while those who stayed in the old party were known as &quot;Sillénare&quot; (&quot;Sillénians&quot;, after their leader Hugo Sillén).
In the split, the entire communist parliamentary group, the party&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Folkets Dagblad Politiken&quot;, and most of the more militant members joined the Kilbom-Flyg faction.

In 1943, under Agaton Blom, they changed their name to the Swedish Socialist Party (, SSP) and existed in this form until it dissolved in 1948.

==History==
The Kilbom-led SKP held its congress prior to the Sillén-led party. At the congress there was a debate regarding the character of the party, whether to continue the system of party cells (the structure of the pre-split SKP) or whether to become a more open mass party. In the end the statues adopted by the congress differed little from those of the pre-split SKP. Party cells remained the basic organization of the party, and in places where no cell existed a party member would be organized in the &quot;arbetarkommun&quot; directly. However the criteria for membership were relaxed, the sole remaining criterion was activism in the base level organization.

In 1930, Flyg, as an MP, put forward a motion on separation of church and state. The motion was voted down in the Lower House.

The Kilbom party merged in 1934 with a break-away group of the Social Democrats based in Gothenburg, led by Albin Ström. At the time of the merger, the party changed its name to the Socialist Party (&quot;Socialistiska partiet&quot;). The transformation into SP also marked a break with the previous line of the party towards the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Initially the party had tried to persuade the Comintern to be allowed to return to the International. Gradually, however the party became more and more antagonistic toward the Comintern and the Soviet Union.

The party gradually disintegrated, and many of the most prominent leaders such as Kilbom, left the party in 1937. During World War II, their staunch anti-Soviet line led the party to actually embrace some pro-German views (partially since the huge financial problems of the party led it to seek financial aid from Germany). As a result of this, in 1940, a group of members that included Albin Ström and Evald Höglund broke away and formed the Left Socialist Party. In the elections the same year, the party lost its parliamentary representation.

When Flyg died in 1943, he was succeeded as party leader by Agaton Blom. During the final years of the war, the party continued to lose members and support, and changed its name to the &quot;Swedish Socialist Party&quot; (&quot;Svenska socialistiska partiet&quot;), which was outspokenly supportive of Nazi ideology. The Swedish Socialist Party participated in the 1944 election and received 5,279 votes or 2 per thousand; they probably never reached a thousand members. The party was disbanded in 1948.

The local units of the party were known as &quot;Socialist Labour Communes&quot; (&quot;Socialistiska Arbetarkommuner&quot;).

In terms of international contacts, the party was initially associated with the International Communist Opposition and later with the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (also known as the &quot;London Bureau&quot;).

The youth league of the party was called the Socialist Youth League (&quot;Socialistiska ungdomsförbundet&quot;), affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations.

<doc id="1117502" wikidata="Q64846325" url="?curid=1117502" title="Sinah, Hayling Island">
<text>Sinah is the area at the southwestern end of Hayling Island. It incorporates the Ferrypoint, Sinah Beach, The Kench, Sinah Warren, and Sinah Common. It is bounded to the east by West Town. Langstone Harbour and its entrance form the north and west borders, and to the south is Hayling Bay.

==History==
Monks had settled in the Sinah Warren by the 15th century. Fishermen&#x27;s huts were present in the shelter of the Kench by the 19th century. The Norkfolk Inn, precursor to the Ferry Boat Inn, was created to serve the needs of the fishermen. Around 1900 Sandeman set out to extend a road out to the ferrypoint for the Hayling Island Steamboat enterprise. While that enterprise failed the road did assist subsequent development of the Hayland Island Ferry, golf course, health farm and the war effort for the Second World War. In recent years land use of Sinah has stabilised with various areas being designated nature reserves.

==The Ferry Point==
The Ferry Point is at the westernmost tip of Hayling Island in Hampshire, England, overlooking the fast tides of Langstone Harbour entrance. It was previously known as Sinah Point.

The current at the Ferry Point is extremely treacherous and has claimed many lives over the years.

There is a small cluster of houses and a pub, the &quot;Ferry Boat Inn&quot; (originally the Duke of Norfolk). Continuing directly past the put leads to a slipway directly into the water. A fork to the left leads past the base of the Langstone Harbour Master to the jetty for the passenger ferry to Eastney in Portsmouth.

The Hayling Island golf course backs on to the point and the Kench (a small bay) lies just eastward. A single lane leads east toward the rest of the island. There are good views north to Portsdown Hill and Butser Hill.

==Sinah Beach==

Sinah Beach extends from the Ferry Boat Inn at the western end of Hayling Island.

==Sinah Warren==
Sinah Warren is the area to north of Ferry Road where the Holiday Camp is located. Monks initially had a settlement here by the 15th century, and it is jokingly put this was the first health farm on the site. The 16th century saw the monks displaced and the rights sold to the Duke of Norfolk. It may have been sold to William Padwick, Esq. in 1825. Sold to August Arbuthnot in the 1930s he built the Sinah Warren Residence and planted various species of plants and trees from his worldwide travels and established one of the first Factory Farms, initially with Angora Rabbits then with Poultry to help alleviate the food shortage in the Second World War. The Royal Navy then took over Sinah Warren until the 1950s when it was sold and developed into the current holiday camp.
==Sinah Common==

Sinah Common is the area to the south of Ferry Road incorporating the Golf course. The area is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The area of water in front of the clubhouse is seemingly nowadays referred to as Sinah Lake although an area within Langstone Harbour that forms a lake at low tide is also known as Sinah Lake. Elements of World War 2 gun batteries and pill boxes are well preserved in this area.

==The Kench==
The Kench is a small natural inlet to the north of Ferry Road. Proposals to change this into a commercial port or marina foundered or were thwarted, and the area is now a designated nature reserve with a handful of houseboats permitted.

==Landmarks and places of interest==
===Ferry Boat Inn===
The inn was known previously by various titles: as the &quot;Norfolk Inn&quot;, &quot;Norfolk Lodge (Inn)&quot;, &quot;Hayling Ferry Tavern&quot;, and the &quot;Duke of Norfolk&quot;. The original Norfolk Inn was present before 1776, built to the east of The Kench on the north side of the ferry point. The replacement building at the ferry point, south of Ferry Road, was built from the wreck of &quot;HMS Impregnable&quot; which sunk in 1799. The current building to the north of ferry was originally where the boathouse stood. Members of the Spraggs family were licensees and owners from at least 1900 until after the mid-twentieth century and were responsible for the &quot;Ferry&quot; rebranding. The Spraggs were also responsible for operation of Hayling Ferry and there was an undoubtedly synergy between the two enterprises. The establishment is no longer a freehouse, having been sold to Stonegate Pub Company, and is variously branded &quot;Ferryboat&quot; both with and without a space.

==Transport==

The Hayling Ferry links to Portsmouth from the Ferry Point, and has been running for more than 200 years. In March 2015, the service shut down when the Hayling Island Ferry company went into administration after safety problems and repeated fines for carrying too many passengers at once. Service resumed in August 2016 after a fundraising effort which included a £5,000 donation from Richard Branson.

Bus services to the ferry ceased in 2004. Efforts to re-instate the service have taken place at various times.

 Back in 2018 Havant Borough Council realised a long-held ambition for a connecting bus, coming up with £20,000 to fund a six-month trial of a Monday to Friday peak hour bus (numbered 149 – for nostalgic reasons – operated by Portsmouth City Coaches) to perform a circuit of Hayling Island before connecting to the ferry, while on the other side First Solent extended their route 15 from its Eastney terminus in Fort Cumberland Road about half a mile on to the turning circle close to the ferry&#x27;s landing stage.

<text>Tamna () was a kingdom based on Jeju Island from ancient times until it was absorbed by the Korean Joseon dynasty in 1404, following a long period of being a tributary state or autonomous administrative region of various Korean kingdoms.

The Go (Jeju) clan is the family name of the Lord (), that ruled West Tamna over 400 years. The Moon (Nampyeong) clan is the family name of the Prince (), that ruled East Tamna for 400 years.

== Name ==
The Kingdom of Tamna is also sometimes known as Tangna (탕나), Seomna (섬나), and Tammora (탐모라). It&#x27;s attested with the older 漱牟羅 /tammura/ meaning something like &#x27;valley settlement&#x27; with the second component being possibly related to the Japonic homophone &quot;mura.&quot; 

== History ==
=== Legends of founding ===

There is no discovered historical record of the founding or early history of Tamna. One legend tells that the three divine founders of the country—Go (고), Yang (양), and Bu (부)—emerged from three holes in the ground in the 24th century BC. These holes, known as the Samseonghyeol (삼성혈), are still preserved in Jeju City.

According to legend, after Yang Eul-na (양을나/良乙那) came to Jeju Island, a box washed up on the shore of the island. Yang Eul-na searched in the box and found three women, horses, cows, and agricultural seeds such as rice, corn, grain, millet, barley, and bamboo. From these beginnings, the three men established the kingdom of Tamna. He is regarded as the legendary ancestor of Yang Tang, the founder of the Jeju Yang &quot;bon-gwan&quot;.

=== Historical and archaeological records ===

Archaeological evidence indicates that the people of Tamna were engaging in active trade with Han China and Yayoi Japan, South-east-Asian nations, with the Tamil Chola dynasty, as well as rest of Korea, by the 1st century AD. The first historical reference to the kingdom may come in the 3rd century AD, in the chronicle of the Chinese Three Kingdoms period called the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. The &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; reports a strange people living on a large island near Korea, which it calls &quot;Juho&quot; (州胡, Late Han Chinese &quot;tɕu-ga&quot;, literally &quot;island barbarians&quot;). These people, who had a distinctive language and culture, engaged in trade with the Mahan people of the mainland. However, the identity of Juho with Tamna has been disputed by authorities such as the North Korean scholar Lee Ch&#x27;i-rin (이지린), who claims that Juho was a small island in the Yellow Sea.

In 476, according to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, Tamna entered into a tributary relationship with Baekje, which controlled the southwestern Korean peninsula as Tamna gave military aide with some sort of money, and enjoyed strong ties with Japan. It was thus a natural partner for Tamna. As Baekje waned, Tamna turned to Silla instead. At some point near the end of the Three Kingdoms period, Tamna officially subjugated itself to Silla. Silla then conferred on the three princes of Tamna the titles which they would hold for the remainder of the kingdom&#x27;s history: Seongju (성주, 星主), Wangja (왕자, 王子), and Donae (도내, 都內). Some sources indicate that this took place during the reign of King Munmu of Silla in the late 7th century AD.

Tamna briefly reclaimed its independence after the fall of Silla in 935. However, it was subjugated by the Goryeo dynasty in 938, and officially annexed in 1105. However, the kingdom maintained local autonomy until 1404, when Taejong of Joseon placed it under firm central control and brought the Tamna kingdom to an end. One interesting event that took place during these later years of Tamna was the Sambyeolcho Rebellion, which came to a bloody end on Jeju Island in 1274.

Alexander Vovin (2013) notes that the old name for Jeju Island is &quot;tammura&quot;, which can be analyzed in Japanese as &quot;tani mura&quot; たにむら ( &#x27;valley settlement&#x27;) or &quot;tami mura&quot; たみむら ( &#x27;people&#x27;s settlement&#x27;). Thus, Vovin concludes that Japonic speakers were present on Jeju Island before being replaced by Koreanic speakers sometime before the 15th century.

== Rulers ==
=== Kings of Tamna ===
The Go clan is the family name of the kings that ruled Tamna, and the first king was one of the three who emerged from the ground. His descendants became the future kings of Tamna.

=== Lords and governors of West Tamna ===
The Go(Jeju) clan is the family name of the Lord(Seongju, 성주, 星主), that ruled West Tamna.
*Based on Tamnaji(탐라지, 耽羅志), Goryeosa(고려사, 高麗史) and The Veritable Records of Joseon Dynasty (조선왕조실록, 朝鮮王朝實錄)

=== Princes and governors of East Tamna ===
The Moon(Nampyeong) clan is the family name of the Prince(Wangja, 왕자, 王子), that ruled East Tamna.
*Based on Tamnaji(탐라지, 耽羅志), Goryeosa(고려사, 高麗史) and The Veritable Records of Joseon Dynasty (조선왕조실록, 朝鮮王朝實錄)

==Language==

The Tamna language might have been Japonic in origin, later being replaced by a Koreanic language. Alexander Vovin compares certain glosses of Jeju Japonic to words of other Japonic languages.

<doc id="1117524" wikidata="Q2661381" url="?curid=1117524" title="Malahide Castle">
<text>Malahide Castle (), parts of which date to the 12th century, lies close to the village of Malahide, 14 km (nine miles) north of central Dublin in Ireland. It has over of remaining parkland estate, forming the Malahide Demesne Regional Park.

==History==
The estate began in 1185, when Richard Talbot, a knight who accompanied Henry II to Ireland in 1174, was granted the &quot;lands and harbour of Malahide.&quot; The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 12th century and it was home to the Talbot family for 791 years, from 1185 until 1976, the only exception being the period from 1649 to 1660, when Oliver Cromwell granted it to Miles Corbet after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland; Corbet was hanged following the demise of Cromwell, and the castle was restored to the Talbots. The building was notably enlarged in the reign of Edward IV, with towers added in 1765.

The estate survived such losses as the Battle of the Boyne, when fourteen members of the owner&#x27;s family sat down to breakfast in the Great Hall, and all were dead by evening, and the penal laws, even though the family remained Roman Catholic until 1774.

In 1918, during the First World War, a mooring-out base for airships was established in the grounds of the castle, used by airships from RNAS Anglesey in Wales which conducted anti-submarine operations in the Irish Sea. There were plans to base airships in the castle grounds from 1919, but they were abandoned at the end of the war.

In the 1920s, the private papers of James Boswell were discovered in the castle and sold to American collector Ralph H. Isham by Boswell&#x27;s great-great-grandson Lord Talbot de Malahide. The papers have since passed to Yale University, which has published popular and scholarly editions of his journals and correspondence. Soon after, a second cache was discovered and also purchased by Isham.

Malahide Castle and its demesne was eventually inherited by the 7th Baron Talbot who had wanted to donate it to the state. On his death in 1973, the castle passed to his sister, Rose, who had lived there as a caretaker in the 1950s. She had death duties to pay, and the government would not accept valuables, so they had to be sold. In 1975, Rose ceded the castle to the Irish State, with regret, to fund the outstanding inheritance taxes. Many of the contents, notably furnishings, which had been sold, had caused some controversy. Private and government parties were able to retrieve some from the purchasers.

==Visiting==
The castle, along with its subsidiary attractions, was for many years operated as a tourist attraction by Dublin Tourism, working with Fingal County Council, which owns the whole demesne. The operating partner is now Shannon Heritage, which has in turn appointed subsidiary partners, most notably, for shop and café facilities, Avoca Handweavers.

The castle itself can be visited for a fee, on a guided-tour-only basis. In addition, it is possible to hire the famously Gothic Great Hall for private banquets. The castle&#x27;s best-known rooms are the Oak Room, and the Great Hall, which displays Talbot family history. In the courtyard behind the castle are a café and craft shop, and other retail facilities.

The Talbot Botanic Gardens, situated behind the castle, comprises several hectares of plants and lawns, a walled garden of 1.6 hectares and seven glasshouses, including a Victorian conservatory. Many plants from the southern hemisphere, notably Chile and Australia, are featured. The gardens showcase the plant-collecting passion of the 7th Lord Talbot of Malahide in the mid-20th Century.

The demesne is one of few surviving examples of 18th-century landscaped parks and has wide lawns surrounded by a protective belt of trees. It can be visited freely, with a number of entrances and car parking areas.

In addition to woodland walks, and a marked &quot;exercise trail,&quot; the park features sports grounds, including a cricket pitch and several football pitches, a 9-hole par-3 golf course, an 18-hole pitch-and-putt course, tennis courts and a boules area.

Adjacent to the golfing facilities, and containing access to them, is a pavilion which also contains a café and other facilities.

There is an extensive children&#x27;s playground near the castle.

A seasonal road train operates in a loop from the vicinity of the castle to the railway station and back. A Malahide Castle and coastal tour bus begins its journeys in Malahide Castle and continues to Howth, with two daily departures.

===Former exhibits===
Two major exhibits were required to move away from the demesne in 2010–2011, as the park was prepared for a relaunch under new management. One reopened in 2011, and the other, after many delays, in 2020:
*Tara&#x27;s Palace Museum of Childhood was formerly located at Malahide Castle, but relocated to Powerscourt Estate near Enniskerry in 2011.
*The Fry Model Railway was located at Malahide Castle from 1988 to 2010. After many delays, it re-opened in 2020 at the restored Casino House, a former shooting lodge of the Talbot de Malahide family, located near the railway station.

==Cricket==

The cricket venue is located in the Lady Acre field and is home to Malahide Cricket Club. It also attracts international fixtures with teams such as Australia, England and Pakistan. In September 2013 using temporary grandstands and hospitality pavilions over 10,000 spectators were accommodated, a record for the Island of Ireland.

==Access==
The main entrance to the demesne is off the Malahide Road, with access also possible from Malahide village. Dublin Bus route numbers 42, 102 and 142 lie along one side of the park, and Malahide Railway Station is near the castle end of the park.

== Concert venue ==
The grounds at Malahide Castle were opened as a new concert venue by Fingal County Council in summer 2007, with concerts by Arctic Monkeys, Pink, Joe Cocker, Al Green and Bell X1 amongst others. In 2008 performers included Neil Young, Radiohead, and Eric Clapton. Prince performed at the Castle on 30 July 2011.

In the summer of 2017 two more bands played at the venue, with a capacity of 20,000 people. The band Arcade Fire brought their &#x27;Everything Now&#x27; tour to the venue. The next day, The 1975 performed.

More artists played the grounds in June 2018, including Chic featuring Nile Rodgers, Liam Gallagher, Gorillaz, Kodaline, and LCD soundsystem.

June 2019 saw more artists perform in the venue, over a longer period of time compared to previous years. Snow Patrol were followed by The Cure the following day, and Mumford &amp; Sons performed on both the Friday and Saturday of the second weekend, with Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds playing on Sunday. George Ezra performed on the Friday of the third and final weekend, with Lana Del Rey playing on the Saturday. In June 2023, a Depeche Mode concert took place.

=== Concert history ===
== World Scout Moot ==
The grounds of the castle were to have been the base camp of the 16th World Scout Moot, to be hosted by Scouting Ireland in July and August 2021.
The event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>John Rainolds (or Reynolds) (1549 – 21 May 1607) was an English academic and churchman, of Puritan views. He is remembered for his role in the Authorized Version of the Bible, a project of which he was initiator.

==Life==
He was born about Michaelmas 1549 at Pinhoe, near Exeter. He was fifth son of Richard Rainolds; William Rainolds was his brother. His uncle Thomas Rainolds held the living of Pinhoe from 1530 to 1537, and was subsequently Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Dean of Exeter. John Rainolds appears to have entered the University of Oxford originally at Merton, but on 29 April 1563 he was elected to a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, where two of his brothers, Hierome and Edmond, were already fellows. He became probationary fellow on 11 October 1566, and full fellow two years later. While a student at Corpus, he converted from Catholicism to Protestantism.

On 15 October 1568 he graduated B.A.; and about this time he was assigned as tutor to Richard Hooker. In 1566 he played the female role of Hippolyta in a performance of the play &quot;Palamon and Arcite&quot; at Oxford, as part of an elaborate entertainment for Queen Elizabeth I. She rewarded him with 8 gold angels. Rainolds later recalled this youthful role with embarrassment, as he came to support Puritan objections to the theatre, being particularly critical of cross-dressing roles.

In 1572–73 Rainolds was appointed reader in Greek, and his lectures on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot; made his reputation. In 1576 he objected to the proposal that Antonio de Corro should be allowed to proceed Doctor of Divinity; and at the same time he was instrumental in having Francesco Pucci expelled from the university, Pucci being an associate and ally of Corro, who had moved against orthodox Calvinist positions. Rainolds resigned his readership in 1578. The popular, young scholar was promoted as a candidate for college president by many university authorities in 1579, when it was thought to be an opening for the position.

In the early 1580s, in the aftermath of Edmund Campion&#x27;s strenuous defence of Catholic principles, Francis Walsingham sent the Jesuit John Hart to Rainolds for an extended discussion. Hart conceded to Rainolds on the deposing power of the Pope, at least according to the Protestant perspective, and an account was published in &quot;The summe of the conference betweene John Rainoldes and John Hart&quot; (1584). Unable to agree with the president of Corpus, William Cole, Rainolds then gave up his fellowship in 1586, and became a tutor at Queen&#x27;s College. In the same year Rainolds was appointed to a temporary lectureship, founded by Walsingham, for anti-Catholic polemical theology.

In 1589 the Regius Chair of Divinity at Oxford fell vacant. Rainolds had reason to anticipate the position would be his, but the Queen objected, and Thomas Holland was appointed. Rainolds&#x27;s lectureship was continued by Walsingham.

By this time he had acquired a considerable reputation as a disputant on the Puritan side, and the story goes that Elizabeth I visiting the university in 1592 &quot;schooled him for his obstinate preciseness, willing him to follow her laws, and not run before them.&quot;

In 1593 Rainolds was made dean of Lincoln College, Oxford and/or of Lincoln Cathedral. The fellows of Corpus were anxious to replace Cole with Rainolds, and an exchange was effected, Rainolds being elected president in December 1598.

==Creation of the King James Version of the Bible==
The chief events of his subsequent career were his share in the Hampton Court Conference, where he was the most prominent representative of the Puritan party and received a good deal of favour from the King.

During the Conference, the Puritans, led by Rainolds as spokesperson, directly questioned James about their grievances. However, almost every request brought forward by Rainolds was immediately denied or disputed by James. At some point during the course of Rainolds&#x27; pleading before the king, Rainolds made a request that &quot;one only translation of the Bible . . . [be] declared authentical, and read in the church&quot;. Whether Rainolds was asking for a new translation or simply for a direction to authorize only one of the existing English translations, most took Rainolds&#x27; words as a request for the former. James readily agreed to a new translation.

During the creation of the subsequent drafting of the new translation of the Bible, Rainolds worked as a part of the group which undertook the translation of the Prophets. The group met weekly in Rainolds&#x27; lodgings in Corpus. Despite being afflicted by failing eyesight and gout, Rainolds continued the work of translation to the end of his life, even being carried into the meeting room.

==Death==
Rainolds died of consumption on 21 May 1607, leaving a great reputation for scholarship and high character. On his deathbed he earnestly desired absolution according to the form of the Church of England, and received it from Dr. Thomas Holland (translator), whose hand he affectionately kissed. He is buried in the chapel of Corpus Christi.

Go, see my sweet companion 
The sweet pleasures of the Champaigne 
Its fields, its waves and woods. 
Go and see this beautiful edifice 
That nature and artifice 
Have embellished with a hundred pleasures. 
This is &quot;Aiz&quot; that beautiful abode 
Only to be torn away in less than an hour 
Our most ambitious desires. 
There, a pleasant sorrow
The certainty fleeing across the plain 
Where the hares follow us; 
There saintly solitude 
Far from trials and business affairs, 
Happily we live.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Marshal of Poland () is the highest rank in the Polish Army. It has been granted to only six officers. At present, Marshal is equivalent to a field marshal or general of the army (OF-10) in other NATO armies.

==History==

Today there are no living Marshals of Poland, since this rank is bestowed only on military commanders who have achieved victory in war. Recently, however, the rank of four-star with the modernised name &quot;Generał&quot; has been introduced, and on August 15, 2002, was granted to Czesław Piątas, at present civilian, former Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces.

==List of Marshals==
In all, the following people have served as Marshals of Poland.

<text>Tierney is an Irish surname, and a female given name.

The name is an Anglicized form of the Irish language surname (literally &quot;Descendant of Tiarnach&quot;; historically spelt ), derived from , the Irish word for &#x27;lord&#x27; or &#x27;master&#x27;. It is sometimes a variant of Tiernan ().
==Families==
Five unrelated families of the name arose in Gaelic Ireland, in what is now County Clare, County Mayo, County Monaghan, County Meath, and County Tipperary.

===Ó Tighearnaigh of Cenél nEógain===
This family lived in the territory of Fearnmuigh or Fearnmaigh [which means &#x27;the territory of the plain&#x27;], in an area in South Monaghan/South Armagh that is the present Barony of Farney, whose principal town is Carrickmacross.

===Ó Tighearnaigh of Uí Fiachrach Muaidhe===
This family were Lords of Carra. Almost the only family member recorded in the annals was Flann Ó Tighearnaigh. Gilbert Ó Tigernaig, Bishop of Annaghdown (1306–1323), was also a member of this family.

===Ó Tighearnaigh of Brega===
This family claimed descent from Tigernach mac Fócartai (died 865), one of the Kings of Brega. They were a branch of the southern Uí Néill. &quot;The Kingdom is said to have stretched from Birr in County Offaly to the Hill of Uishneach in Westmeath. Tighearnach resided at the Great Crannóg of Lagore, which is situated near Ratoath in County Meath, not far from Dublin. Tighearnach led the Irish to a great victory over the Norse Vikings in 848 A.D.&quot;

===Ó Tighearnaigh of Ormond===
A family of the name resided in Ormond, now County Tipperary. Their origins are obscure. New research now confirms that this family was indeed an indigenous sept. Their seat was in the townland of Park and their lands, Fearann Ó Tighearnaigh, took in most of the present-day townlands of Ballymackey, Ballyknockane, Carrowea, Clash, Falleen, Gortnadrumman, Kilgorteen and Knockane.

===Ó Tighearnaigh of Corcu Modruad===
This is an area in northern County Clare. This sept were hereditary priests and monks.

<doc id="1117558" wikidata="Q8060045" url="?curid=1117558" title="Yuan Wencai">
<text>Yuan Wencai (), also Yuan Xuansan () was a former bandit chieftain who operated in the Jinggang Mountains of Jiangxi, from 1923, and then joined the Chinese Communist Party, becoming a protégé of Mao Zedong during their formative period in the Jiangxi Soviet. However, it cost his own life in the following power struggle within the Chinese Communist Party.

==Early life==
Yuan was born into a Hakka family in Maoping Township, Jinggangshan City, Jiangxi, at the foothills of the Luoxian Mountains, in October, 1898. After graduating from a private elementary school, he dropped out of a local public middle school when his father abruptly died in 1920, leaving the family destitute. Being one of the extremely few peasants who received some education, he was elected by the local peasants as their representatives in their struggle against the brutal oppression of local landlords. As a result, he was deeply feared and hated by local strongmen such as Xie Guannan (). In 1923, Xie Guannan had Yuan Wencai&#x27;s home ransacked, house burned down, his elder brother imprisoned, his wife raped and then enslaved, while his mother murdered execution style. The local strongmen were able to bribe the corrupted local government and had Yuan Wencai as wanted criminal. This marked the end of Yuan&#x27;s struggle for welfare of the local peasants in legal means. The young Yuan Wencai, then in his early twenties, fled into the mountains and joined a group of brigands calling themselves the &quot;Horse and Sword Brigade&quot; () headed by Hu Yachun (). Yuan Wencai soon proved himself and it was not long before he became the leader of bandits. They operated in the hills of Jinggangshan, particularly around Ningang county, and had close ties with the &quot;Green Forest&quot; () bandits based on higher terrain, led by Wang Zuo. Yuan Wencai proved to be a better leader than Wang Zuo in that he had managed to win greater support of local peasants, and in 1924, Yuan&#x27;s band attacked and took the town of Ninggang (), burned down the governmental administrative building.

The Jiangxi provincial government sent in a battalion to eradicate Yuan&#x27;s force, but due to the completely lack of support of local population which cheered Yuan&#x27;s action, not only the campaign had failed to eradicate Yuan&#x27;s force and resulted in defeat, but also suffered heavy casualties, though a great portion of the casualties suffered by the governmental force was due to illness. The failed governmental attempt increased Yuan&#x27;s reputation among local peasants. In 1925, Wang Zuo was forced to flee to Yuan Wencai&#x27;s turf due to a coup staged by his subordinates, and Yuan helped Wang to defeat his opponents and firmly reestablished Wang&#x27;s position as the chief of the band. The two became sworn brothers and strategically positioned their forces to secure their bases in Jinggangshan. Yuan&#x27;s force was stationed at the foothills at Maoping, while Wang&#x27;s force was stationed in the mountains at higher elevation at Greater and Lesser Five Wells (Daxiaowujing ).

==Early communist years==
From the summer of 1925, Yuan Wencai began to have contact with representatives of the Chinese Communist Party via the Ninggang () communist You Chaoqing (). In September, 1925, Yuan&#x27;s force was reorganized as the Ninggang Security Regiment with Yuan as the regimental commander, and this is the first armed force in China that was under the control of Chinese Communist Party. In October 1926, during the Northern Expedition, he organized an attack on Ninggang county, deposed the local county chief Shen Qingyuan () of the Beiyang clique of warlords, while seizing weapons and securing the area for the Communists. In November of that year, he became a member of the Communist Party, and his men were reorganized as a peasant self-defence force. After the appointment of a new county chief by the newly established Republican government at Nanjing.

After April 12 Incident, Yuan Wencai, like Wang Zuo, decided to stay with communist side, and became the only two surviving communist forces locally, each had around sixty rifles respectively. Both Yuan and Wang adopted new strategies when they resumed their banditry activities for survival in that they had only targeted the richest landlords and merchants who were mostly hated by the general population. In doing so, they had managed not only to win the support of lower and lower-middle classes, but also that of many members of the middle class such as small business owners. Consequently, this successful practice also became the source of their crimes they were accused of in their subsequent downfall, when their future comrades accused them for being &quot;Not carrying out the revolution completely&quot; and &quot;Being rightist&quot;. Due to the popular support from those with better economic status, the communists were able to secure a steady supply of provisions needed via trade, and helped with properties confiscated from the richest local strongmen, the communists became bolder and concentrated on guerrilla warfare against local governmental forces which were incapable of exterminating Yuan&#x27;s and Wang&#x27;s forces due to the strong popular support the communists enjoyed. In July, 1927, under the order of communists, Yuan&#x27;s men and Wang&#x27;s men raided Yongxin County, freeing over 80 Communist Party agents held in the local jail converted from a gaol. Although the town was briefly occupied, it was obvious that it was impossible for the token communist force to hold the town and thus they soon withdrew to the mountains to continue their guerrilla warfare.

==Joining Mao Zedong==
On September 30, 1927, Mao Zedong arrived at Sanwan (三湾) village of Yongxin (永新) county, just north of Jinggangshan, with the remnants from the abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising, and sent letters to both Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo to ask their help to establish a communist base locally. On October 3, 1927, Mao&#x27;s force reached the town of Ninggang (宁冈) and held a conference, at which Mao personally vetoed the suggestion to eliminate Yuan and Wang by force. At first Yuan Wencai was suspicious of Mao and lay an ambush on the mountain road to Ninggang to defend his turf. Accompanied by You Chaoqing (尤超清), Mao went to meet Yuan on October 6, 1927, at Dacang (大仓) village near Maoping (茅坪), and convinced Yuan to join his men. Mao gave more than a hundred rifles to Yuan and in return, Yuan gave over a thousand silver dollars to Mao. The next day, Yuan personally held a ceremony to welcome Mao and his men to Maoping (茅坪). Yuan had his bodyguard Li Genjin (李根勤) accompany Mao to Maoping, where they set up military headquarters. Yuan subsequently helped to gather five tons of grains and a huge amount of cloth to Mao&#x27;s men, and helped to established the first military hospital in the communist base.

That winter Yuan&#x27;s men drilled together with the Communists and were further indoctrinated in Marxist political theory, when Mao sent cadres including Xu Yangang (徐彦刚), You Xuecheng (游雪程), and Chen Bojun (陈伯钧) to help Yuan. In February 1928, the forces of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were officially incorporated into the regular Communist army as the 1st Army, 1st Division, 2nd Regiment. Yuan was named as the regimental commander, and Wang as the deputy regimental commander, with He Changgong as the communist party representative (何长工). They participated in a successful attack at Xincheng on a battalion of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Jiangxi Army, killing the enemy commander and taking more than a hundred prisoners. In the spring of 1928 Yuan Wencai introduced the sister of a classmate, He Zizhen, to Mao Zedong. The couple began living together soon afterwards, much to the delight of Yuan. He cooked them a nuptial supper, apparently hoping that the partnership would commit Mao more strongly to the area&#x27;s defence.

Soon afterwards, he accompanied Mao Zedong to Lingxian county in southern Hunan province in aid of Zhu De. Jinggangshan had meanwhile been overrun by landlord militia and had to be reconquered. After Zhu De&#x27;s soldiers joined the Jinggangshan base, they were merged with the existing forces to become the Fourth &quot;Red Army&quot;. Yuan and Wang&#x27;s 2nd Regiment was renamed the 32nd Regiment. Later in the year, Zhu De&#x27;s 28th and 29th regiments crossed into Hunan. The 32nd Regiment was given the assignment of securing Maoping from the advance of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Jiangxi units until his return.

In January 1929, the bulk of the Red Army left Jinggangshan to establish a new base at Ruijin, leaving around 800 ex-Kuomintang troops under Peng Dehuai. Just after the New Year, it was agreed that Peng&#x27;s men and the 32nd Regiment of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai should stay behind to defend Jinggangshan. Under intense pressure for about a week, Peng gathered together his three surviving companies and broke through the enemy blockade with heavy casualties. For the next year Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo survived with their men in the mountains and may have returned to banditry in their guerrilla warfare. The Kuomintang&#x27;s repeated mop up operations against them proved to be futile because the communist forces only confiscated property from wealthy landlords, and distributing to peasants. As a result, such banditry was viewed positively by the local general populace, which refused to corporate with the Kuomintang forces.

==Prelude to downfall==
Jinggangshan and Jiangxi Soviet were not immune to the power struggles within the Chinese Communist Party in the early 1930s. Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan succeeded in rising to power under the direction and support of the Comintern and their extreme leftist policy inevitably effected all communist bases in China, including Jinggangshan. The extreme leftism of the new communist leadership included what Mao Zedong called &quot;military adventurism&quot;, which included attempts to take over the large cities, a result of unrealistic optimism on the Chinese revolution and a direct copy of the Soviet model of urban revolution.

The new strategy was obvious unfit for China at the time, and many commanders such as Peng Dehuai, Zhu De and Chen Yi voiced their opposition, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai included, but it was useless because the new leadership refused to change its policy. As a result, the communist forces met disastrous defeats in attempts to carry out this unrealistic policy. Mao Zedong strongly opposed the military adventurism of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan, but lost and was temporarily forced out of the communist leadership and sent to southern Jiangxi. Although Mao&#x27;s new position appeared to have the equal rank, in reality Mao was demoted, and could not protect Yuan and Wang, and his other protégés as he used to. Furthermore, during the 6th National Conference of Chinese Communist Party held from June to July, 1928 in Moscow, the top brass of communists passed the resolution on the &quot;Organizational Problems of Soviet Government&quot;, in which it clearly stated that the bandits could only be utilized before the success of uprising, but afterward, they must be eliminated. This resolution had provided excellent ammo for Li Lisan and Xiang Zhongfa in their power struggle against Mao, and people like Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo were obviously targets.

However, the political struggle did not end at the top leadership of the communists. In contrast to the professional soldier Peng Dehuai who faithfully attempted to carry out the impossible missions by dutifully obeying the orders despite his personal opposition, which of course ended in obvious defeats, Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only voiced their opposition in words, but also carried it out in action by simply refusing to obey the unrealistic orders from the new communist party leadership and continued to practice Mao Zedong&#x27;s strategy. The result of their actions was the obvious success that enabled Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to have most of their force preserved. However, the relative success of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai not only proved to be useless in helping them within the communist party, but it also served as a catalyst of their downfall because their success of preserving their own forces was viewed as an urgent threat by the new communist leadership, since with greater military force, it was more difficult to remove them politically. With their primary supporter and protector Mao Zedong falling out from power, Wang Zuo&#x27;s and Yuan Wencai&#x27;s days were numbered.

When the resolution from the communist 6th National Conference held in the mid-1928 in Moscow reached the communist base in Jinggangshan, it was already winter. In the beginning of 1929, Mao held the Bailu (柏露) Conference to discuss the issue. Wang Huai (王怀), the communist party secretary of Yongxin (永新) county and You Chaoqing (尤超清), the communist party secretary of Ninggang (宁冈) county, who had been at odds with Yuan and Wang insisted on executing Yuan and Wang according to the resolution but their suggestion was once again vetoed by Mao. The resulting decision was that Wang would remain to command forces in the communist base, while Yuan would be named as the chief-of-staff and deployed with the communist force striking southern Jiangxi. During campaigns in southern Jiangxi, Yuan accidentally came across the resolution from Moscow at Donggu (东固), and although he feared for his life, he decided to prove himself by returning to the communist base in May, 1929, and he continued his service with communist faithfully, but this did not help.

==Death==
In the late night of February 23, 1930, Peng Dehuai was awakened from bed by Xiang Zhongfa&#x27;s and Li Lisan&#x27;s three lieutenants Zhu Changxie (朱昌偕) and Wang Huai (王怀), who told Peng that they had just received intelligence that claimed Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai, had defected to Kuomintang, and therefore they need Peng&#x27;s signature to deploy troops to exterminate the traitors. Ironically, one of the supporters of Zhu Changxie (朱昌偕) and Wang Huai (王怀), You Chaoqing (尤超清), was the one who introduced Wang and Yuan to the communists, and Peng knew full well that neither Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai would do such thing. Peng initially refused, and argued in defense of Wang and Yuan. The three lieutenants of Xiang Zhongfa and Li Lisan then changed their story, claiming that the intelligence indeed appeared to be a rumor, and that they needed to arrange a meeting with the two commanders to clear things up, and that some forces should be deployed just in case. Sensing Peng Dehuai&#x27;s opposition, the three also asked Peng not to become involved, to remaining where he was, instead of attending the planned meeting, for the sake of not agitating the situation. This tactic finally convinced Peng Dehuai to give his signature. Subsequently, the three men led over three hundred troops away to plot their next move.
After leaving Peng Dehuai&#x27;s camp, the three immediately faked Mao Zedong&#x27;s order to lure both Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai to the supposed meeting to discuss the military situation. But once Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai reached the meeting, they were shot in obscure circumstances, allegedly ambushed while trying to rebel. Wang managed to escape out a window but drowned whilst attempting to cross a river.

As early as October of that year, Mao Zedong criticized the officials in power of the Jiangxi Soviet for the assassination of his old allies. Just who gave the order for the death of Wang Zuo, however, is still not clear, although a number of officials of the Jiangxi Communist Party were implicated. Wang Yunlong (王雲隆), Wang Zuo&#x27;s younger brother and an officer of the 32nd Regiment, became the new leader of his brother&#x27;s men, and defected to Kuomintang, taking many former Yuan Wencai&#x27;s men with them. After Wang Yunlong&#x27;s death, Wang Zuo&#x27;s son became the leader and it was not until nearly two decades later in 1949 when the communists were finally able to retake Jinggangshan.

After 1949, both Yuan and Wang were marked as examples of ideologically reformed bandits who had been transformed into Communist soldiers. Both were recognised as martyrs of the Chinese Revolution. When Zhu De visited Jinggangshan in 1962 and Mao Zedong in 1965, both called upon Yuan Wencai&#x27;s elderly widow Xie Meixiang (謝梅香). In 1986, his grave was moved to the newly constructed Jinggangshan Martyrs Cemetery. Although Peng Dehuai was not directly involved in the death of Yuan Wencai and Wang Zuo, as proved by the history, that did not prevent Mao Zedong from blaming the affair on Peng. Peng Dehuai was persecuted thirty years later for the death of Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai. This was one of the alleged crime Peng committed against Mao, and this alleged crime again appeared during the Cultural Revolution when Peng Dehuai was struggled by the Red Guards.

<text>For My Pain... is a gothic metal supergroup from Oulu, Finland, featuring members from Embraze, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Nightwish, Charon and Reflexion. The band released their debut studio album, &quot;Fallen&quot;, in 2003.

== History ==
The idea of For My Pain... started in 1999, when Altti Veteläinen and Petri Sankala, both from Eternal Tears of Sorrow, wanted to start a new project. They asked two old friends, Tuomas Holopainen and Lauri Tuohimaa, to join. All parties were interested, but as everyone was too busy, the project was postponed.

A few years later the idea came up again, this time with a better timing since both Eternal Tears of Sorrow and Nightwish were having breaks. Two new members were asked to join, Olli-Pekka Törrö and Juha Kylmänen, and the band started recording their debut album in 2001.

For My Pain...&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; was released in 2003. Finnish music magazine &quot;Soundi&quot; gave the album three out of five stars. In 2004, the band released a single, &quot;Killing Romance&quot;, which peaked at number seven on the official Finnish single chart.

On 13 December 2023, the band announced their reunion, alongside a show planned for 3 May 2024, and the promise of new music in 2024. They released the single, &quot;Recoil into Darkness&quot;, on 12 April 2024.

<doc id="1117589" wikidata="Q32281" url="?curid=1117589" title="Closure (video)">
<text>Closure is the first video album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on November 25, 1997. The double VHS set consists of one tape of live concert and behind-the-scenes footage from their Self-Destruct and Further Down the Spiral tours and one tape of music videos.

The first cassette&#x27;s footage highlights tour footage and backstage antics by Nine Inch Nails and their tour guests: Marilyn Manson, Jim Rose Circus and David Bowie. One segment, in particular, is dedicated to Reznor&#x27;s penchant at the time for violently destroying keyboards and other tour equipment each show, which was directed by Jonathan Rach.

The music videos on the second cassette are interspersed with snippets from educational films, as well as exclusive footage shot by Peter Christopherson which is reminiscent of the video for &quot;Closer&quot;; these segments include remixed music from the band&#x27;s back catalogue, most prominently featuring &quot;A Warm Place&quot; and &quot;The Art of Self Destruction, Final&quot;. &quot;Closure&quot; also contains snippets of the non-commercially released &quot;Broken&quot; film. Footage from the Edison Manufacturing Company film &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot; is shown before &quot;March of the Pigs&quot;.

According to Russell Mills, who created the artwork, a live album was also planned as a companion to &quot;Closure&quot; and artwork was made for it, but the idea was scrapped.

It contains over 90 minutes of additional footage compared to the prior VHS release. The deluxe two-disc DVD set, though finished and ready for authoring and release, has been indefinitely postponed by Interscope Records.

A teaser trailer shown on the NIN website included new footage from the 1989 tour, Lollapalooza, Woodstock &#x27;94, clips from the making of the &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; videos, and the unreleased, original versions of the &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; videos.

===Availability===
In 2006, Disc 1 of a so-called &quot;prototype&quot; edition of the DVD set appeared on the BitTorrent site The Pirate Bay, including the aforementioned bonus content and a still image gallery. The torrent also contains the artwork from the promotional poster that was rendered for the DVD, containing more detail than the original VHS cover. Disc 2 later appeared, including behind-the-scenes footage of the &quot;Closer&quot; video with commentary by Mark Romanek. Both of these discs were submitted to The Pirate Bay (along with the &quot;Broken&quot; movie DVD &quot;leak&quot;) by a user known only as seed0.

Fans speculate that Reznor may have been the source of this leak, based on a post on his official blog: &quot;12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn&#x27;t say that out loud). If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, cool.&quot; This was later alluded to by Reznor, tongue-in cheek, during an interview: &quot;A couple of years ago around this time of year, somebody must have broken into my personal files and uploaded onto a torrent site the entire DVD of Closure[...] So that basically means that it doesn&#x27;t need to come out on DVD anymore.&quot;

In March 2013, Nine Inch Nails made the tour documentary portion of &quot;Closure&quot; available for streaming via Vimeo.

<text>Battle&#x27;s sign, also known as mastoid ecchymosis, is an indication of fracture of middle cranial fossa of the skull. These fractures may be associated with underlying brain trauma. Battle&#x27;s sign consists of bruising over the mastoid process as a result of extravasation of blood along the path of the posterior auricular artery. The sign is named after William Henry Battle.

Battle&#x27;s sign takes at least one day to appear after the initial traumatic basilar skull fracture, similar to raccoon eyes. It is usually seen after head injuries resulting in injury to mastoid process leading to bruising.

Battle&#x27;s sign may be confused with a spreading hematoma from a fracture of the mandibular condyle, which is a less serious injury.

<text>Gordon William Allport (November 11, 1897 – October 9, 1967) was an American psychologist. Allport was one of the first psychologists to focus on the study of the personality, and is often referred to as one of the founding figures of personality psychology. He contributed to the formation of values scales and rejected both a psychoanalytic approach to personality, which he thought often was too deeply interpretive, and a behavioral approach, which he thought did not provide deep enough interpretations from their data. Instead of these popular approaches, he developed an eclectic theory based on traits. He emphasized the uniqueness of each individual, and the importance of the present context, as opposed to history, for understanding the personality.

Allport had a profound and lasting influence on the field of psychology, even though his work is cited much less often than that of other well-known figures. Part of his influence stemmed from his knack for exploring and broadly conceptualizing important topics (e.g. rumor, prejudice, religion, traits). Another part of his influence resulted from the deep and lasting impression he made on his students during his long teaching career, many of whom went on to have important careers in psychology. Among his many students were Jerome S. Bruner, Anthony Greenwald, Stanley Milgram, Leo Postman, Thomas Pettigrew, and M. Brewster Smith. His brother Floyd Henry Allport, was professor of social psychology and political psychology at Syracuse University&#x27;s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (in Syracuse, New York) from 1924 until 1956, and visiting professor at University of California, Berkeley. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Allport as the 11th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Biography ==

Allport grew up in a religious family of Christian missionaries. He was born in Montezuma, Indiana, and was the youngest of four sons of John Edward and Nellie Edith (Wise) Allport. When Gordon Allport was six years old, the family had already moved many times and finally settled in Ohio. His early education was in the public schools of Cleveland, Ohio.

John Allport was a country doctor and had his clinic and hospital in the family home. Allport&#x27;s father turned their home into a makeshift hospital, with patients as well as nurses residing there. Gordon Allport and his brothers grew up surrounded by their father&#x27;s patients, nurses, and medical equipment, and he and his brothers often assisted their father in the clinic. Allport reported that &quot;Tending office, washing bottles, and dealing with patients were important aspects of my early training&quot; (p. 172). During this time, Allport&#x27;s father was encapsulated in a blurb in Samuel Hopkins Adams&#x27; exposé in Collier&#x27;s Magazine on fraudulent medicinal cures, later reprinted as the book &quot;The Great American Fraud: Articles on the Nostrum Evil and Quackery&quot;. While much of the book focuses on large scale, heavily advertised patent medicines available at the turn of the century, the author states Allport &quot;would never have embodied this article were it not for the efforts of certain physicians of Cleveland.&quot; Allport was criticized for diagnosing and treating morphine addicts via mail simply on the basis of letters and no in-person appointments. Upon receiving Adams&#x27; letter detailing his concocted affliction, Allport replied back via mail, diagnosing Adams as a morphine addict and sending doses of the &quot;Dr. J. Edward Allport System,&quot; designed to cure morphine addicts. Analysis of the medicine revealed its active ingredient to be nothing more than additional morphine, packed with a bottle of pink whiskey &quot;to mix with the morphin[sp] when it gets low.&quot; Adams referred to Allport as a &quot;[quack] who pretend[s] to be a physician,&quot; is &quot;no less scoundrelly,&quot; and &quot;is even more dangerous&quot; than other fraudulent addiction cure peddlers mentioned earlier in the book.

Allport&#x27;s mother was a former school teacher, who forcefully promoted her values of intellectual development and religion.

Biographers describe Allport as a reserved and diligent young boy who lived a fairly isolated childhood. As a teenager, Allport developed and managed his own printing business while serving as an editor of his high school newspaper. In 1915, he graduated second in his class at Glenville High School at the age of eighteen which earned him a scholarship that allowed him to attend Harvard University. Notably, one of his older brothers, Floyd Henry Allport, was working on his Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard.

Allport earned his A.B. degree in 1919 in Philosophy and Economics (not psychology).

After graduating from Harvard, Allport traveled to Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, where he taught economics and philosophy for a year, before returning to Harvard to pursue his Ph.D. in psychology on a fellowship in 1920. His first publication, &quot;Personality Traits: Their Classification and Measurement&quot; in 1921, was co-authored with his older brother, Floyd Henry Allport. Allport earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1921, studying under Herbert Langfeld, and then his Ph.D. in 1922, along the way taking a class with Hugo Münsterberg before the latter&#x27;s death in 1916.

Harvard then awarded Allport a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. He spent the first Sheldon year studying with the new Gestalt School in Berlin and Hamburg, Germany; and then the second year at Cambridge University.

In 1921 through 1937, Allport helped establish personality as a psychological research type within American psychology. He returned to Harvard as an instructor in psychology from 1924 to 1926 where he began teaching his course &quot;Personality: Its Psychological and Social Aspects&quot; in 1924. During this time, Allport married Ada Lufkin Gould, who was a clinical psychologist. Together they had one child, a boy, who later became a pediatrician. After going to teach introductory courses on social psychology and personality at Dartmouth College for four years, Allport returned to Harvard and remained there for the rest of his career.

Allport was a member of the faculty at Harvard University from 1930 to 1967. In 1931, he served on the faculty committee that established Harvard&#x27;s Sociology Department. In the late 1940s, he helped to develop an introductory course for the new Social Relations Department. At that time, he was also editor of the &quot;Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology&quot;. Allport was also a Director of the Commission for the United Nations Educational Scientific, and Cultural Organization. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1933.

By 1937, Allport began to act as a spokesman for personality psychology. He appeared on radio talk shows, wrote literature reviews, articles, and a textbook. He was elected President of the American Psychological Association in 1939, being the second youngest person to hold that office. In 1943, he was elected President of the Eastern Psychological Association. In 1944, he served as President of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. In 1950, Allport published his third book titled &quot;The Individual and His Religion&quot;. His fourth book, &quot;The Nature of Prejudice&quot;, was published in 1954, based on his work with refugees during World War II. His fifth book, published in 1955, was titled &quot;Becoming: Basic Considerations for Psychology of Personality&quot;. In 1963, Allport was awarded the Gold Medal Award from the American Psychological Foundation. In the following year, he received the APA&#x27;s Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. Gordon Allport died on October 9, 1967, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of lung cancer, just one month shy of his 70th birthday.

==Allport&#x27;s trait theory==

Allport contributed to the trait theory of personality, and is known as a &quot;trait&quot; psychologist. He opposed the idea that people can be classified according to a small number of trait dimensions, arguing that each person is unique and distinguished by particular traits. In his work, &quot;Concepts of Trait and Personality (1927)&quot;, Allport states that traits are &quot;habits possessed of social significance&quot; and become very predictable, traits are a unit of personality. Allport emphasized that an individual&#x27;s personality is the single most unique thing about a person.

One of his early projects was to go through the dictionary and locate every term that he thought could describe a person. From this, he developed a list of 4500 trait-like words. He organized these words into three levels of traits. This is similar to Goldberg&#x27;s fundamental lexical hypothesis, or the hypothesis that humans develop widely used, generic terms for individual differences in their daily interactions over time.

Allport&#x27;s three-level hierarchy of traits are:

1. Cardinal trait - These traits are rare but is the trait that dominates and shapes a person&#x27;s behavior. They exert a powerful influence on behavior which becomes aspects of a person&#x27;s identity. These are the ruling passions/obsessions, such as a need for money, fame, etc.

2. Central trait - These traits are general characteristics found in some degree in every person. These are the basic building blocks that shape most of our behavior although they are not as overwhelming as cardinal traits. They influence but do not determine behavior. An example of a central trait would be honesty.

3. Secondary trait - These traits are the bottom tier of the hierarchy and are not as apparent as central traits (less influential). Secondary traits are characteristics seen only in certain circumstances (such as particular likes or dislikes that a very close friend may know). They must be included to provide a complete picture of human complexity.

Overall, Allport&#x27;s three-level hierarchy of traits provides a framework for understanding the different levels of traits that collectively shape an individual&#x27;s personality.

==The Development of the Proprium==

=== 1. Sense of bodily &quot;me&quot; (first year) ===
It is perceived when infants can understand themselves through sensations and figure out what makes them and what does not.

=== 2. Sense of self-identity (second year) ===
Though understanding whom they are by having a significance in their name has. This can then give them a sense of how they are and what that can mean socially.

=== 3. Sense of self-esteem (third year) ===
With having a sense of who they are in this stage, they want to have a form of independence that can be stepped away from adult supervision.

=== 4. Sense of self-extension (Fourth year) ===
In this stage, the child can see their bodies and extend to toys. The words that seem to be stated in their mind is mine.

=== 5. Emergence of self-image (fourth to the sixth year) ===
There seems to be an awareness of the good me and the bad me for the children that can bring up what they expect others to expect from them. In this stage, certain goals they see for themselves are brought up.

=== 6. Emergence of self as a rational coper (sixth to twelfth year) ===
At this stage, it is brought to the awareness that thoughts can help solve problems in which they tend to think a lot about their thinking.

=== 7. Emergence of proproate striving (twelfth year through adolescence) ===
In this stage, it is believed that future goals are built to give a sense of meaning to one&#x27;s life. Allport viewed a healthy person to create problems by making future goals that can be seen as unattainable in many cases. This sense of creating these long-term goals is set to differentiate from other stages and even from having a healthy or sick personality.

=== 8. Emergence of self as knower (adulthood) ===
In this final stage, the self is seen as a knower who can be aware of and surpass the seven other propriate functions. When gone through all stages, you appear to use several or even all in daily tasks and experiences 

==Genotypes and phenotypes==
Allport hypothesized the idea of internal and external forces that influence an individual&#x27;s behavior. He called these forces Genotypes and Phenotypes.
Genotypes are internal forces that relate to how a person retains information and uses it to interact with the external world. Phenotypes are external forces, these relate to the way an individual accepts his surroundings and how others influence their behavior. These forces generate the ways in which we behave and are the groundwork for the creation of individual traits.

The Problem with this hypothesis is that it cannot be proven as they are internal theories, influenced presumably by the outer environment.

==Functional autonomy of motives==
Allport was one of the first researchers to draw a distinction between Motive and Drive.
He suggested that a drive forms as a reaction to a motive, which may outgrow the motive as the reason for a behavior. The drive then becomes autonomous and distinct from the motive, whether the motive was instinct or something else. The idea that drives can become independent of the original motives for a given behavior is known as &quot;functional autonomy.&quot;

Allport gives the example of a man who seeks to perfect his task or craft. His original motive may be a sense of inferiority engrained in his childhood, but his diligence in his work and the motive it acquires, later on, is a need to excel in his chosen profession, which becomes the man&#x27;s drive. Allport says that the theory:

... avoids the absurdity of regarding the energy of life now, in the present, as somehow consisting of early archaic forms (instincts, prepotent reflexes, or the never-changing Id). Learning brings new systems of interests into existence just as it does new abilities and skills. At each stage of development, these interests are always contemporary; whatever drives, drives now.

<text>Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix is a Dark Horse Comics limited series starring the fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones. It was the seventh &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; limited series by Dark Horse, and the sixth about the adult Indiana. The comic was based on a canceled LucasArts video game, a sequel to &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; (which was also the first Dark Horse &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; comic).

==Plot==
The comic is set after World War II, with the Nazis seeking the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone in an attempt to resurrect dead Nazis. Along with the beautiful Russian major Nadia, Indiana Jones gathers the pieces of the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

==Development==
The reasons for the game&#x27;s cancellation included the clash between the drawing styles of the characters (art deco) and of the background (realistic), the retiring from the project of Aric Wilmunder, the main programmer, and finally, the problems with distribution in Germany, where censorship laws prohibit the sale of any products with explicit depictions of Nazi symbols. Earlier games could get away easily by simply removing the Nazi flags and references to them, but this could not be done with this game, as they were an important part of the plot and Hitler was featured as a central villain.

After this game, LucasArts briefly considered making a game named &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot; (involving the spear of Longinus). They eventually abandoned the idea of creating a classical adventure game in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, instead focusing on &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;-style 3D action games, beginning with the release of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, followed by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings&quot;.

==Comic book==
Even though the game was canceled, Dark Horse Comics released a four-part comic book series based upon the game&#x27;s script. A comic book was also created for the canceled game &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot;.

<text>Look What I Did is an American band, formed in 2001 in Nashville, Tennessee. The band is known for its intense live show, described by &quot;Cincinnati CityBeat&quot; as a &quot;live act capable of unleashing a scary, uncontrolled intensity bordering on dangerous&quot;, and oft-satirical eccentric lyrics.

==History==
In 2003, the band added a second guitar player, Aaron &quot;Skeet&quot; Childress, formerly of National Green, and moved to Los Angeles. At this time it also released it first recording, an independently recorded, financed and released LP, &quot;My First Time&quot;, on its own Clockrock Recordings. Despite its limited pressing, the record was reported in ezines such as &quot;theprp.com&quot;, &quot;Loudside&quot;, and &quot;Opuszine&quot;. 

In early 2008, the band signed a deal with the new label Modernist Movement. &quot;Atlas Drugged&quot; was released on February 9, 2010, by Modernist Movement Recordings. &quot;Atlas Drugged&quot; was produced by Brian Virtue. &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine referred to the band in a review of &quot;Atlas Drugged&quot;, &quot;Look What I Did crush on political philosophers, put Latin words in their song titles and generally get off on being a bunch of wiseasses to spazzed-out Adderall punk.&quot;

&quot;Zanzibar III: Analog Prison&quot; was named the Best Metal Album of 2015 by &quot;The Nashville Scene&quot;.

The band released a full new song &quot;If I Were You I Wouldn&#x27;t&quot; in January 2016 on its &quot;YouTube account&quot;, followed by &quot;Fireball&quot; in June 2016, the first songs released since &quot;Zanzibar III : Analog Prison&quot;.

The band was named after friend&#x27;s child said the phrase, &quot;Mommy, look what I did,&quot; to her mother about a drawing when Donegan was talking to her over the phone discussing what the band&#x27;s name should be.

In September 2020, the band announced that Evan Brewer had joined on bass guitar, replacing Chad Omen, with new music underway in the studio.

<text>Gen. Czesław Piątas (born 20 March 1946) is a Polish general, former Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army. He is one of the authors of the plan of modernisation of the Polish armed forces and one of the architects of its integration with the structures of NATO.

==Biography==
Czesław Piątas was born in Hausach, Germany. In September 1965 he joined the Polish Army and the Armour Officer&#x27;s School in Poznań. After he graduated in 1968, he was promoted to the rank of ensign (&quot;podporucznik&quot;) and assigned to the 8th Tank Regiment of Żagań-based Polish 11th Armoured Division as a tank platoon commander. In 1971 he was promoted to first lieutenant (&quot;porucznik&quot;) and the following year he assumed command over a company of tanks in the same regiment.

For the good effects of his work on the post of a tank commander, in 1974 Piątas was sent to Moscow, where he joined the &quot;Kliment Voroshilov Academy of Tank Troops&quot;. One of the best students at his course, in 1975 he was promoted to captain. In 1977 he graduated and was instantly assigned to the staff of the 11th Armoured Division, where he accomplished his probation.

In 1978 he became the chief of staff and deputy commanding officer of the 3rd Tank Regiment of the 11th Division. The following year Piątas was promoted to major. In 1980 he joined the 10th Tank Regiment of the Polish 10th Armoured Division, of which he also was the chief of staff. The unit under his command won many military awards, including the title of a &quot;leading unit of the Silesian Military District&quot;, which won Piątas a promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1982. The following year he became the chief of staff and deputy commanding officer of the Opole-based 10th Armoured Division. He served on that post until 1986, when he was promoted to colonel and yet again sent to Moscow for training.

There he joined the General Staff Academy of the USSR. He graduated in 1982 and was assigned to the Headquarters of the Silesian Military Area, and in 1986 was given the command of Polish 4th Mechanised Division. Upon his return in 1988, Piątas settled in Wrocław, where he became the Chief of Operations and the deputy commander of the Silesian Military District. In 1991 he left that post and became the commander of the Polish 4th Armoured Division dislocated in Krosno Odrzańskie. He distinguished himself as a brilliant organizer and in 1992 his division received the title of &quot;The Leading Unit of the Polish Army&quot; - the highest peacetime award a tactical unit can achieve. The same year he was promoted by president Lech Wałęsa to the rank of brigadier general (&quot;generał brygady&quot;) and in 1993 he returned to the headquarters of the Silesian Military District, where he resumed his previous post of Chief of Operations and deputy commander.

In 1996 he was moved to Warsaw, where he assumed the post of chief of staff of the Warsaw Military District. In January 1997 he was assigned to the General Staff of the Polish Army as the Chief of Operational and Strategic Command. As such he was one of the Polish officers who took part in the Polish-NATO accession talks in 1997-1998. After that he travelled to United States. There he settled in Washington, D.C. and joined the National War College. He graduated in 1999 and returned to Warsaw, where he became the deputy Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army.

On 15 August 1999 he was promoted by president Aleksander Kwaśniewski to major general (&quot;generał dywizji&quot;). On 28 September 2000 Piątas became the Chief of General Staff and was promoted to lieutenant general (&quot;generał broni&quot;). On 15 August 2002 Piątas was promoted to the rank of general (&quot;generał&quot;). On 25 September 2003 he was reappointed to another three-year term as Chief of General Staff. He retired from active service in January 2006.

In January 2008 he became Deputy Minister of Defense in Donald Tusk&#x27;s government.

<doc id="1117626" wikidata="Q2304714" url="?curid=1117626" title="Triumph 2000">
<text>The Triumph 2000 is a mid-sized, rear wheel drive automobile which was produced in Coventry by the Triumph Motor Company between 1963 and 1977. It was introduced on 15 October 1963. It was styled by Giovanni Michelotti. 

It competed with the contemporary Rover P6 2000, which initially was offered only with a four-cylinder engine. The Rover was also released in October 1963, just one week before the Triumph. Larger-engined models, known as the Triumph 2.5 PI and Triumph 2500 were also produced from 1968.

== Engine ==
The 2000 used the six-cylinder engine first seen in the Standard Vanguard at the end of 1960. However, the last of the six cylinder Vanguards had applied a compression ratio of 8.0:1 which the increasing availability of higher octane fuels enabled the manufacturers to increase to 8.5:1 for the Triumph. This and the fitting of twin Stromberg 150 CD carburettors made for a claimed power output increased to from the Vanguard&#x27;s .

== Running gear ==
Standard transmission on the original car was a 4-speed manual gearbox: overdrive and Borg-Warner Type 35 3-speed automatic transmission were options. The unitary body had independent suspension all-round with semi-trailing arms at the rear, all using coil springs. The servo-assisted brakes were disc at the front and drums at the rear.
==Triumph 2000 Mk 1 &amp; 2.5 PI Mk 1 ==
The Mk 1 was presented to the public at the London Motor Show in October 1963, and volume sales began in January 1964. Continuing in production until 1969, this version came in saloon and, from 1965, estate forms. The estate car body shell was partly built by Carbodies, and in the Mk 1 version was the same length as the saloon. Various minor improvements were made during the period of which the most noteworthy, probably, was a significant upgrade in October 1966 to the &quot;previously rather ineffective&quot; ventilation, with eyeball vents added in the centre of the facia and the heater controls repositioned beneath them.

In October 1968 the 2.5 PI (petrol injection) Mk 1 was launched, fitted with a Lucas Automotive mechanical fuel injection system. Performance was very good, but the PI models (along with the TR6 models) gained a reputation for unreliability and poor fuel economy.

In Australia, these models suffered badly because of the summer heat. The electric fuel pump commonly overheated causing fuel to vaporise and render the engine inoperable until the pump cooled down. The overheating of the pump was caused by a combination of very high pressure fuel loads (over ) and a pump that was adapted from what was originally a windscreen wiper motor. As such, it did not cope well with sustained pressures in moderate to high ambient temperatures. Because of the launch late in the Mk I&#x27;s life, there are relatively few PIs in the original shape.


== Triumph 2000 Mk 2, 2.5 PI Mk 2, 2500TC and 2500S ==
In October 1969, the Mk 2 range was launched, styled, like its predecessor, by Michelotti, and preparing the car for the 1970s. The front of the car now followed the lines of the then-upcoming Triumph Stag grand tourer. There were entry-level 2000 models, which were the most plentiful, but the remainder of the range consisted of 2500, 2500 TC and 2500 PI models. Apart from the PI (petrol injection) models, all Triumph 2000 and 2500s had twin Stromberg or SU carburettors, the &quot;TC&quot; suffix on some models can seem misleading in this respect as it stood for a higher equipment level. In June 1975 the 2500S model, with 14 inch (356 mm) wheels and anti-roll bar, was added: it replaced the 2.5PI which had quietly disappeared from the show rooms two months earlier. This marked the end of fuel injected engines for the car, but improved acceleration was claimed for the twin carburettor 2500S and its slightly less expensive 2500TC sibling. These new versions featured an extensive list of other, mostly minor, improvements, of which the most significant were probably those affecting the ride and handling: these resulted from suspension changes including an anti-roll bar. The Estate in the Mk 2 version was 5 inches (125 mm) shorter than the Mk 2 Saloon, because the rear bodywork of the car was carried over unchanged from the Mk 1 version, and as with the Mk 1, built by Carbodies.

The Mk 2, the last big Triumph car, ceased production in 1977, supplanted by British Leyland&#x27;s corporate executive car, the Rover SD1. Six-cylinder 2300 and 2600 versions of the new Rover would nonetheless be powered by engines designed by Triumph, originally intended to replace the older 2000 / 2500 units. The last production car, a 2500S estate (BOL87V) is kept at the Heritage Motor Centre.


==Overseas assembly==
Various models were assembled in South Africa, with the later 2500TC and 2500S being badged Triumph Chicane in that market between 1973 and 1978.

In New Zealand, CKD production of the Triumph 2000 continued at New Zealand Motor Corporation&#x27;s Nelson plant, with 2500S models until March 1979. Sir Rob Muldoon, New Zealand&#x27;s then Prime Minister, privately owned a white 2500S and had been known to drive to work in it. This car is now owned by a member of the Auckland Triumph Car Club.

The 2000 was assembled in Australia by Australian Motor Industries. A special version of the Mk 1 was known as the 2000MD (&quot;Managing Director&quot;), which had special features such as knock-off wire wheels, triple Stromberg carburettors, and the battery moved to the boot. Total production of the 2000MD was approximately 100.

==Today==
Many of these cars are still on the road, supported by owners clubs and specialist parts.

The 2000 and derivatives are also popular with modifiers owing to common parts and engines shared with other Triumph models such as the TR6, GT6, and Vitesse.

==Motor sport==
Factory-entered 2.5 PIs finished 2nd and 4th in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally.

<text>John Pell Coster Train (May 25, 1928 – August 13, 2022) was an American investment advisor and writer. He was a founding editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

==Early life==
Train was born on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Helen Coster Gerard and Arthur Train. His father was a district attorney in New York City and the author of the popular &quot;Ephraim Tutt&quot; stories that appeared in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the 1930s and 1940s. He graduated from Groton School in 1946. He graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1950 and a Master of Arts in 1951. He was editor of &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; and president of the Signet Society. In 1953, he co-founded and became the first managing editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, which won attention by publishing extended interviews with such authors as Ernest Hemingway, Thornton Wilder and William Faulkner.

==Career==
Train served in the U.S. Army. After working in Wall Street, he founded the New York investment counsel firm now known as Train, Babcock Advisors. During this period, he became the principal owner of Château Malescasse, a Cru Bourgeois wine producer in Lamarque, Gironde in France. He was chairman of the Montrose Group, investment advisers and tax accountants, and was a director of a major emerging markets mutual fund. He was the founder-chairman of the Train Foundation, which since 2000 has annually awarded the Civil Courage Prize for &quot;steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk.&quot; The Prize was inspired by the career of Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, with whom Train once worked closely. Asked whether he would prefer to receive the prize, or have it named after him, or be a judge, Solzhenitsyn chose the last, which he did to the end of his life. The trustees and directors of the Civil Courage Prize include five ambassadors: American, English and South African. He was an overseer of the Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University (affiliated with the United Nations), and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute of Strategic Studies (London). 

===Presidential appointments===
Train received part-time appointments from Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton as a director of government agencies and entities dealing with Africa, Asia, and Central Europe, respectively.

===Other distinctions===
Train had two decorations from the Italian government for humanitarian work, and was an officer of the (British) Order of St. John. In 1980, he helped to establish the Afghanistan Relief Committee to provide medicine and food to the victims of the Soviet invasion, serving first as its treasurer and later as president. The ARC merged with the International Rescue Committee, whose board he joined. He was an original trustee of the American University in Bulgaria.

==Personal life==
Train was a descendant of an old New England family, he was a cousin of the late United States Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and of Russell E. Train, head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under Richard Nixon and a founding trustee/former chairman of the World Wildlife Fund. John Train&#x27;s siblings include ambassadors, military officers and other officials.

Train married Maria Teresa Cini di Pianzano; they had two daughters and later divorced. In 1977, he married Francie Cheston. and had two more daughters. One of his children became an active member of his firm. Another daughter was married to Paul Klebnikov, a journalist murdered in Russia.

Train died on August 13, 2022, at a hospital in Rockport, Maine, aged 94.

==Select bibliography==
Train wrote several hundred columns in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, London&#x27;s &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and other publications. Also, about 25 books, translated into many languages, including:

<text>Öyle Bir Kadın Ki(&quot;She Is Such a Woman&quot;) (1979) is the first Turkish film which included a hardcore scene to be legally produced and distributed. 

The plot claims to deal with the sexual ambivalence of married couples on vacation, accompanied by a crime story. The movie started a short-lived, but intense period of pornography in Turkey until the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état. Today, it is difficult to find the original, uncut version. Directed by Naki Yurter (Yani Veligradino), the lead role was played by Zerrin Doğan.

<doc id="1117658" wikidata="Q1640064" url="?curid=1117658" title="Social model of disability">
<text>The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, derogatory attitudes, and social exclusion (intentional or inadvertent), which make it difficult or impossible for disabled people to attain their valued functionings. The social model of disability diverges from the dominant medical model of disability, which is a functional analysis of the body as a machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values. The medical model of disability carries with it a negative connotation, with negative labels associated with disabled people. The social model of disability seeks to challenge power imbalances within society between differently-abled people and seeks to redefine what disability means as a diverse expression of human life. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may result in individual functional differences, these do not necessarily have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people intentionally with respect to their individual needs. The origin of the approach can be traced to the 1960s, and the specific term emerged from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

The social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms &quot;impairment&quot; and &quot;disability&quot;. In this model, the word &quot;impairment&quot; is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes) that affect a person, such as the inability to walk or breathe independently. It seeks to redefine &quot;disability&quot; to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equitable social and structural support according to disabled peoples&#x27; structural needs. As a simple example, if a person is unable to climb stairs, the medical model focuses on making the individual physically able to climb stairs. The social model tries to make stair-climbing unnecessary, such as by making society adapt to their needs, and assist them by replacing the stairs with a wheelchair-accessible ramp. According to the social model, the person remains disabled with respect to climbing stairs, but the disability is negligible and no longer disabling in that scenario, because the person can get to the same locations without climbing any stairs.

It celebrates a non-conformist approach to the concept of disability and confronts deficit thinking of disability, which is argued to sit alongside the lines of activism and identity of pride for individuals with disabilities.

==History==

=== Disability rights movement ===
There is a hint from before the 1970s that the interaction between disability and society was beginning to be considered. British politician and disability rights campaigner Alf Morris wrote in 1969 (emphasis added):The history of the social model of disability begins with the history of the disability rights movement. Around 1970, various groups in North America, including sociologists, disabled people, and disability-focused political groups, began to pull away from the accepted medical lens of viewing disability. Instead, they began to discuss things like oppression, civil rights, and accessibility. This change in discourse resulted in conceptualizations of disability that was rooted in social constructs.

In 1975, the UK organization Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) claimed: &quot;In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.&quot; This became known as the social interpretation, or social definition, of disability.

=== Mike Oliver ===
Following the UPIAS &quot;social definition of disability&quot;, in 1983 the disabled academic Mike Oliver coined the phrase &quot;social model of disability&quot; in reference to these ideological developments. Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS. Oliver&#x27;s seminal 1990 book &quot;The Politics of Disablement&quot; is widely cited as a major moment in the adoption of this model. The book included just three pages about the social model of disability.

=== Developments ===
The &quot;social model&quot; was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, the US, and other countries to include all disabled people, including those who have learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, or emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.

== Tool for cultural analysis ==
The social model has become a key tool in the analysis of the cultural representation of disability; from literature, to radio, to charity-imagery to cinema. The social model has become the key conceptual analysis in challenging, for examples, stereotypes and archetypes of disabled people by revealing how conventional imagery reinforces the oppression of disabled people. Key theorists include Paul Darke (cinema), Lois Keith (literature), Leonard Davis (Deaf culture), Jenny Sealey (theatre) and Mary-Pat O&#x27;Malley (radio).

==Components and usage==

A fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups. Equal rights are said to empower people with the &quot;ability&quot; to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights activists, as with other social activism, is &quot;Nothing About Us Without Us&quot;.

The social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of:

*Attitudes, for example a more positive attitude towards certain mental traits or behaviors, or not underestimating the potential quality of life of disabled people,
*Social support, for example help dealing with barriers; resources, aids, or positive discrimination to provide equal access, for example providing someone to explain work culture for an autistic employee.
*Information, for example using suitable formats (e.g. braille), levels (e.g. simplicity of language) or coverage (e.g. explaining issues others may take for granted),
*Physical structures, for example buildings with sloped access and elevators, or
*Flexible work hours for people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

=== Limitations and criticisms ===
Oliver did not intend the social model of disability to be an all-encompassing theory of disability, but rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability. This model was conceived of as a tool that could be used to improve the lives of disabled people, rather than a complete explanation for every experience and circumstance. An unintended consequence Oliver foresaw of the adoption of the social model of disability in politics was the undermining of the efforts of disabled people seeking social justice. 

A primary criticism of the social model is its centring of the experiences of individuals with physical impairments, which has resulted in overlooking other forms of disability, such as mental health conditions. 

A secondary criticism relates to how the social model underplays impairments&#x27; impacts. That is, the focus on how the social environment can cause disablement may ignore the fact that impairments &quot;can be restrictive, painful and unpleasant&quot;.

Conversely, some argue against the language of impairment, indicating that some disabilities are purely social and that no impairment exists, such as within the Deaf community. This relates to a critique regarding the belief of a species norm, wherein there is a &quot;normal&quot; human body, and all variations to the norm may be considered &quot;impairments&quot;. Some activists and academic argue that this reliance on a species norm still implies that impairments are deficits, meaning this model is still strongly connected to deficit models of disability. That is, to be considered disabled, an individual must state they have an impairment, which implies, to some degree, that they are damaged. To an extent can have impacts on how government can distribute benefits on ground of impairments that may be more significant and those that are not. Thus, some needs are not met on the basis of not having an impairment significant enough to receive aid, which can be a negative application of the social model within government policy. Newer paradigms, such as Mad studies and neurodiversity studies, recognize a broad spectrum of human experience without a focus on a species norm and thus, deviances from that norm that may be considered impairments or deficits. 

The social model has also been criticized for not promoting the normal differences between disabled people, who can be any age, gender, race, and sexual orientation, and instead presenting them as a monolithic, insufficiently individuated group of people.

Despite these criticisms, academics whose work involves disability indicate that the social model is still beneficial in helping people begin to rethink disability beyond deficit. As Finkelstein states: &quot;A good model can enable us to see something which we do not understand because in the model it can be seen from different viewpoints [...] that can trigger insights that we might not otherwise develop.&quot;

== As an identity ==
In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the social model of disability became a dominant feature of identities for disabled people in the UK. Under the social model of disability, a disability identity is created by &quot;the presence of impairment, the experience of disablism and self- identification as a disabled person.&quot;

The social model of disability implies that attempts to change, &quot;fix&quot;, or &quot;cure&quot; individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the individual, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted &quot;treatments&quot;, while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the Deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it, and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them. Autistic people may say that their &quot;unusual&quot; behavior, which they say can serve an important purpose to them, should not have to be suppressed to please others. They argue instead for acceptance of neurodiversity and accommodation to different needs and goals. Some people diagnosed with a mental disorder argue that they are just different and do not necessarily conform. The biopsychosocial model of disease/disability is an attempt by practitioners to address this.

The label &quot;neurodiversity&quot; has been used by various mental-disability rights advocates within the context of the social model of disability. The label, originally associated with autism, has been applied to other neurodevelopmental conditions or neurodivergences, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental speech disorders, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysnomia, intellectual disability, and Tourette syndrome, as well as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and some mental health conditions such as schizoaffective disorder, antisocial personality disorder, dissociative disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. The social model itself implies that neurodivergent people are living behind barriers that inhibit participation in everyday life. Language associated with warfare such as &quot;battling&quot; or &quot;combatting&quot; is thus replaced with language that de-pathologizes neurodivergence. Advocates for a social model of disability argue instead that neurodivergence should be looked at through the lens of societal or relational models of disability.

The social model implies that practices such as eugenics are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. &quot;Over 200,000 disabled people were some of the earlier victims of the Holocaust, after Communists, other political enemies, and homosexuals.&quot;

A 1986 article stated:

== Economic aspects ==
The social model also relates to economic empowerment, proposing that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. For example, a disabled person may need support services to be able to participate fully in society, and can become disabled if society cuts access to those support services, perhaps in the name of government austerity measures.

The social model addresses other issues, such as the underestimation of the potential of disabled people to contribute to society and add economic value to society if they are given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they outperform competitors.

In Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one-fifth of the working-age population was disabled, equating to an estimated 7.1 million disabled people, compared to an estimated 29.8 million nondisabled people. This analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were not in the labor market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labor market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: &quot;incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Person&#x27;s Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission.&quot;

Canada and the United States have operated under the premise that social assistance benefits should not exceed the amount of money earned through labour in order to give citizens an incentive to search for and maintain employment. This has led to widespread poverty amongst disabled citizens. In the 1950s, disability pensions were established and included various forms of direct economic assistance; however, compensation was low. Since the 1970s, both governments have viewed unemployed, disabled citizens as excess labor due to continuous high unemployment rates and have made minimal attempts to increase employment, keeping disabled people at poverty-level incomes due to the &#x27;incentive&#x27; principle. Poverty is the most debilitating circumstance disabled people face, resulting in the inability to afford proper medical, technological and other assistance necessary to participate in society.

==Law and public policy==
In the United Kingdom, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 defines disability using the medical model – disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions or limitations on their ability to carry out &quot;normal day-to-day activities.&quot; But the requirement of employers and service providers to make &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model. By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable, according to the social model. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality; this was enforced via the formation of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006. In 2010, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 was amalgamated into the Equality Act 2010, along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. The Equality Act 2010 extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a disabled person is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful. Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interviews for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions.

In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability in a wide range of settings. The ADA was the first civil rights law of its kind in the world and affords protections against discrimination to disabled Americans. The law was modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. It requires that mass transportation, commercial buildings, and public accommodations be accessible to disabled people.

In 2007, the European Court of Justice in the &quot;Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA&quot; court case, defined disability narrowly according to a medical definition that excluded temporary illness, when considering the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability. This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.

== Technology ==
Over the last several decades, technology has transformed networks, services, and communication by promoting the rise of telecommunications, computer use, etc. This Digital Revolution has changed how people work, learn, and interact, moving these basic human activities to technological platforms. However, many people who use such technology experience a form of disability. Even if it is not physically visible, those with, for example cognitive impairments, hand tremors, or vision impairments, have some form of disability that prohibit them from fully accessing technology in the way that those without a &quot;technological disability&quot; do.

In &quot;Disability and New Media&quot;, Katie Ellis and Mike Kent state that &quot;technology is often presented as a source of liberation; however, developments associated with Web 2.0 show that this is not always the case&quot;. They go on to state that the technological advancement of Web 2.0 is tethered to social ideology and stigma which &quot;routinely disables people with disability&quot;.

In &quot;Digital Disability: The Social Construction of Disability in New Media&quot;, Gregg Goggin and Christopher Newell call for an innovative understanding of new media and disability issues. They trace developments ranging from telecommunications to assistive technologies to offer a technoscience of disability, which offers a global perspective on how disabled people are represented as users, consumers, viewers, or listeners of new media, by policymakers, corporations, programmers, and disabled people themselves.

== Social construction of disability ==

The social construction of disability comes from a paradigm that suggests that society&#x27;s beliefs about a particular community, group, or population are grounded in the power structures inherent in that society at any given time. The social expectations surrounding concepts, such as disability, thereby enabling a social construct around what society deems disabled and healthy, often based more on observations or value judgements rather than scientific discovery, which can perpetuate biases. 

Ideas surrounding disability stem from societal attitudes, often connected to who is deserving or undeserving, and deemed productive to society at any given time. For example, in the medieval period, a person&#x27;s moral behavior established disability. Disability was a divine punishment or side effect of a moral failing; being physically or biologically different was not enough to be considered disabled. Only during the Age of Enlightenment did society change its definition of disability to be more related to biology. However, what most Western Europeans considered to be healthy determined the new biological definition of health. 

=== 2000 Paralympics ===
While the Olympics were covered live throughout the entire event, the Paralympics were not seen as important enough for the same live coverage before the initial showing. By separating the Olympics and Paralympics, and thus indicating that one is less valuable than the other, disability is socially constructed.

== Applications ==
Applying the social model of disability can change goals and care plans. For example, with the medical model of disability, the goal may be to help a child acquire typical abilities and to reduce impairment. With the social model, the goal may be to have a child be included in the normal life of the community, such as attending birthday parties and other social events, regardless of the level of function. In doing so would create a new norm associated with differently abled people as well as neurodiverse people as well. Allowing for this kind of diversity to be viewed as both valuable and desirable for society. As well, this could include designed spaces and aides that could assist disabled people through the context of universal design, which could help normalize disability through the creation of inclusive spaces. 

=== Education ===

It has been suggested that disability education tries to restore the idea of a moral community, one in which the members question what constitutes a good life, reimagine education, see physical and mental conditions as part of a range of abilities, consider that different talents are distributed in different ways, and understand that all talents should be recognized. In this system, all students would be included in the educational network instead of being set apart as special cases, and it would be acknowledged that all humans have individual needs.

<text>Hugues de Lionne (11 October 1611 – 1 September 1671) was a French statesman.

He was born in Grenoble, of an old family of Dauphiné. Early trained for diplomacy, he fell into disgrace under Cardinal Richelieu, but his remarkable abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Mazarin, who sent him as secretary of the French embassy to the congress of Munster, and, in 1642, on a mission to the pope.

In 1646, he became secretary to the queen regent Anne of Austria. In 1653, he obtained high office in the kings household and in 1654, he was ambassador extraordinary at the election of Pope Alexander VII.

On the death of Ferdinand III, Hugues co-led the French effort to select an Emperor outside the Habsburg family. He and the Cardinal cultivated relationships with German nobility, including Franz Egon of Fürstenberg, prime minister of Cologne, and his brother Wilhelm. With their help, Hugues was instrumental in forming the league of the Rhine, by which Austria was cut off from the Spanish Netherlands, and, as minister of state, was associated with Mazarin in the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), which secured the marriage of Louis XIV to the infanta Maria Theresa of Spain.

At the cardinals dying request he was appointed his successor in foreign affairs, a position he held from 3 April 1663 to 1 September 1671. Among his most important diplomatic successes were the Treaty of Breda (1667), the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) and the Sale of Dunkirk.

He died in Paris in 1671, leaving memoirs. His friend Arnauld de Pomponne replaced him as secretary of State.

He was a man of pleasure, but his natural indolence gave place to an unflagging energy when the occasion demanded it; and, in an age of great ministers, his consummate statesmanship placed him in the front rank.

One of his sons, Artus de Lionne, became a missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and was active in Siam (modern Thailand) and China.

<text>is a Japanese manufacturing company of writing implements. The company was established in 1919 as a manufacturer of dyes and ink. In 1949, the company became a pen manufacturer after they manufactured the world&#x27;s first ball point pen with a chrome ball. This was also Japan&#x27;s first ballpoint pen.

Current products manufactured by Ohto are fountain, rollerball, and gel pens, their refills, and mechanical pencils.

== History ==
The story of Ohto started when Nakata Touzaburo, an employee of the Ministry of Finance, invented a special ink, which he thought would be perfect for use in banknotes. After his idea was rejected by the Ministry, Touzaburo decide to establish a company by himself, establishing &quot;Nakata-Ohka-do&quot; in 1919 as a manufacturer of ink, setting up in Tokyo. 

When the United States Army (that had occupied Japan after the World War II) brought ballpoint pens with them, Japanese people were amazed by them and their long-lasting ink system, since ballpoints did not need to be refilled as often as fountain pens. Nakata took note of this, and in 1949 Nakata-Ohka-do released the first ballpoint pen made in Japan, named &quot;Auto pencil&quot;. It also became the world&#x27;s first pencil-shaped ballpoint pen with chrome ball. To match its own invention, the company also renamed to &quot;Auto&quot;.

In the 1960s, Ohto also released the first water-based ballpoint pen, thus establishing a new category of pens: rollerball pens. In 1974, the company realised that the word &quot;Auto&quot; was too closely associated with cars, and changed its name again to &quot;Ohto&quot;.

<text>Sir William Robert Ferdinand Mount, 3rd Baronet, FRSL (born 2 July 1939), is a British writer, novelist, and columnist for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, as well as a political commentator.

==Life==
Ferdinand Mount, brought up by his parents in the isolated village of Chitterne, Wiltshire, began school at the age of eight. He then attended Greenways and Sunningdale School before Eton College, after which he went to Christ Church, Oxford.

Mount worked at Conservative Party HQ as head of the Number 10 Policy Unit during 1982–83, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and played a significant part in devising the 1983 general election manifesto.

Mount is regarded as being on the one-nation or &quot;wet&quot; side of the Conservative Party. He succeeded his uncle, Sir William Mount, in the family title as 3rd baronet in 1993, but prefers to remain known as Ferdinand Mount.

For eleven years (1991–2002), he was editor of &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and then became a regular contributor to &quot;Standpoint&quot; magazine. He wrote for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and in 2005 joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a commentator. He writes for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

Mount has written novels, including a six-volume novel sequence called &quot;Chronicle of Modern Twilight&quot;, centring on a low-key character, Gus Cotton; the title alludes to the sequence &quot;A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight&quot; by Henry Williamson, and another sequence entitled &quot;Tales of History and Imagination&quot;. Volume 5, entitled &quot;Fairness&quot;, was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2001.

Mount serves as chairman of the Friends of the British Library and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) in 1991.

==Family==

The only son of Robert (Robin) Mount, an army officer and amateur steeplechase jockey, and Lady Julia Pakenham, youngest daughter of the 5th Earl of Longford, KP, Ferdinand inherited the baronetcy from his uncle Lt-Col. Sir William Mount, Bt, TD, DL, who died in 1993, having had three daughters, including Mary Cameron, JP (b. 1934), mother of David Cameron, former Prime Minister (and Conservative Party leader).

The Labour politician Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, and his brother, Edward Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford, were Mount&#x27;s maternal uncles. His maternal aunts were the writers Lady Mary Clive, Lady Pansy Lamb and Lady Violet Powell, the wife of author Anthony Powell.

Sir Ferdinand and his wife, Julia &quot;née&quot; Lucas, live in Islington, London; he and Lady Mount have three surviving children, William (b. 1969 and heir apparent to the title), Harry (b. 1971, a journalist) and Mary (b. 1972, an editor who is married to Indian writer Pankaj Mishra).

<text>Kongens Lyngby (, Danish for &quot;the King&#x27;s Heather Town&quot;; short form Lyngby) is the seat and commercial centre of Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality in the northern suburbs of Copenhagen, Denmark. Lyngby Hovedgade is a busy shopping street and the site of a branch of Magasin du Nord as well as Lyngby Storcenter. The district is also home to several major companies, including COWI A/S, Bang &amp; Olufsen, ICEpower a/s and Microsoft. The Technical University of Denmark relocated to Lyngby from central Copenhagen in the 1970s. Lyngby station is located on the Hillerød radial of Copenhagen&#x27;s S-train network.

==History==

The name Kongens Lyngby is first recorded in 1348. At that time large parts of North Zealand belonged to the Catholic Church (represented by Roskilde Cathedral and the name Lyngby was associated with several places. Store Lyngby belonged to Arresø church. &quot;Our&quot; Lyngby, on the other hand, was crown land. It may therefore have been to distinguish it from these other places that the name emerged.

The original Lyngby village is now known as Bondebyen. Kongens Lyngby was also the site of a watermill, Lyngby Watermill, which is first mentioned in 1492 but is probably several hundred years older.

A royal road, Lyngby Kongevej, was created in 1584 to provide an easy link between Copenhagen and Frederick&#x27;s new Frederiksborg Castle from where it was later extended to Fredensborg and Helsingør. It was the first of a number of royal roads created by Frederick II and his successor Christian IV.

In the 18th century, a growing number of country houses were built in the area by civil servants and merchants from Copenhagen. Kongens Lyngby had no market rights but developed into a local service centre with an increasing number of craftsmen and merchants.

The North Line came to Lyngby in 1863 and was extended to Helsingør in 1864. This enabled citizens from Copenhagen to settle permanently in the area. Several factories opened in the area, including Christian Hasselbalck&#x27;s curtain factory in 1892 which later became the town&#x27;s largest employer.

In the 1930s, Kongens Lyngby developed into a modern suburb. The North Line was converted into an S-train line with more stations and Kongens Lyngby gradually merged with the neighboring settlements.

==Culture==
The Open Air Museum (Frilandsmuseet) is located in Lyngby and is visited by more than 200,000 people each year. The museum includes more than 100 historic buildings that were moved to the area. The Lyngby Culture House (Lyngby Kulturhus) contains several restaurants and cafes, along with a cinema - the Cinema Palace (Kinopalæeet) which opened in 2001. Near to Lyngby station, Templet (The Temple) is a venue which regularly hosts concerts.

<text>The Telegraph &amp; Argus is the daily newspaper for Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It is published six times each week, from Monday to Saturday inclusive. The newspaper has offices in Newhall Way, Bradford, from where its journalists work. Locally, the paper is known as the T&amp;A. It also breaks news 24/7 on its website.

==Overview==
Founded in 1868, the paper was a broadsheet until 1989 when it became tabloid. It features a range of news, features, sport, lifestyle articles, classified advertising and special supplements.

The Telegraph &amp; Argus is owned by Newsquest, the second largest publisher of regional newspapers in the United Kingdom, which is owned by the American media empire Gannett. Perry Austin-Clarke was editor from 1992 to 2017, making him the paper&#x27;s longest-serving editor. As of 2017, the editor was Nigel Burton.

==History==

The &quot;Argus Weekly&quot; occupied Argus Chambers in the Britannia House building over a century ago. The &quot;Yorkshire Evening Argus&quot; and the &quot;Bradford Daily Telegraph&quot; newspapers later combined to form the &quot;Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;, which has occupied its present building, the former Milligan and Forbes Warehouse for some decades. &quot;Bradford&quot; was dropped from the title in the 1930s, when the paper&#x27;s circulation area spread across much of West Yorkshire. At one time it had branch offices in nine towns across the region, as well as an office in Morecambe, the Lancashire coastal resort to which many Bradfordians went to retire. At its height the paper&#x27;s daily sale exceeded 130,000. It is now about one tenth of that figure. Thirty-six years ago a new wing with a skin of dark glass was added to house the printing presses, and these machines can be seen through the windows from the street. However, they are no longer to be seen working, since the newspaper further reduced it economic connection with the city in November 2014 by moving its printing operation to Middlesbrough, in Teesside, while making its Bradford press room staff redundant. Much of the newspaper&#x27;s advertising content is now typeset in India.
There are plans to sell the building itself now that the presses have been sold off piecemeal.

===1936 Abdication Crisis===
On 1 December 1936, it was reporter Ronald Harker from the &quot;Telegraph and Argus&quot; whose report on a speech by Bishop Alfred Blunt of Bradford casting oblique doubt on the piety of King Edward VIII, when referred to the Press Association, sparked the public controversy surrounding the Abdication Crisis. News of Bishop Blunt&#x27;s doubts also provoked contrary opinions, such as those of Darlington clergyman the Rev. Robert Anderson Jardine, who subsequently conducted the wedding service of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Warfield.

<doc id="1117698" wikidata="Q1888667" url="?curid=1117698" title="Manam Motu">
<text>Manam, known locally as Manam Motu, is an island located in the Bismarck Sea across the Stephan Strait from Yawar on the northeast coast of mainland Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Bogia District. The island is wide, and was created by the activity of the Manam Volcano, one of the country’s most active. The island was evacuated in 2004 and its residents resettled elsewhere in Papua New Guinea, but many have begun to return despite concerns of future volcanic activity. Manam is still erupting as of January 2024. 

==Geology==

Manam is a basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano, and despite remarkably symmetrical lower flanks has four distinct valleys, locally known as &quot;avalanche valleys&quot; due to their ability to focus avalanches and particularly pyroclastic flows generated at the summit. These valleys represent the highest-risk areas during eruptions, and, when the island was inhabited, were typically the first areas to be evacuated during heightened activity. The earliest documented eruption of Manam was in 1616.

==History==
The first recorded sighting by Europeans of Manam Island was on 5 August 1545 by the Spanish navigator Iñigo Órtiz de Retes on board the carrack &quot;San Juan&quot;, trying to return from Tidore to New Spain.

==Eruptions and hazards==

Thirteen local residents were killed during an eruption on 3 December 1996, when pyroclastic flows reached the village of Budua.

In November 2004, a major eruption forced the emergency evacuation of over 9,000 inhabitants of the island. The eruption began October 24 but was not seen as a major threat until the wind changed pushing ash and debris towards inhabited areas. Five people died during the eruption. On December 11, the threat was downgraded due to a reduction in activity. There have been significant problems at Bogia on the mainland where the evacuees resettled in camps at Mangem, Asarumba and Potsdam.

In March 2007 the government of Papua New Guinea made a large area of land available for permanent resettlement of displaced islanders at Andarum near Bogia. Also in March 2007, three people were killed by mudslides on the northern part of the island. As of 2014, at least 2000-3000 people have returned to the island despite continued government concerns for their safety.
On March 8, 2022, the volcano erupted, sending a column of ash into the atmosphere. The eruption was confirmed by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Darwin, Australia.

==Residents==
Manam Islanders have their own language called &quot;Manam Pile&quot; (literally &quot;Manam talk&quot;), which is spoken on Manam and the nearby Boisa Islands. Manam islanders have a reputation in Papua New Guinea for musicianship and have produced several locally renowned musicians.

<doc id="1117711" wikidata="Q7073022" url="?curid=1117711" title="OSI protocols">
<text>The Open Systems Interconnection protocols are a family of information exchange standards developed jointly by the ISO and the ITU-T. The standardization process began in 1977. 

While the seven-layer OSI model is often used as a reference for teaching and documentation, the protocols originally conceived for the model did not gain popularity, and only X.400, X.500, and IS-IS have achieved lasting impact. The goal of an open-standard protocol suite instead has been met by the Internet protocol suite, maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

==Overview==
The OSI protocol stack is structured into seven conceptual layers. The layers form a hierarchy of functionality starting with the physical hardware components to the user interfaces at the software application level. Each layer receives information from the layer above, processes it and passes it down to the next layer. Each layer adds encapsulation information (header) to the incoming information before it is passed to the lower layer. Headers generally include address of source and destination, error control information, protocol identification and protocol parameters such as flow control options and sequence numbers.

==Layer 1: physical layer==
This layer deals with the physical plugs, sockets, electrical/optical specifications and the required line codes.

The physical layer includes the medium over which the digital signals are transmitted. It can be twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber, wireless, or other transmission media.

==Layer 2: data link layer==
The data link layer packages raw bits from the physical layer into frames (logical, structured packets for data). It is specified in ITU-T Rec. X.212 [ISO/IEC 8886], ITU-T Rec. X.222 and others. This layer is responsible for transferring frames from one host to another. It might perform error checking. This layer further consists of two sublayers: MAC and LLC.

==Layer 3: network layer==
* Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) – ITU-T Rec. X.213 [ISO/IEC 8348]. SCCP is based on X.213.
* Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) – ITU-T Rec. X.233 [ISO/IEC 8473-1].
* Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS) – ITU-T Rec. X.213 [ISO/IEC 8348].
* Connection-Oriented Network Protocol (X.25) – ITU-T Rec. X.233 [ISO/IEC 8878]. This is the use of the X.25 protocol to provide the CONS.
* Network Fast Byte Protocol – ISO/IEC 14700
* End System to Intermediate System Routing Exchange Protocol (ES-IS) - ISO/IEC 9452 (reprinted in RFC 995).
* Intermediate System to Intermediate System Intra-domain Routing Protocol (IS-IS) - ISO/IEC 10589 (reprinted in RFC 1142), later adapted for the TCP/IP model.
* End System Routing Information Exchange Protocol for use with ISO/IEC 8878 (SNARE) – ITU-T Rec. X.116 [ISO/IEC 10030].

This level is in charge of transferring data between systems in a network, using network-layer addresses of machines to keep track of destinations and sources. This layer uses routers and switches to manage its traffic (control flow control, error check, routing etc.)
So here it takes all routing decisions, it deals with end to end data transmission.

==Layer 4: transport layer==
The connection-mode and connectionless-mode transport services are specified by ITU-T Rec. X.214 [ISO/IEC 8072]; the protocol that provides the connection-mode service is specified by ITU-T Rec. X.224 [ISO/IEC 8073], and the protocol that provides the connectionless-mode service is specified by ITU-T Rec. X.234 [ISO/IEC 8602].
* Transport Protocol Class 0 (TP0)
* Transport Protocol Class 1 (TP1)
* Transport Protocol Class 2 (TP2)
* Transport Protocol Class 3 (TP3)
* Transport Protocol Class 4 (TP4)
* Transport Fast Byte Protocol – ISO 14699

The transport layer transfers data between source and destination processes. Generally, two connection modes are recognized, connection-oriented or connectionless. Connection-oriented service establishes a dedicated virtual circuit and offers various grades of guaranteed delivery, ensuring that data received is identical to data transmitted. Connectionless mode provides only best-effort service without the built-in ability to correct errors, which includes complete loss of data without notifying the data source of the failure. No logical connection, and no persistent state of the transaction exists between the endpoints, lending the connectionless mode low overhead and potentially better real-time performance for timing-critical applications such as voice and video transmissions.

==Layer 5: session layer==
* Session service – ITU-T Rec. X.215 [ISO/IEC 8326]
* Connection-oriented Session protocol – ITU-T Rec. X.225 [ISO/IEC 8327-1]
* Connectionless Session protocol – ITU-T Rec. X.235 [ISO/IEC 9548-1]
The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, and half-duplex or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.

==Layer 6: presentation layer==
* Presentation service – ITU-T Rec. X.216 [ISO/IEC 8822]
* Connection-oriented Presentation protocol – ITU-T Rec. X.226 [ISO/IEC 8823-1]
* Connectionless Presentation protocol – ITU-T Rec. X.236 [ISO/IEC 9576-1]

This layer defines and encrypts/decrypts data types from the application layer. Protocols such as MIDI, MPEG, and GIF are presentation layer formats shared by different applications.

==Layer 7: application layer==
===Common-Application Service Elements (CASEs)===
* Association Control Service Element (ACSE) – ITU-T Rec. X.217 [ISO/IEC 8649], ITU-T Rec. X.227 [ISO/IEC 8650-1], ITU-T Rec. X.237 [ISO/IEC 10035-1].
* Reliable Transfer Service Element (RTSE) – ITU-T Rec. X.218 [ISO/IEC 9066-1], ITU-T Rec. X.228 [ISO/IEC 9066-2].
* Remote Operations Service Element (ROSE) – ITU-T Rec. X.219 [ISO/IEC 9072-1], ITU-T Rec. X.229 [ISO/IEC 9072-2]. TCAP is related to X.219.
* Commitment, Concurrency, and Recovery service element (CCRSE)
* Security Exchange Service Element (SESE)

This keeps track of how each application talks to another application. Destination and source addresses are linked to specific applications.

===Application processes===
* Common management information protocol (CMIP) – ISO 9596 / X.700
* Directory services (DS) – X.500, later modified for the TCP/IP stack as LDAP
* File transfer, access, and management (FTAM)
* Message handling system (MHS) – X.400
* Virtual terminal protocol (VT) - ISO 9040/9041
* Remote Database Access (RDA)
* Distributed Transaction Processing (OSI TP)
* Interlibrary Loan Application Protocol (ILAP)
* Document Transfer And Manipulation (DTAM)
* Document Printing Application (DPA)
* Document Filing and Retrieval (DFR)

==Routing protocols==
* Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) – ISO 10589 (reprinted in RFC 1142)
* End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) – ISO 9542 (reprinted in RFC 995)
* Interdomain Routing Protocol (IDRP) – ISO 10747

<doc id="1117722" wikidata="Q1805432" url="?curid=1117722" title="Language of Temporal Ordering Specification">
<text>In computer science Language of Temporal Ordering Specification (LOTOS) is a formal specification language based on temporal ordering of events. LOTOS is used for communications protocol specification in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI) standards.

LOTOS is an algebraic language that consists of two parts: a part for the description of data and operations, based on abstract data types, and a part for the description of concurrent processes, based on process calculus.

Work on the standard was completed in 1988, and it was published as ISO 8807 in 1989. Between 1993 and 2001, an ISO committee worked to define a revised version of the LOTOS standard, which was published in 2001 as E-LOTOS.

<text>Plaxico Antonio Burress (born August 12, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans, and was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the eighth overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft. He also played for the New York Giants and the New York Jets, and caught the game-winning touchdown in Super Bowl XLII as the Giants beat the then-undefeated New England Patriots.

==Personal life==
Plaxico Burress was born to Vicki Burress in Norfolk, Virginia. He was named after his uncle, has two brothers, and has been married to Tiffany Glenn since July 2005. They have one son, Elijah and a daughter, Giovanna, born November 2009. Burress graduated from Green Run High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 1996 and spent a post-graduate year at Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia. He lives in Totowa, New Jersey.

==College career==
Burress set a Big Ten Conference single-season record by catching 65 passes in his first season at Michigan State, and also excelled on the special-teams coverage units, using his leaping ability as a kick blocker.

He ranks fifth in career touchdown catches (20), and eighth in receiving yards (2,155) in just two seasons at Michigan State University. He was an All-American second-team selection by SportsPage.com and an All-Big Ten Conference first-team pick in 1999. Burress broke the school season-record he set in 1998 (65 catches) with 66 receptions for 1,142 yards (17.3 avg) and 12 touchdowns. He set a Spartans&#x27; single-season-record 12 touchdown receptions, eclipsing the previous record of eight Burress shared (1998) with Andre Rison (1988) and Bob Carey (1949). He forced two fumbles, recovered another, and registered seven tackles (five solos) on special teams.

Burress set a school record with 255 yards receiving on ten catches against the University of Michigan. He ended his career with a school-record 13 receptions for 185 yards and three touchdowns against the University of Florida in the 2000 Citrus Bowl.

He also broke the single-game record of 12 receptions set by tight end Mitch Lyons in 1992. In 1996, he caught 33 passes for 807 yards (24.5 avg.) and 12 touchdowns. Burress was an All-Big Ten Conference first-team selection in 1998 by The Sports Network, and he earned second-team accolades from the league&#x27;s media. He shared Spartan Outstanding Underclass Back Award honors with tailback Sedrick Irvin and wide receiver Gari Scott. Also, he started All Year at split end and set a school season-record with 65 receptions, topping the previous mark of 60 catches by Courtney Hawkins in 1989. He had more than 100 yards receiving in four games and was ranked third in the conference with an average of 84.4 yards per game and fifth in the conference with an average of 5.4 catches per game. He recorded six solo tackles and forced a fumble on special teams.

==Professional career==
===2000 NFL Combine===
===Pittsburgh Steelers===

After being selected in the first round with the eighth overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft, Burress went on to play five years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, amassing 261 receptions for 4,164 yards, 22 touchdowns, and six fumbles over the span of 71 games. Burress was featured on the MTV show &quot;True Life&quot;, documenting his rookie season. His rookie season saw him on the wrong end of one of the NFL&#x27;s most infamous gaffes.

In a game the Steelers eventually won 24–13, Burress caught a 19-yard reception, with his momentum causing him to fall to his knees. The rookie Burress then spiked the ball, believing the play was dead (since that is the rule in the NCAA but not the NFL) but, since he was not touched while he was on the ground, the ball was still live—allowing the Jaguars&#x27; Danny Clark to recover the fumble and run 44 yards with it.

He first broke the 1,000-yard mark in his second season, gaining 1,008 yards on 66 receptions. Burress&#x27;s best season with the Steelers came in 2002, when he set his career highs for receptions (78) and yards (1,325), to go along with seven touchdowns. Burress&#x27;s 1,008-yard season in 2001, combined with Hines Ward&#x27;s 1,003 receiving yards, gave the Steelers their first pair of 1,000-yard receivers. The two would combine to accomplish the same feat in 2002.

In 2002, Burress appeared in all 16 regular season games and caught a career high 78 passes. On November 10, 2002, Burress took advantage of an extra 15 minutes of play to set a Steelers&#x27; franchise record with 253 receiving yards in a 34–34 tie against the Atlanta Falcons. He caught nine passes and scored two touchdowns in the game, and nearly won it but was stopped at the 1-yard line as time expired. Also in 2002, Burress played in his first career playoff game, accumulating six receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown. He finished the season with another career high 1,325 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.

He finished 2003 catching 60 passes for 860 yards and four touchdowns as the Steelers went 6-10 and missed the playoffs. In 2004, Burress caught 35 passes on 60 targets for 698 yards and 5 touchdowns through the regular season. He got his first career playoff win when the Steelers defeated the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional playoff game 20-17. During the game, he caught two passes on seven targets for 28 yards. He scored a touchdown in his first and only AFC Championship appearance on a seven yard pass from Ben Roethlisberger as the Steelers ended their season losing to eventual Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots.

===New York Giants===

On January 23, 2005, after a playoff defeat, Burress announced his intentions to leave the Steelers. On March 17, he signed a six-year, $25 million contract with the New York Giants.

In his first season with the Giants, Burress caught 76 passes for 1,214 yards, helping the team earn an 11–5 record and first place in the NFC East as well as the NFC&#x27;s fourth seed. However, they were shut out 23–0 by the Carolina Panthers in the opening round of the 2005–06 NFL playoffs.

In the 2006 season, Burress managed a career-high ten touchdowns but fell short of the 1,000-yard mark, appearing in only 15 games and struggling with a groin injury for much of the year. The Giants lost six of their last eight games and fell in the NFC Wild Card playoffs to the NFC East champion Philadelphia Eagles 23–20. Burress had a touchdown catch on the opening drive and finished the game with five receptions for 89 yards and two touchdowns.

In 2007, Burress was the Giants&#x27; top receiver with 70 receptions for 1,025 yards, despite not practicing all season because of his ailing ankle. He also set a franchise playoff record in the NFC title game in Green Bay with 11 receptions for 154 yards as the Giants advanced to Super Bowl XLII.

In Super Bowl XLII, Burress caught the game-winning touchdown pass that made the score 17–14 in the Giants&#x27; favor over the undefeated (18–0) New England Patriots. He gained a measure of &quot;Super Bowl legend&quot; by predicting the Patriots would lose by the score 23–17.

Before their May mini-camp, Burress and his teammates were invited by then-President George W. Bush to the White House on April 30, 2008, to honor their victory in Super Bowl XLII.

Just before the start of the Giants&#x27; mandatory May mini-camp, Burress had said that he would not participate in the camp because he was upset with his contract. He attended the camp to avoid paying a fine but refused to practice with the team. Although he was slated to receive $3.25 million for 2008, Burress felt underpaid compared to other star receivers. After indicating that he might hold out training camp as well, he joined, but practiced very little, claiming his ankle was injured.

In September 2008, Burress did not show up for work on a Monday and could not be reached by phone for two days. On September 24, 2008, the team announced that Burress would be suspended for the game on October 5 for a violation of team rules.

This was not the first time that Burress had been temporarily suspended by an NFL team—in May 2004, he was suspended by the Pittsburgh Steelers for failing to show up for a Monday team practice. On October 24 he was issued four fines totaling $60,000 for the following reasons:

# $20,000 for post-game comments regarding officiating—specifically, inappropriate comments on officiating.
# $20,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct—specifically, verbal abuse of the head linesman.
# $5,000 for throwing the ball in the stands.
# $15,000 for slapping a referee in the face.
Burress signed a five-year, $35 million contract extension prior to the season. However, it was an incentive-laced deal, with $11.5 million in non-guaranteed base salaries in the contract, non-guaranteed roster bonuses of $3.5 million, non-guaranteed escalators of $5 million based on performance and $1.3 million in non-guaranteed workout bonuses among other things. According to various reports, the Giants would be able to cut or trade Burress after the season and get $23 million taken off their books.

On November 2, in the second quarter of the Giants&#x27; ninth regular-season game against the Dallas Cowboys, Burress caught his 500th career reception. On November 23, 2008, Burress started the game against the Arizona Cardinals in Arizona after being considered questionable with a hamstring injury. The first play of the game he had a 4-yard reception but it was called back on a penalty. Burress left the game and did not return in what would be his final appearance with the Giants.

Burress was released by the Giants on April 3, 2009, when it was apparent his accidental shooting court case would take longer than expected to resolve.

===New York Jets===

Burress agreed to a one-year contract worth approximately $3.017 million guaranteed with the New York Jets on July 31, 2011, after turning down a two-year deal from the Pittsburgh Steelers that was rumored to be valued at a little more than the Jets offer but without as much guaranteed money. In his first game back in New York at MetLife Stadium in a pre-season matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, Burress caught a pass from Mark Sanchez on the first play of the Jets&#x27; first drive, and in the second quarter caught a touchdown pass. On October 23, 2011, in a game against the San Diego Chargers Burress caught three touchdown passes from Sanchez, tying a game career high.

===Second stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers===
Burress re-signed with the Steelers on November 20, 2012, after injuries sustained by Jerricho Cotchery and Antonio Brown. On December 30, 2012, Burress caught a 12-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Burress had not caught a touchdown from Roethlisberger since 2004. On March 12, 2013, Burress signed a one-year deal to stay with the Steelers. He suffered a torn rotator cuff during a practice on August 8; on August 13, Burress was placed on the injured reserve list by the Steelers.

==NFL career statistics==

===Regular season===
=== Postseason ===

==Coaching career==
===Arizona Cardinals===
On July 22, 2017, Burress was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as a coaching intern.

==Legal troubles==
In August and September 2008, Totowa police responded to two domestic disturbance calls at the Burress residence. At both times temporary restraining orders were issued that were later dismissed by the New Jersey state court.

===Accidental shooting===
On November 28, 2008, Burress suffered an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound to his right thigh at the nightclub LQ on Lexington Avenue in New York City when his Glock pistol in the pocket of his jeans began sliding down his leg; apparently in reaching for his gun, he inadvertently pulled the trigger, causing the gun to fire. The injury was not life-threatening and Burress was released from an area hospital the next afternoon. Two days later, Burress turned himself in to police to face charges of criminal possession of a handgun. It was later discovered that New York City police only learned about the incident after seeing it on television and were not called by NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital as required by law. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the hospital actions an &quot;outrage&quot; and stated that they are a &quot;chargeable offense&quot;. Bloomberg also urged that Burress be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, saying that any punishment short of the minimum years for unlawful carrying of a handgun would be &quot;a mockery of the law.&quot; Burress had an expired concealed carry license from Florida, but no New York license.

On December 2, 2008, Burress posted bail of $100,000. Later in the day, Burress reported to Giants Stadium as per team policy for injured but active players and was told he would be suspended without pay for the remaining four games of the 2008 regular season for conduct detrimental to the team. In addition, the Giants placed Burress on their reserve/non-football injury list, meaning he was ineligible to return for the playoffs. Burress was also scheduled to receive $1 million from his signing bonus on December 10, 2008, initially withheld by the team. The NFL Players Association filed a grievance, saying the team violated the collective bargaining agreement and challenging the suspension and fine received by Burress. A Special Master in arbitration subsequently ruled that the Giants must deliver the entire $1 million to Burress, as per the collective bargaining agreement. &quot;To think that a player could carry a loaded gun into a nightclub, shoot himself and miss the rest of the season but get to keep his entire signing bonus illustrates one of the serious flaws in the current system,&quot; said Giants co-owner John Mara in a statement afterward.

On December 23, 2008, a search of Burress&#x27;s New Jersey home by the Totowa, New Jersey police, the New York Police Department, and investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney turned up a 9 mm handgun, a rifle, ammunition, and the clothing believed to have been worn by Burress on the night of his shooting. On June 12, 2009, Burress&#x27;s attorney Benjamin Brafman announced that he had been unable to reach a sentencing agreement.

Burress asked a Manhattan grand jury for sympathy during two hours of testimony on July 29, 2009. On Monday, August 3, 2009, prosecutors announced that Burress had been indicted by the grand jury on two felony counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, and a single count of reckless endangerment in the second degree, a misdemeanor.

On August 20, 2009, Burress accepted a plea deal that would put him in prison for two years with an additional two years of supervised release. His sentencing was held on September 22, 2009. Burress hired a prison consultant to advise him on what to expect while in prison. In January 2010, Burress applied for and was denied a work release from prison. On June 6, 2011, Burress was released from a protective custody unit of the Oneida Correctional Facility in Rome, New York, having served 20 months.

===Civil lawsuits===
Burress had a civil lawsuit, filed on December 8, 2008, in Broward County, Florida, in which Alise Smith claimed that Burress&#x27;s $140,000 Mercedes-Benz collided with the back of her car. The suit claimed that Burress was liable for causing permanent injuries to Smith. Burress&#x27;s car insurance policy had been cancelled three days before the accident due to nonpayment of the premium. In 2012, he was ordered to pay Smith $159,000, which he eventually did by May 2013 after a judge had ordered the sale of his mansion in Virginia Beach.

In January 2010, Burress was the defendant in a civil lawsuit brought against him by a Lebanon County, Pennsylvania car dealer, who claimed that Burress was given a leased Chevrolet Avalanche in return for promises to appear at publicity events for the dealership. The dealer claimed that Burress never returned the car and never attended any publicity events; the damaged car was eventually returned after being impounded by the New York Police Department. Burress acknowledged that he was responsible for some of the damage to the car, but asked a jury to determine the amount. On January 15, 2009, the jury returned a verdict awarding only $1,700 to the dealer, who had asked for damages of up to $19,000. According to the Associated Press, Burress has been sued at least nine times since he joined the NFL in 2000.

===Tax indictment===
On April 30, 2015, Burress was indicted by the State of New Jersey on charges that he failed to pay nearly $48,000 in income taxes. Burress filed his 2013 state income tax return on October 20, 2014, for which he submitted an electronic transfer. According to the State Division of Taxation, the transfer failed to go through. Burress was notified multiple times in an attempt to collect the tax debt, including via certified mail, but never responded. The indictment made him the first person in New Jersey to be charged under a new state law which treats bad electronic money transfers as a criminal offense, equivalent to writing bad checks.

On December 7, 2015, Burress entered into a plea agreement in a hearing at Mercer County Superior Court, admitting guilt in failure to pay $46,000 in taxes on his 2013 tax return (a year in which he earned $1 million in income.) Burress faced up to 5 years&#x27; probation at his February 5, 2016 sentencing hearing. He received a conditional 364-day jail sentence, was placed on probation for five years, and ordered to repay $56,000 in penalties and restitution to the state by Judge Pedro Jimenez in Mercer County Superior Court. He will not go to jail if he follows his conditions of probation. Although he avoided prison time by pleading guilty, failure to pay the amount in full by the conclusion of his probation could result in Burress&#x27;s incarceration.

==Other ventures==
Burress, co-wrote the book &quot;Giant: The Road to the Super Bowl&quot; (), published July 1, 2008 by It Books, about his Super Bowl experience.

Burress appeared on &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; on July 29, 2014. Burress joined SportsNet, New York&#x27;s SportsNite, making his debut as an NFL analyst on Sunday September 7, 2014.

<text>The first USS &quot;Cowell&quot; (DD–167) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Brighton, and later to the [[Soviet Navy]] as Zharky&quot;.

==As USS &quot;Cowell&quot;==

Named for John G. Cowell, she was launched on 23 November 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss E. P. Garney; and commissioned on 17 March 1919.

&quot;Cowell&quot; cleared Boston, Massachusetts, 3 May 1919, to take station at Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, first stopping point for the Navy seaplanes which that month began the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After patrolling her station, she returned to Boston 22 May to prepare for European service, and on 30 June sailed from New York to join the American naval force in the Adriatic. Here she served as dispatch ship for the Allied Peace Commission, and as station ship at Croatian (then in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ports of Rijeka, Split, and Trogir, in turn until 23 October, in support of the allied occupation of the eastern Adriatic, when she cleared for home.

In reserve at Boston and Charleston from 1 December 1919, &quot;Cowell&quot; put to sea for a training period out of Newport, Rhode Island, with a reserve organization from April through October 1921, returning to Charleston. On 27 June 1922, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she lay until recommissioned 17 June 1940 for patrol duty in the Atlantic. She cruised along the United States East Coast on this duty until 18 September 1940 when she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, there to be decommissioned 23 September 1940 and transferred to the Royal Navy the same day in the land bases for destroyers exchange.

==As HMS &quot;Brighton&quot;==

Commissioned as HMS &quot;Brighton&quot;, the destroyer served with minelayers in the Denmark Strait and off the Faroe Islands. On 27 February 1941, she rescued from the sea 19 survivors of torpedoed SS &quot;Baltisan&quot;. &quot;Brighton&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog. After refit, she served during 1943 and 1944 as target ship for naval aircraft training in the Western Approaches and at Rosyth, Scotland.

==As &quot;Zharky&quot;==

On 16 July 1944 she was transferred to Russia, in whose Navy she served as &quot;Zharky&quot; (rus. Жаркий, &quot;Torrid&quot;) until returned to the British at Rosyth 28 February 1949. She was sold for scrap on 5 April 1949.

<text>ZMODEM is an inline file transfer protocol developed by Chuck Forsberg in 1986, in a project funded by Telenet in order to improve file transfers on their X.25 network. In addition to dramatically improved performance compared to older protocols, ZMODEM offered restartable transfers, auto-start by the sender, an expanded 32-bit CRC, and control character quoting supporting 8-bit clean transfers, allowing it to be used on networks that would not pass control characters.

In contrast to most transfer protocols developed for bulletin board systems (BBSs), ZMODEM was not directly based on, nor compatible with, the seminal XMODEM. Many variants of XMODEM had been developed in order to address one or more of its shortcomings, and most remained backward compatible and would successfully complete transfers with &quot;classic&quot; XMODEM implementations. This list includes Forsberg&#x27;s own YMODEM.

ZMODEM eschewed backward compatibility in favor of producing a radically improved protocol. It performed at least as well as any of the high-performance varieties of XMODEM, did so over links that previously did not work at all, like X.25, or had poor performance, like Telebit modems, and included useful features found in few other protocols. ZMODEM became extremely popular on bulletin board systems (BBS) in the early 1990s, becoming a standard as widespread as XMODEM had been before it.

==Improvements==
===Streaming===
Generally, file transfer protocols break down a file into a series of &quot;packets&quot;, and then send them one-at-a-time to the receiver. The main portion of the packet, the &quot;payload&quot;, is a certain number of bytes from the file being sent. After the payload comes a &quot;checksum&quot; or &quot;cyclic redundancy check&quot; (CRC) that can be used to determine if the payload was received correctly. If the packet is received correctly, the receiver sends an message and the sender then starts sending the next packet.

The telephone system introduces a small delay known as &quot;latency&quot; that interferes with this process. Even if the receiver sends the immediately, the delay in the phone lines means there will always be some time before the sender receives it and sends the next packet. As modem speeds increase, this delay represents a larger and larger number of packets that could have been sent during the delay, decreasing the &quot;channel efficiency&quot;.

XMODEM used 128-byte payloads with a three-byte header and one-byte checksum for a total of 132 bytes per packet. In the era of 300 bit/s modems, a packet took about four seconds to send, and typical latencies were on the order of of a second, so the performance overhead was not significant. As speeds increase the problem becomes more problematic; at 2400 bit/s a packet takes about 0.55 seconds to send, so about of the available bandwidth is wasted waiting for s. At 9600 bit/s a packet requires only 0.13 seconds to send, so about of the bandwidth is wasted.

One solution to this problem is the use of a sliding window. These protocols address latency by allowing the sender to continue sending a number of packets without waiting for an . The number of packets that it allows to continue is the &quot;window&quot;, which was typically between two and sixteen packets in most implementations. A number of new versions of XMODEM with sliding window support appeared in the early 1980s.

Sliding windows are useful for latencies on the order of several packet lengths, which is the case for XMODEM on conventional phone lines. However, it is not enough to address longer latencies found on overseas phone calls, satellite connections, or X.25 services such as PC Pursuit, where the latencies are on the order of a second or longer. In other cases, where the reverse channel was much slower than the sending one, as was the case for Telebit or US Robotics modems, even the small number of s might overwhelm the return channel and cause the transfer to pause.

ZMODEM addressed these problems by removing the need for s at all, allowing the sender to send data continually as long as the receiver detected no errors. Only s had to be sent, if and only if there was a problem. Since ZMODEM was often used on links with built-in error correction, like X.25, the receiver would often not send a single message back to the sender. As a result, the system would send the entire file in a continual stream, and ZMODEM referred to itself as a &quot;streaming protocol&quot;.

ZMODEM&#x27;s performance was so improved over previous common protocols that it generally replaced even special protocols such as YMODEM-g, which included no error correction at all and instead relied on error-free links maintained by the modems. Although YMODEM-g was faster (and thus popular among &quot;power users&quot;), the lack of other features such as restartable transfers made it less appealing.

===Restart===
XMODEM, and most protocols based on it, managed packet order by prefixing the data with a packet number from 1 to 255. Windowed versions used this packet number to indicate which packets had been received properly, or specify one that had not. Since the packets were 128 bytes long, this meant the maximum amount of data that could be transferred before the packet numbers rolled over was 32 KB.

ZMODEM replaced the packet number with the actual location in the file, indicated by a 32-bit number. This allowed it to send messages that re-wound the transfer to the point of failure, regardless of how long the file might be. This same feature was also used to re-start transfers if they failed or were deliberately interrupted. In this case, the receiver would look to see how much data had been previously received and then send a with that location, automatically triggering the sender to start from that point.

===Auto-start===
Auto-starting simplified management by allowing the sending machine to start the transfer. Previously the user had to first request the file from the sender, placing it into a &quot;waiting&quot; state, then return to their local program and invoke a command to start the transfer. With auto-transfer, they simply requested the file, the sender would then automatically trigger the transfer in the user&#x27;s program.

==Variations==
A number of modified versions of ZMODEM appeared. ZedZap was a variant of ZMODEM with 8 KB blocks for better performance on high-speed modems. LeechZmodem was a mischievous ZMODEM variant (among similar XMODEM and YMODEM derivatives) that cheated BBS download quotas. A backwards-compatible extension of ZMODEM with 32 KB and 64 KB block lengths was created by ADONTEC in 2002 and 2007 to increase performance on high-speed error free connections like ISDN or TCP/IP networks.

The most notable ZMODEM implementations were from Chuck Forsberg&#x27;s Omen Technology, Inc. These included DSZ (DOS Send ZMODEM), GSZ (Graphical Send ZMODEM), and the ubiquitous (l)rzsz for Unix variants.

In more current times, the developers of Synchronet have created a modern X/Y/ZMODEM implementation named SEXYZ, loosely based on the zmtx/zmrx package, which runs natively on Windows and Unix variants, supports long filenames and faster, more reliable data transfers. The ZMODEM implementation from SEXYZ has also been incorporated into the SyncTERM project. Synchronet, SEXYZ, and SyncTERM are all open-source, cross-platform, BBS-centric projects.

Forsberg himself collected a number of improvements into ZMODEM-90. The first of these is MobyTurbo, which removed control quoting to further improve performance, about 15%. Even on networks that &quot;eat&quot; control characters, ZMODEM-90 can be tailored to quote only those characters the network actually eats, as opposed to every possible one. A similar improvement allows ZMODEM-90 to work on 7-bit networks, whereas earlier protocols (with the notable exception of Kermit) had all demanded 8-bits to one degree or another. Finally, ZMODEM-90 includes a basic run-length encoding compression system to further improve performance on uncompressed files.

==Limitations==
* Some of the ZMODEM packets (e.g. ZACK, ZRPOS) embed a byte-offset within the transferred file as a 32-bit unsigned integer. This design limits the feasibility of ZMODEM to only reliably transfer files that are under 4GB in size.
* Even though the protocol could permit it, the reference (l)rzsz implementation cannot encode arbitrary non-control characters (e.g. &#x27;~&#x27;) which are often used by TCP/IP connection programs like telnet and ssh as client-side &quot;terminal escape&quot; characters. Users must disable the terminal escape feature to achieve reliable transfers over these kinds of links, e.g. ssh -e none user@hostname.

<text>XMODEM is a simple file transfer protocol developed as a quick hack by Ward Christensen for use in his 1977 MODEM.ASM terminal program. It allowed users to transmit files between their computers when both sides used MODEM. Keith Petersen made a minor update to always turn on &quot;quiet mode&quot;, and called the result XMODEM.

XMODEM, like most file transfer protocols, breaks up the original data into a series of &quot;packets&quot; that are sent to the receiver, along with additional information allowing the receiver to determine whether that packet was correctly received. If an error is detected, the receiver requests that the packet be re-sent. A string of bad packets causes the transfer to abort.

XMODEM became extremely popular in the early bulletin board system (BBS) market, largely because it was simple to implement. It was also fairly inefficient, and as modem speeds increased, this problem led to the development of a number of modified versions of XMODEM to improve performance or address other problems with the protocol. Christensen believed his original XMODEM to be &quot;the single most modified program in computing history&quot;.

Chuck Forsberg collected a number of common modifications into his YMODEM protocol, but poor implementation led to a further fracturing before they were re-unified by his later ZMODEM protocol. ZMODEM became very popular, but never completely replaced XMODEM in the BBS market.

==Packet structure==

The original XMODEM used a 128-byte data packet, the block size used on CP/M floppy disks. The packet was prefixed by a simple 3-byte header containing a &lt;SOH&gt; character, a &quot;block number&quot; from 1-255, and the &quot;inverse&quot; block number—255 minus the block number. Block numbering starts with 1 for the first block sent, not 0. The header was followed by the 128 bytes of data, and then a single-byte checksum. The checksum was the sum of all 128 data bytes in the packet modulo 256. The complete packet was thus 132 bytes long, containing 128 bytes of payload data, for a total channel efficiency of about 97%.

The file was marked &quot;complete&quot; with a &lt;EOT&gt; character sent after the last block. This character was not in a packet, but sent alone as a single byte. Since the file length was not sent as part of the protocol, the last packet was padded out with a &quot;known character&quot; that could be dropped. In the original specification, this defaulted to or 26 decimal, which CP/M used as the end-of-file marker inside its own disk format. The standard suggested any character could be used for padding, but there was no way for it to be changed &quot;within the protocol&quot; itself – if an implementation changed the padding character, only clients using the same implementation would correctly interpret the new padding character.

==Transfer details==

Files were transferred one packet at a time. When received, the packet&#x27;s checksum was calculated by the receiver and compared to the one received from the sender at the end of the packet. If the two matched, the receiver sent an &lt;ACK&gt; message back to the sender, which then sent the next packet in sequence. If there was a problem with the checksum, the receiver instead sent a &lt;NAK&gt;. If a &lt;NAK&gt; was received, the sender would re-send the packet, and continued to try several times, normally ten, before aborting the transfer.

A &lt;NAK&gt; was also sent if the receiver did not receive a valid packet within ten seconds while still expecting data due to the lack of a &lt;EOT&gt; character. A seven-second timeout was also used &quot;within&quot; a packet, guarding against dropped connections in mid-packet.

The block numbers were also examined in a simple way to check for errors. After receiving a packet successfully, the next packet should have a one-higher number. If it instead received the same block number this was not considered serious, it was implied that the &lt;ACK&gt; had not been received by the sender, which had then re-sent the packet. Any other packet number signalled that packets had been lost.

Transfers were receiver-driven; the transmitter would not send any data until an initial &lt;NAK&gt; was sent by the receiver. This was a logical outcome of the way the user interacted with the sending machine, which would be remotely located. The user would navigate to the requested file on the sending machine, and then ask that machine to transfer it. Once this command was issued, the user would then execute a command in their local software to start receiving. Since the delay between asking the remote system for the file and issuing a local command to receive was unknown, XMODEM allowed up to 90 seconds for the receiver to begin issuing requests for data packets.

==Problems==
Although XMODEM was robust enough for a journalist in 1982 to transmit stories from Pakistan to the United States with an Osborne 1 and acoustic coupler over poor-quality telephone lines, the protocol had several flaws.

===Minor problems===

XMODEM was written for CP/M machines, and bears several marks of that operating system. Notably, files on CP/M were always multiples of 128 bytes, and their end was marked within a block with the &lt;EOT&gt; character. These characteristics were transplanted directly into XMODEM. However, other operating systems did not feature either of these peculiarities, and the widespread introduction of MS-DOS in the early 1980s led to XMODEM having to be updated to notice either a &lt;EOT&gt; &quot;or&quot; &lt;EOF&gt; as the end-of-file marker.

For some time it was suggested that sending a &lt;CAN&gt; character instead of an &lt;ACK&gt; or &lt;NAK&gt; should be supported in order to easily abort the transfer from the receiving end. Likewise, a &lt;CAN&gt; received in place of the &lt;SOH&gt; indicated the sender wished to cancel the transfer. However, this character could be easily &quot;created&quot; via simple noise-related errors of what was meant to be an &lt;ACK&gt; or &lt;NAK&gt;. A double-&lt;CAN&gt; was proposed to avoid this problem, but it is not clear if this was widely implemented.

===Major problems===

XMODEM was designed for simplicity, without much knowledge of other file transfer protocols – which were fairly rare anyway. Due to its simplicity, there were a number of very basic errors that could cause a transfer to fail, or worse, result in an incorrect file which went unnoticed by the protocol. Most of this was due to the use of a simple checksum for error correction, which is susceptible to missing errors in the data if &quot;two&quot; bits are reversed, which can happen with a suitably short burst of noise. Additionally, similar damage to the header or checksum could lead to a failed transfer in cases where the data itself was undamaged.

Many authors introduced extensions to XMODEM to address these and other problems. Many asked for these extensions to be included as part of a new XMODEM standard. However, Ward Christensen refused to do this, as it was precisely the &quot;lack&quot; of these features, and the associated coding needed to support them, which led to XMODEM&#x27;s widespread use. As he explained:

:It was a quick hack I threw together, very unplanned (like everything I do), to satisfy a personal need to communicate with some other people. ONLY the fact that it was done in 8/77, and that I put it in the public domain immediately, made it become the standard that it is...
:...People who suggest I make SIGNIFICANT changes to the protocol, such as &#x27;full duplex&#x27;, &#x27;multiple outstanding blocks&#x27;, &#x27;multiple destinations&#x27;, etc etc don&#x27;t understand that the incredible simplicity of the protocol is one of the reasons it survived.

==Batch transfers==
Another problem with XMODEM was that it required the transfer to be user-driven rather than automated. Typically this meant the user would navigate on the sender&#x27;s system to select the file they wanted, and then use a command to put that system into the &quot;ready to send&quot; mode. They would then trigger the transfer from their end using a command in their terminal emulator. If the user wanted to transfer another file, they would have to repeat this process again.

For automated transfers between two sites, a number of add-ons to the XMODEM protocol were implemented over time. These generally assumed the sender would continue sending file after file, with the receiver attempting to trigger the next file by sending a codice_1 as normal at the start of a transfer. When the codice_1s timed out, it could be assumed that either there were no more files, or the link was broken anyway.

===MODEM7===
MODEM7, also known as MODEM7 batch or Batch XMODEM, was the first known extension of the XMODEM protocol. A normal XMODEM file transfer starts with the receiver sending a single codice_1 character to the sender, which then starts sending a single codice_4 to indicate the start of the data, and then packets of data.

MODEM7 changed this behavior only slightly, by sending the filename, in 8.3 filename format, before the &lt;SOH&gt;. Each character was sent individually and had to be echoed by the receiver as a form of error correction. For a non-aware XMODEM implementation, this data would simply be ignored while it waited for the codice_4 to arrive, so the characters would not be echoed and the implementation could fall back to conventional XMODEM. With &quot;aware&quot; software, the file name could be used to save the file locally. Transfers could continue with another codice_6, each file is saved under the name being sent to the receiver.

Jerry Pournelle in 1983 described MODEM7 as &quot;probably the most popular microcomputer communications program in existence&quot;.

===TeLink===
MODEM7 sent the filename as normal text, which meant it could be corrupted by the same problems that XMODEM was attempting to avoid. This led to the introduction of TeLink by Tom Jennings, author of the original FidoNet mailers.

TeLink avoided MODEM7&#x27;s problems by standardizing a new &quot;zero packet&quot; containing information about the original file. This included the file&#x27;s name, size, and timestamp, which were placed in a regular 128 byte XMODEM block. Whereas a normal XMODEM transfer would start with the sender sending &quot;block 1&quot; with a codice_7 header, the TeLink header packet was labeled &quot;block 0&quot; and began with a codice_8. The packet contained the file creation date and time, filename up to 16 characters, the file size as a 4-byte value, and the name of the program sending the file.

A normal XMODEM implementation would simply discard the packet, the assumption being that the packet number had been corrupted. But this led to a potential time delay if the packet were discarded, as the sender could not tell whether the receiver had responded with a codice_6 because it did not understand the zero packet or because there was a transmission error. As TeLink was normally used only by FidoNet software, which demanded it as part of the FidoNet standards, this did not present a real-world problem as both ends would always support this standard.

The basic &quot;block 0&quot; system became a standard in the FidoNet community, and was re-used by a number of future protocols like SEAlink and YMODEM.

==XMODEM-CRC==
The checksum used in the original protocol was extremely simple, and errors within the packet could go unnoticed. This led to the introduction of XMODEM-CRC by John Byrns, which used a 16-bit CRC in place of the 8-bit checksum. CRCs encode not only the data in the packet, but its location as well, allowing it to notice the bit-replacement errors that a checksum would miss. Statistically, this made the chance of detecting an error less than 16 bits long 99.9969%, and even higher for longer error bit strings.

XMODEM-CRC was designed to be backwardly compatible with XMODEM. To do this, the receiver sent a C (capital C) character instead of a &lt;NAK&gt; to start the transfer. If the sender responded by sending a packet, it was assumed the sender &quot;knew&quot; XMODEM-CRC, and the receiver continued sending C&#x27;s. If no packet was forthcoming, the receiver assumed the sender did not know the protocol, and sent an &lt;NAK&gt; to start a &quot;traditional&quot; XMODEM transfer.

Unfortunately, this attempt at backward compatibility had a downside. Since it was possible that the initial C character would be lost or corrupted, it could not be assumed that the receiver did not support XMODEM-CRC if the first attempt to trigger the transfer failed. The receiver thus tried to start the transfer three times with C, waiting three seconds between each attempt. This meant that if the user selected XMODEM-CRC while attempting to talk to &quot;any&quot; XMODEM, as it was intended, there was a potential 10 second delay before the transfer started.

To avoid the delay, the sender and receiver would generally list XMODEM-CRC separately from XMODEM, allowing the user to select &quot;basic&quot; XMODEM if the sender didn&#x27;t explicitly list it. To the average user, XMODEM-CRC was essentially a &quot;second protocol&quot;, and treated as such. This was not true of FidoNet mailers, however, where CRC was defined as the standard for all TeLink transfers.

==Higher throughput==
Since the XMODEM protocol required the sender to stop and wait for an &lt;ACK&gt; or &lt;NAK&gt; message from the receiver, it tended to be quite slow. In the era of 300 bit/s modems, the entire 132-byte packet required 4.4 seconds to send (132 bytes * (8 bits per byte + 1 start bit + 1 stop bit) / 300 bits per second). Assuming it takes 0.2 seconds for the receiver&#x27;s &lt;ACK&gt; to make it back to the sender and the next packet to start hitting the receiver (0.1 seconds in both directions), the overall time for one packet would be 4.6 seconds, just over 92% channel efficiency.

The time for the &lt;ACK&gt;/&lt;NAK&gt; process was a fixed function of the underlying communications network, not of the performance of the modems. As modem speeds increased, the fixed delay grew in proportion to time needed to send the packet. For instance, at 2400 bit/s the packets took only 0.55 seconds to send, so if the &lt;ACK&gt;/&lt;NAK&gt; still took 0.2 seconds to make it back to the user&#x27;s machine, the efficiency has fallen to 71%. At 9600 bit/s it is just under 40% – more time is spent waiting for the reply than is needed to send the packet.

A number of new versions of XMODEM were introduced in order to address these problems. Like earlier extensions, these versions tended to be backward-compatible with the original XMODEM, and like those extensions, this led to further fracturing of the XMODEM landscape in the user&#x27;s terminal emulator. In the end, dozens of versions of XMODEM emerged.

===WXModem===
WXmodem, short for &quot;Windowed Xmodem&quot;, is a variant of XMODEM developed by Peter Boswell in 1986 for use on high-latency lines, specifically public X.25 systems and PC Pursuit. These have latencies that are far higher than the plain-old telephone service, which leads to very poor efficiency in XMODEM. Additionally, these networks often use control characters for flow control and other tasks, notably XON/XOFF will stop the data flow. Finally, in the case of an error that required a resend, it was sometimes difficult to know whether a codice_4 was a packet indicator or more noise. WXmodem adapted XMODEM-CRC to address these problems.

One change was to escape a small set of control characters: codice_11, codice_12, codice_13 and codice_14. These were escaped by inserting a codice_11 in front of them, and then modifying the character by XORing it with 64. In theory, this meant the packet might be as long as 264 bytes if it originally consisted entirely of characters that required escaping. These inserted and modified characters are not part of the CRC calculation, they are removed and converted at the receiving end before calculating the CRC.

Additionally, all packets were prefixed with a codice_14 character, which meant the packet lead-in was codice_14codice_4, reducing the chance that a stray codice_4 would be confused for a packet header in various error cases. An unescaped codice_14 found in the body of a packet was an error.

The major change in WXMODEM is the use of a sliding window to improve throughput on high-latency links. To do so, the codice_21 messages were followed by the packet number they were codice_21ing or codice_1ing. The receiver does not have to codice_21 every packet; it is allowed to codice_21 any number between one and four packets. An codice_21 with the fourth packet sequence number is assumed to codice_21 all four packets. An error causes a codice_1 to be sent immediately, with all packets from that number and after being re-sent.

Requiring an codice_21 every four packets makes the system work like it has a packet size of 512 bytes, but in the case of an error, typically only requires 128 bytes to be re-sent. Moreover, it reduces the amount of data flowing in the reverse direction by four times. This is of little interest in the typical modem&#x27;s full duplex operation, but is important in half duplex systems like Telebit models which have 19 kB speed in one direction and 75 bits/s in the return channel.

===SEAlink===
One of the first third-party mailers for the FidoNet system was SEAdog, written by the same author as the then-popular .arc data compression format. SEAdog included a wide variety of improvements, including SEAlink, an improved transfer protocol based on the same sliding window concept as WXmodem. It differed from WXmodem mostly in details.

One difference is that SEAlink supported the &quot;zero packet&quot; introduced by TeLink, which is needed in order to operate as a drop-in replacement for TeLink in FidoNet systems where the header was expected. codice_21s and codice_1s were extended to three-byte &quot;packets&quot;, starting with the codice_21 or codice_1, then the packet number, then the complement of the packet number, in the same fashion as the original XMODEM packet header. The window size was normally set to six packets.

SEAlink was not expected to operate over X.25 or similar links, and thus did not perform escaping. This was also needed so the zero packet would work properly, as this standard used the codice_14 character that WXmodem had re-purposed. On top of these changes, it added an &quot;Overdrive&quot; mode for half duplex links. This suppressed ACKs for packets that were successfully transferred, in effect making the window of infinite size. This mode was indicated by a flag in the zero block.

SEAlink later added a number of other improvements and was a useful general-purpose protocol. However, it remained rare outside the FidoNet world, and was rarely seen in user-facing software.

===XMODEM-1K===
Another way to solve the throughput problem is to increase the packet size. Although the fundamental problem of latency remains, the speed at which it becomes a problem is higher. XMODEM-1K with 1024-byte packets was the most popular such solution. In this case, the throughput at 9600 bit/s is 81%, given the same assumptions as above.

XMODEM-1K was an expanded version of XMODEM-CRC, which indicated the longer block size in the &quot;sender&quot; by starting a packet with the &lt;STX&gt; character instead of &lt;SOH&gt;. Like other backward-compatible XMODEM extensions, it was intended that a -1K transfer could be started with any implementation of XMODEM on the other end, backing off features as required.

XMODEM-1K was originally one of the many improvements to XMODEM introduced by Chuck Forsberg in his YMODEM protocol. Forsberg suggested that the various improvements were optional, expecting software authors to implement as many of them as possible. Instead, they generally implemented the bare minimum, leading to a profusion of semi-compatible implementations, and eventually, the splitting out of the name &quot;YMODEM&quot; into &quot;XMODEM-1K&quot; and a variety of YMODEMs. Thus XMODEM-1K actually post-dates YMODEM, but remained fairly common anyway.

===NMODEM===
NMODEM is a file transfer protocol developed by L. B. Neal, who released it in 1990. NMODEM is essentially a version of XMODEM-CRC using larger 2048 byte blocks, as opposed to XMODEM&#x27;s 128 byte blocks.
NMODEM was implemented as a separate program, written in Turbo Pascal 5.0 for the IBM PC compatible family of computers. The block size was chosen to match the common cluster size of the MS-DOS FAT file system on contemporary hard drives, making buffering data for writing simpler.

===Protocol spoofing===
Over reliable (error-free) connections, it is possible to eliminate latency by &quot;pre-acknowledging&quot; the packets, a technique known more generally as &quot;protocol spoofing&quot;. This is normally accomplished in the link hardware, notably Telebit modems. The modems, when the option was turned on, would notice the XMODEM header and immediately sent an codice_21. This would cause the sending XMODEM program to immediately send the next packet, making the transfer continuous, like an infinite-sized window. The modems also suppress the codice_21 being sent by the XMODEM software at the far end, thereby freeing up the low-speed return channel.

The system can also be implemented in the protocol itself, and variations of XMODEM offered this feature. In these cases, the receiver would send the codice_21 as soon as the packet started, in the same fashion as the Telebit modems. Since this feature is only an alteration of the receiver-side behavior, it does not require any changes in the protocol on the sender&#x27;s side. YMODEM formalized this system.

This concept should be contrasted with the one used in SEAlink, which changes the behavior on both sides of the link. In SEAlink, the receiver stops sending the codice_21 entirely, and the sender changes its behavior to not expect them.

<text>YMODEM is a file transfer protocol used between microcomputers connected together using modems. It was primarily used to transfer files to and from bulletin board systems. YMODEM was developed by Chuck Forsberg as an expansion of XMODEM and was first implemented in his CP/M YAM program. Initially also known as YAM, it was formally given the name &quot;YMODEM&quot; in 1985 by Ward Christensen, author of the original XMODEM.

YMODEM extended XMODEM in three ways, combining features found in other extended XMODEM varieties. Like XMODEM-CRC, YMODEM replaced the 8-bit checksum with a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), but made it the default form of correction instead of optional. From TeLink it added the &quot;block 0&quot; header that sent the filename and size, which allowed batch transfers (multiple files in a single session) and eliminated the need to add padding at the end of the file. Finally, YMODEM allowed the block size to be increased from the original 128 bytes of data to 1024, as in XMODEM-1k, which greatly improved throughput on faster modems.

Forsberg built the standard with all of these features as runtime options, allowing a single protocol driver to fall back to XMODEM-CRC or even XMODEM when connecting to non-YAM systems. He believed that programmers would want to implement as many of these features as possible on any given platform. He was dismayed to find that the majority of implementations were actually providing nothing more than 1k block size with CRC-16, failing to implement the &quot;block 0&quot; while continuing to use the YMODEM name. The result was the release of many mutually incompatible YMODEM implementations, and the use of the name YMODEM Batch to clearly indicate those versions that did support the complete standard.

==Features==
===XMODEM===
The original XMODEM was a very simple protocol and that is the reason for its success; it could be implemented on practically any machine of the era, even those with very limited processors and storage. It worked by breaking up the data to be sent into 128-byte packets, adding a 3-byte header and 1-byte checksum footer, and sending the resulting 132-byte packets out in order. The receiving computer recalculated the checksum from the 128 bytes of data, and if it matched the checksum sent in the footer it sent back an , and if it did not match, a . When the sender received an it sent the next packet, while a caused it to re-send the last one.

There were a number of problems with the protocol. The use of a simple checksum meant some common errors could go unnoticed. The small packet size and requirement to wait for the or led to slow performance on higher speed links or ones with significant latency. Finally, as the transfer contained no details of the file, every file had to be manually started, which could be a chore when many small files were being transferred.

Solutions to these problems were developed during the early 1980s. XMODEM-CRC replaced the checksum with a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which was much more resistant to common errors. XMODEM-1k expanded the packet size from 128 bytes to 1024, improving performance on higher-speed connections, while others, like WXMODEM and SEAlink instead introduced sliding window systems to combat both performance and latency, at the cost of some complexity. Still others, like TeLink and MODEM7, added file information so that a single transfer could contain multiple files, allowing batches of files to be sent with a single command.

===YMODEM===
Chuck Forsberg, author of the CP/M &quot;Yet Another Modem program&quot;, or YAM, decided to write a single protocol driver that supported many features compared to XMODEM and called it YMODEM. When the users started a transfer they could indicate which options they wanted on the command line, for instance, saying they wished to use CRC. The protocol was written so that it would attempt this style, but gracefully fall-back to match whatever capabilities the remote software did implement.

====Abort====
One problem with the original XMODEM was that there was no defined way to abort the transfer once started. The normal solution was to send s to every subsequent packet if the user requested it. Since the XMODEM protocol defined a limit of ten s to abort a send, and each packet might take a second to send, this meant there was a ten second delay where the sender continually sent data that was simply ignored.

Some implementations had added the ability to send a instead of or at the end of a received packet to indicate an abort. Unfortunately, there was the possibility that a could be generated by line noise and trigger an abort. YAM thus modified this slightly to require two s back-to-back, which would immediately perform a &quot;graceful abort&quot; on the sender end.

====CRC====
CRC support had been introduced in XMODEM-CRC. This was a very simple change to the original protocol; if requested, the receiver would attempt to trigger the transfer by sending an initial instead of a . If the remote sender supported the CRC option, it would begin sending packets as normal, but with a 16-bit CRC in the footer rather than the 1-byte checksum. YAM supported this option with no changes.

====1k====
1024-byte packets had been introduced in XMODEM-1k. This version did not change the trigger character from the receiver, so there was no way for the sender to know whether the receiver supported larger packets. Instead, XMODEM-1k was presented as a separate protocol on both ends of the connection. When such a connection was started, the sender could choose to send either 1024 bytes in a packet or 128, indicating the larger with an character in the header rather than the normal . Normally only the last few packets would use the smaller packets, to avoid sending large amounts of padding. 1k also assumed CRC for all connections. YAM supported 1k with no changes.

====Zero packet====
In order to support automated transfers of FidoNet mail, MODEM7 introduced the ability to send the filename as plain text before sending the first block of data. This was not reliable, and TeLink improved this by placing the filename, and optionally other data like the creation date and file length, in a complete 128-byte packet. XMODEM started transfers with packet number one, so TeLink sent this packet as number zero. This &quot;zero packet&quot; or &quot;block zero&quot; became common in other FidoNet systems like SEAlink and others.

YAM supported the zero packet format, but it was ignored by many 3rd party implementations of YMODEM. When one implementation attempted to send the zero packet to a non-aware version, the receiver would naturally the packet, as packet zero is illegal. The sender would then see the as a transmission error and try to send the packet again, attempting this ten times before failing.

For reasons that are not entirely clear, many implementations of YMODEM did not implement this feature. Because they were unaware of it, they sent a , triggering a series of resend attempts before failing out. This meant that if the user chose to use a compliant YMODEM with a non-compliant version, the transfers would fail. Nevertheless, such non-compliant versions were common.

As a result, it was common to see both YMODEM and YMODEM Batch listed as two separate protocols. Further confusion was created by the similarity between XMODEM-1k and these non-compliant YMODEMs, which were similar to the point that they were often incorrectly listed as the same.

==Streaming support==
YMODEM-G is a streaming variant used for error-free connections. It does not wait for an ACK to be received before sending the next packet; XON/XOFF is used for flow control. The protocol is faster than YMODEM because no latency is introduced between packets, but has no capability for correcting errors. It is reliant on the underlying connection being error-free, which is the case for modems supporting MNP for instance.

Normally, a YMODEM transfer would be started by the receiver sending a to indicate it wants to use the 128-byte format with CRC, or if it wishes to use the original checksum system. When g-protocol is desired, the transfer is instead triggered by sending a . If the sender does not support the g-protocol, it considers this to be an error and ignores it, but if it does support g it begins sending packets in a continual stream. It only expects a single after the final packet is received, which is indicated by the presence of an character in the data. YMODEM-g assumes 1k packets are available.

However, despite this protocol potentially being faster than ZMODEM it was still rarely used. This was partially due to the lack of other functionality, but also a more serious issue. Before the emergence of the 16550 UART, there was a substantial risk of buffer overrun on the serial port. Although this would be detected by YMODEM-g it could not be corrected since no block re-transmission is possible. The receiver would have to cancel and restart the whole transmission from the beginning. ZMODEM on the other hand has transfer resume capability which made it more appealing.

<text>The Garden Palace was a large, purpose-built exhibition building constructed to house the Sydney International Exhibition in 1879 in Sydney, Australia. In 1882 it was completely destroyed by fire.
It was designed by James Barnet and constructed by John Young, at a cost of £191,800 in only eight months. This was largely due to the importation from England of electric lighting, which enabled work to be carried

==Description and history==
A reworking of London&#x27;s Crystal Palace, the plan for the Garden Palace was similar to that of a large cathedral, having a long hall with lower aisle on either side, like a nave, and a transept of similar form, each terminating in towers and meeting beneath a central dome. The successful contractor was John Young, a highly experienced building contractor who had worked on the Crystal Palace for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and locally on the General Post Office and Exhibition Building at Prince Alfred Park.

The dome was in diameter and in height. The building was over 244 metres long and had a floor space of over 112,000 metres with 4.5 million feet of timber, 2.5 million bricks and 243 tons of galvanised corrugated iron. The building was similar in many respects to the later Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. Sydney&#x27;s first hydraulic lift, was contained in the north tower, enabling visitors to climb the tower. The Garden Palace was sited at what is today the southwestern end of the Royal Botanic Garden (although at the time it was built it occupied land that was outside the Garden and in The Domain). It was constructed primarily from timber, which ensured its complete destruction when engulfed by fire in the early morning of 22 September 1882.
The Garden Palace at that time was used by a number of Government Departments and many significant records were destroyed in the fire, notably records of squatting occupation in New South Wales. Between 500 and 1000 pieces of Sydney Aboriginal artefacts were also lost in this fire.

The only extant remains of the Garden Palace are its carved Sydney sandstone gateposts and wrought iron gates, located on the Macquarie Street entrance to the Royal Botanical Garden.
A 1940s-era sunken garden and fountain featuring a statue of Cupid marks the former location of the Palace&#x27;s dome. Few artefacts from the International Exhibition survived the fire. An 1878 Bechstein concert grand piano, that won a first prize, had luckily been removed from the Garden Palace prior to the fire, and is held by the Powerhouse Museum. A number of items are held by the State Library of NSW relating to The Garden Palace include a piece of glass melted by the fire, a handkerchief and a book, The Sydney Garden Palace : a patriotic and historical poem by Frederick Cumming.

<text>The Tarantul-class corvette, Soviet designation Project 1241 &quot;Molniya&quot; () are a class of Russian missile corvettes (large missile cutters in Soviet classification). 

They have the NATO reporting name Tarantul (not to be confused with the , whose official Soviet name is also Project 205P &quot;Tarantul&quot;). These ships were designed to replace the Project 205M &quot;Tsunami&quot; missile cutter (NATO: ).

==Development==

In the late 1970s, the Soviets realised the need for a larger, more seaworthy craft with better gun armament and higher positioned air search radars. In the Tarantul class, both the single main gun and the two Gatling-type guns are used for air defence, together with a comprehensive electronic warfare suite. The boats are built by the Petrovsky yard (St. Petersburg), Rybinsk and Ulis yard (Vladivostok). A version of these ships for coastal anti-submarine warfare and patrol was developed as the or Project 1241.2. The Indian Navy paid approximately $30 million each to license-produce Tarantul-I in the early 1990s. With over 30 sales on the export market the Tarantul has been a relative success for the Russian shipbuilding industry.

==Versions==

===Project 1241.1 (NATO: Tarantul-II)===

The naming convention for NATO reporting name Tarantul was a special case here. NATO called the first version of the class as Tarantul-II, given that they had a better sensor suite/equipment than the ships of the following class Tarantul-I, which was produced exclusively for export.

A first version was based on the Pauk-class hull, though with significantly increased weight. Equipped with four SS-N-2 &#x27;Styx&#x27; anti-ship missiles (either the range P-15 &#x27;Termit&#x27; missile or the later P-20 variant with range) and the associated &#x27;Plank Shave&#x27; radar targeting system ( range in active mode of surveillance, range in passive mode, with an added air surveillance capability). One AK–176 76.2 mm main gun and two AK-630 30 mm six-barreled Gatling guns, the latter CIWS system supported by the &#x27;Bass Tilt&#x27; targeting radar. Furthermore, there is a Fasta-N SA-N-5 quadruple MANPADS launcher and two PK-16 decoy launchers.

Propulsion is a COGOG system (COmbined Gas Or Gas) consisting of two M70 at high power gas turbines with a combined output for full power and two cruise gas turbines type M75 with a combined output of . Top speed is .

Between 1979 and 1984, 13 ships of the type were built. Another ship, R-55, was rebuilt after its completion as a test vessel for the &#x27;Kortik&#x27; short-range defense system for Project 1241.7.

===Project 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I)===

To clarify, by NATO&#x27;s definition, Project 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I) was an export version of Project 1241.1 (NATO: Tarantul-II).

This class of ships could be distinguished by the lack of fire control radar on the roof of the bridge. Instead, the fire control radar, X-band &quot;Garpun-Bal&quot; (NATO: &quot;Plank Shave&quot;), built for the anti-ship missiles, was installed on the top of the mast. Other equipment included a small navigation radar type &quot;Kivach-2&quot; on the bridge roof (or MR-312 &quot;Pechera-1&quot; on the ships of Poland), and the gun-fire control radar MR-123 Vympel (NATO: &quot;Bass Tilt&quot;) at the foot of the mast. Two PK-16 decoy launchers were also installed. The model of the missiles in the KT-138 launch containers were P-20 (NATO: SS-N-2B), basically they were P-15 updated with the new guidance system but with the original 40 km range.

Between 1977 and 1979, 22 ships of this class were produced exclusively for export. Only one of these ships, R-26, was retained by the Soviet Navy for training purposes. India bought five of these ships as s, and would later produce eight ships of the same class domestically. Vietnam also bought four Project 1241.RE ships from various sources over the years.

===Project 12411 (1241.1M/1241.1MR) (NATO: Tarantul-III/Tarantul-III Mod)===

Retaining the main armament and basic hull form of the 1241.RE (NATO: Tarantul-I) class, 1241.1M (NATO: Tarantul-III) received important upgrades. Apart from a modest but useful internal redesign, the Tarantul-III had a new type of propulsion—a CODAG (COmbined Diesel And Gas) system. Two M-70 gas turbines (rated at 12,000 hp each) and two M510 (rated at 4,000 hp each) diesel engines were used, being a big improvement over the earlier COGOG system both in terms of serviceability (the two cruise diesels being almost something of a Soviet &#x27;classic&#x27;), fuel efficiency and, most importantly, service life expectancy compared to the older NK-12Ms. The maximum speed reached .

The superstructures were redesigned and the angled mast of the previous projects has been replaced by a narrow, straight lattice. The sensor position remained almost the same as the Project 1241.1. The &quot;Pechera&quot; navigation radar was off the roof of the bridge, with the MR-123 &quot;Vympel&quot; fire control radar installed. Two jamming system (NATO: &quot;Wine Glass&quot;) were installed on both sides at the foot of the mast. The reason for this was the installation of four SS-N-22 &#x27;Sunburn&#x27; supersonic ship-to-ship missiles with a range of at least 100 km. The associated radar system is the L-band &#x27;Band Stand&#x27; radar, with a 120 km active and passive range and the capability to track 15 different targets. The missiles can also receive third party guidance through the &#x27;Light Bulb&#x27; uplink (from other ships, helicopters or long range patrol aircraft). Cannon armament is retained, as were the PK-16 launchers, although Soviet Navy ships benefited from the improved SA-N-8 quadruple MANPADS launcher. At least one ship had an SA-N-11 Kashtan gun and missile CIWS installed instead of the AK-630s.

The Tarantul-III, built from 1987 on, received an improved electronic countermeasures suite, consisting of two &#x27;Half Hat&#x27; and two &#x27;Foot Ball&#x27; jamming systems, coupled to four improved PK-10 decoy launchers. At least 24 of these ships were built for the Soviet Navy before production ended in 1992.

Between 1985 and 2001, 34 ships of this class were built. After the construction of first batch of 11 ships, the anti-ship missiles were changed from the P-80 &quot;Moskit&quot; to the more modern model P-270 &quot;Moskit-M&quot;, therefore the following 23 boats had a new ID: Project 1241.1MR.

The guided missile corvette &quot;R-60&quot; was further modernized in 2005, having the two AK-630M CIWS removed, and replaced with &quot;Palash&quot; CIWS.

===Project 1242.1/1241.8 &#x27;Molniya&#x27;===

Project 1242.1 and project 1241.8 &quot;Molniya&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;) are further developments of the Tarantul family of ships. The two projects has been modified and rearmed with modern missile systems like the Uran-E and are more capable ships than the Tarantul types. The ships are built by the Russian Vympel Shipyard. Russia received at least one boat for trials in the 1990s and in 1999 Vietnam ordered two vessels. Vietnam is currently the main user of the Molniya class, with two Russian-made ships and six locally built ships. Vietnam started its own production line of 1241.8 Molniya ships with the assistance of Almaz Central Design Bureau in Russia. The first two locally built ships were delivered in July 2014, two more in June 2015, and the last two in October 2017. The Vietnamese warships are armed with a AK-176 76 mm gun, 16 Uran-E anti-ship missiles, four Igla-M air-defence missiles and two AK-630 close-in-weapon systems. The Vietnamese ships are also larger at in length and a maximum displacement of 563 tons. They have a range of with 44 crew members on board. The Indian Navy ordered four further modified 1241.8 Tarantuls, this order was later reduced to two. These last two ships of the &quot;Veer&quot; class are armed with 16 SS-N-25 &#x27;Switchblade&#x27; / URAN E missiles, a OTO Melara 76 mm gun instead of the AK-176, and MR 352 Positiv-E (NATO: Cross Dome) radar. In 2009 Libya ordered three ships, however, the civil war in 2011 put a stop to any acquisitions. Shortly afterwards Turkmenistan acquired three Type 1241.8 vessels, possibly those that had been ordered by Libya but not delivered.

The Russian Navy received two upgraded &quot;Molniya&quot;-class missile boats in early 2019; they were initially built for a foreign customer, but the contract was cancelled, so the Russian Navy acquired them. The boats replaced the Moskit with eight Kh-35U anti-ship missiles and MANPADS launcher with the Pantsir-M gun/missile system. They also had a modern radar phased antenna array. One boat was expected to operate in the Black Sea and the other in the Caspian Sea.

==Surviving Ships==

Two Tarantul-class corvettes are preserved globally, with a third boat potentially also preserved as of September 2024.

* Hans Beimler (575) is preserved in Peenemünde, Germany. The ship was one of five corvettes of this class built for the Volksmarine, and served between 1986 and 1991. 

* INS Nishank (K43) is preserved at the National Maritime Heritage Complex, Lothal, India. Nishank was built as part of the Veer-class for the Indian Navy, a modified variant of the Tarantul design, and served between 1987 and 2022. She was subsequently transferred for preservation in 2023.

* Tambovsky Komsomolets (formerly R-47) has been preserved at Patriot Park in Kronstadt, Russia. She served between 1987 and 2017. She was moored next to the destroyer Bespokoyny (herself a museum), and was seen at the museum as late as May 2022. However, as of August, she is no longer moored at the position.

In addition, another ex-German ship of the class, the ex-Rudolf Egelhofer (772), which served between 1986 and 1991, and was then transferred to the United States as USNS Hiddensee in 1992 for evaluation, serving until 1996, was preserved at Battleship Cove, Massachusetts, United States of America in 1997. However, she fell into disrepair, and due to deteriorating condition, the ship was scrapped in October 2023.

<text>Jan Carel Josephus van Speyk (31 January 1802 – 5 February 1831) was a Dutch naval lieutenant commander with the United Netherlands Navy who became a hero in the Netherlands for his opposition to the Belgian Revolution.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Amsterdam in 1802, Van Speyk was orphaned at the age of 10. When he was 18 years old, he joined the United Netherlands Navy and served in the Dutch East Indies from 1823 to 1825. He successfully attacked Bangka and Java, which earned him the nickname &quot;Terror of the Bandits&quot; ().

When the Belgian Revolution began, Van Speyk was given command of a gunboat. Van Speyk despised the Belgian independence movement, and he said he would rather die &quot;than become an infamous Brabander&quot;.

=== Death ===
On 5 February 1831, a gale blew his gunboat into the quay at the port of Antwerp. The Belgians quickly stormed his ship, demanding Van Speyk haul down the Dutch flag. Rather than surrender his ship, he fired a pistol (some versions say he threw a lighted cigar) into a barrel of gunpowder in the ship&#x27;s magazine. According to legend he shouted, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be blown up then&quot;. The number of Belgians killed is unknown, though it probably numbered in the dozens. Twenty-eight of his 31 crewmen also perished in the blast.

==== Legacy ====

Eight days&#x27; after Van Speyk&#x27;s death, the Netherlands declared a period of mourning. His remains were buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, where the remains of Dutch naval hero Michiel de Ruyter also are interred.

Van Speyk is regarded as a naval hero in the Netherlands. This resulted in a royal decree (Koninklijk Besluit number 81, 11 February 1833) issued by King William I pronouncing that as long as the Dutch Navy exists there will always be a ship named &quot;Van Speijk&quot; to preserve his memory. Seven ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy ships have carried this name, the latest being of 1994, a . Her predecessor, the frigate , launched in 1965, was the lead ship of her own class. The mast of Van Speyk&#x27;s ship is preserved at the Royal Netherlands Naval College.

For his actions related to the bombardment of Antwerp, as captain of Gunboat Number 2, Van Speyk was decorated with the Knight&#x27;s Cross (4th class) of the Military Order of William. A national memorial in his honour is located at the J.C.J. van Speijk Lighthouse in Egmond aan Zee.

<text>Xpress Transport Protocol (XTP) is a transport layer protocol for high-speed networks promoted by the XTP Forum developed to replace TCP. XTP provides protocol options for error control, flow control, and rate control. Instead of separate protocols for each type of communication, XTP controls packet exchange patterns to produce different models, e.g. reliable datagrams, transactions, unreliable streams, and reliable multicast connections.

Long latency is one of the major problems in satellite communications. Couple this with possible environmental variables and sometimes asymmetrical bandwidth conditions, the quality of service in satellite communications is sometimes lacking. XTP addresses these issues in a variety of ways such as a Selective Retransmission algorithm that deals with loss recovery. This works by the receiver detecting missing data packets and transmitting a list of those missing packets to the sender, who then is able to quickly resend missing packets as needed. As stated, XTP also provides rate control in which the maximum bandwidth can be specified as well as what size burst data can be accepted. XTP also offers a reliable multicast protocol, and the flexibility to match any specific application needs.

XTP does not employ congestion avoidance algorithms. XTP is a real-time option at Layer 4 for the US Navy SAFENET LAN Profile.

<doc id="1117788" wikidata="Q4659637" url="?curid=1117788" title="A Softer World">
<text>A Softer World is a webcomic by the writer Joey Comeau and artist Emily Horne, both Canadians. It was first published online on 7 February 2003 and was released three times a week until its end in June 2015. Before starting the website in 2003, the comics had been published in zine form. With the launch of the website, the comic gained wider recognition, most notably when Warren Ellis linked to the comic on his blog, and then began to feature it as a &quot;Favored Puny Human&quot;. It appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for a short time until a change of editors caused it to be removed. Between 2008 and 2010, science fiction-themed strips of &quot;A Softer World&quot; were also produced and published on Tor.com.

== Format ==

With occasional exceptions for double-length strips, each comic is three panels long. The three panels are made up of photographic art, either a series of three photographs, or one photograph that is spread over multiple frames, or repeated with different crops and zooms. Short text is added over the photographs. The photos do not illustrate the text directly, instead presenting a similar tone, or being in conflict.

The strip grew out of work by Comeau that started in 2001 which used magazine about royalty as the illustrations. The photographs for &quot;A Softer World&quot; were taken by Horne, then sent to Comeau for text. Horne said that the two were more collaborative when they lived in the same city and the process for making the strips changed when Horne moved away.

The tone of the comic tends to be absurdist and dark, with the punchlines often being both humorous and disturbing. Horne stated that &quot;Even those [strips] that are overtly hilarious usually manage to make you feel a bit guilty about your laughter. ... Few things are black-and-white, funny-or-not-funny, and &quot;ASW&quot; reflects that.&quot; The strip occasionally features text with overt sexual content; for example, the strip from which the comic&#x27;s title comes from reads, &quot;In the caves behind my house, I found a softer world. / They understand what I had to do for love. / They don&#x27;t believe in restraining orders.&quot; Recurring themes include sexuality, accidents or disasters, and the supernatural.

Hovering one&#x27;s cursor over the comic will prompt the image title to appear, which contains an extra punchline or commentary related to the strip overall. In May 2010, a feature was added to display this text when clicking or tapping on the comic image, for users on mobile phones and touchscreen devices, which lack a &quot;hovering&quot; function. In hardcopy versions, the extra text appeared under the comic.

== Reception ==
In a 2004 review, Dani Atkinson wrote for Sequential Tart: &quot;The strips read like the first lines of a novel, the kind of really good first lines that manage to evoke the whole novel. Or a sort of ... post-modern haiku. They&#x27;re blackly funny, or oddly touching, or creepy.&quot;

The website The Webcomics Examiner included &quot;A Softer World&quot; in its list of 25 &quot;Best Webcomics of 2005&quot;, saying &quot;the sly inferences in each Softer World strip are variously acidic, achingly funny, or casually disturbing.&quot; The comic won the first Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Award for photographic webcomic in 2007.

&quot;A Softer World&quot; was profiled in the September 2007 issue of the Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In a 2008 article for ComicMix, reviewer Rick Marshall said the strip &quot;is always a gamble. One strip can prompt hysterical laughter, while the next can only make you shiver and wonder what the unholy hell was going on in its creators&#x27; minds when &quot;that&quot; strip was conceived. &quot;ASW&quot; can explore complex social issues one moment and the depth of depravity in the next.&quot;

Writing after the final strip, Gary Tyrrel of Fleen called the series &quot;one thousand two hundred and forty-three perfect little pillows of hope/despair, melancholy/sanguinity, [and] sexiness/moresexiness&quot;.

== Other features of the site ==
The website asofterworld.com was also used to host other creative works by Horne and Comeau:

* &quot;&quot;i blame the sea&quot; is Emily Horne&#x27;s photo journal, added to the site in 2008 and updated weekly.
* &quot;Overqualified&quot; is a series of satirical cover letters for job applications. These cover letters are generally written so as to reveal a degree of insanity in the imagined author. For example, one is a letter from someone applying to be a mall Santa Claus, in which he explains that, as a foreman at Mattel, he fired all the middle aged men and hired midgets who he forced to wear green costumes, and that, after being fired, he broke into houses to steal milk and cookies. &quot;Overqualified&quot; was published in book form in 2009.
* &quot;i am other people&quot;&quot; is a series of interviews that Joey conducts with people.
* &quot;Lockpick Pornography&quot;, Comeau&#x27;s first novel, was first serialized on the &quot;A Softer World&quot; website before publication.

== Collected editions ==

<text>Zhouzhuang (; Wu: &quot;Tseu-zaon&quot;) is a water town known for its canals in Jiangsu province, China. It is located within the administrative area of Kunshan, 30 km southeast of the city centre of Suzhou.

Zhouzhuang is a popular tourist destination, classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. It is noted for its profound cultural background, well preserved ancient residential houses and elegant watery views. A 2017 article in the &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; described Zhouzhuang as &quot;the most famous and most commercialized ancient water town in China,&quot; in addition to noting that its architecture &quot;dates back more than 900 years, with about 60 original brick archways and 100 original courtyards.&quot; It has also been called &quot;Venice of the East&quot;.

&quot;CNN&quot; ranked Zhouzhuang the third most beautiful water town in China in 2017 and included it in its 2019 collection of Asia&#x27;s 13 most picturesque towns.


==History==
In the Spring and Autumn period (770 BC–476 BC), Zhouzhuang was a part of the fief Yaocheng and called Zhenfengli. After being donated to Full Fortune (Quanfu) Temple by Zhou Digong, a devout Buddhist, in 1086 during the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), Zhouzhuang obtained its present name.

==Sights==

===Double Bridges/Twin Bridges (Shuang Qiao)===
Zhouzhuang is surrounded with and divided by lakes and rivers. Many stone bridges cross the rivers, showing distinctive views of the water town. The Double Bridges, which are Shide Bridge and Yongan Bridge, are the most famous and are considered the symbol of Zhouzhuang. Built in the Wanli era (1573–1619) of the Ming dynasty, the Double Bridges are located in the northeast of the town. Shide Bridge is east–west and has a round arch, while Yongan Bridge is north–south and has a square arch. Crossing the two crisscross rivers (Yinzi Creek and Nabeishi River) and connecting at the middle, the Twin Bridges look like an old-style Chinese key. In 1984, 38 canvases of the notable painter, Chen Yifei, were exhibited in a New York gallery of Armand Hammer, then chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. &quot;Memory of Hometown&quot;, also known as &quot;Memory of My Homeland&quot;, which depicted the Double Bridges, was one of the items on display and attracted international attention. 

===Fuan Bridge===
Located at the eastern end of Zhongshi Jie, Fuan Bridge was built in 1355 during the Yuan dynasty. The unique trait of the Fuan is the consummate combination of the single-arch bridge and the bridge towers.

===Shenting House===
Built in 1742 and located at the southeast side of Fuan Bridge, Shenting House was the private property of the descendant of Shen Wansan, the first millionaire of Jiangnan (South of Yangtze River) in the early Ming dynasty. The whole architectural complex is of the Qing&#x27;s style and occupies an area of more than 2,000 square meters (half an acre). Over 100 rooms are divided into three sections and each one is connected by arcades and aisles. The first is the water gate and the wharf, where Shen&#x27;s family moored boats and washed clothes. The middle part includes the gate tower, the tearoom and the main hall. Bricky gate tower carved with lively and ingenious figures which tell the historic stories or show the good wishes, make it a rare artwork. Tea room and main hall are places for serving guests, and the furnishings here are all very elegant. The last section is the two-storied dwelling which consists of several buildings which are quite different from the main hall, more comfortable and refined in pattern and atmosphere. The painted sculpture of legendary Shen Wansan is in Datang Tower; cultural relics including ancient folk instruments are exhibited in Xiaotang Tower and Back Hall.

===Zhangting House===
It was built by the descendants of Xu Kui in the Zhengtong era (1436–1449) of the Ming dynasty and bought by the Zhang family in the early Qing dynasty. Located to the south of the Double Bridges, Zhangting House has more than 70 rooms and takes up about 1,800 square meters (less than half an acre). With Ruojing River flowing through, Zhangting House is a dapper and graceful residential house with a tranquil courtyard and pond. Deep halls offer a peak into the lifestyle of the quondam owner.

===Milou Tower===
Once called the De&#x27;s Tavern, Milou Tower perches next to Zhenfeng Bridge which is at the southwest corner of Zhouzhuang. It is famous for being a rallying place of the literators in old times.

===Chengxu Temple===
Standing on Zhongshi Street on the opposite side of Puqing Bridge, Chengxu Taoist Temple was built during 1086–1093 of the Song dynasty and also known as Sanctity Hall (Shengtang Hall). After several periods of expansion, it became one of the most famous Taoist temples in Wuzhong Region. In an area of 1,500 square meters (1,800 square yards), Shengdi and Doumu halls, Yuhuang, Wenchang and Shengdi pavilions are pieces of Taoist architectures.
== Local food ==

===Wansan pork===
The most famous local food of Zhouzhuang is Wansan pork hock, named after Shen Wansan, the richest man in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasty in Jiangnan.

=== Sanwei Glutinous rice balls ===
Sanwei Glutinous rice balls are commonly called soup gluten. In the area of Jiangnan, rice balls are a delicious dish that every family would make at home.

<doc id="1117791" wikidata="Q2911131" url="?curid=1117791" title="Duke of York Column">
<text>The Duke of York Column is a monument in London, England, to Prince Frederick, Duke of York, the second son of King George III. The designer was Benjamin Dean Wyatt. It is sited where a purposefully wide endpoint of Regent Street, known as Waterloo Place and Gardens, meets The Mall, between the two terraces of Carlton House Terrace and their tree-lined squares. The three very wide flights of steps down to The Mall adjoining are known as the Duke of York Steps. The column was completed in December 1832, and the statue of the Duke of York, by Sir Richard Westmacott, was raised on 10 April 1834.

==History==
Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was the commander-in-chief of the British Army during the French Revolutionary Wars and led the reform of the army into a capable modernised force. The Duke is remembered in the children&#x27;s nursery rhyme &quot;The Grand Old Duke of York&quot;. When he died in 1827, the entire British Army, by general consensus following a proposal of the senior officers, forwent one day&#x27;s wages to pay for a monument to the Duke.

When the sum of subscriptions for a monument to the Duke reached £21,000 (), the committee overseeing the project asked a number of architects to submit proposals, and in December 1830 they chose a design by Benjamin Dean Wyatt. The mason Nowell of Pimlico was contracted to build the column for a sum of £15,760. Excavations for the concrete foundations began on 27 April 1831. The ground was excavated to a layer of natural soil, around below street level. A layer of York stone slabs at a depth of around was used to consolidate the concrete, and another was placed at the top of the foundations, as a base for the masonry. The foundations were completed on 25 June 1831, and construction of the stonework began three weeks later.

On 7 May 1850, Henri Joseph Stephan, a horn player in Benjamin Lumley&#x27;s orchestra at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, committed suicide by falling from the public gallery at the top of the column.

==Description==
The column is of the Tuscan order. It is built of granite from Aberdeenshire; a light grey variety was used for the pedestal, a bluer grey type for the base of the shaft, and &#x27;red&#x27; Peterhead granite (pink/grey) for the shaft of the column. There is an iron railing around the of the capital. Above the column a circular plinth, then a bronze statue of the Duke dressed in the robes of the Knights of the Garter, by Sir Richard Westmacott. The statue is slightly more than twice life-size, at tall and weighs . It was raised into position on 8 April 1834.

The total height of the monument is . The statue faces south-southeast; from its base, there are views of The Mall and St. James&#x27;s Park. The great height of the column caused contemporary wits to joke that the Duke was trying to escape his creditors, for the Duke died £2 million in debt.

Within the column a spiral staircase of 168 steps, lit by narrow apertures, to the viewing platform. Given the small, fragile platform and the previous high demand for access, this column has been closed to the public for many decades.

The column is set at the top of a monumental flight of steps forming a break in Carlton House Terrace, The ensemble was designed by architect John Nash as an emphatic southern termination of his from Regent&#x27;s Park to Westminster, envisaged and mostly realised 1815–1820. The Column, Steps and Terrace occupy the site of the Prince Regent&#x27;s spectacular but short-lived Carlton House. The houses in the Terrace were popular with the gentry and wealthy, later joined by politicians such as William Ewart Gladstone. Both Column and Terrace are Grade I-listed, the houses in the terrace being described as &#x27;palatial&#x27; by Historic England.

<text>Eccles (), also referred to as &#x27;The Famous Eccles&#x27; or &#x27;Mad Dan Eccles&#x27;, is the name of a comedy character, created and performed by Spike Milligan, from the 1950s BBC radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Macreekie Rising of &#x27;74&quot;, Peter Sellers had to fill in for the role in Milligan&#x27;s absence. Very occasionally, he was referred to as &#x27;Field Marshal&#x27; Eccles.

Eccles was one of the show&#x27;s secondary characters, but like his counterpart Bluebottle (portrayed by Sellers), became extremely popular and he is regarded as epitomising the show&#x27;s humour. The Eccles character and his distinctive voicing were strongly influenced by Milligan&#x27;s childhood love for the classic Walt Disney cartoons and specifically Disney&#x27;s anthropomorphic buffoon dog character Goofy. . When Milligan wrote &quot;The Idiot Weekly&quot;, an Australian version of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, Eccles often made appearances in the script.

Milligan visualised Eccles as a tall, lanky, amiable, well-meaning, but incredibly stupid teenager who often found himself involved—usually alongside Bluebottle and Neddie Seagoon—in one of the nefarious schemes created by arch-villain Hercules Grytpype-Thynne. As well as being frequently referred to as being something other than an ordinary human, Eccles also possesses remarkable stupidity when dealing with physical objects; in &quot;The Greatest Mountain in the World&quot; he describes two sticks of dynamite as &quot;What luck! Two big cigars and they&#x27;re both lit!&quot;

<doc id="1117800" wikidata="Q4998417" url="?curid=1117800" title="Bureau of Primary Health Care">
<text>The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) is a part of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. HRSA helps fund, staff and support a national network of health clinics for people who otherwise would have little or no access to care. BPHC funds health centers in underserved communities, providing access to high quality, family oriented, comprehensive primary and preventive health care for people who are low-income, uninsured or face other obstacles to getting health care.
The Bureau is headed by Associate Administrator Jim Macrae and Deputy Associate Administrator Tonya Bowers.

== History ==
The Bureau was formed in 1982 as a merge of the Bureau of Medical Services and the Bureau of Community Health Services.

=== Predecessors ===
The Bureau of Primary Health Care is the direct descendant of the oldest function of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS): the system of Marine Hospitals founded in 1798. When the PHS&#x27;s predecessor, the Marine Hospital Service, first divided itself into divisions in 1899, the hospitals became part of the Division of Marine Hospitals and Relief. In 1944, it was renamed the Division of Hospitals. As part of the PHS reorganizations of 1966–1973, it became part of the Federal Health Programs Service within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration in 1968, and then became the (second) Bureau of Medical Services within the Health Services Administration in 1973. In 1981, budget cuts imposed by the Reagan administration forced the end of PHS hospital system, with the last eight hospitals transferred to other organizations.

The system of Community Health Centers has a different origin. They have their roots in the Migrant Health Act of 1962 and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established funding for the first community-based clinics that were to become today&#x27;s Health Center Program. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided Federal funds for two &quot;neighborhood health centers,&quot; which were launched in 1965 by Jack Geiger and Count Gibson, physicians at Tufts University in Boston. Federal support for entities that would later be called health centers began in 1962 with passage of the Migrant Health Act, which funded medical and support services for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their family members. In the mid-1970s, Congress permanently authorized neighborhood health centers as “community health centers” and “migrant health centers” under sections 329 and 330 of the Public Health Service Act. These programs were initially part of the Office of Economic Opportunity. However, the Nixon administration moved them into the PHS in 1974 as the Bureau of Community Health Services within the Health Services Administration.

=== Merge ===
In 1982, the Health Services Administration merged with the Health Resources Administration to form HRSA. As part of the merge, the Bureau of Medical Services absorbed the Bureau of Community Health Services to form the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance.

In 1987, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau split from the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance.

In 1992, the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance was renamed the Bureau of Primary Health Care. The Bureau of Primary Health Care was reorganized and restructured around 1992 to become more organized and efficient. This resulted in creation of the Office of Minority and Special Populations, the Office of Policy and Program Development, and the Office of Quality and Data. There are also four divisions that were created: Eastern, Central Mid Atlantic, Western and the National Hansen&#x27;s disease program. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the responsibility for managing the Consolidated Health Centers Grant Program.

More recently, the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program was established in 2004.

==Key facts==

* Nearly 1,400 health center grant recipients operate more than 12,000 community-based service delivery sites in every state and territory, giving geographically isolated or economically distressed people access to preventive and primary health care.
* HRSA-supported health centers treated more than 28 million people in 2019. HRSA-funded health centers provide care to 1 out of every 11 people living in the US, including: 1 in 8 children, 1 in 5 rural residents, 1 in 3 living in poverty, and over 389,000 veterans. 
* Since 2001, through a major expansion initiative, HRSA has increased access to primary health care in 1,375 communities through new or expanded clinical sites. During this time, health centers increased their patient base by almost 60 percent, nearly doubled the number of people receiving oral health care, and tripled the number of clients who received mental health and addiction counseling services. 
* The National Hansen&#x27;s Disease Program is the major source of direct patient care, clinician training and research in the field of Hansen&#x27;s Disease and related leprous conditions.
* The Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992 and 1995 granted medical malpractice liability protection through the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) to HRSA-supported health centers. BPHC administers this program through its Office of Quality and Data. The Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program extends this coverage to insures physicians and other clinicians who contribute free health care services in the communities, relieving them of the burden of paying for private liability coverage.

== Health Center Program ==

Health centers are community-based and patient-directed organizations that deliver comprehensive, culturally competent, high-quality primary health care services. Health centers also often integrate access to pharmacy, mental health, substance use disorder, and oral health services in areas where economic, geographic, or cultural barriers limit access to affordable health care services. Health centers deliver care to the Nation&#x27;s most vulnerable individuals and families, including people experiencing homelessness, agricultural workers, residents of public housing, and the Nation&#x27;s veterans.

Health centers are required to be located in or serve a high-need community (a “medically underserved” area or population) — and to make their services available to all patients on a sliding scale, with fees based on ability to pay. By law, health centers must be governed by community boards with majority patient representation.

Looking at national numbers, Health Centers serve:

* 1 in 11 individuals living in the US,
* 1 in 8 children,
*1 in 5 rural residents,
*1 in 3 living in poverty,
* 1 in 5 uninsured,
* over 398,000 veterans,
* 1.4+ million homeless individuals, and 
*1+ million migrant/seasonal farmworkers.

== Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program ==

Free clinics play a significant role in meeting the health care needs of the uninsured, particularly at a time when private physicians may be less likely to provide free care in their offices.

These clinics are typically small organizations with annual budgets of less than $250,000, making them less able to afford the growing cost of malpractice coverage for those clinicians who might otherwise be willing to donate their time.

The Free Clinics Program serves HRSA&#x27;s overall policy aim of expanding treatment capacity for the disadvantaged by assuring health professional volunteers that they will be protected against medical malpractice claims. To date, over 2,800 health care providers have been given federal indemnity through the program.

The community health center is a nonprofit health care agency concerned with health promotion and primary prevention goals for specific populations. Populations may include the homeless, minorities, Medicaid recipients, migrant/seasonal farmworkers, persons infected with HIV/AIDS, the underinsured, and the uninsured. Community health centers are funded by the Bureau of Primary Health Care, U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, via grant money and are located in designated medically underserved areas. The National Association for Community Health Centers and state associations for community health centers are advocates for the local centers. Community health centers are unique in that they employ community health care specialists (e.g., family practice physicians and advanced practice nurses). They provide accessible primary care preventive health services. Their clients include the individual, family, and community; and they have a partnership relationship with the community.

==National Hansen&#x27;s Disease Program==
The National Hansen&#x27;s Disease Program have been providing care and treatment for Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy) and related conditions since 1921. Currently, the National Hansen&#x27;s Disease (Leprosy) Clinical Center is located at Ochsner Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It is &quot;the only facility in the United States devoted to diagnosis, treatment, and research concerning Hansen&#x27;s disease.&quot;

The Clinical Center states that it offers:

The National Hansen&#x27;s Disease (Leprosy) Research Program at the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine in Baton Rouge is a research center that &quot;conducts and supports research in the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of Hansen&#x27;s disease and tuberculosis — aimed at the global elimination of Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy).&quot; The research program maintains the world&#x27;s only &quot;M. leprae&quot;-infected armadillo colony. Twenty-three people work at the Research Program.

The program provides health care to those affected by the disease through three means of service delivery: at HRSA-run facilities in Louisiana; via a payment to a Hawaii in-patient program; or at any of 11 regional outpatient clinics under contract to the agency.

The programs also support scientific research and training for health professionals at the world&#x27;s largest and most comprehensive laboratory dedicated to Hansen&#x27;s Disease.

The programs are the only dedicated source of expertise, treatment and continuing education on the disease in the United States.

Though Hansen&#x27;s disease is very rare in the United States (there are currently only 6500 cases) there is still a widely held stigma because of the history of the disease. With current treatment methods patients become noninfectious after only a few doses of medication. Patients may continue their lives without change during treatment.

This Program has led the development of the treatments for Hansen&#x27;s Disease. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1940s that any effective means of treating this Disease were created. &quot;Guy Henry Faget, MD and his staff demonstrate the efficacy of sulfone drugs, At the end of one year, 15 of 22 patients had improved.&quot;

== Models that Work Campaign ==

The main objective of the Models That Work Campaign (MTW) is improving access to health care for vulnerable and underserved populations. The MTW Campaign is a collaboration between the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and 39 cosponsors including national associations, state and federal agencies, community-based organizations, foundations, and businesses. This initiative gives recognition and visibility to innovative and effective service delivery models. Models are selected based on a set of criteria that includes delivery of high quality primary care services, community participation, integration of health and social services, quantifiable outcomes, and replicability. Winners of the competition are showcased nationally and hired to provide training to other communities, to document and publish their strategies, and to provide onsite technical assistance on request.

MTW staff at HRSA&#x27;s Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) work in collaboration with cosponsors in national and local campaigns to publicize the innovative approaches used by MTW winners. On the federal level for example, HRSA&#x27;s HIV/AIDS Bureau works with MTW staff and cosponsors to develop a series of community based workshops with MTW winners; sharing lessons and advising community leaders, clinicians, and administrators on strategies to improve primary care coordination for populations with high incidencesform, perhaps &quot;incidence&quot;, &quot;incidents&quot;, or &quot;instances&quot; was intended of HIV/AIDS. Innovative strategies are often identified and incorporated into federal technical assistance initiatives and local program design as well.

<doc id="1117821" wikidata="Q574303" url="?curid=1117821" title="Henryk Dobrzański">
<text>Major Henryk Dobrzański (22 June 1897 – 30 April 1940), also known by his nom-de-guerre &quot;Hubal,&quot; was a Polish soldier, sportsman and partisan. He fought in the Polish Legions in World War I, Polish–Ukrainian War of 1918, the Polish–Bolshevik War of 1919–1921 and the Polish September Campaign of 1939. He is however best known as the leader of the partisan unit known as the Detached Unit of the Polish Army which operated in 1939 and early 1940 near Kielce.

Exploits of Dobrzański and his unit, considered the first partisans in Poland and arguably, of World War II, became a legend in Poland already during the war. Known as Hubal, he has been described as Poland&#x27;s last &quot;Romantic Hero&quot; and compared to figures such as Robin Hood, William Tell, Till Eulenspiegel and Davy Crockett.

==Early life and career==
Henryk Dobrzański was born on 22 June 1897 in Jasło, Austria-Hungary to a Polish noble family (Coat of arms of Leliwa), of Henryk Dobrzański de Hubal and Maria Dobrzańska née Lubieniecka. In 1912, he joined &quot;Drużyny Strzeleckie&quot;, a Polish pro-independence youth organisation. When World War I broke out, he volunteered to join Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions. He served with distinction in the 2nd Regiment of Uhlans and participated in many battles such as Stawczany and Battle of Rarańcza. In 1918 after Poland regained its independence, he joined the Polish Army.

Dobrzański took part in the Polish–Ukrainian War of 1918 and fought with his cavalry platoon during the Siege of Lwów. He participated in Polish–Bolshevik War of 1919-1921. For his bravery, he was awarded the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military award, and four times the Krzyż Walecznych, in addition to many other military awards.

After the Peace of Riga, he remained in the Polish Army. He became a member of the Polish equestrian team, winning many international competitions. He also took part in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and came fourth at the prestigious Aldershot competition. In his sports career, he gained 22 gold, three silver and four bronze medals altogether.

==World War II==
Shortly before the 1939 Invasion of Poland he was assigned to the 110th Reserve Cavalry Regiment [pl] as a deputy commander. His unit was to enter combat as a second-line formation, but fast advances of the Wehrmacht made the completion of training impossible. On 11 September it was moved to Wołkowysk, from where it marched towards Grodno and Augustów Forest. It fought several skirmishes against the German army and after the Soviet invasion of Poland took part in the defense of the city against the Red Army.

After two days of heavy fighting against the numerically superior Soviets, on 20 September Grodno was lost and three days later gen. bryg. Wacław Przeździecki, the commander of the defense of the Grodno area, ordered all his troops to escape to neutral Lithuania. According to another account that order was given shortly after the Soviet invasion begun, around 17 or 18 September. In either, case, the 110th Regiment did not obey this order. The unit joined with the remnants of several routed regiments and fought its way towards the capital Warsaw. It got surrounded by the Red Army in the Biebrza river area and suffered serious casualties, but managed to break through the enemy defenses. After that, Lieutenant Colonel Jerzy Dąbrowski, the commander of the regiment, decided his unit should disband. A group of approximately 180 men wanted to continue, and Dobrzański took command of them and led them towards Warsaw, which was under siege. He named his force the &quot;Detached Unit of the Polish Army&quot; (&quot;Oddział Wydzielony Wojska Polskiego&quot;), a term first recorded on 24 September, when the unit was near the Woźnawieś village in the Podlasie region.

Warsaw capitulated on 27 September, before Dobrzański and his men were able to reach it. That left him faced with three choices: disband, evacuate (via Hungary or Romania) to France, or continue the fight. Approximately 50 men volunteered to continue the fight. He led his unit southwards to try to break out and reach France. On 1 October 1939 they crossed the Vistula near Dęblin and started their march towards the Holy Cross Mountains. The next day his unit, previously avoiding engaging the German units, launched its first attack, when it successfully ambushed a bogged German convoy. After that he decided to stay in the Kielce area with his unit and wait until the Allied relief came, which he expected in the spring of 1940. He also swore that he would not take off his uniform until after the war. On 6 October the Battle of Kock ended the resistance of the last major unit of the Polish Army. With the support of the local civilian population, Hubal and his men managed to evade the Germans for several months.

In March 1940 his unit inflicted heavy casualties on a number of German units in ambushes. The German authorities responded with reprisals against the civil population, burning several villages and killing an estimated 1200 civilians in what is known in the Polish historiography as the Hubal pacifications. Due to these reprisals local sentiment turned against Hubal&#x27;s unit, and the newly formed ZWZ became concerned that this would inhibit their ability to recruit. The ZWZ and the Government Delegate&#x27;s Office at Home ordered Hubal to disband his unit. He refused to do so.

==Death and legacy==
On 30 April 1940 his staff quarters, in a ravine near the village of Anielin (near Opoczno), were ambushed. During the battle Dobrzański and one of his men were killed. The Germans desecrated his body and put it on public view in the local villages. They then transported it to Tomaszów Mazowiecki and either burnt it or buried it in an unknown location. The remnants of the &quot;Detached Unit of the Polish Army&quot; continued the struggle until 25 June 1940, when it was disbanded. The exact place of Hubal&#x27;s burial remains uncertain to this day, despite efforts to locate it.

Hubal and his unit have been a subject of a number of literary works, including Melchior Wańkowicz&#x27;s &quot;Hubalczycy&quot; as early as 1946. Hubal has been described as Poland&#x27;s last &quot;Romantic Hero&quot; and compared to figures such as Robin Hood, William Tell, Till Eulenspiegel and Davy Crockett..

In 1949 Dobrzański&#x27;s son, Ludwik, emigrated to England and became a property developer. He died on 15 December 1990 in Bedford.

In 1966 Henryk Dobrzański was posthumously awarded the Golden Cross of the Virtuti Militari and promoted to colonel. Currently almost 200 organisations and institutions bear his name, including 82 Scouting groups, 31 schools and several military units. There are streets named after him in almost every Polish city.

In 1973 the film &quot;Hubal&quot;, based on his resistance campaign, was released.

The pseudonym &quot;Hubal&quot; comes from his family coat of arms.

==Decorations==
Military decorations awarded to Henyrk Dobrzański include:
* Order of Polonia Restituta Grand Cross (posthumously in 2010)
* Order Virtuti Militari Golden Cross (posthumously in 1966)
* Order Virtuti Militari Silver Cross

The moments formula_10 exist for formula_11

The distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891 – 1966).

== Generating random variates ==

Given a random variate formula_12 drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval formula_13 then the variate

:formula_14

has a Type-2 Gumbel distribution with parameter formula_15 and formula_16 This is obtained by applying the inverse transform sampling-method.

==Related distributions==

* The special case formula_17 yields the Fréchet distribution.

* Substituting formula_18 and formula_19 yields the Weibull distribution. Note, however, that a positive formula_20 (as in the Weibull distribution) would yield a negative formula_15 and hence a negative probability density, which is not allowed.

<text>The Stratton Lock and Dam (known until 1991 as the McHenry Dam, officially named the William G. Stratton - Thomas A. Bolger Lock and Dam) is a dam in Nunda Township, McHenry County, Illinois. It is named after former Governor William Stratton and Representative Thomas A. Bolger. The dam is the only dam on the Fox River (Illinois, USA) that is served by a lock system.

== Construction ==
The first dam at the site was a wooden dam built in 1907. This dam deteriorated and was replaced by a steel sheet piling design sometime before 1915. A lock was constructed at the same time as this dam. The lock and dam were conveyed to the Illinois DNR in 1923-24. Significant damage to the structure occurred during flooding in November 1937 and July 1938. Due to this damage, the State of Illinois Department of Public Works and Buildings, Division of Waterways, built the present dam and control structure in 1939. The present lock was constructed in 1958-1960 and opened for use on June 1, 1960.

The dam features a Spillway Crest 221&#x27; long at elevation 736.7, 50&#x27; long Hinged Crest Gate with variable height from 6&quot; above spillway (737.2) to 730.3; installed in 2002, and 5 Sluice Gates that are 13.75&#x27; long.

=== Extension ===
The Stratton Lock and Dam Life Extension Project, announced in 2014, included the construction of a new controlling structure immediately upstream of the 1939 dam, berm rehabilitation along the west side of the Fox River due to erosion, and the extension of the lock downstream, doubling its capacity. The work was completed before the start of the 2017 boating season.

== Operations ==
The Dam maintains the Fox Chain O&#x27;Lakes Pool levels while the Lock provides recreational passage between the Fox Chain O&#x27;Lakes in northern Illinois, and the Fox River for recreational watercraft from May through October and is closed for the winter season each year from November 1 through April 30. An average of 17,000 boats pass through the aging locks annually, along with millions of gallons of water.

The facility is owned and run by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The lock operates for all powered, sail-driven, or paddle-propelled canoes or boats, even float tubes, at no charge.

The operation goals of Stratton Dam are to maintain a recreational pool, utilize available storage in the Chain of Lakes to minimize regional flooding, maintain minimum flows for water supply and aquatic habitat, and limit flows during ice jam periods.

<doc id="1117833" wikidata="Q981016" url="?curid=1117833" title="Dirichlet distribution">
<text>In probability and statistics, the Dirichlet distribution (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet), often denoted formula_1, is a family of continuous multivariate probability distributions parameterized by a vector formula_2 of positive reals. It is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution, hence its alternative name of multivariate beta distribution (MBD). Dirichlet distributions are commonly used as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics, and in fact, the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution.

The infinite-dimensional generalization of the Dirichlet distribution is the &quot;Dirichlet process&quot;.

==Definitions==
===Probability density function===
The Dirichlet distribution of order &quot;K&quot; ≥ 2 with parameters &quot;α&quot;1, ..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;K&quot; &gt; 0 has a probability density function with respect to Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space R&quot;K-1&quot; given by

:formula_3
:where formula_4 belong to the standard formula_5 simplex, or in other words: formula_6

The normalizing constant is the multivariate beta function, which can be expressed in terms of the gamma function:

:formula_7

===Support===
The support of the Dirichlet distribution is the set of &quot;K&quot;-dimensional vectors formula_8 whose entries are real numbers in the interval [0,1] such that formula_9, i.e. the sum of the coordinates is equal to 1. These can be viewed as the probabilities of a &quot;K&quot;-way categorical event. Another way to express this is that the domain of the Dirichlet distribution is itself a set of probability distributions, specifically the set of &quot;K&quot;-dimensional discrete distributions. The technical term for the set of points in the support of a &quot;K&quot;-dimensional Dirichlet distribution is the open standard (&quot;K&quot; − 1)-simplex, which is a generalization of a triangle, embedded in the next-higher dimension. For example, with &quot;K&quot; = 3, the support is an equilateral triangle embedded in a downward-angle fashion in three-dimensional space, with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1), i.e. touching each of the coordinate axes at a point 1 unit away from the origin.

===Special cases===
A common special case is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution, where all of the elements making up the parameter vector formula_2 have the same value. The symmetric case might be useful, for example, when a Dirichlet prior over components is called for, but there is no prior knowledge favoring one component over another. Since all elements of the parameter vector have the same value, the symmetric Dirichlet distribution can be parametrized by a single scalar value &quot;α&quot;, called the concentration parameter. In terms of &quot;α,&quot; the density function has the form

:formula_11

When &quot;α&quot;=1, the symmetric Dirichlet distribution is equivalent to a uniform distribution over the open standard (&quot;K&quot; − 1)-simplex, i.e. it is uniform over all points in its support. This particular distribution is known as the flat Dirichlet distribution. Values of the concentration parameter above 1 prefer variates that are dense, evenly distributed distributions, i.e. all the values within a single sample are similar to each other. Values of the concentration parameter below 1 prefer sparse distributions, i.e. most of the values within a single sample will be close to 0, and the vast majority of the mass will be concentrated in a few of the values.

More generally, the parameter vector is sometimes written as the product formula_12 of a (scalar) concentration parameter &quot;α&quot; and a (vector) base measure formula_13 where formula_14 lies within the (&quot;K&quot; − 1)-simplex (i.e.: its coordinates formula_15 sum to one). The concentration parameter in this case is larger by a factor of &quot;K&quot; than the concentration parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution described above. This construction ties in with concept of a base measure when discussing Dirichlet processes and is often used in the topic modelling literature.
: If we define the concentration parameter as the sum of the Dirichlet parameters for each dimension, the Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter &quot;K&quot;, the dimension of the distribution, is the uniform distribution on the (&quot;K&quot; − 1)-simplex.
==Properties==

===Moments===
Let formula_16.

Let

:formula_17

Then

:formula_18
:formula_19

Furthermore, if formula_20

:formula_21

The matrix is thus singular.

More generally, moments of Dirichlet-distributed random variables can be expressed in the following way. For formula_22, denote by formula_23 its formula_24-th Hadamard power. Then,

formula_25

where the sum is over non-negative integers formula_26 with formula_27, and formula_28 is the cycle index polynomial of the Symmetric group of degree formula_29.

The multivariate analogue formula_30 for vectors formula_31 can be expressed in terms of a color pattern of the exponents formula_32 in the sense of Pólya enumeration theorem.

Particular cases include the simple computation

:formula_33

===Mode===
The mode of the distribution is the vector (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xK&quot;) with

:formula_34

===Marginal distributions===
The marginal distributions are beta distributions:

:formula_35

===Conjugate to categorical or multinomial===
The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the categorical distribution (a generic discrete probability distribution with a given number of possible outcomes) and multinomial distribution (the distribution over observed counts of each possible category in a set of categorically distributed observations). This means that if a data point has either a categorical or multinomial distribution, and the prior distribution of the distribution&#x27;s parameter (the vector of probabilities that generates the data point) is distributed as a Dirichlet, then the posterior distribution of the parameter is also a Dirichlet. Intuitively, in such a case, starting from what we know about the parameter prior to observing the data point, we then can update our knowledge based on the data point and end up with a new distribution of the same form as the old one. This means that we can successively update our knowledge of a parameter by incorporating new observations one at a time, without running into mathematical difficulties.

Formally, this can be expressed as follows. Given a model

:formula_36

then the following holds:

:formula_37

This relationship is used in Bayesian statistics to estimate the underlying parameter p of a categorical distribution given a collection of &quot;N&quot; samples. Intuitively, we can view the hyperprior vector α as pseudocounts, i.e. as representing the number of observations in each category that we have already seen. Then we simply add in the counts for all the new observations (the vector c) in order to derive the posterior distribution.

In Bayesian mixture models and other hierarchical Bayesian models with mixture components, Dirichlet distributions are commonly used as the prior distributions for the categorical variables appearing in the models. See the section on applications below for more information.

===Relation to Dirichlet-multinomial distribution===
In a model where a Dirichlet prior distribution is placed over a set of categorical-valued observations, the marginal joint distribution of the observations (i.e. the joint distribution of the observations, with the prior parameter marginalized out) is a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. This distribution plays an important role in hierarchical Bayesian models, because when doing inference over such models using methods such as Gibbs sampling or variational Bayes, Dirichlet prior distributions are often marginalized out. See the article on this distribution for more details.

===Entropy===

If &quot;X&quot; is a formula_1 random variable, the differential entropy of &quot;X&quot; (in nat units) is

:formula_39

where formula_40 is the digamma function.

The following formula for formula_41 can be used to derive the differential entropy above. Since the functions formula_42 are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, the exponential family differential identities can be used to get an analytic expression for the expectation of formula_42 (see equation (2.62) in ) and its associated covariance matrix:

:formula_44

and

:formula_45

where formula_40 is the digamma function, formula_47 is the trigamma function, and formula_48 is the Kronecker delta.

The spectrum of Rényi information for values other than formula_49 is given by

:formula_50

and the information entropy is the limit as formula_51 goes to 1.

Another related interesting measure is the entropy of a discrete categorical (one-of-K binary) vector formula_52 with probability-mass distribution formula_53, i.e., formula_54. The conditional information entropy of formula_52, given formula_53 is

:formula_57

This function of formula_53 is a scalar random variable. If formula_53 has a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with all formula_60, the expected value of the entropy (in nat units) is 

:formula_61

===Aggregation===
If

:formula_62

then, if the random variables with subscripts &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are dropped from the vector and replaced by their sum,

:formula_63

This aggregation property may be used to derive the marginal distribution of formula_64 mentioned above.

===Neutrality===
If formula_16, then the vector &quot;X&quot; is said to be &quot;neutral&quot; in the sense that &quot;XK&quot; is independent of formula_66 where

:formula_67

and similarly for removing any of formula_68. Observe that any permutation of &quot;X&quot; is also neutral (a property not possessed by samples drawn from a generalized Dirichlet distribution).

Combining this with the property of aggregation it follows that &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot; + ... + &quot;X&quot;&quot;K&quot; is independent of formula_69. In fact it is true, further, for the Dirichlet distribution, that for formula_70, the pair formula_71, and the two vectors formula_69 and formula_73, viewed as triple of normalised random vectors, are mutually independent. The analogous result is true for partition of the indices {1,2...,&quot;K&quot;} into any other pair of non-singleton subsets.

===Characteristic function===

The characteristic function of the Dirichlet distribution is a confluent form of the Lauricella hypergeometric series. It is given by Phillips as

:formula_74

where

:formula_75

The sum is over non-negative integers formula_76 and formula_77. Phillips goes on to state that this form is &quot;inconvenient for numerical calculation&quot; and gives an alternative in terms of a complex path integral:

:formula_78

where &quot;L&quot; denotes any path in the complex plane originating at formula_79, encircling in the positive direction all the singularities of the integrand and returning to formula_79.

===Inequality===
Probability density function formula_81 plays a key role in a multifunctional inequality which implies various bounds for the Dirichlet distribution.

Another inequality relates the moment-generating function of the Dirichlet distribution to the convex conjugate of the scaled reversed Kullback-Leibler divergence:

:formula_82
where the supremum is taken over formula_83 spanning the (&quot;K&quot; − 1)-simplex.

==Related distributions==
For &quot;K&quot; independently distributed Gamma distributions:

:formula_84

we have:

:formula_85
:formula_86

Although the &quot;Xi&quot;s are not independent from one another, they can be seen to be generated from a set of &quot;K&quot; independent gamma random variable. Unfortunately, since the sum &quot;V&quot; is lost in forming &quot;X&quot; (in fact it can be shown that &quot;V&quot; is stochastically independent of &quot;X&quot;), it is not possible to recover the original gamma random variables from these values alone. Nevertheless, because independent random variables are simpler to work with, this reparametrization can still be useful for proofs about properties of the Dirichlet distribution.

===Conjugate prior of the Dirichlet distribution===
Because the Dirichlet distribution is an exponential family distribution it has a conjugate prior.
The conjugate prior is of the form:

:formula_87

Here formula_88 is a &quot;K&quot;-dimensional real vector and formula_89 is a scalar parameter. The domain of formula_90 is restricted to the set of parameters for which the above unnormalized density function can be normalized. The (necessary and sufficient) condition is:

:formula_91

The conjugation property can be expressed as

: if [&quot;prior&quot;: formula_92] and [&quot;observation&quot;: formula_93] then [&quot;posterior&quot;: formula_94].

In the published literature there is no practical algorithm to efficiently generate samples from formula_95.

==Occurrence and applications== 
===Bayesian models===

Dirichlet distributions are most commonly used as the prior distribution of categorical variables or multinomial variables in Bayesian mixture models and other hierarchical Bayesian models. (In many fields, such as in natural language processing, categorical variables are often imprecisely called &quot;multinomial variables&quot;. Such a usage is unlikely to cause confusion, just as when Bernoulli distributions and binomial distributions are commonly conflated.)

Inference over hierarchical Bayesian models is often done using Gibbs sampling, and in such a case, instances of the Dirichlet distribution are typically marginalized out of the model by integrating out the Dirichlet random variable. This causes the various categorical variables drawn from the same Dirichlet random variable to become correlated, and the joint distribution over them assumes a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, conditioned on the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution (the concentration parameters). One of the reasons for doing this is that Gibbs sampling of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution is extremely easy; see that article for more information.

===Intuitive interpretations of the parameters===

====The concentration parameter====
Dirichlet distributions are very often used as prior distributions in Bayesian inference. The simplest and perhaps most common type of Dirichlet prior is the symmetric Dirichlet distribution, where all parameters are equal. This corresponds to the case where you have no prior information to favor one component over any other. As described above, the single value &quot;α&quot; to which all parameters are set is called the concentration parameter. If the sample space of the Dirichlet distribution is interpreted as a discrete probability distribution, then intuitively the concentration parameter can be thought of as determining how &quot;concentrated&quot; the probability mass of the Dirichlet distribution to its center, leading to samples with mass dispersed almost equally among all components, i.e., with a value much less than 1, the mass will be highly concentrated in a few components, and all the rest will have almost no mass, and with a value much greater than 1, the mass will be dispersed almost equally among all the components. See the article on the concentration parameter for further discussion.

====String cutting====
One example use of the Dirichlet distribution is if one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into &quot;K&quot; pieces with different lengths, where each piece had a designated average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of the pieces. Recall that formula_17 The formula_97 values specify the mean lengths of the cut pieces of string resulting from the distribution. The variance around this mean varies inversely with formula_98.

====Pólya&#x27;s urn====
Consider an urn containing balls of &quot;K&quot; different colors. Initially, the urn contains &quot;α&quot;1 balls of color 1, &quot;α&quot;2 balls of color 2, and so on. Now perform &quot;N&quot; draws from the urn, where after each draw, the ball is placed back into the urn with an additional ball of the same color. In the limit as &quot;N&quot; approaches infinity, the proportions of different colored balls in the urn will be distributed as Dir(&quot;α&quot;1...,&quot;αK&quot;).

For a formal proof, note that the proportions of the different colored balls form a bounded [0,1]&quot;K&quot;-valued martingale, hence by the martingale convergence theorem, these proportions converge almost surely and in mean to a limiting random vector. To see that this limiting vector has the above Dirichlet distribution, check that all mixed moments agree.

Each draw from the urn modifies the probability of drawing a ball of any one color from the urn in the future. This modification diminishes with the number of draws, since the relative effect of adding a new ball to the urn diminishes as the urn accumulates increasing numbers of balls.
==Random variate generation==
===From gamma distribution===
With a source of Gamma-distributed random variates, one can easily sample a random vector formula_99 from the &quot;K&quot;-dimensional Dirichlet distribution with parameters formula_100 . First, draw &quot;K&quot; independent random samples formula_101 from Gamma distributions each with density

:formula_102

and then set

:formula_103
The joint distribution of the independently sampled gamma variates, formula_104, is given by the product:

:formula_105

Next, one uses a change of variables, parametrising formula_106 in terms of formula_107 and formula_108 , and performs a change of variables from formula_109 such that formula_110. Each of the variables formula_111 and likewise formula_112. One must then use the change of variables formula, formula_113 in which formula_114 is the transformation Jacobian. Writing y explicitly as a function of x, one obtains 
formula_115
The Jacobian now looks like
:formula_116

The determinant can be evaluated by noting that it remains unchanged if multiples of a row are added to another row, and adding each of the first K-1 rows to the bottom row to obtain

:formula_117

which can be expanded about the bottom row to obtain the determinant value formula_118. Substituting for x in the joint pdf and including the Jacobian determinant, one obtains:

:formula_119
where formula_120. The right-hand side can be recognized as the product of a Dirichlet pdf for the formula_121 and a gamma pdf for formula_122. The product form shows the Dirichlet and gamma variables are independent, so the latter can be integrated out by simply omitting it, to obtain:
:formula_123

Which is equivalent to

:formula_124 with support formula_125

Below is example Python code to draw the sample:
params = [a1, a2, ..., ak]
sample = [random.gammavariate(a, 1) for a in params]
sample = [v / sum(sample) for v in sample]
This formulation is correct regardless of how the Gamma distributions are parameterized (shape/scale vs. shape/rate) because they are equivalent when scale and rate equal 1.0.

===From marginal beta distributions===
A less efficient algorithm relies on the univariate marginal and conditional distributions being beta and proceeds as follows. Simulate formula_126 from

: formula_127

Then simulate formula_128 in order, as follows. For formula_129, simulate formula_130 from

:formula_131

and let

:formula_132

Finally, set

:formula_133

This iterative procedure corresponds closely to the &quot;string cutting&quot; intuition described above.

Below is example Python code to draw the sample:
params = [a1, a2, ..., ak]
xs = [random.betavariate(params[0], sum(params[1:]))]
for j in range(1, len(params) - 1):
 phi = random.betavariate(params[j], sum(params[j + 1 :]))
 xs.append((1 - sum(xs)) * phi)
xs.append(1 - sum(xs))
===When each alpha is 1===
When , a sample from the distribution can be found by randomly drawing a set of values independently and uniformly from the interval , adding the values and to the set to make it have values, sorting the set, and computing the difference between each pair of order-adjacent values, to give , ..., .

===When each alpha is 1/2 and relationship to the hypersphere===
When , a sample from the distribution can be found by randomly drawing values independently from the standard normal distribution, squaring these values, and normalizing them by dividing by their sum, to give , ..., .

A point , ..., can be drawn uniformly at random from the ()-dimensional hypersphere (which is the surface of a -dimensional hyperball) via a similar procedure. Randomly draw values independently from the standard normal distribution and normalize these coordinate values by dividing each by the constant that is the square root of the sum of their squares.

<text>Modernization theory or modernisation theory holds that as societies become more economically modernized, wealthier and more educated, their political institutions become increasingly liberal democratic and rationalist. The &quot;classical&quot; theories of modernization of the 1950s and 1960s, most influentially articulated by Seymour Lipset, drew on sociological analyses of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Talcott Parsons. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, and saw a resurgence after 1991, when Francis Fukuyama wrote about the end of the Cold War as confirmation of modernization theory. 

The theory is the subject of much debate among scholars. Critics have highlighted cases where industrialization did not prompt stable democratization, such as Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union, as well as cases of democratic backsliding in economically advanced parts of Latin America. Other critics argue the causal relationship is reverse (democracy is more likely to lead to economic modernization) or that economic modernization helps democracies survive but does not prompt democratization. Other scholars provide supporting evidence, showing that economic development significantly predicts democratization.

== History ==

The modernization theory of the 1950s and 1960s drew on classical evolutionary theory and a Parsonian reading of Weber&#x27;s ideas about a transition from traditional to modern society. Parsons had translated Weber&#x27;s works into English in the 1930s and provided his own interpretation.

After 1945, the Parsonian version became widely used in sociology and other social sciences. Some of the thinkers associated with modernization theory are Marion J. Levy Jr., Gabriel Almond, Seymour Martin Lipset, Walt Rostow, Daniel Lerner, Lucian Pye, David Apter, Alex Inkeles, Cyril Edwin Black, Bert F. Hoselitz, Myron Weiner, and Karl Deutsch.

By the late 1960s opposition to modernization theory developed because the theory was too general and did not fit all societies in quite the same way. Yet, with the end of the Cold War, a few attempts to revive modernization theory were carried out. Francis Fukuyama argued for the use of modernization theory as universal history. A more academic effort to revise modernization theory was that of Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel in &quot;Modernization, Cultural Change, and Democracy&quot; (2005). Inglehart and Welzel amended the 1960s version of modernization theory in significant ways. Counter to Lipset, who associated industrial growth with democratization, Inglehart and Welzel did not see an association between industrialization and democratization. Rather, they held that only at a latter stage in the process of economic modernization, which various authors have characterized as post-industrial, did values conducive to democratization – which Inglehart and Welzel call &quot;self-expression values&quot; – emerge.

Nonetheless, these efforts to revive modernization theory were criticized by many, and the theory remained a controversial one.

== Modernization and democracy ==
The relationship between modernization and democracy or democratization is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. Many studies show that modernization has contributed to democracy in some countries. For example, Seymour Martin Lipset argued that modernization can turn into democracy. There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. &quot;Lipset&#x27;s observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,&quot;

Anderson explains the idea of an elongated diamond in order to describe the concentration of power in the hands of a few at the top during an authoritarian leadership. He develops this by giving an understanding of the shift in power from the elite class to the middle class that occurs when modernization is incorporated. Socioeconomic modernization allows for a democracy to further develop and influences the success of a democracy. Concluded from this, is the idea that as socioeconomic levels are leveled, democracy levels would further increase.

Larry Diamond and Juan Linz, who worked with Lipset in the book, &quot;Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America&quot;, argue that economic performance affects the development of democracy in at least three ways. First, they argue that economic growth is more important for democracy than given levels of socioeconomic development. Second, socioeconomic development generates social changes that can potentially facilitate democratization. Third, socioeconomic development promotes other changes, like organization of the middle class, which is conducive to democracy.

As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, &quot;All the various aspects of economic development—industrialization, urbanization, wealth and education—are so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy&quot;. The argument also appears in Walt W. Rostow, &quot;Politics and the Stages of Growth&quot; (1971); A. F. K. Organski, &quot;The Stages of Political Development&quot; (1965); and David Apter, &quot;The Politics of Modernization&quot; (1965). In the 1960s, some critics argued that the link between modernization and democracy was based too much on the example of European history and neglected the Third World.

One historical problem with that argument has always been Germany, whose economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the democratization after 1918. Political science professor Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for &quot;during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development&quot;.

One contemporary problem for modernization theory is the argument of whether modernization implies more human rights for citizens or not. China, one of the most rapidly growing economies in the world, can be observed as an example. The modernization theory implies that this should correlate to democratic growth in some regards, especially in relation to the liberalization of the middle and lower classes. However, active human rights abuses and constant oppression of Chinese citizens by the government seem to contradict the theory strongly. Interestingly enough, the irony is that increasing restrictions on Chinese citizens are a result of modernization theory.

In the 1990s, the Chinese government wanted to reform the legal system and emphasized governing the country by law. This led to a legal awakening for citizens as they were becoming more educated on the law, yet more understanding of their inequality in relation to the government. Looking down the line in the 2000s, Chinese citizens saw even more opportunities to liberalize and were able to be a part of urbanization and could access higher levels of education. This in turn resulted in the attitudes of the lower and middle classes changing to more liberal ideas, which went against the CCP. Over time, this has led to their active participation in civil society activities and similar adjacent political groups in order to make their voices heard. Consequently, the Chinese government represses Chinese citizens at a more aggressive rate, all due to modernization theory.

Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation.
Randall Peerenboom explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the Philippines, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and India, which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well.

Adam Przeworski and others have challenged Lipset&#x27;s argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types.

Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (2008) further weaken the case for Lipset&#x27;s argument by showing that even though there is a strong cross-country correlation between income and democracy, once one controls for country fixed effects and removes the association between income per capita and various measures of democracy, there is &quot;no causal effect of income on democracy.&quot; In &quot;Non-Modernization&quot; (2022), they further argue that modernization theory cannot account for various paths of political development &quot;because it posits a link between economics and politics that is not conditional on institutions and culture and that presumes a definite endpoint—for example, an &#x27;end of history&#x27;.&quot;

Sirianne Dahlum and Carl Henrik Knutsen offer a test of the Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel revised version of modernization theory, which focuses on cultural traits triggered by economic development that are presummed to be conducive to democratization. They find &quot;no empirical support&quot; for the Inglehart and Welzel thesis and conclude that &quot;self-expression values do not enhance democracy levels or democratization chances, and neither do they stabilize existing democracies.&quot;

A meta-analysis by Gerardo L. Munck of research on Lipset&#x27;s argument shows that a majority of studies do not support the thesis that higher levels of economic development leads to more democracy.

== Modernization and economic development ==
Modernization theorists often saw traditions as obstacles to economic development. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, economic conditions are heavily determined by the cultural, social values present in that given society. Furthermore, while modernization might deliver violent, radical change for traditional societies, it was thought worth the price. Critics insist that traditional societies were often destroyed without ever gaining the promised advantages. Others point to improvements in living standards, physical infrastructure, education and economic opportunity to refute such criticisms.

Modernization theorists such as Samuel P. Huntington held in the 1960s and 1970s that authoritarian regimes yielded greater economic growth than democracies. However, this view had been challenged. In &quot;Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950–1990&quot; (2000), Adam Przeworski argued that &quot;democracies perform as well economically as do authoritarian regimes.&quot; A study by Daron Acemoglu, Suresh Naidu, Pascual Restrepo, and James A. Robinson shows that &quot;democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita.&quot;

== Modernization and globalization ==
Globalization can be defined as the integration of economic, political and social cultures. It is argued that globalization is related to the spreading of modernization across borders.

Global trade has grown continuously since the European discovery of new continents in the early modern period; it increased particularly as a result of the Industrial Revolution and the mid-20th century adoption of the shipping container.

Annual trans-border tourist arrivals rose to 456 million by 1990 and almost tripled since, reaching a total of over 1.2 billion in 2016. Communication is another major area that has grown due to modernization. Communication industries have enabled capitalism to spread throughout the world. Telephony, television broadcasts, news services and online service providers have played a crucial part in globalization. Former U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson was a supporter of the modernization theory and believed that television had potential to provide educational tools in development.

With the many apparent positive attributes to globalization there are also negative consequences. The dominant, neoliberal model of globalization often increases disparities between a society&#x27;s rich and its poor. In major cities of developing countries there exist pockets where technologies of the modernised world, computers, cell phones and satellite television, exist alongside stark poverty. Globalists are globalization modernization theorists and argue that globalization is positive for everyone, as its benefits must eventually extend to all members of society, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.

==Applications==
===United States foreign aid in the 1960s===
President John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) relied on economists W.W. Rostow on his staff and outsider John Kenneth Galbraith for ideas on how to promote rapid economic development in the &quot;Third World&quot;, as it was called at the time. They promoted modernization models in order to reorient American aid to Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the Rostow version in his &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot; (1960) progress must pass through five stages, and for underdeveloped world the critical stages were the second one, the transition, the third stage, the takeoff into self-sustaining growth. Rostow argued that American intervention could propel a country from the second to the third stage he expected that once it reached maturity, it would have a large energized middle class that would establish democracy and civil liberties and institutionalize human rights. The result was a comprehensive theory that could be used to challenge Marxist ideologies, and thereby repel communist advances. The model provided the foundation for the Alliance for Progress in Latin America, the Peace Corps, Food for Peace, and the Agency for International Development (AID). Kennedy proclaimed the 1960s the &quot;Development Decade&quot; and substantially increased the budget for foreign assistance. Modernization theory supplied the design, rationale, and justification for these programs. The goals proved much too ambitious, and the economists in a few years abandoned the European-based modernization model as inappropriate to the cultures they were trying to impact.

Kennedy and his top advisers were working from implicit ideological assumptions regarding modernization. They firmly believed modernity was not only good for the target populations, but was essential to avoid communism on the one hand or extreme control of traditional rural society by the very rich landowners on the other. They believed America had a duty, as the most modern country in the world, to promulgate this ideal to the poor nations of the Third World. They wanted programs that were altruistic, and benevolent—and also tough, energetic, and determined. It was benevolence with a foreign policy purpose. Michael Latham has identified how this ideology worked out in three major programs the Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and the strategic hamlet program in South Vietnam. However, Latham argues that the ideology was a non-coercive version of the modernization goals of the imperialistic of Britain, France and other European countries in the 19th century.

==Criticisms and alternatives==
From the 1970s, modernization theory has been criticized by numerous scholars, including Andre Gunder Frank (1929–2005) and Immanuel Wallerstein (1930–2019). In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition, &quot;modern&quot; simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern and argue that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. That view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non western society. Others argue that Japan has become distinctly more Western as a result of its modernization.

As Tipps has argued, by conflating modernization with other processes, with which theorists use interchangeably (democratization, liberalization, development), the term becomes imprecise and therefore difficult to disprove.

The theory has also been criticised empirically, as modernization theorists ignore external sources of change in societies. The binary between traditional and modern is unhelpful, as the two are linked and often interdependent, and &quot;modernization&quot; does not come as a whole.

Modernization theory has also been accused of being Eurocentric, as modernization began in Europe, with the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution and the Revolutions of 1848 and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe. Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further and say that the view is ethnocentric and is specific to Western culture.

===Dependency theory===
One alternative model is dependency theory. It emerged in the 1950s and argues that the underdevelopment of poor nations in the Third World derived from systematic imperial and neo-colonial exploitation of raw materials. Its proponents argue that resources typically flow from a &quot;periphery&quot; of poor and underdeveloped states to a &quot;core&quot; of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theorists such as Andre Gunder Frank that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the &quot;world system&quot;.

Dependency models arose from a growing association of southern hemisphere nationalists (from Latin America and Africa) and Marxists. It was their reaction against modernization theory, which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today&#x27;s underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today&#x27;s developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.

===Barrington Moore and comparative historical analysis===
Another line of critique of modernization theory was due to sociologist Barrington Moore Jr., in his Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (1966). In this classic book, Moore argues there were at least &quot;three routes to the modern world&quot; - the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist - each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition. Counter to modernization theory, Moore held that there was not one path to the modern world and that economic development did not always bring about democracy.

===Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell and bureaucratic authoritarianism===
Political scientist Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell, in his &quot;Modernization and Bureaucratic Authoritarianism&quot; (1973) challenged the thesis, advanced most notably by Seymour Martin Lipset, that industrialization produced democracy. In South America, O&#x27;Donnell argued, industrialization generated not democracy, but bureaucratic authoritarianism.

===Acemoglu and Robinson and institutional economics===
Economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (2022), argue that modernization theory cannot account for various paths of political development &quot;because it posits a link between economics and politics that is not conditional on institutions and culture and that presumes a definite endpoint—for example, an &#x27;end of history&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="1117844" wikidata="Q1038494" url="?curid=1117844" title="Carl Gustaf m/45">
<text>The Kulsprutepistol m/45 (Kpist m/45), also known as the Carl Gustaf M/45 and the Swedish K SMG, is a 9×19mm Swedish submachine gun (SMG) designed by Gunnar Johansson, adopted in 1945 (hence the m/45 designation), and manufactured at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The m/45 was the standard submachine gun of the Swedish Army from 1945 to 1965. It was gradually replaced in Swedish service by updated Automatkarbin 4 battle rifles and Automatkarbin 5 assault rifles. The last official user of the m/45, the Swedish Home Guard (Hemvärnet), retired it from service in April 2007.

The m/45 SMG was developed in 1944–45, with a design borrowing from and also improving on many design elements of earlier submachine guns. The sheet metal stamping techniques used in making the German MP 40, the British Sten, and the Soviet PPSh-41 and PPS-43 were studied in detail. Two designs were tested in 1944, one from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori and one from Husqvarna Vapenfabriks and the prototype from Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori was chosen for further development. The first production version was adopted in 1945 as the Kpist m/45. The Danish Hovea M/49 SMG, although similar in appearance, is not a version derived from the m/45. The Hovea was a development of the failed test contender (fm44) from Husqvarna.

==Features==

The standard m/45 is a fully-automatic-only weapon without any option for semi-automatic fire. It weighs unloaded, and loaded with a 36-round box magazine. It is long with the stock extended, and long with the stock folded. The m/45 is an open bolt design with a fixed firing pin. The relatively slow cyclic rate of fire (550–600 rds/min) and low recoil of the bolt-mechanism actuation (straight blowback) makes it easy to control during full automatic fire. Single shots are also easy to achieve (with very little training) by letting go of the trigger before another round is cycled. The m/45 is fairly accurate up to 200 meters.

Accessories include a special sub-calibre barrel (painted silver) for firing blanks and low-powered gallery ammunition. When firing blanks, a cone shaped blank firing adapter must be attached to the threaded muzzle of the sub-calibre barrel (and secured by a clip) to ensure the mechanism has adequate pressure for its blowback operation. Other accessories include night sights (wartime use only) that attach to the fixed day sights (f: protected post, r: L-type), a brass catcher for collecting spent cartridges (peacetime use only, for reloading and recycling), a quick-detachable (by attached cord) ejection port cover (painted bright red) for guard duty which secures the bolt from accidental firing, and a magazine loader that loads a magazine from a cartridge tray in seconds. The m/45 was also issued with a standard cleaning kit containing a threaded cleaning rod, threaded jag and a container for the jag, lubricant and cleaning patches. The standard sling issued was made of leather, attached to the rear left receiver and left barrel-sleeve sling bars.

The 36-round straight detachable staggered row box magazine is wider at the rear than at the front, the extra space allows the tapered 9mm Parabellum cartridges to feed more efficiently. The trapezium design makes the magazine very reliable in dusty environments and sub-zero temperatures, because magazines of parallel-side design are more likely to jam under adverse conditions. The magazine was used post-war by Finland in the m/31 Suomi under the designation m/54, a distinguishing feature of the variation m/55 (made by Lapua) is a steel wire carrying loop mounted at the bottom front edge. The basic design idea of the m/45 magazine was also used for the magazines of the Czech model 23 and model 25 and the French MAS submachine guns.

The m/45 has no safety switch. Instead the m/45 is put in &quot;safe&quot; by sliding the cocking handle into a short side-slot above the main (lock) slot. In the example US Army photograph, this short safety side-slot is visible behind the rear L-sight. When the m/45 is unloaded the bolt is locked in place in the bolt-forward position by pushing the cocking handle inwards, engaging a hole in the lower left receiver wall.

==Variants==
* First production: The SMG models Kpist m/45 and Kpist m/45S (integrated suppressor, never used in Sweden) feature a detachable (via removable clip) magazine support. It accepts the kpist m/37-39 50-round &quot;coffin&quot; magazine and the later standard 36-round box magazine. The m/45 has a dark gun metal finish.
* General production: The m/45B model features a fixed magazine support, smaller holes in the barrel shroud, a strengthened bolt buffer (in the receiver-rear), and a hook securing the buffer cap in place. Early m/45B models have the same metal finish as the m/45 but most have a dull green lacquer finish. Over time, most first production m/45s were converted by permanently riveting the magazine support to the receiver.
* UN/ONU and ceremonial: The m/45C is an m/45B with a bayonet mount on the barrel sleeve which was used for parade and guard duties. During the Congo Crisis in the 1960s, the Swedish UN forces used the C version extensively. The standard m/45 and m/45B have no bayonet mount.
* Police: The Swedish Police used the m/45 as a reinforcement weapon, issued to specially trained police officers under exceptional circumstances like terrorist attacks and armed robberies. Unlike the military model it was equipped with a selector switch for full auto or semi-auto fire. The police model designation was m/45BE (E = (single-shot)) and BET (T = (tear gas)). The BET model was later locked to semi-auto with a screw to the selector switch. The police model has an all black finish, in contrast to the slate grey phosphate and enamel green of the military versions. In the mid to late 1970s the BE version was retrofitted with a modified stock (m/75) with a removable upper cheekpiece allowing the operator to wear a visored riot protection helmet ( m/69). The BET model was only used to fire a tear gas canister ( m/74). To be able to fire the canister, a special blank cartridge (9mm lös ptr m/T) had to be used. A red sticker on the left side of the weapon reminded the operator that only blank ammunition could be used. The BET also had a high front sight and an adjustable rear sight (30, 45 and 60 meters). The m/45 BET was replaced by Heckler &amp; Koch MZP-1 (HP 40) in the early/mid 1990s because it was regarded unfashionable and also because new tear gas canisters became hard to obtain since they contained the hazardous substance: Freon-12.

==Manufacture and use==

The Swedish Army list price of the Carl Gustaf m/45 in the late 1970s was around 600 Swedish kronor.

The Carl Gustaf m/45 was replaced as main infantry weapon in the Swedish Armed Forces during the mid-1960s with the 7.62mm Automatkarbin 4 battle rifle, but remained in use for auxiliary troops like artillery gun crews, supply- and engineering troops and the like until starting in 1986 being replaced with the 5.56mm Ak 5 assault rifle. On 2 April 2007 the kpist m/45 was officially declared obsolete when it was retired from the Home Guard who were the last users in the Swedish Armed Forces.

In addition to Sweden, several other countries have used the weapon, with versions of the weapon being produced in Egypt and the United States.

===Licensed production in Egypt===

The m/45 has been manufactured under license in Egypt as the &quot;Port Said&quot; and the &quot;Akaba&quot;. The tooling needed for production, as well as technical assistance, was sold by Sweden to Egypt during the 1950s. The &quot;Port Said&quot; looks and functions exactly as the m/45 (first version while the Akaba is a modified and simplified version). The &quot;Akaba&quot; has no barrel jacket and a slightly shorter barrel and the folding butt stock has been replaced by a telescoping wire butt stock similar to the one used on the US M3A1. The simplified sights of the &quot;Akaba&quot; were moved to the front (unprotected post) and back (protected peep) of the receiver.

===Use by the United States in Southeast Asia===
During the Vietnam War, the US Navy SEALs used the m/45 extensively. One of the gun&#x27;s qualities which appealed to the US Navy was that the m/45 can fire almost immediately out of the water (over the beach). It also saw use by CIA operatives and advisers. In US service it was largely known as the &quot;Swedish-K&quot; or &quot;K-Rifle&quot;. The US Navy was so impressed by the m/45 that when Sweden embargoed the export of weapons to the United States in 1966, Smith &amp; Wesson was given the task of producing a copy. This was designated the Smith &amp; Wesson M76. However, by the time the M76 was ready for combat deployment, the US Navy interest had largely evaporated. Many of the m/45s used by US forces and agencies were devoid of markings, implying clandestine use (&quot;sanitized&quot;).

===Illegal production in South America===
In 1975, the Revolutionary Coordinating Junta, a Cuban-backed far-left internationalist organization, established a clandestine military factory in Buenos Aires. Although it was easy to produce explosives, there was a severe lack of materials to make firearms. In order to revert this, a Bolivian engineer, nicknamed &quot;Comrade N&quot;, aiming to design &quot;a submachine gun with the characteristics of an Uzi, but easier to build and disassemble and using 9mm ammunition&quot; came out with the JCR-1. It was presented by the Argentinian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army through its newspaper as a lightweight and concealable weapon. Approximately 5,000 units were manufactured, though only a few hundred could be assembled until the Argentine Army dismantled the factory in late 1975.

<doc id="1117855" wikidata="Q4052245" url="?curid=1117855" title="USS Maddox (DD-168)">
<text>USS &quot;Maddox&quot; (DD–168) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Georgetown&quot; (I40), to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS &quot;Georgetown, and then to the [[Soviet Navy]] as Doblestny (or Zhyostky&quot;; sources vary). She was the last &quot;four piper&quot; destroyer to be scrapped.

== Construction and career ==
=== United States Navy service ===
Named for William A. T. Maddox, she was laid down on 20 July 1918 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 27 October 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Clarence N. Hinkamp, granddaughter of Captain Maddox. &quot;Maddox&quot; was commissioned on 10 March 1919. On 17 July 1920 she was designated DD-168.

Assigned to Division 21, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Maddox&quot; departed Boston 3 May 1919 for Trepassey, Newfoundland, en route to the Azores where she became part of a &quot;bridge of ships&quot; assigned to guide US Navy flying boats NC-1 and NC-4 across the ocean on the first transatlantic flight. Returning to Boston on 22 May, the destroyer operated out of there until she sailed for Europe on 26 August 1919. Arriving at Brest, France on 19 September, she soon joined an honor escort for , then bound for Ostend, Belgium, to embark the Belgian King and Queen for the United States. Detached on 25 September, &quot;Maddox&quot; commenced cross-channel service. Until 24 October she escorted ships and carried naval and Army passengers from Dover and Harwich to Boulogne, France, and the Hook of Holland. Departing Harwich on 25 October, the four stacker proceeded through Kiel Canal to visit various Baltic ports.

Returning to the United States on 12 February 1920, &quot;Maddox&quot; operated out of Boston for the next 2 years, off the east coast. Departing Boston on 25 February 1922 for Philadelphia, she decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 14 June 1922.

Inactive for the next 18 years, &quot;Maddox&quot; recommissioned on 17 June 1940. After brief duty on mid-Atlantic Neutrality Patrol, she departed Newport, Rhode Island on 16 September 1940 for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she decommissioned on 23 September 1940. The same day, under the destroyer-naval base agreement, she was transferred to Great Britain and commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Georgetown&quot;.

=== Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy service ===

As &quot;Georgetown&quot;, she participated in operation &quot;Bowery&quot;, escorting the aircraft carrier in May 1942 on her second reinforcement of the Supermarine Spitfire strength on the island of Malta. In September 1942, she transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy for convoy escort duties in the western Atlantic, captained by Lt. Cdr. Peter Graeme MacIver. &quot;Georgetown&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine launcher. Returned to the United Kingdom in December 1943, she joined the Reserve Fleet.

=== In Soviet service ===

In August 1944 &quot;Georgetown&quot; was turned over to the Soviet Navy. She was renamed (sources vary) either &quot;Doblestny &quot; (rus. &quot;Glorious or Valiant&quot;) or &quot;Zhyostky&quot; (rus. &quot;Rigid&quot;).

She was returned to the Royal Navy on 9 September 1952 and scrapped on 16 September 1952.

<doc id="1117859" wikidata="Q3258337" url="?curid=1117859" title="Landau distribution">
<text>In probability theory, the Landau distribution is a probability distribution named after Lev Landau.
Because of the distribution&#x27;s &quot;fat&quot; tail, the moments of the distribution, such as mean or variance, are undefined. The distribution is a particular case of stable distribution.

==Definition==
The probability density function, as written originally by Landau, is defined by the complex integral:

:formula_1

where &quot;a&quot; is an arbitrary positive real number, meaning that the integration path can be any parallel to the imaginary axis, intersecting the real positive semi-axis, and formula_2 refers to the natural logarithm.
In other words it is the Laplace transform of the function formula_3.

The following real integral is equivalent to the above:

:formula_4

The full family of Landau distributions is obtained by extending the original distribution to a location-scale family of stable distributions with parameters formula_5 and formula_6, with characteristic function:

:formula_7

where formula_8 and formula_9, which yields a density function:

:formula_10

Taking formula_11 and formula_12 we get the original form of formula_13 above.

==Properties==
* Translation: If formula_14 then formula_15.
* Scaling: If formula_14 then formula_17.
* Sum: If formula_18 and formula_19 then formula_20.

These properties can all be derived from the characteristic function.
Together they imply that the Landau distributions are closed under affine transformations.

=== Approximations ===

In the &quot;standard&quot; case formula_11 and formula_22, the pdf can be approximated using Lindhard theory which says:

:formula_23

where formula_24 is Euler&#x27;s constant.

A similar approximation of formula_25 for formula_11 and formula_27 is:

:formula_28

==Related distributions==
* The Landau distribution is a stable distribution with stability parameter formula_29 and skewness parameter formula_30 both equal to 1.

<doc id="1117864" wikidata="Q208550" url="?curid=1117864" title="Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi">
<text>, also known as Yoshi Kawaguchi, is a retired Japanese footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

Kawaguchi spent most of his professional career in the Japanese J1 League, with brief spells in Europe as a reserve goalkeeper. He has earned 116 international caps for Japan, making him one of the ten most capped players in the history of the team. He additionally served as captain from 2006 to 2008. He was part of the Japanese squads at the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 editions of the FIFA World Cups, the 2004 and 2007 editions of the AFC Asian Cups, as well as the 1999 Copa América.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Born in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture, Kawaguchi studied at Shimizu Commercial High School and was a member of the football team there. After finishing high school, he joined the professional football team Yokohama Marinos (later &quot;Yokohama F. Marinos&quot;).

=== Portsmouth ===
Following impressive performances for both club and country, he moved to English club Portsmouth, signing for a club record £1.8m. However, he struggled to adapt to life in the English Football League, and struggled with the physical side of the First Division, notably in a 3–1 away defeat to Grimsby Town. Kawaguchi lost his place to veteran Dave Beasant after being held responsible for Portsmouth&#x27;s 4–1 home defeat to underdogs Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. Despite his poor performances for Pompey he remained something of a cult hero with the fans, on account of his cheerful demeanour, and his insistence that he would work hard to regain his place. After a season of playing reserve team football, he made his final appearance for Portsmouth in the final game of the 2002–03 Football League First Division championship winning season, coming on at half time to a standing ovation in the 5–0 win against Bradford City.

=== Nordsjælland ===
Despite this brief reappearance, he realised that his future lay elsewhere, and moved on to Nordsjælland of the Danish league.

=== Júbilo Iwata ===
Prior to the 2005 Japanese football season, Kawaguchi returned to his home country when he signed with then-perennial title-contenders Júbilo Iwata.

== International career ==

=== Early career (1996–2001) ===
Kawaguchi was called up to the Japan national team and played in the Atlanta Olympic games. He kept a clean sheet against Brazil in the first game. He played in Japan&#x27;s first ever World Cup game in 1998 in a 1–0 defeat to Argentina, and throughout the tournament, his stellar performance prevented Japan from being scored more than one, with all three Japanese defeats were just one-goal margin. In 2001, Kawaguchi was Japan&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper as the team finished runner-up in the Confederations Cup.

=== Captain (2004–2006) ===
Kawaguchi is a noted penalty stopper, making two saves in the shootout against Jordan in the 2004 Asian Cup quarter-final and also saving from Croatia&#x27;s Darijo Srna in the 2006 World Cup. During the 2007 Asian Cup he was instrumental in Japan&#x27;s quarter-final win against Australia making two saves from Harry Kewell and Lucas Neill in the penalty shootout, thus making him the Man of the Match.

In August 2006, it was revealed that he would wear the captain&#x27;s armband, as new Japan manager Ivica Osim believed that former captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto was not getting enough playing time at his domestic club, Gamba Osaka.

=== Marginal role (2008–2010) ===
Kawaguchi is his country&#x27;s most-capped goalkeeper and overall third most-capped player with 116 caps for Japan, six behind second-placed Masami Ihara with 122 caps, but an injury in 2008 had since sidelined him from action. Long-time rival Seigo Narazaki had since been playing as first-choice keeper for Japan.

A broken leg sustained in a J1 League clash against Kyoto Sanga appeared to have sidelined him for the rest of the season, thus ruling him out of the 2010 World Cup. However, after making a full and quick recovery, Japanese head coach Takeshi Okada decided to include him in the final squad announced on 10 May 2010. Kawaguchi was one of two Japanese players (the other being Seigo Narazaki) to be named for their national team&#x27;s fourth consecutive World Cup. Despite his period of inactivity, and having fallen to third in the pecking order, Okada selected him in the hope that his leadership and experience would aid the team&#x27;s progress. Kawaguchi was appointed captain of the national team during team training on 21 May 2010.

Kawaguchi was not picked to play for the national team under coach Alberto Zaccheroni, and with youngster Eiji Kawashima impressing in Japan&#x27;s 2011 Asian Cup success, Kawaguchi&#x27;s international career was effectively over.

<text>The Honda VFR400 series of motorcycles were a related series of 399 cc V4-engined motorcycles, which were essentially scaled-down versions of the larger VFR race models of the day. They were mainly developed for, and sold in, the Japanese domestic market, in part due to the tougher motorcycle drivers&#x27; license restrictions in Japan at the time for motorcycles with displacement exceeding 400cc.

Outside Japan, the VFR400R (NC30) was officially imported to the United Kingdom for four years, but with a price tag of £5899 (similar to that of the 1000 cc bikes of the time and actually more than Honda&#x27;s own VFR750F), failed to sell well. It was also officially imported (in very limited numbers) and sold in Austria, France and Germany for a few years.

Although mainly produced for the Japanese domestic market, VFR400s have been popular as grey imports in other regions (especially so for the NC30 in the United Kingdom, and also for racing purposes in the United States) in the &quot;mini&quot; superbike segment.

VFR400 engines produce a noticeable whine when the engine is running, due to the cams being driven by straight cut gears, rather than chains or belts.

==Model history==
The first generation of VFR400 was the 1986–1987 NC21, which had replaced the VF400F when the Honda VF series was phased out (mainly due to reliability issues with the head and cam chain). 

This model came in 4 designations, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;K&quot; and a police version with the &quot;P&quot; designation. The &quot;R&quot; model (VFR400R) was the most common. Multiple colour schemes were also available for each. The &quot;R&quot; had a full fairing and single headlight. The &quot;Z&quot; model was semi faired (side fairings and belly pan) and had 2 round headlights. The &quot;K&quot; and &quot;P&quot; both had a single round headlight and bar risers to give a more upright riding position. 

All had a single piece seat for rider and pillion, 3 spoke cast wheels (16&quot; front and 18&quot; rear), an aluminum frame with steel rear subframe, and a conventional dual-sided aluminum swing arm with single shock. The clutch was hydraulically actuated and the front left fork featured Hondas TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Circuit) system with adjustable damping on the right fork. This had 4 stage adjustment on the bottom of the fork. Both forks featured air assist. The engine was a 180° degree crank firing version, and had a rpm redline of 13000rpm on the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, the &quot;K&quot; and &quot;P&quot; had a redline of 14000rpm. A small number of NC21s (VFR400R) were imported new into New Zealand in 1987.

The 2nd generation of VFR400 was the VFR400R NC24, produced for the 1987 and 1988 model years, it was one of the first production Honda motorcycle to utilize an ELF-designed Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm (which later became one of the trademarks of the Honda VFR series). Discontinued with this model were the hydraulically actuated clutch which was switched back to a cable system, and while the TRAC anti dive system on the front left fork was retained, it was not adjustable. The cast wheels were updated to 8 spoke rear and 6 spoke front. Styling remained close to the NC21, with both having the same aluminium frame and with the NC24 keeping the VFR400R NC21&#x27;s single large headlight and the exhaust silencer on the right side although the silencer was mounted higher up. The seat was changed to a separate seat for the rider and pillion each. This model also had the 180° deg crank firing engine as with the NC21, but redline was raised to 14000 rpm and the CDI dropped the cam position sensor input that the NC21 used. The NC24 was available in three colour schemes in 1987 (including an official Rothmans replica), and one in 1988. Note that the rear wheel on the NC24 was held onto the hub with 4 bolts (sometimes hidden with a plastic &#x27;fake&#x27; single nut).

The third generation of VFR400R was the best known version, the VFR400R NC30. This saw styling changes, most notably the headlights were updated to smaller twin headlights, much the same as the RC30, and relocation of the silencer to the left side, which gave a more open look to the rear wheel on the right side. This model saw the introduction of the 360° crank firing engine, which is also known as the &quot;big bang&quot; engine. The tachometer red-line was also raised to 14500 rpm. The NC30 was also officially sold in limited numbers in several European countries. The official European models were sometimes installed with a different CDI (ignition device), no restriction, speedometer that reached to and larger headlights (Germany) and were rated at 65hp. The NC30 was produced between 1989 and 1992, though unsold bikes were still available to purchase from Honda dealers for several years thereafter. The NC30 reflected the styling of its iconic bigger brother, the VFR750R (RC30), right down to its 18-inch rear wheel. Front wheel changed from the 16&quot; on the NC21/24 to a 17&quot; on the NC30. Japanese-spec NC30s were available in a total of eight different colour schemes, produced with three different model year specifications (1989, 1990 and 1992). Export models were made in two different colour schemes, and carried model year designations &quot;L&quot; and &quot;M&quot; (1990 and 1991).

The official UK model has the following distinguishable features: slightly larger front and rear direction indicators; additional rear number plate light (separate from rear lamp) oil cooler, 60/55 watt headlamp bulbs, and a MPH speedo. The official UK bikes were only ever available in two colour schemes.

The Honda VFR400R NC30 is widely regarded as being a fine handling motorcycle. The engine has a very wide powerband for a 400cc engine, which made it a perfect beginners-superbike. It has a hardcore fanbase, especially in Japan and the UK, where the NC30 is a popular track-day and racing bike.

===Successors===
As the RC30 was eventually replaced by the RVF750R (RC45), the VFR400R NC30 evolved into the RVF400R NC35, which was produced between 1994 and 1996. This model featured inverted forks and an updated racing-style fairing.

==Speed restriction==
In the Japanese market, 400 cc motorcycles were once restricted by top speed, but these restrictions can be removed through various means, including the fitting of an ignition &quot;black box&quot;. The VFR400R is restricted by means of an optical sensor inside the speedometer, and a black sector attached to the indicator needle shaft. When needle swings round to the sector starts to block the sensor, ignition is cut to the front two cylinders thereby reducing power such that the motorcycle can not accelerate further.

Some models also had power restrictions, this was most commonly a restriction washer in each of the rubber sections between the carbs and cylinder inlet.

==Technical specifications==
===Performance===

<doc id="1117869" wikidata="Q1934245" url="?curid=1117869" title="Stable distribution">
<text>In probability theory, a distribution is said to be stable if a linear combination of two independent random variables with this distribution has the same distribution, up to location and scale parameters. A random variable is said to be stable if its distribution is stable. The stable distribution family is also sometimes referred to as the Lévy alpha-stable distribution, after Paul Lévy, the first mathematician to have studied it.

Of the four parameters defining the family, most attention has been focused on the stability parameter, formula_1 (see panel). Stable distributions have formula_2, with the upper bound corresponding to the normal distribution, and formula_3 to the Cauchy distribution. The distributions have undefined variance for formula_4, and undefined mean for formula_5. The importance of stable probability distributions is that they are &quot;attractors&quot; for properly normed sums of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables. The normal distribution defines a family of stable distributions. By the classical central limit theorem the properly normed sum of a set of random variables, each with finite variance, will tend toward a normal distribution as the number of variables increases. Without the finite variance assumption, the limit may be a stable distribution that is not normal. Mandelbrot referred to such distributions as &quot;stable Paretian distributions&quot;, after Vilfredo Pareto. In particular, he referred to those maximally skewed in the positive direction with formula_6 as &quot;Pareto–Lévy distributions&quot;, which he regarded as better descriptions of stock and commodity prices than normal distributions.

==Definition==
A non-degenerate distribution is a stable distribution if it satisfies the following property:

Since the normal distribution, the Cauchy distribution, and the Lévy distribution all have the above property, it follows that they are special cases of stable distributions.

Such distributions form a four-parameter family of continuous probability distributions parametrized by location and scale parameters &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, respectively, and two shape parameters formula_7 and formula_1, roughly corresponding to measures of asymmetry and concentration, respectively (see the figures).

The characteristic function formula_9 of any probability distribution is the Fourier transform of its probability density function formula_10. The density function is therefore the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function:
formula_11

Although the probability density function for a general stable distribution cannot be written analytically, the general characteristic function can be expressed analytically. A random variable &quot;X&quot; is called stable if its characteristic function can be written as
formula_12
where is just the sign of and
formula_13
&quot;μ&quot; ∈ R is a shift parameter, formula_14, called the &quot;skewness parameter&quot;, is a measure of asymmetry. Notice that in this context the usual skewness is not well defined, as for formula_4 the distribution does not admit 2nd or higher moments, and the usual skewness definition is the 3rd central moment.

The reason this gives a stable distribution is that the characteristic function for the sum of two independent random variables equals the product of the two corresponding characteristic functions. Adding two random variables from a stable distribution gives something with the same values of formula_1 and formula_7, but possibly different values of &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.

Not every function is the characteristic function of a legitimate probability distribution (that is, one whose cumulative distribution function is real and goes from 0 to 1 without decreasing), but the characteristic functions given above will be legitimate so long as the parameters are in their ranges. The value of the characteristic function at some value &quot;t&quot; is the complex conjugate of its value at −&quot;t&quot; as it should be so that the probability distribution function will be real.

In the simplest case formula_18, the characteristic function is just a stretched exponential function; the distribution is symmetric about &quot;μ&quot; and is referred to as a (Lévy) symmetric alpha-stable distribution, often abbreviated &quot;SαS&quot;.

When formula_19 and formula_20, the distribution is supported on [&quot;μ&quot;, ∞).

The parameter &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 is a scale factor which is a measure of the width of the distribution while formula_1 is the exponent or index of the distribution and specifies the asymptotic behavior of the distribution.

=== Parametrizations ===
The parametrization of stable distributions is not unique. Nolan tabulates 11 parametrizations seen in the literature and gives conversion formulas. The two most commonly used parametrizations are the one above (Nolan&#x27;s &quot;1&quot;) and the one immediately below (Nolan&#x27;s &quot;0&quot;).

The parametrization above is easiest to use for theoretical work, but its probability density is not continuous in the parameters at formula_22. A continuous parametrization, better for numerical work, is
formula_23
where:
formula_24

The ranges of formula_1 and formula_7 are the same as before, &quot;γ&quot; (like &quot;c&quot;) should be positive, and &quot;δ&quot; (like &quot;μ&quot;) should be real.

In either parametrization one can make a linear transformation of the random variable to get a random variable whose density is formula_27. In the first parametrization, this is done by defining the new variable:
formula_28

For the second parametrization, simply use
formula_29
independent of formula_1. In the first parametrization, if the mean exists (that is, formula_31) then it is equal to &quot;μ&quot;, whereas in the second parametrization when the mean exists it is equal to formula_32

===The distribution===
A stable distribution is therefore specified by the above four parameters. It can be shown that any non-degenerate stable distribution has a smooth (infinitely differentiable) density function. If formula_33 denotes the density of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is the sum of independent copies of &quot;X&quot;:
formula_34
then &quot;Y&quot; has the density formula_35 with
formula_36

The asymptotic behavior is described, for formula_4, by:
formula_38
* Let formula_39 be the modified Bessel function of the second kind, then: formula_40
* Let formula_41 denote the hypergeometric functions, then: formula_42 with the latter being the Holtsmark distribution.
* Let formula_43 be a Whittaker function, then: formula_44

It calculates the density (pdf), cumulative distribution function (cdf) and quantiles for a general stable distribution, and performs maximum likelihood estimation of stable parameters and some exploratory data analysis techniques for assessing the fit of a data set.
* The GNU Scientific Library which is written in C has a package &quot;randist&quot;, which includes among the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions also an implementation of the Levy alpha-stable distribution, both with and without a skew parameter.
* libstable is a C implementation for the Stable distribution pdf, cdf, random number, quantile and fitting functions (along with a benchmark replication package and an R package).
* R Package &#x27;stabledist&#x27; by Diethelm Wuertz, Martin Maechler and Rmetrics core team members. Computes stable density, probability, quantiles, and random numbers.
* Python implementation is located in scipy.stats.levy_stable in the SciPy package.
* Julia provides package StableDistributions.jl which has methods of generation, fitting, probability density, cumulative distribution function, characteristic and moment generating functions, quantile and related functions, convolution and affine transformations of stable distributions. It uses modernised algorithms improved by John P. Nolan.
